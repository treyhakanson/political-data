This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Jedediah Bila, Juan Williams, Meghan McCain and Tom Shillue. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this right here is ""The Five.""Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are now closing in on the magic numbers to clinch their nominations. Both are less than 100 delegates away. More election developments in just a minute including some breaking Trump news today. And get this, breaking Sanders news. Sanders just agreed to do a Fox News debate, but will Hillary Clinton follow suit? We'll be here for another 59 minutes and 30 seconds in case she wants to call in. We challenge her, will you come to that debate. But first, we will go out to Silicon Valley where Mark Zuckerberg is holding that damage control meeting with conservatives about a half-hour from now at Facebook to social network under fire for alleged political bias following accusation it suppresses conservative stories in its trending news feed. Now our very own Dana Perino, Perino will be at that meeting and she joins us now from outside Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, right before you go. And Dana, are you ready for the big smackdown? Are you going to take him? Shake him and say Mark, conservatives matter, too! Conservative lives matter, too!DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: I was thinking of a hashtag that I could work on like Perino atomic elbow or something like that.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: I have one, believe it or not. I wish you guys were here, because it is really interesting to get out of, you know, our New York bubble, our Washington, D.C. bubble and to come out here to a different bubble, really, and to have, have a chance to be at this meeting. I'll be back in New York tomorrow. I'll report all about it. I'll be on ""The Kelly File"" later tonight. People are gathering. We're going to go there and just about 25 minutes. And so I go in with an open mind. I'm pretty curious about a couple of things. One, certainly about how the technology works and how the, how the algorithm gets put together so that you pick up the news trends feed. But the other thing that I've learned Eric, in just the interaction that we've had in this, about the story over the past few days is that there's some frustration about Facebook, not necessarily about news trends. And the conservatives have some sort of natural anxiety about being suppressed in terms of thought or news and that social media, which was a great boon to conservatives, because you could speak direct to people. When Facebook decided to get into the news business, it opened itself to this kind of criticism. And so I think that this meeting is at least their attempt to get in front of it in some way.BOLLING: All right, Dana, we're going to bring it around the table, just one, one quick question. A lot of, there are some of the criticism that's been levied as to, as to the group that Zuckerberg brought is that it tend to, it looked like it tended to be an anti-Trump crowd, but tell me, are there, is the full spectrum of conservatism represented there today?PERINO: Well, I think that even if when, I think they have 12 people coming. Even within those 12, I don't know if they would encompass all the different types of conservatism. Conservatism right now is a pretty big tent. And when it comes to Donald Trump, you know, Barry Bennett who had been on the Ben Carson campaign and done very well for Ben Carson then joined the Trump campaign and he is here and he was quoted in a ""New York Times"" this morning saying that he was looking forward to the meeting. He thought they had been very responsive. And so he'll be here as well as I saw Arthur Brooks and I know S.E. Cupp is going to be here and again, I'll report all that I can tomorrow, but I think leading into it, I do have to go into it with an open mind. I don't know what to expect. I don't have high expectations or low expectations. I just have a lot of curiosity both about the policy and the content, and then just bigger picture moving forward. If Facebook's mission is to be inclusive, then -- now that it's such a huge company with so much power. The choice is Facebook's, right? It's how do you use that inclusivity or how do you insure it. And I think this meeting is kind of, therefore set to try and figure out as we go grow as a company. If we're going to continue to do more on the news side of things, then we have to be aware that conservatives have a natural suspicion when it comes to suppression of their ideas or storylines, et cetera.BOLLING: All right. We'll bring it around Jedediah.JEDEDIAH BILA, GUEST CO-HOST: Dana, when this story broke there was -- there seemed to be really swift action on the part of Facebook.PERINO: I'm not sure if I can hear you.BOLLING: Can you hear --BILA: You got me?BOLLING: Can you hear us?BILA: Got me, no?BOLLING: Can you hear us? Do we lose you? Are you there?(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: All right, then.BILA: We'll get her back.BOLLING: Oh well then, I'll tell you what we'll do. Let's talk about what is going on with what Dana just said. Go ahead, Meghan, you want to weigh in?MEGHAN MCCAIN, GUEST CO-HOST: I wanted to ask you, I read this (inaudible) poll today that said 68 percent of republicans now have an unfavorable view, that's 68 percent drop of Facebook. And when you have a PR disaster like this, which I think at this point you can call it a PR disaster. They're not calling in Dana Perino to Silicon Valley if it isn't. How do you possibly regain that trust? I don't like Mark Zuckerberg. I don't like him for a long time. I don't trust Facebook. I haven't trusted them since RNC in `08 when they went out of their way not to include themselves in the convention and Zuckerberg bragged about it and it end up being a total lie and she got called out on it. How do you regain that fact?BOLLING: I don't, do you think -- we'll bring it around but don't you think by doing exactly what he's doing, bringing Dana Perino, S.E. Cupp --MCCAIN: I hope so.BOLLING: Hold on, we have Dana. Dana, Meghan makes a good point, how does Facebook -- how do you, this Facebook regain your trust? What would you need to hear?PERINO: You're asking me, right?BOLLING: Yup.PERINO: Now I can hear you. So a couple of things, first of all Facebook said that this is not their policy. And it doesn't make sense for it to be their policy, because it doesn't make business sense to cut off sort of half the country from trusting you. The second thing is they have people here that are going to show us the algorithm, how that's put together. Eric, you brought up a good point you talked yesterday. Talking about what is the difference between algorithms when it comes to different social media platforms, like Twitter and Facebook, different audiences, at least from my followers, as I see, but what is the difference when it comes to the news trends? And here's the other thing. I'm a big proponent of getting face to face with people to have a conversation if you have a concern or a controversy. It makes communication a lot easier. So that's really kind of the first step to building and keeping trust is actually having a relationship with people. I don't make it out to Silicon Valley very often. I've never met Mark Zuckerberg. He might not even know who I am. But having a meeting like this along with all the other people that are assembled here and maybe they'll have more in the future with other people, I think that's the first step to building trust because that trust builds up over years, but it takes only a minute or two to destroy it.BOLLING: Right. And Dana, we have three questions left about six minutes, so that said Jedediah.(CROSSTALK)BILA: Zuckerberg himself has been very politically outspoken in climate change, immigration --PERINO: Yeah.BILA: Numerous issues he's been very outspoken on. Do you think that was a mistake now? Do you think he regrets that looking back? And maybe that's part of when people look at Facebook and what's going on. They may look at the story through that lens.PERINO: So I think that there is a separation that you can do in your mind in terms of politics and business, like your personal philosophy and your business. The problem I think for him is that he's been so public about his view points when it comes to climate change, immigration. Absolutely has right to have them, but he does have to understand that that could bleed over into a story like this when conservatives are concerned there's been suppression of their viewpoints or their news stories, and then they looked at, you know, and they've seen the speeches that he's given and the donations and such like that of other people around Facebook. And it does make you wonder what's happening. So this could be a lesson for them as well that if you're going to have a CEO that's this powerful in this public, that you don't run a risk that your personal viewpoints are going to bleed over into the business.BOLLING: OK, Juan.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Dana, one of the things that strikes me in terms of the politics is the Joe Kaplan who is a well-known republican who clerked for Justice Scalia, works for Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook in D.C. So do you know Mr. Kaplan? And do you trust him to help repair this damage? Because part of his work in D.C. is to lobby conservatives to get them involved with Facebook. I think Rick Scott, Ben Carson have all used Facebook to their advantage in terms of their conservative campaigns.PERINO: Well, and not only that. But he has a responsibility of dealing with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement or CIA, Intel issues, like we've talked about that on the show before and how does Silicon Valley strike that balance and work appropriately with law enforcement when it needs to. And I also think that a lot of those campaigns like Ben Carson's campaign for example, really were fuelled by its ability to utilize Facebook, share content with voters or potential voters. And remember, all of those donations, he ran various successful campaigns, interestingly. Barry Bennett who is going to be here at this meeting for Donald Trump's team, he was on Ben Carson team .WILLIAMS: Right.PERINO: . it really ran that. So I think they understand the value of Facebook when it comes to conservatives. I think it's there. I think that this concern about suppression of news stories when it comes to conservatives ran the risk of upsetting some of those good partnerships. I will also leave with you this one. Two weeks ago, Facebook was pressured to withdraw from the republican convention by leftist groups and Facebook said, ""No. We are definitely going to go to the republican convention and the democratic convention."" But they weren't intimidated into leaving the Cleveland party that they're going to be throwing.BOLLING: OK, Tom.PERINO: And the partnerships, the technology that they do.BOLLING: Tom Shillue.TOM SHILLUE, GUEST CO-HOST: Dana, I'm sure they're going to work out this thing with the algorithm. I don't really understand it. Maybe you can explain it to me when you come back, but about the culture of Facebook.PERINO: Yeah, right.SHILLUE: I want to read you a quote from Jodi Seth, who is a spokesman for Facebook, and she said, ""When they hired Joel Kaplan,"" who was in the Bush administration, they said, ""we thought it was important to have a senior republican in the office to bring a conservative perspective to the table."" What does that tell you about the culture of Facebook that they had to go out and look for a conservative?PERINO: Well, you know, sometimes if you're in Silicon Valley you might not be able to find one, right?(LAUGHTER)PERINO: The conservative population here in Silicon Valley for the day. Joel Kaplan and I very good friends, we worked together at the Bush White House. I think he was an excellent choice. Again, his relationships, where he known Sheryl Sandberg when they were in college and he's been able to do a lot of good work there. Here's the thing that I'm gonna try to bring up today is that Silicon Valley does a very good job of champion -- being the champion of diversity. But when they think of diversity, I think they mostly think of gender and race. And that diversity of thought is also very valuable when it comes to growing a big company or to avoiding situations like the one that they're in now. So it's a first step and I will be back tomorrow to tell you all about it.BOLLING: All right. I cut you off. Are you through to your questions? Are you good?MCCAIN: Yeah. I just, you know, I hope this isn't a PR stunt on Mark Zuckerberg's part to stop the bleeding of this PR disaster, and I just look forward to hearing what Dana has to say tomorrow. And you're very brilliant and I trust you a lot more than I ever trusted him. Oh, she's gone.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Right. I see what I can do. And I don't know a lot about technology, but I'll see what I can find out. All I know is that I push buttons and things happen.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Now I have a chance to learn a little bit more about what happens behind that.BOLLING: All right. Dana, thank you very much. Have a great time.PERINO: Thanks guys.BOLLING: Best to everyone all the conservatives out there. And you guys did, you quadruple the conservative population of Menlo Park, California. We look forward to hearing how that meeting goes. Coming up, breaking Trump news, a major announcement from the presumptive GOP nominee today. That's coming up next on ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Big news from the Trump campaign today, the presumptive nominee listing 11 potential nominees for the Supreme Court if he wins the White House. They include conservative federal and state judges. Trump says the list, quote, ""representative of the kind of constitutional principles I value,"" end quote. Sean Hannity got the first interview with the candidate on the Supreme Court list and here's a clip.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN HANNITY, ""HANNITY"" HOST: You are a constitutionalist?DONALD TRUMP, GOP PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE: Correct, correct. And I'm also, I want high intellect. I want great intellect. These people are all very high intellect. They're pro-life and -- so that's my list.HANNITY: Yeah.TRUMP: And we're going to choose from most likely from this list. But at a minimum, we will keep people within this general realm. Again, I have a lot of people that are conservative that really like me, love everything I stand for, but they really would like to know my view, because perhaps outside of the defense of our country, perhaps the single most important thing the next president is going to have to do is pick supreme court justices.HANNITY: Who has --(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: The full interview airs tonight at 10:00 p.m. on the ""Hannity"" show. Don't miss it. So let me start with you, Jedediah.BILA: Yeah.WILLIAMS: It looks to me like most of these judges are anti-abortion. Is that, was that the test? Is that what he's trying to convey here?BILA: I think he wants constitutionalists. I think conservatives when they look at a presidential election one of the chief concern is the Supreme Court right now. We've seen ObamaCare mandates, we have freedom issues, so many issues wind up hitting the court and many conservatives feel like constitutional principles aren't upheld. So this is his moment to ensure conservatives that look, I've got your back, not only on a pro-life issue, but on all matters of the constitution. And it looks like he's going to pick someone who abides by the constitution, for which would be a welcome change --WILLIAMS: You know this is interesting to me, clearly, you know when I look at it I think he doesn't back Justice John Roberts, the chief justice on the ObamaCare mandate, for example right? He has trouble with Justice Roberts, but Justice Roberts is a conservative. The people that he's named like Pryor --BOLLING: Did you --(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Juan, when you said conservative John Roberts. Did you air quote that?WILLIAMS: No, you don't think Robert --BOLLING: Well, I think he kind of showed his true colors with the ObamaCare --WILLIAMS: Wow. I don't even know what to say.(CROSSTALK)BILA: You look surprised --WILLIAMS: I am surprised, because I don't think there's any doubt that John Roberts is a conservative.BOLLING: Well, I mean he --MCCAIN: Even I have my issues with John Roberts.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: But conservative in name only but, was it -- anyway, so this should assuage the concern of many conservative who said Donald Trump is not a true conservative, OK --WILLIAMS: Because?BOLLING: Because of the issues, because he goes where he is on the bathroom issue, because of where he is on different issues. OK, so he's not hard- line right conservative, but the 11 people he picked for the Supreme Court certainly are. I mean, six federal court of appeals judges .WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: . five state Supreme Court judges, all of whom are on record with opinion being very, very conservative.MCCAIN: Yeah.BOLLING: This is all good news. The Heritage Foundation said Donald Trump, a couple of weeks ago, maybe?WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.BOLLING: A couple of months ago perhaps, and said here's a list that we think would be good. Donald Trump, they gave him eight. Donald Trump put five of those eight on his list. So Heritage, a very conservative group says, we'd like this list as well. I think these are all, all very good things and this is great timing, because all the people who are concerned with Donald Trump can now realize that if you don't necessarily ascribe to everything he believes in, know that he's going to surround himself with very, very smart people.MCCAIN: I think also the concern is in this election obviously, if Hillary Clinton were to win, the type of people she would put on the Supreme Court. So even if you have your issues with Donald Trump, the idea they are not being a pro-life person taking over for Scalia is the kind of thing that just keeps me up at night and a lot of different ways. I think those of us that are still hesitant about Trump, these only shows that he's making an attempt. He's showing that he will put real conservatives on the Supreme Court. He's taking it seriously. All that being said was getting a lot of play on the internet, Justice Don Willett, who was one of the people that was put on this list, he's been trolling Trump on Twitter for a long time. So you know, just PR wise, I would love for them to put out a list of things and maybe let this guy know --WILLIAMS: Meghan, one question before I go on time .MCCAIN: Sure.WILLIAMS: . which is that, Merrick Garland who is President Obama's nominee to replace Justice Scalia is viewed as centrist. I mean someone who has been confirmed by republican and democrats in the past. But now, the supreme -- the republican's majority in the Senate is saying, we won't even consider him.MCCAIN: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Would you put these nominees in the same category as Merrick Garland?MCCAIN: This guy is -- yeah, Merrick Garland is super anti-Second Amendment and he's pro-choice, yeah. I put any of these people (inaudible).WILLIAMS: Oh, but that's it. That's it.MCCAIN: It's very --WILLIAMS: Guns and abortion --MCCAIN: It's the cornerstone --BILA: That's pretty important issues.(CROSSTALK)SHILLUE: Those are big ones.BILA: Those are pretty key issues.BOLLING: Oh, that will --MCCAIN: It's the cornerstone of my (inaudible).BOLLING: The Second Amendment?WILLIAMS: No, no, no. I'm just interested that there are litmus tests for conservatives.MCCAIN: Those are two.WILLIAMS: Their Intel, I guess Justice Roberts and others who are conservatives on court might not fit right now. Tom, am I wrong? What's going on?SHILLUE: Well, I want to know what you guys think of Trump's proposal that you have to take all 11 at once. What do you think of that?(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: I think FDR, FDR wanted to do something like this.(LAUGHTER)SHILLUE: I wouldn't surprise me.WILLIAMS: Yeah.SHILLUE: But yeah, it looks like a good list. They're very conservative. The interesting thing is conservatives often say there's no litmus test, but apparently there is with Trump. He said they're pro-life, that's -- he does have a litmus test.MCCAIN: That's a big one. I mean, especially for the Supreme Court.SHILLUE: Yeah, but I think it is -- I mean, I think this is a, this is Trump at his most conservative. I think conservatives are going to be happy with this one.BOLLING: The other interesting thing, one of the pushback on Trump was that, oh, his sister is a judge, right? And she's pro-choice.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: And so he said, uh-oh, Trump might put his sister on the Supreme Court, put her up for a nomination on the Supreme Court, and she's pro- choice. Notice Trump's sister is not on the list. Also not on the list, Mike Lee, senator who is rumored, hey, maybe he would be on this list. He's not, but his brother is on the list. And Ted Cruz, a lot of people say maybe Ted Cruz, a constitutional conservative will be -- I thought .MCCAIN: I would like that.BOLLING: . he would be. I would have like that.MCCAIN: Kind of like that, yeah.WILLIAMS: Oh yeah, I can just see it now, lyin' justice.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)SHILLUE: Nickname first then you can call him --WILLIAMS: The nickname.BOLLING: You can call him what you want .WILLIAMS: Oh, come on.BOLLING: . but he still is a constitutional conservative.WILLIAMS: OK. But here's what I noticed.BOLLING: So does he.WILLIAMS: I noticed that all of these judges are in support of more strict voter I.D. laws, abortion and I, you know, to me I'm just wondering, that's what it's all about, Jedediah?BILA: Well he said this is a guy who's for many have been on both sides of many issues. See, that's the struggle people have. They're trying to figure out what would Donald Trump actually do if he were elected president? So here, what he's saying to people is let me offer you some security. Regardless of what I've said in the past, what I want to do is abide by the constitution. So you're talking about, you know, you talk about guns, like it's the Second Amendment. So that, of course, that's important to him, he's going to, you know, take a look at the constitution, he's going to hire also the question is who would he hire? Who would he surround himself with? Well, he's telling you right now, these are the people that he would prioritize. So regardless, you can look at tapes from 15 years ago or 10 years ago, he's trying to offer conservatives some security as to what he would provide once he gets him to office, and I think this is a good start.BOLLING: I'm surprised at you.WILLIAMS: Why is that?BOLLING: Even liberals know enough not to go anti-Second Amendment when they're up for election. Even liberals know that.WILLIAMS: No, no. but I'm saying, you have justices here, and I thought the idea was we want conservatives, but we're not going to tell them. I mean, abortion, I agree, that tends to be a biggie, but beyond that you just want people who have experience, who have proven -- and I would think with Merrick Garland sitting there as a point of comparison, more centrist. Anyway, don't go away because up next, you're not going to believe what Trump, again, what he said about President Obama this time to Sean Hannity, that -- plus Trump's big interview with Megyn Kelly last night. The highlights when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BILA: More now from Sean Hannity's upcoming interview with Donald Trump tonight. President Obama has had plenty of things to say about the presumptive GOP nominee this campaign season. Tonight, Trump fires back. Take a look at a sneak peek.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: You want fair trade, you're not a protectionist. You want better deals.TRUMP: I want fair trade. The problem with fair trade the people we have now are incompetent. Our president is, you know, he used a word the other day, not a nice word, but he's an ignorant president. He's an ignorant president. He doesn't know what's going on, in my opinion, OK, and the opinion of plenty of other people.(END VIDEO CLIP)BILA: Uh-oh, fighting words, Juan. You want to defend your president against that?WILLIAMS: No. I mean that's, I think, you know, I think the president suggested that Trump's lack of knowledge equaled ignorance of foreign affairs, et cetera, and I think this is Trump paying that back. In fact, in the Megyn Kelly interview where Trump said whenever he feels injured he try, he doesn't do anything, he doesn't seek peace. He wants to fight back to uninjured himself as the way he put it, which I thought was pretty revealing and that's what this is.BILA: Eric, he often says too, you know, he doesn't make these attacks just out of the blue, that he's on defense. A lot of times somebody says something about him and he retaliates, and that's he's right to do it. How do you think this plays, though, in the media when he says things like this about President Obama?BOLLING: It plays well with the base, as the base is sick with Obama and they're tired of Obama. And I guess he's setting it up so that if Hillary wants -- and she's done this, run on Obama's legacy, she wants to be four more eight more years of Obama, he can set up the line. I think it's a waste of time for him, though.BILA: Yeah.BOLLING: He could have fluffed it off like, oh yeah, he's a lame duck, he's out of here, anyway. And that would have felt a little presidential to me like, I got this from you. I'll take this over. You can just hurry up and get out. Let me start measuring the curtains on 1600 Pennsylvania.(LAUGHTER)MCCAIN: Yeah.BOLLING: I think that would have been a little, but Donald Trump never backs down from a comment or a fight, and that's his stand.BILA: I want to shift over to the Megyn Kelly interview. I thought she did an amazing job. Trump gave some really interesting answers to questions. Let's take at this one and I want to get your comment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, ""THE KELLY FILE"" HOST: If you don't become president, will this all have been for nothing? Or will you have changed America?TRUMP: I will say this. If I don't go all the way and if I don't win, I will consider it to be a total and complete waste of time, energy and money.(END VIDEO CLIP)(LAUGHTER)BILA: See, Tom, I see you laughing. I actually disagree with him. I think he has completely changed the culture, the scene, he's proven that you don't have to have any love from the establishment and you can still win. I think he's done a lot whether he wins or not. What's your take?SHILLUE: It doesn't matter. And he does -- I love that answer and it's so refreshing. I mean, I think people respond today, look at them and say, that is the least politician-type answer anyone would ever say. I mean, the people always say, oh, we're meeting wonderful people. We're making changes and everything like that. And he says no. If I don't win, it's a waste. And I think he said money too. He said it's a waste of time, and energy, and money. It's like that's the way he thinks, but if you don't win, it's nothing.BILA: All right.SHILLUE: And it's like, I think people feel that way. Remember when Mitt Romney lost? People were just crushed, and then you know, Mitt Romney says, well -- you know, he came out and he gave that -- I never loved that speech that people give and they say, ""We worked so hard, and, you know, the president is going to do a good job."" I wish the candidate would come out and say, ""What, are you people dumb? You didn't elect me? What is wrong with you?"" Because that's what they're thinking.MCCAIN: I just think with all due respect, you've never been on the campaign trail for two years, my father lost spectacularly. I wouldn't take back one minute. The most liberating experience of my life. I know he agrees.And I know Donald Trump's tone is incredibly different, but running for president is a privilege. That's actually the one answer I really didn't like last night.SHILLUE: Wouldn't -- didn't you want to say, ""Are you people stupid for not electing my dad""?MCCAIN: No. No.SHILLUE: You didn't.MCCAIN: I think that's highly disrespectful, actually. And I actually think that Obama -- no, I don't. Because I think you have to listen to the will of the American people in the same way that the Republican Party has to listen to Donald Trump supporters right now. What America wants, America wants.And I also think the moment that I liked in the interview last night was him actually copping to, maybe not regretting -- I wouldn't push it that far -- but saying he could have lived without the Heidi Cruz tweets. Because that was one of the things, above all else, that I had such a problem with, and I think many women did. Even just recognizing that it may have been a mistake, I think is a bold move for Donald Trump at this point.BILA: You know, I think Megyn struck a really great tone. And I think she brought out something...BOLLING: McCain?BILA: Meghan McCain, as well.MCCAIN: Confusing.BILA: But I think it brought out some humility in the guy. And I think when you look at Donald Trump oftentimes, you see someone who isn't going to say things like ""I had regrets"" or who isn't going to take things back or potentially say -- there was a softer side to him that I think would appeal to a lot of people who just look at his Twitter feed and just see these -- the bombast.I don't know, Eric. What do you think? I think that interview serves him quite well to appeal to a broader section of the public.BOLLING: OK.BILA: No? You disagree?BOLLING: It was out of character for me. I watched it, and I thought this isn't the Donald Trump I'm used to watching. And I frankly like the one -- not that one. I like the one where he does go at you and you...WILLIAMS: And that's what he said. He said that, in fact, if he wasn't the kind of bombastic, aggressive character, he doesn't think that he would have been -- if he's talking policy and he's talking position, he thinks he wouldn't be...BOLLING: He's not going to have 28,000 people in Mississippi if he's talking policy.But guys, one thing. I agree with you. I don't even think -- I'm not even sure Donald Trump realizes how much change he's created in the American political spectrum right now.WILLIAMS: Yes. He broke the Republican Party.BOLLING: Right. And it was time to be broken.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know about that.BOLLING: And it was right to be broken.WILLIAMS: I have more respect -- I have more respect for the Republican Party than you do.BOLLING: Donald Trump created a hostile takeover of the Republican Party. But again, in business you know this: you can't just take a company unless they're ripe for the taking. If they're not performing well, they can fight off a hostile takeover. The Republican GOP establishment couldn't fight it off, because it was broken.MCCAIN: The question is, as you said you didn't respond to that interview. I did a little more. Is he pivoting? You have two women here saying we responded. It will be interesting if he continues that tone going forward to try and reach out to a different audience.BILA: I think he's trying to get these voters that weren't so convinced before. He's got your vote, Eric. He's worried about us.All right. Catch the big interview with Trump tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern on ""Hannity.""Up next, another win for Bernie Sanders means another loss for Hillary Clinton. Uh-oh. The Democratic race developments when ""The Five"" returns. Coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MCCAIN: It was another big night for Bernie Sanders. He won Oregon's primary and nearly defeated Hillary Clinton in Kentucky. Clinton is claiming victory there and now just 92 delegates shy of clinching the nomination. Bernie is still vowing to stay until the end, however.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are a lot of people out there, many of the pundits and politicians, they say, ""Bernie Sanders should drop out."" Let me be as clear as I can be. I agree with you. We are in till the last ballot is cast.The Democratic Party is going to have to make a very, very profound and important decision. It can do the right thing and open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCCAIN: Sanders has even just agreed to do a FOX News debate out in California, putting the onus now on Hillary Clinton to accept the invitation, as well. I think there's no chance she'll ever do it. What do you think, Jedediah?BILA: Yes. I think Bernie Sanders isn't afraid of tough questions. I think that's because he actually stands for something, and he doesn't actually have to be worried about. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is another story. I don't think she'll ever do it.I reached out on Twitter, though -- it was interesting -- to Sanders supporters, and I said, ""If you're a Sanders supporter and you could never vote for Hillary, tell me why.""And the words that I got back were, ""She's corrupt. She's dishonest. She's a liar. She's a crook. She's a one-woman war on woman.""One tweet was amazing to me, because it perfectly defined what I would have said, but it came from a liberal. And I think the account is ""IWeepforTrees."" ""She's not a Democrat, not a Republican, not a socialist. She's a Clintonite. It's all about her profit and power.""And I think that's why he needs to stay in, because I don't think that these voters that love him are automatically going to go to her. And I think for the left, if I were on a left, I would want a champion of what I actually stood for, and I think that he's the guy.She stands for nothing. I think she's just a corrupt politician.WILLIAMS: Meghan, can I hijack your segment just for a second and ask you a question. Why do you and why does Jedediah say that Hillary Clinton won't do this debate?MCCAIN: Because I think she just wants to get -- become the nominee and debate Donald Trump. And I think she wants to put it behind.But she's becoming a weaker candidate day by day. Bernie Sanders supporters, if you think they aren't crazy, go listen to the voice mails they left on the Nevada chair's voice mail. It is crazy. Don't ever say anything about Trump supporters. Listen to Bernie Sanders supporters.And I agree with you, Jedediah: there's so many millennial women especially who I think are going to go to Trump, because they're so angry at Hillary Clinton right now.WILLIAMS: Well, this is -- I think you're being wishful.BOLLING: Can I give you an alternative or give you a reason?WILLIAMS: Yes, go right ahead. BOLLING: Bottom of the ninth. There are two outs.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: You're up by seven. Why are you playing -- why are you playing games? Just throw the ball, finish the game. There's no reason to take a chance on a debate.WILLIAMS: Wait, wait. And you're saying -- you're saying throwing the ball is no debate?BOLLING: Well, she wins in in Puerto Rico. She doesn't have to wait until California. She wins in Puerto Rico. Unless she says something wild in the debate.WILLIAMS: Obviously, I am out of time. Tom, we haven't heard from you. Do you agree with these people?SHILLUE: I agree with Eric completely. There's no upside for Hillary. She can just hide. She can hide from the debate. She's going to get the nomination.WILLIAMS: OK. OK. So here's the -- here's the outlier point of view.BILA: What's that?WILLIAMS: Which is -- just because of what you said, what's been going on in Nevada, the fact that the Democratic establishment has been saying to Bernie Sanders, ""Be a man. Stand up. You cannot have people threatening the Nevada Democratic chair, calling names, throwing tables and all the rest,"" there is a need for Hillary Clinton to speak to Bernie Sanders supporters and to treat Bernie Sanders with respect. And that's why she needs to do this FOX debate. In addition to which, she will reach an audience she has not reached before, often an audience of independent women.BOLLING: Let me jump on that, also. Hey, Hillary, you want to be president of the United States? You know who would not back down from a debate like this? Donald Trump wouldn't back down from a debate like this. Why don't you show them and America what you got? Go debate Bernie Sanders. What have you got to lose?WILLIAMS: That's what I'm saying.BILA: The problem is she's still her. I don't know if you've paid any attention to her, but she's terrible at this.WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. Wait a minute.BILA: She is awful at this. That's the second problem.WILLIAMS: Hold on. Let me answer your first -- your first issue.BILA: She's terrible.WILLIAMS: She's beat Bernie Sanders in every debate and gotten, I think, three million more votes than Bernie Sanders.BILA: This guy, he's how old? He's a walking cartoon, and he's giving her a run for her money here.MCCAIN: Also she's beating him fair and square. I'm so sick of this Roswell landing conspiracy that Bernie Sanders is hijacking everything. She has, like, 3.6 million more votes than he does. And they're just not going to put it past her.Right now he's running to be socialist folk hero of America. And as much as I would love to see them come out and debate, he's no longer doing this because he wants to be the nominee. He just wants to continue making this political statement and doing God knows what.WILLIAMS: You know, you're hurting Eric's feelings. I just want you to know, it's not nice. Eric is a big Bernie Sanders supporter. Because anything that's not Hillary, he likes.BOLLING: It would be -- it would behoove her to show up to a debate.WILLIAMS: I think so. We agree.BOLLING: Especially when the challenger says, ""I'll do this. We can do this."" And work out...WILLIAMS: And show -- and show -- just show enough respect, but show that, you know, you're not afraid of this.BILA: Yes.WILLIAMS: I think it's in your interest, Mrs. Clinton. John Podesta, it's in your campaign's interest, going forward against Trump, to have the Sanders people say, ""She treated us with respect until the very end.""SHILLUE: A good sales pitch.MCCAIN: I think she should do it, too, but she know that Bret Baier ain't Rachel Maddow, honey. She's going to have to answer some real questions, and a lot of times, she gets a lot of passes from the media. Just saying.BILA: I think she is tough, too. And I think that it would be making -- for the people that really support her and really believe in her, this will be a great opportunity for her to kind of -- it would be. But I want you, I don't have quite the confidence in her that you do, Juan, I'm sorry to say.MCCAIN: All right. Next, the whisper -- the whisper revealed more than 20 years later. What O.J. Simpson told his lawyer, Robert Shapiro, right after a jury cleared him of a double murder, coming up on ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SHILLUE: It was the whisper seen around the world. When O.J. Simpson was acquitted of double murder in 1995, he leaned over to one of his lawyers, Robert Shapiro, to tell him something in private. It's remained secret for more than two decades, until last night when Shapiro revealed O.J.'s words on ""Megyn Kelly Presents.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Moments after the verdict, O.J. Simpson leaned over and whispered something in your ear. What did he say?ROBERT SHAPIRO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: ""You had told me this would be the result from the beginning. You were right.""(END VIDEO CLIP)SHILLUE: The glove that didn't fit is what may have led to the acquittal. Here's what Shapiro told Megyn about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHAPIRO: I tried the glove on. It was a little bit wide in my palm and a little bit long in my fingers. O.J. Simpson has enormous hands, and I knew that that glove would not fit him.KELLY: Really?SHAPIRO: Wouldn't even be close. Here's what I told O.J. Simpson: ""I want you to walk as close to the jury as you can. Hold up your hand like you're holding the Olympic torch, and pull and tug on that glove."" Because it will not fit. And clearly, it didn't.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHILLUE: Wow. First of all, Eric, was Shapiro paid $1 million for his services? You get that?BOLLING: No.SHILLUE: He looks like Dr. Evil.No, I want to ask you, Eric, why are we still -- we're talking about gloves and hand size a lot this year, aren't we?BOLLING: What a fail on the prosecution's part. I mean, Chris Darden was one of the prosecutors, right? Marcia Clark. They didn't know O.J. has massive hands? Anyone knows, a football player his size, he has massive hands. You try the glove on before you rest your whole case on the one glove. And by the way, when you have a rubber glove on underneath, that adds to the difficulty of putting on the glove.Everyone knew that. I remember this case. You remember this?SHILLUE: Yes.BOLLING: Everyone knew that wasn't going to fit. But can you imagine that they let it all hang on the glove?SHILLUE: But Juan...WILLIAMS: Jedediah and I are too young to remember this case. But I did see the special.But the thing that stunned me that Shapiro said to Megyn Kelly was he believes that the prosecution failed to understand the evidence, and it's likely there were two people involved. But he never says, ""Well, so who killed Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend?""I don't know -- I mean, to me, is this guy in denial? What's he up to?SHILLUE: Well, I mean, he said it was his job to get him off. He didn't - - he didn't say he was innocent, right?WILLIAMS: Yes. He apparently thinks there were two people. Or maybe he thinks O.J. and another person did it?SHILLUE: I mean, be serious.Jedediah, do you remember this case? Did your kindergarten teacher stop the class so that you could watch the verdict?BILA: I remember watching the chase. We were all huddled in my parents' bedroom. And I remember that it was a moment I was never going to forget. I look at it now, and it makes me want to star in a courtroom drama, be an actor and do something like this.But it's so fascinating to me the way these -- these cases sort of overtake the culture. And the way you never forget them.SHILLUE: Well, what ever -- this would be one, I mean.BILA: It sort of paved the way for -- I mean, my mom is very into this stuff. She's probably watching at home right now and can name 500 of them. But you know, JonBenet Ramsey. Or whatever the case may be.BOLLING: Casey Anthony.BILA: Casey Anthony, yes. It mesmerizes us. And we sort of forget sometime that it's real life. You get -- you get captivated by it, and you forget that these are real lives at stake. So it's an interesting phenomenon.SHILLUE: Absolutely.MCCAIN: It's so fascinating, though. That FX show was huge about O.J. Simpson that came out a few months ago. I mean, everyone I know was watching it.I think it's -- honestly, I think, part of it is because of the Kardashians are so popular. And there's, like, now a current reference to an old reference. And it's the trial that changed everything. Because like you said, Jedediah, then Court TV came and every trial since, Nancy Grace has - - makes a living and, you know, people are still endlessly fascinated.SHILLUE: But do we have a shot of him putting those gloves on? We had the still of him with the gloves. I mean, you look at -- they're that that small, are they? I mean -- you can still kill someone with gloves like that, you cannot?MCCAIN: He's guilty; he killed her. I mean, you know, it's just -- right now it's amazing that they're able to get him off.BILA: That's actually a great point, though. Like because the glove didn't fit perfectly, he wasn't able to commit a crime? I see what you're saying. If you use common sense for a second, you can have an ill-fitting glove and still commit a crime. I see where you're going for this.SHILLUE: It didn't have to be his gloves. I mean, when you're going to murder someone, you grab any gloves, don't you?BILA: Well played. You should have been a lawyer.They needed you in the courtroom, Shillue.WILLIAMS: I want to go visit Shillue when they -- when they take him to jail, since he's telling me he's putting on gloves before he kills people.BILA: Oh, boy.SHILLUE: Meghan said it was the Kardashians and, you know, the spectacle of the trial. But really, wasn't it about race? Wasn't race the issue?BOLLING: I feel bad for O.J. Yes, remember after the trial he said he would not rest until he found Nicole Brown's killer.WILLIAMS: You say to yourself...BOLLING: Twenty-five years later, he still hasn't...SHILLUE: How many golf courses did he search? Right? OK. ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Time for ""One More Thing"" -- Juan.WILLIAMS: Well, I have a story of modern love, but sadly, it ends in divorce. After a wedding, a husband and wife returned to their hotel room, but the wife will not get off her cell phone. She's texting with friends. And the groom becomes frustrated and says, ""Who's more important to you? Your friends and that texting or me?""She said, ""I'm going to finish my texting."" Well, he got hot, and pretty soon they were arguing. And minutes after the wedding, he filed for divorce.BILA: I love it!WILLIAMS: Divorce. You like this story?BILA: That's me, I'm Italian. We get excited.BOLLING: You got that she liked her friends more than him?WILLIAMS: The texting, Eric, you would put up with this?BOLLING: I wouldn't have married her, if that was the deal, in the first place.BILA: That was beautifully said, by the way. You should be a narrator.BOLLING: Especially a guy who's spending so much time in weddings recently.WILLIAMS: Yes, but I hope that nobody in my family would do that.BOLLING: Right. All right. So something really, really crazy happened today. I'm just -- I'm blown away about this. So you know, I wrote a book, ""Wake Up, America."" It comes out June 28. Barnes & Noble on their top 100 bestsellers, today, it ended up No. 9. It's not even out yet. It's No. 9 of all bestsellers. If you go to the politics -- click on the politics books, it's No. 1 in politics. It hasn't even gone on sale yet.SHILLUE: Presale.WILLIAMS: That's unbelievable.BOLLING: I'm just absolutely blown away. I want to say thank you. You can order the book down there at BarnesandNoble.com.WILLIAMS: Congratulations.BOLLING: And wow, just so fantastic. I was so proud of that.BILA: I didn't get my copy yet. It's not out for another...WILLIAMS: It's not out yet.BILA: Still, I like to get the advance, you know, pre-edit.BOLLING: Do we see if we can get up the -- J.K. Rowling is No. 1. I want to see if we can get close to her.Tom, you're up.SHILLUE: OK. ""Red Eye"" has the best fans. I call them my Shilluenatics.BILA: Yes.SHILLUE: They text me in the middle of the night. Taft (ph), the resident artist draws ""Red Eye"" every night live and yesterday drew ""The Five."" Do we have that picture? That's us, last night at midnight. You can see me there with the -- look at Jedediah.BOLLING: Am I the dark one in the back?WILLIAMS: Yes, that's you.SHILLUE: Look...MCCAIN: Look at your cheekbones.SHILLUE: My cheekbones are always there. It's always two cheekbones.Look at Eric, though. Eric, you look angry.BOLLING: I look scary.MCCAIN: Didn't mean to ruin that for you.BOLLING: You're up. Jedediah.BILA: OK. So this story combines my two favorite things in the world, pets and firemen. I love that Meghan caught that right away.So Houston Fire Department rescued two pets. There was a big fire. Listen to this: there was a little dog hiding inside of a wall, and then they found a cat that had gone inside of a mattress and hidden. Look at what these guys did. And amazing. They washed them off. They carried the dog. They gave the dog oxygen. They gave the cat oxygen.I mean, these -- this is why I love them. Because it's not only that they save people. But they save pets. And everyone knows that, if I could, I would have a giant farm. This is a feel-good story for everybody at home.SHILLUE: You love firemen, don't you?BILA: I do.BOLLING: Meghan.BOLLING: Juan, you were a fireman before you were a journalist, weren't you? Just work with me. Say yes.MCCAIN: All right. My ""One More Thing"" yesterday was my parents' 36th wedding anniversary.BILA: Yay. Look at that.MCCAIN: I just -- I love my parents obviously. Thanks for falling in love and having me and, you know, showing me what a great marriage is through, you know, a lot of crazy things in their life. So I'm very happy. I just want to give them a shout-out on ""The Five."" My mom is very excited.BOLLING: We should all shout out at the McCains, congratulations. Thirty- sixth?MCCAIN: Thirty-sixth, yes.BILA: You look just like your mom.MCCAIN: Oh, thank you.BILA: Amazing.MCCAIN: My mom is so hot and she was like when she was younger, though. She got married when my mom was 24, and my dad was, like, 58. Not really. He was, like, 40. There's a 20-year age gap. And I'm, like Mom was really hot.BOLLING: How long have you guys been married?WILLIAMS: I've been married about 38 years on July 1.SHILLUE: Thirteen, 13 years.BOLLING: Eighteen years for me.BILA: Wow.

4	4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/07/15/bolton-if-coup-in-turkey-fails-expect-brutal-crackdown/	Bolton: If coup in Turkey fails, expect brutal crackdown	"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" July 15, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton joins us.Good evening, Ambassador.As you look at these pictures and see what's going on in Turkey, your thoughts?JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Well, I think we really don't have any good idea what the disposition of the Turkish military is. We know the coup originated with some in the military. The senior officers, many who have been put in place in the past several years by Erdogan obviously are part of the problem from the perspective of those carrying out the coup.So, there is no doubt this is not run from the very top of the military, but it's kind of a last ditch effort by those who still adhered to the vision of Mustafa Kemal to have a secular constitution, secular society,(inaudible) in Western government. The constitution itself gives the military the duty of maintaining the secular nature of the state which Erdogan has been doing everything he can to overturn.So, I think it remains very much up in the air. I don't think these television pictures tell us very much. You are hearing competing press statements. But I think the future of Turkey is obviously at stake. If the coup succeeds then I think Erdogan effort to perhaps recreate the Ottoman caliphate, perhaps to be the dominant power again in the Middle East and second to move Turkey in Islamic direction will be foiled if Erdogan prevails. I think you would see an acceleration of the Islamization effort to make.VAN SUSTEREN: But, it puts United States in an awkward position. We support elective government, we do not support coups. Yet the way that you describe it is that given the choice that seems that we would, the United States would prefer it with move toward less toward Islamic government and towards a more secular one.BOLTON: Well, I think the president's statement just a few minutes ago seems to indicate is he backing Erdogan the same way for a good long time they backed Mohammed Morsi in Egypt. I think it is not a question of elected governments versus military governments at least in the case of Turkey. Is the question of the constitution which Erdogan has been doing his best to sub verdict.Not only that, he has been trying to get his supporters, Islamists in the top jobs of the military. He has been systematically packing the judiciary to that effect as well. So that is why I think this is, really is kind a last stand by the seculars who are still in the army.And that may bode poorly for their chance of success. But on the other hand, as I say, at least on a public level, I don't think we have now any estimate of how much of the military backs the coup and how much of the military and the police oppose the coup.VAN SUSTEREN: Should we be worried? Does this impact us here in the United States? I mean, as Americans are watching us across the country and looking at these pictures and trying to figure out who is doing, what how does it impact Americans?BOLTON: Well, if Turkey goes in the direction that Erdogan wants, toward more an Islamist state, I think that increasing radicalization just contributes to the growing chaos across the region, if the military wins it's still going to be difficult.But, you know, Erdogan once said when he was Mayor of Istanbul and I think this is in the minds of a lot of Turkish citizens, civilians and military. Erdogan once said democracy is like a streetcar you ride it to the stop you wanted and then you get off. So, it may sound ironic but the defender of not only the secular state but the possibility of democracy into the future here could well be the military against this kind of authoritarian internal coupe by somebody like Erdogan.VAN SUSTEREN: But Erdogan is someone we know. Is someone we have worked with for a while.(CROSSTALK)BOLTON: Well, I must say, I don't agree with that.I don't agree with that he was ahead of the AKP party, back in 2003 when the United States sought permission from the government of Turkey.VAN SUSTEREN: He said no.BOLTON: To bring in the fourth division, fourth infantry division across the Turkish border into Iraq and we couldn't get the votes. And Erdogan said, oh well, you know I did my best and so on and so forth. I have always believed he sabotaged our efforts back then.So I have nothing. I have no charity in my heart for Erdogan. If he goes down I'm not shedding any tears. I don't think he has been a friend to the United States.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, I don't know, I didn't mean to say as a friend but he is someone we know, who we work with. I mean, we at least know him in that way. It's someone we have -- whether he has been cooperative or not, at least it's a known entity. If the military is successful in this coup, who does emerge as the one in charge? And what's the certainty there for us?BOLTON: Well, I don't think we know. But we know Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping well too, I mean, that to me is not evidence in support of their remaining in power, necessarily I think there could be confusion if the military prevails. Likely are people at the lower general grade level who are doing this, because they are the last ones that haven't been purged.So, therefore, the question of the loyalty of all of the various military units around the country remains to be determined. And at this point, you know, the journalists are most mostly sitting in Istanbul in Ankara and I don't think have any real way of knowing what the sentiment of the troops is throughout the country.VAN SUSTEREN: What do you think German Chancellor Angela Merkel is thinking tonight as she looks at this?BOLTON: Well, she has made a mess of this whole refugee situation in Europe. I have a lot of respect for Merkel but this has been a debacle. And I think the Erdogan government facilitated the movement of those hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of refugees out of Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.So if anything I think the restoration of a secular government here is more likely to stem the refugee flow. I think the military is more likely to say we have got to get control of this situation.VAN SUSTEREN: It's being reported right now that the -- at least being reported in Turkey that the coup attempt has been repelled, that sounds like, it might be -that the Erdogan has regained control.BOLTON: Well, it is certainly possible. As I say at this point we have got a lot of competing press releases and we will see what happens as the evening goes on. It is just very difficult to tell from a distance.VAN SUSTEREN: There also were some flashes and explosions but I don't know what that was. We saw pictures of that. I can't, you know, I don't know what they are. I just noticed them in the background as we look at these pictures.What about in terms of, I asked you about German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Impact on Western Europe is what? I mean as we watch and try to figure out what's going on whether Erdogan has taken complete power back or not. But give me your thoughts on the impact on Western Europe.BOLTON: Well, I think Turkey was never likely to succeed in its application for membership in the E.U. This will probably seal its fate for those who would use the coup as an excuse. But, honestly if Erdogan has succeeded here as that report indicates, I think you are going to see very, very extensive repression.I think the military will be purged once and for all. I think the courts will be purged, and I think there is going to be a real authoritarian crack down. This is the moment, if the coup has failed as I said several times earlier, I think it was a last ditch effort, and it's failed. If it has failed, then I think there are no checks and balances left against Erdogan really turning Turkey in a very Islamist direction and a very authoritarian direction under his presidency.VAN SUSTEREN: We're learning also that air traffic in -- out of Europe is saying that they are expecting or hoping that the international departures at the Istanbul airport will be beginning soon again. So that also may be a sign that the coup is over. You know, I read about Erdogan and his takeover of what once was a thriving media and as I look at this tonight. My guess is, my thoughts like yours, ambassador, is if he has won, he is really going to crack down on these people who rose up against him.BOLTON: I don't think there is any doubt about it as I say that is not to repeat this but seems to me such an insight into Erdogan thinking when he said democracies like a streetcar you ride it to the stop you want and then you get off. I think you have got to stop. I think he is going to get off if he has in fact prevailed here.VAN SUSTEREN: I asked you about Western Europe and about Angela Merkel. What's Putin's thinking tonight as he watched this?BOLTON: Well, I think this has been a complicated relationship and I think he believed that Erdogan moving in this Islamist direction was really more likely to pose a threat to Russia. And in a way having the military in power would -- they would find -- it would be easier to find a Modus Operandi at least with respect to some of the issues. But, I think Putin, who has a very aggressive instinct will see the current instability in Turkey as an opportunity for him to expand Russian influence.So, if it's a circumstance where the struggle for control with the government is not over right now but continues for days or weeks, I think this from Putin's point of view is a way to try to stabilize the Assad regime in Syria, which would be its number one priority. Do what they can to finish off the Syrian opposition, because the Turks will be otherwise occupied. And there are a lot of possibilities here for Putin and the Black Sea. So, I expect Russia will be very, very assertive and aggressive as long as this uncertainty prevails.VAN SUSTEREN: You know, the pictures that we are looking at, we believe is Istanbul airport it seems like people are, you know, pouring in or crowding, going into it. I can't make much of it, but certainly a lot of people in the airport. Almost looks like O'Hare airport on a Friday night, awful lot of people there.BOLTON: And it's the middle of the night there too. Remember that.VAN SUSTEREN: And that is right. But they have got martial law declared, too. Erdogan, if he has maintained control, what happens to our war on ISIS? It just proceeds as is? I mean, is he not going to change up any agreements with those bases with us or his lack of or any cooperation he does give us?BOLTON: Well, I think it's too soon to tell. I mean, I think, Erdogan brought a lot of problem to himself, by his opposition to Assad. He thought Assad would fall and the Syrian opposition would sweep in fairly quickly. But, in fact, the chaos that has descended on Syria really gave ISIS the opportunity they needed. So, the Turkish aggression, assertiveness against Assad has back fired on him in a sense.And I think Erdogan and the military both for that matter are worried about the spread of Kurdish control in northern Syria and in parts of Turkey where linked up with Kurdistan and Iraq, this really poses a mortal threat to the territorial integrity of Turkey as we know it and that is something that Erdogan has been -- that is another blow back from his opposition to Assad that I don't think he counted on.VAN SUSTEREN: I don't know if you could read the lower third of the screen, but the state media is reporting that a bomb has hit the Turkish parliament, that can't be good news. Although, you know, it may be that, you know, and this is just my speculation, is that the Kurdish Separatist, who had been battling Erdogan for so long and enough. And others before him, maybe this is a time for them to make a greater move.BOLTON: Well, I think that is exactly right. Look, in the spreading chaos here. This is an opening for the Kurds as well, so there are a lot of scores to be settled around Turkish politics. I just think we need to know more here. Where is Erdogan, for example, he was apparently out of the country. Has he made it back in? He was trying to get into Ankara, in Istanbul. Where is he exactly? He has to be in control of the country, if you can't land in it, but still fundamentally, I think we need to know what the disposition of the military forces is, if the military can hold together, there may yet be a chance for the coup to succeed. It's just at this point we got fragments of information very hard to make real judgment.VAN SUSTEREN: All we know that this martial law that Erdogan at least, we don't know where he is, that he has appeared on TV using face time to CNN Turk and it's a very curious what is going on. But the pictures are distressing. Anyway, Ambassador Bolton, thank you for joining us.BOLTON: Glad to do it. Thanks for having me."	['Black']	[]

"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine...East vs. WestThe Cold War -- over fast food.The battle continues between Russia and McDonalds.The Russian government has closed a fourth branch of the American fast-food giant just in the last week -- all being cited for possible breaches in sanitary rules.The American Chamber of Commerce in Russia -- is not buying it.Quote-- ""Obviously-- it's driven by the political issues surrounding Ukraine. Is this going to be a knock on the door -- or is this going to be the beginning of a campaign?""Earlier this month Russia banned many imports from the U.S. and the European Union -- as retaliation for sanctions imposed over the Ukraine crisis.The Deputy Prime Minister tells Russian media--  no one is talking about banning McDonalds.Bacon-Wrapped ControversyBacon-- breakfast staple -- friend to lettuce and tomato -- and an offensive word that caused one small restaurant in Vermont-- to take down an advertisement.This is Sneaker's Bistro's - 'yield for bacon' sign. Seems innocent -- but the word bacon rubbed one resident the wrong way. She is Muslim and said it is offensive to those who do not eat pork.So the Bistro owners removed it saying -- ""We are here to serve people breakfast, not politics. We removed the sign that was located on public property as a gesture of respect for our diverse community. We still love bacon.""Some are calling it political correctness run amok. One resident told a local TV station -- ""I'm pretty sure the First Amendment extends to bacon and the selling of it.""Monkey BusinessFinally - a copyright battle for the modern age.Over this selfie -- taken by-- obviously- a monkey. Photographer David Slater -- claims he owns the image because he set up the shot-- using his own camera.The monkey just pushed the button. But others claim that since Slater did not take the photo -- he holds no rights to it.Cue the U.S. Copyright Office --which stated, quote--""The Office will not register works produced by nature-- animals-- or plants.""It gives as an example-- a photograph taken by a monkey.And yes-- the document was updated earlier this month."

"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" September 22, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Stossel Matters Segment"" tonight, as we analyze last night this whole Muslim controversy regarding Dr. Ben Carson is a trumped-up deal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: My take is this. If Dr. Carson doesn't want to vote for a president if the guy is Muslim or a woman is Muslim -- that's his opinion. That's his opinion. Under the constitution, any religion can become president.But he believes I think that it doesn't line up, a country founded on Judeo-Christian philosophy.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: So there.We wanted to know what the folks think. So John Stossel took to the streets.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN STOSSEL, FBN HOST: Would you be ok if a Muslim were president?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think I would be ok with that, yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it would cause too much divisiveness across the country.STOSSEL: Would it be ok with you if a Muslim were president?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I don't see a problem with that everyone is human.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I kind of disagree.STOSSEL: Would you vote for a Muslim for president?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.STOSSEL: No hesitation?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No hesitation. Just do my country right.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With our war against Islam at this point because I really unfortunately think that's what it is, I wouldn't. Because I don't think I would trust the integrity in the White House defending a country that's so near and dear to me.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Here now is Stossel. Do you think that Carson saying what he said, that he wouldn't support a Muslim running for president is offensive?STOSSEL: Well, part of it was offensive to me. But not the part you are thinking about.O'REILLY: What was offensive to you?STOSSEL: The way he said I would not advocate we put that person in charge of the nation. And politicians should know that the President is not in charge of the nation. He is in charge of the government and we're in charge of the nation.O'REILLY: You are parsing just as --STOSSEL: No, that's important. The President doesn't run the country.O'REILLY: Look, I know Carson pretty well.STOSSEL: His statement was reasonable and especially what he said later. If they follow the constitution -- fine.O'REILLY: He just objects as an American citizen. He doesn't think that Islam lines up with Judeo-Christian philosophy. And, therefore, if the nation's leader were a follower of the Koran, that a lot of things that he doesn't feel are good for the country might occur. That's a valid opinion. I mean it's the same thing --STOSSEL: Sure.It's the same thing as saying do you want a socialist? Do you want Bernie Sanders?STOSSEL: No.O'REILLY: Right. I don't want Bernie. Bernie is a fun guy. I mean I would like to go fishing with him if he would shut up. But I'm not going to vote for a socialist. I'm not voting for a socialist.STOSSEL: There is a difference. A socialist has certain governing beliefs. Your religion is presumably not about how you would govern the country.O'REILLY: But if you look at Islam the politics and the religion are always intertwined. In every single Muslim nation their laws are based on the Koran, you know that -- every one.STOSSEL: That's true. But you all week have been on a million TV programs saying Judeo-Christian country.O'REILLY: Philosophy.STOSSEL: Philosophy. What do you mean by that?O'REILLY: I mean that the founders of the constitution, the people who forged the country, all right, believed in the Ten Commandments and that's what they based the law on. Ok.There is no doubt about that they say it in their letters -- Madison, Jefferson, Franklin. They may not have been religious men. They may not have been. But they believed in the Ten Commandments as the litmus test of what is right and what is wrong. And they also believed that freedom was a gift from God.In the Muslim nations, many of them, there is no freedom s So that you have to put all of that and form your opinion. Now, would I vote for a Muslim president? If the guy was a super problem solver who was a secular Muslim, I might consider it, ok?STOSSEL: I would.O'REILLY: I might consider it I probably wouldn't but I might consider it. But I don't hold it against Carson for his opinion. The media a bunch of idiots -- he's prejudiced against them.STOSSEL: The media is looking to pick on any Republican that they can. They hate Republicans.O'REILLY: That's right. Questions are loaded and as I said the other night when a Republican contender is asked a loaded question about religion or about anything, do not answer. Just smile and say you know what, our foreign policy is a shambles.STOSSEL: And Krauthammer, clean your clock because you can't dodge the question like that.O'REILLY: Sure you can. You can absolutely dodge.STOSSEL: I just wanted to add, I asked 25 people. I thought most would have an objection. And your editor split it 50/50. But almost everyone just said no, no problem, without hesitation.O'REILLY: Ok. This is New York City. If you go down to Mobile, Alabama you will find a little bit of a different --STOSSEL: Probably.O'REILLY: All right. All right.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: And breaking tonight, three former Trump rivals take the stage this hour at the Republican National Convention to talk about their party, its candidate, and the future of the country.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly on a very busy night here in Cleveland. Before Governor Mike Pence takes the stage for the very first time as Donald Trump's running mate, we will hear from no less than three of Mr. Trump's former primary rivals. And some might even say, potential future rivals. Should Mr. Trump win it all in November?We're talking about Governor Scott Walker, Senator Marco Rubio, and Senator Ted Cruz, who interestingly he held a campaign-style event right here in Cleveland earlier today. And in a moment that can only be described as surreal or one you just cannot make up, Senator Cruz's rally was literally overshadowed by Donald Trump's plane. At the exact moment Senator Cruz discussed how he fell just short of winning the nomination and just watch the crowd's reaction upon seeing air Trump fly by. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: Our party now has a nominee. And I don't know - -(CROWD BOOING)All right. That was pretty well orchestrated! Jeff, did you e-mail them to fly the plane right when I said that?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Can you believe that? In moments, we'll get reaction from the Trump campaign. But first, we begin with ""America's Newsroom"" co-anchor, Bill Hemmer, live on the convention floor. Bill?BILL HEMMER, CO-ANCHOR, ""AMERICA'S NEWSROOM"": Megyn, good evening. I've been with the Texas delegation the last two hours, all 155 of them. One outstanding question tonight. Will Ted Cruz, more than two months after dropping out of this race, endorse Donald Trump? We don't know that answer right now. Many in the delegation hope he will. Many in the delegation want him to. Some others express the fact that they believe he should stand by his principles. One woman told me that he signed a pledge 11 months ago here in Cleveland, Ohio, and he has to stick to his word.The Attorney General Ken Paxton, leads this delegation. I spoke to him a moment ago. He says he doesn't know what Cruz will do. It's a 50/50 shot to see whether or not he does. Also, Cruz will be out in about 45 minutes.  In about an hour's time, you'll see 32-year-old Eric Trump. His moment in the spotlight tonight. A night after following his sister and Donald Trump, Jr., who was well-greeted here by the delegation in Cleveland, Ohio.  I asked Eric Trump how the speech will go tonight. He said, it's going to be good. And then he followed with, and you're going to love it. We'll see at 10:00 Eastern Time tonight -- Megyn.KELLY: Throughout the day, political analysts have pointedly reminded people that Senator Ted Cruz has yet to endorse Donald Trump after their bitter primary battle. Now Senator Cruz is being offered some words of advice from Governor Chris Christie. The New Jersey governor delivered a resounding show of support for Donald Trump last night and is making clear he wants Senator Cruz to do the same.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J.: So I hope Ted Cruz gets up tonight when he speaks at the convention and keeps his word and endorses Donald Trump. He should, and especially the way he was kissing Donald's rear end for the first six months of the campaign. And if he doesn't, he's less of a person and then he presents himself to be to the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Katrina Pierson, national spokesperson for the Trump campaign. Good to see you.KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Thank you. Great to be here.KELLY: Happy birthday, first of all.PIERSON: Oh, thank you.KELLY: Great way for you to celebrate it.PIERSON: I can't imagine being anywhere else.KELLY: Should Ted Cruz endorse Donald Trump tonight?PIERSON: Absolutely, Megyn. Look, in the beginning, Donald Trump everyone questioned if he'd be loyal to the party. And he signed that pledge and he committed to doing everything he could for party unity. He's been meeting with leaders, he's been talking to grassroots, he's been going all over the country meeting with governors and senators and representatives because of his commitment to unite the party. Now it's time for the senator to do the same.KELLY: I know they spoke, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, do you know how that went?PIERSON: No, they are not talking about what they discussed, but they have talked, and again, Mr. Trump invited Senator Cruz to speak, again, making that effort to unify the party. Mr. Trump understands how important that is --KELLY: Will Ted Cruz get that done if he doesn't say, come on, let's get behind Donald Trump?PIERSON: I think if he doesn't endorse, it's really more of a reflection on him, not really on Mr. Trump. I mean, if we've seen the attempts to stop Mr. Trump if they've failed miserably. And the rules committee, 87 to 12 was the vote. During the Roll call, there's so much support here for Mr. Trump. Talking about 13 million Republican votes, breaking the record, 38 states.KELLY: But you said Senator Cruz's people still aren't there. They're booing Trump's plane. Which, I mean -- what do you -- just -- once again, Donald Trump overshadows Ted Cruz. I mean, it was really unbelievable.PIERSON: Well, it was a sign. It is time to acknowledge that Donald Trump won the primary and it's time to back the nominee.KELLY: It was divine intervention.PIERSON: It was divine intervention. And that's perfect for Senator Cruz.  A lot of these individuals feel like this is God's plan. But the one thing we know as believers that sometimes our plan isn't God's plan.KELLY: Do you agree with Chris Christie that it's a character moment for Ted Cruz?PIERSON: Absolutely.KELLY: He was saying, you know, after -- as he put it, the way he kissed his butt in the first six months of the campaign and then they fell apart, Cruz and Trump, that this is a character-defining moment for Ted Cruz.PIERSON: It is --KELLY: And you used to work for Ted Cruz, I want to audience to know. You know, you worked for both --PIERSON: I volunteered for his campaign, absolutely. And this is why it's much more important for Senator Cruz, because he is the candidate of the people. He is the one that runs on the constitution and wants to put government back in the hands of the people. Well, the people made their decision. And now it's time to act accordingly.KELLY: What do you make of it? Because tonight we're not just going to see Ted Cruz, we're going to see Marco Rubio, we're going to see Governor Walker. All of whom have been so harshly critical of Donald Trump. He was, of course, harshly critical of him as well. But there's been a lot of bad blood, particularly in this election cycle. How full-throatedly did they need to come out in favor of Donald Trump. And do you think, really, the party and these guys can let bygones be bygones.PIERSON: I think though. And I think that when they do come out and get their speeches, some of them are going to support the nominee, some of them want to support the party, and some want to support Donald Trump. And that may be enough with a lot of voters. However, it's different with Senator Cruz. Because he was very popular among the base. He was right there to the bitter end with Mr. Trump. And they did have a very nice relationship early on. And this is more about Senator Cruz keeping his commitments in honoring the party nominee.KELLY: So what are you, a Leo?PIERSON: Cancer.KELLY: Cancer, OK.(LAUGHTER)Kat, great to see you.PIERSON: Good to be here.KELLY: Thank you for being here.So when Senator Cruz takes the stage tonight, he's hoping to channel another conservative, who also failed to win the party's presidential nomination the first time around. In 1976, incumbent President Gerald Ford beat California Governor Ronald Reagan in the delegate battle at the convention. After President Ford delivered his acceptance speech, he waved for Ronald Reagan to come down and speak to the roaring crowd. What happened next proved Reagan's legacy was far from over.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RONALD REAGAN, 40TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I believe the Republican Party has a platform that is a banner of bold, unmistakable colors with no pale pastel shades. We've got to quit talking to each other and about each other and go out and communicate to the world that we may be fewer in numbers than we've ever been, but we carry the message they're waiting for. There is no institute for victory. Mr. President --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: What a moment. Charles Krauthammer is a Fox News contributor and syndicated columnist and with me now. Charles, how good would it be for Senator Cruz to do that tonight?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think he wants to follow the Reagan footsteps. It's one of the classic scripts in American political history. The runner-up, very popular with the base, comes in, sort of unexpectedly, delivers a speech of his night, and graciously then endorses the guy who beat him. Knowing that they might -- they were likely to lose, they did lose, it was a close race, but they did lose, and that he would be the -- and he would be the heir. Which he was.In 1980, he was the front-runner and he kept it and the rest, we know, is history. Cruz sees himself as that kind of man. Therefore, I think even though we heard this is a matter of character, he's a matter of promises, this is a matter of political calculation. Cold and raw. Cruz made a cold and raw political calculation at the beginning, first six months, don't attack Trump. Deflect, when everybody else was decrying the denunciation of Mexicans, Chinese and the McCain remarks and all of that, he refused to comment.So he thought he'll ride the Trump train, or actually a more accurate metaphor, he was drafting behind the Trump car on the racetrack. And then when it came down to a few, it was one on one, and dog eat dog. And he took a lot of insults and blows, particularly for his wife. And that's a point where I think it did get personal.KELLY: Uh-hm. And his father. And his father.KRAUTHAMMER: His father is involved in the Kennedy assassination. That is a little bit far out there. That's twilight zone.KELLY: That really got to him. You could tell.KRAUTHAMMER: It got to everybody. Because that is, you know, a little bit out there. Way out there. So now he's got to decide, I suspect -- I have no inside information. But I've been watching Cruz, I think a lot of people understand him. If his calculations are sort of astute as I think they are, and he's -- remember, he's a freshman came out of nowhere. He's the runner up in a nomination. He had no business getting this far. I think he's looking to 2020.He's going to give the speech of his life. And it will be about conservatism and beliefs and implicit criticism of Trump, perhaps, but he's got to end it with an endorsement and a call to arms to beat Hillary.  That's the script. I wonder whether he'll follow it. As you know, the real script, the one he's written has not been read by the Trump people.KELLY: Right.KRAUTHAMMER: It could be a decoy. That's what I would do. Like a phony script and then you make it up. But I think that's the path he's got to follow.KELLY: So the risk to Ted Cruz in endorsing Donald Trump is that, as you saw with the plane flyover, a lot of Ted Cruz supporters still do not like Donald Trump. They don't believe he's a conservative and they don't want Ted Cruz throwing in behind him. Although tonight we're hearing that the Texas delegation wants him to endorse him tonight, to endorse Trump tonight. And in Ted Cruz's, you know, bruising battle with Donald Trump in the primary, he called Donald Trump a pathological liar, called him utterly amoral, called him a bully, called him a fraud, called him a cavern of insecurity. And that was just for starters. So, I know that it's always difficult in the primaries. They always throw some punches, but that was extraordinary. So does he lose some credibility at all if he endorses?KRAUTHAMMER: I really think not. We have very short memories in American political history. We have had runner-ups who said something like that. I think this year, probably the level of the personal vitriol was a little bit higher than normal, but this is not off the charts. And they all reconciled, they all say, well, in the heat of the battle, you get Obama and Hillary in 2008, then all of a sudden they're chums. You get Johnson and Kennedy, 1960. This goes back a very long way.So forgetting is very easy. We have even shorter attention spans in the age of social media and television, nobody remembers yesterday. So I think that can easily -- I think Cruz will have no trouble blockading his supporters. Blockading his enemies is something different. And that's the more important job. He'll always have the support. He's not going to lose that. He needs to convert people who are pro-Trump, and should Trump lose, who will be looking for a leader.KELLY: I would love to know what happened in that phone call between the two of them, because I bet Trump was his charming -- Trump, you know, he can be his aggressive, sort of punching everybody Trump, but he can also be very charming and I would love to know how he did it with Ted Cruz. We'll find out at the end of that speech, perhaps.KRAUTHAMMER: But above all, we have two champion political calculators.  They're looking out for themselves. And here, their interests coincide.KELLY: Charles, great to see you.KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure.KELLY: Still ahead, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, and a special, special message from the Trump family about their dad. Those video compilations are -- they tend to be the best moments of these conventions, sometimes.Plus, new fallout on a fierce speech from Governor Chris Christie. Did he go too far? A couple of special guests of her own weigh in next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GOV. SCOTT WALKER, R-WIS.: -- On the phone with Donald Trump. And this very subject came out. Think about it. The Supreme Court, he and I talked about the court, he raised that as a concern, and we talked about the fact that Ronald Reagan nominated Justice Scalia over 30 years ago to be on the court, when I was in high school. We cannot conceive the court to liberals like Hillary Clinton for the next 30 years.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)The consequences are too great. After hearing the FBI director's report a few weeks ago, heck, I listened to that and said, I wouldn't even give Hillary Clinton the password to my iPhone, let alone access to highly classified information.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Governor Scott Walker fired up, speaking to a crowd without prompter. The only one we've seen, really, who's not using a teleprompter, just sort of riling up the crowd from the heart. And getting the crowd chanting ""America Deserves Better,"" we heard moments ago. We're still waiting for Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz to make remarks. When they speak, we'll going to listen in. But another big story is the continuing fallout from last night's fiery speech from Governor Chris Christie.  Governor Christie brought the convention crowd to his feet with what he called a, quote, ""prosecution of Hillary Clinton's record.""Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIE: So, as to Hillary Clinton, the charge of putting herself ahead of America, guilty or not guilty?(CROWD CHANTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Well, while most at this convention seemed to love that, a lot of mainstream media folks, uh-uh.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The night was heavy on harsh rhetoric, much of it directed at Hillary Clinton.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think it's good? They were chanting ""lock her up"", ""lock her up"" having a really good time with it. Do you think that's a good thing for American politics, when political disagreements result in basically a crowd becoming a mob saying, lock her up?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You incited this crowd to get on their feet, to talk about her, to say guilty over and over again. Do you think that is unifying the party in a way that's good for the country?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: But despite the criticism of the New Jersey governor, the attacks on Mrs. Clinton seem to be taking hold. With a new L.A. Times poll showing Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton now tied. Resulting in a polling average that is now almost a dead heat.Joining me now, former senior adviser and former campaign manager to President Obama, David Plouffe. David, great to see you.DAVID PLOUFFE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PRES. OBAMA: Great to see you, Megyn.KELLY: This is the guy who got Barack Obama elected, so who knows what he speaks.PLOUFFE: And a few other people.KELLY: I give it all to you. So, she's leading him now. The Real Clear Politics of all polls by just 2.8 percent. It's pretty close. What do you make of that?PLOUFFE: Well, we won only by four points against Governor Romney and that was an Electoral College landslide. So, it doesn't take much. But most of these poll shows, huge number of undecided voters. And the real trick for a campaign is to understand who those voters are, how they're likely to break, and what's the best way to reach them. And I think when you unpack that, it probably suggests that Hillary Clinton should be headed to a pretty comfortable lead in the national votes.KELLY: Why?PLOUFFE: But I think the question really is because, I think a lot of those undecided voters lean Democrats. I think they're going to see some Republicans stay home. And she clearly has turnout challenges too. But I look at it from the Electoral College, first. So, Mitt Romney got 203 electoral votes. And right now, I don't see a single state that Romney lost that Trump should be favored in. And that's really what --KELLY: Pennsylvania?PLOUFFE: I don't think so. I mean, Hillary Clinton's --KELLY: Ohio?PLOUFFE: No. I mean, we won -- where we were right now in Cleveland, we won this area by 260,000 votes. Won the state by almost 200,000.  Pennsylvania --KELLY: But if you look at today's polls, because he's not running against Barack Obama, he's running against Hillary Clinton.PLOUFFE: But the reality is, in both the Philadelphia area and the Cleveland area and the suburbs, she's going to walk out of there with big margins. There are just not enough votes in my view for Trump to make up.  Even if --KELLY: So why do the polls show them tied in Pennsylvania? Tied in Ohio?PLOUFFE: Well, also, you know, I ran a presidential campaign, was responsible -- I never paid attention to the polls. What matters is, you have a pretty good sense of the presidential campaign, who's going to vote.  There's a lot of people who say they're undecided, that truly aren't.  Because you have some sense of how they're likely to break, based on characteristics. The real question is, there are some true undecided voters. And that's where the campaigns lies. Both campaigns do have turnout challenges.So, I think when you look at Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, and that's the other thing. Trump could win Florida, Ohio, and Virginia and Clinton could still win the presidency, because she wins the rest of the Obama states. So she has her challenges. I think Democratic enthusiasm is not what we need it to be. She needs to work on that next week, just as Trump needs to do that here in Cleveland.KELLY: How do you think the convention is going so far? What do you think of it?PLOUFFE: Well, I think the only thing that matters is Trump's speech. He energizes Republicans, gives them more confidence, and I think particularly provides an economic message, that is captivating to true swing moderate voters, it will have been a success.KELLY: You don't think the kerfuffle over Christie is anything --PLOUFFE: No, I mean, it's -- I don't think -- I haven't seen anything yet that suggests that this would reach out to moderate voters, even voters who voted for Obama twice. But what matters is Trump's speech. So if he nails that, and I think he's got to do three things. He's got to unify the party. He's got to get the party more confident, but he also have to send a strong signal to swing voters in places like Ohio. This guy's got some interesting ideas, particularly on the economy. The truth is his son, I thought, laid out the best articulation of the Trump economic theory we've heard yet. He needs to do that tomorrow night.KELLY: You've been, you know, it's been interesting to talk to you about Trump, as this campaign has gone on. At one point you said, you know, they would rather run against Ted Cruz because Donald Trump is so unpredictable.  What do you think now?PLOUFFE: Well, when we talked a few months ago, I thought there was a chance Trump could make this race very close.KELLY: Yes.PLOUFFE: I don't think he's really seized the opportunity. I mean, he really had two to three months before Clinton got done with Sanders to define the race, define the economic choice, and really start talking toward the middle of the electorate, and unify the party. He really hasn't done those things. He's squandered that. He's still unpredictable, like getting ready for the first presidential debate, you'll going to have to prepare for like four different Donald Trumps. It's going to be an enormous challenge. I don't envy them that.And I do think he has appeal to some voters in Ohio, some voters in Pennsylvania, south west of Virginia that maybe a Cruz wouldn't. I think the trouble is he probably hemorrhages support in suburban areas. So, that's a challenge for Trump. Gain what he can in some of those more rural conservative areas without losing too much suburban vote.KELLY: David Plouffe, always so fascinating. So fascinating. Thank you so much for being here. Well, here to respond, Dr. Ben Carson, renowned neurosurgeon and former Republican presidential candidate himself. Dr. Carson, great to have you here. Thank you so much.PLOUFFE: Always great to be with you, Megyn.KELLY: So, what do you make of that? I mean, I heard that from a few pundits, that Trump and this convention has done little to reach out to persuadables and more moderate voters? Do you think that's the goal?DR. BEN CARSON, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, first of all, I would take issue with that. You know, a lot of these persuadable voters are listening to what's being said. And many of them have been buying the propaganda that's put forth by the secular progressive movement about how wonderful Hillary Clinton is. And I think that's why for the first few nights, there's been these educational seminars on who she really is.  People need to understand that.KELLY: We were talking before about all the terrible things Ted Cruz has said about Donald Trump. You were in a similar vote, where Trump was not nice to you, either. But you forgave. I mean, can you -- how did you get passed that? Because he really did savage you? But you've become a full- throated supporter.CARSON: Well, because it's not about me. If it was about me, I would never be able to get over it. But this is about our country. This is about what happens to our children and our grandchildren. This is about whether we become a country that is of and formed by the government versus a country that is of and formed by the people. That's way bigger than any individual.KELLY: What do you make of the mainstream media criticizing Chris Christie's challenge? Criticized you because you made a reference to Lucifer in talking about Hillary Clinton. Do you expect them to be as questioning if we hear harsh rhetoric at the Democratic National Convention about Trump and his supporters next week?CARSON: Of course not. They'll barely even mention it. But, you know, we don't -- we can't worry about them. They're almost a lost cause. They've forgotten what their mission is, as the press and the reason that they are the only business that's protected by the constitution, because they were supposed to be honest and on the side of the people, not taking sides.  They're a lost cause. But what we have to do is we have to go out and educate people, so that they understand what the stakes are here.  I've heard even some Republicans talking about, well, you know, if Hillary gets in, we only have to deal with it for four years, eight years at the most, but that, of course, is very naive thinking. Because not only do the Supreme Court, but the federal courts will be packed with people who share her ideology.KELLY: Those are lifetime appointments.CARSON: Absolutely. And our children will have to pay the price for that.KELLY: You know, and by the way, they are saying that Ted Cruz has already made up his mind to run in 2020, no matter -- even if Donald Trump wins.  Have you made any decisions along those lines?CARSON: Yes.KELLY: What?CARSON: I have no intention of ever running for public office again.KELLY: Never again?CARSON: No.KELLY: Why?CARSON: Well, I wouldn't even have done it this time had it not been for the tremendous outcry of the people.KELLY: Yes, they were demanding you do it.CARSON: Right. That's the only reason that I did it.KELLY: So, you don't feel melancholy at all being here, like this could have been me? This could have been my time on the stage as a nominee?CARSON: I feel relief.(LAUGHTER)Being in, you know, two or three or four cities, waking up and not knowing where you are.KELLY: Yes.CARSON: I mean, no, this is a relief. But I still am just as passionate about saving our country and I will continue to devote my efforts to making sure that we create an environment of safety and prosperity for our children.KELLY: Well, I know there's so much love for you out there among Republican voters and others as well. I mean, we hear it from our viewers of all political stripes. Thank you for spending time with us.CARSON: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Great to see you, Doc.Night three of the Republican convention is underway, and we're waiting on speeches right now from some of Trump's fiercest rivals, including Marco Rubio, and as we mentioned, Ted Cruz.And still ahead, in a ""Kelly File"" exclusive, you got to wait for this. Mark McKinnon reveals what he learned backstage, right after Donald Trump Jr. cast the votes that put Donald Trump over the top when it came to the nomination. He was there with the Trump family. He joins us live.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, day three of the RNC, and the theme of the night is ""Make America First Again."" And we are waiting two highly anticipated speeches from two former Republican presidential hopefuls, Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz.And joining us now from the floor of the convention, ""America's Newsroom co-anchor, Martha MacCallum. She's down there with the Texas delegation as we await a speech which we're told that's coming up early now. We should expect him any moment from their senator, Ted Cruz. Martha?MARTHA MACCALLUM, CO-ANCHOR, ""AMERICA'S NEWSROOM"": Hey there, Megyn, good evening. We are here in the thick of the Texas delegation. Let me tell you, this is going to be one of the most interesting moments of tonight. All day long, we've been trying to get a handle on what Ted Cruz will say and whether or not he will endorse Donald Trump tonight. The campaign has been very tight-lipped about this as has the Cruz people.It's worth pointing out that the Cruz structure is still very much in place. A lot of discussion about whether or not Ted Cruz is going to get up there and essentially make a case for himself for 2020. I have read his speech and the contents are embargoed, but I can tell you from a general sense that essentially he is not going to endorse Donald Trump. But he will stand up there and tell people that they need to vote and that they need to vote their conscience.Another person I spoke to, very high in conservative circles said to me today, this could be a Reagan '76 moment for Ted Cruz. Almost a speech that he hopes, perhaps, will make people have some buyer's remorse. That they might stand up and say, Ted Cruz is thinking like a conservative, perhaps he's the person we should have picked. Of course, it's too late for all of that. We saw the last-ditch efforts of that unfold on the floor here over the course of the last couple of nights, but the ""Never Trump Movement"" is over.But Ted Cruz will make his case as a conservative and many say with his sights on 2020 regardless of what happens here, even if Donald Trump wins this election there, those who believe that he will contest that in 2020 so, a lot of sour grapes between these two campaigns.It's interesting that he's speaking here tonight, that he was given a plot with apparently no assurance of an endorsement. So Ted Cruz will take the floor shortly here this evening. And we'll get a better sense of what he's going to say, and most importantly, Megyn, how it goes over on the floor. How will the Trump people here respond to this message from Ted Cruz tonight? Will they be receptive? We'll see. Back to you guys.KELLY: Absolutely. Martha, thank you.
