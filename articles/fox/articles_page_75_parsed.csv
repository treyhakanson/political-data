"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" April 22, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Factor ""Follow-Up"" segment tonight, one of the biggest lies in the current presidential campaign is tough criminal sentences have harmed America. In 1994, violent crime was out of control in this country. And if there had not been a federal crackdown, the Manhattan Institute estimates that 129,000 black Americans would be dead today. Crime has dropped to historic lows in the U.S.A. But that fact does not seem to penetrate the Democratic Party.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS: We need to end the so-called war on drugs which has resulted in a disproportionate numbers of African-Americans being arrested.VAN JONES, DEMOCRATIC COMMENTATOR: Right now African-Americans and white kids use drugs at exactly the same level. Nobody knows that exactly the same. But African-American kids go to prison six times more because there is this idea that these guys are the drug dealers.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now, for the record, that sound bite, that Blacks go to prison six times more than whites for drug offenses is false.With us now Heather MacDonald for the Manhattan Institute. First of all, let's deal with that Van Jones statement. Where did he get that?HEATHER MACDONALD, THE MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Well, I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and think that he was just confused in the heat of the moment because I don't know what he is talking about. The fact is, Bill, that nobody, no kid is going to prison for smoking a joint and no adult is going to prison for smoking a joint. It has to work very hard to get sentence to do prison. The major conceit here is that somehow the drug war is responsible for our incarceration rate. That's just not the case. It's violent crime that is driving our prisons and as you said, when we didn't have our incarceration rate that we do today, we had much higher levels of violent crime and the primary beneficiaries of the drop in violent crime has been Black law abiding inner city residents.O'REILLY: All right. So you say 129,000 African-Americans, the country over, who are alive today would be dead had not the federal government instituted tough sentencing on violent predators, mandatory sentences if you commit three felonies you have got to go for a long period of time. If that did not happen, then it would be 129,000 dead blacks that are still alive today, right?MACDONALD: Well, the federal crime bill was only one component of our crime drop. Frankly, what I think is more important is data driven proactive policing. And that happened in 1994 in New York City.O'REILLY: Yes. That was part of the bill.MACDONALD: No, that came out of New York City, the whole con stat idea of using data incredibly efficiently to target crime hot spots and asking officers to interview --O'REILLY: But that came with stop and frisk. Stop and frisk came with that.MACDONALD: That's part of that, exactly.O'REILLY: Right. Now stop and frisk is gone. Let's go back to the drug offenders for a moment. So you are saying that the violent crime, those people are inhabiting the prisons much more so than the drug dealers?MACDONALD: There is less than four percent of people in prison, in state prisons for possessing drugs.O'REILLY: All right.MACDONALD: Those have been --O'REILLY: But Obama, President Obama says, if you deal and we debated this stuff on the program. If we deal hard drugs nonviolent. You should not get a harsh sentence. You should get, you know, rehab or whatever, you know, assuming they are addicted. And I just think that you put the drug dealers back on the street. You don't punish them. The risk/reward goes up. They are making a lot of money and only do a little time. Right?MACDONALD: Well, again, in state prisons there's only 12 percent of people in there for actually dealing drugs.O'REILLY: Only 12 percent in state prison.MACDONALD: In state prison.O'REILLY: And when federal?MACDONALD: Fifty percent. But that's only 13 percent total of our prison population.O'REILLY: So it's a much smaller sample in federal.MACDONALD: It's irrelevant. Federal prisons are irrelevant.O'REILLY: State prisons, only 12 percent are there for dealing drugs?MACDONALD: Trafficking, right.O'REILLY: So, most of the people that have been incarcerated and people of color at a higher percentage are people who are assaulting, murdering, raping other Americans?MACDONALD: Fifty four percent of people in prison are there for violent crimes. And those people have very long criminal histories. Even people who are arrested for violent crime, 60 percent end up back on the streets. Three percent of all violent felonies and property offenders end up in prison. Ninety seven percent are not in prison.O'REILLY: Yes. They give them time after time.MACDONALD: You give time after time.O'REILLY: One more question. Whenever you hear this Bernie Sanders stuff and -- you don't hear what you just said. You never hear what you said. Why doesn't the media seek the other side of the story?MACDONALD: Racism sells. It is a powerful narrative that's put out there by the academy, by advocates.O'REILLY: What's the academy?MACDONALD: The universities.O'REILLY: The universities.MACDONALD: The criminology profession --O'REILLY: Okay. Right.MACDONALD: And the whole universities.O'REILLY: Right. So there is industry that invested in saying America is racist place and they use the crime to bolster that theory.MACDONALD: Those people should go to an inner city.O'REILLY: They don't care.MACDONALD: Community meeting, police community meeting they will hear we want more cops and want more enforcement.O'REILLY: They don't care. All right.MACDONALD: Okay. But the police are listening to the people in doing what they do.O'REILLY: Heather MacDonald, everyoneContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/07/11/perry-vs-obama-inside-politics-immigration/	Perry vs. Obama: Inside the politics of immigration	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" June 10, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The only question at this point is, why wouldn't the Texas delegation, or any of the other Republicans who are concerned about this, not want to put this on a fast track and get it on my desk so I can sign it and we can start getting to work.REP. JOHN BOEHNER, R-OHIO, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: This is a problem of the president's own making. He's been president for five-and-a-half years. When's he going to take responsibility for something?GOV. RICK PERRY, R-TEXAS: I think you could have 1,000 National Guard troops on the border -- the message sent well before that -- but in 30 days actually have them in place, and the message would be overpowering back to Central America that you no longer can put your kid on a train, put them on a bus, send them up with a coyote, and have them come into the United States because that border is now secure.(END VIDEO CLIPS)DOUG MCKELWAY, GUEST HOST: One thing you can say about Texas Governor Rick Perry is that he succeeded in getting the president to have this meeting over the crisis at the border even if he didn't succeed in getting him to go to the border. But he brings himself front and center to the national stage over this issue again. And for a guy who's got his toe in the water of the 2016 presidential campaign, he brings some liabilities as well as a lot of benefits.Let's bring in our panel now, Juan Williams, columnist with The Hill, Elise Viebeck, staff writer for The Hill, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.Juan, let's start with you. Let's talk about some of those liabilities that he brings.JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: Well, obviously, he did not prove to be quite the tough candidate in the last go-around and fell out early, and actually fell out over this immigration issue, if you recall.  He was the Republican who said that he thought that there should be in-state tuition and the like for children of immigrants.MCKELWAY: Juan, we have that sound bite from a debate 2011. Let's listen up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, SEPT. 22, 2011)PERRY: If you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they've been brought there by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCKELWAY: Much like Jeb Bush's comment that this is an act of love.WILLIAMS: Exactly. And, you know what, much like, remember, Marco Rubio, who, of course, is closely tied and somewhat damaged by his support for immigration reform in the Senate. That hurt him with some of the hard- liners who oppose immigration reform and see it as amnesty.MCKELWAY: Elise?ELISE VIEBECK, STAFF WRITER, THE HILL: I think it's interesting. Rick Perry, what he needs to do is boost his policy and intellectual chops at this point. That was what was lacking for him in the last cycle. And if he can move in that direction that would benefit him as he seeks to either climb the establishment or the conservative ladder.Now, I'm not sure what's going on at the border right now gives him those credentials, frankly. He is standing up to President Obama, which is popular with the base, but he has a lot more work to do, particularly to regain his credibility with the national media, which still has it in for him, we have to say.MCKELWAY: Charles, to his benefit, there's a new ""Harper's"" poll that came out that said 71 percent of Republicans would rather vote for a presidential candidate that backs immigration reform to 15 percent who prefer a reform foe.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: First of all, I think what's really helped him the most are the eyeglasses. He looks like a male librarian. I think he's great.Look, I don't think the poll means anything. Reform could mean anything. Reform could mean strengthening the border. So to say 70 percent of Republicans want to support a candidate who backs reform, unless you tell me the content of the reform I don't think it tells us much.I do think that what we don't quite remember is that towards the end of the primaries after the implosion in that debate where he couldn't remember the three points, he did fairly well when the spotlight came off him and he was no longer the frontrunner. He conducted himself fairly well in the subsequent debates, and he came out not bad.So I think he is positioned right now by at least being visually out there in a kind of a photo-op toe- to-toe with the president on immigration and defending the border. I think that's helped him a bit. If he wants, he could be one of the major candidates.MCKELWAY: Back to this issue of the supplemental $3.7 billion that the president wants Congress to approve for the border security problem.  Listen to Senator Richard Shelby who commented on this and how this money will be divvied up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RICHARD SHELBY, R-ALA.: While the president is seeking billions for the admission, detention, and care of illegal children and adults, only -- yes, only $45.4 million is my understanding is requested for the Department of Justice's adjudication and immigration proceedings.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCKELWAY: Juan, that's a drop in the bucket of $3.7 billion.WILLIAMS: Right. And so what you have to ask him, I think that's the concern up on the Hill, Doug, is what's this money going for? We don't want to write a blank check. And of course you're going to authorize the White House to make a lot of these decisions on this emergency basis. They say it's for not only added judges in terms of what the Justice Department would get, but you also need then people who would be court security, court personnel. You need people who would handle deportation, you need to transport people who are not being allowed to stay but are being deported back.MCKELWAY: But there are so many skeptics who say even if the president devoted billions and billions of dollars for border enforcement, one wonders whether or not they would be used at all. I harken back to the testimony well over a year ago of Chris Crane who is the head of the ICE unit who said this about border enforcement. Again, keep in mind that this is well over a year ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, FEB. 5, 2013)CHRIS CRANE, NATIONAL ICE COUNCIL PRESIDENT: As our officers are investigated by ICE for enforcing U.S. immigration law, as they see other officers threatened with suspensions for making lawful arrests, increasingly the officers feel they have become the enemy of this administration which certainly is not a healthy sign for any law enforcement organization.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCKELWAY: Charles, things have not improved since he said that.KRAUTHAMMER: I think everybody here is missing the point, especially the president when he talks about this supplemental $3.7 billion. If you look at it, as Shelby indicated, this is almost entirely money that will be spent to absorb the refugees, or the illegal immigrants, if you like. This is going to do absolutely nothing to either reverse the influx, or to prevent further influx. You can get all the judges you want. These kids are not going to show up at the deportation hearings. Everybody understands that.The problem is the 2008 law, which the president said he would get changed, that's the law that makes an exception of Central Americans. If you're a Mexican kid apprehended at the border, you get returned immediately. The Central Americans are treated differently because of an obscure law that was intended for sex trafficking. Unless that law is changed, this crisis will continue. Everybody understands that. This supplemental is a distraction, it's a red herring, it's a non-sequitur. The problem is change the law. Only the president has the power --WILLIAMS: But I don't know how it could be a red herring, Charles, if at the moment you have 50,000-plus people now, who are making appeals. That's not a red herring, that's a reality.KRAUTHAMMER: You have to deal with the --WILLIAMS: That's why Republicans say there is a crisis at the border.KRAUTHAMMER: You have to deal with the fact at the border of the U.S. and Mexico today has as much about reality as the border between Iraq --WILLIAMS: It's not Mexican kids, as you just pointed out. These are Central American kids who are in a crisis. Rick Perry said to the president, he should act without congressional approval, which I thought politically was dangerous for Rick Perry to say, as you know, the Congress thinks that the president acts with an imperial manner anyway.KRAUTHAMMER: He can't and he shouldn't, but he could propose a change in the law. He said he would.WILLIAMS: He proposed comprehensive immigration reform.MCKELWAY: And is the president going to let that stand as it is?VIEBECK: I think he will. But in fact there are two efforts in Congress to reform the 2008 law that Charles alluded to. And in fact that's likely to be attached to the passage of the supplemental.KRAUTHAMMER: Where is the president on that?VIEBECK: He said last night that in fact he would support that.KRAUTHAMMER: But why isn't it in the package then?VIEBECK: Well, that's a good question. But Congressional Republicans are going to take care of that for him.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
