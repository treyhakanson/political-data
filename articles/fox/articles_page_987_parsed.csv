This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight. A ""Kelly File"" exclusive on the gripping new film that may pose a threat to Hillary Clinton's hopes for the White House. Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly.Many insisted after her most recent testimony on Benghazi that this issue was over. Her defenders pronounced it is officially time to move on.  That the terrorist attack that took place in Libya on September 11th, 2012, which the administration argued was about an internet video offensive to Muslims was neither Mrs. Clinton's fault, nor misrepresented by her. But the issue of the families of the four Americans killed in Benghazi still looms large. At least three of the families are on record as saying that as their loved one's bodies sat at Dover Air Force Base, days after the attack, Mrs. Clinton personally approached them and blamed the murders on this internet video.Even though we now know that just two days earlier, she had told the Egyptian prime minister that the video had nothing to do with it. Days ago, at a stop in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton was pressed on why her story diverges wildly from that being told by these family members. Quote, ""Somebody is lying,"" said a columnist from New Hampshire's Conway Daily Sun, ""Who is it?"" Mrs. Clinton responded, ""Not me. That's all I can tell you."" No one is lying, let's not impugn anyone's motives here. Not, I reject the premise of your question, ""not me."" That was the answer she chose to give.But a major motion picture about to be released by Paramount Pictures, ""13 Hours, The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" makes it very clear that Benghazi was a preplanned terrorist attack. The film is introduced as a true story and reintroduces Benghazi as a potential campaign issue that cannot be helpful to Mrs. Clinton. The film is told through the eyes of the men who were there. Three of whom are with us tonight. The real-life heroes on the ground in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012. They helped Director Michael Bay craft a gripping film that captures the fierce fight to protect dozens of Americans and the desperate calls for help that went unanswered by President Obama's administration, including Hillary Clinton's State Department. We'll speak with them in a moment.But first, a new look at the story about to hit the big screens.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(Gunfire)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Benghazi is under attack. We need immediate assistance.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Base under attack.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The U.S. ambassador is --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've got to send us.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're not the first responders. You will wait.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go, we've got to roll.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have no jurisdiction in this country. We're not even supposed to be here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Losing initiative.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stand down!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are all going to die.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: None of you have to go.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are the only hope they have.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're coming in.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's still inside.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm on the roof. Don't leave me.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're under heavy fire.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, are we expecting any friendlies?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not aware of any friendlies.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let them come, let them come.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What you do right now will determine whether we live or die.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As long as I'm doing the right thing, God will take care of me.(INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're in my world now.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) I'm here in the middle of all this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shoot that son of a bitch!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Think about my girls, man.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, three of the heroes who saved dozens of Americans that night, and who wrote the book on which that film is based.Mark Geist known as Oz, Kris Paronto who goes by Tanto, and John Tiegen also known as Tig.Thank you all so much for being here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you for having us.KELLY: I know two of you have seen the film, you have not.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.KELLY: Tanto, let me start with you.KRIS PARONTO, AS TANTO: Sure.KELLY: How true to life is the film?PARONTO: Example when I walked out of the theater, I felt just drained. Like there was a big hole inside me. It was because I really virtually went back to Benghazi when I was watching it. And I missed, missed it so much that it was a part of me that I relived on the screen and I realized how much I've been missing it over the last two years.KELLY: Missed it.PARONTO: I do. I missed --KELLY: What do you mean? The film depicts absolute hell.PARONTO: It's not. It's amazing being with your brothers and fighting with them. Being there and being with them and having the faith that you're going to defeat all the obstacles. I relive it. I usually don't get like this. So, no, it just brought home a lot of the truths that we went through. And a lot of the -- the brotherhood is the best way I can explain it. So, yes, I miss it immensely. I sacrificed a lot to get to this point. And one, it's a job that I really, really love. Yes, I would go back there in a heartbeat.KELLY: The movie and the book takes the reader through the story of Benghazi. So, our viewers are up to speed. It starts off at the diplomatic outpost, the so-called consulate where the Ambassador Chris Stevens was, and the attack on that compound that was not caused by a video. Where RPGs and mortars and so on are set off and Ambassador Chris Stevens dies due to smoke inhalation along with Sean Smith. These guys in the meantime are off at the CIA annex, another post, it's a mile, less than a mile away, chomping a bit saying, send us, send us. You can hear the distress calls. You can hear the radio calls of the State Department personnel saying, we're going to die, we're going to die, we're going to die. The CIA station chief where you were at the time told you repeatedly, according to the movie, stand down. We saw that in the trailer. Used the words ""stand down."" Is that how you remember it?JOHN TIEGEN, AS TIG: Yes. I mean, there was the chief of the base, chief, and our team leader sitting on the front porch and told me to stand down.PARONTO: Tig said, hey, we're losing initiative and we were.KELLY: Why is it wrong? You know, the position is, you're here to protect the annex. They had some security personnel over at the consulate, which our viewers should know. Congressional investigators have already found was woefully inadequate and that we're totally unprepared, that state had totally left those guys unprepared to defend themselves. But in the moment, that station, chief of the annex is saying, you stand down, you're here to protect us, this facility, not that one.TIEGEN: Well, I really don't think it was just for us to protect.  That facility is just how he was. Whether it was multiple security situations when we should have left and he never have let us go.KELLY: Why?TIEGEN: I just risk adverse, in my opinion. It was his last station, he wanted his legacy to be what it was, he didn't want to lose anybody, I guess.KELLY: You got trained army rangers, you got Navy SEALs, you got marines --TIEGEN: Yes.KELLY: The best in the world standing there ready to go, armed in the teeth trained for exactly this saying -- they're saying they're going to be dead. We're going.TIEGEN: Yes.KELLY: How many times did he tell you to stand down?TIEGEN: He already told Tanto to wait twice, and he told me to stand down. Which even a ""wait"" technically is pretty much a stand down, too.PARONTO: Yes.TIEGEN: You know, it's just -- I don't know why he would rely on militia that's not even military trained. They're barely trained --KELLY: But he's telling you guys the Libyans are going to protect Ambassador Stevens. The Libyans have it. They Libyans who had already run from the front of the diplomatic facility, were going to handle it, which of course they did not. But ultimately the movie depicts you guys saying, we're going. And Tyrone Woods specifically saying, and that quoted in the movie, saying to all of you, we -- it's up to you. But we're the only hope they have. Did that really happen?PARONTO: That did happen. And the radio call from Alec Henderson coming across saying, hey, if you guys don't come here, we're all going to bleeping die, that's word for word, that's what actually spurned us.KELLY: You all have testified to this and the trailer that we just watch, it captures the two with the writing on the screen, there was no support. And having seen the film this morning, if there's one theme that emerges, that is it, that they were left alone. There was no one to back you up. Throughout the film, you see heroes assuming, understanding based on their experience that the American military will be there to back them up and support them. And help never came. I mean --TIEGEN: I mean, for us, for the military to come and support us, the agency, we wouldn't have expected it. But the fact that they had the U.S. ambassador that had been missing for about five hours before they actually officially -- he was considered dead and they didn't send anything or attempt to push anything that way is pretty crazy. I would never expect them to just leave the ambassador out there.KELLY: And what about all the CIA personnel in the annex this?PARONTO: My view is they didn't even try, and that's where the film does a great job of showing that even though the headquarters with the Department of Defense were getting assets and moving them, they eventually just stopped for some reason, we still don't know why.KELLY: What did you expect would come? What did you think would show up, who or what?PARONTO: The biggest thing I think we really need was mainly air support. I mean, kind of --MARK GEIST, AS OZ: Just something to fly over.KELLY: How hard would that have been?TIEGEN: Not hard. Again people see the movie and read the book, know that it wouldn't have been difficult.KELLY: And all we sent was an unmanned drone.TIEGEN: And it wasn't helpful at all.KELLY: I want to go back, because one of the things that gets lost I think in the coverage of Benghazi too is the loss of our ambassador, who was portrayed in the film was a good man.PARONTO: Very good.KELLY: Who was just trying to do the right thing, who had begged for security increases there and was denied, was denied those security increases. And they had in fact been diminished repeatedly leading up to September 11th. And that's another thing that the investigators have found which was, he had no business being in Benghazi on 9/11, the administration should not have allowed it. And if they're going to send them, they should have sent him with proper security. But he was killed that night. And you went to the consulate the very facility which he was killed. You kept running in to try to get him, right?TIEGEN: Multiple times.KELLY: And the smoke was too much. Describe that moment when you knew he was in there, you didn't know whether he was dead.TIEGEN: Umm, I was on my belly the last time I went in before we got counterassaulted and there was smoke down there and you could only see about maybe two feet in front of your face. And, you know, it was just so thick and so hot, it's just like being in a brick oven. I mean, you're just sweating constantly and it was extreme heat and just coughing.  Because you can't really hold your breath because your adrenaline is pumping and, you know, you've been running around for the last hour, you know, fighting your way on and then searching. And so, I mean, it was pretty intense.KELLY: Do you believe that if you had been allowed to go when you first said ""Send us"" and the radio calls came in from the consulate saying help us, help us, do you believe there would have been any chance to save them?GEIST: Oh, yes, they would be alive today 100 percent.KELLY: The Congressional investigators concluded there was no stand down order.PARONTO: I don't know where they got that. That's just silly.KELLY: I mean, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and others rely on those conclusions saying, you know, they've really been cleared because investigators concluded there was no stand down order.TIEGEN: It's funny, everything that we testified to, you know, they agreed with us 100 percent, I mean, from pretty much was eating a candy bar to, you know, shooting the ammo, but for some reason, they don't want to believe that we were told we were to stand down.KELLY: Do you have a political motive? Do you have --GEIST: No. The one who should have got the star was sent right there because he saved Tyrone's life by going in the building and finding him when he was lost. And then, he's the first one that come up on the roof and put two tourniquets on Dave and got a tourniquet on my arm and probably saved both of our lives.PARONTO: And had to see him naked once, that's an honor right there.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: When this audience sees this film and sees what you all went through and you asked what happened to your arm, which was basically hanging off --GEIST: From about right here there.PARONTO: That was impressive seeing him trying to get it. I remember watching him seeing him trying to get his gun up and that arm is hanging -- I can't say it much. Because I don't want to give a marine anymore kudos in what they are to get, but I'd be honest, I was pretty impressed seeing that after the mortars hit and seeing him still --  KELLY: And when he went down to get help, it wasn't for himself.PARONTO: Hu-huh.KELLY: It was for the gentleman you just referenced who also had been hit. And so Oz walks in down below to where the CIA agents are to say there's another guy, his arm is dangling and he says there's somebody who is hurt and needs help. And you refused to go on that airplane that ultimately got you guys out of there on a gurney.GEIST: Yes.KELLY: Why? Tell them what you said and why he said it.GEIST: I walked into that country, I'm going to walk out. I mean, again, it's who I am. I'm not going to -- I mean, I don't know. It's just -- I just felt compelled to -- I'm not going to let that -- I'm not going to lose.KELLY: To the end. It wasn't the United States that was there for you.GEIST: And that's kudos to Glenn Doherty and his team in Tripoli getting that aircraft to us.KELLY: Last subject, you come back, the video, it was all about a video. And we heard the family say that, that's how we kicked out the segment, that Hillary Clinton, according to the family members, looked at them, at Dover Air Force Base when the bodies came back in the casket and said, we're going to get the guys that made that video. And now when asked who is lying, you or the families, she says, well, it's not me. And of course, she's talking about Glenn's family, she's talking about Tyrone's family, she's talking about Sean's family.PARONTO: And I know Pat Smith, I know Katie Quigley, Glenn's sister.  We know Ty's mom. We know what they told us was said and I do know them very well. And Katie has been on news quite a bit telling you what she was told. And I know that they were told it was a video, because that's what they told me. I believe Pat. I believe Katie. I believe Charles Woods.GEIST: And it's easy. I mean, who would have a reason to lie? Why?  Their loved ones just died.  PARONTO: Simple.GEIST: Exactly. They have no reason to tell anything but the truth.KELLY: When you saw the testimony of Hillary Clinton, she testified twice, and the first time she made big headlines when -- well, we have the clip. This is what she said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The fact is, we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk that decided they'd go kill some Americans. What difference at this point does it make?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: What's your response to her?PARONTO: It makes a huge difference, and that's -- this is what I was talking about with the politics of it. They're politicking of and just getting it down to where it turns into a reality show -- they're keeping it to a Kardashian type show where the truth is not being told. That's one of the reasons why that pushed us to go out and stay political but tell the truth of what happened on the ground, because it does matter. It matters to honor our friends that passed away. It matters because we need to honor Ambassador Stevens and to honor the families that need to know the truth of what took place there that night, because they didn't know.KELLY: Incredible. You will not leave your seat for two plus hours when you see that movie. Don't make plans to get something to eat.  Because you will be sitting there white knuckled for two hours. It was riveting and it comes out on January 15th. And coming up later in the broadcast, how you can help those guys if you are so inclined.Well, we also have a big story developing tonight as Donald Trump and Bill Clinton go head to head over how the former president treats women.  Chris Stirewalt and Howie Kurtz are here on what is now the hottest fight on this campaign trail.Plus, did ISIS just pull off a horrifying terror attack inside of Israel? One of our top terror analysts Dr. Sebastian Gorka was in Tel Aviv when this attack unfolded. He joins us tonight on what could be the next front in the war on this terror group.And then the Bundy family tonight finds itself at the heart of a dramatic new armed standoff. This time taking over a federal building in Oregon. Ammon Bundy joins us live to tell us, why they think this cause is important to all Americans and to answer those who say it's actually about lawlessness.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AMMON BUNDY, LEADER OF OREGON STANDOFF: We make a stand so it will not happen to other people across this country, so they will not come into our homes and take away our rights and they will not come into our children's home and take away their rights.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Breaking tonight, with less than a month to go before the first votes in Iowa, the polls are showing what looks like a tight Republican race at the Iowa caucuses. But the big story this evening concerns the back and forth between Donald Trump and the husband of the Democratic front-runner. As former President Bill Clinton hits the campaign trail for his wife, Hillary. At this time, Mr. Trump is ramping up attacks on the President's treatment, the former president's treatment of women. And now Trump is getting pressed on an apparent change of heart on this issue. Does Trump think the Lewinsky scandal is actually a deal breaker? Here's what Trump said today compared to what he was saying back in 2008.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He lied. He got us into the war with lies. And I mean, look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant and they tried to impeach him, which was nonsense.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Years ago, you said Monica Lewinsky shouldn't have chased after it like this, Bill Clinton's sex life shouldn't be an issue.  Now, you're saying, it's like, one of the main issues. You know, how is a voter supposed to see you for that?TRUMP: No, no, I've tried to help a little bit because they were -- it was important for me, as secretary of state, as a senator, to have all these people on my side. I needed votes. I'd need many things done. I needed votes. And I would have these people on my side. So I wasn't going to get involved in the Monica Lewinsky thing and I wouldn't get involved in it now.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Chris Stirewalt is our Fox News digital politics editor and Howie Kurtz is the host of ""MediaBuzz"" right here on FNC. Gentleman, Happy New Year. Good to see you both.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Happy New Year!HOWIE KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": Happy New Year, Megyn.KELLY: All right. So, Trump says some stuff about Hillary while we were all on vacation that was, shall we said, widely perceived as sexist.  And then Bill Clinton goes out on the campaign trail and now Trump, what is he doing here, trying to recapture the moral high ground by trying to say, sexism? I'm not really pointing to Stirewalt. That's Trump pointing over Bill.STIREWALT: Right.KELLY: Is that what's happening, Stirewalt?STIREWALT: So, this is -- I think we're referencing his reference to a Yiddish word for a part of the male anatomy and how that happened to Hillary Clinton. I don't know if you're saying that word but that's what he was talking about.KELLY: I've been told that we've been bleeping it out here on the Fox News.STIREWALT: Don't bleep me, sister.KELLY: Wouldn't be the first time.STIREWALT: Exactly. So, the deal here is, Trump is accused of sexism for saying that this act was done to Hillary Clinton. And he says everybody in New York talks about that act and that Yiddish term all that time. We people from West Virginia hadn't caught up with all that language until recently. So, we think American politics for teaching us about these words and these terms. But anyway, the point being, Trump says, oh, yes, you think I'm sexist? Your husband, and look at this.And I'll tell you what, when you go back to the videotape on this one, there's plenty, and the big difference, of course, now is that 20 years ago, the social justice movement, feminism and everything else was in a very different place about what happens when you have relations with, you know, Congress, with 21-year-old interns in your office. It ain't funny on the Left now. It was funny to them then. Trump bringing this up now, it hits back to the Clintons where it hurts.KELLY: That's the thing, you know, Howie, is that she is probably, you tell me, helped by Bill Clinton, more than hurt by Bill Clinton?  Because the Democrats in particular love him. I mean, his approval ratings nationwide are very strong. But there is a weakness there, and so far no one has really exploited it. And Trump is saying, I'm the only one who has and the only one who will.KURTZ: Well, look, Bill Clinton's past misconduct is obviously fair game. He was out on the campaign trail for her today in New Hampshire.KELLY: A lot of the Democrats have said, move on. Even some Republicans have said, don't get back into the nastiness of the Clinton affairs and all the other stuff, because it will be bad for the Republicans.KURTZ: Well, I think it's kind of priced into the Clinton stock, at least for anybody who was alive in 1998 and 1999. But in classic fashion, Megyn, Trump has been aided and abetted here by the main stream media for which this whole story is catnip and a very happy to go back about Bill and Monica and Bill and Jennifer and Bill and Paula and the whole impeachment saga. Even though I think a lot of voters would probably read and hear more about Trump and touched their lives at what happened back in the '90s.KELLY: Why? And so, Trump goes back to his -- on his flip-flop, because there he was in 2008 saying something very different than what he's saying now about this problem for Hillary and Bill, and his explanation is one we've heard before, Chris, which is, I was trying to buy them. I was trying to buy them, so I had to say that it wasn't a big deal, I didn't really feel that way, but I needed to buy them, and I will say what I needed to say.STIREWALT: We have asked this question before and never gotten a satisfactory answer. What did he get for all of this, if, let's say, he said something he thought wasn't true about Bill Clinton's actions. Let's say he did that. But he believed at the time that it was bad. What did he get for that? He said, he needed her influence, he told CNN, he needed her influence as Secretary of State. He needed her influence as a senator --KELLY: But how?STIREWALT: -- to get him thinks for both.KELLY: That's the question.STIREWALT: But what did you get? Where is the pale?KELLY: What about this, Howie? Trump has admitted that if he goes here with Hillary, he opens himself up. He's at his third marriage. He's had affairs that have been documented by the press. You know, this is not necessarily the easiest issue for him, either.KURTZ: No. And he does open it up. And as you say, he's acknowledged that. I mean, I covered all the Clinton sex scandals in the '90s. But I also covered the very ugly break-up between Donald and his first wife Ivana and his relationship with Marla Maples. And so, it really depends on how much public interests there is in rehashing all this at this point. And how much the media wants to turn up the volume here. I mean, again, it's all fair game when you're running for president. But should this be front and center in the presidential race when it's Hillary who is the candidate?KELLY: My head is swimming. Great to see you both.(LAUGHTER)Remember Christmas when we were just like eating turkey?OK. Breaking tonight, new details on missing country music star Craig Strickland. We'll tell you what his family is now saying after the musician's body was found earlier today.Plus, ranchers versus the Feds take two. We'll speak with one of the men leading an armed takeover of federal property. See why he believes he's on the right side of the law and what the law has to say about that, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID WARD, HARNEY COUNTY, OREGON SHERIFF: You said you were here to help the citizens of the Harney County. That help ended when a peaceful protest became an armed occupation.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, an armed standoff in the Oregon wilderness shows no sign of ending any time soon. It started with a group of ranchers unhappy that two of their neighbors were sentenced to lengthy federal prison stints for starting fires on their own land.Dwight and Steven Hammond got five years sentences after some of those fires spread to federal land. Their supporters for it protested, and then a group broke off and decided to take control of a National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, trying to make a point that the Feds here are really just trying to stick it to the ranchers.Among them, the sons of rancher Cliven Bundy, who had his own memorable and controversial dispute with the Feds back in 2014. In moments, we will be joined by one of the Bundy sons, Ammon Bundy. But we begin with Trace Gallagher reporting from our West Coast newsroom. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, 73-year-old, Dwight Hammond and his 46-year-old son, Steven, arrived at the federal prison near Los Angeles late today, after some brief goodbyes. The two men walked through the gates to begin serving their five-year prison terms. Their Hammond's ranch interlocks with federal property, so for years, the family and Bureau of Land Management have worked together to manage the vast area where the Hammonds cattle graze.In the early 2000s, the Hammonds claim the Fed gave them permission to start fires intended to protect those cattle. BLM says there was no permission and three years ago, Dwight and Steven Hammond were convicted of arson. They served their original sentences, three months for the older Hammond, a year for the younger.But because they were prosecuted under a federal anti-terrorism law that mandates at least five years, the government took the rare step of appealing the shorter sentences. Now because the government is playing hardball with the Hammonds, armed protesters have taken over several buildings at a Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Oregon.The man leading the takeover Ammon Bundy claims he's fighting against the government oppression. But the local sheriff thinks Bundy wants to overthrow the local and federal government. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID WARD, HARNEY COUNTRY SHERIFF: The Hammonds have turned themselves in. It's time for you to leave our community, go home to your families, and end this peacefully.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Ammon Bundy says he's with 150 armed protesters. Those are unseen, saying numbers are about 15. But the FBI is clearly trying to avoid another Ruby Ridge or Waco, Texas, and so far, there has been zero law enforcement presence at the refuge. And imminent confrontation is unlikely.But remember, the government retreated from a standoff last year with the Bundys over grazing rights in Nevada. And experts say not acting this time could embolden more anti-government groups. Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you. Joining me now, Ammon Bundy, one of the leaders of the standoff. The group is now calling itself Citizens for Constitutional Freedom.Ammon, thank you very much for being here tonight. So, how is what you are doing not lawlessness?AMMON BUNDY, LEADER OF OREGON STANDOFF: Well, I think that we have to go to the supreme law of the land to answer that question, and that is that the federal government does not have authority to come down into the states and to control its land and resources. That is for the people to do. And that is clearly stated in Article 1817 of the Constitution.KELLY: But, you know, the argument on the other side, which is these ranchers, whom you support, but you're not directly involved, had their day in court. And they were found guilty and it went all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which denied their appeal. Isn't that the way it's supposed to work in our country when it comes to the rule of law?BUNDY: Yes. Well, let me ask you and I'm sure you know the answer, but who was the plaintiff?KELLY: Keep going.BUNDY: No, I'm asking, who was the plaintiff against the Hammonds?KELLY: I'm waiting for you to make your point. Generally I don't answer questions on my show, I ask them.BUNDY: Oh, well, I mean, it was asked intended to be answered, but the plaintiff is the federal government and yet, they're also the prosecutors are the federal government. And those who want their land is the federal government. And those agencies that have been oppressing the people here are the federal government.There is no proper redress, because our -- the design of this, the structure of this government is not intended for the federal government to come down against individuals in a state on these matters. And that is what this is all about.KELLY: What -- your brother, Ryan, apparently told the Oregonian, Ian -- I think it's called Oregon of the Oregonian, that you are willing to kill and be killed, if necessary here. Do you agree with that?BUNDY: That statement was taken way out of context. I've already talked to my brother about that, and so, no, I wouldn't agree with it, because it wasn't his statement.KELLY: So, you disallow that, you will not let this come to violence?BUNDY: Well, I have a family. I have six children, a beautiful wife. I have a wonderful home. I have a business, several employees. I'm not here to die. I'm here to defend my freedoms and my liberties, and will I? Yes. But it's not going to come to that. There's good things that are going to come from this, and things are going to get straightened out. And that's what we're here and we're confident that that is going to happen. And it will be a benefit for many, many people across this nation, and I can pass a law of what I've enjoyed in this life on to my children.KELLY: Well, Mr. Bundy, thank you for being with us tonight with your perspective.BUNDY: Thank you.KELLY: Breaking tonight, new details from the family of country music star Craig Strickland after his body was just found by police.Plus, did ISIS just pull off its first successful attack inside Israel? We have got the dramatic, dramatic video. And Dr. Sebastian Gorka is here with what it means. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, security teams in Israel are now in day four of an intense manhunt for the shooter behind last week's deadly attack in Tel Aviv. He was caught on surveillance video browsing a health food store before pulling out a semi-automatic rifle and shooting up the bar next door.He killed two people and injured at least seven others in this attack. And now the question is whether ISIS - ISIS may have had a role in this.Dr. Sebastian Gorka was in Tel Aviv when this unfolded. He'll join us in a moment. But first, Trace Gallagher has new details on the attack. Trace?GALLAGHER: Megyn, during recent terror attacks in Israel either with a knife or vehicle, the attackers always stayed at the scene, indicating they wanted to be killed by security forces. But in this case, the suspect used a semi-automatic weapon and then escaped, resembling the ISIS-inspired attacks in Brussels, Paris, and San Bernardino.So far, ISIS has not claimed responsibility for the attack in Tel Aviv that killed two people, but it comes just days after ISIS leader, Abu Bakr threatened Israel with violence.Authorities believe the shooter is a 29-year-old Israeli Arab with a long criminal history, including trying to steal a weapon from an Israeli soldier. Police reportedly found a copy of the Koran in his bag indicating potential Islamic inspiration. Although the suspect's family says he is mentally unstable. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MOHAMMED MILHEM, FATHER OF SUSPECTED SHOOTER (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): I heard that my son did what he did in Tel Aviv. I did not educate him this way. I'm sorry for what he did. When I got to know about the incident, I went to the police station by myself and I helped the security forces.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: It is still unclear if he acted alone or had an accomplish. But Israeli investigators say the longer the hunt for the killer goes on, the more likely it is that he's getting outside help or is holding up in a prearranged hiding place. Security in Tel Aviv remains on high alert. Megyn?KELLY: Well, Trace, thank you.Joining me now with more, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, who provides counterterrorism training to the FBI and Special Forces. He serves as the major general G - Major General Matthew C. Horner distinguished chair of military theory at Marine Corps University. Doctor, thanks for being here tonight.So, I mean, a little eerie with you, because you were right out there in California when the terror attack there happened. You're in Tel Aviv when this one happened. Do you believe this is ISIS in Israel? Because we see Israel attacked a lot, it tends to be the Palestinians and, you know, not ISIS.SEBASTIAN GORKA, MARINE CORPS UNIVERSITY FELLOW: Well, happy New Year, Megyn. And first, if I may commend you on the interview you did with those Benghazi heroes. Thank you very much. That was amazing.KELLY: Thank you.GORKA: Look, there's something very interesting about this attack that really links it to the other ones as were mentioned, not only in Europe but in California. Since September, there have been dozens of knife attacks in Israel, which have led some people to call this the third intifada.Young couples being attacked, people being mercilessly knifed down, but the perpetrators stayed there and were usually intercepted or shot by IDF or Israeli security forces right there on the scene. In this case, we actually have the video of this young man, very coolly, very calmly they are going to that shop next door, taking out the weapon, loading the weapon and then gunning down those two young men and eight other victims.Which is very similar, if you recall the footage of the Charlie Hebdo shooters and also the footage -- or the reports from California, individuals who very cold bloodedly mowed down those innocent individuals, and then moved on to try and execute another attack or simply to escape. So, even if there aren't operational ties back to Abu Bakr and ISIS, the way in which this was done, the modus operandi really is something different, Megyn.KELLY: And it's chilling, because here you see this guy just dropping in a grocery store. And the next thing you know, people are dying in the bar next door. I mean, basically what we're seeing here is this radical Jihadism.GORKA: Well, what we're seeing here, and this is the most important thing, is the growth, the popularity of this ideology. I've said for years now, we've got to stop looking at individuals trying to counter radicalized or focusing on is it AQ, is it ISIS? Forget all that. It's about people who share the same ideology. Whether it's Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooter, whether it's Tsarnaev Brothers in Boston or this man or the two -- the couple in California.KELLY: Right.GORKA: The connective tissue is the ideology of Jihad.KELLY: Dr. Gorka, good to see you.GORKA: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Still ahead, a special request from the real-life Benghazi heroes who led our show tonight. Plus, Candy Carson, Ben Carson's wife is here with an eye opening new book. Wait until you hear this. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new details in the death of country star, Craig Strickland. Police confirming today, that the 29-year-old lead singer of the band, Backroad Anthem, is dead. His body was found on the bank of a creek in Oklahoma. He died from hypothermia. Strickland and his friend Chase Morland were last seen on a duck hunting trip where their boat may have capsized during a storm. Morland's body was found on December 28th.Since the launch of his republican presidential campaign, the life story of Sr. Ben Carson has inspired the admiration of a big group of voters, and from his climb, the story of it, from poverty stricken streets of Detroit to the halls of Yale University, one woman has been by his side. Candy Carson is here with her new book, ""A Doctor in the House, My Life with Ben Carson."" Candy, great to see you again.CANDY CARSON, BEN CARSON'S WIFE: It's great to be back.KELLY: So, 100 percent of the royalties are going to go to charity. And you wrote this book to tell us what about Ben Carson that we don't already know?CARSON: Well, to give you a better perspective, a broader perspective of what he is like and what our life has been like.KELLY: Speak to the issue. His credibility took a hit, you know, in recent months where a lot of news outlets attacked him as allegedly not being a truth teller on the issue of his bio. What do you say to that?CARSON: You know, being through the process now, there's edits that don't get done. There's edits in this book that didn't get done, but they're going to be corrected by the next printing. So, there are things that might not be quite there, quite correct, but he has addressed those issues.KELLY: Do you think, is his campaign in trouble? Because the news today was that three of his high ranking advisers including his campaign manager, quit on Thursday, last week.CARSON: Well, you know, growing pains. If something's not quite working because it's been working great for a long time, but there are other things that weren't quite growing at the same rate as his campaign. So, restructuring took place and they decided that they preferred to resign.KELLY: Is it true that he's got a quirky sense of humor, that he tells jokes about a guy tried to date two timing a woman named Kate and Edith?CARSON: Definitely.KELLY: And then he said the two women discovered he had been two timing them and they killed him. The moral is that, you can't get your Kate and Edith, too.CARSON: You made that one up, yes. Yes.KELLY: Is this what we are going to get if we have a president Carson?CARSON: The corn is there.KELLY: The corn and the corny.CARSON: Definitely.KELLY: Well, listen, I wish you luck with the book. I understand it must be very difficult to be the spouse of the candidate because it's easy to take the licks yourself. It's quite another to see your loved one take them.CARSON: Yes.KELLY: So good for you.CARSON: But, you know, I know that he's been consistent and fair, and he's going to be a wonderful president he has to...(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: A lot of viewers wanting to do something for the Benghazi heroes from earlier. One of them as started the Shadow Warriors project. It supports wounded American private contractors like these guys with their medical bill's needs. Here's the web site. Give it a look.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.OUTLINE OF POSSIBLE NUKE DEAL WITH IRAN SPARKING DEBATESTEVE FORBES: As Churchill once said about Munich, ""This thing is an unmitigated disaster."" It's going to set the stage for a nuclear holocaust in the Middle East. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have already indicated they are going to go with their own nuclear programs. Either you have a program or you don't. The Iranians have it, and they are going to continue with it. This is bad all around.BRUCE JAPSEN: I think that there are a lot of politics that have to play out in this country. There are also a lot of hardliners coming out of Iran that didn't like the deal that thought the West got too much. I think it's a good thing because it marginalizes these hardliners in Iran. If they don't like it, it's a good thing because it makes them less important over there.SABRINA SCHAEFFER: I have mixed feelings about it. I think it's only concerning if you miss a deadline when your end goals aren't clear. That is what we are really picking up on is that this is an administration whose end goals have not really been clear. It has been clear that it's reluctant to use force. Foreign policy and diplomacy is nuance- we need to consider our own financial interests. Is John Kerry over there really worried about the United States best interest or if he gets a Nobel Peace Prize?RICH KARLGAARD: John Kerry and President Obama seem to be driven by personal reasons for personal glory. How narcissistic do you have to be to put the whole world at danger for your own legacy?ELIZABETH MACDONALD: There is a good reason that Americans (smartly) understand what is going on- indicated by the poll. The Iranians have cheated and they have lied. No deal is better than this bad deal. They can make these existing centrifuges 20 times faster and have smaller enrichment facilities that they can hide.JOHN TAMNY: The oil is going to flow into the U.S. regardless; this only becomes an oil story if the U.S. intervenes because that would be negative for the dollar. My problem is that why are we negotiating? Any agreement no matter how strong or weak is not worth the paper it's printed on. At some point we need to realize we needlessly elevate these countries by negotiating with them in the first place.NEW WHITE HOUSE 'GREEN' PLAN FUELING CONCERN OVER POTENTIAL IMPACT ON ECONOMYSABRINA SCHAEFFER: This will hurt the economy by driving up costs for Americans at home as well as businesses. This is not the first time the EPA has suggested to do something like this without driving up costs. They are wrong, remember the clean power plan which we found from an independent research association which said it would be 7 times more expensive than the EPA said it would be.BRUCE JAPSEN: I think go bold and go big here. We always hear it's going to kill jobs, but we are still creating jobs- and we have been for months and months now. I just don't see it.ELIZABETH MACDONALD: The EPA Chief Gina McCarthy said about these new rules. She said if you add up what we will avoid between now and 2030 it's more than double the carbon pollution from every power plant in America in 2012. So that puts it in perspective. She also said it would be the equivalent of cancelling out all the cars and trucks on the road. So there's your economic impact.JOHN TAMNY: Of course it's going to hurt the economy, but that's precisely why it's not going to happen. Let's repeat this, the Obama administration is over with- it has been over with since the end of 2012. No future president or congress is going to abide such a lousy deal. Markets realize that and that is why they're rallying. No one takes this seriously.STEVE FORBES: This is part of Obama's war against prosperity. Putting on these extra costs on the economy is going to slow it down. We are the one big country in the world where emissions have gone down- what's the problem?BILL BALDWIN: This is going to boost the economy. If you make the mistake of only counting GDP and not whether we are better off- WWII boosted GDP because it kept people busy building bombs. The war on carbon is going to keep people busy building power plants ---- (cross chatter).CALIFORNIA WATER REDUCTION MANDATE DOES NOT APPLY TO FARMERSRICH KARLGAARD: I don't think its crony capitalism so much as it's misplaced romantic love of farmers- you see it in France and in the Iowa caucuses. Social media chatter I think is going to undermine the farmers this time. As you pointed out, when you look at 80 percent of the water and 2 percent of the GDP it's ridiculous.STEVE FORBES: It shows the misbegotten policies of water in California, which goes back to the 1870s- massive subsidies. What they should allow farmers to do if they have excess is sell it on the free market. The problem would be solved. Right now it's all about lobbying.BILL BALDWIN: When it comes to crony capitalism, the farmers have nothing on the greens who did 2 things: they blocked the construction of new reservoirs and secondly they persuaded the government that the natural way to help the deltas mill was to empty a manmade reservoir into the ocean. That is where the problem is.SABRINA SCHAEFFER: It's interesting to see the greens fighting their own impulse. The explanation is simple; we have had price control and massive subsidies for farmers and a shortage of supplies. The end result is that water is cheap- it's easy to waste and that's the real problem.CARRIE SHEFFIELD: Everyone has to step up. I'm from Utah. When I was a kid we had to watch our sprinkler use. To ignore farmers is to ignore the massive jumbo-sized elephant in the room. 80 percent of the consumption. Farmers are 22 percent inefficient that would solve their drought problem right there.'EMERGENCY FUND' PICKSBILL BALDWIN: (SMG)ELIZABETH MACDONALD: (HEWG)"	['Obama', 'McCarthy']	[]
