This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""The FBI may have cleared Hillary Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing, but this e-mail scandal is not going away any time soon. Now some members of Congress want answers. Tomorrow, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will question Director James Comey. On Tuesday, his boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch will face the judiciary committee. Speaker Paul Ryan wants the FBI to handover all findings from the investigation and says Clinton should be blocked from having further access to classified materials.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), HOUSE SPEAKER: He did say that short of prosecution, some kind of administration -- administrative action might be in order. Look, I was on the ticket in 2012. After the convention, you get the full deep classified information as part of transition. It's part of being a nominee. I think the DNI, Clapper, should deny Hillary Clinton access to classified information during this campaign, given how she so recklessly handled classified information.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Ryan also said that this case sums up the political machine that the Clinton has created.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RYAN: This certainly does underscore the belief that the Clintons live above the law. And this is one of the reasons why people are so dissatisfied, so upset about government. They think that people live by different sets of rules, and the Clintons, they take the candle on this one.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right, I'm going to go quickly -- quick to this RNC ad that they put together with Comey's statements versus Hillary Clinton's statements. A short clip of that and then get everybody's reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails instead of two.JAMES COMEY, DIRECTOR, FBI: She also used numerous mobile devices to send and to read e-mail on that personal domain.CLINTON: I did not e-mail any classified materials to anyone on my e-mail.COMEY: One hundred and ten e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information.CLINTON: There were no security breaches.COMEY: We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact .(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: OK, so often when you get a baffling decision like the one that FBI Director Comey put forward yesterday afternoon. After a night sleep, you wake with all that more clarity. But Kimberly, I saw you this morning after reading all the press, I felt like it was still as confusing as before and so why it happens?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah, and still kind of a shocking in many ways because of the 14 minutes spent diligently going through all the detail, all the specifics, really making the case, well, it's like he's really giving us a tremendous amount of information of this, an opening statement? Closing argument for the case against Hillary Clinton? Oh, but no. Because at the end, like it was some kind of weird copy/paste situation, but the wrong conclusion was put in.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: And it just -- it was like, whoa, what happened here? And when you see him, I almost felt sorry for him in these videos, because he really looks like almost like a hostage to the situation. Like he's not -- like he's had a hard time of it, he didn't look great. So I imagine that this wasn't something that he was personally proud of. He didn't take questions afterwards, but he's going to have to face questions going forward and let's see if he answers them in the interest of transparency.PERINO: Greg, do you think that FBI Director Comey was trying to strike a balance in his head, that he thought that the verbal punishment that he was delivering in the statement before the conclusion would be enough to exonerate him from any blame that it was political?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I think so. I think the republicans, especially tomorrow should embrace Comey. He didn't just leave an impression on Hillary; he left a crater the size of little rock. I mean he, he handed to the republicans the road map to victory. He laid out every single flaw. And if you attack Comey on this, it's a mistake. You got to stick to Hillary. By the way, it would be hilarious to have a presidential candidate without a security clearance. That's like -- it's like Danica Patrick without her driver's license. He would essentially make it so that they can't do their job, by really -- I think that, you know, he did something -- he did something he didn't have to do. I think at this point, if you -- you could run a sack of potatoes with a wig against Hillary and beat her at this point, which is kind of what we're doing.PERINO: I think all -- in some of the coverage, Eric --(CROSSTALK)ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Why Hillary?PERINO: Well, I was going to ask you about --(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: That was proof right there. I'm sorry.PERINO: No, I was just going to ask you about President Obama's complicit in this scandal, I think, because they all knew that she was using .(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . this e-mail address and they didn't do anything about it.BOLLING: Well, yeah. Perhaps, yes, but also they had to know this recommendation was coming down this way. There is no way on Sunday or Monday President Obama says, ""I will meet with you. I'll fly you on Air Force One to North Carolina, we'll land and I'll be standing next to you on a stage for our very first campaign event."" If he doesn't know the recommendation earlier -- hours earlier was gonna be --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Yes --PERINO: Well, but they announced the trip a week -- the week before.BOLLING: Yeah, but still -- OK, let me ask you this. If they, if they --GUILFOYLE: That morning there, the campaign will confirm .BOLLING: Right.GUILFOYLE: . yes or no, we're getting pushed back that he is not promising to (inaudible).BOLLING: How is it? It's the weather. We can't get on Air Force One because of the weather. There could have been anything if there was going to be a recommendation to indict. James Comey spent 15 minutes on -- with this presentation. He did three or four minutes on -- remember three things; what we did, what we found, what we recommend? Three or four minutes on what we did, about 10 minutes on what we found, the vast majority of his time speaking is what we found and that is bad for Hillary Clinton. And that plays right into what Greg is saying. The vast majority of what he said was campaign fodder for Donald Trump. And then the one to two minutes of, by the way, we found all that. We're not recommending any sort of action, which I think is -- ridiculous.PERINO: And then a strange thing, Juan, is that is really not his role, so --GUILFOYLE: No.PERINO: He is the FBI. They provide -- they sent all the -- they finish the investigation and they -- correct me if I'm wrong, Kimberly, then they give it to the prosecutors and they make a decision, but --GUILFOYLE: Yes, correct.PERINO: So basically, Comey took a bullet for the political appointees, so that they didn't have to be the ones to suffer any fallout from it. So, is he the hero the left?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I don't know that he's the hero, I mean James Comey is a republican, but I think that what he did in his mind, I like the way that you pose the question to Greg. I think he felt he was taking responsibility and, you know, picking up on what Greg said, I think that when he -- what he did was he thought, look, I'm giving you the entire record which indicates that Hillary Clinton behaved recklessly with classified or secure information, but I don't think that there is any evidence that she was disloyal to the United States, intended, intended to send classified information or somehow intentionally mishandled classified information. Therefore --GUILFOYLE: Which --WILLIAMS: In terms of the standard for prosecution, he said, ""It's never been done before without these elements and I don't see it's going to be done.""GUILFOYLE: But that's just not true. There is like 12 to 13 instances where, in fact, it has been done. And in fact, it's irrelevant whether she intended to or not because quite simply, that is not the standard of proof that it requires.WILLIAMS: Well, I think that's what James Comey said, so that's all --GUILFOYLE: No. he would say --WILLIAMS: All I'm reporting.GUILFOYLE: I think it's because you don't derail a presidential nominee .WILLIAMS: That's a good point.GUILFOYLE: . the presumptive nominee .WILLIAMS: So I was --GUILFOYLE: . at the party, unless what? He has clear and convincing? But that's changing the game.WILLIAMS: Well, no.GUILFOYLE: That's changing the rules of evidence .PERINO: And not his rule.GUILFOYLE: . and the stand down of proof.WILLIAMS: Well, it's not my --GUILFOYLE: Yeah, and it's out of bounds.WILLIAMS: it might not be his goals, but there's --GUILFOYLE: But they should have given him a stand down order because it's the prosecutor call.WILLIAMS: ""The Wall Street Journal"" said something very fascinating this morning in the editorial page, they said, basically, maybe Comey did this because he wants to spare the country a Trump presidency, but that's not his role.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: But they also said that let's just been -- just be honest about it.WILLIAMS: Yeah, let's be blind (ph). That's what they said.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But I will say this that, what I think is, the mistake now is that they're going to put Comey in the box.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: Instead of going after Hillary now, it's going after Comey.GUTFELD: Exactly.WILLIAMS: And you're going to say, oh, Mr. Comey show me internals of these FBI investigations. My God, you're gonna raise the ghost to J. Edgar Hoover. All of a sudden, you politicizing FBI files.GUTFELD: Yes, he did. He -- it's frustrating, you have this gift. And the republicans may have, may shoot the gift giver.PERINO: They always over --GUTFELD: They overreach.PERINO: They overreach and then they look bad --GUTFELD: Focus on the facts.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: Don't start shooting around the room.GUILFOYLE: No grandstanding.BOLLING: Let's put back on that a little bit, and he also is the guy. Look, I know he's wonderful, above reproach in most instances, but he is the guy who decided after, how many? Thousands -- count, tens of thousands of hours, a hundred and fifty or so FBI investigators, Comey through tens of thousands of e-mails. They're working hard. They think they find 200 smoking guns or a thousand smoking guns where she has lied, saying, ""I don't -- I never sent a classified e-mail,"" but she has on several thousand occasions. And then he says, ""We're not going to recommend you go further,"" --WILLIAMS: He said --BOLLING: Wait a minute. I just spent the last seven, eight months of my life finding this and you go, we're not going to do anything with it?WILLIAMS: Right. He said -- well, he said a few, not thousand, and --BOLLING: No, no. He said 200 e-mails .WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: . are classified .WILLIAMS: Well not thousands.BOLLING: . at the highest level.WILLIAMS: Remember, we're talking about .BOLLING: And 2,000 .WILLIAMS: . tens of thousands o pages.BOLLING: . were classified as the next higher.WILLIAMS: Ten of thousands of pages of e-mails.BOLLING: It is on thousands, Juan.WILLIAMS: So what he said is, ""There was no intent to break the law.""PERINO: But that is --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I have to say that's a pretty -- it's kind of frustrating to me -- to hear that because I did have FBI Top Secret clearance for a long time. I was privileged to do and I took it very seriously. And you don't have to have intent. That's what -- I remember that briefing like it was yesterday, because you have to take it so seriously to sign on the dotted line like you understand that if you mishandle this will information .GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: . at a minimum, you'll be stripped of your security clearance. So I think the other gifts that Comey gave to the republicans if they already use it correctly is that, once again, you have the Clintons acting like they are above law, and in this case, they are --GUTFELD: Yeah, you know --PERINO: Above the law.GUTFELD: The Clintons are like a giant mud puddle at a bus stop. You don't want to stand near them. And it doesn't matter who you are .GUILFOYLE: You got splat.GUTFELD: . because Comey is a good person. And we said this, Lynch is a good person, but you can't look at them the same anymore because they got splattered by Clinton mud, and that doesn't come off easily.BOLLING: Do you think she signed .PERINO: True.BOLLING: . the same document that you did?PERINO: Hillary Clinton?BOLLING: Yeah.PERINO: I believe. And actually, I think that that was produced .GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: . and released by the State department.BOLLING: So she did sign that document. Isn't there a case to be made?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . that she violated that document?GUILFOYLE: Well, that's why I don't think this is over.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And her security clearance should be --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah, because there should be an administrative hearing to revoke the security clearances like Paul Ryan. And like Marco Rubio was calling for today, earlier, when I interviewed him, saying listen, these people, all of them that are part of her staff; Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. All of these people should be subjected to having their security clearances revoked.BOLLING: And if she sign --GUILFOYLE: And you heard Paul Ryan say --BOLLING: And if she sign --GUILFOYLE: Yeah, well --BOLLING: There -- why not.PERINO: I believe the State Department released that last year.BOLLING: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: The other thing that bother me was in, when Comey talked about how she would use her mobile devices inappropriately in countries that are .GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: . hostile us to. And I was remembering when we went to Russia, and I think it was 2007, the secret service told us, ""You gonna have to leave your BlackBerrys on Air Force One. And you should have seen all of us like -- how can we possible do our jobs if we leave our BlackBerrys here? And it was like giving up your security blanket -- literally, and -- but we did it, because that information doesn't belong to us. It belongs to the nation. So we all took out the batteries, gave it to the secret service, left the phones on the plane and we were able to survive just fine. But if we hadn't done that, we had defied the secret service and done that. We -- at a minimum stripped of our clearances.GUTFELD: And, of course, they tell you how to dress in certain countries. So you do --(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: So you are kept safe from the (inaudible), you know, who believe that you must dress like this, but then can you have your, your BlackBerry is completely vulnerable.WILLIAMS: So they're going to keep this going all summer, you guys think, right? Because they got recess coming up, he wants to have hearings so there are going to be hearings in judiciary, hearings and oversight. It just is going to go on. You know what?GUILFOYLE: But it's also the Clinton Foundation that you have a problem with.WILLIAMS: The danger is people are just going to be like, you know .PERINO: Yup.WILLIAMS: . republicans, they are doing another Benghazi.GUTFELD: No, I'd like --WILLIAMS: They just can't let go.GUTFELD: No, but you are -- you were right if they -- if they shoot all over the place. But if they focus on Hillary and just say, you know, she wasn't indicted in court but, boy, Comey indicted her in the court of public opinion.WILLIAMS: OK.GUTFELD: Her character, her trustworthiness. She -- if you just focus on one thing.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: She's unfit to be president because she was as, as a secretary of state put the country at risk. That's all you need.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And she thinks she's better than you.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: And don't forget.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Benghazi created the e-mails .GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: . issue, with e-mails issue may create open the door for some Clinton Foundation.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: So yes, stay on it.GUILFOYLE: And maybe Loretta is not gonna file the charges.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And --GUILFOYLE: November, a decision may be made. That's a fact.PERINO: And you know we're staying on it.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: Into the next block, too.GUTFELD: No, no, no, no. We're not.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: We're now going to move on to the next topic.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Because as can you imagine, Donald Trump has a lot to say about the outcome of the FBI investigation. Kimberly spoke with him a short while ago and you're going to hear that conversation, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: The FBI cleared Hillary Clinton of criminal wrongdoing and Donald Trump is convinced it was the administration's plan all along.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Today is the best evidence ever that we've seen that our system is absolutely totally rigged. Like a criminal with a guilty conscience, Clinton had her lawyers delete, destroy, and wipe away forever. Thirty thousand e-mails. This again, this qualifies her from service. She said today that we may consider the attorney general to go forward. That's like a bribe, isn't it? Isn't it sort of a bribe?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I think it's a bribe.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: While I interviewed the presumptive republican nominee, a few hours ago and he agrees with House Speaker Paul Ryan and others that Clinton should not be granted access to classified information after she becomes the nominee.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think that she certainly is not trustworthy. She lies to give her information that so vital to the country. How can you possibly do it? Her aides are under tremendous suspicion right now. I don't see how you can give her confidential and very important information. She's not a trustworthy person.GUILFOYLE: And --TRUMP: And by the way, you speak about temperament, she's got a horrendous temperament. She would be a terrible president. She would be an absolute -- this will be four more years of Obama, and probably worse.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: No, Greg.GUTFELD: That's the best -- you know the best part about that was.GUILFOYLE: What?GUTFELD: Just watching you.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Oh, OK. Thanks creepy guy across the table from me.GUTFELD: It was a compliment.GUILFOYLE: Oh, would -- oh, thank you.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I think it's very sweet of you. Thank you so much. I was like --GUTFELD: No, he was so stoic (ph).(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: No, he was so stoic (ph).GUILFOYLE: Perfectly still. Perfectly still with great posture from us being Bluebirds and the --PERINO: That's right.GUTFELD: I was a Bluebird.GUILFOYLE: I'll count on that.GUILFOYLE: So Dana --(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: You are kind around with Bluebird.GUILFOYLE: Let's talk a little bit about this in terms of the optics for the Republican Party communicating, getting the message out. You saw the RNC trying to make the most of this. And then Trump, of course, using this opportunity to really hit Hillary hard because he's been calling her lyin', he's been calling her crooked to say that the system is rigged.PERINO: Yeah, I would use -- I think the most effective thing for Donald Trump to do is to use FBI Director Comey's words and quote those words over and over again. I think that he got on the right tracks today. I think last night, you know, going after Saddam Hussein and things like that, like that gets you off message and didn't have a great weekend that way, but today it sort of back on track. I don't love the teleprompter thing, but I think that he was getting closer to hitting on that mark. The other thing I would do is to say, to me, it's very clear. There is right versus wrong. And it's black and white when it comes to the nation's secrets, right? And I'll be for you. I would work for you on behalf of the people. It will not be about me. That would be an effective thing to say.GUILFOYLE: Bolling, what is the messaging here?BOLLING: I hear some message. Donald Trump, I go, you know, I started this campaign as an outsider. I'm an outsider. What you just saw the democrats do is total inside Washington, inside politics .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . corrupt, pay to play. Hand in your pocket. I'll promise you a judgeship or whatever. Supreme Court if you just look the other way if he, if he decides to indict. He didn't. It's unbelievable how corrupt it appears to the average American right now.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: Whether it's corrupt or not, most people who watch and go, you know what? It doesn't sound right. It doesn't look right. The timeline is incredible. Bill meets Loretta Lynch on the tarmac, eight, nine days ago. Three days ago, the FBI meets Hillary Clinton. One day ago, it's all acquitted -- the recommendation is not to, not to indict. It's just -- it (inaudible).GUILFOYLE: And next thing you know, Hillary Clinton is standing at the podium with the presidential seal, Juan, next to President Obama and he said that .PERINO: She has great timing.GUILFOYLE: . she had the most qualified person to ever run for president.WILLIAMS: Well, I have to say, I'm listening to Eric. And I think Eric, you're not giving your guy good advice. Because when he starts talking about -- this is a conspiracy? And that, oh, he's -- she's bribing Loretta Lynch and that Comey is for -- it's like some kind of a stoop, you know, for Hillary Clinton and everybody. And when he's talking about Saddam Hussein, it's kind of -- he's not a bad guy, because he went after the terrorists. And poor Bernie Sanders, where is Bernie Sanders? I think, man .BOLLING: My advice is --WILLIAMS: . you are way, way, way off .BOLLING: My advice was --WILLIAMS: . way off of Hillary Clinton.BOLLING: My advice was to stay on this and look on the outsider, that's inside politics .PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: Well, no.BOLLING: . that you see.WILLIAMS: You know why it doesn't work?BOLLING: I'm not part of that.WILLIAMS: Because then it opens the door for Hillary to come back and say, oh yeah, I let go 55,000 pages of e-mails. Where are your tax returns?GUILFOYLE: Oh, oh really?WILLIAMS: Oh, I don't see your tax returns --GUILFOYLE: What about all the e-mails that she deleted and that her lawyers went through .WILLIAMS: Well, that's more on to say --GUILFOYLE: . and deleted, and then they cleaned their devices. So Comey sat there and said, ""Don't know what was there because we couldn't get access to it.""WILLIAMS: What doesn't --GUILFOYLE: Because they made sure that it wasn't recoverable.WILLIAMS: Well, so you could --GUILFOYLE: I mean, that is --WILLIAMS: It seems to me if you say, oh, gee whiz, where are your taxes? Oh, what about these casinos and the bankruptcies? What about not paying your debts to people? All people say, well, gee, I don't know. Now it's like who is to be believed? But if you really stick to Hillary on the judgment issue, I think it might have some. But at this business about conspiracies and Jim Comey is a bad guy and Loretta Lynch has been bribe? I think people think you know what?GUTFELD: This is --WILLIAMS: This is madness.GUTFELD: What you're saying is exactly with Benghazi. You stick to who pushed the video and you're OK with this; Trump has got stay away from the conspiracies. He's got the golden goose in Hillary. Comey is your homey. Everything he says --GUILFOYLE: Oh.GUTFELD: Everything he says helps you, but you don't need the other stuff. You don't need --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: You know, you don't need to, you know, to dress it up anymore than it is. And the danger is that Hillary's life preserver will become Trump by going off on (inaudible). She's got to focus. This is the biggest gift to him. It's like, you know, she -- Comey gave Hillary on a silver platter.GUILFOYLE: Correct.GUTFELD: Don't drink from the faucet.GUILFOYLE: By just using it to say it's just, you know, is rigged. Look at the outcome here.GUTFELD: That's helpful.GUILFOYLE: It was predictive in terms of, you know, that this would happen. And there is some cause to say, look at the conflict of interest here.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: You know Loretta Lynch was appointed, originally, by Bill Clinton. He's on a plane with her. Nobody talks about the grandkids for 35 minutes like that with oh, let me go. Let's find the AG just --GUTFELD: They're awesome grandkids.GUILFOYLE: . use this.WILLIAMS: You know if you guys --GUILFOYLE: Oh, OK.WILLIAMS: Let me say, if the republicans had Kasich, if you had Bush, if -- I don't care who you had, but you got Trump and it's just hard to make the case against Clinton if you're looking at Donald Trump and his bankruptcies and it's refused that they released tax returns.BOLLING: Well -- OK.GUILFOYLE: OK.BOLLING: Donald Trump beat Kasich include -- and Bush.WILLIAMS: I noticed. And I just, I just thinking -- at this point you are thinking --GUTFELD: And he praised Saddam, which I thought was very brave.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Very brave.WILLIAMS: OK.GUTFELD: Blame Bush for 9/11 and praise Saddam. He's got my vote.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: I'm sure you (inaudible).WILLIAMS: Oh.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Can I go home now?(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Can I go home?GUILFOYLE: Juan, yes.WILLIAMS: Oh my, God.BOLLING: Yes?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: I will second that (ph).(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Next, did President Obama put pressure on the FBI to clear Hillary Clinton? Were we talking about that? He says he didn't. But he publicly stated how he thought the investigation should turn out; that flashback -- ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: She lied about sending and receiving top secret information. She lied to the FBI was only conducting a security review. She lied that she only used one device to e-mail. She lied that her server definitely wasn't hacked. We now know for sure that Hillary Clinton bracingly put her national security at risk. So what does that make here according to the president of the United States? The most qualified candidate in American history, of course.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hillary Clinton has been tested.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: She has seen up close to what is involved in making those decisions. She has seen the consequences of things working well and things not working well. And there has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office than Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: Ever.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: You can't make this up. Who wrote that script for him to say that?GUTFELD: He knows --BOLLING: The most qualified?GUTFELD: Well, he said any man or woman and that's very, very heteronormative, because that was -- it's just there are other choices. Also, she's been tested, for what?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: What has she been tested for, measles? I don't know. And he also didn't specify what office. He said, she would -- it was, she was more qualified in this office, but he really didn't say which office --BOLLING: That's right. He was in North Carolina, (inaudible) North Carolina.PERINO: Yes.BOLLING: Maybe the office of the Of the DMV's office --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Could have been the DMV.BOLLING: Yes, or the DMV's.GUILFOYLE: Oh my, gosh. The leader --GUTFELD: I was trying to help him now.GUILFOYLE: The leader-in-chief? No. No. Can you actually -- can you imagine the leading all the DMV information -- very problematic.GUTFELD: That would help me.GUILFOYLE: I don't think so.GUTFELD: Believe me.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Get a license.GUILFOYLE: Exactly.BOLLING: Should be the most disqualified.GUILFOYLE: And it's kind of a dis to himself, isn't it? I mean, because all I kept saying to myself is a community organizer. Told you. That was the problem. And he said that she's more qualified.GUTFELD: The bar is so low that even Dana can't walk under it.BOLLING: Very nice, very nice.Juan, what makes her -- what makes her the most qualified?WILLIAMS: Boy, I mean, I don't know where to start. The woman's been -- she was a United States senator. But in addition, she's been secretary of state. She spent eight years in the White House as first lady. Right?BOLLING: That's experience, but not qualifying.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. We're talking about qualifications, right? What you put on a resume. You asked me what makes her the most qualified? I'm answering the question.I mean, in addition to which, of course, the years she spent with her husband while he was governor of Arkansas. And she has been a private lawyer and successful as a private lawyer. So I think that she's eminently qualified.What you guys are talking about and mocking, I understand is she displayed reckless judgment, according to the FBI director.GUTFELD: Exactly.BOLLING: So Dana, can I...GUILFOYLE: Thank you, Juan.BOLLING: ... take Juan's very, very long resume that he portrayed? Qualify -- experience equals qualified?PERINO: I mean, you've had, like -- if you look at the range of candidates that the Republicans had in the primary this year, 17 of them, lots of different types of experience. We are going to -- we have a nominee that is outside the box, outside Washington. And that actually became, in the exit polls, the most important quality for Republican voters in the primary, was that they wanted somebody from outside of Washington.So I don't know if the qualifications...BOLLING: Right, so...PERINO: ... that Juan just listed actually are the ones that Americans are actually looking for.BOLLING: It's a different job description. Maybe people are looking for the outsider, which would make him the most qualified.PERINO: Can I add one other thing?BOLLING: Yes.PERINO: Well, I just want to say that, if you -- to take a moment and realize, President Obama is a huge asset to her on this campaign trail. There is one of the B-roll from the crowd was amazing. But there's a shot from the A.P. of -- a photograph of all these people, oversold crowd, right? With their hands up in the air, taking pictures of the president and Hillary Clinton so that they could get a look. There is enthusiasm. He's one of the first two-term presidents that is going to actually be active on the campaign trail. It's a huge net plus for her.GUTFELD: It's got to drive her crazy. They like her. They like him. And then she's up there and, like, ""meh.""WILLIAMS: By the way, Dana. Let me just ask Dana. Dana, just tell the audience his approval numbers, just in case they missed it.BOLLING: It's good.PERINO: It's like 53 percent.BOLLING: Stay right there, because you came up with the right term I was looking for. President Obama guaranteed there be would no political influence on the FBI's investigation, but he sent signals as to what the outcome should be. Here's what the president said on FOX News back in April.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Hillary Clinton was an outstanding secretary of state. She would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America's national security. Now what I've also said is that -- and she's acknowledged -- that there's -- there's a carelessness in terms of managing e-mails that she has owned and she recognizes.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Now Dana, you came up with the right analogy. It's called what?PERINO: Working the ref.BOLLING: Did he do that?PERINO: Yes. And in fact, actually, I think that, if you pulled up THE FIVE's show from the day that we talked about the president's interview there, that we said the same thing. That it wasn't just our words. It was the FBI on background was saying, ""Mr. President, please stop. We don't need your help. You're going to sully the investigation. If you try to put your thumb on the scale, you're going to cause a problem for us.""BOLLING: Sure.GUILFOYLE: It's improper. You shouldn't comment on a pending investigation. But do you love the little buzz words, the little phrases you heard?BOLLING: Careless.GUILFOYLE: Careless.BOLLING: Careless.GUILFOYLE: Careless. And that she would never intentionally, but she was careless. It came right out of the Comey script.BOLLING: Comey said, right? Excessively careless. What did he say? Excessively careless?GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: Excessively.GUTFELD: Extremely.GUILFOYLE: Extremely careless.WILLIAMS: The president just had the right analysis.BOLLING: Or -- OK, he's very prescient.WILLIAMS: No, I'm just saying it's the same analysis that Comey eventually delivered.BOLLING: The point is, he should spend more time on FOX News and be more prescient so we know what to expect.GUILFOYLE: The same messaging, you know, verbatim. Hello. That's just more evidence of this.BOLLING: Are we good to go?GUTFELD: Yes, I'm fine.BOLLING: All right. Let's go now.GUILFOYLE: Go to ISIS.BOLLING: ISIS extended its global wave of terror during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, launching attacks in eight countries that have killed literally hundreds. According to our State Department, it's a sure sign that we're winning the war, right? We'll try and figure that one out later.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: A rescued hostage at the Holey Artisan Bakery said those who he could recite a verse from the Koran were spared, the others, tortured and killed. This amidst other grim events: in Istanbul; the Tel Aviv attack where maniacs planned to dip their knives in rat poison. Suicide bombers hit three Saudi cities; a grenade attack in Malaysia. The worst, in Baghdad: 200 were killed when a truck packed with explosives blew up in a shopping hub where victims were celebrating. That's more than Paris and Orlando combined, all during Ramadan.But by the numbers, Muslim victims outnumber non-Muslims. So if Islamists kill more Muslims than anyone, why accuse Americans of Islamophobia? Isn't it the Islamists who are Islamophobic?I say this as people criticize our outrage for mentioning Islam with terror. But how can our outrage offend them when we are outraged for them. But as this holy period ends -- thank Allah -- no doubt, Islamists will find other reasons to kill Muslims. Homosexuality, learning to drive, blasphemy -- the Sharia don't like it, mocking the old law.Terror cells are now in Europe and at least 17 ISIS militants have infiltrated there, disguised as refugees. Yet, our State Department claims the recent attacks, they're signs of desperation:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANTONY BLINKEN, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE: We're seeing, I think, is ISIS actually lashing out, because against every way we measure this -- the territory they control, the number of foreign fighters and fighters overall, the money, the propaganda -- they are down against every single measure. And unfortunately, one of the things that they do in response is to lash out with these indiscriminate terrorist attacks. In a strange way, this is a measure of the success we're having in taking their territory away from them, taking the foreign fighters away, taking the resources away.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Call that whistling in the dark: Seeing the widening scope of terrorism and the self-activation of sleeper cells as some sort of success. If that's progress in the war against terror, imagine what failure would be.Juan, the sooner we eradicate ISIS and kill all Islamist terrorists, the better it is for Muslims, no?WILLIAMS: I think it -- I don't see that there's any dispute there. I was listening to you so intently, because I think that what Mr. Blinken said is accurate. That they have less territory, less fighters, less money and that they are, therefore, resorting to guerrilla warfare-type tactics, which means that they go out and they, say, especially during Ramadan, as you pointed out last week, go and do something you know. ""You lone wolves. It doesn't take our instruction. Go do it.""So we can take away their control and command. We can take out their leaders, and we've been doing a good job of it. But it -- the result is the sad horrible consequence because of their terrible, cancerous ideology that's being spread even as they're going down.GUILFOYLE: Yes, and guess what? ISIS is doing more with less. How about that? How horrifying. They're actually increasing body counts and their expectations with less resources. That tells you how deadly they are. It tells you how flawed our campaign and strategy is against ISIS. Because they are managing, almost on a daily basis, to hit hard internationally so no soil is safe, whether it's Muslim soil or American soil. They continue to bleed everybody out.I feel worse now.BOLLING: But there's a silver lining, according to Juan, in the Obama administration, we're this close to defeating them. We almost got them. You know, a little more love. Loretta Lynch says a little more love and maybe they'll go down.WILLIAMS: No other question. To my mind, I was listening to Kimberly there, is that we are destroying their capacity to build this caliphate that they say they want to build. OK? And so what they do now is they go out and they commit these horrific crimes.BOLLING: What's worse?WILLIAMS: Well, that's the question. Because what Kimberly was saying is do you have a strategy?BOLLING: Because if this is winning, what's to lose?WILLIAMS: Kimberly says do you have a strategy? And my thought was it's hard to come up with a strategy when you can just say to people, ""Oh, yes,"" especially during Ramadan, ""this is a time to go for Allah and go kill people and even kill other Muslims in greater numbers than you're killing Christians.""BOLLING: Can I also point out one thing also?GUILFOYLE: Solution: Crush them and destroy them and burn them alive in Raqqah. That's what you do. That's what McCain said to do.WILLIAMS: But even if you do, even if you destroy them, they -- the ideology continues to percolate.BOLLING: Scholars will tell you, if you're a, quote unquote, ""moderate Muslim"" and you turn in a Muslim who has a jihad, who's about to perform a jihad, you can be considered the enemy, as well. The infidel, as well. And maybe during Ramadan, no moderate Muslim who sees or hears something will say something.GUTFELD: Yes. Let me -- I'm going to roll to this. This is President Obama talking about ISIS infiltrating Europe. I believe that's the SOT.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Even as we work for peace, we have to deal with the realities of the world as it is. And we can't forget what's at stake in Afghanistan. This is where al Qaeda is trying to regroup. This is where ISIL continues to try to expand its presence. If these terrorists succeed in regaining areas in camps where they can train and plot, they will attempt more attacks against us. We cannot allow that to happen.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So the president today is basically saying, ""When I said we were going to end the war in Afghanistan, I'm going to have to backtrack on that, because my mistake of leaving in Iraq too soon led to the situation we have now, and not enforcing the red line in Syria led to the international crisis of the refugees infiltrating Europe.""GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: And I think what -- what Mr. Blinken was talking about sounds really good at the Council on Foreign Relations.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And everybody sits there and nods and drinks their coffee and says, ""Oh, that was such a great speech. Thank you so much.""To the rest of us, we're thinking, wait, if they're doing more with less and killing more of us with less structure, how much worse can it get? And I think the role of the government has to be to have an imagination and to think ahead.So if you allow Assad to stay there, and then ISIS has a safe haven to plot and plan attacks, it doesn't matter if you cut off the heads. Because they adapted. We have to adapt, too.President Obama is going to leave troops in Afghanistan but not, I don't think, give them enough of what they need to win. And I don't think it will be enough, and they're not going to change the rules of engagement.GUILFOYLE: And just like the problems that we had in Iraq, where they didn't have the proper status of forces agreement and not enough troops to be able to sustain, maintain order and help our partners.PERINO: And while they say that ISIS has less territory, the Taliban has much, much more.GUILFOYLE: Resurgence in Afghanistan, as well, another crisis. Well done.GUTFELD: All right. Great news.Breaking news on Donald Trump's V.P. search when ""The Five"" returns.GUILFOYLE: (UNINTELLIGIBLE)BOLLING: I don't know.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Less than two weeks away from the Republican National Convention, and boy, the buzz about Donald Trump's V.P. pick, it's intensifying. And it's not going to be Tennessee Senator Bob Corker. He withdrew himself from consideration today, and so did Iowa Senator Joni Ernst. Ernst says she wants to focus on her work in the state.Meanwhile, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Indiana governor Mike Pence, they are still on the short list.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: This is all up to Donald Trump. He'll pick who he wants. He'll pick it based on what he wants, both to win the election and to govern.GOV. MIKE PENCE (R), INDIANA: Well, look, let me say, we had a great time. It was such a privilege for us to be able to spend time with a man that I hope will be the next president of the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Kimberly tried to get the scoop from Donald Trump earlier.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP (via phone): I'm actually looking at 10 people, and there or four called me up. Very big names: Senate and governors and all. And they want to be considered, and we're looking very, very strongly.I like the generals. I like the concept of the generals. We're thinking about -- actually, there are two of them that are under consideration. We really were looking to go more the political route, in terms of getting legislation passed, which is what they do. And I think, frankly, we don't want to do the executive orders, like Obama's been doing. He just sits down, signs executive orders all day long. That's not the way it's supposed to work. So...(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Hmm.WILLIAMS: Well, Kimberly...GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: ... you talked to him, so what did you take away?GUILFOYLE: And that's what you do with Mr. Trump. You let him talk, right? I mean, you do. You let him talk, because he's very open with giving information. And what I thought was very interesting today was he said the list has expanded to ten people. This is even in light of the news of Corker and Ernst withdrawing themselves from consideration. I don't think they were going to be the pick anyway, to begin with. But definitely people of high caliber to be considered amongst that group of esteemed individuals.WILLIAMS: Well, but Eric, I thought, in fact, he was trying to seduce Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, because it would help him. He had Corker on his big jet yesterday. He had him at the event in North Carolina.GUILFOYLE: He introduced him.WILLIAMS: And Corker said he was awed by the Trump crowd, but then he says, ""I'm not doing it. I don't want...""BOLLING: Yes, he said not doing it. Also, Donald Trump, the rumor was that General Michael Flynn was one of the people on the short list, as well, but you heard Donald tell Kimberly he pushed away from the generals; he wants the political.Look, I think Newt Gingrich gives him...GUILFOYLE: That's two on the list.BOLLING: Newt gives him very inside politics. That's the area that he -- you know, he comes from the outside, so he wants to be able to have some sort of -- I don't know -- success inside Washington.I like Newt. I think he's wonderful; he's brilliant. But I also think Marco Rubio gives him Florida, which I think he desperately needs. I know he doesn't want to do it. but you never know, unless -- until you're asked.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: But you don't want to get embarrassed by being turned down.BOLLING: Well, you don't do it in public.GUILFOYLE: You wouldn't -- Juan...WILLIAMS: That's what happened -- that's what happened with Corker.BOLLING: Remember when you went to prom?WILLIAMS: Me?BOLLING: Yes. You didn't ask a girl to prom...GUILFOYLE: You don't ask them until you do a little advance work to find out it's a yes.WILLIAMS: Yes. Well, anyway, someone who is picking up is Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Dana. What do you think?PERINO: Well, again, I think that, when -- when you go to pick -- sorry. First day back from vacation. When you go to pick somebody as your vice president, what is the most important thing to consider? Is you have to have somebody that can govern.And that doesn't have to be a governor. It doesn't have to be a senator, necessarily, but it has to be somebody that can step in and fill the role in the event that you're unable to perform your duties as the commander in chief.So I actually don't think it's going to be anybody that we've heard about so far. I think Donald Trump likes a surprise and that we should all be prepared that it's somebody that you haven't heard of yet.WILLIAMS: So Greg, give me your pick for Donald Trump.GUTFELD: Still waiting for the call.GUILFOYLE: Yes, by the way.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Go about your daily activities.WILLIAMS: Hey, wait a second.GUTFELD: I hear through the grapevine he wants to reach out, but he's just a little scared. And it's OK; you can call me, Donald.But I think -- I still think that Newt is the big one. Because you need somebody to navigate...GUILFOYLE: Biden likes him.GUTFELD: ... D.C., the turf which, you know, Trump isn't familiar with. But I came up with two headlines for ""The New York Post."" For Corker, ""Uncorked."" And if Pence doesn't do it, ""Ex-Pence.""GUILFOYLE: OK.WILLIAMS: Well, I say Gutfeld for vice president.GUTFELD: There you go.WILLIAMS: ""One More Thing,"" up next.GUTFELD: I'm in.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" I'll go quickly. President George W. Bush turned 70 today. Happy birthday to him. I think we -- he spent the day mountain biking with some wounded warriors, like he's down on his ranch in Crawford, Texas. And I just want to wish him a very, very happy birthday.BOLLING: Excellent.WILLIAMS: Happy birthday.GUILFOYLE: Happy birthday.PERINO: And that's a picture his daughter posted today, and she looks beautiful.GUILFOYLE: Very nice.PERINO: Greg, you're next.GUTFELD: All right, roll that thing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Crime Corner(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Now roll the music, please.(MUSIC: THEME FROM ""CHiPS"")GUTFELD: All right. Great news. Erik Estrada -- keep playing it. Erik Estrada, Ponch -- remember Ponch? -- actually has now joined a real police force in Idaho. He's a reserve officer in Idaho.PERINO: That's awesome.GUTFELD: He'll be fighting -- he'll be fighting online predators who seek out children.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my...GUTFELD: I think you can -- that's a good thing to do, right?PERINO: Absolutely.BOLLING: He was ""CHiPS,"" right? Now he's ""IPS.""GUTFELD: Yes, he's ""IPS."" Nicely done. All right.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness.GUTFELD: From ""CHiPS"" to ""IPS.""PERINO: All right. Juan Williams.GUILFOYLE: I'd stay out of Idaho, Greg.WILLIAMS: So, you know, last weekend, Fourth of July weekend, you know, I wanted to go watch the fireworks in Washington, so I got permission to go up to the top of the National Cathedral...PERINO: Wow.WILLIAMS: ... the highest point in the city, and took my family. And but guess what?GUILFOYLE: Rain.WILLIAMS: It was so overcast, so much rain we didn't see a thing. But you know what? There's some of my family.But I've got to tell you something. Being at the top of the National Cathedral, stunning. You should do this one. I don't think you can do it in the public, but it's an awesome experience to be at the top and see America from that perspective.PERINO: All right. K.G.GUILFOYLE: Beautiful. His, like, ""One More Things"" are very good.GUTFELD: Not yours.GUILFOYLE: Unlike mine today. So ""Kimberly's Food Court.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: Kimberly's Food Court(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: I could be super excited, but I'm not, because apparently it was also fried chicken day or something, right? Oh, no. We have kale. So here's the deal.Kale is going to be the big hit in this eating contest, and it's going to be in the food festival in New York this Saturday, July 9 at 2 p.m. in front of Buffalo City Hall. Kale eating contest, OK?GUTFELD: No one's going.GUILFOYLE: OK, people are. There are going to be ten competitors. People that are going to be featured: Eric ""Badlands"" Booker, ""Crazy Legs"" Conti and ""Buffalo"" Jim Reeves. You will not see me there because of this.PERINO: Oh, man. K.G., you're brave.GUTFELD: Terrible.PERINO: All right. Eric, you go next.BOLLING: Can I go very quickly? In the break, my publisher just called and say we made The New York Times best-seller list.GUTFELD: Nice.BOLLING: No. 7 hard cover.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, we are broadcasting live from Trump Tower in New York City.Now, it was a big night for Donald Trump in the Empire State. Now, Fox News is now projecting that Trump will win the New York GOP primary. Ohio governor John Kasich is coming in second place. Senator Ted Cruz -- he will come in third.And joining us now -- by the way, on the Democratic side, though, first, FOX News is projecting Hillary Clinton will win the New York Democratic primary, beating socialist Bernie Sanders.Joining us now are some of the Donald Trump's children. Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and Tiffany Trump. Guys, good to see you. How are you?ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S SON: Great to be with you, Sean.DONALD TRUMP, JR., DONALD TRUMP'S SON: Great to be with you.HANNITY: This is the first time we've met, so nice to see you.TIFFANY TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER: I know, so happy to meet you.HANNITY: Big night, obviously. We don't know what the delegate count is going to be, but numbers I've been seeing up to now, almost near 60 percent or above. If he gets 50 percent in every district and wins the state, you can win as many as 95 delegates tonight.D. TRUMP: Well, we're very excited. Listen, it's a big night. It's -- there's no place like home, as they say, right? So we knew we were going to do well here. I think so far, based on what I'm seeing and what you're seeing simultaneously, it's a bigger win than we even imagined, and it's going to be a great week.HANNITY: Yes. What do you make of all the issues in the last two weeks about delegates? For example, in states like Georgia, South Carolina, places that were kind of long forgotten.D. TRUMP: Yes. Well, it's amazing. When you let the voters vote, we do incredibly well. You know, when you try to suppress that, it's a different system.That system made sense 200 years ago, Sean, 150 years ago, when people lived on a farm. They didn't have the Library of Congress on their fingertips, on their on iPhones. They didn't have the access to information. It no longer does.We have to let the American people decide. I mean, it's actually a joke.  I feel like I'm in communist China sometimes watching this stuff. You know, it's crazy. When the American people get to vote, we win.HANNITY: I think there's a certainty for reform. The Democrats are even worse because they have this whole superdelegate system.D. TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: But I always think, all right, if it's a national party, the people represent the party. So you should have either a caucus or a primary. Let the people participate, every person that wants to. You can be proportional or winner-take-all. And I think every delegate should be bound.Are you upset about the process and what's been happening in terms of states that have already taken place?E. TRUMP: Well, listen, I think people are seeing it for the first time.  I mean, they're really seeing the delegate system, how unfair it is. I mean, look at Colorado. Colorado is a perfect example of this. I mean, people didn't get to vote. And you know, as Don just said, I mean, that really isn't democracy.And people are upset about it. I mean, people are upset about it. And the Republican Party, they should want to expand the voter base, right? And doing that, quite frankly, especially to the frontrunner, it does the exact opposite. It has the exact reciprocal effect.HANNITY: This is a record turnout year, too. And Republicans in primaries are way outperforming Democrats from where they were in 2008.E. TRUMP: Well, especially in swing states, right? I mean, one of the things that never gets talked about when they speak about Cruz is we're winning so many of the states that you need in order to win the general election, whether it be Florida. You saw how well we've done so many other places. I mean, look how well we did tonight in New York. Can you imagine if a Republican took the state of New York?HANNITY: It's interesting. Hillary Clinton, the senator here, we didn't project her right at 9:00 o'clock straight up when we came on the air.D. TRUMP: We saw it at 9:00:00:01...(CROSSTALK)D. TRUMP: That was pretty fast. And you know, that's amazing. I mean, the GOP hasn't won New York since '84. I mean, imagine just putting that into play, what that means for the general?HANNITY: Or New Jersey or Pennsylvania.D. TRUMP: The GOP should embrace that. They wouldn't not run from it. But they're worried about someone who's going to shake it up.  They're worried about someone who's going to get rid of their little cadre system, where everyone takes care of everyone else. And there's no accountability, Sean. They can lose, they put forth these terrible candidates. They lose, and guess what? Nothing happens. They have their job. It doesn't matter.HANNITY: What about Reince Priebus, who'll say, Well, everybody knew the rules ahead of time? Should you have competed differently maybe in a state like Colorado?D. TRUMP: No because my father -- he wants to speak to the people. He's given people a voice. He wants to focus on the blue collar, hard-working Americans. The only non-protected class in this country are the people who made this country great, are the people who built this country, and they don't have a voice anymore! He wants to be their voice.  He wants to make sure they're heard.HANNITY: You once said -- I thought one of the more fascinating descriptions of your dad came from you. You once called him on my show a blue collar billionaire.D. TRUMP: 100 percent.HANNITY: That's an interesting line.D. TRUMP: 100 percent. I mean, that's how he is. I mean, you see him just the way he gets along with people, whether it's, you know, the construction workers on our job sites because he's also the only candidate up there who's actually created jobs. Hard to believe.You know, he gets that. He just understands these people so well. He's really one of them. He's been very successful. He's incredibly smart and wealthy. But you know, he's that guy. He's an ordinary American in many respects when you get him on one on one alone.HANNITY: You know, I've talked to you brothers a little bit more than you, Tiffany. And -- but I saw an interesting quote about you fairly recently, where you said that your father's work ethic -- you don't want to underperform. You want to overperform, that he's inspired you. What does that mean?T. TRUMP: I think my father is just someone who motivates all of us, truly. And you know, all of my siblings who work so hard and with the American people, you know, he really is relatable to them.My family in Georgia -- you know, my mom's from Georgia, and everyone is just rooting, rooting for my father, you know, trying to get hats. And we can't even get, like, my -- you know, my closest relatives hats. So it's such a movement and just so amazing to finally seeing, you know, something happening and changing in politics.HANNITY: Did any of you expect this from your father?D. TRUMP: Always. Listen, if there's one thing I've learned in my life, never underestimate him. If he gets into something, he's going to do well. And he's going to do it right.HANNITY: Yes.D. TRUMP: You know, unlike a lot of the other candidates, you know, they win by one vote, and they say, Everyone else should drop out!  Everyone else should drop out! You know, so if Ted Cruz comes in a distant third in New York state. maybe he should think about doing the same thing, Sean.HANNITY: I think the ""New York values"" comment certainly, and our exit polls shows this, that it certainly had an impact on people.Let me talk, though -- let me get back to this delegate issue because this is a very big issue. Mitch McConnell -- I want the delegates to pick somebody who can win. I don't think he's talking about your father. Mitt Romney's talked about it. John Kasich has talked about it. Karl Rove has talked about it, and even state GOP leaders have talked about a white knight candidate.So my question is, if they were to try to disenfranchise the voters, what's your reaction? Where does that go?E. TRUMP: Isn't that ironic, given that he's millions and millions of votes ahead of everybody? I mean, you saw the performance today. You've seen the performance up to today. He was a couple million votes ahead. After the 26th, he'll be many millions of votes even further ahead. I mean, that's amazing.You also see the turnout at the polls. You look at states like Nevada, right, they had the biggest turnout they've ever had. You look at South Carolina. You look at New Hampshire. These states are having the biggest turnouts that they've ever had.You see the amount of people that came to the polls today, Democrats who wanted to vote Republican, who didn't know the rules. They were getting turned away left and right. You see in Pennsylvania, quite frankly, how many people registered -- there were Democrats who registered as Republicans very early.HANNITY: It was almost 100,000.(CROSSTALK)D. TRUMP: Huge numbers, Sean. Why turn those people away? I don't get it!E. TRUMP: I mean, he's growing the base.D. TRUMP: You destroy the party.E. TRUMP: Growing the party. And it's an amazing thing.HANNITY: You know, all right, so the number is 1,237. We still have a lot of contests to go. If your dad -- if it turns out he gets anywhere, I would argue, between 85 to 95 delegates, which it appears he's on track to tonight, that gives him an almost 300-delegate lead heading into states -- Connecticut he's up 20. He's up 20 in Pennsylvania, up 20 in Maryland.  Delaware, Rhode Island both seem to be going in his favor.So now he's going to get a lot of momentum coming out of here. If he fell 37 short in the delegate count and they try to steal it, what happens?D. TRUMP: Oh, I think you destroy the party. I mean, why go through this process if that's going to happen, Sean? They've made people watch how many hundreds of debates at this point? Every day -- I mean, if I see one more countdown clock for an event that doesn't happen for six days and they're counting down -- it's only four days, three hours and 76 seconds! It's ridiculous!If I see one more of those things talking about --HANNITY: That's funny.D. TRUMP: why get people so vested? Why get people so vested if you're going to say, You know what?  (INAUDIBLE) we're going to (INAUDIBLE) we're going to do this! You're going to show up! You're going to and vote! We're going to take a year of your life in terms of news cycle, and then guess what? We were just kidding. We were just kidding, Sean. Your vote doesn't matter.HANNITY: This is a really serious...D. TRUMP: It's crazy!HANNITY: ... issue because...D. TRUMP: You're going to -- you're going to disenfranchise so many voters...HANNITY: This is serious.D. TRUMP:... so many voters on both sides, by the way.HANNITY: Yes.D. TRUMP: On both sides. You're going to destroy the system that we know it.HANNITY: Yes.D. TRUMP: It actually makes a window...(CROSSTALK)D. TRUMP:... for a viable third party, Sean.HANNITY: Think about all the time, effort, energy people go in to caucusing or voting and -- they -- look, they spend time. They watch shows like this. They make an informed decision about who they want to vote for.E. TRUMP: And Sean, look at -- look at Arizona, right? I mean, people were waiting in line for three, four hours in order to vote. So then you tell them that that vote meant nothing and they were just suggesting a candidate? I mean, their vote didn't count for anything, that it was really just more of a suggestion than anything? I mean, that doesn't -- that doesn't work. That's not democracy in play and I think people are seeing that for the first time.HANNITY: There's two issues at play here. I think these are arcane rules that are outdated, need reform. But there's also the other side of the argument, which is, OK, everybody knew the rules going in. What I also don't like is this idea that, OK, people, delegates are committed to, say, your father or Ted Cruz on John Kasich. But then, OK, the other candidates will come in behind your back, go back to those states and what are they offering them...D. TRUMP: They're bribing them! It's bribery!E. TRUMP: That's a crooked system.D. TRUMP: If we did that in business, you go to jail! How does it work in politics?HANNITY: Well, can they pay for hotel room, plane ride and expensive dinners?D. TRUMP: The American people are coming onto it! They're getting -- they understand it and they're disgusted. The amount of people that grab me on the street, the amount of people that today going in to vote, going, like, I can't believe the system, because they weren't even aware of the system. The average voter has no idea that this is going on behind their backs, that their vote really in many respects doesn't even matter! They get it in Colorado. They saw it in Wyoming. And they're disgusted.HANNITY: All right, because I have three of the children here, I got to ask this question because it's important. All right, so who got in trouble the most?(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: You?E. TRUMP: Does that surprise you, Sean?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: No. That's why I get along with him so well because I got in trouble since I was in 1st grade. I got taken home by the cops.(CROSSTALK)D. TRUMP: Barbara Walters asked us that question once. We were all on the air, I think all five kids. And you know, my dad was there, and she started of asking the question. She got about a third of the way through the question, he goes, ""Don."" Next question. It was over!HANNITY: That was it?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: You told me a story once -- you can repeat it here. You told me on my radio show your dad, you're 7 or 8 years old, and he asked you to get him a Coke can and you didn't get it?D. TRUMP: Yes. He came back from a rather rough day at work, and he was, like, ""Listen, run to the kitchen and grab me a Coke."" And I said, you know, I'm not your explicative maid.HANNITY: Oh! Oh!D. TRUMP: I thought I was tough.HANNITY: Oh!D. TRUMP: I thought I was tough. And I've never seen the man move so fast in my life, Sean. It was, like -- I mean, I -- and my mom caught me at the top of the stairs and just handed me to him. And she's that European tough disciplinarian, you know, type. And you know, that was one -- I learned never to do that one again.HANNITY: Did you learn from your brother's mistakes?E. TRUMP: Yes, I did. No, he definitely -- he definitely took a little bit more of that.HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE) blame it on him and they already...(CROSSTALK)E. TRUMP: But honestly, he was such an amazing father. You know, he could not have been a better father. He could not be a better boss to all of us. I mean, sitting in a room here today, I mean, I could not be more proud of the man. He is so fantastic, and it's such a great night...HANNITY: Yes. And how about your brothers? Did they treat you well? They treated you the way you...T. TRUMP: They better treat me well or someone's going to get in trouble, right?D. TRUMP: It's more the boyfriends that have to worry. They have a lot more fear than...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Are they tough on your boyfriends?T. TRUMP: You know, they want to take care of me. So I appreciate it.HANNITY: You appreciate that? All right, well, congratulations. Big night for your dad.T. TRUMP: Thank you so much.HANNITY: Very nice meet you, too. Eric, thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks, Don, appreciate it.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: All right, coming up, Bill Hemmer is standing by at the ""Hannity"" big board tonight. He's going to break down how tonight's results will impact that delegate count out of New York.Also, reaction from Laura Ingraham. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani will join us right here on set.That and more as we continue live tonight from Trump Tower. ""Hannity"" continues on the road.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are going to be so strong again. We are going to be -- really, I mean, legitimately so great again.  And I just can't wait. So we don't have much of a race anymore based on what I'm seeing on television. Senator Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: So we're going to celebrate for about two hours. Then early in the morning, I get up and we begin working again.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, that was Donald Trump speaking earlier tonight after his big win in New York in the Republican primary.And joining us now on set -- well, first, at the ""big board,"" back -- we call it the billboard and the ""Hannity"" big board -- is our own friend, Bill Hemmer.Bill how does it work down with the -- work out with the delegate count at this hour? What do you got?BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We cannot divide delegates for New York state yet, Sean. There is a projection -- Donald Trump's doing really well in New York. Let's make that clear. Will he get all 95 delegates? It's tough to say.There is one projection that's floating out there that may put Trump right around 90 delegates, which would be certainly enormous for his campaign.  It might really change the arc of this race.And I'll tell you why, OK? This is our delegate projection. New York is not on the map. Trump starts tonight at 756. He needs to get to 1,237.  Sean, I'll take you a week from today, right? There's five states. We think he does well in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania.Now we're in the month of May. Indiana's tough to figure. And just as we were listening to Trump last hour, he said tomorrow he goes Indiana and he goes to Pennsylvania. Why is that?Right now, we believe Indiana favors Ted Cruz, so we'll will give that to the Cruz column. Then the week after is Nebraska. We think that winner- take-all favors Cruz. Same day, West Virginia we believe favors Donald Trump.And now we're third week of May, Sean. Oregon's close, so is Washington state. We'll split it up right now. And then you've got the five remaining states on the map.Just follow my scenario, Sean. We believe Cruz is favored in Montana, likewise for South Dakota. We believe New Mexico's 50-50 split between both. We still think California favors Trump with 100 delegates right now out of 172, and we still think he wins winner-take-all in New Jersey.So on this tabulation, he's 157 shy. So then where does he go to look for these delegates? You know, maybe our projection is wrong about Indiana.  The reason I say that is because there's no state polling happening.  There's very little information that would indicate perhaps maybe which way the Hoosier State is going.Maybe Trump goes there and flips Indiana. Now you see those numbers drop again. And then we move into the month of June. Maybe Montana, which is winner-take-all, by the way, and 27 delegates on the line -- maybe Trump does well out there.And you see now where he starts to pick off some delegates. So we're being a little generous right now as we knock down these numbers. I'll give them back to Cruz just for the sake of this argument.One more point. Pennsylvania has 71 delegates, Sean, but they will only award 17 next Tuesday night. 54 will be unbound, which means they can go wherever they want on the first ballot in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 18th.  Those 54 unbound delegates will join about 140 others for a grand total of 170 unbound that will be up for grabs come convention time, if it goes this way.You know, that's just one scenario that we're trying to figure out. I mean, this is guesswork. It is not science for the moment, Sean.HANNITY: You know -- thanks, Bill Hemmer at the billboard, the ""Hannity"" big board. We call it both. We both share it together, but...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: But you can literally break it down. The AP had an article that got Trump to 1,238 this week. All depends on some of these unbound delegates, where they go. Pennsylvania has some very interesting ways in which delegates are ultimately going to be bound to candidates. Many are unbound. You only get 17 for winning the state. Then some 54 are unbound.You have the names of the delegates on the ballot, but not next to the candidate that they're supporting. So it gets pretty complicated.But Bill Hemmer, thank you so much.HEMMER: Indeed, it is. Talk to you a bit later. Thanks.HANNITY: All right, joining us now on set, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani is with us. Mr. Mayor, how are you?RUDY GIULIANI, R-FORMER NYC MAYOR: I'm very good.HANNITY: All right. Obviously a big night for Trump. We don't know the total delegate count, should be between 88 and 95, by the looks of it and the numbers we're running. My question is, you have voted for him today.  You said you support him...GIULIANI: I do.HANNITY: ... not endorse.GIULIANI: Well, people think that support is endorsement. My view of endorsement is being part of the campaign. But I fully support him, completely urge people to vote for him. I think he'd be the best candidate to beat Hillary Clinton. I'm just not part of the campaign, and I don't want people to think that I am.HANNITY: Stay right there, Mr. Mayor. We're going to just dip in and hear a little bit of Hillary Clinton talking in New York. She's at Clinton headquarters, as we continue our coverage from Trump Tower tonight. We're just going to -- let's hear a little bit from Hillary right now.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you, New York!AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!CLINTON: Thank you all so much. Thank you. You know, today -- today you proved once again there's no place like home!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, in this campaign we've won in every region of the country.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: From the north to the south to the east to the west, but this one's personal.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: New Yorkers, you've always, you've always had my back.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: And I've always tried to have yours.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: Today, together, we did it again, and I am deeply, deeply grateful. I want -- I want to thank everyone who came out and voted, and to all of you across New York who've known me and worked with me for so long.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: It is -- it's humbling that you trust me with the awesome responsibilities that await our next president.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: And -- and to all the people who supported Senator Sanders, I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: You know, we started this race not far from here on Roosevelt Island.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Pledging to build on the progressive tradition that's done so much for America from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And tonight, little less than a year later, the race for the democratic nomination is in the home stretch and victory is in sight.(APPLAUSE)(CROWD CHANTING)CLINTON: And I want to -- I want to say, I want to say to all of my supporters and all of the voters, you have carried us every step of the way with passion and determination that some critics tried to dismiss.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: Because of you, this campaign is the only one, democrat or republican to win more than 10 million votes.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: But I -- I'm going forward because more voices remain to be heard and tomorrow, it's on to Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and beyond.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: We need you to keep volunteering; I hope you will join the 1.1 million people who've already contributed at hillaryClinton.com.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And by the way, most with less than $100, because we have more work to do.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: Under the bright lights of New York, we have seen that it's not enough to diagnose problems, you have to explain how you'd actually solve the problems.(CROWD CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: That's what we have to do together. For our kids, for each other, for our country. So, I want you with me to imagine a tomorrow where no barriers hold you back. And all of our people can share in the promise of America.CLINTON: Imagine a tomorrow where every parent can find a good job and every grandparent can enjoy a secure retirement.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Where no child grows up in the shadow of discrimination or under the specter of deportation.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Where hard work is honored, families are supported, and communities are strong. A tomorrow where we trust and respect despite our differences.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Because we're going to make positive differences in people's lives, that is what this is supposed to be about, actually helping people and each other.[22:25:07] (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Now, we all know...(CROWD CHANTING)CLINTON: We all know too many people who are still hurting. I see it everywhere I go. The great recession wiped out jobs, homes, and savings. And a lot of Americans haven't yet recovered. But I still believe with all my heart, that as another great democratic president once said, ""there's nothing wrong with America that can't be cured what's right with America.""(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: That is after all what we've always done. It's who we are. America is a problem solving nation. And in this campaign we are setting bold, progressive goals backed up by real plans that will improve lives, creating more good jobs that provide dignity and pride in a middle class life.CLINTON: Raising wages and reducing inequality, making sure all our kids got a good education no matter what zip code they live in.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: Building ladders of opportunity and empowerment. So, all of our people can go as far as their hard work and talent will take them. Let's revitalize places that have been was left out and left behind from inner cities to cold countries to Indian country.CLINTON: And let's put Americans to work, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure including our failing water system like the one in Flint, Michigan.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: There are many places across our country where children and families are at risk from the water they drink and the air they breathe. Let's combat climate change and make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: Let's take on the challenge of systemic racism, invest in communities of color.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: And finally, pass comprehensive immigration reform.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: And once and for all, let's guarantee equal pay for women.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: And we are going to keep our families safe and our country strong and we're going to defend our rights. Civil rights, voting rights, women's rights, LGBT rights and rights for people with disabilities.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: Those are after all New York values and they are American values.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: And just as we did in this primary campaign we need to stand up for them, throw the general election and every day after that.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: You know, it's becoming clearer that this maybe one of the most consequential elections of our lifetimes.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Donald Trump and Ted Cruz...(CROWD BOOING)CLINTON:... are pushing a vision for America that's divisive and frankly dangerous, returning to trickledown economics opposing any increase in the minimum wage, restricting a woman's right to make her own health care decision.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: Promising to round millions of immigrants, threatening to ban all Muslims from entering the country.(CROWD BOOING)CLINTON: Planning to treat American Muslims like criminals.(CROWD BOOING)CLINTON: These things go against everything America stands for. And we have a very different vision. It's about lifting each other up, not tearing each other down.(CROWD CHEERING)CLINTON: So, instead of building walls, we're going to break down barriers. And in this campaign I've seen again our remarkable diversity and determination. This is a state and a country of big-hearted, open-minded, straight talking, hardworking people.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, like John, a firefighter from the south Bronx that I met shortly after 9/11 as he searched for survivors at ground zero, and like so many others, John got sick from breathing the toxic air. When we met again last week, he gave me a replica of his FDNY badge and thanked me for helping other first responders get the healthcare they need.We have to keep fighting for John and all of our firefighters and our police officers, our emergency responders and the construction workers who did so much for us.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Or Maxine, Maxine, a 27-year-old single mom from Staten Island who is here tonight.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: She shared with me how she worked her way out of poverty, graduated from college, thanks in part to the help she got from her child from the Children's Health Insurance Program that we started in the 1990s.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Or Mikey from -- is Mikey here? Well, I will tell you, Mikey spent six months in Riker's for low level drug offense. And he found out how hard it is for people who have done their time to find jobs when they get out. Mikey managed to start his own ice cream shop. I took a lot of you through the media there yesterday. I highly recommend it as you might have seen. I couldn't stop myself from eating it as soon as I got it.By the way, he made a concoction for me called ""Victory.""(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: But Mikey is one of the many reasons why we have to reform our criminal justice system and ban the box so others have a fair chance to succeed.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, New Yorkers and Americans speak every language, follow every faith, hail from every continent. Our diversity is one of our greatest strengths in the 21st century, not a weakness.As Robert Kennedy, whose Senate seat I was honored to hold, once said, we are a great country, an unselfish country, and a compassionate country.  And no matter what anyone tells you or what you might hear from others running for president, that is still true today.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: America is great and we can do great things if we do them together.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: So, please join us, text, join, 47426, go to HillaryClinton.com.  Be part of this campaign.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I know how important it is that we get the campaign's resources from people just like you who go in and chip in $5, $25. I am grateful to every one of you. And to the volunteers who have worked your hearts out.(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: By the way, Hillary Clinton wrapping up her victory speech from tonight. And, of course, she is finishing up and giving out her email address. We continue with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. You saw some attacks there. Republicans are dangerous and --(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Well, that's what she sudden.GIULIANI: We haven't revealed any top secret information as far as can I tell.  HANNITY: Well, that's a great point, right? Or committed any crimes.  GIULIANI: We haven't taken $1.2 million from UBS and made a phone call to try to get help for UBS by the secretary of state.HANNITY: We want to take away a woman's right to choose. The Republicans are dangerous. This is the old playbook they use every the election.GIULIANI: We weren't part of the bimbo squad. They want to talk about attacking women? You have got to be kidding me.HANNITY: She has the highest -- in terms of a candidate that I have ever watched in my life there's never been anyone viewed with numbers that 60- some odd percent of Americans unlikeable, untrustworthy, and dishonest.GIULIANI: It's confounding to me. And the reason I take the position that I take is because there are a lot of Republican that have to be brought along here. Donald Trump has demonstrated something tonight that no other candidate has demonstrated. He can win in the north and he can he win in the south. Whoever wins New York and Mississippi?HANNITY: Senator, good point.GIULIANI: How about Alabama and Massachusetts? Cruz is a sectional candidate at best. And he even lost in the section he could win in.I would like to see Senator Cruz, Governor Kasich, you know, these people who are saying I'm not going to come to the convention. I'm not going to vote for Trump. If Cruz was the candidate, I'm going to support him. I'm going to vote for him because I'm a Republican.I am trying as best I can by having some objectivity here and presenting myself to friends of mine who don't want to come along and support Trump, I want to see if I can bring them along, because I think when they really face the reality of it, we don't want her. We don't want somebody that dealt with national security with the kind of reckless disregard that she did. You know how many months did I give you my 13 possible crimes she committed?HANNITY: I thought it was 16.GIULIANI: Then I added three more and gave it to you. We don't want a president like that.  HANNITY: Here's the question. Right now the intensity, the anger between Cruz supporters against Trump supporters, Trump supporters against Cruz supporters, but if the polls hold up, Ted Cruz as of next Tuesday might be in the same position as John Kasich where it is mathematically impossible.GIULIANI: That's why we have got to calm this down. We need some objectivity. I have a lot of very good friends who you know that don't support Donald Trump. I want to bring them along. I think it's possible to bring them along, because I know when they calm down, and I have been in tough elections but I know what happens when you calm down, they are going to realize that Donald Trump is much better for this country than Hillary Clinton.  HANNITY: What do you make of what's happening on the delegate side of things? In other words --GIULIANI: This is going to turn some of those delegates. You know, some of those delegates that were moving toward Cruz, when they see a big win in New York like this, when they see the kind of cross sectional support that Trump has that Cruz does not have, when they see that tiny little number that Cruz got in New York, how could he ever win New York? How could he ever win Massachusetts? How could he ever win California?HANNITY: Do you think Trump can win those states? Those are deep blue states.GIULIANI: I think Trump is viable almost everywhere. Trump is Hillary's worse nightmare.HANNITY: Why do you say that?GIULIANI: I say that because she knows how to run against Senator Cruz.  Straight fast ball over the middle of the plate. They have been hitting that one out of the park for years. Donald Trump, as I described once before, is a Mariano Rivera, cut fast ball. You don't know where he is coming at you.HANNITY: That's true.GIULIANI: If I were her, and I mean this honestly, if I were her I would wanted to run against Senator Cruz. And this is no disrespect to Senator Cruz. I have great respect for him, but I would rather run against him than I would Donald. There's a playbook to run against Cruz. No playbook in running against Mr. Trump.HANNITY: Mr. Mayor, good to see you. Thank you so much for stopping by.GIULIANI: Thank you.HANNITY: Joining us now, Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham is standing by. Laura, good to see you. Your take on tonight and also the battle that is emerging in terms of if a candidate doesn't get to 1,237, they, you might say enticement that's might be going on, certainly the courting of delegates to switch for a second ballot vote, your thoughts?LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sean, I don't even think the question tonight after watching this massive victory by Trump in New York is whether he gets to 1,237. He may. He may not. But unless something really wacky happens over the next, you know, four to six weeks, he is going to go into that convention with the most delegates and the most votes.And tonight's exit polls showed that 70 percent of New Yorkers said that the person with the most delegates and the most votes should become the nominee. So the only question I think after tonight and after, as Rudy pointed out, the broad victories he has had in the northeast and he will have in the south and he'll have in places like New York and out in Arizona, the only question is how far will the Republican establishment go to kill off this guy who is the most popular of all the other candidates?This is analysis. This is not endorsement of Trump. This is an analysis.  How far will Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and all the other people who say they are not putting their finger on the scale, but come on. We heard Mitch McConnell today. We heard Paul Ryan talk about the negative tone.  Meanwhile, Sean, we're hearing about Trump staffers being blacklisted if they ever try to work again. Who has the bad tone now? Is it Trump or is it the GOP establishment that seems like it's pulling out every stop to try to stop him from getting this nomination? I think that's the real question.HANNITY: New York voters in exit polls said -- 70 percent of them said that the person who has the most votes, the most delegates, won the most states, they should get the nomination. But Mitch McConnell -- and it was 60 percent, interestingly, in Wisconsin where Donald Trump did not win in Wisconsin. But, still, the people there said the same.Mitch McConnell said when we get a nominee at 1,237 he will actually be the candidate. If not there will be a second ballot and I want delegates to pick somebody who can win.Now, when you add those comments to Mitt Romney's comments to Karl Rove's comments, prominent people within the GOP, doesn't it sound like they want the white knight candidate and they want to defy the will of the voters and disenfranchise them?  HANNITY: I think, Sean, this is where there is going to be a come to Jesus moment for Ted Cruz at some point, and it going to come soon. He better be really sure that all the delegate maneuvering that he has done, which has been good for him, it's been the smart thing to do. But he better make sure that all these people are wrapped up for him, because he might get to that convention and find a stiletto in his back, figuratively speaking.  And he will have no leverage at that point. And how much power will he have if Hillary ends up being president of the United States? How much power will any of these Republicans have, their agenda, their foreign policy, their -- maybe they will get their trade from Hillary and maybe they will get immigration amnesty, finally, from Hillary. But as far as the Supreme Court, everything that we know is so important, they will lose it all.So I know all the never-Trumpers feel like they are clean and they are pure and all of that, but if the majority of Americans and most delegates of the whole group goes to the guy who doesn't get the nomination, I don't see how this is going to end up well for the Republicans. I think it's a perilous course. And if this were anyone else but Trump right now, we would be seeing a coronation over at Capitol Hill at the RNC headquarters. But because it's him, no such happening.  HANNITY: So the establishment is mad at how the people have voted, people, by the way, that I think have legitimate anger and frustration with the Republican Party that has promised, for example, to do stop amnesty and repeal and replace Obamacare and use the power of purse, things that they never got done. Didn't they in a sense very much create an atmosphere where people want outsider, and now they're going to work behind the scenes perhaps deviously to try and take that vote away from the people or maybe even work against the candidate. Is that something we have to watch out for?HANNITY: I don't see a lot of signs that the establishment, even most of the big donors, are learning all that much from all of this. It would be nice if instead of the comment we heard from Mitch McConnell that he is basically looking forward to a second ballot, if someone like a McConnell, who is a smart guy who said, you know, we are watching that's going on and we are hearing the people's substantive concern. Not the personality contest, not the beauty contest, but the substantive concerns they have about the trade deal, about open borders, about more foreign workers coming in, about the refugees pouring into the country. We hear you and we're going to make some revisions. We are going to at least meet you halfway, people.But Sean, if the party no longer represents the people on these key issues, then there really is no party. At some point the party just becomes something else, I guess.  HANNITY: Well, if they try to white knight strategy, which Mitch McConnell was talking about and other prominent Republicans are, there will be no party. It's predicated on anger, resentment, hostility, and disenfranchisement. Laura, good to see you. Thank you.And joining us now on set with reaction, Donald Trump's convention manager Paul Manafort. Paul, good to see you. How are you?PAUL MANAFORT, DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Good, Sean.HANNITY: What do you think the final delegate count is for Mr. Trump tonight and his victor?MANAFORT: Well, I'm not sure yet. They're still counting a couple of close congressional districts, but we will top out over 90 delegates tonight.HANNITY: So it's almost a clean sweep.MANAFORT: At least 90 out of 95 and maybe a few more.HANNITY: Big night.All right, let's talk about, there was an article in Real Clear Politics today. We have been following, for example, states we thought were long done finished and over, following states like South Carolina, Georgia, other places. And there seems to be the courting of the delegates to, on a second ballot, to switch to another candidate. How big an issue is that in your mind?MANAFORT: There is not going to be a second ballot. So it's not an issue.HANNITY: You are convinced?MANAFORT: We have several ways to get to 1,237 by early June. And today was a giant step forward. We think we are going to have another great week next week. But more importantly, you saw record turnout today in New York.  And a record turnout with a primary that everybody knew Donald Trump was going to win.HANNITY: Does it bother you when Real Clear Politics has an article out today that, quote, ""Cruz can come in dead last in Pennsylvania,"" which is a week from now, ""and still take more than half the delegates""?MANAFORT: Cruz may take dead last in the vote, but is he not going to take half the delegates.HANNITY: So you have no concern about that or any of the other states? Or can you bring us inside how you get to 1,237? I tried to get that out of you last week.MANAFORT: I could, and you are not going to get it out of me this time either. But I can tell you we have got several ways to get there. Today, the 90-plus that we got today exceeded my base count in this state.HANNITY: What about the Cruz campaign and Reince Priebus saying everybody knew the rules coming in and in states like Colorado, Wyoming and other places, the campaign should have competed harder, what's your answer to that?MANAFORT: Donald Trump is not saying he didn't know the rules. He is saying the rules are not fair. And the people, the voters, the Republicans and the independents who have participated, they don't understand the rules. So when they think they are voting for Donald Trump and they are not getting the delegate support that because of the rules of the various states, Donald Trump is saying that's a rigged system.And he is not saying -- this is where there is confusion. He knows he can't change the rules this time. What he is saying though is it's a rigged political system and he is going to change it when he is president and leader of the party.  HANNITY: I think rules need to be changed. I think it's either a caucus or a primary. It's proportional and winner-take-all and bound delegates.But Paul, good to see you. Thanks for stopping by.MANAFORT: Thank you, Sean.HANNITY: All right, coming up, we have more Hannity right after this break as we continue straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity"" as we continue. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton the big winners in New York tonight. Joining us now, Peter Johnson Jr., Geraldo Rivera, Doug Schoen. What does this mean on the Republican side, Peter? It's momentum. There was two weeks, an interval.  Ted Cruz had a win in Wisconsin and now a big win for Donald Trump here.PETER JOHNSON JR, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Donald Trump made a great point tonight for his campaign that they can't beat him mathematically, that he is on the road to victory.The second point, and we heard it from his children, was that Cruz and Kasich are the interrupters. Donald Trump is not the interrupter. They are the spoilers. They are the people who want to get in the way of fair play and the democratic process in this country. And that they don't have a mathematical chance of winning, why are they in the race?HANNITY: Ted Cruz will still have one likely after tonight.JOHNSON: Barely, barely.HANNITY: After next Tuesday he will not.JOHNSON: Barely.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: It's bye-bye Bernie. It's Cruz is old news. America has the matchup they have wanted for six months.  It's Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump. Everything you hear from now until November, I submit, is just noise. This is a fair fight.  Ideological differences that are clear, right, left, red, blue.HANNITY: You don't think the Republicans in Cleveland are trying to take this from Trump?RIVERA: They will be absolutely irrelevant. I'm telling you, Sean, what happened tonight is, Doug is shaking his head.HANNITY: He is the presumptive nominee.RIVERA: It is something that will be replicated in New Jersey and in Pennsylvania and in Maryland and in Rhode Island and in Connecticut. Trump is, I think tonight, the presumptive nominee.DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sean, notwithstanding what Geraldo and Peter say, the Republican establishment is not going to accept these results even though the mandate from the people is clear.Big night for Hillary Clinton. The nomination, as Geraldo suggests, is effectively resolved. Bernie will fold eventually because he cannot win.  Hillary is the frontrunner, and as long as the Republicans are divided, it only helps the Democrats and Hillary.HANNITY: All right.JOHNSON: I believe in Frank Capra, meet John doll. ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" I believe fair play will out.HANNITY: But it's amazing how much we have learned how deeply there is this divide and how the establishment hates how voters have voted this election, be it for Cruz or Trump, two insurgents. They don't like either one of them.SCHOEN: Something else has happened Ted Cruz coming from a state as proud as Texas should have known. When you come to New York after you have insulted New York and then expect New Yorkers to have that kind of short- term memory to forgive you I think was preposterous. He got burned and he deserved it.HANNITY: Exit polls show that was a big issue.All right, we'll take a break. We have ""Hannity"" coming up on election night coverage straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right, that wraps things up for tonight. Big wins for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. And, of course, that's all the time we have left this evening. As always, thank you for being with us. Of course, we will be back in studio tomorrow night. But, let not your heart be troubled.
