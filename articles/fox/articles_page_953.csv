Tahmooressi's back	" This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" November 7, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SGT. ANDREW TAHMOORESSI, U.S. MARINE RELEASED FROM MEXICAN PRISON: They just locked me up in this cage. Guards outside were having fun with the whole thing. They were mocking me outside. Making fun of me. I felt like a target. I was like some kind of an animal in a cage here with no. I was thinking, well, maybe take my life.(END VIDEO CLIP)GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: U.S. Marine Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi telling his story on here ON THE RECORD. Just days after his release from a Mexican prison, the Marine describing the unthinkable conditions he faced behind bars, and all because he made a wrong turn.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TAHMOORESSI: I laid on the ground. I laid on the ground and then a guard comes over, running, and, you know, starts whacking me with a stick. He starts slapping my legs with a stick. Another guard puts his boot on my head in the ground. And then they drag me into the wall and put me on my knees up against the wall. And then they just started hitting me. They started hitting me, hitting me in the face with open palms.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: And our next guest played a giant part, yes, giant part in helping bring Sergeant Tahmooressi home.Montel Williams joins us. Nice to see you, Montel.MONTEL WILLIAMS, FORMER TALK SHOW HOST & FORMER U.S. MARINE: Good to see you, Greta.VAN SUSTEREN: Montel, Sergeant Tahmooressi is so fortunate to have you as a friend. Every marine is so fortunate to have you as a fellow marine. I want you as my friend. I mean, you really have this guy's back from the get-goWILLIAMS: And I want to make sure people understand. This is not something that we did because of the press. I had his back and I want to stay behind him, do this journey. We're working right now to see if we get him in the treatment program. I just spoke to him yesterday. He just texted me last night, I texted him back just now coming over here to get ready for this interview, and he just texted back again. So we are in communication. We are going to stay in communication because as you saw in that interview, which I got to tell you, Greta, Greta, you know, thank you for the way you treated him and you know, you're an interviewer. You're a news anchor, and this is what you're supposed to do. Thank you. The respect you showed him.VAN SUSTEREN: You know what?WILLIAMS: We understand.(CROSSTALK)VAN SUSTEREN: You know, I appreciate every single member of our military. I appreciate him. I appreciate you. But you know what who else we probably ought to give a little bit of a shout out for? It is someone who works for you. Jonathan Franks who has been -- he also helped you help him.WILLIAMS: Jonathan Franks who runs a company called Lucid is the head of my communication for Montel Media and Jonathan has been the stall wart in this. I will tell you something, you can ask Governor Richardson, you can ask Congressman Sam, and Congressman Royce, ask Jill. This young man who just came back from their home last, and he and I are working, you know, as closely as we can to make sure that again once this summer is down, let's make sure that Andrew gets the help he needs.And as you saw, you know, there were some moments in interview, people I think were probably reflecting on it right now. They are picking pieces to say, ""Oh, we have got to be angry about this and that."" But when you look at that young man, first off, the fact that he can even get this out, I applaud him, I applaud you. The fact that he was willing to share this now, I hope that everyone else who wants a piece him stops for now, and just look.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Stop the interview and knows that he needs a little bit of a break.VAN SUSTEREN: You know, PTSD is so serious and so overlooked, I think the thing that struck me about the interview is that he was released not because they said he had guns in his car in Mexico, he did, but because they said he had PTSD. But what really bothers me, I know he is not angry about it, but I am. It took 214 days for the Mexican government to realize he had PTSD. It took the U.S. government, they never came to that conclusion or helped, although they were well aware of the fact that he had an intake at San Diego showing he had PTSD. And if any viewers watches 15 seconds of this young man, they would realize he has a problem. So we get it in 15 seconds, Mexican government gets it 214 days, and our U.S. government, I don't know where they were.WILLIAMS: I don't know where they still are, but right now, I know there is a lot of people are stepping up to the plate. Andrew knows he has got a job with me, if he wants. This is not what's needed right now. What's needed -- you know, battled is willing to pay for. He needs treatment and you can see it. You stated it. Look at that interview up online right now, I watched and studied some this morning and looking at a couple spots. Because I'm talking to him and I want to try to help him get through this. And there were a couple of places where I could see he gets buried inside of himself, reliving that memory while he is trying to explain it to us. And, you know, anybody who is a psychiatrist or psychologist would say look, guys, watch this. We see it, and now, let's give him a chance to cure himself and heal please.VAN SUSTEREN: Anyone looking at this or listening to him, but you know, one of the things I asked him about was whether politics played a role in this and here is what he said about that(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDREW TAHMORESSI: I think they knew, you know, it wasn't you know, a long time before I got arrested. I mean, before -- long time before I got released. I think they knew, you know, they felt (inaudible). And I think they felt in their hearts that I wasn't guilty. But they decided to keep me there.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: What makes me even madder, Montel, is you know whatever political grudges there are in these nation or between nations or whatever, if politics played a part about it to make this marine sit there for 214 days, shame on everybody.WILLIAMS: I will tell you something. It was a shame on our political system for waiting for this law, too. Because remember, Greta, it took us the last two weeks to start getting senators and congressmen to sign onto the house resolution bill. We're blessed that we had, you know, Governor Richardson and Congressman Sam and Congressman Royce who decided to hold that hearing. You know that that hearing had much to do with the pressure amping up to get this young man out as anything else. So with your work and Glenn did, you know, it took, you know, what is that old saying? It takes a village to raise a child. It took this whole community coming together, gargantuan effort to get this young man out. Now that same effort is needed to get him the help he needs now.(CROSSTALK)VAN SUSTEREN: Just one last question. It is so distressing that there are so many other Americans in other prisons around world, and too bad they all don't have these tireless mothers like Jill Tahmooressi. It oftentimes does take a mother pounding on it and getting on the TV everyday, so I tip my hat to her as well.WILLIAMS: Same thing. I do. That woman should get award for, you know, showing us all how to take care of our children. And I respect her quite a bit. I tell you, Greta, again, don't let this die, make sure we keep this in the mindset of Americans to make sure they understand that look in that young man's eyes is a look in thousands of young men's eyes that are back from that war and they haven't gotten treatment that they need. And let's remember, congress passed the bill before they went away. We are still in the same place that we were before the bill was passed. Let's not forget please.VAN SUSTEREN: Montel, thank you very much. Always nice to talk to you.WILLIAMS: Thank you. Good to talk you, Greta. Thank you."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST:  And this is a Fox News Alert.  Welcome to ""Hannity.""Tonight, and we are live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a city that is on edge after two nights of violent protests.  Now, agitators burned buildings, damaged police cars, resulting in injured officers and over a dozen arrests.  Now, this all comes after a 23-year-old African-American man was shot and killed by an African-American cop over the weekend.Now, listen to what the sister of this man said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (INAUDIBLE)  Burn it down (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (INAUDIBLE) (INAUDIBLE) (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  And that's not all.  Protesters can also be heard on tape saying that white people are being attacked and to kick their white ass.  Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) white person come (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He white!  Beat him!  (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (EXPLETIVE DELETED).UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, look!  White boy!UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) they beating up every white person!  They beating up every white person!  (INAUDIBLE)  Who they beating up?  Who they chasing?(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  My friend, Sheriff David Clarke, will join us right here in Milwaukee in just a few minutes.But first, earlier today in Ohio, the 2016 GOP nominee unveiled his strategy to defeat ISIS and radical Islam, and he actually said the words.  Here are some of the highlights.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  A new immigration policy is needed immediately.  We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people.  In the cold war, we had an ideological screening test.  The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today.  I call it extreme vetting.One of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical Islam, which will include reformist voices in the Muslim community who will, hopefully, work with us.We want to build bridges and erase divisions.  The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization and to expose the networks in our society that support radical Islam.We will also keep open Guantanamo Bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  And a quick programming note.  Tomorrow night, Donald Trump will join us right here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for a town hall on that very topic.But first, joining now with reaction is former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich.  Mr. Speaker, before we get to Donald Trump's speech, which I think really puts out there profound differences between how he would deal with ISIS and radical Islam versus Hillary and Obama, I've got to ask you about this situation in Milwaukee.We just played the tape.  You have people saying, Burn down the white suburbs, and somebody else asking, Are they white, yes they're white, yes, they're white, OK, get their ass.  Hey, they're beating every white person.  He's white.  Beat his head.  B-word.  And it goes on and on, and you've seen the violence and you've seen the video.What is your reaction to this?NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, first, this is the tragic culmination of eight years of total failure by President Barack Obama who has routinely attacked the police, rendered judgment when he didn't know anything about what was going on and has increased the sense of racial hostility.Gallup reports that we now have the greatest tension that we've had in 16 years between the races.  This is a tragedy to have an African-American president fail just totally.Second, remember that there were nine people shot and five killed in Milwaukee in the 48 hours before this happened, but because they were just shot and killed without a policeman involved, for some reason, Black Lives Matter didn't think black lives mattered as long as no policeman was involved.Now, remember, you have an African-American policeman dealing with somebody who'd already been arrested 13 different times.  The gun that the person was carrying turned out to have been stolen in a burglary, and the video shows clearly that that man was aiming the gun at the policeman.  Now, in a period when folks have declared war on cops, I don't think you can expect cops to wait to get shot.So my specific advice is let's start setting up cameras so that every time you have a riot like this, we film every person involved, and in the next three or four days, we go out and pick them up.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  We had video of Ferguson.  We had video of Baltimore.GINGRICH:  Right.HANNITY:  We've had those people on video.  They never followed up.  They never arrested those people.GINGRICH:  Right.  That's because if you're a liberal...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... a ""get out of jail free"" card, you're free to go and continue that behavior.GINGRICH:  Right  That's because of the lesson of liberalism is don't lock anybody else up, even if you have 3,500 dead in Chicago, 99 people shot in Chicago last week, 24 died.  But under liberalism, you yell about guns and do nothing about criminals, and everything gets worse.We've had a 20 percent increase in violent crime in the major cities in the last year because the Obama policies are all coming home to roost and they're anti-police and pro-criminal.  And it's going to get worse before it gets better.HANNITY:  I have actually taken time on this television show, Mr. Speaker, and we have scrolled the names of those 3,500 people.  Most of America have never heard their names before, but if it's a high-profile racial case, if it's Cambridge, the president rushes to judgment, no due process, no presumption of innocence.  The same thing in Ferguson, the same thing in Baltimore, the same thing with George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin.I would think in his own home city, he'd care that 3,500 of his fellow Chicago citizens are dead since the time he's been president, but apparently not.GINGRICH:  And remember, it's Hillary Clinton's birthplace.  So you have the current president and their candidate for president both from Chicago, and they seem to be totally coldly indifferent to the deaths of their fellow Americans.  I mean, it's truly a tragic thing.And by the way, Sheriff Clarke has been magnificent in the last two or three days.  I'm so glad you're having him on tonight because he is such -- in my mind, he's a genuine American hero who's had the courage to tell the truth and to do his job...HANNITY:  And he's a great leader.GINGRICH:  ... and stand up to special interests.HANNITY:  Yes.  All right, I want to -- let me go to Donald Trump's speech for a minute.  I actually think that today's speech was probably the best speech he's given since he has been a candidate, and I want to tell you why.  He identified -- first of all, he wasn't talking about The New York Times, wasn't talking about the mayor of Baltimore or any other people.   His focus was on two people, which I think should be the focus of this campaign, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.He laid out a list of one terror example after another, one bad policy failure after another, one broken part of the world after another because of what they have done.  And then he laid out a solution-based program on how he would do things differently, from immigration, to vetting refugees, to security, to identifying radical Islam, and on and on.To me, that seems to be the paradigm that he ought to take for the rest of the campaign on every issue.  Forget everybody else, identify the problem and the mistakes and offer solutions.GINGRICH:  Well, I agree with you about that for the campaign.  But I don't want to just jump past his speech.  For the first time in the 37 years since the Iranians illegally seized American hostages, in the 15 years since al Qaeda killed Americans on 9/11, for the very first time, you've got a president of the United States get up and tell the truth, that there is a system of radical Islamists...HANNITY:  A candidate, yes.GINGRICH:  You know, and he did just a remarkable job, in my judgment, of identifying the enemy, describing accurately how big the problem is.  And this is in some ways is the most important foreign policy speech since Ronald Reagan, in that it really does set the stage for a debate for the American people about what's threatening us, what we should do about it.And I think the contrast between what he did -- what Donald Trump did and what Hillary Clinton is couldn't be clearer.  This is a Grand Canyon-wide chasm of two totally different world views.HANNITY:  Yes.  You think about it, I mean, this is the JV team, as Barack Obama said.  Hillary Clinton started the negotiations with the Iranians and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  They got $150 billion.  Then they got $400 million for hostages as a ransom payment.  We don't have a strategy yet, the president once said.  He said they're contained.  He said ISIS does not pose an existential threat to us, which is wrong, too.  We don't have that strategy quite yet, and he goes on and on.He's been wrong every step of the way, Mr. Speaker, on every...GINGRICH:  You're right, he's been wrong and Hillary's been wrong.  But I want to go back to Donald Trump just for a second.  All of his critics have said, Give us a clear road map of where you would go.  Now he took what may be the most important national security threat of the next decade.  He outlined what the threat is.  He outlined why we have failed.  He outlined how important it is, and he began to lay the base for a very serious, very dramatic change.This was truly a historic speech.  I'm interested to see if the mainstream media can actually focus on the speech and can actually talk about the difference between the confusion of the Obama/Clinton model and the clarity of the Trump model.HANNITY:  Well, I wouldn't hold your breath for that because the biggest contributors to Hillary Clinton's campaign clearly are the media, and I would even argue that some of the Republicans that lost that are crybabies that have picked up their toys that would prefer Hillary pick the Supreme Court justices.But I want to ask you one -- one question, a strategic question in terms of the campaign.  If Donald Trump approached every issue that we are facing today in terms of the economy -- he gave a speech on the economy recently - - if he approached immigration this way, if he approached ""Obama care"" this way, if he approached the need for energy independence, if he approached all of these big important issues that we're now facing, Supreme Court justices, and he would follow the same model of today, lay out the problem, the mistakes that have been made, offer a new direction and keep his focus, wouldn't that be a winning formula?GINGRICH:  Well, I saw one study that said if he did that, a political scientist who said the odds are that he would win by 65 or 66 percent because of the underlying patterns that we're faced with, which would really be -- would just shock the whole system.But let's take where you are tonight.  I'm really delighted that you're in Milwaukee because it's very important.  I hope -- and I know he's going to be with you tomorrow night.  I hope he's going to talk a little bit tomorrow night about the inner city, but I hope in the next few days, you're going to see him be honest as Sheriff Clarke is.Failure in schools with the teacher union as a major enemy of children, failure in city bureaucracies which kill jobs with regulation, failure among local politicians who pander to the criminals and fail to stand up for the law enforcement agencies, failures to create job-friendly environment, failures to find new strategies in welfare to encourage families to stay together, rather than be broken up.  Sheriff Clarke understands all this even better than I do.I hope that Trump is going to have the courage, and (INAUDIBLE) Mike Pence with him, to get right in the middle of the left's zone, take them head on, understand the left-wing politicians will all go crazy, but...HANNITY:  We'll do that tomorrow.GINGRICH:  ... they're the people who've failed.  They're absolutely the people who have failed.HANNITY:  And you know, I'll give these statistics with Sheriff Clarke in a minute, but they have failed.  And most of the cities that are struggling so badly right now have been run by Democrats for decades.  And under Obama, there's a 58 percent increase in African-Americans that are now on food stamps, 20 percent increase in black Americans that are not participating in the labor force.  I'll get into that with Sheriff Clarke.Mr. Speaker, thank you for being with us.GINGRICH:  Thank you.HANNITY:  Now we have a quick programming note.  We are in the Badger State.  We're ahead of our town hall with Donald Trump. I'll be right here tomorrow night.  If you live in and around Milwaukee area, you want to be a part of the show tomorrow night -- by the way, Governor Scott Walker will be here.  Sheriff Clarke will be here.  Just go to Hannity.com, my Web site, find out all the details.  You don't want to miss it.And coming up -- on Saturday, right here in this city, violent protests erupted after an African-American police officer killed a 23-year-old African-American man who reportedly had a gun in his hand.  Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke joins us live to talk about the state of his city.That and more as we continue from Milwaukee.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to ""Hannity.""  Now, the city of Milwaukee is on edge following two nights of destructive protests, where agitators burned buildings, damaged police cars, pelted police with rocks and bottles and other things, resulting in injured officers and over a dozen arrests.Now, this comes after a 23-year-old man was shot and killed by a police officer, and that, of course, he was carrying a gun and has a long rap sheet.  Now, the city's police chief said the suspect was shot after turning towards the officer with a gun in his hand while attempting to flee from a traffic stop.Here with reaction is Milwaukee County sheriff, our friend, David Clarke.  Sheriff, how are you?  I'm sorry about this -- I've witnessed this in any city.  I'm sorry to see that anywhere.DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF:  Thanks.  This is my hometown, so it hurts a little more, but welcome to Milwaukee.HANNITY:  Yes, it's great to be back.  All right, let me play some of the tape.  I mean, we've gone through this in great detail, some of the things that are said.  Let's roll tape.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (INAUDIBLE) (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (INAUDIBLE)  (INAUDIBLE) white person (INAUDIBLE)  He white!  Beat him (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (EXPLETIVE DELETED)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hey, look.  White boy.  They beating up every white person!  They beating up every white person!  (INAUDIBLE) Who they beating up?  Who they beating up?  Who they chasing?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When the people start setting (EXPLETIVE DELETED) on fire, that's because they feel like they can't do anything else.  That's what that means.  It comes from helplessness, and they put us in office to help.  We haven't been doing enough.  Everybody is playing (EXPLETIVE DELETED) politics, and nobody is playing life.  Our people are living and dying on the streets.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Sheriff, let me turn to you.  Four of your officers got hurt last night.CLARKE:  Rocks were flying not too long after the crowd started to move.  I authorized tonight a higher use of force.  We're going to do this reasonably and by the Constitution, but I've authorized the use of some non-lethal stuff to disperse the crowd if it happens again.HANNITY:  Let's talk a little bit about what you just heard there about getting the white person and (INAUDIBLE) he's white.  Let's get him.  Let's beat his ass, and all this -- all this nonsense.CLARKE:  Look, Saturday night, the social order collapsed in Milwaukee.  That leads to tribal behavior.  That leads to the law of the jungle replacing the rule of law.  And that kind of behavior (INAUDIBLE) we just heard is part of that.  It's shameful, I think, at the time.It's culturally dysfunctional black underclass behavior.  We've had the growth of the underclass here in Milwaukee.  Milwaukee could be a case study.  This didn't happen overnight.  Several decades, three, four, five decades of progressive liberal Democrat political rule here that has created the expansion of the welfare class, the expansion of a state of dependency.We lead in these economic indicators.  We lead in poverty rates, sixth poorest city in America, school failure, Milwaukee public schools K-12, one of the worst performing in terms of math, reading scores, graduation rates attendance rates.Black male unemployment in the city of Milwaukee, 32 percent.  Seventy percent of kids born out to wedlock.  You have questionable lifestyle choices, and those are self-inflicted pathologies.Those are encouraged by the welfare state.  This thing was created.  Sean, I grew up in this city, it was never like this.  This was always a working class, blue collar, middle class.  The middle class has fled, and now what you have is the government dependency.HANNITY:  Let's talk about the correlation here because I think this is really important, and -- you know, I give out economic statistics every day because under this president, not only did we double the debt, but we have 12 more million Americans on food stamps since Obama's been president, 8 million more in poverty, the lowest labor participation rate since the '70s, the worst recovery since the '40s.We have the lowest home ownership rate in 51 years.  We have one in five in American families, not a single member of that family is working.  One in six American males 18 to 34, prime working age, are either are incarcerated or they are out of work, living in Mommy and Daddy's basement.  And we have the -- we pay more money per capita per student, and 35th in terms of education in the industrialized world.CLARKE:  Well, you know as well as I do that these progressive Democrat urban policies create an underclass, all right?  They create by design -- this is by design for ultimately political power.  Just always...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  In other words, it's creating dependency and failures so they need to elect -- they get the power by creating dependency so people keep them in power?CLARKE:  It helps them maintain power.  This is cruel.  Look, the black community has been exploited ever since Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, OK?  They marginalized the black man, removed him totally, was expendable, said Uncle Sam's going to be the dad.  Uncle Same is going to raise the kids.  Uncle Sam is a horrible father, and we're seeing the results of that.We know the young men in the black community growing up without a father to shape their behavior, more times than not -- not always, more times than not grows up to be an unmanageable misfit that the police have to deal with in aggressive fashion like we saw Saturday night.So you know, the alderman in the quote that we were listening to, he talks about oppression and -- you know what the only remnant of oppression for black people is left in America?  The Democrat Party!HANNITY:  Let me ask you this because in this particular case, it just happened to be a black officer, and you have a guy with a rap sheet a mile long from heroin, cocaine, weapons, all these charges in his past -- - he has a gun, 23 bullets apparently in the clip.  I don't know how you get 23.CLARKE:  Extended clip.HANNITY:  Extended clip, OK.  So you got 23 bullets.  I'm told -- you know, the story they first came out -- Oh, they shot him in the back, just like Michael Brown.  Turns out they didn't shoot him in the back.  The officer shot him in the front, which means that gun was probably pointed at the officer.CLARKE:  Well, not only that, but the gun was stolen.  And the investigation, you know, in time will tell what happened.  But here's the thing.  It doesn't matter that the officer was black.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Would it have made a difference in the mind of the president who rushed to judgment in Florida and Baltimore and Ferguson and Cambridge?CLARKE:  He's probably stumped on this one.  Somehow, they try to turn this into an issue about guns, the NRA and gun control.  None of that is here, so he keeps his mouth shut.But look, there's a way out of this, but we're going to have to continue to push back -- and what I've been doing, with your platform -- and I appreciate that -- to push back against these destructive progressive policies that have hit the black community like a nuclear blast.HANNITY:  All right, last question.  Now that there's a 58 percent increase since Obama's been president of black Americans on food stamps, a 20 percent increase in black Americans not participating in the labor force -- so Obama's liberalism has failed.  America's black -- first black president has not helped black America.  But yet 90 percent, if you read the polls, of black Americans keep voting Democratic.  Why?CLARKE:  Well, it's that exploitation, OK?  They use the -- you know, they set this thing up, and then they use this boogeyman, this boogeyman of racism.  You know how this works.  At election time, they come -- it happens in Milwaukee...HANNITY:  Race card is played every election.CLARKE:  If you vote Republican, they're going to take your food assistance or your rent assistance away, your heat assistance away.HANNITY:  Telegramming (ph).CLARKE:  The people who have -- and the people who can't drill down into some of this stuff to figure out for themselves that are susceptible to the propaganda, that's a scary thought.  I kind of get that, but that's why we need a plurality of voices in this community.I provide it with the help of talk radio here.  And we just need a plurality of voices.  And you have to keep -- you know how this works.  You have to...HANNITY:  Keep that happening.CLARKE:  ... control the -- keep beating the narrative over and over and over again.  Over time, this community, the black community, my community, they're going to open their eyes.  And when they do, I tell you what.   They're not going to like what they see.HANNITY:  Sheriff, your city's in our prayers.  Really mean that.  You're going to be here tomorrow night with Mr. Trump and at our town hall.   Governor Walker will be here.  We'll see you back here tomorrow.CLARKE:  I'll be here.HANNITY:  All right, thank you, Sheriff.  Appreciate it.And coming up, we have more reaction to the violent protests erupting right here in the city of Milwaukee.  Our panel weighs in.And also later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  A big speech by Donald Trump today laying out his plan to destroy ISIS, defeat radical Islam.  Lieutenant Oliver North will weigh in.That's coming up later as we continue tonight from Milwaukee.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to ""Hannity.""  Now, authorities here in Milwaukee -- they're trying to calm tensions in the city after two nights of riots.  Here with reaction, Salem Radio nationally syndicated talk show host Larry Elder, also radio talk show host James Harris and civil rights attorney, who worked in Ferguson and in the Trayvon Martin case, Daryl Parks is with us.Larry, let me start with you and get your reaction.  You heard what I heard.  You witnessed what I witnessed.  You see what's going on.  Your reaction.LARRY ELDER, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  My reaction is I hope somehow, we can figure out a way of cloning Sheriff David Clarke.  I once interviewed Kweisi Mfume, when he was the head of the NAACP, and I said, Mr. Mfume, as between the presence of white racism or the absence of black fathers, which poses bigger threat to the black community?  Without missing a beat, he said the absence of fathers.When I was in college, I read a book called ""The Negro Family: A Case for National Action"" written by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who later on became a Democratic senator for New York.  At the time, 25 percent of black kids were born outside of wedlock.  Fifty years later, trillions of dollars spent on the so-called War on Poverty, that percentage is now 73 percent.And it was Obama who said a kid raised without a dad is five times more likely to be poor, 20 times more likely to end up in jail.  We need to rethink the welfare state because as Sheriff Clarke pointed out, what the welfare state has done is to incentivize women into marrying the government and allowed me to abandon their financial and moral responsibility.HANNITY:  That's profound and that's really deep, and at a certain level, everything you're saying is true.  Daryl, I've known you for a long time.   We're very friendly.  You've been on a wrong side of a lot of these issues, as far as I'm concerned, especially in Ferguson, especially with Trayvon Martin.  And so I ask you, Daryl, when you see this talking about killing white people, I know you.  You don't agree with this.DARYL PARKS, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY:  Without question.  Sean, let me say we have to be careful.  The person that you saw on the news earlier today -- that person does not speak for the community.  What we see in Milwaukee and what I've seen over the last two days is a community that's crying out, We need help in many ways.  So I'm hoping...HANNITY:  No, they're not...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Stop!  They're not -- stop, Daryl!  That's not true!  They're crying out, Kill the white person.  Oh, he's white...PARKS:  No, they're not, Sean.  That's not true.HANNITY:  That's what they're crying out.  They're not crying out for help.   I have the tape, Daryl!  We just played it!PARKS:  That was one person!  Sean, there are many other people...HANNITY:  There are numerous people involved in doing this.  There are numerous people involved in actually engaging in this behavior.  PARKS:  I think it's a leadership void.  Obviously there's leadership that's failing.  Maybe people like that sheriff need to go and figure out what's the problem.  HANNITY:  You're right.  They're going to say that Barack Obama, black Americans under Barack Obama, food stamp participation has gone up 58 percent, black Americans out of the labor force up 20 percent under Barack Obama.  Inner city schools --PARKS:  Don't make it a political issue.  It's a social issue.  It's a social issue that needs to be addressed.  HANNITY:  What's your take on this, James?  JAMES HARRIS, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Yes, sir.  HANNITY:  What's your take on all this?  HARRIS:  You know what, I am from the Sherman Park area.  I moved into the Sherman Park area because of the strong families that were there.  I raised two boys and my daughter in that area.  I'm listening to all the statistics and I'm listening to all of the excuses, but the reality is that there are very strong families in that area, and they are adversely affected by the politics of the situation.  HANNITY:  That's a good point.  The overwhelming 99 percent of people that live there are, I'm sure, appalled by this and did not participate, but it is happening in their neighborhood, and I'm sure they don't want it there.  HARRIS:  Listen, we used to live there.  It's a beautiful area.  It's the most multicultural area of Milwaukee.  I raised my kids there.  We called it the urban Mayberry.  However you shouldn't walk your dog at night.   There's some things you could not do, and when violence like this erupts like it did five years ago when I was there --HANNITY:  -- that is not Mayberry.  (LAUGHTER)HARRIS:  Mayberry in that the neighbors knew for each other and cared for each other and they watched out for each other.  But you're right in that the dark underbelly of this is that you've had decades of dependency that has created a culture of violence that does not believe in rule of law and does not have the same values that the rest of the people share, and it erupts from time to time like it did last weekend.  HANNITY:  And Democratic policies have failed black Americans.  I know Larry is very passionate about this and has talked about it for years.   Larry, we'll get to you when we get back.  And also when we come back, we'll get our panel to react to this, by the way.  I'll debate a man who says that the rioting and the looting is a demand for justice.  And also tonight --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump laying out his plan to defeat ISIS and radical Islam.  He actually said the words ""radical Islam."" What a refreshing change.  Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North has reaction later on.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to ""Hannity.""  Milwaukee is now trying to get to the peace following two nights of violence unfortunately.  Now, some are saying what they are seeing in the city is the result of decades of racial tensions now boiling over.  Joining us now is the co-founder of the Coalition for Justice.  His name is Nate Hamilton.  Nate, thank you.  You heard the calls for beating up white people, and, ""Oh, they're white.  Let's get them and let's beat their ass.""  You heard all of that on the tapes.  I also understand you're a supporter of the Black Lives Matter group.  Is that true?  NATE HAMILTON, COALITION FOR JUSTICE CO-FOUNDER:  I don't know who the Black Lives Matter group is.  HANNITY:  You know who Black Lives Matter is.  Let's not be cute.  You know what Black Lives Matter is.  HAMILTON:  I know Black Lives Matter is a name.  It's a name that everyone uses now.  HANNITY:  Right.  It's a name and it's a group, and there are members of this group, and you have been supportive of them.  And as a matter of fact you're group the Coalition of Justice, you protested with Black Lives Matter.  We've got this one guy that keeps going to the White House and visiting the president.  HAMILTON:  -- the coalition of justice.  HANNITY:  What are your thoughts on last night?  What do you think when you hear people say, ""Oh, they're white.  Let's get them.  Let's beat their ass.""  Do you like that?  HAMILTON:  No, I think people have misplaced aggression.  There is a systematic oppression and the aggression is in the wrong place.  And they have to put that aggression somewhere else into getting things done.  HANNITY:  Where should they put their aggression?  HAMILTON:  More trainings.  They need to put it where the people who can change it.  Our elected officials need to do more.  Our governor needs to do more.  There's a substantial amount of people in the black community that are doing good.  HANNITY:  Let me ask you this.  We've had the first black president in the history of the United States and 58 percent increase of black Americans on food stamps.  We have 20 percent increase of black American out of the labor force since Obama has been president.  Has Barack Obama been good for black America?  Has his policies, his liberal, leftist, statist policies been good for black Americas?HAMILTON:  Is Barack Obama the only one that can bring jobs to this city?   No.  HANNITY:  No, but he's the president.  (CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  But answer the question.  Have things gotten better for black Americans under Barack Obama?  I'm asking because if you looked at it black --HAMILTON:  It's not just Barack Obama.  It's George Bush.  It's Bill Clinton.  It's Reagan.  Black people have been suffering for decades.  HANNITY:  Wake up.  HAMILTON:  People have been suffering for years.  It's just not Barack Obama.  We were suffering a long time before he came here, and he had to deal with the problems and getting things better.  It's not more government.  HANNITY:  Is the answer more government?  HAMILTON:  It's not more police officers.  It's more resources for a community that is suffering right now.  They're hanging a piece of bacon over the black community's head and they're saying who is going to be the first one to go get it?  How are you going to get it?  Yes, more funding will get it.  More businesses will get it.  HANNITY:  I think we need more opportunity.  HAMILTON:  More entrepreneurship will get it.  More financial literacy training will get it.  But we're not getting these things in our community right now, so that's what we're fighting for with the Coalition of Justice, for more community development, more programming, more things that will be substantial in building a community.  HANNITY:  Hang on.  I appreciate you being with us, and as Sheriff Clarke pointed out, you know what, look at the city, number sixth in poverty nationwide.  If you look at Baltimore, the poverty, look at Ferguson, all these cities we keep talking about sadly have been Democratically run for years.  I think the policies of leftism, statism, progressivism, socialism, redistribution, spreading the wealth has not helped anybody from the Great Society on.  I appreciate you staying on.  We continue now with Larry Elder.  Larry Elder is with us, James Harris, and Daryl Parks.  Larry, what's your reaction to this?  Is it more government?  More distribution of resources, is that the answer?  LARRY ELDER, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  No, of course not.  We're spending a great deal of money K through 12.  In fact America spends more money K thought 12 I think than any other industrialized country on the face of the earth.  It's not about that.  It's about, as I said before, it's about morals, it's about values, it's about men living up to their obligations.  Barack Obama wrote a book called ""Dreams from My Father"" about the angst that he experienced because I think he met his biological father one time.  He even lied to his children about what his father did because he felt so bad about that.  Jessie Jackson's mom was a teenage mom who got pregnant by the married man who lived next door, and when Jackson was growing up in South Carolina, the kids taunted him, ""Jessie ain't got no daddy, Jessie ain't got no daddy.""  Al Sharpton lived a nice, comfortable, middle class life until his father abandoned the family and then down to the ghetto.  And these are three of our most prominent so called black leaders, and they ought to be talking about the difficulty when you don't have a dad and that men should live up to their more responsibilities.  Finally, the one so called leader, Farrakhan, had a march called the Million Man March where he talks about what happens if you don't live up to your moral responsibilities when you bring children into the world.  So out of all these so-called leaders, the only one really telling the truth about all of this is Louis Farrakhan.  Too bad about the anti-Semitism and the other stuff in his message, but at least he's talking about live up to your moral responsibilities and abide with those values.  HANNITY:  And he talks about don't count on the government, be independent, don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs, take care of your family, be a father.  I think that's good for any race or any person.  Daryl Parks, what do you think the answer is?  PARKS:  Without question, Sean, I think the answer is, one, lack of economic opportunities in inner city Milwaukee, number two, the educational system in inner city Milwaukee.  It's obvious that this community needs help on the ground.  And I want to hear solutions from the local leaders as to what we do to change those views.  HANNITY:  Maybe they should take Donald Trump's advice and send education back to the states and local communities.  It sounds like you're supporting Trump's idea.  PARKS:  I wouldn't say I'm supporting Trump.  I'm supporting Hillary Clinton.  And so I think the solutions are on the ground in that community.  HANNITY:  Hillary is supporting the same failed policies of Obama.  James, we'll give you the last word.  HARRIS:  Sean, one of our guests is right.  This is not an issue about Black Lives Matter.  This has been going on in Milwaukee since the late 1960s.  And what you're hearing is people are putting their political agendas on top of the riot that took place in Milwaukee.  What you have, as Larry Elder was saying, you have a government that has subsidized a father not being in the home.  And what you're seeing is after decades of that you have children who are angry, who are misguided, adults who are angry and misguided.  There's been two full generations of this.  And what you're seeing those progressive policies coming home to roost.  The answer is not in government.  The answer is going to be in the very communities that are under this type of pressure, but they have to get it themselves.  Otherwise it just really won't count, will it?  HANNITY:  James and Larry, you guys are right.  Daryl, unfortunately you're usually wrong, but I still like you personally a lot.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  Thank you all for being with us.  Important issues here.  And coming up, we have reaction to Donald Trump's big speech from earlier today.  Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, he joins us as we continue from Milwaukee.  By the way, if you want to be part of our town hall tomorrow night right here in the Pabst Theater with Donald Trump, just go to my website, Hannity.com.  It's the only place you can get tickets and find out how you can join us.  That's tomorrow, Governor Walker, Donald Trump, and, yes, Sheriff David Clarke.  We'll continue.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Well said.  More from Donald Trump's foreign policy address earlier today.  Joining us now, the host of ""War Stories,"" Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North.  Colonel, he laid out the failures.  He laid out the danger, the assessment of the real nature of evil in our time, and he offered a different path.  Your reaction to this?  And will he ever get any media coverage for substance, because so far the media is obsessed with everything else?  LT. COL. OLIVER NORTH, HOST, ""WAR STORIES"":  Look, I love the title, ""How to Destroy the Barbarians."" It was spot-on.   I gave it an A.  And best of all, he identified the enemy clearly.  He put blame where it belongs for the genocide in the Middle East, the Libyan fiasco, the greatest refugee catastrophe since World War II, and now radical Islamists operational in 28 to 30 countries.  I also like his three-point plan for what he's going to do as president to end this madness.  Number one, stand with any nation that stands with us.  And he mentions by name, Israel, Jordan, Egypt.  He commended NATO for reorganizing to combat radical Islamic terror and he said he was going to try to find common ground with Russia in the fight against ISIS.  Second point, he wants joint and coalition military and intelligence operations to eliminate radical Islamic safe havens, cut off funding, including Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah.  That is a quote.  He wants cyber warfare and psychological operations to disable their recruiting and their propaganda.  He says you cannot allow the Internet to be used as a recruiting tool.  He's not going to announce what our military will or won't do beforehand.  That's got to drive them nuts at the White House because that's all they do.He's going to keep Gitmo open, and capture, not just kill, terror leaders.  He's going to collect intelligence to prosecute enemy combatants and try them in military tribunals.  And third, he's going to protect the homeland.  He's going to secure our borders, establish a new immigration screening process.  He's only going to admit into the United States those who share our values and will say the U.S. constitution is the law of the land, not sharia.  He called it extreme vetting.  He's going to suspend immigration from countries that support terrorism, stop issuing visas and put an adequate screening procedure in place.  In the cold war, Sean, we had a question that was asked.  Are you now or have you ever been a member of a communist party in whatever country your coming from?  If the answer is yes, they went back for more vetting.  They didn't just wander around America.  He wants a commission to development those new protocols for law enforcement, homeland security, and immigration officers.  His mission, as he said it, shut down Islamic terrorist support, and that works here and overseas.  He wants to promote the virtues of our exceptional way of life.  HANNITY:  Let me ask this.  NORTH:  This is magnificent.  What more can they want?  HANNITY:  I -- it's everything I believe we should be doing, and even more.   And take the oil, I agree with that, too.  But here is the question.  There are some Republicans that are openly sabotaging Donald Trump.  And I say if Hillary were to win, I'm blaming them.  And that means people at National Review and Weekly Standard and a lot of Congressman and senators and former presidential candidates.  And Trump on the justices need a point, immigration, ISIS, ObamaCare, what do you say to them in 30 seconds we have left?  NORTH:  You know what, if you're a critic of what this man just proposed, then you don't belong in the voting process.  Critics are already pointing to his quote, ""evolving positions.""  I heard that just an hour before coming on air with you.  Do you know what we used to call evolving positions?  We used to call that wisdom.  I was very impressed with that stand that he took today.  HANNITY:  And what do Marines do, don't they adapt?  NORTH:  And overcome.  Adapt and overcome.  You got it.  HANNITY:  All right, Colonel, safe home.  NORTH:  Semper fi, buddy.HANNITY:  Appreciate it.  Appreciate you.  And coming up, quick programming note, tune in this Sunday for ""War Stories"" starting at 8:00 p.m. on our sister network, the FOX Business Network.  When we come back, more ""Hannity"" right here from Milwaukee, straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  All right, that's wrapping things up for us tonight.  Now, tune in tomorrow night right here at the Pabst Theater.  We're in Milwaukee.  We'll be hosting a town hall with Donald Trump.  If you want to be part of the audience just go to Hannity.com, that's my last name dot-com, and I'll be up early, by the way, thank you morning with Steve and Brian and Ainsley.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Bill O'Reilly says throw them into prison for five years if they come back. Donald Trump says build a wall and make Mexico pay for it to keep them out. Senator Tom Cotton says if you choose to be a sanctuary city and hide illegals from the feds, you should be stripped of your federal law enforcement grants. All interesting ideas, I'd say all of the above, but if you disagree with me, maybe too insensitive to illegals. Let's see if you still think so after listening to these families who lost children to illegals committing crimes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAN GOLVACH, SON KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT: It's the strange thing is, Spencer's mother and I, we don't think about the killer that much. We feel like he was more or less a foot soldier and it's our government that did this. It's you know, cherry picking laws.MARY ANN MENDOZA, SON KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT: I'm looking at this thinking and listening to all these other stories thinking, the leniency that our government is showing these illegals is costing innocent American lives. If people don't start speaking the truth and acknowledging that we have a problem at the border, for the sake of getting votes, I am getting more and more disgusted with politicians in this country.SABINE DURDEN, SON KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT: People's feelings are hurt well. My heart is ripped apart and these other families here. Our lives will never be the same. He was my only child.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Now Greg, it really hits home when you hear those families.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well, the point that -- the important point here is what if a government refuses to enforce laws that conflict with their own political ideology? What if -- the left should consider, what would happen if conservative lawmakers did the same thing? What if -- could there be a sanctuary city for the Confederate flag? Where you're allowed to put it wherever you want? Should you have sanctuary cities that protect you from sanctuary proponents? That would be nice that. That would be refreshing. This is a consequence of a leftist ideology that puts tolerance before security. It's not just here with immigration. You see it with the war on terror. You see it with law enforcement. These areas, these three areas are being sacrificed at the altar of tolerance. But it's hard to be nice to other people when you're dead. It's more important to be secure. And then you can be nice.BOLLING: Dana, are you -- where are you on sanctuary cities? Should we have them?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: No. I don't think so. And I think that the permissiveness of allowing them over the last 6 1/2 years to grow into this monster, that it is now is actually -- it's catching up with the democrats in a way that it's catching them a little bit too late, too little too late because now, as you see a little bit later and they got the package from Jesse Watters in here. There is case law about, like the Lopez case, I'm sure Kimberly is familiar with this, about background checks and guns and it has to do with what law -- local law enforcement has to do with regards to what the federal law says. Actually, case law and which is why I think that Tom Cotton's proposal is probably the most feasible because the one thing that the federal government can do is withdraw the money and the federal grants. That actually seems like the most plausible thing to be able to do immediately that would at least send a signal to sanctuary cities.BOLLING: Yeah. Juan, what about that? So the feds send sanctuary cities money for law enforcement, but they're.PERINO: Right.BOLLING: Unenforcing (ph) the law, law unenforcement (ph).JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: You know this, the reason of breaking the law, the reason that the Obama administration and others have not gone after local governments is, they think its good policy, Eric. They think it helps in terms of law enforcement, protecting communities, making people safer. When you have people in the immigrant community, legals (ph) and illegals, willing to cooperate with the local police, willing to testify and tell stories. I think what we're seeing here is, oh, illegal immigration is to blame for everything now including the death of the tragic death of this woman in San Francisco. But to me, I got to tell you in all honesty, looks like escapegoating (ph) vulnerable people. Are all black people to blame for all shootings in Chicago?BOLLING: No, no, but.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Nobody is saying that. Wait, wait, Juan.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: No one is saying that.GUTFELD: Nobody is blaming an entire group of people. We're talking about a policy. What caused this? In your mind, if you're saying that it wasn't a policy, if it wasn't sanctuary cities, then what caused this?WILLIAMS: It was a derelict to pick up a gun -- apparently he said he was on sleeping pills, but he who has a history being arrested of heroine.GUILFOYLE: But he is not a derelict. The derelict is somebody who hangs out on park benches and drinks beer.WILLIAMS: He wasn't hanging on a park bench.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: That is not who he is.WILLIAMS: Oh, what was he?GUILFOYLE: He had a significant criminal record. He is a murder.WILLIAMS: OK. But he was.GUILFOYLE: He is somebody who repeatedly broke the law and he's a recidivist and he shouldn't have been allowed back in. And this isn't about race. This is about obeying the laws of the United States of America. And it has nothing to do if you're black, white, Mexican.WILLIAMS: That's my point.GUILFOYLE: Chinese.WILLIAMS: Or an illegal.GUILFOYLE: No one cares.WILLIAMS: And nothing to do with legal or illegal or.BOLLING: But it does, Juan.WILLIAMS: American born.BOLLING: But it does, but it has to make something.WILLIAMS: Because the point is, if somebody kills me or shot my child, I wouldn't care who they were.BOLLING: Like here's why it matters. Because we are allowing sanctuary cities to let people go who would normally be incarcerated or deported. The whole point of this is that this gentleman -- this gentleman, forget it. This murderer decided to go to San Francisco because he knew he wasn't going to get deported.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: He's got seven felony convictions, five deportations. Yesterday, we talked about it, Juan. I'm going to do it for you. Here are the numbers. I promised you these numbers. Illegals represent 3 percent of the population. Do we agree on that?WILLIAMS: About.BOLLING: 11 million -- 319 million in the population, right? 38 percent of all federal convictions are by illegal immigrants. Not immigrants, illegal immigrants. They're convicted at 38 percent of all federal convictions, 3 percent of the population, 18 percent of drug trafficking convictions in America -- illegals, 3 percent of the population. 25 percent of all kidnappings in America are done by illegal immigrants. I have more. You want murders? 7 percent, you want drug possession? 56 percent of all drug possessions convictions are illegal immigrants.WILLIAMS: This is just not right. I don't know where you're getting these numbers.BOLLING: From the.WILLIAMS: But let me just say.BOLLING: From the United States Sentencing Bureau.WILLIAMS: No, let me just say.BOLLING: USSB.WILLIAMS: The GAAO -- the GAO has said that clearly, most of the illegal immigrants who are arrested in this country are arrested for what, Eric? Crossing the border, illegally.BOLLING: But that doesn't include this.WILLIAMS: 70 percent.BOLLING: These are drug trafficking, kidnapping, drug possession. You know, Juan, I'll give you those numbers, too.WILLIAMS: No, I'm just saying.BOLLING: 50 percent of the population.GUILFOYLE: But why are you allowed to break the law?BOLLING: They're arrested four times.WILLIAMS: You shouldn't enter illegally.GUILFOYLE: You get my point?WILLIAMS: Your point is.GUILFOYLE: Maybe I wanna go park in all the handicap spots.WILLIAMS: Well, you can't do that, but let me just say.GUILFOYLE: Why are they allowed to break the law?WILLIAMS: Look, nobody says you're allowed to break the law.GUILFOYLE: Why are we playing favorites?WILLIAMS: We're not playing favorites. In fact, we're trying to protect ourselves so that when a crime is committed by an illegal immigrant, other people in that community will testify, will give evidence, and we can stop and find the bad guys. That's what this is about.GUILFOYLE: That is one of the arguments that are conveniently and frequently used to justify a complete disregard for the laws that are on the books.WILLIAMS: You mean the illegal -- you may cross the border illegally.GUILFOYLE: I'm saying about oh, we just want people to testify and come forward. I mean, I was there. I wasn't having a situation where people like I'm worried about being deported, et cetera. People come forward to do the right thing. And they don't get deported when they testify in cases, sorry to tell you.WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'm going to tell you, people are afraid of it, Kimberly. People are afraid of being deported. And the reason we're having this discussion? Donald Trump. And you know what Donald Trump said? He didn't talk about people crossing the border illegally.BOLLING: No, no. You know, Juan.WILLIAMS: Or park illegally.BOLLING: We're having this discussion.WILLIAMS: Wait, wait. Let me finish -- what?BOLLING: Because Kate Steinle is dead.WILLIAMS: No. No, we're having.BOLLING: That's why.WILLIAMS: We're having this discussion because people are trying to demonize every illegal immigrant, into a rapist, a murder.GUILFOYLE: Nobody is accusing (ph) that.WILLIAMS: A criminal and drug dealer.GUTFELD: All right.WILLIAMS: I quote my friend, Donald Trump.GUTFELD: Nobody had to demonize this guy.WILLIAMS: No. He's a bad guy.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: He's a bad guy.GUTFELD: So that's what we're talking about.WILLIAMS: OK.GUTFELD: We're not talking about what happened before. We're talking about the fact that this man, this fiend, murdered a young woman. That has nothing to do with Trump.WILLIAMS: I would agree. This is a bad guy and we need to fix it. And so as Hillary Clinton, Barbara Boxer, Senator Klein --GUTFELD: We're all.WILLIAMS: All of them.GUTFELD: We're all through -- I think -- Isn't Hillary for sanctuary cities?BOLLING: Yes.WILLIAMS: She was. Now she's having second thoughts.GUTFELD: Well, how political of her.WILLIAMS: Yeah, I agree. PERINO: Because my point about the politics, catching up to the democrats. If I could make one point about this issue on bringing this, I know you got to go the next thing. It -- I actually think that it is more compassionate, and the argument could be made that if you are now changing your opinion about sanctuary cities, it is more compassionate to immigrant communities, legal immigrants, to deport and get the criminals out of their communities. That would be actually the more compassionate thing to do, in addition to the lawful thing to do.BOLLING: And the safe -- safer thing to do.PERINO: That's what I mean.BOLLING: Right.PERINO: That if you want those communities to thrive, if you want them to be able to go to good -- better schools and to have better jobs and better have like, safer streets, deporting the criminals is actually better. And that's the argument I'd use if you're changing your position.BOLLING: All right, hang in there one second. Kate Steinle will be laid to rest in the next hour. In the aftermath of her senseless murder, lots of finger pointing going on between the city of San Francisco, the county sheriff's office and ICE. Here's Mayor Ed Lee slamming the county sheriff.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ED LEE, MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO: Nothing in that law prevents or prohibits communication, notification, with our federal and state law enforcement officials. Do I need to educate somebody about how to pick up a phone?(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Well, Bill O'Reilly sent Jesse Watters to confront the San Francisco board of supervisors on their sanctuary city status. Jesse was armed with a picture of Kate Steinle.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JESSIE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: I'd like to show you a picture here. It's Kate Steinle. She was murdered by an illegal alien who had been deported five times and over six felony convictions. But for some reason, the city of San Francisco let this guy out. You guys aren't even looking. Look at the picture. Are you afraid? You guys don't have anything to say?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So K.G., I'm not sure that they could have done anything about it at that moment. But I -- it certainly is opening the debate, city councils of our country.GUILFOYLE: Well, absolutely they could have answered.BOLLING: Yeah?GUILFOYLE: I mean, I know.BOLLING: How?GUILFOYLE: Well, by opening their mouths and answering the question.BOLLING: Well. Yeah, I understood that opening their mouths.GUILFOYLE: But you know my point, they didn't want to say anything because they don't want to be on the record, because they don't want to be played on Fox News tonight. Simple as that. So this crazy glued their lips and somebody said next speaker. I know. I have spent hundreds of hours in that board of supervisor's room. They sit there. They are supposed to take questions from the people to answer them about what is going on in the city. That is the whole purpose of an open forum and an open democracy, to have the discussion. But they chose not to. I mean, yeah, they don't have any good answers, do they?BOLLING: Will there -- I don't know how you could possibly come up with -- what is the answer, Juan? Be the city council for San Francisco right now. Why are you a sanctuary city, Juan?WILLIAMS: Well, it's very interesting.BOLLING: What is that point of the city?WILLIAMS: A large population of immigrants and illegal immigrants, it's -- I saw an amazing, it's like a quarter of all the illegal immigrants in the country are in California. I didn't realize that, but anyway.BOLLING: So what do you? --WILLIAMS: But the answer is.BOLLING: What does that illegal population bring to San Francisco?WILLIAMS: What is the illegal population?BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: I think the -- well, you know what you and I think Donald Trump want to somehow imagine there are all these Mexicans who are running around and committing crimes. Let me tell you.BOLLING: Just answer my question.WILLIAMS: There are a lot of people who are Asians.BOLLING: Your city councilors.WILLIAMS: There a lot of people who are Irish.BOLLING: They're not the illegal ones. I'm talking about the illegal.WILLIAMS: Oh, they're not illegal.BOLLING: 80 percent of them are coming.WILLIAMS: You know what this is?BOLLING: From South America and Mexico.WILLIAMS: Let me tell you something.BOLLING: 80 percent.WILLIAMS: That is so knee jerk. I can't even -- don't know where to start.GUILFOYLE: But you know what, Juan. You like -- you break out in hives.WILLIAMS: Well, you know when people start.GUILFOYLE: When confronted with the facts.WILLIAMS: When people start maligning all Mexicans.GUILFOYLE: No one is making you (inaudible).WILLIAMS: Do you think its Mexicans that are the only illegal immigrants in the country?BOLLING: I was asking, as a city council member of San Francisco.GUILFOYLE: I love Mexican-Americans.WILLIAMS: Well, what is (inaudible)?GUILFOYLE: Amazing people. Great culture, great families. I don't like criminals. I like people who follow the law.WILLIAMS: No, so -- that's all I'm saying. And they come in all colors from all places around the world. It's not one group of people. That's not fair.BOLLING: Can we play that.GUTFELD: But I know -- I think -- he wasn't asking you that, Juan.WILLIAMS: No.GUTFELD: He was asking you how you would respond.WILLIAMS: Oh, I will respond if you want to.GUTFELD: I mean, but you didn't.WILLIAMS: Oh, I'm glad.GUTFELD: So I'm gonna say something. I'm thinking.WILLIAMS: No, he's talking about Mexicans. I don't care.GUTFELD: This is an interesting thing. Would you -- let's look at -- compare this.BOLLING: Greg, I'm -- can I do this once. I was talking about illegals, Juan. I wasn't.WILLIAMS: They're not.BOLLING: I wasn't talking about Mexicans, Canadians, Irish.WILLIAMS: Mexicans are not the only illegals.BOLLING: I was talking about the illegals. What does the city want with illegals? I can't figure it out. I'm sorry, Greg.GUTFELD: What's interesting is when there's a hot topic like this that affects republicans. Every single candidate is asked about it. Let say, gay marriage. The media will ask every single candidate anytime they get a republican alone. They're going to ask you about gay marriage or they will ask you about the Confederate flag. Will they do this about -- will they do this with sanctuaries and this horrible crime with the four candidates or any democrat in general? Will the media go there? Because they know they don't have an answer. Juan, it's proven that they don't have an answer.WILLIAMS: They don't have answer, yeah.GUTFELD: The way furloughs put Dukakis on the back foot and allowed George Bush to win -- that I am right, right? Little groggy. That's how the sanctuary business is gonna be the same for the current democratic crop.BOLLING: Dana?PERINO: I would say that on the legislative side of things because the last two presidents have failed to get comprehensive immigration reform done, that now that President Obama has taken the amnesty issue off the table because he has said, I'm going to do amnesty for these people by executive order. Hillary Clinton said she would double that. I think that the House republicans in their position now possibly, even working with the Senate they should pass a border security bill that they think they can live with and that would actually make a difference. And I would send that over, or at least pass it in the House, try to get it through the Senate and get it up to the president and let him be to decide if he's going to veto.BOLLING: Very good.WILLIAMS: Let me got -- let me just quickly respond to Gregory.GUTFELD: Please do, my friend.WILLIAMS: You know what? Republicans are the ones who have the problem here. I think there's lots of hypocrisy on the democrats' side. But remember Reince Priebus, the head of the RNC is calling who Donald Trump to say. You know what, you're hurting this party, now Trump said, oh, no that didn't happen. But believe me, that's a worry among republicans who are trying to reach out the Hispanics and get their votes.GUTFELD: I don't dispute that.WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: Well then, let's leave it on that one.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Coming up, things are heating up between 2016 contenders, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. The presidential hopefuls are duking (ph) it out on Twitter over who better understands the plight of the American worker. Details coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Well, the 2016 race is heating up with the war of words between presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. It all started yesterday with Bush's remarks about the American workforce in New Hampshire.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEB BUSH, 2016 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My aspiration for the country and I believe we can achieve it is 4 percent growth as far as I could see, which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and through their productivity gain more income for their families. That's the only way we're going to get out of this rut that we're in.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: In response, Hillary tweeted, ""Anyone who believes Americans aren't working hard enough hasn't met enough American workers."" Bush later clarified his comments saying, they were taken out of context. Tweeting Clinton back, ""Anyone who discounts 6.5 million people stuck in part-time work and seeking full-time jobs hasn't listened to working Americans at Hillary Clinton."" I mean, now this is the new like, Ultimate Fighting Championship on Twitter, right? They just like tweet each other to death until one passes out and needs a Gatorade or some replenishment. What do you make of these numbers?BOLLING: So the 4 percent comment is where I think Jeb was really focusing in on and that's a big one. 4 percent growth going forward, I think he said to the foreseeable future. That's realistic. That's great. That's optimistic. But you know how it, like on TV sometimes, you do write a script, you do three things. You know, this, this and this.GUILFOYLE: Like in the Fastest 7.BOLLING: Whatever -- but we have a lot of times we think in threes, so we talk about in threes. So he said, labor participation rate, longer hours, and productivity. The problem is if you just did the first one. Get the labor participation rate that would probably solve his 4 percent problem or already working as harder than we've ever worked with. Putting in more hours and we're more productive than we've ever been in the history of America. So he added two things that Hillary jumped on. She saw -- it was a mistake, it was an error, it's an unforced error and she took it and exploited it. If she just stayed with the first one, he -- you know he had. He had it right there.GUILFOYLE: All right and what difference does it make to vote Hillary Clinton, Dana?PERINO: I think the labor participation rate is something that we do talk about a lot. I mean, we've had the slowest recovery from a recession, and the economic growth -- 4 percent is actually, pretty modest, actually. But we would love to have that in America now. The labor participation rate being -- I think what you're talking about, Eric, it's like just at all- time lows and so the country needs more -- people what to be working more. And I think also it's.BOLLING: More people.PERINO: More people working.BOLLING: Right.PERINO: Now, some people, if you are in a -- stuck in a part-time job situation because your employer basically doesn't want to have more full- time workers, because of the consequences of that from additional regulations.GUILFOYLE: And Obamacare.PERINO: That's was like a problem. Here's the thing, though. It could be the first election by Twitter. It's going to be.BOLLING: Twitter (ph).PERINO: Kind of unsatisfying. I have a feeling, 140 characters. But it shows the importance of social media. So it used to be that television could drive social media, it's now -- it's the other way around. Social media is driving the coverage of the campaigns. So that's where you have to be and you have to be there fast. I think that Jeb Bush's team showed a little bit of agility today, as you see their Instagram piece about this issue. It's clever and it's smart and it's quick. But the anxiety Americans feel about the economy, they've got to be better and be prepared to have to deal with her on a much faster basis.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. There was pretty quick response. So like you said, the agility was there. What do you think about that? It seems like these are the two. You know they are going head-to-head, Clash of the Titans already.GUTFELD: Well, maybe, but -- to comment on this new politics of Twitter, which I despise.GUILFOYLE: Thank you.GUTFELD: One, you say something that is generally embedded in a larger conversation; two, it's taken out of context; three, clarify, rinse and repeat. The great thing about Hillary is nothing ever gets taken out of context because she never says anything. And if she happens to speak, the press fake partial deafness. But I hate -- you know what's interesting about -- if Twitter didn't exist, this debate would never occur in person because the person would say no, that's not what I meant. I didn't mean that. I was talking about, you know, instead of working part-time, they'd be working full time. She knew what he meant, but you pretend not to know.PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: When you're on Twitter. Because on Twitter, there's no such thing as context, you could take anything you want and turn it into whatever.GUILFOYLE: And pull it.GUTFELD: It sucks.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. All right, but you're on it. But OK.GUTFELD: Not for long.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: That's what he keeps saying, it's like Groundhog Day. I'm getting off Twitter. I'm going to quit you.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: OK. Juan, are you better this flock (ph)?WILLIAMS: Well, you know.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: I just got -- I just think, you know, this is politics, Twitter or elsewhere. Where people -- I think intentionally play gotcha games.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: So I don't think there was really a gotcha here. I thought it was pretty clear to me, he didn't mean anything but labor participation rates. But of course, he did slightly mistake. But the interesting part of the politics to me is, so where did the attacks come from? You guys are talking about Hillary Clinton. Of course, but Ted Cruz? Ted Cruz's guys come out and say, oh, this is just like Mitt Romney. You don't understand what a gaffe you've made. You're out of touch with the working people in America. This is Ted Cruz.GUTFELD: Right.BOLLING: Yeah, but.WILLIAMS: And then, hold on, hold on. And then here comes, guess who? Bernie Sanders, and Bernie Sanders says, oh, you don't understand what it means to have decent wages and it's the economy that's the problem, not the labor participation. I'm thinking, wow, Cruz and Sanders are teaming up.GUTFELD: Come on, that's the ticket.BOLLING: He just wants to be because.WILLIAMS: That's the ticket?BOLLING: That his is the leader. He is the frontrunner. And obviously, everyone wants to take the frontrunner down a notch or two. So Cruz points out something that he found wrong in what Jeb said and that's.WILLIAMS: Well, it just clear.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: And how about this, we got a little bit of that gotcha because oh, no she didn't in February of 2014. Listen to what Hillary had to say. Oh, I have to read it? I can't see that far.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: This is about -- I don't wear my glasses.GUTFELD: Do you want me to do it?GUILFOYLE: Clinton pointed to issues with small business of 50 or more providing coverage to their employees, and businesses moving people from full-time work to part-time work to try to avoid contributing to their health care. Quote, ""As issues that should be addressed."" That's a little nugget from CNN. So we get to the respond. Bolling, you can't see it, either.BOLLING: No, no. I see.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Oh, how that it applies?GUILFOYLE: You are really old.BOLLING: Why does that apply to this? It didn't --GUILFOYLE: This is what she.BOLLING: Just I don't get that.GUILFOYLE: This is what she said in 2014.PERINO: Talking about the labor participation right.GUILFOYLE: Right? Late edition.PERINO: And what I was saying is.WILLIAMS: Yeah, part-time.PERINO: Part-time issue.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: No -- yeah. No -- I mean, I understand because -- they're like explaining to me why we read that comment. The bottom line here, he was right with labor participation, right. He was wrong with hours worked and he was wrong with productivity. Those things are very strong. So let's, you know.WILLIAMS: But I don't think he meant that, though, you know.GUTFELD: It's the nature, though, of modern politics.WILLIAMS: That's what I say.GUTFELD: Each republican has to be on their toes because they have a big fat target on their back that.BOLLING: Especially if you're leading.GUTFELD: Yea, that's right.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUTFELD: And Hillary doesn't need it.GUTFELD: Yeah, but Jeb is much more willing to engage and to answer questions and to be prepared and well-versed on the issues. This will come to be a very significant advantage on his behalf.PERINO: And remember, this is.GUILFOYLE: Hillary is not going to be ready.PERINO: Remember, she didn't write that tweet.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: OK.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: It was like she's got better staffers than she is a candidate.GUTFELD: Yeah, that's true.GUILFOYLE: That is it right there. So what is she gonna do? Like I get by with a little help from my friends and like bring them all up on the stage in the debate or put them in the podium?PERINO: Am I right? You got to have to trust your people that your social media for you.GUILFOYLE: All right, (inaudible). Next on The Five, brand-new Confederate flags developments in South Carolina where Governor Nikki Haley just made a historic move on the issue. Details, when we return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Big news in South Carolina. Moments ago, Governor Nikki Haley signed a bill, allowing for the removal of the Confederate flag from the state house grounds. The governor explained what will happen next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NIKKI HALEY, SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR: Tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m., we will see the Confederate flag come down. We are a state that believes in tradition. We're a state that believes in history. We're a state that believes in respect. So we will bring it down with dignity, and we will make sure that it is put in its rightful place.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: The governor's signature comes after both the Republican- controlled House and Senate in South Carolina passed the bill with overwhelming support.Greg, are you surprised?GUTFELD: It's got to kill the Democrats to see the Republicans take down their flag. Hat tip John Gabriel.I hear they're replacing the flag, though, with posters of Donald Trump. So I don't know if it's a win-lose.But you know what? One point -- I think I'm OK with this. It's not my -- it's not my game. But America is in scary shape, and so is the world. You've got China imploding. Europe's a mess. Is it not a coincidence this is happening, when America tends to its social justice garden, that we've somehow stopped looking outward; and we're too busy looking inward to correct the shame of our past? Is that a good question, Juan? You're pondering.WILLIAMS: Well, I'm pondering because I listen to you.GUTFELD: I love it when you listen to me.WILLIAMS: Well, I do. But I must say, to me it's stunning. You know, I saw somebody quoted as saying -- this was a black person -- that they never thought they'd see it in their lifetime. I think that's the way I feel, like I never thought we'd get past the whole argument about heritage and tradition, and people would own up to it.What do you think?PERINO: A transformative moment led by a Republican who's an Indian American, whose family came here and worked really hard; and they raised an amazing family, and she was able to lead this effort. And...GUTFELD: But she's an immigrant.BOLLING: A legal one. A little one.WILLIAMS: Hey, Eric...BOLLING: ... Juan...WILLIAMS: She's not Mexican. Oh, my God.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: She was actually born here. She's an American.BOLLING: So Republican House, Senate and Republican governor signing. Can we -- can we move on?I did learn something today. I did learn that the flag didn't fly above the state house until the 100th anniversary after the fact. And it stayed as a protest to some anti -- some desegregation efforts. So you know what? OK. So take the flag down.WILLIAMS: Move on. I'm interested to hear you say that. You mean, just move on because you feel like it's a defeat in the culture wars or something?GUILFOYLE: What?BOLLING: No. I think the issue is over. It's been decided at the state level.WILLIAMS: I just think -- I think it's an amazing moment in American history. You disagree?GUILFOYLE: I didn't say I disagree. No, I think that she showed tremendous, you know, courage and fortitude and led the way on this. And I think it's an important moment. And I like that, you know, Nikki Haley did it. What are you going to say now? What are you going to say now about the Republicans? Huh?WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's a real positive thing about Republicans.All right. So let me just -- let me tell you something interesting about the Democrats. Bernie Sanders is on the radio, right. And Bernie Sanders says the nation should apologize for slavery.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Nobody in this generation is involved in slavery. But as a nation, slavery is one of the abominations that our country has experienced. There's no excuse. What can we say about it? As a nation -- I don't think as a president -- but as a nation we have got to apologize for slavery.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Kimberly, do we need to apologize?GUILFOYLE: No, I don't think we need to apologize. I mean, we've spent every single day apologizing for something, right? I mean, not to say this isn't a significant moment. But this is -- you know, this is his moment. We're talking about Bernie Sanders every day. I want to apologize for that. But other than that, I mean, he's of course, going to say this. This is who he is. So I think it's consistent with his politics, with his ideology and the idea of, like, American shame.GUTFELD: Juan.WILLIAMS: I'm sorry.GUTFELD: I think Bernie should apologize for himself. He's the last remaining American socialist. Talking about clinging to a dangerous, harmful, deadly path.But I do agree with him on one point. All of humanity should apologize for slavery. Earliest records from 1760 B.C. show that it was an established institution. There were black slaves. There were white slaves. There were Christian slaves. There were Muslim slaves. There were slaves in the British isles. There were slaves in Canada. There were slaves in Europe. In Mauritania right now, there's 600,000 slaves. Right now. Should they be apologizing to Bernie Sanders? It's an ugly scar for the earth.WILLIAMS: It is. Dana, I just wanted to talk the politics for a second. Why is Bernie Sanders doing this? Is it all about his need for reaching out to the black and minority vote in the Democratic Party?PERINO: I actually think that Bernie Sanders is just being Bernie Sanders.GUILFOYLE: Right. Thank you.PERINO: He just raised, in a reporting requirement for the campaign. He raised $15 million. OK. That's a lot of money! There is actually support for him. He believes in a form -- this is an issue about a formal apology from the United States that would be written and signed off and sworn to. And I would ask you, Juan, do you -- do you agree with that?GUILFOYLE: Do you want it?PERINO: Do you think that a formal apology from the United States government would help the issue?WILLIAMS: No. Not to me. So the question is what is it about? Somebody the other day said Obama should apologize. I thought the first black president?BOLLING: No, no. The Democrats should apologize.WILLIAMS: Why?BOLLING: Because Republicans are the ones who got slavery abolished, and they also got voting rights for African Americans. So Democrats. And they voted against it.WILLIAMS: I think we didn't even -- we didn't quite have Republicans and Democrats when the Constitution was signed, you know. I mean...BOLLING: ... amendment.WILLIAMS: All right. But I'm just saying, this was a Founding Fathers thing. You know, I wasn't even fully human; I was 3/5 human.BOLLING: Three-fifths.WILLIAMS: Three-fifths. So it's a problem for us as Americans.GUILFOYLE: Three-fifths?WILLIAMS: Three-fifths. I hope I'm 3/5 cute enough for you.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my.WILLIAMS: Anyway, directly ahead, pop star Ariana Grande is singing a different tune after being caught on tape in a doughnut shop saying she hates America. Wow! But is the singer's apology enough? Now, get ready for this, because Greg's up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: There's so much to learn from Ariana Grande, the singer who besmirched a doughnut shop on the Fourth, saying she hates America while licking other people's doughnuts. Roll it, Clem.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ARIANA GRANDE, POP SINGER: What the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) is that? I hate Americans. I hate America. That's disgusting.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Oh, man.The lessons in no real order. One, Grande is only 22, which in pop star years is six. You divide the age by 2 and then subtract five. Six-year- olds lick things, and they hate things because they're dumb. To ruin your life, date a backup singer like the guy who egged her on that day. Called the Federline law. It's foolproof and proof of fools.If you want to apologize without apologizing, say you're sorry to people close to you. It's like apologizing to your car after running over an old lady. Cite concern for the greater good.Here Ariana claims she was upset over fat people and lectures us on America's childhood obesity rate, which her assistants likely Googled. She wrote this after buying doughnuts.That's like lecturing us on safe sex after sleeping with Charlie Sheen.As for licking doughnuts meant for the public, isn't that a crime? That doughnut should sue her for assault. Who knows what she gave it.And her hate for America? That's the phony edginess of the fake cool, a moron substitute for intellect. I say boycott her music. But is it music?Speaking of, she canceled on the MLB All-Stars, saying she'll make -- make it up to her fans there soon. Fans, how cute that she thought there'd be more than one.Adopting victim status, she says she's having oral surgery instead. True, it's going to take a team of surgeons to remove her foot from her mouth. Actually, she's having a wisdom tooth taken out. Clearly, she's not using it.Do you buy, K.G., the wisdom tooth argument? Or do you think she knows...GUILFOYLE: No, I think she's having her tongue removed.GUTFELD: Really?GUILFOYLE: Going to be helpful. We'll see if she can still sing.You know, obviously, this is an unfortunate moment. I don't know if she was, like, hating on doughnuts, hating on America. Said it was taken out of context. It wasn't. We know exactly what she was saying, what she was doing. It's disappointing. Because I think America has been pretty good to her.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: So what is her beef with America?GUTFELD: On July 4, Eric. She should go to jail just for that.Well, she's being investigated.BOLLING: Yes, right.GUTFELD: Malicious licking.PERINO: Licked the doughnuts?BOLLING: That's pretty gross.GUILFOYLE: If somebody bought it and ate it.BOLLING: That's not the grossest thing that goes on in a doughnut shop. It just happened to be caught on tape.She can't do the MLB thing. She would obviously get booed. Very good choice not to do it. But to blame a tooth? She could just say, ""Look, I made a mistake. Let's back out of it.""She can sing though, Greg. I'm going to tell you, she can sing. Ariana Grande can sing.GUTFELD: I've never heard a single song by her.BOLLING: Very good.GUILFOYLE: She can blow. That's what they say.BOLLING: Well, that's disgusting.GUILFOYLE: No, sing really well.GUTFELD: Dana, could her saliva be viewed as a weapon? There are more germs in the human mouth than there are on the toilet seat. I made that up.PERINO: If she's allowed to go in and lick doughnuts and I can't take my dog out on the -- outside a patio in New York City and let him sit down with me while I have a meal.GUTFELD: Well, I don't know if she's allowed to do that.GUILFOYLE: Who did that to Jasper?GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: All of New York. They're trying to change the law, though, which would be good.GUTFELD: Juan, I want to read a tweet here from Susan...GUILFOYLE: Sarandon.GUTFELD: ... Sarandon in defense of Ariana. She writes -- show that thing -- ""Today lick a doughnut in solidarity -- solidarity with Ariana Grande, a sweet, talented true American."" Juan, will you be licking a doughnut? I brought one for you.WILLIAMS: Did you, buddy?GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Oh, man.GUTFELD: It's glazed.WILLIAMS: It's glazed?PERINO: Don't do it, Juan. As your press secretary.WILLIAMS: That's right. My advisor tells me that you're a trickster.GUILFOYLE: No, you can lick it if you eat it.WILLIAMS: You know what? I bet Greg licked it before!GUILFOYLE: Did you?GUTFELD: You're holier than thou.WILLIAMS: I'm holier than thou? I'm not going to do it, because he licked it.GUTFELD: No, I did not lick it.GUILFOYLE: Why are you such a baby?WILLIAMS: Oh, you're licking the -- hey...GUTFELD: All right.WILLIAMS: Wait a second. That's...GUTFELD: Maybe I shouldn't have purchased that.WILLIAMS: The part that amazed me was...GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: ... how can she say now that she is going to lead a campaign against obesity?GUTFELD: Yes, that's her cover. If you pick a cause, you can get away with anything.WILLIAMS: But obesity in a doughnut shop?PERINO: Remember, in her statement, she says, ""We need to do more to educate ourselves and our children about the dangers of overeating. We need to demand more from our food industry.""GUTFELD: Yes. But the point is, she's learned this. This is learned behavior. When you're in trouble, find a cause and use it as cover.BOLLING: She should have just eaten it: ""I made a mistake. My boyfriend dared me to do it. I did it."" Blame it on him. She needs a better choice of boyfriends.GUTFELD: Behind every pop singer is a loser boyfriend. Who forces her to do things.GUILFOYLE: Next time could you get me the ones with the sprinkles on top?WILLIAMS: By the way, what is this about doughnut shops? I happen to be a big fan of doughnuts, not pre-licked ones like the one Gregory offered me.GUILFOYLE: He didn't lick it.WILLIAMS; Why would you put down doughnut shops? You said things going on behind the scene at doughnut shops.BOLLING: I mean restaurants. You have any idea what goes on?GUTFELD: I love doughnuts.BOLLING: What?GUTFELD: I love doughnuts. Doughnuts are amazing.GUILFOYLE: Bolling just drinks his calories. He doesn't eat any food.GUTFELD: All right. We've got to go now.Up next, could skipping breaks and working long hours really be hurting your business productivity? We'll reveal how to best maximize your time at the workplace. This tease brought to you by a robot.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Hi. Do you ever have a hard time getting caught up on your business ""to do"" list? Well, it could be your habits that are keeping you from achieving your workplace goals.According to Entrepreneur magazine, some bad habits you should stop to improve productivity include checking your e-mail constantly; scheduling weekly status meetings -- yes, I hate those; working long hours; eating lunch at your desk; and multitasking. These are all things that we all do here every day. Do you think any of those things are holding you back?GUTFELD: They left out a tip for more productivity. IAE. I abbreviate everything. BIST. Because I save time. TISATML. Try it sometime, and you'll thank me later.PERINO: Really good tip. That's a very good tip.GUTFELD: I wasted a lot of time explaining it.PERINO: Thank you.GUILFOYLE: Wait a second. Checking e-mail constantly. Isn't that part of our job? We're supposed to check our e-mail and read all the...PERINO: Well, the advice is that -- this person is saying -- is that -- they don't work in breaking news, so it might be a little different. Is that if you're on your phone all the time always checking e-mail, you get into the e-mail rabbit hole. So what you want to do is just have a specific time between, like, 1 and 2 that you do e-mails and maybe between...GUILFOYLE: Well, we can't do that.PERINO: This is not necessarily applicable to us.GUILFOYLE: I'm just trying to learn and grow.WILLIAMS: But I must say, I do not. And people around here, especially young people who are the producers and things, they think I'm a jerk.PERINO: Because you don't respond?WILLIAMS: Call me. If you really have something to tell me, give me a holler.GUILFOYLE: You're supposed to read the updates, Juan, so that you know what's happening. You know, like, ""Oh...(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: No, no. If I know I'm...GUILFOYLE: ""... OK, this is for (ph) me.""WILLIAMS: If I have something to do I will engage. But am I supposed to look at the e-mail all day long, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Correct.PERINO: Well, not according to this magazine.Eric, do you have any recommendations for habits that people should drop?BOLLING: Maybe the social media stuff. Maybe the Twitter and the Facebook and Snapchat now. It's so addictive that I find if I'm trying to write something, write a blog or something...PERINO: You've got to put it away.BOLLING: ... on the show and then I'm like checking whatever. Twitter or Snapchat. Engaging and then going back. You just -- you lose your train of thought. It's distracting.GUILFOYLE: But that's because you have ADD.BOLLING: Put it away or take your -- one hour a day.GUILFOYLE: Maybe it's been created. It's generational, and it's -- we're a product of...GUTFELD: We're rewiring our brains. It's not good.GUILFOYLE: I have to tell you something. All of this I think is pretty much wrong, OK? This is the worst list in America, pretty much. Having coffee for breakfast.PERINO: That's the only thing for breakfast. That's what they're saying, is that you should have more than just coffee.GUTFELD: That's my breakfast.BOLLING: Me, too.GUILFOYLE: Spending too much time eating a lot of breakfast instead of sucking it down and running at the same time. You're probably not winning.PERINO: You eat breakfast.GUILFOYLE: I eat whatever I can run and find that's like a leftover. I just devour the rest of whatever, like, Ronan didn't eat. Down it with coffee. Run. That's what I do. I mean, I don't recommend my habits, actually.PERINO: There's all sorts of...GUTFELD: Have you had a physical lately?GUILFOYLE: Yes, I did.GUTFELD: I had a -- I had a procedure yesterday.GUILFOYLE: I just had a complete blood count. Everything done. Everything's been checked out.GUTFELD: I had the little camera.GUILFOYLE: Peeked under the hood.GUTFELD: I had the little camera.PERINO: Let me ask you something.BOLLING: Oh, boy.GUTFELD: That's what I did yesterday.PERINO: Can I ask one serious question? It says here that you should not eat lunch at your desk, because that decreases productivity.GUTFELD: I've never not. That's all I do is eat at my desk. There are things in my keyboard that are so disgusting.GUILFOYLE: It totally bugs me when people are like, ""Oh, I'm out for lunch."" Why?PERINO: Don't do lunch.Do you eat lunch at your desk?BOLLING: The routine is no breakfast, coffee, and then it's like a bag of pretzels and a bag of peanuts during the day at my desk and then wait until dinner.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. You're like the zoo.BOLLING: What?GUILFOYLE: You're like the animals at the zoo.BOLLING: The zoo?GUILFOYLE: You like eating peanuts.PERINO: That was a fascinating ""E"" block. I like this real estate. Keep me parked right here. All right. ""One More Thing"" up next.GUILFOYLE: This is like...(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Time for ""One More Thing."" K.G. kicks it off.GUILFOYLE: Oh, yes, I'm very ready for you. Are you ready for all these baby girls? They're absolutely delicious. So cute.America's first all-girl quintuplets, they are finally back together again, now that the last baby has returned home from the hospital. Feast your eyes on Ava, Olivia, Hazel, Riley and Parker. They were born back in April, weighing between 2 pounds and 2 pounds six ounces each. They're very cute. So they're color coded, right, with the little bandannas and things like that.And then, if you can believe this, they go through 40 bottles and 60 diapers a day. Play it.GUTFELD: Like me.GUILFOYLE: Yes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Having four at home, you're extremely busy. It's still a lot of kids. And so, you know, we just couldn't find, you know, the amount of time that we wanted to keep, you know, going back up there to the hospital every day. So we're just thrilled to finally have them all home.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: That makes five. It's like the new starting lineup for America's girl soccer team, right? Maybe? Or basketball, maybe?Sure.BOLLING: D.PERINO: OK. That was very cute.GUILFOYLE: Thank you.PERINO: By the way. I'm irritated with the government. Because now the government is not even able to trust the government anymore.Do you remember we've been telling you this story about the Chinese that supposedly hacked into the American government computers to the Office of Personnel Management. They basically hold all the information for anyone who worked in the government that might have applied for a background check.Initially, Obama administration, the White House, confirmed 4.2 million people were affected. They had to revise that today. Because guess what? It's larger than that. It was 21.5 million people are affected by this. This has huge consequences. I don't see how we don't see this as an act of cyber war. And I think that the White House should actually have to be forced to answer for this -- for these problems.BOLLING: Twenty-one million?PERINO: It's like basically easier to announce who wasn't affected.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: All righty. Remember when Hillary Clinton said she was of the people, for the people and by the people? So she got this Scooby van. Take a look at the Scooby van. Right? Because she's one of the people. Everyone's chasing her around.Well, look what the America's -- America Rising PAC uncovered. Hillary Clinton getting aboard her $10 million Lear jet in Iowa.GUILFOYLE: Explains that.BOLLING: I believe that was a few days ago. The only reason why we know it's hers is because we can see the blue pant suit underneath the wing right there. Ten million. Of the people for the people -- Greg.GUTFELD: Here's some...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Media News, now with fluoride.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I did this interview with RealClearPolitics. They do this thing where they take you around in a car?PERINO: Yes. The Commute.GUTFELD: Yes, The Commute. It's interesting, because this guy had never driven, Tom Bevin, in New York City. You should watch this. Go to RealClearPolitics and just watch how terrified I am throughout this entire thing. I have no idea what I'm saying. It's part one and part two, but I'm sweating, and I'm actually crying at a point.GUILFOYLE: You look pale in there.GUTFELD: I'm terrified this guy can't drive.PERINO: Tom Bevin's a good driver.GUTFELD: But he -- not in New York City.GUILFOYLE: The seat belt looks very tight on you.GUTFELD: Oh, thank you. Awful person.GUILFOYLE: Tight and sweaty.BOLLING: You're up, Juan.WILLIAMS: Oh, oh, that was too good. Poor Gregory.Anyway, on Wednesday a federal judge upheld cancellation of the federal patent and trademark of the Washington NFL football team's nickname. I won't say it. But anyway, this is the biggest legal and public relations battle loss for the team yet. And it doesn't go into effect until the team has exhausted its appeals. But let me tell you.BOLLING: Says right there. It says ""the Redskins"" right there.WILLIAMS: I'm not going to use that slur.BOLLING: We've got to go. We have four seconds lefts left.

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 14, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Greg Gutfeld along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Bob Beckel, Jesse Watters and she kayaks in a tea pot, it's Dana Perino, this is ""The Five.""As war and pestilence rage, what's the White House up to? It's not ISIS, it's ice flows.Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel just released his department's global warming plan and he goes full-Gore, saying -- quote -- ""Climate change is a long-term trend, but with wise planning and risk mitigation now, we can reduce adverse impacts downrange.""This would be fine if these people could multitask, but they can't even single task. So here we are ducking real danger to chase an easier unknown. This on the heels of a major study showing that we've greatly overestimated how much greenhouse gas is left in the atmosphere.Now we already know the climate change has paused the last 18 years, so the more unsettled the science, the more fervent this politicized fear. And the only things heating up these days are the priests of planetary panic.Look, I'm all for saving the Earth, but it's easier to tackle climate change than urgent evil. Consider these major threats: ISIS, Ebola, Putin and why were they missed. Since Mr. Obama prefers world concern over America's enemies, climate change became the life preserver for every Obama flack. So he's flanked by appeasers who knew for career survival to focus on our internal flaws, identity, gluttony, energy, not terror or security.It's two sides of a dreary coin called ""American Derangement Syndrome."" Lost in our own self-loathing we missed those who truly hate us. No wonder we're vulnerable, because we chose our navels over our navy.So basically -- Jesse, I'm going to state the obvious, I think you know, it's good to be concerned about the planet, but it's easier to be concerned about the planet and scold skeptics who confront evil and want to fight war instead.JESSE WATTERS, GUEST CO-HOST: It's very convenient for them to pull us off at this time. I don't understand, climate change creates terrorism, last time I checked, all the terrorists came from a desert. OK, it's very hot there and it's been hot there for hundreds of years, I don't think the terrorists care too much that it's really hot. But -- I think the main point is what they're saying is, blame America, because it is we're burning fossil fuels, we're creating a terrorism, it's not the terrorist fault, it's our fault. So it's -- we want to kill terrorist, we should all (inaudible) just go green and the problem solved, but the president has a history of politicizing these departments. Remember, NASA was supposed to be for Muslim outreach, remember that? The IRS targeting conservatives, NSA going after Fox news, what I'm worried about though, is why is Hagel in Peru in the middle of a war talking about the ocean? And you know, what's going on here and why is Susan Rice out there doing the Sunday shows.GUTFELD: It makes no sense.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Jesse makes a good point that -- I think they liked -- they're almost more interested in finding a root cause for terror than the actual cause we know to be true. So instead of saying, ""OK, radical Islam is the reason why there is terror"", they rather say, ""It's the fact that -- you know, we use coals.""DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Right, so that -- they don't get to the root cause.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: Of the problem. And Twitter is a very unsatisfying way to govern. Now I can understand it helps the young people love it.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: They see a tweet like, ""Climate change, oh yeah good, they're good, oh yeah, good, good and it's like the -- you know squirrels in a disco ballroom.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: It's like a raccoon in a room full of disco balls, have you heard that?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I do have a good point, though.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: The administration admitted today that they are holding their -- the president's nominee for attorney general until after the midterms, because they're worried about some sort of political thing. Why then, don't they have the presence of mind to say, ""No, why don't we hold on to this little climate thing for a couple of weeks."" Why couldn't they do that? Because actually climate, they think works in a political favor of good attorney general who would call balls and strikes as he sees it, it's not working their favor and their opinion.Also in the Chuck Hagel point, whatever happened to the Chuck Hagel of 1997, when he was the senator of Nebraska, his sponsor was Robert -- the late Robert Byrd. The Byrd-Hagel resolution which basically said, America will not be held to any sort of Kyoto standard that I want to do, unless China, India and the other major developing economies in the world, have to do it as well. So if -- Chuck Hagel for 1997, it was more worried about China as a senator than he is worried about China as secretary of defense, which I think is strange.GUTFELD: Yeah, because -- well, it's about his job. It's about the piece -- President Obama picked him because he knew he would do what president Obama wanted, that's my feeling. I want to throw to a tweet, Kimberly, this is from a fan. And that was interesting that the -- this is what she had to say, I think this crystallize it perfectly, ""Imagine being a Kurd waiting for airstrikes to save their lives and then seeing a tweet sent out from Obama on climate change, #TheFive"", that's important. Isn't that a problem here, its priorities?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah, it would be OK if we were in the seventh grade and this is what like, the weird kid in the back road that was distracted and not paying attention, with thinking he was in art class and it was actually reading class, but it's not. This is his administration that seems to completely lose focus, they have massive political ADD. So instead of focusing on ISIS and the incredible holds that they are making in strike, taking over territory in Iraq, in Syria, the beheadings, the mass murderers, the -- you know, inflaming (ph) of women, the marrying and taking 8-year-old girl and saying that it is still right under their religion, to be able to put them in this force marriages. Why are they so distracted and they cannot focus on what's going on in the world, it's on fire and they want to talk about ice cubes.GUTFELD: Bob, I think you said earlier today that you have a fact for us, now we're looking forward to this. I'm shocked.BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: That's not very nice to say it.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Well, think of the world's concerns, take priority over American security then you seem no problem with what they're doing?BECKEL: No, no, no. Listen -- you know we -- we just set a fundamental difference on this. I happen to think that climate change is much more important than ISIS, much more.GUILFOYLE: And china?BECKEL: The China?GUILFOYLE: Yeah, you're always talking about China.BECKEL: Yeah, in a long run I think it probably is. I mean look, you have your facts, we got our facts on our side and we're a lot more to do but that's all right. We're not going to agree on this. It's not worth arguing about anymore.GUTFELD: But it is worth arguing.WATTERS: You said ISIS is more of a threat -- you said climate change is more of a threat than ISIS?BECKEL: Sure, by far.WATTERS: When has climate change beheaded anybody?BECKEL: Well, you know there's been typhoons and tornadoes and.(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: Yeah, that's right.GUTFELD: There weren't any climate scientists don't say that.(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: All right. If you -- you know we still argue about it, but it is just what I have to believe and I have right to believe it.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Right to believe that. So would you say it's more like a faith?BECKEL: A faith? No, not at all, listen there are so many more people around the world who believe that climate change is a threat than you all.GUTFELD: So that's the -- is that called -- is the really -- is that called the fact and where did you get that fact?BECKEL: I was not talking about fact in this segment, another segment we're talking about. And by the way, I will bring you in tomorrow a fact, I'll show you that ISIS now has less territory than they did two weeks ago.WATTERS: Are being slaughter and they worried about climate change? Are they worried about it?BECKEL: Jesse, I don't think they probably do sit back and worry about it. But do you worry about it?(CROSSTALK)WWATTERS: I actually like to think about global warming, I think it will help works on my tan. You know, I like it when.BECEKLE: It doesn't work if that's what you suggested. Jesse, let me put this way, I think that -- you know, you go to these beaches with your tennis shirt on and you have this five day to cactus (ph) tell about the people about infectious, go ask them about climate change see if they.WATTERS: I will and I have, and they have no idea what's going on either and you kind of sound jealous that you want to come with me to the beach.BECKEL: I'd love to.WATTERS: Yeah.PERINO: Oh my God, that would be -- that would be -- that would be gold, please, please make that happen. BECKEL: I'd love to.GUILFOYLE: I have to cover my face.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Will O'Reilly approve that?WATTERS: I don't think so, I would approve that.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I think Bob which show can start this.PERINO: Do you think it's going to cramp your style?WATTERS: I don't know the girls might run in the other direction.GUTFELD: All right. And Dana, try and come up with something interesting to say at this point.PERINO: OK. I am -- I am not against the department of defense doing long- range planning as they.GUTFELD: True.PERINO: OK. Because they have to spin multiple plates at the same time and that means spinning is like make up things.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: I mean that if there just -- they have a lot of thing that they have to deal with all at once, and long-range planning is critically important for the world, I'm for that. But when the defense department says that ISIS is the worst terror threat that the world has ever seen.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: It does stand to reason that that should be the priority, I don't think that unreasonable. But also, to Bob's point about most people in the world think that climate change is the biggest issue that's' actually -- I think the most people in the world are worried about where they're going to get their next meal.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And also the fact that they don't have electricity which means that they can't read, they can't educate their children, they are dying because of, as you point it out, the way that they have to fuel their lives and with.GUTFELD: Coal would save millions of lives.PERINO: Coal will save things. And also we suppose to facilitate growth. I think the most important thing here that we missed on this climate change debate is the economic growth will actually fill the chances for us to find alternatives that are more affordable and they could be widespread and said thankful.BECKEL: Just for the record, I did not stay that it was the number one issue. I said more people believe a climate change is a problem and I think that's right.GUILFOYLE: Just fact-check yourself.PERINO: He fact-check me.BECKEL: I fact-check Dana.GUTFELD: But I'd like to see the stands for that. This is President Obama, I have an -- sound on tape here, with military leaders today talking about the long term campaign. Please now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So far we've seen some important successes, stopping ISIL's advance on our bill, saving many civilians from (inaudible) retaking the most of them, destroying ISIL targets and fighters across Iraq and Syria, we're still at the early stages. As with any military effort, there will be days of progress and that there are going to be periods of setback.(END OF VIDE CLIP)GUTFELD: So Kimberly, ISIL's ability either ISIS's ability or ice-ice, as I like to call them, to project power is -- is to terrorize with small numbers. It's their brutality and their will that is driving them. Compare that to, say, our will or President Obama's will or President Obama's tweeting. You see the difference?GUILFOYLE: Yeah. I -- I agree, and just listen to the tone I mean, I get more emotions out of my, you know, average book on tape. It's just this story of relaxing low, put you to sleep like what's going on? Things this are high stakes, this -- I think it's the greatest terror threat that we have faith. Because they have now sharpened themselves, their tools, their reset -- sources, they have the van. This isn't some rogue group from the middle ages, even though they behave in that way, the savage way. They have the weapon, they have the sophistication and God, do they where the wherewithal.BECKEL: The -- just to make a point, It is did start in the middle ages with the religions that they follow. I care about this guys is so brutal that they broke often. Now one of the reasons that the world is trying to focus on this is -- is because of these beheadings, because of the way they're -- the kind of outrageous behavior they have got is what galvanized in the world. I think that's probably the single biggest thing -- we saw that beheading, then the world start to come around. And I --and so the.GUILFOYLE: But that's who they are.BECKEL: Well, yeah. But listen, you're dealing -- I'm not going to defend Obama as a war president in every set of word. He is a reluctant president when it comes to this war.GUTFELD: He is reluctant.PERINO: I think every president is reluctant to go to war.BECKLE: Well, yeah, yup, maybe he's a little less but more reluctant.PERINO: More reluctant.WATTERS: When Jimmy Carter says you're too soft, you kind have a problem.BECKEL: Well, you know the set of commander runs the military -- our military in that part of the world, it start about Jimmy Carter.WATTERS: OK, great wartime President Jimmy Carter. Actually he was the only one.(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: We -- is actually it was Jimmy Carter who was the one who developed the missile in Europe that went a long way to getting the Russians to decide.WATTERS: So Jimmy Carter won the cold war. You heard it here first.BECKEL: No, is that would be ridiculous to say -- if it ridiculous to say Ronald Reagan did.WATTER: Then Ronald Reagan did not have any to do with that?BECKEL: He has something to do with it not much.WATTERS: Really? Because (inaudible) actually said that it was because Reagan.BECKEL: Yeah. The --GUILFOYLE: And to that guy.  BECKEL: I think there was combination of people who led to the fall of Soviet Union and it's not a political partisan issue, as you guys try to make it. Do not give that to Ronald Reagan a lot of people put a lot of blood on the floor.WATTER: You're right. You are absolutely right Bob.GUILFOYLE: And Ronald Reagan is the type or president who would never try and take the credit himself. Leader.GUTFELD: All right, but we leave here about the past. My own point is so secretary of defense should be secretary of defense not Rachel Carlson (ph) or ugona (ph)New developments on the Ebola threat, including some calls for the director of the CDC to resign, what major call actually. And later is politics behind the army's decision not to release the results of the completed Bowe Bergdahl investigation coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: So far the government is not considering a travel ban to deal what the Ebola crisis, making the case it could make the problem worse. But according to a new poll, the majority of Americans support the idea 67 percent says they back restricting entry the travelers from West African nations with Ebola epidemic. Charles Krauthammer said, ""It's going to happen.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Were going to have a travel ban, if this -- the patient who arrived off Liberia, are off the West Coast is indeed Ebola or even when the next patients happens. There is no reason why we should still be flying, Air France, British Air has canceled, these things are going to have the be done and they're going to be done soon.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Peter Johnson, Jr. however is cautious about changing the policy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER JOHNSON, JR., FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: What is the science behind not being for a travel ban, Dr. Frieden has the CDC written on that for Fox news. He said, ""It cannot stop spread, will only slow it."" He said, ""It's only going to drive patients with Ebola underground making difficult to address the outbreak."" Let's look at it in a dispassion, objective way, not to scandalize, not to stigmatize the West African countries, but to do what's best to protect them.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Someone who is not passionate last night on this topic of Dr. Frieden in particular, Bill O'Reilly.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. TOM FRIEDEN, CDC DIRECTOR: At this point, the team has identified 76 individuals who --BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Not being forthcoming about how the disease is being spread. Frieden should resign.What do we want puppet out there for a resign, have a little dignity Frieden, have a little dignity, you're misleading the American public.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So Bill O'Reilly so it said -- Jesse that I'm going to go with you first because Bill O'Reilly actually -- he called for Frieden to resign, I'm not sure if that's the right move, because we need like a head guy in charge, he has lost confidence.WATTERS: Obviously he's lost confidence. You know, Bill likes to call for people to resign almost immediately. I think it's probably.GUILFOYLE: And it is the working.WATTERS: I -- can imagine that. I think the probably that's going to happen is going to be a few more people to die from Ebola in the United States before this guy resigns. But the president won't fire him and you know why, because he doesn't want to be held accountable with would make a mistake. He let Shinseki (ph) hang out there for awhile and people were dying in the hospitals. Civilians over sold tobacco in the Obamacare Web site and she's around the secret service, director was there after the prostitution scandal. This guy's not going anywhere for right now, what struck me is was he said you know, ""We need to rethink our strategy."" Yeah, no, you need to rethink the strategy, that's what we pay you to do you're a public servant. He's not serving the public right now.PERINO: I did -- Bob that was interesting that -- that after being so black and white last week.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: Dr. Frieden saying, ""We've got this under control, we know what we're doing, no need to worry."" Then we have unfortunately, a nurse who is recovering hopefully, in the hospital. She said she was doing well, her name is Nina Pham, she was a caretaker, she says she followed the protocol, that's why Dr. Frieden says we're going to have to rethink things. How much do you think this hurts the whole -- the entire effort to try to contain the epidemic, I mean it's not a widespread situation here in the United States, are we over -- overblowing it?BECKEL: Yes, I think we are. And by the way, Bill O'Reilly being an expert on what should happen with the CDC is laughable. And also Dr. Manny he knows the doctor -- it doesn't -- I don't guess he's had many Ebola cases. I don't think Frieden -- I think Frieden is adjusting to the reality of the politics of it. I don't think this a guy who used to get in front of a press conference. And yes, he speaks in black and white, but now he's realizing this thing is sort of getting now to become so much of -- people are exaggerating it so much that he needs to deal with that. I don't know why he's got any evidence as to why he should be gone, I really don't and by the travel ban -- by the way, it was nice to see Charles Krauthammer getting on air, it's been so long. The --but I agree with him on this. I don't understand why it's got 65 people who been exposed is a 21 day period when you could get or not get Ebola. Why not put a ban on it so those days are over and then you probably won't have another case here.PERINO: Well, good question. And Greg let me then take it to the next level, which is President Obama today, in his press conference earlier today when he took questions. He said that, ""The world has a whole is not doing enough to contain the epidemic."" But the world is not going to do anything. The United States has to lead, right?GUITFELD: Pretty much -- pretty yes. I as always, that's the great thing is the evil -- we're the evil -- the great evil country, but we're the only people that can actually save lives.GUILFOYLE: We're the doers.GUTFELD: We're the doers. It's not about panic anymore, I think what -- O'Reilly was getting at was priorities. We feel as if the leader -- our leaders have taken their eye off the ball then perhaps, the training and the resources the money that was needed for that, had gone to other more politically favored ideas, like obesity and education on how evil smoking is, things like that that we need. How do you untangle politics from morality when politics is your morality, all of Obama's appointments and actions are political which explain the lock step.So this isn't really a White House, it's a sit in. And I think the reason why people are depressed and a bit worried is they can't trust anybody. And the reason why they can't trust anybody is because the media has enabled to flip it arrogance to block them in a way like a virus, their carelessness spread like a disease.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yeah, but you know the thing is, it used to be one person or somebody that was apolitical that you could trust, but the problem is nobody trusts anybody here. And by the way, I'm not an alarmist about this disease and I remain confident that this will be taken care of, the fact that the person who caught the disease was a health care worker and not just a roving citizen in Dallas. Because remember, Mr. Duncan was out in the street, getting sick and no stranger got sick. It was the person that was closes to him that got sick. So that's an encouraging -- actually believe or not, tragic but encouraging sign. But I think is the people cannot identify with this identity -- this White House.PERINO: Kimberly, let me get you in here, Peter Johnson Jr., one of the things he said this morning is that, the concern is that, ""if you did a travel ban, it could increase the distrust of government and make countries less likely to cooperate in stopping the spread."" I'm kind of persuaded by that.GUILFOYLE: Why is that though? I mean, I think it's in the abundance of caution, why not also employ containment. And until we can help them and they need help and we should step up and do it. And attack the disease right there at the epicenter. We can't wait for other people to do it, this guy over here, this guy over here, because it's not going to get done -- won't get done correctly. We do have the best minds of scientists and resources in the world at our disposal, so go there, attack it aggressively, but in the meantime, seal it off. Why would u even take the chance, especially when we were so certain that this wasn't going to be a contracted by this health care workers, they had on protective measures. I at least want to learn more, I want to have an open mind about it, yes, trust people that we have in charge, but come on, there is a lot of this and we're not 100 percent certain about. And it's a little disconcerting that the one guy that's saving the America from the bullet is Dr. Kent Brantly, every time he gives the transfusion.PERINO: The one who is -- he was.GUILFOYLE: That contracted it, receives the -- the serum and then now have the anti-bodies built up in his system.PERINO: That he travel to Nebraska and Texas.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: You have to match his blood type.GUTFELD: Why does the travel ban have to be all or nothing? I don't understand that.GUILFOYLE: It's not.GUTFELD: I mean, just let medical personnel.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Excuse me for the little tickle in my throat. Ahead on ""The Five,"" the government still says the reported shooting was an act of workplace violence. But then Nidal Hassan, own attorney said that it when Jihad. You're going to hear from him next.(COMMERCAIL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Well, he is self describe soldier of Allah. Nidal Hasan readily admitted to committing the massacre at Fort Hood in order to protect the Taliban. But government still labels the attack, an act of workplace violence rather than one over terror. Even his own lawyer, can't understand why.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNKNOWN): I don't know why they come up with the term workplace violence. The workplace violence is not the crime for which he was charged. Nidal Hassan was charged with mass murder.(UNKNOWN): Not terrorism.(UNKNOWN): No, and they could have elected to have proceed along that line but the government chose not to.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: He is also certain. This was an act of Jihad.(BEGIN VDIEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, THE KELLY FILE SHOW HOST: Is there any doubt in your mind that this is something who believes in the Jihad?(UNKNOWN): Will be practically say that correct, yes.KELLY: OK. And the judge shut that down. And the question I have for you is, why then to the day -- to this day does the government deny that this was Jihad, that it was terror?(UNKNOWN): I simply can't answer that.KELLY: Has he expressed any remorse to you ever?(UNKNOWN): I can't stay that it was remorse in the traditional sense. I think he feels that he didn't accomplish what he believed.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right, what does this tell you, Jesse, that the country, government, administration is afraid of words?WATTERS: Yes, they are. It is terrorism. That means that there was a domestic terror attack on the homeland under Obama's watch, and that means he'll suffer politically for that. So they call it workplace violence.You know how insane that is, workplace violence? You know how stupid he must think Americans are to buy that and how easily manipulated the American media is to not even question it? Has a reporter ever asked the president, ""Workplace violence? You got to be kidding me, right?"" Instead, they ask him things like, you know, ""How enchanting do you find the office?"" Do you remember that one? It's totally insane.It also, when you say workplace violence, it sanitizes the Muslim connection. So you don't want to blame it on Allah. You don't want to blame it on jihad. Because this guy's totally in bed with al Qaeda. We have evidence of that. He admits it. So right, exactly. So he doesn't want to offend Muslims, so he calls it workplace violence. It's absolutely insane.GUILFOYLE: No one's being fooled.WATTERS: No, no.GUILFOYLE: Even the defendant's attorney, Dana, or Greg.GUTFELD; Or me. That would be the equivalent of calling a beheading a migraine.And this fear of identifying evil is the culmination of four decades of emasculating political correctness. The idea that you cannot call a thing -- call something what it is for fear of offending somebody. This has festered on campuses, Bob, forever.BECKEL: Everywhere.GUTFELD: And now it infects the body politics of the greatest country ever.BECKEL: Every campus in America? I think you should shut the damn things down.GUTFELD: And it might be the only thing that could cause our downfall, because these tenured twerps have made it impossible for us to identify the very thing that wants us to be destroyed.GUILFOYLE: All right, Dana. Why this loose relationship with the rhetoric? Why can't they call it what it is?PERINO: I would like to -- I was just thinking, I would love to actually one day, hopefully, the person who made that final decision to call it workplace violence, I would love to get their side of the story.I think it's very interesting, Kimberly, and I have a question for you about this, is that so that's a heck of an interview that Megyn Kelly got with this lawyer. The trial hasn't even happened yet. How unusual is that for the lawyer to come on and basically say it was jihad, it wasn't workplace violence. And how does that affect the political?GUILFOYLE: He can't believe, doesn't have an explanation for why they called it workplace violence? I can't believe he gave the interview. I'm impressed. I'm glad he did, because we got some insight there that really further exposes the truth and the hypocrisy. I mean, he has his reasons why he thinks it's OK to go ahead and do that. But nevertheless, usually, you hold off until the case has been completely resolved and adjudicated before you go out and speak.BECKEL: It sounded to me like he...PERINO: He might have a personal agenda.GUILFOYLE: No, he didn't. Oh, how refreshing. Honesty.BECKEL: It seems like he was setting up for the guy who was a religious fanatic on this stuff, and that may save him from the death penalty. But the mass murder charges are -- it's harder. Obviously, somebody decided it's harder to convict this guy on terrorism laws than it is on mass murder, which would be a lot easier to do, and he will be convicted and he probably will be put to death. But I think you've got to be careful about criticizing. Maybe only criticize the use of words, but maybe not the particular law that they're charging him with.GUILFOYLE: I have another legal update, because those of you at home who have been following the Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl case, you know that, in fact, the investigation has been concluded, but we haven't been able to get the results.And of course, they have the majority of the information. Back in 2009 when he deserted and they conducted an investigation, that was a full, thorough investigation and talking to all the people that were involved and there were witnesses at the time. Now they've had the chance to speak to them, Greg, and in fact, still they're delaying this. What's going on?GUTFELD: It wouldn't be so weird, if it wasn't a practice of them always holding stuff back until post-election. They're like -- the White House is like a guy who waits until he's in the elevator to break wind. And it's just too late for anybody to do anything after that.BECKEL: Disgusting.GUTFELD: They always wait until the election is over. And then, boom, the stench is horrifying. Then that's when you hear about -- you hear about all the horrible things, whether it's Benghazi or whether it's the IRS.GUILFOYLE: Right. Because midterm elections are coming up.GUTFELD: It's an apt metaphor, Bob.WATTERS: It's a masterful P.R. move, and they've done this repeatedly. They say, ""We're going to have this internal investigation. We're not going to comment on this investigation until the investigation is finished.""It takes two seconds to prove this thing, OK? The guy was traded (ph). We know he's a deserter and that he endangered our men and women's lives in Afghanistan, because these guys are going to go back to the battlefield. And they're going to dump this thing on a Friday, when no one's paying attention. It's going to be totally whitewashed.GUILFOYLE: Right.WATTERS: And everybody knows it.GUILFOYLE: Well, because the results might show that he was a deserter or he went AWOL. And boy, is that really going to look bad, because not -- we didn't just get him back. We gave up a lot to do it. Terrorists.BECKEL: That may be the case. And probably, there's a lot of stuff in there that probably would be embarrassing. And when I call, I would do exactly the same thing.GUILFOYLE: Of course you would.PERINO: I would not.GUILFOYLE: Dana.PERINO: I would not, because I would have some honor and dignity and say, ""Let's just get it out there.""BECKEL: Oh, you got that one.PERINO: It is a shot. It is a shot. Because, you know, we're talking about people's lives. That's the president's majority in the Senate. How he thinks it would even help him or hurt him, I don't understand why he cares. They worry more about climate change than they do about this.The Department of Defense has said that Bowe Bergdahl investigation is done on their end. So where -- what could possibly be the holdup? Where is it?In addition to that, not only do the families deserve justice, but remember, he is -- he stands to get hundreds of thousands of dollars back pay...GUILFOYLE: Money.PERINO: ... if it's found that he wasn't a deserter. If it wasn't a dessert, can we just find that out? But why are we holding it back?BECKEL: You suggested Republicans have not held things back or held things up.PERINO: You said -- you said, ""If it were me, I would do it.""I said if I were me I would not.GUILFOYLE; But it doesn't change the fact of the matter. Democrat, Republican, whatever, be about the truth, be about transparency. The American people are paying and footing the bill, so give us the information immediately.Next Hillary Clinton got big bucks to give a speech last night for a university in Nevada, and wait until you hear what the speech was about.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: When it comes to playing politics, no one quite does it as well as the Clintons. Last night at a fundraiser for UNLV, Hillary spoke passionately about her higher education costs.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Higher education shouldn't be a privilege for those able to afford it. It should be an opportunity widely available for anyone with the talent, determination and ambition to learn.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: What she failed to mention was her speaking fee for the event was a cool $225,000. While the money will supposedly go to the Clinton Global Initiative, it still ignites a debate over what some see as hypocrisy in the Democrat politics, hypocrisy which Jon Stewart points out, extends to the party's fundraising prowess.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JON STEWART, HOST, COMEDY CENTRAL'S ""THE DAILY SHOW"": Recently the Democrats' reticence for fundraising was truly on display.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Obama headed to his 53rd fund-raiser of the year at Gwyneth Paltrow's house.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tonight the president will attend the fundraiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, or the DSCC, at the home of real-estate mogul Rich Richmond.STEWART: What?You know, it might not be the best way to send a message about their contempt for money in politics with back to back fund-raisers from the homes of Lady Goop and literally, a man named Richie Rich.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So let's be honest here. Hillary was dead broke just a few years ago. She really needed the money. She's a grandmother now, you know? She's got to pay the bills. College tuition is going to be very expensive when her grandchild turns 18. Bob, what do you think about all this?BECKEL: You know, I was -- you'll be shocked to know that I actually read my research for the show this morning. You know what I read? What I read was our staff put together a lot of newspaper headlines and right-wing blogs saying Hillary takes this $225,000 away from University of Nevada, Las Vegas.The fact is -- the fact is not a single dime from that university went to her. It was through the foundation by two of the biggest contributors to the Clintons. They paid for it. They had nothing to do with UNLV. But, of course, the conservatives in the right wing are spreading around, oh, she took all this money from the university, because -- and now look, these poor kids can't have the money. It's ridiculous and typical right-wing crap.WATTERS: SO She's not going to use any of that money?BECKEL: No. I think she's going to give it to the global initiative. Don't -- and I would not down the global initiative. It does some pretty good things.WATTERS: OK. Kimberly...GUILFOYLE: Yes, but they're taking it. It's still their umbrella foundation.BECKEL: Exactly. So what.GUILFOYLE: If you're that concerned about the high price of education in America, why not make significant moves by making a donation to show that you, in fact, are concerned about it?BECKEL: I would tell you this, because I try to be nice to you. They do more in a week for helping people then, frankly, a lot of us do.GUILFOYLE: I didn't say that. I wasn't making that kind of judgment about whether or not they do other things. I'm saying in this specific instance, this was an example for them to show leadership and make a contribution.WATTERS: Let me ask you this, Greg. Isn't it a cheap shot for Republicans to complain that Hillary is banking all this dough? I mean, it's a free market.GUTFELD: Right.WATTERS: She's getting what she's worth out there. You know, maybe she's going to squirrel it away for a rainy day?GUTFELD: I agree, because -- but as a Republican conservative libertarian, you have no qualm about anybody getting rich. You want everybody to be rich.Which makes you difference from Hillary because she fronts a mob that's -- of the aggrieved and envious who believe tethering achievers is a way to create a false sense of equality, amongst others.She's so rich now she can wear a pants suit made of Faberge eggs. Which means that she's basically a poster child for political profiteering.You know, they say they want to -- they want to get into politics to help. But it's always, at the end of the tenure, to help themselves, to get a paltry salary, but then, when they get out of office, it's eight, it's ten, it's nine -- you know, nine figures.BECKEL: It's all Democrats and Republicans, I might add, cash in.GUTFELD: Yes, but politics -- politics is Power Ball lotto for liberals.BECKEL: And not conservatives? The conservatives take no money when they get out.GUTFELD: You know what? But they don't lie about it.BECKEL: Yes, they do all the time. Come on.GUTFELD: We don't think it's bad. We want you to be rich.BECKEL: Listen, you guys accept the fact that politics...GUTFELD: You guys don't -- you guys don't want anybody to be rich but you. You just want the liberals to be rich.BECKEL: No, no, no, that's wrong. Greg, I hope you get rich, I really do.GUTFELD: I hope I get as rich as Rich Richmond.BECKEL: And then I think the idea of this hypocrisy, jump on them about making more.WATTERS: Let me ask you about what Jon Stewart said, because he does have a point. I mean, I'm sure you donate, right? You get these e-mails. You have e-mail, Bob?BECKEL: No.GUILFOYLE: He doesn't really check it.WATTERS: OK. So you know, you're getting flooded -- it's like cyber bullying. They're flooding your inbox, harassing you to do it.BECKEL: Under my contract, I can't give political money, so -- but I used to give it. Yes, they do. And the Democrats got very good at raising money and they raised it from the very people that they demonize. I understand what you're talking about, but at this stage of the game, in this campaign season, the only hope is to get as much money in these races as possible.GUILFOYLE: And out and out spending.WATTERS: And Republicans are getting crazed, Dana. What's going on here?PERINO: Well, the stakes are high. And the Democrats realize that. And they've been able to raise a ton on the PACs. The thing I liked about John Stewart's point is the hypocrisy of demanding funding reform, or campaign finance reform, all at the same time beating Republicans in that game, and that does take a little bit of chutzpah.GUILFOYLE: And they're beating them in some races, outspending 10-1 and 5- 1.BECKEL: My career, they were outspending, the Republicans, 20-1.WATTERS: Well, it just shows how desperate the Democrats have become.All right. Coming up, we have all done it, made excuses to get out of something we're invited to. What are ""The Five's"" favorite escape lines? You'll hear them next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BECKEL: Have you ever failed to come up with a good so you don't have to hang out with someone? If not -- we'll say if so, Zach Galifianakis and Jimmy Fallon have some pointers.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JIMMY FALLON, HOST, NBC'S ""THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JIMMY FALLON"": We should hang out soon.ZACH GALIFIANAKIS, COMEDIAN/ACTOR: I'd like that, yes. How's Tuesday then?FALLON: Catching up on ""Law and Order.""GALIFIANAKIS: Which season?FALLON: All of them. Never seen the show.GALIFIANAKIS: Oh, you're going to have a blast.FALLON: How about Wednesday at 4 a.m.?GALIFIANAKIS: I can't on Wednesday. I'm braiding my landlord's hair. How about Thursday?FALLON: I have to ride and elephant Thursday.GALIFIANAKIS: November this year is a wash, because I've got to clone a bunch of dinosaurs and open a theme park, and then something terrible goes wrong and then you learn your lesson of being God. So November's no good.How's December?FALLON: December I can't. I'm literally Santa Claus.GALIFIANAKIS: That's you?Why don't we just, like, maybe pencil something in for January 1, 2030?FALLON: Sounds great.GALIFIANAKIS: OK, have a good one.FALLON: Bye.(END VIDEOTAPE)BECKEL: All right. Greg, you're probably the most social person here at this table. What do you use to get out of invitations?GUTFELD: I don't get out of them. If somebody invites me to a party, I say yes, and I go. I show up late, drunk as hell. I never leave. I throw up in their sink. I hit on the wife. I hit on the husband. I hit on the grandparents. I break a vase. Then, because I say yes, I'm never invited to anything again. And it spreads like a virus. Everybody knows never to invite me anywhere. So I never get asked to anything.BECKEL: That's Greg.Now Dana, you made the decision...GUILFOYLE: She doesn't do that.BECKEL: You made a decision not to accept, if I remember, baby showers or something?PERINO: Yes, I don't do baby showers. This is a personal policy of mine, so that if a baby shower invitation comes, I just say, ""Thank you very much. I'll send a gift, but I can't attend.""GUTFELD: You got hit by a baby once.PERINO: More than once. I can't attend.BECKEL: You just say, ""I can't attend.""PERINO: I don't attend. Well, I won't attend -- it's a personal policy. Like Stewart Varney, of FOX News, FOX Business, he says he does not socialize. I love that. So he has a personal policy. He never has this problem.I originally told somebody I'm not coming to their party, because I don't like -- I don't like parties.GUTFELD: You know what's the worst thing about a baby shower? The baby puddle.BECKEL: You get -- you get asked out by a lot of SEALs.GUILFOYLE: You know what?BECKEL: Navy SEALs, what's your excuse when you say no?GUILFOYLE: Obviously not. I'm just a nice person, and I say yes. And I get asked to do a lot of nice things.BECKEL: You say yes to everyone.GUILFOYLE: You know, charity events, et cetera, and then I feel horrible if I don't go or make the time. So I go out of my way. That's why I don't take any time off, just staying here and working and hanging out.BECKEL: And you go with (UNINTELLIGIBLE).GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.BECKEL: Jesse, what's your excuse?GUILFOYLE: I'm peeling my skin off.BECKEL: What's your best excuse?WATTERS: It's great working in the news business, because you can say, ""I can't. Putin just invaded another country. We're going live tonight."" And half the time that's true.PERINO: Even if you're not on.BECKEL: In my case, I don't get invited to anything so it's not a problem.""One More Thing"" is up next.PERINO: Not true. You asked Jesse out.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: ""One More Thing,"" Dana.PERINO: So yesterday, you know I was going through this 24-36-hour cold, flu thing. It was really bad last night, and I was really -- it was a pitiful thing. I asked all of you for some help with some home remedies. I just want to scroll through a few and mention weird stuff, some good stuff. GUTFELD: Why'd you do that?PERINO: ""My mom cut onions in my socks in bed. Bit (ph) my fever, and I felt better. Go on a treadmill with -- sipping vodka. Lots of tequila and bourbon, cloves, oregano, rosemary, garlic, lemon, more bourbon, tequila.GUILFOYLE: Love tequila.PERINO: It just goes on and on. There were so many great suggestions, I took too many at once. Like the oregano spray and the elderberry syrup and the Aleve and the Zicam and the...BECKEL: All the booze.PERINO: ... vitamin C were too much. But I'm doing better.GUILFOYLE: I think the...GUTFELD: That's just the booze talking. Jesse.WATTERS: OK. Well, I've been looking far and wide for this video. Apparently, there's some really salacious Greg Gutfeld video that's been floating around the Internet. I got my hands on it. Here it is.GUTFELD: That is me. I...WATTERS: That's actually not Greg.GUTFELD: That was last week.WATTERS: Last week. That's actually Charlie from Tennessee, rocking and rolling in the comfort of his own home.GUILFOYLE: He's amazing.GUTFELD: He's going to be on ""Dancing with the Stars"" one of these days.PERINO: Yes, he's good.GUILFOYLE: No, he's really good.BECKEL: Here goes my ""one More thing."" Those of you out there who think that Kimberly should accept my invitation today, please let us know. Thank you. We'll vote and we'll tally it up by Friday.All right, now...GUILFOYLE: Please don't vote for that!BECKEL: This is actually an important day. Fifty years ago today, one of the greatest human beings in the world, my hero, Martin Luther King, was nominated and was endorsed and got the Nobel Peace Prize, and he deserved it very much. And I still miss him. Who's next?GUTFELD: I am. You know, a lot of times I'll be hanging out in my penthouse apartment, usually in the hot tub, and people will say, hey, what does Bob Beckel do after work? And I'll say, ""You know what? He loves to relax and just hang out."" Here's some film with him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(PUPPY BARKING)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.Oh, he's doing a howl.GUTFELD: That is you.BECKEL: Yes. Outside of apartment buildings. You used to -- you used to be able to -- you ever go through the foot, the big stage where you drive up to the apartment building, you flick your Bic and you get one back. You got hooked up.GUTFELD: I have no idea, Bob.PERINO: That's what they call Tinder now.GUTFELD: K.G.GUILFOYLE: Dana, I don't like when you...PERINO: I don't really know what Tinder is. I've heard you guys talk about it.GUTFELD: It's just wholesome.GUILFOYLE: All right, in the happiness zone of proposals, those of you who like to get them. Uh-huh. An Air Force captain completed his successful mission in front of thousands of cheering NFL fans. On Sunday, he proposed to his girlfriend, who is a cheerleader, Claire Thornton -- she's 24 years old -- in front of the crowd, and the good news is she accepted.PERINO: How can you say no?GUILFOYLE: Look at how charming that is. It's so cute. He got down on one knee.PERINO: That is cute.GUTFELD: My theory is, if you ever have a divorce, you also have to do that in public.GUILFOYLE: Can we also have a shout-out for ""FOX & Friends"" in the morning.GUTFELD: Yes, you can. We'll edit it out, though. No one will know.That's it for us. ""Special Report"" is up next.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST (voice-over):  Tonight...DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You know the theme.  Look at all those red caps (ph).  Make America great again.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY:  The countdown to New Hampshire is on, and new poll numbers have been released.  Our panel will break it all down.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I am 100 percent confident.HANNITY:  Then a delusional Hillary Clinton claims the FBI will find that she did nothing wrong with her private e-mail server.Plus, things got downright nasty at the Democratic debate.CLINTON:  Let's talk about the issues.  Let's talk about the issues that divide us.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, D-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Let's talk about issues!CLINTON:  Let's -- we both agree...HANNITY:  Plus, in a ""Hannity"" exclusive, the candidates make their final pitches before the New Hampshire primary.  That's right, their final closing statement. ""Hannity"" starts right here, right now.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY:  And welcome to ""Hannity.""  Tonight, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and many other 2016 candidates -- they're going to make the final pitches to you, the voters, before the New Hampshire primary.  We sent cameras to all their locations.  You're going to hear that only here on ""Hannity.""But first, New Hampshire -- the primary is just four days away, and tonight, we have brand-new poll numbers out of the Granite State.  An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll shows that Trump is out in front, 30 percent of the vote.  Rubio comes in second in this poll at 17, Ted Cruz in third with 15 percent.  And then you have John Kasich with 10 and Jeb Bush with 9.You have a U. Mass Lowell 7 (ph) News poll out today finds Trump with a strong lead at 34 percent, Rubio in second with 15 percent, Ted Cruz a close third with 14 percent.  Coming up next, Kasich and Bush, and according to a new ARG poll, Trump has a sizable lead with 36 percent, Rubio in second with 15,  Kasich 14 percent and next are Cruz and Bush and Chris Christie.Here with reaction, from The Washington Times, Charles Hurt, the co-host of ""The Five,"" Kimberly ""K.G."" Guilfoyle.  How are you?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST:  Very good.(INAUDIBLE)HANNITY:  Well, we call you K.H. here, so (INAUDIBLE)GUILFOYLE:  Yes.HANNITY:  You looks at these numbers, it seems pretty overwhelming.  Trump continues to dominate.  These are post-Iowa caucus polls.  Looks like the Granite State is holding strong for Trump.GUILFOYLE:  Absolutely.  It's Trump's to lose.  I mean, keep the momentum going.  I don't think there's any chance that he is going to not deliver fully in New Hampshire, especially after, you know, Iowa.  He did very well there.  He got a tremendous amount of votes.  But I know -- I'm sure he would have wanted to beat, you know, Ted Cruz.Now's your chance.  Beat them all.  Beat convincingly.  He says he wants to win.  He wants to be president.  He wants the nomination.  That's how you do it.  And then take it down, boom, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida, and move on to the rest.HANNITY:  And Charles, it seems to be a strategic shift by Donald Trump inasmuch as he's doing more retail politics.  He's added a lot more New Hampshire events.  They seem to be building a ground game which was apparently really missing in Iowa, so a big difference in their approach to New Hampshire, and it's a primary, not a caucus.CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Yes.  And I think he's being a little bit more careful in New Hampshire.  I think what we're seeing is more of that -- the sort of lower-key demeanor, like we saw with his concession speech out in Iowa, where he congratulated Ted Cruz.But I think -- and I think Kimberly's exactly right, and I think that -- you know, that -- this is a must win state for him.  The other thing that I think is kind of interesting from those polls is despite, you know, Cruz's victory and -- Ted Cruz's victory in Iowa, it does not seem to have done a whole lot to help him in New Hampshire.New Hampshire was already a pretty uphill battle for him, obviously, but -- but obviously, you know, these polls indicate that it's not going to look -- you know, he's not going to -- it does not look like he's going to make some sort of surprise upset here.HANNITY:  And...HURT:  (INAUDIBLE) and really complicate things for Donald.HANNITY:  Yes.  And you know, Kimberly, while this Carson-Trump-Cruz battle went on this week, he's seemed to have now left that behind and now is -- he seems more focused on issues.GUILFOYLE:  Right.  Hit it and quit it.  Move on and get focused on getting the votes.  Don't sleep at night, if you don't have to.  Shake every hand in New Hampshire that you can.  For sure, it's retail politics.  And spend the bucks.  Spend the bucks for an effective ground game because we saw the proof's in the pudding.Rubio, Cruz did that.  It worked for them in Iowa.  But don't forget we've got a lot -- a lot of other players trying to do very well.  It's do or die time in New Hampshire with Kasich, with Christie, with Jeb Bush, and they're all putting it on the line.  So let's see it.HANNITY:  How will...GUILFOYLE:  And Rubio's hungry.  He's getting after it.HANNITY:  How well...GUILFOYLE:  He looks like he grew three inches.HANNITY:  Well, OK.  So as far as Kasich and Christie and Jeb, how well do they have to do for them to continue?GUILFOYLE:  Well, I think they all know they've got to place very well.  Everybody wants that, like, coveted at least, you know, third place spot to be able to continue on and go forward and have momentum.  Kasich's on record saying if, Listen, if I don't do well, if I get blown away in New Hampshire, you know, it's over for me.But he's got some tremendous endorsements.  Chris Christie's done more town halls, you know, than anybody and spent the most days in New Hampshire.  So this was really his game plan to begin with, was to hit the town halls hard, and he's done that.  So let's see if it's able to resonate into some, you know, serious numbers for him.  And also do not, do not count Jeb Bush out.HANNITY:  Really?GUILFOYLE:  Yes.HANNITY:  You think -- why do you say that?GUILFOYLE:  Because he's really invested a lot of money and time there, as well.  And I think he knows that he needs to do well there.  We've seen kind of the Bush big guns come out.  I mean, I'm a huge fan of Barbara Bush.HANNITY:  Mom and W.GUILFOYLE:  Absolutely.  And W.  So we have 43 out there campaigning for him, and his mother.  They did a fantastic job on the morning shows today.  And you know, this is very likable.  He's done well traditionally there in New Hampshire.  So I think that's a huge asset and advantage for him.HANNITY:  Charlie...GUILFOYLE:  And also going forward for South Carolina.HANNITY:  Charlie, if it's one, two, three, Trump, Rubio, Cruz, Trump, Cruz, Rubio, Cruz -- whatever it happens to be, does that pretty much make this going forward a three-person race, even though we're only talking about 3 percent of the delegates?HURT:  I think that I would go one step further than what Kimberly just said and say it is absolutely make or break in New Hampshire for Jeb Bush or Kasich or for Christie.  They have to do well here because going -- you know, leaving out of here and going into these other states, they're going to be very hostile to the -- to the -- campaigns that these guys are running.And I also agree with what Kimberly said about Jeb Bush because if there's a time for him to break out, it is -- it's going to be now.  And I think...HANNITY:  But the polls show the guy that seems to be breaking out the most is Kasich.HURT:  Yes.HANNITY:  Kasich seems to have the best -- at least from the poll numbers.  And by the way, historically, I was warning this audience that Iowa polls are unreliable and they can be off by a lot.  I turned out to be right.HURT:  And it's a caucus.HANNITY:  New Hampshire polls are a little more reliable.HURT:  Yes.  And -- and -- but the thing about Jeb Bush is this, that he has run his entire campaign running away from his family's name.  He doesn't even have his family's name in his -- you know, it's just Jeb.  And so -- so he smartly realizes that it's now -- it's make or break now.  He has no choice.  So he has taken his entire campaign and completely turned it inside out, and is doing the exact opposite of everything he's done.And we know how bad the first part was.  So this might -- you know, I don't know.  Maybe this makes it worse?  Maybe it saves him.  I don't know.  But it's probably smart to do the opposite of everything he's been doing so far.HANNITY:  K.G., look at...GUILFOYLE:  Put it on the line now.  It's really exciting.  I think New Hampshire is really going to be the big tell.  You're going to see a few other people I think drop out after these results come in, and we're going to get down to the business of really selecting the best candidate to be the nominee.HANNITY:  MUR/CNN, Sanders plus 31,  NBC/Wall Street Journal, Sanders plus 20, U. Mass 7 News Sanders plus 22, ARG, Sanders plus 16.  Wow! And now nationally, with a poll that came out 44-42...GUILFOYLE:  Well, what does that tell you?  That's within the statistical margin of error.  If I'm, like, Hillary Clinton, you can't be even hiding under the covers at this point.  Silent screaming inside?  You better start praying, lighting candles, do something because you need help.HANNITY:  All right, so does South Carolina then become her firewall?GUILFOYLE:  (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY:  Right?GUILFOYLE:  There you go.  You have to.  Can you imagine, especially with this close as the results were in Iowa?  My gosh, that was terrible for her.  And now New Hampshire -- I mean, listen, unless something's completely crazy, she's going to take a beating there.HANNITY:  You know, and I'm not convinced, from my standpoint, Charles -- I give Bernie Sanders Iowa for a lot of different reasons.HURT:  Oh, sure.HANNITY:  Six coin tosses...GUILFOYLE:  Crazy!HANNITY:  ... the Des Moines Register saying what happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle.GUILFOYLE:  Sure.HANNITY:  They talked about -- you know, they found so many inconsistencies.  They can't return -- they can't even give all the votes over at this point.  It seems like something corrupt is going on.  It doesn't smell good.HURT:  Yes.  And at the very, very least, even if Bernie Sanders in the end doesn't win this race, he can -- in the primary -- he can point to the fact that he has totally defined the conversation and he has forced Hillary to run so far to the left that once she gets out of this, if she gets out of this, and assuming she's not arrested...(LAUGHTER)HURT:  If she into a general election...HANNITY:  Assume?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  She's assuming a lot, though, that she's not arrested.HURT:  I know.  I know.  But she did win six of six coin tosses, so that's -- you know, so...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Yes, I want the coin.GUILFOYLE:  Yes, she...HANNITY:  Heads I win, tails you lose.  All right...GUILFOYLE:  They should put her in for the Super Bowl Sunday for the coin toss!  Oh, yes!  It's me again!  I win!(LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  Hillary wins.  Exactly.GUILFOYLE:  The coin can't help her, though, in New Hampshire, though, that's for sure.HANNITY:  Put your legal hat on for on second...GUILFOLYE:  I'll do it.HANNITY:  ... because you're a former prosecutor.GUILFOLYE:  Yes.HANNITY:  And we've looked at the law.  We've identified, through Rudy Giuliani, former prosecutor also...GUILFOLYE:  Yeah.HANNITY:  ... 16 potential felonies that she may have committed.GUILFOYLE:  Absolutely.HANNITY:  And every single e-mail that's either top secret or special access program, SAP, classified, which higher than top secret, would represent an individual felony count.GUILFOYLE:  Correct.HANNITY:  Now, if there's criminal referral by the FBI, which it seems is going to come...GUILFOYLE:  How could it not?HANNITY:  How could it not?GUILFOYLE:  How could it not?HANNITY:  Because it...GUILFOYLE:  But then goes to DOJ.  And you think -- what do you think, you know, Mr. Lynch is going to do about it?  This is the problem.  So you're going to see -- and it's going to -- it's not supposed to, but it would very likely, right, get leaked.  We're going to hear about it.HANNITY:  Oh, it'll get leaked.GUILFOYLE:  If they make a recommendation for an indictment and they do not pick that up, what an outrage.  And she will still be so damaged from that!HANNITY:  Can you imagine Comey -- everything I hear about Comey...GUILFOYLE:  Yes.HANNITY:  I don't know him -- straight shooter.  He was willing to resign...GUILFOYLE:  Yes.HANNITY:  ... over the John Ashcroft Gonzales issue.GUILFOYLE:  And perhaps he will over this.HANNITY:  Could you imagine if he resigned?GUILFOYLE:  All the U.S. attorneys that I know say he's been a very qualified, straight shooter, credible, a man with a lot of integrity.  So he's got to do the right thing where justice is concerned, and hopefully, it will prevail.HANNITY:  Maybe you should be the attorney general because if it's a Republican administration, you could indict Hillary.GUILFOYLE:  There you go.HANNITY:  There you go.  That works.  All right.GUILFOYLE:  Yes, yes.  Put me in, Coach!(LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  All right, thank you.And coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FMR. SEC. OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I am 100 percent confident.  This is a security review that was requested.  It is being carried out.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, Hillary goes off the rails saying, well, she's got nothing to worry about with the FBI looking into the private server scandal.  Really? And then later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  I know we can combat climate change and be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Hillary Clinton's Howard Dean moment.  Tucker Carlson, Leslie Marshall will be here to debate who won the week.  Here's a hint.  It was not Hillary!Ant then later, a ""Hannity"" exclusive tonight.  All the 2016 candidates heading into New Hampshire make their final pitch.  We sent our cameras to all of them, 60 to 90 seconds, their final pitch, why they should win New Hampshire.  That's only something you'll see here on ""Hannity"" straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  I never sent or received any classified material.  They are retroactively classifying it.  I agree completely with Secretary Powell who said that this is an absurdity.  And so I think the American people will know it's an absurdity.  I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material.  Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?CLINTON:  I am 100 percent confident.  This is a security review that was requested.  It is being carried out.  It will be resolved.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, Hillary Clinton at last night's Democratic debate saying she's confident the FBI investigation into her private server will result in nothing.But that wasn't the only tense moment between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.  Take a look at just some of the fireworks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  You being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I don't know anyone else who fits that definition.SANDERS:  I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, let's talk about the...CLINTON:  Well, you -- you began it yesterday...SANDERS:  Let's talk about...CLINTON:  ... with your comments.SANDERS:  ... what we should do.CLINTON:  Honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment.I think it's time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign...SANDERS:  Oh!CLINTON:  ... have been carrying out in recent weeks, and let's talk...(BOOS)CLINTON:  Let's talk about the issues.  Let's talk about the issues that divide us and let's...SANDERS:  Let us talk about issues.CLINTON:  We both agree with campaign finance reform.SANDERS:  Let's talk about issues.CLINTON:  I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.SANDERS:  Let's...CLINTON:  I want to reverse Citizens United.SANDERS:  Let's -- let's talk about issues.CLINTON:  And so let's talk about issues.SANDERS:  Let's talk about issues.  All right, let's talk about why in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated.  Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided -- spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?  Well, some people might think, yes, that had some influence.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, joining us now is former Obama surrogate, political consultant Matthew Littman is with us.  Former NYPD detective, Fox News contributor Bo Dietl and former Clinton pollster, Fox News contributor Doug Schoen.All right, the inspector general for the intelligence department, a guy appointed by Obama, a guy confirmed by a Democratic majority in the Senate-- he's the one that says that they found dozens and dozens of...DOUG SCHOEN, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.HANNITY:  ... e-mails with SAP, special access program, classification. OK, that's not retroactive.  What she said is an outright lie!  It's just not true!SCHOEN:  Sean, this is a real political and legal problem for her.HANNITY:  It's a legal problem.  This is the FBI, Democratic inspector general!SCHOEN:  Well, it's political and legal because it has legal implications and political implications for her candidacy.  But I regard it, as a Clinton supporter, as something that is very serious.  We still don't know what the Justice Department will do.  But I'm not 100 percent certain it will be resolved to her satisfaction.BO DIETL, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  You know, there's two areas here.  One area is if she intentionally did it.  The other area is negligence.HANNITY:  But the law doesn't matter.DIETL:  No, but the negligence side, even if she was negligent with it, it's still a crime.  And there's a lot of things on here I think with a lot of these political contributions and on these e-mails -- there's a lot of good stuff there.  When her husband, the president -- I think it was over $110 million worth of speeches, UBS -- all of a sudden, they did a deal with UBS.  He got $1.5 million for doing a speech for 15 minutes!This thing stinks!  All she's about is one thing, money!  That Clinton Foundation, coming through Canada -- every one of these contributions are coming from countries that are not really favorable to the United States!HANNITY:  Let's go to Mr. Littman.  Now, look, you were up against the Clinton machine.  Things got really personal, Bill Clinton accusing the Obama campaign, They played the race card on me and they planned to do it from the very beginning.  So there's been bad blood with Clinton and Obama.Now you've Clinton going after poor Bernie Sanders with the ""artful smear"" comment.  It almost seems like we're back in 2008.  The front-runner is losing to an insurgent candidate!  In this case, it's a 74-year-old curmudgeon socialist from Vermont!(LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  It doesn't get any worse, Mr. Littman, than that!MATTHEW LITTMAN, POLITICAL CONSULTANT:  From Brooklyn.  Yes, no, well -- well, look, I think in the Democratic Party, the one thing that's been shown over time is liberals really like an underdog, and in Bernie Sanders's case, he's promising a lot of people free health care, basically free college...HANNITY:  Free, free.LITTMAN:  ... basically, you can eat pizza for lunch every day and not get fat and...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Wait a minute!  But you heard Hillary's Iowa speech...LITTMAN:  ... the Bernie Sanders campaign.HANNITY:  After she lost Iowa, she offered everything free like Bernie!  She sounded like Bernie on steroids!(LAUGHTER)LITTMAN:  No.HANNITY:  Yes!LITTMAN:  I don't agree with that because you...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  She makes a list of every single leftist thing that she can offer for free!  Let's roll that tape.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  We can create more good-paying jobs and raise incomes for hard- working Americans again.  I know that we can finish the job of universal health care coverage for every single man, woman and child!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  I know we can combat climate change and be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  I know we can make college affordable and get student debt off the backs of young people!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  The only thing -- the only thing missing was the Dean scream, angry and...LITTMAN:  Wait.  Excuse me.  Whoa!HANNITY:  ... more left-wing than Bernie!  That's not her!LITTMAN:  Sean, you said everything was free.  She said nothing in there that was free.HANNITY:  OK.LITTMAN:  More clean energy jobs...HANNITY:  You didn't hear the same thing I did.LITTMAN:  ... less student debt?  That's not free.HANNITY:  Bo?DIETL:  You know what I'm starting to see?  I'm starting to see the real Hillary Clinton.  Some of my Secret Service friends tell me about little episodes that happened in the White House with President Bill there, and this is the lady that you're starting the see right now!HANNITY:  See, that's what I love about Bo.  Bo has the connections to get the real story.DIETL:  Well, $15 million from Wall Street.  Now she hates Wall Street.  She will say and she will do anything to get that nomination!HANNITY:  I agree with you.DIETL:  She's a liar, and that's the facts!HANNITY:  And by the way, and the American people...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  The people see her.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't you feel that, Sean?HANNITY:  I do.  And she will lose.  I think she is an unelectable candidate for your side.  Let me give you an example.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So that also means you don't think the Justice Department will do anything, as I don't.HANNITY:  I actually think -- well, here's what I think is how it will go down.  I think there'll be a criminal referral.  I think that the Justice Department will resist.  I think Comey will resign.  Other FBI people will resign.  They will leak the entire, you know, list of evidence.  And she is unelectable.  That's what I think.Now, let's go to the issue of her duplicity.  Answering the question, $675,000 for three speeches to Goldman Sachs -- let's play the answer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One of the things that Senator Sanders points to, and a lot of your critics point to, is you made three speeches for Goldman Sachs.  You were paid $675,000 for three speeches.  Was that a mistake?  I mean, was that a bad error in judgment?CLINTON:  Look, I made speeches to lots of groups.  I told them what I thought.  I answered questions.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But did you have to be paid $675,000?CLINTON:  Well, I don't know.  That's what they offered.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON:  So -- you know, every secretary of state that I know has done that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But that's (INAUDIBLE) office and not running for an office again.CLINTON:  Well, I didn't know...UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You must have known.CLINTON:  To be honest, I wasn't -- I wasn't committed to running.  I didn't -- I didn't know whether I was...UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You didn't think you were going to run for president again?CLINTON:  I didn't.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  It's just like the Clinton Foundation.  She won't criticize Saudi Arabia.  They give money to the Clinton Foundation and they buy her silence on the abuse of women and human rights record.  It's the same thing!SCHOEN:  Well, You see, I think, unless we're close to the Saudis, Sean, to combat Iran, we've got a real problem.  But what she's not doing...HANNITY:  She took money from the Saudis and she won't criticize that women have to dress a certain way, can't drive a car, can't leave the house without a male relative...(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN:  ... to say that if we don't work with them...HANNITY:  That's not the same as taking their money and not speaking out about their human rights failures!UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) give them a lot of money for their defense, which we...HANNITY:  No.  Hillary gained money for the foundation!  You're missing the point!SCHOEN:  I understand.  She's using it to help women.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  All right, let me -- let me make sure.  We'll get back to Bo in a second.  Matt, I want to -- I don't want to leave you out here.  And she's...LITTMAN:  Thank you.HANNITY:  She is hugging Barack Obama like she's trying to wrap herself around -- you know why?  Because I think she wants Barack Obama to use his influence with Loretta Lynch and not push for an indictment, which every other American would get!LITTMAN:  Sean, I'm shocked that you feel that way.  I don't agree with you.  I'm sure that surprises you, too.HANNITY:  I'm stunned.LITTMAN:  On the issue -- if you want me to talk about the issue of the speaking fees and Wall Street?  Because I'm a speech writer, and I've been writing speeches for a lot of people who speak to a lot of corporations.  That's a whole big business...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  $225,000??(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  And how many get $225,000 a speech?LITTMAN:  That's right.  By the way, can I tell you...LITTMAN:  I could actually tell you.HANNITY:  How many?LITTMAN:  I can actually tell you who gets those fees.HANNITY:  Who?LITTMAN:  There are a lot of -- you'd be surprised.HANNITY:  How many get 225,000 grand?(CROSSTALK)LITTMAN:  ... Sean Penn or George Clooney or Kevin Spacey.HANNITY:  I got to up my fee...(CROSSTALK)LITTMAN:  You do have to up your fee!HANNITY:  What?LITTMAN:  But it's true.  And they get -- they get -- it is true.  And they get paid to speak about their experiences...HANNITY:  But the point is the obvious...LITTMAN:  ... and leadership...HANNITY:  ... conflict of interest!  People buy her influence.  And this was what the whole Clinton Foundation issue is about.(CROSSTALK)LITTMAN:  ... not buying the influence.HANNITY:  Yes, they are!DIETL:  Absolutely, they are.  With UBS...LITTMAN:  No, they're no.  They're just giving speeches!DIETL:  Hold on a second!  OK, how do you explain...(CROSSTALK)DIETL:  ... Clinton $1.5 million from UBS, and all of a sudden, they give them a fine.  That was with the bank accounts that were being hidden over there, all these things set up and money then floats into the Clinton Foundation!You've got criminal people involved there!  And then you got that guy -- who was that guy that the -- he was a billionaire.  He stole -- he was selling arms, and then all of a sudden, he pardoned...HANNITY:  Marc Rich.  Marc Rich.DIETL:  It was all part of that!  The Clintons' roost...HANNITY:  Bo...DIETL:  ... will come home to roost.HANNITY:  The chickens will come home to roost.(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN:  She will be the nominee, and given the dysfunction on the Republican side, she has got as much chance to be elected as anybody.HANNITY:  Wow.  All right, guys.  Thank you all for being with us.LITTMAN:  I agree with Doug.DIETL:  I agree with Mr. Obama (ph).LITTMAN:  Thank you.DIETL:  I agree with that.HANNITY:  God help us all.Coming up next tonight on this busy news night right here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  This guy Ted Cruz -- Ted Cruz goes out.  You talk about liars!SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Donald Trump is very rattled right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, this week, Donald Trump, Senator Ted Cruz sharpened their attacks against each other, and Hillary Clinton continued to lose to a 74-year-old crotchety curmudgeon socialist of Vermont.  We'll check in with Tucker Carlson and Leslie Marshall.  And we'll also debate the question of who won the week in politics.  That's coming up.And later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  If I'm president, we will indeed make America great again.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I will unite the conservative movement.  I will grow the conservative movement.  And we will win this election.CRUZ:  If you're fed up with Washington cronyism, I ask for your support.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, coming up in a ""Hannity"" exclusive, we went to all the 2016 Republican candidates to make their final pitches to you, the voters, before next week's primary.  We gave them 60 to 90 seconds.That and a whole lot more straight ahead tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to ""Hannity.""  Now, it's been a very interesting week in the 2016 presidential race.  On the Republican side, you have Senator Ted Cruz -- he won the Iowa GOP caucuses -- and his war of words with Donald Trump, of course, escalated.  On the Democratic side, Hillary - - well, I would argue she lost to Bernie Sanders Iowa and she struggled to answer many questions during a Democratic town hall and debate.  So who won the week?Joining us now, FOX News contributors Tucker Carlson, Leslie Marshall.  All right, who won the week, Leslie?  Don't say Hillary because I'm going to cut you off and cast you into the shadows.  Who?LESLIE MARSHALL, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  OK.  On the -- I can say left and right, right?  On the left, I am a Hillary supporter.  However, I think Bernie Sanders won the week, and not because of debates or town hall meetings, because of the number of youth that he had come out and people first time to caucus in Iowa, because of how well he did in Iowa, how well he's doing right now in New Hampshire via the polls and how much money he raised in a 24-hour period in a grass roots effort.On the right, Marco Rubio.  Marco Rubio has definitely...HANNITY:  How does the...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Wait a minute!(CROSSTALK)MARSHALL:  ... coming in second in New Hampshire.HANNITY:  How does the -- as Trump and Cruz have been complaining, I think with a little bit of justification, Marco came in third.  He had a great performance.  I think Marco's poll numbers in New Hampshire look good.  Nationally, he's doing well.  I'm not -- I think he did well, but how does he get the -- how, when you come in third, do you win the week?  Because you were expected to come in seventh?LESLIE MARSHALL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  No.  Well, that is part of it.  No.   Because --HANNITY:  He was expected to come in third.  MARSHALL:  No, because I told you.  I you this before and I'm saying it again.  I think Marco Rubio is going to win New Hampshire, and I am a Democrat that doesn't want this guy to win or to be the nominee because I think he's the toughest for Hillary or Bernie to beat.  But I think Marco Rubio's the guy to watch.  New Hampshire voters are very different than Iowa voters.  HANNITY:  All right, I got it.  MARSHALL:  They are not evangelicals.  They are more moderate.  They are very different and I think they are going to go for Marco Rubio.  TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  I hate to say it, but I agree with Leslie, but for entirely different reasons.  Bernie lost Iowa because of the North Korean coin toss, but he's won the argument.  He's completely defined what it is to be a Democrat in 2016.  Hillary is not setting the terms of the debate.  You saw the debate the other night.  He is.  She is trying to become the socialist that he's been for 30 years, so he is totally in charge of the Democratic Party right now amazingly enough.  And on the Republican side, I agree with you completely, it must be frustrating for the other candidates to see the man who came in third declared the winner, but he is the winner in this one sense.  The donor class has swung behind him and that's going to become really obvious I think if it isn't already, and the conservative establishment, the Republican establishment in Washington has decided he's the only acceptable candidate.  So we'll see what the actual voters think of that but, his Iowa performance really did elevate him to that in their eyes.  HANNITY:  I think the person with the worst moment of the week is Hillary. Let me tell you why.  Go back and remember there was a guy supposed to win Iowa, and his name was Howard Dean.  And when he lost he had a meltdown.  You may remember this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOWARD DEAN, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Not only are we going to New Hampshire, Tom Harkin, we are going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico!  We're going to California and Texas and New York!  And we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan!  And then we're going to Washington, D.C. to take back the White House!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  He was laughing.  He was happy.  Hillary was not happy with the results, and as our own Ed Henry reported, she was supposed to be introduced by Chelsea and by Bill.  Then she comes out in the middle of a Tom Harkin speech.  There she is, not expecting her.  No rope line, no introduction, and her Howard Dean moment.  Angry, and she shoots all the way to the left.  Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  I know we can create more good paying jobs and raise incomes for hard working Americans again.  I know that we can finish the job of universal health care coverage for every single man, woman, and child.  (APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  I know we can combat climate change and be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.  (APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  I know we can make college affordable and get student debt off the backs of young people.  (APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  I think that's a disaster.  It's going to come back politically, Tucker, to hurt her in a general election because she sounds more liberal, socialist than Bernie.  And the anger issue, she's already not likable.  CARLSON:  The whole point of the Hillary candidacy was she's reasonable.  She's been around.  She's liberal but she's not crazy.  She didn't honeymoon in the Soviet Union.  And all of a sudden she is aping Bernie Sanders because she's weak.  They're totally afraid.  Bernie Sanders raised more money this past week than she did.  I don't think he's going to be the nominee, but I'm amazed at how easy it is to rattle Hillary Clinton.  She's much more brittle, much more fragile than any of us imagined she was.   That's the real lesson I think.  HANNITY:  The fact that you don't see this, in the light that I do, Leslie, means that I think you're just not seeing Hillary.  Sixth-some odd percent of Americans don't like her, don't think she's honest and trustworthy.  How do you win with that?  MARSHALL:  If you look at the national polls, and I'm not talking Quinnipiac who seems to have a love affair with Senator Sanders, she has a healthy lead --HANNITY:  A poll came out today, 44-42.  MARSHALL:  That's -- I'm talking about Quinnipiac.  That's the only poll.  If you look at Real Clear Politics, which I know you like, Sean, she has a much healthier lead --HANNITY:  Bernie caught up big time this week.  MARSHALL:  And other than Rubio she has a chance to beat all the other GOP candidates.  It's funny when you say I can't believe you don't see this as I see it.  I'm sitting here thinking the same thing about you, Sean.  I don't see that as crazy.  I see that as passion.  HANNITY:  Passion?  MARSHALL:  I don't see that as anger.  I see that as excitement and rallying the troops.HANNITY:  Excitement?  MARSHALL:  No.  I see her being excited, passionate, rallying her troops, rallying her base.  HANNITY:  I see her scared to death of a socialist, and she now had to push herself even further to the left, Tucker, and she did it out of frustration because she didn't perform well in Iowa.  CARLSON:  Frustration and terror.  I mean, Hillary if you think about it for a second has only won two elections, both of them totally inside jobs in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, New York.  She lined up support from the people who run the party and she was sort of guided through Election Day.  There's no evidence at all that she's good at this.  By the way, I don't think she's bad at everything, but she's terrible at running for office.  She doesn't have deep and firm beliefs, and it's all embarrassingly on display when she tries to run.  HANNITY:  Add to that the un-likability factor, when you add to that people feel she's dishonest, a liar, not trustworthy, and add to that I think anger in a speech, and then she's moving real hard left, I don't think that going to play well in the general election.  But, Leslie, I'll take your comments on face value, and I know you love her.  Thank you, guys, for being with us.  Appreciate it, thank you.  All right, Super Bowl predictions, quick.  Who do you like?  Quick, Leslie, pick.  MARSHALL:  Oh, oh, who's playing?  No.  Just joking.  I'm going to go for --HANNITY:  Quick.  MARSHALL:  I'm going for the Denver Broncos.  HANNITY:  Tucker?  CARLSON:  Panthers, come on.  HANNITY:  My heart says Peyton.  My head say the Panthers, but I'm going with Denver.  Coming next, on ""Hannity"" --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  If I'm president, we will, indeed, make America great again.  RUBIO:  I will unite the conservative movement.  I will grow the conservative movement, and we will win this election.  CRUZ:  If you're fed up with Washington cronyism, I ask for your support.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Coming up, a ""Hannity"" exclusive.  The 2016 GOP presidential candidates, we went, we gave them a camera, and they made their final pitch to you, the voters, before the New Hampshire primary, that and more on this busy news night on ""Hannity.""  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to ""Hannity.""  So in just four days the voters in New Hampshire will cast their ballots.  And over the past 48 hours we tracked down the very busy presidential candidates and we asked all of them to give us their final pitch to you, the voters, especially in the granite state.   This is something you'll only see right here on ""Hannity.""  Here's part one.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TRUMP:  My theme is ""Make America Great Again.""  We're losing with China, with Mexico, with Japan on trade.  Everybody's beating us.  Billions and billions of dollars is gone.  We have people that don't know what they're doing.  We have a president that doesn't know what he's doing.  Our military is being depleted.  Our veterans aren't taken care of.  Our borders are open and people are pouring through like water.  We can't continue to do things like this.  Obamacare is a disaster.  It's got to be repealed and replaced.  I'll do that immediately.  We have to preserve our Second Amendment.  We have to get rid of Common Core.  There's so many things to do, but we're going to do them.  If I'm president, we will, indeed, make America great again.  RUBIO:  Hi, this is Marco Rubio.  Here in New Hampshire next Tuesday you have an important decision to make.  This election is not just a choice basically candidates or political parties.  This election is a referendum on our identity as a nation and as a people.  This is the greatest country in the history of the world.  But after seven years of Barack Obama a lot of the things that make America special are now under assault and doubt.  We cannot lose this election.  We cannot lose to Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton.  We have to win.  If I'm our nominee we will win.  I will unite the conservative movement.  I will grow the conservative movement, and we will win this election and then begin the hard work of turning this great country around.  That's why this Tuesday I am asking you for your vote to that together we can leave for our children what our parents left us -- the single greatest nation in the history of all mankind.  Thank you for listening to me.  God bless all of you in New Hampshire.  I'll see you Tuesday.  CRUZ:  Monday night Iowa shocked the Washington establishment.  All of the pundits said we would lose.  But the Reagan coalition came together and the grassroots won a stunning victory.  In Iowa, I campaigned openly against the ethanol mandate, something everyone said was political suicide, and yet the people of Iowa rose up and said our country is more important.  To the people of New Hampshire and South Carolina, if you're fed up with Washington cronyism, I ask for your support.  If you want a president who will repeal Obamacare, ask who led the fight against Obamacare.  If you want a president who will stop amnesty, ask who led the fight against the Rubio-Schumer amnesty deal.  If you want a president who will defend the Second Amendment, ask who led the fight against Obama's assault on our right to keep and bear arms.  I have spent my whole life defending the constitution, and if we stand together we can and will restore America.  JOHN KASICH, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I've been a leader that's balanced budgets, cut taxes, created a good environment for job creation, and raised an opportunity for everybody to succeed.  In other words, build a strong economy and make sure we leave no one behind.  And I've been able to do it working both with Republicans and Democrats to bring people together to lift our country.  You know, at the end of the day we may be Republicans and Democrats, but at the end, we are Americans, and working together we can solve our most vexing problems and renew the spirit of America.  (END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY:  And coming up next, right here tonight on ""Hannity"" --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEB BUSH, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  On Tuesday night voters will be able to decide who can keep them safer, stronger, and freer.  I have detailed plans to do just that.  CARLY FIORINA, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Citizens, it's time to take our country back.  BEN CARSON, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm not a politician, and I'm not going to do the things the way politicians do.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  We'll have more of the candidates and their final pitches before the very important New Hampshire primary.  You'll only see their pitches right here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to ""Hannity.""  Here is part two of our ""Hannity"" exclusive, the final pitches before the New Hampshire primary from the Republican presidential candidates in their own words.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BUSH:  Tuesday night, voters will be able to decide who can keep them safer, stronger, and freer.  I have detailed plans to do just that and a proven record that they can count on, a record of cutting taxes, of reforming our schools, of regulating -- deregulating our economy so that we led the nation in job growth in Florida during my eight years.  We need to bring that philosophy to Washington, D.C.  We can do this.  We can have rising income for the middle class again, but it's going to require a proven leader who can take on the bureaucracy and the status quo and the culture of Washington to fix those things so that our economy can rise up.  And finally, we need someone with a steady hand to be commander in chief that has the fact of the military so that we can destroy ISIS and the caliphate that has been formed and keep us safe.  I ask for your support Tuesday night.FIORINA:  Voters of New Hampshire, citizens of this great nation, your power is being taken from you day after day after day ay a government that no longer serves you, by a professional political class that no longer responds to you.  Citizens, it's time to take our country back.  That is why I'm running for president.  It's why I have laid out a blueprint of the most important things we need to do together to restore a citizen government, to force our government to work for those of us who pay for it.  This country has always been a nation of limitless possibilities.  It needs to be so, again.  So citizens, stand with me, fight with me.  Don't sit down and be quiet.  Don't settle for what we're settling for now.   Citizens, it's time to take our country back.  CARSON:  I'm delighted to be in New Hampshire.  I've been here I think 14 or 15 times.  Some people say no, you have to be there 50 or 60 times.  But, you know, I think the people of New Hampshire are pretty smart from what I've seen in my conversations with them.  They have the ability to listen to the times I've been here.Go to my website, BenCarson.com.  I think I have more policy than anybody.  And that's really how you make decisions.  I will be here as much as possible, looking very much forward to the debate.  And the reason that I hope people will vote for me is because I'm not a politician, and I'm not going to do the things the way politicians do.  I don't accept money from special interests and I don't accept money from billionaires who want to influence things.  So it's going to be different, no question about it, but that is what we need now.  JIM GILMORE, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm Jim Gilmore, Republican president for president of the United States.  As you go towards voting it's time for you to consider who actually has the credentials to actually be the president of the United States and to be the commander in chief.  I'm the former governor of Virginia, former elected prosecutor, attorney general, and chairman of the National Commission on Terrorism and Weapons of Mass Destruction.  I was the governor during the 9/11 attack.  And I'm the only veteran in this race, someone who actually has military experience.  I'm a person who actually cares about the rights of veterans and the reforms necessary to look after veterans in this country, and I know what to do in order to achieve that.  And I'm and on the board of the National Rifle Association, and I stand strongly for the rights of people in the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms.  And the real credentials that I have to address the international challenge that we're facing today not only from nation states like Russia and China and Iran and North Korea but also from radical Islamism around the world, I have the experience and the program to keep America safe and do what is necessary to be the real commander in chief and a real president, not just for everybody else, but for the people of the United States.  I'm not a candidate just throwing insults back and forth.  I'm a candidate who actually wants to serve you as president of the United States.  (END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY:  The candidates in their own words.  When we come back, we need your help.  Our ""Question of the Day"" is next.      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  All right, time for our ""Question of the Day."" So which candidate do you think made the best final pitch?
