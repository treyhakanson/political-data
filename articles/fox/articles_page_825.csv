This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  This week on the ""Journal: Editorial Report,"" fellow Republicans begin a campaign to take down Donald Trump but will the strategy really hurt the GOP front runner?  And who is the most likely to benefit?Plus, as protests continue to spread at colleges across the country, is free speech the latest casualty of the campus left.All that, and Wall Street Journal columnist, Peggy Noonan, on culture, politics and the time of our lives.But first, these headlines.(FOX NEWS REPORT)GIGOT:  Welcome to the ""Journal: Editorial Report.""  I'm Paul Gigot.Well, as Donald Trump continues to hold his lead in national polls in an early primary state, the ""Wall Street Journal"" reported last week that some GOP super PACs are setting their sights on the Republican front-runner.  This week, one supporting Ohio Governor John Kasich released its first direct attack featuring some of Trump's more controversial comments.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He's not a war hero.  (CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  He's a war hero because he was captured.  If Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.  (LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's so weird.  TRUMP (voice-over):  I have a great relationship with the blacks.  I have always had a great relationship with the blacks.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The blacks.  TRUMP:  Well, I just don't respect her as a journalist.  You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her -- wherever.  Somebody's doing the raping, Don.  You know, I mean, somebody is doing it.  There are women being raped.  Who's doing the raping?  It moves this way.  It moves this way.  How stupid are the people of Iowa?  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; columnist, Jason Riley; and columnist, Kim Strassel.  So, Kim, let's stipulate since the Paris attack, Donald Trump has risen in the polls a few points in Iowa and the early states.  It hasn't hurt them.  Is this kind of saying he isn't presidential, shouldn't be trusted to be commander-in-chief?  Is this the kind of attack that will work against Donald Trump?  KIM STRASSEL, COLUMNIST:  The people putting it out there hope this one will work.  They have tried pretty much everything else.  They have gone after him for his past liberal positions.  They have gone after his policy positions that he has now, things like eminent domain, which aren't necessarily Kentucky.  This is a new attempt to say, do you really want this guy in charge?  GIGOT:  What do you think, Kim?  Is it going to work?  STRASSEL:  There is a possibility that it will.  The electorate is unsettled after Paris.  They want steady leadership.  Some immediate things he said have given him help in the polls.  As people look at it more closely and as the ad made clear, there will be more to come, this is a renewed focus on bringing him down.  GIGOT:  Kim doesn't sound confident that it will work.  (LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST:  It's interesting.  This Kasich super PAC is merely a vessel for a lot of people to put forward the attacks --  GIGOT:  Oh, absolutely.  RILEY:  -- Donald Trump.  A lot of people putting money into this aren't even John Kasich supporters.  GIGOT:  That's correct.  RILEY:  So there are a lot of people.  I think there is some desperation on the part of the Republican Party.  They fear that if Donald Trump is the nominee, they could lose in a landslide to Hillary Clinton, presumed Democratic nominee.  And it is simply because he's managed to offend so many subgroups from Muslims to blacks to --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Hispanics.  GIGOT:  -- Hispanics.  The country is so diverse.  The Republican Party feels it needs to tap in to some of these voters come the next election.  He's just offended too many people.  GIGOT:  These are the quotes, Dan.  They are using Donald Trump's words against him.  I talked to Republicans and their reaction is who cares what he says?  It doesn't matter.  He's just sticking it to the man.  He's standing up to all the media, you, me, media elites.  Standing up to them so good for him.  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR:  Yeah.  I think that has a lot to do with it.  His support seems to be solid at around 25 percent.  Goes up sometimes, down a little bit.  I think Trump is conveying contempt for the political system.  That reflects that 25 percent.  They, too, have contempt for what's going on in the political system and can't be moved off --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  So do we sometimes.  HENNINGER:  Having said that, I think since the Paris attacks and the elevation, again, of the war on terror and what we are going to do about it.  Donald Trump has suddenly become vulnerable.  Questions will be asked whether he could serve as commander-in-chief.  I believe the rise of Ted Cruz in the latest poll this week in Iowa, at the expense of Ben Carson, the one who is immediately suffering because he may not have the --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  The commander-in-chief credentials.  HENNINGER:  -- commander-in-chief.  Is beginning to show that people are focused now on substance.  Trump could have a problem there.  RILEY:  I agree.  Carson clearly has shown since Paris he doesn't have a command of foreign policy that people are looking for.  Cruz is able to take advantage of it.  Trump doesn't have the expertise either, by the way.  He just has bluster.  Carson doesn't do bluster.  GIGOT:  He has attitude.  RILEY:  Yeah.  So I see that.  The problem I think Cruz has is he's managed to consolidate the most conservative elements of the GOP base.  You still have more moderate elements, business folks that are not satisfied with Cruz.  He'll have to work on getting people outside of his conservative base.  There is work to be done there.  GIGOT:  Kim, who else?  Ted Cruz might benefit.  Who else might benefit if Donald Trump slides in the polls for the reasons Jason mentioned?  STRASSEL:  Potentially anyone.  And I think that his why you see --  GIGOT:  Anyone?  STRASSEL:  -- so many of the donors willing to put money into the super PACs to go after him.  There are so many people in this race.  Things remain so fluid.  You talked about Ben Carson.  He shed a few points and it went to Ted Cruz and now people are talking about Ted Cruz as a contender in Iowa.  All of these other candidates are thinking if they could pull off seven or eight points from Donald Trump and it went to one of them or any of them that would be the opportunity to break out.  You have seen Chris Christie up in New Hampshire.  He's been very dogged in the work he's doing up there.  But he's having a moment, too, taking some points away from other people.  This is just still a very fluid race.  GIGOT:  I agree.  I agree with you, Kim.  People should watch Chris Christie.  The New Jersey governor is somebody who is trying to hit the theme of commander-in-chief.  Somebody, day one, serious.  He has a really solid, blunt manner, but not with some of the extreme statements Donald Trump has.  All right.  When we come back, as protests continue to spread at colleges nationwide, is free speech the latest casualty of the campus left?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CHANTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Well, from California to New Hampshire, protests have now spread to an estimated 100 college campuses with students alleging systematic racial injustice.  At Dartmouth last week, about 150 protesters stormed the library chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and reportedly cussing at students as they studied.  The protests at Dartmouth and elsewhere follow the resignation earlier this month of the University of Missouri's president after students there claimed he didn't do enough to address issues of racial intolerance on campus.  We are back with Dan Henninger and Jason Riley.  And Wall Street Journal assistant editorial features editor, Kate Bachelder, also joins us.  So, Kate, these institutions we're talking about are some of the most racially and gender conscious in the history of mankind, if I can use that word.  (LAUGHTER)Yet, these students are protesting racial and gender insensitivity.  What's going on?  KATE BACHELDER, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL FEATURES EDITOR:  These are also, Paul, some of the most prestigious institutions in American history, right?  That sends students into the world to accomplish huge things.  What's going on here is students have basically been allowed to demand whatever they want, different curriculum, different faculty, and they are succeeding with administrators.  So why not?  Some tossed in ""Please renovate our dorms.""  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  Better health care!BACHELDER:  Right.  (LAUGHTER)BACHELDER:  If you have administrators willing to give you what you want, you will ask for a lot.  HENNINGER:  Honestly, I think this has been going on for a long time.  You have the office of diversity affairs in place for at least 15 years.  They have gotten bigger and bigger.  The left supported it.  I would go so far as to say what's happening here is a coup d'etat.  Coup de university.  They are trying to seize power at these universities.(CROSSTALK)  GIGOT:  A children's coup?  HENNINGER:  A children's coup.  (LAUGHTER)At the University of Missouri they drove the president out of office.  They did with the dean at Claremont McKenna.  They will ruin these places once they gain control of them but I don't think they care about that.  GIGOT:  Isn't free speech implicated here, Kate?  One of the things they don't like is when people dissent or speak up.  At Dartmouth, the protesters said they were criticizing the students because the students were studying instead of joining them in the protest.  They were accused of racial insensitivity for not joining the protest.  BACHELDER:  Yes.  There is a disconnect between what students are asking for and what the sympathizers in the press are saying.  Oh, no, they are not trying to kill free speech.  The students say we don't want what offends us, programs and courses we don't like from people who are sinners and bad people.  This is -- basically there is a disconnect.  People aren't believing them for what they are saying, which is that we don't want free speech on campus.  GIGOT:  Banishing Woodrow Wilson from Princeton.  RILEY:  These kids are not victims of discrimination.  They're victims of liberalism, is what they are.  For the past 50 years, the left has controlled these campuses.  They have bent over backwards to make them more inclusive, more diverse using affirmative action, creating ethnic and gender studies program and so forth.  What they have inadvertently created is a culture of grievance, which is what we are seeing on display here.  To the extent they give in to these demands, they will only exacerbate the problem.  These kids mistake slogans like Black Lives Matter for arguments.  They don't know how to coherently address issues and policies.  It's sad.  These are bright kids who have been, I think, nurtured to the point where they are unable to coherently express a point of view.  GIGOT:  Is there any pushback on administrators, students, anywhere across this system?  BACHELDER:  At Princeton, a group of students sent a letter requesting a meeting with the president, not occupying his office --(LAUGHTER)-- and asking to discuss concerns that the university is an intellectual space, not a safe space, is under threat.  GIGOT:  Will they get the meeting?  BACHELDER:  That's a good question.(LAUGHTER)He should have said, come right now, I'm free immediately.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  The larger question is why is there so little pushback other than isolated incidents like this, by a few students who, let's face it, will probably be vilified for doing this once word gets out who they are.  HENNINGER:  I think often the presidents feel there is federal money at risk.  They don't want to inflame the federal government that controls the purse strings.  But the real question is, where are --(CROSSTALK)  GIGOT:  Because the federal government is pushing these kinds of --(CROSSTALK)HENNINGER:  Student loans, Pell grants, plus --(CROSSTALK)HENNINGER:  The government under Obama has been suggesting there should be more of this sort of thing.  But where are the boards of trustees of the universities, the adults who supposedly are trying to maintain them as places of learning instead of places of chaos?  GIGOT:  Is that the answer, Kate?  Basically, we'll hold your checkbook if you're a donor?  I mean, you know.BACHELDER:  I'm not sure.  I think being more involved in going to campus, putting pressure on these trustees and presidents and saying, hey, this isn't what the institution stands for is a better route.  GIGOT:  I don't think that's going to happen, as much as I wish it would.  (LAUGHTER)All right, thank you all.  When we come back, Wall Street Journal columnist, Peggy Noonan, joins us with her take on campus culture and campaign politics.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  There's nobody better to weigh in on the current battles being waged on college campuses and the campaign trail than Wall Street Journal columnist, Peggy Noonan.  She is the author of the new book ""The Time of Our Lives, A Collection of Writings on Politics and Culture.""  Peggy, welcome back to the show.  PEGGY NOONAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL COLUMNIST:  Thank you, Paul.  Thank you.  GIGOT:  So a question I get a lot about is this is a book of a collection of your writings and some auto biographical information on how you became a writer.  Is it harder in your estimation to write for somebody else as you did for politicians and presidents or under your own name?  NOONAN:  It's very funny.  A variation on what you just asked is the question I get, which is how do you find your voice?  I tell people, you have a voice, you sound just like you when you write because you are you.  (LAUGHTER)When I was writing for Ronald Reagan, we knew what he knew, what he'd read.  You could listen to him and hear a certain rolling speech, a kind of easy, ambling speech.  (CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  You have to find his voice.  NOONAN:  You have to find his voice.  That's how I imagined him.  I have never quite defined how I expressed myself.  I would probably get self- conscious --(LAUGHTER)-- if I did.  It just occurred to me.  GIGOT:  And we'd see what that is.  NOONAN:  It's easier for you to be yourself, sure.  GIGOT:  OK.  Let's talk about the college campus uprisings.  You've watched them.  What do you make of this?  NOONAN:  I think it is a real movement that we are properly alarmed about.   This is an actual movement that is a censorship movement that is being carried out by people who seem to have no awareness of, understanding of, or appreciation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  They seem to me -- they claim to be intimidated.  ""I need a safe space.  You can't say things that hurt me.""  In fact, when you watch them on videotape at all of these schools, they're surrounding people, trying to push them away.  They seem not intimidated, but intimidators.  It feels -- I've been trying to figure out, what is the right word?  Is this Stalinist?  Is this like the Chinese cultural revolution?  The most irritating thing about it perhaps is that these young people are very lucky and don't seem to know it.  They're operating at America's greatest universities.  They are so lucky.  GIGOT:  Some of them are elite.  They're going to run the country.  NOONAN:  Yes.  They come from something lucky is sort of what you can infer from the pictures of them.  And what they have from that is bitterness and wild anger, which doesn't make sense.  But anyway, I think they should be stopped.  I wish an administrator would stand up and say, guess what, we stand for academic freedom here, intellectual freedom.  The free exchange of ideas, they may hurt you, they may make you happy, it doesn't matter.  This is life.  We stand for that.  If you can't take it, you're allowed to leave.  This isn't prison.  It's a college you paid to go to.  GIGOT:  Let's talk about the presidential campaign.  You've written a lot about the outsiders in the campaign, the populist, for lack of a better word,  mood out there in the general electorate.  What do you make of the Trump phenomenon?  Could he win the nomination?  NOONAN:  I think he could win the nomination.  I think it might come down, as Dan Henninger says, it might come down to a heck of a fight at the convention between --(LAUGHTER)  GIGOT:  We're not that lucky, Petty.  I don't know.  (LAUGHTER)NOONAN:  -- forces and establishment forces, whatever these words mean now.But one of the things going on about Trump is that he's making a big mistake.  When Trump first came forward and announced and garnered popularity, he got that popular because he hit a nerve about immigration --GIGOT:  Right.NOONAN:  -- illegal immigration.  I am going to stop.  I'm going to build an actual wall.  I'm going to make that end.  People want that.  They like it.  You can see it in the polls.  Then he goes to, and by the way, we're going to deport 10 million immigrants that live here.  Nobody really knows the number.  Everybody is fibbing or really just unformed.  Here's the thing.  I talked to Trump supporters all the time.  They are in love with this stop illegal immigration.  They're not in love with this deportation stuff.  They never talk about it.  I think they believe he's kidding about deporting people, but serious about the wall.  GIGOT:  Fascinating.NOONAN:  Yeah.GIGOT:  Very interesting. Peggy Noonan, thank you.  The book, ""The Time of Our Lives.""  Thanks for coming. We have to take one more break.  When we come back, ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Time now for our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.  Kim, start us off.STRASSEL:  A hit to Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley who is simply refusing to let this Clinton e-mail scandal fade away.  In the past week, Senator Grassley has sent a letter to the woman who we now know was in charge of deleting some of Hillary Clinton's e-mails to ask more about that process.  He's got a hold on a senior State Department senior official that the president has nominated and says he will not allow that appointment to go forward until he gets more documents from the State Department.  The Clintons depend on this, on the media and the public losing interest in their misdeeds, so good for Senator Grassley for not letting it drop.  GIGOT:  All right, thanks, Kim.Kate?BACHELDER:  This is a miss for a Texas family who is suing a city and school district for $15 million in damages.  A young boy brought in a clock and his teachers overreacted and thought it was a bomb.  But as an apology for this, he won an invitation to the White House to chat with the president.  (LAUGHTER)He got internship offers from Twitter messages from Mark Zuckerberg and many more.  But this was not enough.  And the family announced they are moving to Qatar, but not before shaking down a school district.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  All right.Dan?HENNINGER:  This is a miss that even Democrats themselves talk about, which is that once you get past Barack Obama, the only conceivable Democrats who could run for president are all oldies but goods, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, John Kerry.  There's just no up-and-comers in the party.  Look no further than the announcement this week by Congressman John Conyers, of Detroit, that he would run again.  He has been in Congress since 1964.  27 terms.  These impenetrably safe House seats and Senate seats are the reason the Democrats have turned into a gerontocracy.  GIGOT:  All right, Dan, thank you.  Remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us @jeronfnc.  That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel and especially to all of you for watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Toy StoryThe Etch A Sketch comment that's taken over the campaign has shaken up sales for the toy.The company that makes it has seen its stock price almost triple since Wednesday when an adviser to Mitt Romney compared the pivot to a general election campaign to shaking an Etch A Sketch.Amazon sales for the toy are reportedly up 3,000 percent.The toy maker isn't taking sides in the race though noting -- quote-- ""We have a left knob and a right knob so we neutrally speak to both parties.""Unlikely AlliesYou know the saying, politics makes strange bedfellows?Well, it's happening in Georgia.Tea Party supporters are standing with organized labor to protest an anti-picketing law that both groups say will limit free speech.The bill, which passed the Georgia Senate, would ban picketing at private residences and certain businesses in a labor dispute.One Tea Party activist tells a local TV station it's unfair to single out a group no matter who they are because -- quote-- ""What would prevent a county government or a city government from saying, 'We don't want the Tea Party or anti-abortion groups to protest in this area, but we're going to allow the union to protest in this area'?""Secret to SuccessIn a video posted by the White House President Obama received some sage advice about marriage that could translate to politics as well.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It is a great honor to meet you.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, the Clinton smear machine hits a brand-new low, releasing a blatantly false ad that tries to paint and tie Donald Trump to the KKK and white supremacists.  Here's just part of that ad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The reason a lot of Klan members like Donald Trump is because a lot of what he believes, we believe in. Donald Trump would be best for the job.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For president?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am a farmer and a white nationalist. Support Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Pretty despicable and disgusting, but Hillary Clinton is not stopping there. Now, earlier today, she gave a major speech accusing Donald Trump of actually being a racist, which she knows is false.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: From the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party.  His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: A new low. Pretty unbelievable. Also earlier today, before Clinton's speech, Donald Trump preemptively -- he struck back at the untruthful narrative that Clinton is now pushing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Voters are used to the old game where failed politicians like Hillary, who did lose to Barack Obama rather decisively, an election she was supposed to win easily -- please don't forget that -- where she falsely smears Republicans with the charges of racism and other things. Republicans then always have a tendency to back down and be defensive and look bad. Not Donald Trump!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And Hillary Clinton has been having a horrible couple of weeks here, an AP report further exposing the Clinton Foundation's pay-to-play scheme. So in order to divert attention from the American people, your attention away from her corruption candidacy, well, Clinton is trying to play the race card.And as Trump said earlier today, this is just an old trick from the Democrats' playbook. But when the left uses it, they ignore their own rampant history of racism.You may remember Democratic senator Robert Byrd. Well, he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and he filibustered the Civil Rights legislation. Now, here's Hillary praising the former Klansman, Robert Byrd, after his death in 2010.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Senator Byrd was a man of surpassing eloquence and nobility.  From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless advocacy for his West Virginia constituents. As secretary of state, I continue to rely on his advice and counsel.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Seems every election, this card is played. There's also former Democratic vice presidential candidate Al Gore. Remember, he made these ridiculous accusations. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. AL GORE (D), TENNESSEE: It's wrong, what the leader of the Republican Party and this Congress are doing in blocking an accurate census because they don't want to count everyone that they don't think they can count on.They are in favor of affirmative action if you can dunk the basketball or sink a three-point shot!(LAUGHTER)GORE: But they're not in favor of it if you merely have the potential to be a leader in your community and bring people together! Don't tell me we've got a colorblind society!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: They don't even want to count you in the census -- that's the race card. We can't forget about these two old campaign ads from Democrats that push disturbing falsehoods. Let's take a look at more of this history.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you don't vote, you let another church explode.  When you don't vote, you allow another cross to burn.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On June 7th, 1998, in Texas, my father was killed.  He was beaten, chained, and then dragged three miles to his death all because he was black. So when Governor George W. Bush refused to support hate crimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Well, actually, George Bush supported the death penalty for that individual. And of course, a lot of these ads are just lies. just a few examples of how low the Democratic Party will sink every four years in order to scare voters into trying to win elections.Now, while Clinton is pushing this unfounded and outright false narrative about Donald Trump, well, she ignores how her own party and President Obama have failed the black community. Now, under President Obama, the number of African-Americans on food stamps has gone up a whopping 58 percent. What a failure. Also under Obama the last eight years, African-Americans in poverty -- that's jumped more than 8 percent. And since Obama took office, the number of African-Americans out of the labor force has jumped by 20 percent.Now, the home ownership rate for African-Americans is also down 4.6 percent under this president. And to top it all off, African-Americans' median income has also fallen in real dollars since 2009.Here with reaction is the editor-in-chief of Lifezette.com, FOX news contributor Laura Ingraham. Every two to four years -- Republicans don't want to count you in the census, Republicans are racist, they're sexist, they're anti-gay. How should Donald Trump react to this?LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think his reaction today was really spot on, Sean. He called Hillary out for her record of failures in creating jobs with the Obama administration. He talked about school choice. He talked about the cynical ploy of using the race card every time you're up against the wall, which the Democratic Party is because they have failed all communities in this country on the job creation and wage-raising issues.So when they can't defend a record, when they really don't want to debate the issues, they have to go to this. And they would have done it in different ways to other candidates. People think, Oh, it's only because Donald Trump is running. But we saw what they've tried to do to Republicans in the past, and Tom Sowell, I think, said it best. He said black votes are really what matters.To the extent that Obama and Hillary care about the lives of individual black Americans, to the extent they care about them, they care about their votes more. So as long as you keep people divided, Sean, and polarized, that keeps the heat off the Democrats and their own record.HANNITY: You know...INGRAHAM: The more racial harmony we have, the less we're going to see of people like Al Sharpton.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... coincidence, though, that -- you know, this is the week she was exposed.INGRAHAM: Yes.HANNITY: I mean, more than half the people that she met with while secretary of state were either donors or people that promised money to the Clinton Foundation. So I don't think this is any accident, the timing of her doing this. Do you agree on the timing issue?INGRAHAM: I think the timing also has something to do with Trump's outreach to the minority community. I think they're in total freak-out mode over his outreach. And you know how right off the bat, they said, Oh, he's not really doing outreach. They're doing outreach to white voters.  And he doesn't really care. This is all just a cynical ploy.Well, if it's not going to work, then why are they so worked up about it?  So they have to put out this other narrative that, well, this -- this, you know, random KKK leader said something about Trump. The whole thing is so ridiculous! I think you pointed out a few weeks back that the U.S. Communist Party supports Hillary.HANNITY: You know...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Think of the double standard. All right, so J. William Fulbright is a known segregationist. Bill Clinton swears, Well, that was -- that's my mentor.INGRAHAM: Yes.HANNITY: Robert Byrd, the former Klansman, is Hillary's mentor. You know, let's go back. This wasn't even that long ago, back in 2012, New Yorker magazine. This is Bill Clinton actually quoted as saying, Tim Russert told me that according to sources, Bill Clinton, in an effort to secure the endorsement for Hillary from Ted Kennedy, also said, Hey, a few years back, this guy would have been carrying our bags, talking about Obama. He has taken his advocacy on behalf of his wife to a level that is pretty troubling.Now, imagine Donald Trump -- imagine the outrage! That would have ended anybody else's career!INGRAHAM: Right. Well, this is what happens when you have a compliant media. To see what some of our other cable channel friends are saying today -- they merely just parrot what Hillary says about Donald Trump, which is so despicable. It's so toxic for the national dialogue.We have really important issues facing the country. Hillary should come out of hiding, come out of her late-night comedy show appearances and actually debate the issues that matter. She is -- I call her Hideaway Hillary now, Sean, because she just will not answer questions. She's not going to do press conferences.HANNITY: Hideaway Hillary?INGRAHAM: Yes, Hideaway Hillary. She's going to hide away until the election, try to run out the clock. But...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: If we're going to do guilt by association -- I didn't mean to interrupt you. I apologize. If we're going to do guilt by association, OK, Hillary has embraced the Black Lives Matter movement. You know, what do we want? Dead cops.INGRAHAM: Racist movement.HANNITY: When do we want them? Now.INGRAHAM: That's truly a racist movement.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: She's also embraced the Reverend Al Sharpton. Let's listen to some of the golden oldies of her friend Reverend Sharpton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REV. AL SHARPTON, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: (INAUDIBLE) because you ain't nothing. You're a punk (EXPLETIVE DELETED) so come and do something.We the black chicken fryers of the universe. (INAUDIBLE)(INAUDIBLE) (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (INAUDIBLE) (EXPLETIVE DELETED)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: So here's my question. So she's friends with Black Lives Matter.  She's friends and seeks the approval of Al Sharpton. Then she takes money from countries like Saudi Arabia, that kill gays and lesbians, that discriminate against women, Christians and Jews.I think she's got a bigger problem than Trump. Should Trump use that?INGRAHAM: I think you're right, Sean. I get the sense in just talking to just regular folks who aren't all that into politics, people are really tired of this. I think Walter Williams, Tom Sowell, folks have written wonderful things about this, that racial unity, racial harmony hurts people like Al Sharpton. It kills off the radicals on the left.It hurts Hillary Clinton. It hurts Barack Obama because what they really care about, not so much about what's happening in the inner city, whether there's violence. What they really want is power, and they want to keep the dependency game going in the inner cities.If people stop being dependent on government, people start thinking for themselves, their game is up. I think they know it.HANNITY: I think you hit on something earlier, too, that I agree with, and that is Donald Trump now is reaching out in a major way. He started with his speech in Milwaukee, followed it up with a second speech last week in terms of reaching out to the black community.I think it was the Pew poll, but there was a poll last week that showed he had 14.6 percent of the black vote. Not high, but higher than the last eight Republican presidential candidates.INGRAHAM: Yes!HANNITY: That would be significant.INGRAHAM: That's the polling he's gotten. Yes. I mean, think about it.  He has the entire Hollywood establishment against him, entire media establishment, a lot of the GOP establishment, the Democrats, the power of the bully pulpit of the White House, Hillary and all her minions.And when you look at whether Nate Silver's current prognosis on the Electoral College or the percentage of black vote, he's doing better than Mitt Romney finished.So what does that tell you? This race is over? There's no race here?  There's a viable race. He has an uphill battle, no doubt. But I think he continues to talk about real economic opportunity for people who've been taken for granted and gypped by a political party that has taken advantage of them and that uses them election cycle after election cycle.HANNITY: This is basically...INGRAHAM: If he continues to do that, he'll do well.HANNITY: Last question. This is Hillary trying to gin up the base here.  This is her trying to get her base to rally around this narrative. You said this is used every four years. Is this a way to play the race card that the Democratic Party uses every four years?INGRAHAM: Oh, it's clockwork. I mean, we were just looking at our watches. Well, when is this going to happen? Hillary is up against the wall. What is she going to say, I did a great job in Benghazi, I did a great job in the Middle East? What is her record? She has no record to run on, so she has to say Republicans are racist. Trump is racist, alt- right, all that nonsense that doesn't affect anybody's lives.So this is clockwork, textbook Clinton narrative. And the Democrats's game is so tired. I hope people are onto it.HANNITY: And I hope that people paid attention to what we've been saying here and the stats that we put up. And maybe the media will finally -- maybe they'll do a real history of the Democratic Party and racism.INGRAHAM: Yes, be honest.HANNITY: For the first time. Laura, thank you.INGRAHAM: Thanks.HANNITY: Coming up next tonight on a busy news night here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: So what does she do when she can't defend her record?AUDIENCE: Lie!TRUMP: That's right. She lies!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump went after Hillary at a rally in New Hampshire earlier today. We've got the highlights and get reaction from the one and only Ann Coulter. She's here.And also tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NIGEL FARAGE, BRITISH POLITICIAN: You can go out. You can beat the pollsters. You can beat the commentators! You can beat Washington!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: One of the leaders behind Brexit, Nigel Farage, says that Trump has a good chance of winning in November.That and more tonight on a busy ""Hannity"" straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: So what does she do when she can't defend her record?AUDIENCE: Lie!TRUMP: That's right. She lies! She's a -- she lies! And she smears, and she paints decent Americans -- you -- as racists.(BOOS)TRUMP: She bullies voters who only want a better future.I want you to remember these three words. Shame on you!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Wow. That was Donald Trump, GOP presidential nominee, earlier today preemptively responding to these attacks from Democratic rival -- his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.Joining us now, author of 11 New York Times bestsellers -- I assume this will be number 12 -- ""In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome,"" Ann Coulter.  What's up, Ms. Coulter? How are you?ANN COULTER, AUTHOR, ""IN TRUMP WE TRUST"": (INAUDIBLE)(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: I know. I'm going to get there. I thought that was, ""Shame on you,"" a perfect way to respond.COULTER: It is. What more do you want me to say?HANNITY: What do you make of every four years, we go through this nonsense, Democrats play the race card, every four years.COULTER: It's not even every four years.HANNITY: Every two years.COULTER: It's incessant. And particularly in this case -- I was going -- they had -- Breitbart had a book party for ""In Trump We Trust"" last night.HANNITY: Right.COULTER: And I was on my way there in an Uber car. The Uber driver said, Do you mind if I listen to the news? And the whole thing is -- on, apparently, CNN, I found out, with them all talking about Breitbart being this racist organization. They're all racists, and they're racists?I said, What are you listening to? And then told him -- he was a black cab driver, an Uber driver. And I said, You are taking me to a party at -- at...HANNITY: At Breitbart.COULTER: Right, at this horrible racist...HANNITY: What'd he say?COULTER: Because I'm bursting out laughing at all this, and I invited him to come to the party so he could see all the scary racists there.No, it's because Breitbart put out ""Clinton Cash,"" which has been watched by more than three million people on line. I mean, it's been acknowledged by Washington Post, New York Times as absolutely devastating because it very clearly lays out the whole pay-for-play Clinton Foundation scam, where they take money. Hillary does a favor as secretary of state, and then, oh, weirdly, Bill Clinton gets hired to give a speech for $600,000.I mean, it's just so utterly, obviously corrupt...HANNITY: But the media...COULTER: ... like everything else she does.HANNITY: And the media -- and you know, you actually outlined in one of your earlier books -- and I remember we interviewed you about that. You know, let's play her mentor. This is her mentor, Robert, the former Klansman, Byrd. This is him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ROBERT BYRD (D), WEST VIRGINIA: They're white (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  I've seen a lot of white (EXPLETIVE DELETED) in my time, if you want to use that word. But we've all -- we all -- we just need to work together to make our country a better (INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That's her mentor!COULTER: I'd say Donald Trump's attack is much better and much more devastating, and that is...HANNITY: ""Shame on you.""COULTER: ... the Democrats and Hillary Clinton see African-Americans only as voters. They don't care about -- the Democrats don't care about your lives or your jobs.Immigration and a border wall is the great unifier. Trump promises to put Americans first, to protect their neighborhoods, but most of all, to bring jobs back, to end these job-killing trade deals. He's the first person to ever come along and say, Maybe we should care about just emptying out the manufacturing base of America and to stop dumping low-wage workers on the country. I mean, that is the big issue he has.HANNITY: We have 95 million Americans out of the labor force right now.  One in five American families don't have one person in their family working. So 11 million illegals, more coming every day, competing for fewer jobs...COULTER: Right.HANNITY: ... driving down wages. Who has been disproportionately impacted? What demographic group more than any other?COULTER: Right. Now, I...HANNITY: Black Americans.COULTER: And Carol Swain (ph), a wonderful professor at Vanderbilt, has documented this over and over again. It is African-Americans who are hurt the most by our current immigration policies, which is why I am so annoyed by the plutocrats and the rich and the elites who get their -- you know, their chief nannies and chefs and chauffeurs and strut around like they're Martin Luther King.No. The compassionate policy is to be compassionate toward Americans. And nobody has talked about Americans until Donald Trump came along and didn't need the donors. So he wasn't being bossed around by campaign consultants, though it sounds as if some campaign consultant has slipped into his campaign, and I don't think he should have been hiring, you know, Rubio's speechwriter for his interview with you, giving all these ridiculous talking points for amnesty.And to speak to that, for one thing, the mainstream media -- I've criticized Trump before. I'm not some, you know, Clinton cultist or a Cruz cultist. He's my guy, but I give him constructive criticism. And every time I do this, the media makes this huge big deal of, you know, Coulter tiring of Donald Trump.It was a joke when I said this was going to be the shortest book tour ever.  It's called a joke. But I do think -- because simultaneously with his interview with you, where he said some very dumb things -- oh, well -- he's giving these spectacular speeches. In Fredericksburg, Virginia, in Tampa, Florida, there is completely the opposite. He's going back to saying, I'm going to put Americans first!HANNITY: Actually, I was there. People misinterpreted a lot of what we discussed yesterday. What he did was survey the crowd, and then he kept reinforcing, Enforce the law.COULTER: Well, no, I know.HANNITY: That's what he said again and again and again.COULTER: And he does keep saying he will put Americans first. If he puts Americans first and all that nonsense someone told him to say about, And they'll pay back taxes -- OK, a little pro tip. Back taxes for -- they're not making enough money to pay taxes. Back taxes means we give each illegal alien approximately $30,000 in earned income tax credit refunds.HANNITY: All right, I got another...COULTER: It means we pay them.HANNITY: ... segment. Stay right there.COULTER: It is a lie.HANNITY: I want to ask you when we get back about the Republican establishment's outright sabotage of Trump.COULTER: Yes.HANNITY: and -- because if Trump doesn't get the 90 percent of the base that he should get, they're helping elect Hillary.COULTER: Correct.HANNITY: And I say they own Hillary's Supreme Court decisions. They own Hillary's...COULTER: The country, though...HANNITY: ... unvetted refugees. They...COULTER: The country is (INAUDIBLE) We're at the tipping point. This is a serious election, and it's utterly irresponsible and hateful of these people who, as I describe in chapter three...HANNITY: A bunch of sore loser crybabies, pick up your toys and go home.COULTER: It's existential for them, for the campaign consultants, for the Washington insiders. Trump has proved they are irrelevant. They don't know what they're doing, so they have to stop them to preserve their jobs.  And you know, as I say...HANNITY: All right, we'll come back.COULTER: ... their motto is...HANNITY: More with Ann Coulter, her book, ""In Trust We Trump (sic): E Pluribus Awesome.""COULTER: ""In Trump We Trust.""HANNITY: That's what I said. ""In Trump We Trust."" That's right.Take a break. We'll come back. Also coming up tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NIGEL FARAGE, BRITISH POLITICIAN: And remember, anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: One of the leaders behind the Brexit vote rallied Trump supporters last night and said Trump does have a good chance of winning in November. We'll have more with Ann Coulter.And also later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I know there's a lot of smoke, and there's no fire.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Hillary and Bill Clinton in huge damage control mode after the damning AP report about their foundation and people that were donors buying access -- as a matter of fact, more than half. Peter Schweizer, Monica Crowley, Doug Schoen will weigh in and more as we continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NIGEL FARAGE, BRITISH POLITICIAN: There are millions of ordinary Americans who've been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them.You have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign. You can go out.  You can beat the pollsters. You can beat the commentators. You can beat Washington!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FARAGE: And remember, anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Nigel Farage, one of the leaders who helped push the June Brexit vote, at Donald Trump's rally last night. Trump has said that we'll be calling him Mr. Brexit after November. Is he right?Still with us, author of ""In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome,"" Ann Coulter.All right, so right now, if you look at the number of Republicans, percentage of Republicans that, polling-wise, are voting for Trump, it's about 75 percent. He needs 90 percent. He gets 90 percent, it's 14, 15 percent of the black vote, you know, and a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote, he'll be president. But you have all these former candidates for the presidency...COULTER: Right.HANNITY: ... that made pledges. Then you've got Paul Ryan. And then you've got a bunch of wonks over at The Wall Street Journal, National Review, that I think, you're right, they want the cheap labor for their -- for their, you know, big corporate buddies, are doing everything they can do to sabotage him.They're not thinking about the Supreme Court. They're not thinking about vetting refugees...COULTER: Right.HANNITY: ... immigration. They're not thinking about getting rid of ""Obama care,"" energy independence -- wait a minute...COULTER: It's utterly selfish. And as I was saying, I mean, their motto is, I only regret that I have but one country to give for my TV gig. They don't care about the country.I thought the country -- I kind of thought it might be over when Romney lost. He had the best position on immigration of any president until the dawn of Trump. But I thought there was, you know, a 10 percent chance we could save the country.I wrote, ""Adios America"" and ""God Bless Donald Trump."" He read it. Now we are at the tipping point. It's much farther along -- I mean, Democrats must be thinking, We thought it was going to take 20 years to completely take over the country. The way Obama is flying in Central Americans and bringing in Muslim, refugees, we can get this done, you know, in Hillary's first term.Both Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine say that they will amnesty the roughly 30 to 50, 60 million illegal aliens. Presidential elections are decided by a few million votes. If she does that, if she quadruples, more than quadruples the number of Muslim refugees, it's over. Republicans never win another presidential election, we have nine Ruth Bader Ginsburgs on the Supreme Court.We are done with the essay portion of this election. It is down to the multiple choice. It is Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, and if it's Hillary Clinton, what you do, what I do, what FOX News does -- we'll be irrelevant because there won't be a fight anymore. There absolutely won't be a fight. It's utterly selfishAnd I think in the end -- I mean, I still believe, as I think I was saying on radio -- I'm not some -- I'm not going to be a nut and say I don't believe the polls. But I do think the polls are going to change. I still think Donald Trump is more likely to win than not. I think people will get serious and realize this is it. This is it for the country.HANNITY: But I think it's worse than that. If Hillary wins, I am blaming them directly for their sabotage.COULTER: Oh, yes, I...HANNITY: They own her Supreme Court choices. They own...COULTER: Oh, yes.HANNITY: ... whatever the refugees do to Americans. They own...COULTER: Oh, yes.HANNITY: ... the fact that Americans won't get back to work.COULTER: I don't know what their vision is, apart from my point that it's completely over. Republicans can have no fighting chance anymore. The whole country is California. Let's just say that weren't true. Let's say it were 20 years ago. (INAUDIBLE) think that, you know, the people who voted for Trump are going to come back to the never-Trumpers as our conquering heroes? No. They will have destroyed any chance the Republicans have. That won't really matter anyway.But, you know, as for this idea that even if Trump believed -- and look, I think he made a mistake in the things he said to you. He was using the catch phrase, oh, and I have a glossary here for all the euphemisms for supporting amnesty. Claiming they'll pay back taxes is one of them. No citizenship is another one. These are all the Marco Rubio cliches used to push the gang of eight bill.And even -- look, I don't think that's true. I think it's stupid because all Trump is doing is demoralizing his base. The people who hate him still hate him, but now they can call him a flip-flopper. Way to go, whoever told Trump to say that.But the whole -- I mean not only through this campaign where he's been consistent over and over again in putting Americans first, the one thing, he isn't a politician. He does get some things wrong. The one things that has been totally consistent in his life that I describe in this book is that he has always been super patriotic, has always put Americans first, has always cared about working class Americans. And if you are putting Americans first, you are not going to want to keep even the most law- abiding illegal alien because as I point out again in this book, one illegal alien, the most wonderful law-abiding, been here 15, 20 years with one child in school, that's an average of $12,000 a year. The only taxes they pay are sales taxes. The highest sales tax in the country is about nine percent. An illegal alien would have to spend more than $100,000 a year in taxable -- not sell, buy more than $100,000 a year in taxable goods just to break even on the cost of educating a child, and that's assuming no food stamps, no free school lunches, no English as a second language classes. This is burdening America. We're a generous people, but it's enough already.SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Then why are so many Republicans sabotaging him, Ann? Why?COULTER: A couple of things. One is people are always bitter at the people who beat them. As I pointed out --HANNITY: The same people that forced John McCain and Bob Dole down your throat.COULTER: No, I know. I reluctantly supported Mr. Amnesty, John McCain, with my, I think, very helpful website, Get drunk and vote for McCain.com.  But I came around. I supported Palin.(LAUGHTER)COULTER: I supported the senators and the Congressman.HANNITY: Get drunk and vote for McCain.com.COULTER: Let's say you can't support Trump. How about we'll take care of the turkey, you do the side dishes and the dessert. You take care of the Senate races and the Congressional races. No. They want to viciously, hysterically attack Trump.And part of it is just sour grapes. This is the guy who whooped them. But also the rewards in the media are there for anyone who wants to attack Trump. People I have never heard of, never seen on TV before, and do not exactly have, you know, square-jawed good looks like Rick Wilson, let's get this guy on TV. Suddenly --HANNITY: They're everywhere.COULTER: They had to fire Melissa Harris-Perry to get Rick Wilson his own spot on MSNBC. I mean, suddenly you are being quoted all over. You become a star in today's media culture because all of the elites want to stop Trump. This is up to the people, and it's up to Trump.HANNITY: All right. Ann Coulter, AnnCoulter.com for your book signings.COULTER: We have a book signing this Sunday in New York.HANNITY: You didn't even invite me. Thanks a lot.COULTER: You're invited.HANNITY: Finally. I had to beg for my invitation.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Coming up next tonight on ""Hannity.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT: We're trying to do good things. If there's something wrong with creating jobs and saving lives I don't know what it is.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Clintons desperately trying to defend their foundation amid disturbing new allegations of corruption. Is the race card being played to distract you? We'll check in with Peter Schweizer, Monica Crowley, Doug Schoen.Plus ""The New York post"" has put out a damning new report linking Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin to a radical Muslim magazine, that and her mother.  Why is she so close to Hillary? We'll explain.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We're trying to do good things. If there's something wrong with creating jobs and saving lives I don't know what it is. The people who gave the money knew exactly what they were doing, and I'm really proud.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Bill Clinton yesterday trying to defend the Clinton Foundation after the A.P. released their damning report about pay to play and a possible scheme. Hillary Clinton also dismissed the report. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: My work as secretary of state was not influenced by any outside forces. I made policy decisions based on what I thought was right. I know there's a lot of smoke, and there's no fire.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Oh, really? Here with reaction, author of ""Clinton Cash,"" The New York Times bestseller and movie, Peter Schweizer, Fox News contributor Monica Crowley, former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen.Here's what she said, Doug. It's OK if I take money from Saudi Arabia and these other countries that practice sharia and discriminate against women, kill gays and lesbians and discriminate against Christians and Jews. It's perfectly fine that over half of the people that I gave access to at the State Department are donors and then some went on to benefit because of my actions.DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's the part that hasn't been shown yet.HANNITY: Oh, it actually has been.SCHOEN: When it gets shown, then the secretary of state has a political problem.HANNITY: Peter Schweizer.SCHOEN: She deflected today very successfully --HANNITY: You mean by using the race card?SCHOEN: Absolutely.HANNITY: So she used the race card?SCHOEN: Sean, it's pretty obvious she made race front and center. She used Trump's --HANNITY: Was it the race card?SCHOEN: Sean, she made the issue of race in politics central. Call it what you like.HANNITY: Peter Schweizer, this is your wheelhouse. You own this. You were way ahead of the curve. So this was the worst week for her in terms of all the things you've been telling us coming true. So now we have a situation with Hillary Clinton clearly gave access, pay to play, maybe some would use the word bribery, and got caught. Now --PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR, ""CLINTON CASH"": Exactly.HANNITY: Do you think this was directly connected to her use of this Klan ad that she put out today?SCHWEIZER: Oh, absolutely. No question about it. I mean, it's a classic tactic of the Clintons. If you don't like the conversation, you try to change the conversation.The problem is this issue is not going away. There are more e-mails coming out. I've seen them. They show the same thing. And with all due respect to Doug, I mean, access is the key here. This is a way -- the Clinton Foundation was a way for foreign nationals to influence and get access to the secretary of state. They can't give to her super PAC. They can't give to the campaign. So the Clinton Foundation became the conduit. And that's the reason you have a crown prince or you have a corrupt Nigerian businessman asking the Clinton Foundation to set up meetings in the State Department.HANNITY: How big does this get?SCHWEIZER: What's that?HANNITY: How big will this get? She now has tried to distract and successfully distracted the country today with a Klan ad. What's she going to do tomorrow? What's she going to do for the next 75 days?SCHWEIZER: Yes, I think she's going to have a hard time diverting it.  She's going to try. But, look, when you've got the associated press and the mainstream media are picking up these stories or releasing these e- mails, it's hard to change the conversation. And I just think people are not going to buy it. People know why she's doing this. They know the motivation, and this goes to the central question of how you are going to conduct yourself as president.HANNITY: Monica, let's get your take.SCHWEIZER: Shutting down the Clinton Foundation now is too late.HANNITY: Monica?MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, the Clinton Foundation has always been an ethic hustle. This has essentially been a money laundering operation to enrich the Clintons and also to develop a massive war chest for her 2016 presidential run. In 2013, the Clinton Foundation -- the paperwork was exposed, and what we found was that the foundation took in over $140 million, Sean, and only spent about $9 million on direct aid.  The rest of it went to administrative and travel costs, salaries and bonuses, particularly for Clinton family and friends.The charity navigator website, which is a prestigious charity watchdog took a look at this. They put the Clinton Foundation on their watch list because it was so problematic that they sacked it along with Al Sharpton's National Action Network. The Clinton Foundation has never been audited either by the IRS or by an independent accounting authority. So nobody actually knows what's in there.This is textbook corruption, and every time the Clintons are presented with the evidence from Peter Schweizer or from the associated press, they constantly deflect by saying, well, there's no direct evidence. Sean, most criminal cases are decided on circumstantial evidence, and as Peter Schweizer's work has shown, the A.P.'s work has shown, there are mountains of circumstantial evidence.HANNITY: We've got to take a break here.SCHOEN: Why did Donald Trump give $100,000 and say it was good work?HANNITY: We've got to take a break. We'll come back. More with our panel right after this.And also ""The New York Post"" put out a damning new report that links Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, to an extremely radical Muslim journal, including Huma's mother. And wait till you hear what Hillary said in Saudi Arabia about their treatment of women and how wrong she is, straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" A shocking report from The New York Post is alleging that long time Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin sent 10 years as an editor for the ""Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs,"" which the post describes as, quote, ""a radical Muslim publication that is opposed to women's rights and blamed the U.S. for 9/11.""A Clinton campaign spokesperson is pushing back against the report, telling ""The Post"" that, quote, ""her name was simply listed on the mast head in that period and that she did not play a role in editing that publication.""Back with us, Peter Schweizer, Monica Crowley, Doug Schoen. Wait a minute.  But it was her mother and her brother and her sister, Peter, that were a part of this group. The mother wrote this, you know, 31-page screed about how women are not mistreated in Saudi Arabia, and Hillary and the mother appeared together in Saudi Arabia, and Hillary said, oh, we've got to debunk the myth that women are treated poorly in Saudi Arabia, where they can't drive, can't leave the country on their own, and are told how to dress and whether they can go to school or work.SCHWEIZER: Yes, this is a huge problem, Sean. I mean, you can't just walk away and say, well, my name was on the mast head but I had no connection to it, especially when this was basically a family enterprise. Look, Huma Abedin is at the central core of the Clinton apparatus. When she was Hillary's right hand at the State Department, she was also she was on the payroll of the Clinton Foundation. She was also put on the payroll of --HANNITY: She had three separate jobs, three checks coming in.  SCHOEN: That is, to me, where the problem is. You go at the issues of obvious conflict of interest rather than guilt by association, because that is the problematic --HANNITY: Her name was on a radical Islamic publication.SCHOEN: Sean, it's disgusting. How much more clear can I be?HANNITY: Is it disgusting that Hillary took money from the Saudis that abused women, gays, lesbians, Christians and Jews? Is that disgusting.SCHOEN: Can I finish?HANNITY: Is that disgusting.SCHOEN: No. Because we need Saudis to be a bulwark against Iran in the Middle East.HANNITY: We're taking their blood money, Monica Crowley.SCHOEN: It's not blood money.HANNITY: It's blood money. You kill gays and lesbians, that's not blood money?SCHOEN: Sean, our policies are abhorrent, they're keeping the world balanced because we have no Middle East policy.HANNITY: Monica, I wouldn't take a penny.CROWLEY: There are two really big points about Huma Abedin and this Institute for Muslim minority affairs and the journal she was on the masthead of. One, ""Muslim Minority Affairs"" does not refer to getting social welfare programs for Muslims who happen to be minorities, no. What it's about is preparing the Muslim minority to be the Muslim minority in places like the west and the United States.Number two, and this is really important because she referred to her family, her parents, along with the major Al Qaeda financier named Omar Naseef began this institute as a Saudi regime initiative, Sean. This was funded by the Saudi regime in order to spread Islam and sharia across the west, including in the United States. This is Huma Abedin's life's work.  This is what her parents do. They're essentially tools of the Saudi regime in order to make this transition globally. So this is not an innocent journal. She runs around saying I didn't have anything to do with it.  This is her life's work, Sean.HANNITY: Peter?SCHWEIZER: I think Monica makes a great point. And look, to the larger issue, the Saudis have given $25 million to the Clinton Foundation. They and others in the Middle East have paid very lucrative speeches for Bill Clinton. The question everybody has to ask is, are they not expecting something in return? Are they not expecting access? Are they not expecting favorable treatment? Of course they are. This is how money and politics work. They recognize that.HANNITY: Peter, hold that thought. They are expecting something for that money, aren't they?  SCHOEN: I hope they get a stronger U.S.-Saudi alliance against radical Shiites.HANNITY: When the crown prince of Bahrain calls the Clinton Foundation and says ""I need to see Hillary"" and the Clinton Foundation gets in touch with the secretary of state and he gets his meeting in 48 hours, that is buying influence, isn't it? That's pay to play.SCHOEN: And I want to know, what did they get for that money?HANNITY: One guy got forestry rights in Columbia.SCHOEN: Look. The Clinton's stance all becomes a mishmash, smoke, no fire.CROWLEY: Sean, can I just jump in quickly? Because Peter has done great work on the access, and that is the problem. I think the big story here is through Huma Abedin that the access was granted to some of the world's greatest villains, Sean, including sub-Saharan dictators and the Saudi regime and others.HANNITY: Exactly. I think by the time this election is said and done, America will know all about it. Doug, good to see you. Monica, Peter, thank you.SCHOEN: Thank you.HANNITY: Coming up, a very important question of the day, we need your help, that is next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Time for our ""Question of the Day."" Do you think the Clinton Foundation should be shut down? And do you also think that this is a distraction, Hillary's comments today, to cover up of course the pay to play? Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you thinkThat is all the time we have left this evening. As always, thank you for being with us.
