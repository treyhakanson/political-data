This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, all-out chaos at the Democratic National Convention as yet another e-mail scandal hits the Clinton campaign, leads the Democrats to ditch their party chair and  prompts a series of angry protests, including right on the convention floor.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly reporting on night one of the Democratic National Convention here in Philadelphia. This was supposed to be Hillary Clinton's big week. Instead, it has so far been overshadowed by reports of leaked Democratic Party e-mails that appear to show officials plotting against the Bernie Sanders campaign. And Sanders' supporters are no happy about it.Tonight they will hear directly from Senator Sanders here in Philadelphia, and we will also hear from the First Lady, Michelle Obama. But first to the anger that is boiling over. Protesters have taken to the streets of Philadelphia to voice their outrage, even borrowing a line you may have heard at the Republican convention.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CROWD CHANTING)""LOCK HER UP""! ""LOCK HER UP""! ""LOCK HER UP""! ""LOCK HER UP""! ""LOCK HER UP""!(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Chants of ""lock her up"", ""lock her up"" from Democrats. And then there's this message.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CROWD CHANTING)""Hell, no, DNC. We won't vote for Hillary."" ""Hell, no, DNC. We won't vote for Hillary."" ""Hell, no, DNC. We won't vote for Hillary."" ""Hell, no, DNC. We won't vote for Hillary.""(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: So, it was just a week ago that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is now about to step down as chair of the DNC because of this scandal, was mocking the Republicans for not being united. It was one week ago.  Taunting Reince Priebus. So if Democrats did not get the message outside the convention hall today, they sure it did get it inside when the delegates interrupted the start of the convention. Watch.(CROWD CHANTING)KELLY: It's been a raucous day. We've got it all covered for you with Shannon Bream on the floor.And Trace Gallagher with the details of how this all started. We go first to Trace. Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, the leaked e-mails run from January 2015 through May of this year. The most damaging ones are from later in the primary season when Hillary Clinton had a sizeable lead.  Still, the e-mails appear to fly in the face of the Democratic National Committee's obligation to remain neutral. For example, ahead of the Kentucky and West Virginia primaries, DNC officials apparently tried to use Bernie Sanders' religion against him. Sanders is Jewish but says he's not religious.So in one e-mail, the DNC chief financial officer wrote, quoting, ""I think I read he is an atheist."" This could make several points' difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist. In response, the CEO of the DNC writes, quote, ""amen.""  On May 21st, the DNC national press secretary suggested pushing the narrative that Sanders, quote, ""Never, ever had his act together."" That his campaign was a mess, going on to say, quote, ""It's not a DNC conspiracy. It's because they never had their act together."" And when Bernie Sanders complained that the party hadn't been fair to him, Debbie Wasserman Schultz herself wrote to her colleagues, quote, ""spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do.""Sanders, of course, caucused with the Democrats but had long been an independent. The Sanders campaign was also critical of the DNC for scheduling only six debates, pointing out that in 2008, the Democrats held 25 debates. Sanders argued that fewer debates favored the front-runner.  And as for accusations that Wasserman Schultz was in the tank for Hillary, the former DNC chair said, quote, ""If I wanted to favor a candidate, I would not be DNC chair.""And finally, karma in politics apparently moves quickly. Last week Wasserman Schultz took a swipe at her RNC counterpart Reince Priebus, tweeting, hey, Reince, I'm in Cleveland if you need another chair to help keep your convention in order -- Megyn.KELLY: Oh, Debbie. Trace, thank you. Well, inside this arena, Bernie supporters have battled with Hillary fans for several hours now, and we're waiting to see what happens when the Vermont senator takes to the floor not long from now.For more on that, we go to Shannon Bream on the convention floor. Hi, Shannon.SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Megyn. Well, I've got Jose here with me, he is a navy veteran. He is an ardent Bernie supporter. And he's feeling a little burned these days, not in a good way. Let's talk about the e-mails. Your reaction, how you feel like the party has treated you as a supporter.JOSE, NAVY VETERAN: Right. Well, with the e-mails, I'd like to say it's kind of a thumb print on the scale, and what I mean by that is the Bernie people have had a thought, and even Bernie felt that the DNC has been pushing a lot toward Hillary's favor and not giving a fair shot to the people. So with the e-mails, it's the direct evidence that they were putting their thumb on the scale in favor of Hillary Clinton. So that created a really strange environment for us to all come into. So that's kind of where everybody started, you know, getting angry at that point.BREAM: Yes, and you guys not happy about the V.P. pick. You're not happy about some of the platform. Do you feel like the Clinton campaign is listening to you? Do you have a voice? How do you feel they've treated you coming into this convention?JOSE: Right. I hope for more, a lot more. I think one thing that has been completely wrong with the whole entire thing is the fact that they -- they're not listening -- reaching out to us. We want somebody to be excited about a liberal, progressive -- you know, maybe an Elizabeth Warren pick, maybe even Al Franken pick or possibly even Bernie himself, which is an unbeatable ticket. And then on top of that, they have been the entire convention going Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary is going to be our nominee, and they haven't given us the acknowledgement that we're actually fighting for Bernie and what we've done for Bernie.  BREAM: And they've been very vocal here on the floor. We expect more of that tonight. Megyn, back to you.KELLY: Shannon, thank you.Joining us now with more, Tezlyn Figaro, a former Bernie Sanders campaign staffer and she's founder of the Tezlyn Figaro Communications Group.  Austan Goolsbee is here. He's previously the President Obama's chief economist and is an economist professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. And Nomiki Konst, she's a Bernie Sanders supporter and founder of The Accountability Project. Great to see you all.TEZLYN FIGARO, FORMER BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN STAFFER: Thank you.NOMIKI KONST, FOUNDER, THE ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT: Nice to see you.KELLY: Unbelievable, right?KONST: Yes.KELLY: I mean, it's really unbelievable. When you look at these e-mails, they clearly show that the DNC was working to elect her over Bernie.  There's no question they had their thumb on the scale. They talk about him very negatively. And in particular, the knock on his faith. They conspired -- they appeared to conspire to raise his faith against him, and the response is amen like, yes, let's do it. Tezlyn, let me start with you. Your thoughts about it?FIGARO: Well, you know, to be honest with you, I've seen this throughout the entire Democratic Party. It's not just the DNC, the leadership there.  I've seen it across the state of Florida on every campaign that I've worked. It's been a constant rhetoric about how Republicans are racist, how Republicans are the big, bad, evil ones. But what I have consistently seen throughout the Democratic Party -- and we have the results and the numbers to back it up -- that there has been constant racism within the party.There's been constant gender issues within the party. And as we can see, even comments against religion. So, I'm excited to see that the party has been exposed for what it is. Trump called Bernie crazy Bernie for saying that it was a conspiracy, that it was rigged, and we see that it was. And I'm hoping Senator Sanders pulls the support.KELLY: Uh-hm.What about Debbie Wasserman Schultz who, you know, ripped into the Republicans for, you know, all sorts of things, including misogyny. She's been all over Trump for misogyny. There's a memo from her vice chair calling a very well-known news anchor a bimbo. Is there a response from her saying, we don't talk like that? That's not appropriate? Not that we've seen. The hypocrisy in these e-mails, Nomiki, really paints an ugly picture.KONST: I'm a Democrat. I believe in the Democratic Party. I think that the past ten years we've had the wrong leadership in the Democratic Party.  I think it started with Tim Kaine quite frankly when he came in and he took us apart from that 50 state strategy and wanted to encourage leaders across the country to run and to build their parties up, and he took it to a fund- raising factory. And then it continued on with Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  This is a clear cultural problem. There needs to be a cleanup of our party. We saw it in the e-mails. We see it on our leadership.The CEO should be fired and the way that they're treating the Bernie Sanders delegation, I mean, delegate down there. You know, they're telling us to put our signs down. They're telling us to unify. But what I would like to see is we're 46 percent of this party now. We have taken over the party in many states. We are Democrats. We're liberals. We're disaffected voters. We're union members. We're independents. We're new voters. We're young people. We are the future of this party and they need to come to us and say --KELLY: The way to shut up. The way to shut up.KONST: What we can do to teach you.KELLY: Austan, today there was a remarkable moment where Bernie was speaking to his constituents. Bernie Sanders, and he mentions the name of the nominee, Hillary Clinton. Watch what happened. Let's play it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT.: We have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine.(CROWD BOOING)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: The booing went on for over 20 seconds. You know, given the fun that the Democrats had at the Republicans expense last week about a party not unified --AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO'S BOOTH SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: I'm sure everyone -- and I was there. We've talked. I was having a great time at the Republican convention. We're all kind of eating a little humble crow. It's true we had a raucous and long primary. The Sanders people are close to, you know, 46 percent or something of the delegates. I think it's a little different than in the Republican Party where you had the number-two candidate basically condemning the nominee from the floor. You had the number-three candidate --KELLY: He said vote your conscience. Bernie is expected to say vote for Hillary.GOOLSBEE: The number-three candidate, John Kasich, would not even show up at the convention. So I think it is a testament to the Sanders people they're here. The Democrats have always been a little raucous. We like some protests. It's always going to be some cheering, some booing. I think the most unifying thing to the Democratic Party is that Donald Trump opens his mouth.KELLY: Tezlyn, what do you think?FIGARO: I disagree. I think that it's weak. I think people are folding like a napkin. What is the point of having a revolution if there's no consequences? If I was Senator Sanders, I would ask my delegates to leave the floor.KONST: I don't think. I have to disagree with you on this.FIGARO: Yes. But I'm an independent. I'm not a Democrat. I think that there's no consequence. If people continue to fall in line and sing Negro spirituals, like they were doing this. So, even though never be a consequential. Never be respected. If you do not show that you cannot toy with me, as Donald Trump said earlier this year.KELLY: What about Nomiki, because they booed everyone who mentioned Hillary. There were some tweets out today saying, maybe they should think about not mentioning her. You know, because --(CROSSTALK)She's got booed. Even the chaplain who said her name in the prayer got booed.GOOLSBEE: In fairness, that was early in the day. Here this evening, it hasn't really been --KONST: The reason why as a delegate.(CROSSTALK)I got to tell you. I've been walking around. People are tuning out the speeches. I have talked to multiple delegates who feel very disheartened by this process. They're not being included in their own delegation. They are being treated like outsiders. I think a very strong -- I'm sort of in between both of you here. I think a very strong message needs to be sent to the party that they need to respect these delegates and give them --  (CROSSTALK)KELLY: But how --KONST: I'll tell you what. I'll tell you how.(CROSSTALK)I'll tell you how. Whoever is the chair needs to be working -- and the Hillary Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook needs to give us more. They have nothing --KELLY: All right. I got to leave it at that. But final thought, Al Franken last week called the Republicans -- he said it sounded like, what was it, a Banana Republic chant, lock her up, lock her up, and yet what did we hear right here at his own party's convention tonight? Same chant. Oh, it's totally different. It's totally different.(CROSSTALK)It's totally Democrat.GOOLSBEE: What those guys were saying at the Republican convention, you cannot -- the outside protesters, you cannot repeat on TV.KELLY: What the Democrats were saying here is, hell no to Hillary Clinton.  That's our nominee. No, but there are other chances. I understand. Ten minutes late at night but it's not that late, so you just got to Google it.  Great to see you all.FIGARO: Thank you.KELLY: Again, we are waiting to see what happens when former Democratic candidate Senator Bernie Sanders takes to the stage. Plus, we'll bring you the story of the Democratic congressman who today attacked Jewish settlers as termites. And then we will drill deeper on suggestions that the Russians leaked these DNC emails right on the eve of this convention in the interest of creating campaign chaos and perhaps helping Trump. Really?THE KELLY FILE is back in moments. Don't go away.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRIAN FALLON, PRESS SECRETARY, HILLARY CLINTON FOR AMERICA: There's a lot of signals suggesting definitely that the Russians were behind the hack. I mean that has been attested to by experts including top officials from the FBI who ran the initial review of the DNC systems and concluded that it was indeed the Russians.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back to night one of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center. We are waiting for former candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to address this crowd in just a short time.  Senator Sanders' speech comes after a weekend in which leaked DNC emails seemed to show the party working to make sure Hillary Clinton would be the nominee. We'll bring you the Sanders' speech live when it happens this evening.Also awaiting the First Lady, Michelle Obama. But in the meantime, there is some breaking news tonight on who may have been behind the hack of those DNC e-mails. And folks are putting the blame now on the Russians.Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge is live tonight in Washington. Catherine?CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, tonight FOX News has learned the hackers left behind a trail of evidence on the DNC servers including malicious code to steal e-mail and documents.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOB GOURLEY, CYBER SECURITY EXPERT, COGNITIO: The forensic evidence points pretty clearly to a very sophisticated nation state. This is a well- resourced adversary. Specifically they're using the same tools and techniques previously associated with Russia. So the patterns, the tools, the actual work that the bad guys are doing in the networks all is similar to previous Russian intrusion sets.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: Cyber security investigators believe two Russian intelligence agencies infiltrated the DNC using e-mails and opposition research on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump before getting kicked off the networks. And the evidence suggests the same hackers were behind the 2015 cyber operations against the White House State Department and the Pentagon.Today an FBI spokesperson confirmed an investigation into the DNC hack, that a compromise of this scale is something they take seriously and that the FBI wants to identify those responsible, which can be very difficult in these cases. With the hackers linked to Russia, the State Department's spokesman was pressed today on whether the Moscow (ph) is trying to influence the election.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: I think we need to let the FBI do their work before we try to form any conclusions here about what happened and what the motivation was behind it. The FBI has spoken to this. We're going to respect that process.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: At this point there is no forensic link between Wikileaks and the DNC hackers, but the timing does suggest a political motivation -- Megyn.KELLY: Catherine, thank you.HERRIDGE: You're welcome.KELLY: Joining me now, Karl Rove, a former deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush. And Antonio Villaraigosa, former chairman of the DNC. Great to see you both.ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA, FORMER MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES: Great to be here.KELLY: And former L.A. mayor. Okay. First let me start with you as a Democrat about whether you believe this story that the Russians may have not only done this hacking but released it on the eve of the DNC to embarrass the Democrats and help Trump.VILLARAIGOSA: Well, the timing is certainly suspect, and I don't work for the FBI or the State Department, so I certainly can't opine on that. But I can say everything points to the Russians, and the question you have to ask, when we know that there's a mutual admiration society between Putin and Trump is why would they do it?KELLY: What do you think, Karl?KARL ROVE, FORMER DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: I think this -- I agree with Admiral Kirby of the State Department. Leave it up to the FBI. I think the Democrats have seized upon these rumors that the Russians are behind it to draw attention away from the embarrassing nature of these e-mails. We had this chief financial officer of the Democratic National Committee saying, let's appeal to racial, to religious bigotry. Let's suggest he doesn't believe in God because he's a Jew because that will help us with Kentucky and West Virginia and West Virginia primaries for Hillary Clinton.And notice last night on ""60 Minutes,"" Hillary Clinton is asked about this, and she never says, you know what, I condemn what I heard in those. She doesn't say a single word about, you know, Ayers, the chief financial officer telling the CEO, let's talk about how he's a Jew and suggest that he doesn't believe in God.KELLY: (INAUDIBLE)VILLARAIGOSA: First of all, let me condemn those e-mails and anybody who would inject that kind of bigotry into --KELLY: And the DNC has done that now as well.VILLARAIGOSA: Well, there's no question that the people behind those e- mails shouldn't be working at the DNC.KELLY: She should just come out and say -- completely condemn. Completely inappropriate.VILLARAIGOSA: Well, I've been here, so I'm not sure. I don't know whether or not she has. I know I will. And I think she will as well. First of all, there's no connection between her campaign and the DNC. There are no e-mails connecting --ROVE: Baloney. Baloney.  VILLARAIGOSA: So I will say this. Let me finish. From my vantage point, we've got to condemn those e-mails clearly. We're not trying to move the attention away from those e-mails. It's the State Department -- or the FBI that mentioned the connection between the Russians.KELLY: Right.VILLARAIGOSA: And very clearly Hillary Clinton did not work for the DNC and did not send those e-mails.KELLY: Right, but she wants to be the leader of the country and is obviously the top Democrat right now in the country. And, you know, our last guest, who is a Bernie sanders supporter, Tezlyn, Karl, was talking about how the Democrats have spun this narrative that the Republicans are racist, that the Republicans are misogynist, that the Republicans are the ones who bait about religion. I'm listening down below as Sarah Silverman, the comedian, Al Franken engage with the audience. Let's take a quick listen.AL FRANKEN, ACTOR/COMEDIAN: You know, we have -- we have been -- I want to thank you because Sarah and I have been asked to stretch because we are about to introduce someone that we're both huge fans of. How are we doing, guys? Are we close? We'll see. You know, Sarah, what I love about us both being here is that, you know --KELLY: This is what you have to do when you're in television. You have to learn how to fill empty space. They're waiting for Paul Simon and they're having technical difficulties. It happened at the Republican National Convention too. Karl, go ahead.ROVE: I just want to make the point of, look, Hillary Clinton said she didn't know about these emails. And I know she didn't know about the individual e-mails. But she knew about the woman who was in charge of the institution, who was working actively on her behalf against Bernie Sanders.  And how did she reward her after all of this comes out and after all of this -- she makes her honorary chairman of her fall campaign. That's how she is going to reprimand Debbie Wasserman Schultz is by making her the honorary chairman of her national campaign. I think that's reprehensible.  If she deserved to be removed as DNC chairman, she shouldn't have been rewarded by putting her atop the Hillary for president campaign.VILLARAIGOSA: Well, I think Trump is reprehensible. I think he's neither a conservative or a Republican. I think he's a hater in chief. So we can debate this all night. I'll tell you something, from my vantage point, what we need to understand is that Hillary Clinton has a proven record of fighting for civil rights, of standing up for immigrants and blacks and the poor. And so leave it at that.KELLY: I got to leave it at that because a lovely moment is happening down below. I think this song was meant to be a jab at the Republicans, but many are saying it's not the right choice given what we saw today in the Democrat Party.  About a ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters.""Gentlemen, thank you both so much.VILLARAIGOSA: Thank you.KELLY: Let's take a little bit of a listen here to Paul Simon as we await Bernie Sanders. First Lady Michelle Obama. And up next after this break, more polls out today showing Donald Trump pulling into the lead ahead of Hillary Clinton. Stay with us.  (PAUL SIMON SINGING ""BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER"")(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new polls out today suggest a post-convention Trump bump for the GOP. In a new CBS survey, Trump is up two points, but so is Hillary Clinton, keeping the two candidates neck and neck in that poll. But look at this from CNN. Trump surges as Hillary Clinton slides.  That means tonight Trump's brand-new polling average shows him now in the lead by just 0.2 percentage points. The first time though in two months that Trump has pulled ahead of Clinton in the averages.Joining me now co-founder and publisher of the best website online, RealClearPolitics.com, the website that creates the polling average. And one that you really should be reading every day. Tom Bevan is with me now.  And I say that not because you're sitting here but because I tell everyone who --TOM BEVAN, PUBLISHER, REALCLEARPOLITICS: I'm actually heard it when you say it before, Erin. And thank you very much.KELLY: RealClearPolitics.com. Everything you need to know.BEVAN: Thank you.KELLY: So what do you make of this? The bump is real?BEVAN: Sure. I mean certainly in the CNN poll, it was -- you know, Trump was up six, and Clinton was down four, a net ten-point swing.KELLY: Is that a good poll?BEVAN: Yes, it's a quality, credible poll from a major, you know, media outlet, so it's one that we take seriously. And it did show, it showed him gaining with independents. Big swing in his --KELLY: That's where he really made up the numbers.BEVAN: Well, he made a lot. But it also showed across the board Republicans liked what they saw at the convention. They had a better opinion of Trump. The party was more unified at the end of that convention than before. So, I think for all of those reasons, that's why we saw Trump move ahead.KELLY: So, how if at all does this change your analysis of the election at this point? I mean how do you -- because everybody wants to know. So, what does that mean? Who's going to win?BEVAN: Right. Right. And look, this is a crucial part of the campaign, but we are kind of -- now we were in halftime just, you know, a day or two ago. And now with the Democrats starting, we'll have to wait and see what happens here and see, you know, after the dust settles, when those next polls come out --KELLY: But he did what he needed to do is what you're saying.BEVAN: Absolutely.KELLY: He got it done last night.BEVAN: Absolutely.KELLY: And now can she make up the difference because she in that CNN poll was seven points ahead of him one week ago. Now he's three points ahead of her.BEVAN: Correct. And it's going to be fascinating. She needs to do exactly what he did, which is again this four-day period, to unify her party, and this is what's going on and right now and it's going to be going on over the next few days. Will Democrats like what they see in Hillary Clinton? Will they come out of this more unified, have a better, higher opinion of her? And then also, can she win back Independents? And that's going to be, you know, crucial.  KELLY: She lost them in a week? I mean this huge poll percentage over to him just because of the four days we saw in Cleveland?BEVAN: That's what that one poll is showing. And again, I always say to people not to put too much docket (ph) in one poll. But that's what that poll showed. And again, Trump had been leading independents throughout most of this campaign.KELLY: Yeah, right.BEVAN: Although it's been close. They've been fairly (inaudible) but he said he had an advantage there.KELLY: Tom, great to see you.BEVAN: You bet. Thanks.KELLY: Joining me now with more, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor and Dana Perino who's co-host of ""The Five"" and former White House press secretary under George W. Bush. Great to see you both.DANA PERINO, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: Thank you.KELLY: So, what do you make of it, Stirewalt, the numbers, the shift?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: There's a bump. These are two polls that are good or, as Tom said, they meet the USDA requirements for polling nutritive value.KELLY: I got to say, you both sound a little underwhelmed, with all due respect to our friends at CNN, you're both -- you're like.STIREWALT: It's a weekend poll. You can't poll people on the weekend.KELLY: You know, it's a good-looking poll.STIREWALT: The poll has a great personality. It's a data point. It's what we've got to work with right now. What we're really going to be looking at, we're really not going to know anything until next week because we got to clear out all this noise about Trump's up and then Hillary is going to get a bounce. It's just predictable.Traditionally Republicans are going to get a four or a four and a half point bounce out of the convention. Democrats differ because they're crazy. They do different stuff in different years. They're much more emotional in their response to their campaigns and their candidates. So, who knows?PERINO: But I think that last week, one of the things the Donald Trump's campaign did very well in setting up the convention is it's one thing that you're showcasing your candidate, but you're also defining your opponent. And early on, those first three days, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, before he gave his big speech on Thursday night, there was a concerted effort to define her as crooked, and remember that lock her up chant, I think that that really stuck like glue.So, from a convention standpoint on the Republican side, they definitely did the job that they need to do for Donald trump. And then he topped it off with a speech that apparently a lot of Republicans seemed to like.KELLY: Nobody is remembering the Melania incident. I mean, like they're remembering that Chris Christie speech which was, you know, it sticks in your head because there was a chant and he had people, you know, repeating. The thing here, Stirewalt, we're already seeing it. It's snazzy. It's more dazzling.STIREWALT: Yeah.KELLY: The democrats have a bunch of celebrities in their party. They wow you. Here we go with Eva Longoria who said some very unfortunate things about the Romneys, but then she claims her twitter account has been hacked.PERINO: By the Russians? Right.KELLY: But, you'll never know that happens -- that happens.PERINO: I've heard of that.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: The FBI should look into that.KELLY: So what does effect does that have on gen pop if you will, you know, the people out there that are watching this?STIREWALT: OK, the point of conventions is to finish the primary. The point of the convention is to say to all the Republicans, OK, we're done. and this is -- we're together now. And then all the Democrats say, OK, we're together. It's not really the beginning of the general election. It's the end of the primaries.But can we come together? We're going to come together here and there, we're going to leave here and we're going to go. And you heard Al Franken before he was talking about its 103 days and we're done here, and what we do in this room, what we go out and do, puts (ph) to imbue these people with purpose, and their purpose in every video, every bumper, every other - - everything that they talk about is that Donald Trump is wicked. He's not just we disagree with him.It's that he is a bad and iniquitous man. And they want all these Democrats go running out of here with the same message. And I bet by the time they get done doing four days of it, they'll be there.KELLY: He said to the crowd, I'm sure you all of you have lovely families. Ignore them. I'm asking you to ignore them in the next 100 days so you can go and get me for her.PERINO: The other thing for Hillary Clinton is that she's going to be buoyed by all of these great speakers that they have lined up from Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, Senator Warren, even Senator Bernie Sanders is going to, you know, he'll give a nod to his people that he's going to say vote for her. But can it change the fact that in one of those polls she was at 68 percent untrustworthy.I mean, how can you in four days turn that around? I think that's very difficult. But only she can pull herself across the finish line. All these other people can help get her there but she has to be the one to pull it across.KELLY: I think there's going to be a lot of testimonials. We didn't see that many testimonials other than Donald Trump's children last week about what a good man Donald Trump is. It was more how the country needs Donald Trump and Hillary is bad. What we're going to be told is that there's going be character witnesses...STIREWALT: You're right.KELY: ...to rehabilitate Hillary's image in the eyes of the American people.STIREWALT: And who's the most important one?KELLY: Bill?STIREWALT: Barack Obama.KELLY: Oh?STIREWALT: Oh now, Bill got to say what he's got to say. Bill ran out of tether in about 1996. But Barack Obama and he's vouching for Hillary Clinton.KELLY: And how about Michelle Obama tonight?STIREWALT: All huge. So, giving -- handing over the brand, handing over the torch. We fought. We hated each other. It was horrible, but you know what? We -- we came to trust her. We came to believe in her. And the fact that the president is more popular now than he has been in three or four years will help Hillary Clinton a lot to carry out...KELLY: How smart is it to put Michelle Obama on the same night as Bernie Sanders? A unifying force as great as a one as there is in the Democratic Party up next...PERINO: Look, I think that if you're -- the Democrats should think, well, the best thing to do is Bernie Sanders to be in that Monday spot so that he's not crowding out the news cycle on Thursday. And I also think Michelle Obama, she is loved in this room, and so there's going to be good emotions and good vibrations so to speak. (Inaudible).KELLY: Let's take a quick listen to the former star of ""Desperate Housewives,"" Eva Longoria as she introduces Cory Booker.(SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J. SPEECH)KELLY: New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who is said to be on the short list for the vice presidential spot on the Democratic ticket, who once saved a woman from a burning building, and is a rising star in the Democrat Party. You saw him tonight talking about how individualism didn't get us to the moon, and praising the value of love before he went on to attack Donald Trump for not showing any in his view.Ripping Trump on his bankruptcies and his comments about women and his comments about John McCain and his proposed Muslim ban and on and on it went. Joining me now for a quick, Sheriff David Clarke, who is the Milwaukee County Sheriff. Sheriff, great to see you, what did you think of Senator Booker's remarks?DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF: What's he so angry about? I mean when Donald Trump uses that kind of passion, they say he's angry, but the only thing he didn't use was a car in every driveway and a chicken in every pot (inaudible) he talked all around a big problem for the Democrats is his fall, and that is their flawed candidate, Mrs. Bill Clinton, who should have been under criminal indictment. She's a confirmed liar. She left people to die in Benghazi.All that kind of stuff that he just kind of like, you know, acted like it wasn't there. But that stuff matters to the American people. So, you know, this thing will go on just like the RNC. They'll get their pom poms out, and you rah, rah and what not, but the stark contrast I think with the Republicans, Donald Trump is the law and order candidate, and this DNC seems to be about embracing criminality and criminal behavior, trying to mainstream criminal behavior, hold these individuals up as if they're martyrs and symbols of the new civil rights movement.KELLY: Let's just talk about -- let's just frame that for the viewers so they know what you're talking about. So tomorrow night onstage here, the mother of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old who was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, among other mothers of African-American men who were killed at the hands of police officers, will take to the stage.Michael Brown's mother is the most controversial however, because her son was the aggressor against the police officer. And while he lost his life, the DOJ concluded it was because of his own actions in attacking a cop. Go ahead.CLARKE: Well, I think they all -- if you look at a common denominator among most of those there, they were resisting arrest. Eric Garner was resisting arrest. Freddie Gray was resisting arrest. Michael Brown attacked a law enforcement officer and tried to disarm him. Another one, a guy from Milwaukee, Hamilton was beating a Milwaukee police officer with his night stick when the officer had no other choice but to use deadly force to save his own life.KELLY: Right.CLARKE: Look, moms are going to do what moms do. Moms love their kids no matter what. We all get that. But here's the question I have, Megyn, and I keep asking. Where are the dads? When there are no fathers around to shape the behavior of young boys growing up, they grow up to be unmanageable misfits that the police then have to deal with aggressively.KELLY: Sheriff Clarke, always good to get your perspective as somebody who is actually on the street, saving lives and protecting a community. Thank you, sir. We'll see you soon.CLARKE: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: So tomorrow night we have a huge night. That's day two of our ""Kelly File"" live from the DNC in Philly. But tonight, what a night ahead. The first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will take to the stage right behind me, and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders will as well. What's going to happen when Senator Sanders goes out there? What are his supporters going to do when he says Hillary Clinton? Boo her right here in this auditorium? Let me know your thoughts. Facebook.com/thekellyfile and on Twitter @megynkelly, and stay tuned because Bret and I have much, much more.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.Can 'Pay for Play' Access Be Eliminated in Washington?John Layfield: Different term lengths for Congress, term lengths, election process and greater transparency. The problem here is massive. As of June, 12,553 lobbyists were registered in Washington, D.C. When you add in the staff with those it's an estimated 90,000 people are associated with those lobbyists, 167 people per Congress member and it's about $5 million because $2.6 billion is spent on congress lobbying. All for special interests. You can stop this, but you need an overhaul of the system. Look, there's not much doubt that she did, but everybody is doing it.Cathy Taylor: I served in the White House and I can tell you that the rules on the government side of this are crystal clear. Getting money from a lobbyist does not mean you engage in pay to play. Make that distinction. The problem is that the Clinton Foundation is a Ponzi scheme, on the foundation side where the laws are murky and Clintons know that and taking advantage of it. You didn't have these issues come up during the Reagan and Burk administrations.Nomi Konst: Right. I mean, again, no surprise. Both sides do this. The Clintons are the masters, the masters back to 1991, when Bill Clinton decided to take a million dollars from a Singaporean billionaire and that basically set the stage for his genius ability to maneuver the billionaire's world. And they know how to use power and use power in other people's favor, to their favor. That's something they've done from the local level at local municipalities and democratic officials all wait to the international level whether it was Sidney Blumenthal walking around Libya, which you need more clearance than God to get into Libya and he's looking for business. This is a problem on both sides but the Clintons really know how.Gary B. Smith: I don't think there's anything to do about it. I like John's suggestions, but unfortunately, you have the fox guarding the hen house here. Only one that's going to change the rules on term limits are the -- are congress and they're not going to do that. Why? Because when you're a politician, you're not in it for the money. I think maybe, you know, after you get out, oh, the Clintons' income when they left $10 million, they've gone a long way from being poor. But while you're a politician what you love most is power and the only way to get that power and keep that power is to keep being re-elected and the only way to keep being re-elected is to service these private interest groups. The big money. You don't think that Donald Trump has serviced private interest in the real estate game. We all say it's like politics. You have to grease one hand, pat the other guy on the back, take money, get things done. I'm sure he's going to do that once he gets elected. That makes sense because Donald Trump wants to stay in power just like Hillary Clinton wants to stay in power. You can't change the rules. We just have to live with it. If there's a way to change, I'm open to it. I think its human nature we're trying to battle in the case.Jonas Max Ferris: Hillary is high on the list because people are smartly betting on her to be the most likely to have power in the future. Why the Clintons raise money. A circular thing. To blame them from taking money, they get offered more money than most people have no chance of being president. You have to organize that. This goes so much beyond how long you're in office or term limits or the bottom line is any billionaire in the world can get any politician on the phone at any time unless they're blatantly being indicted for something because whether you're giving them cash or whatever the fact that they could help you out of office, even if only in office two years, your kids get jobs at their companies and work for them as a consultant, you can't remove that effect that there's super wealthy people. That's going more and more decades -- you can't end. Certain politicians who don't live off of it as much as Hillary, for example, Bernie Sanders, but they're not successful and don't get a lot of policy done because they're not playing the games and they haven't achieved a whole like, like a Clinton would because they're not working with possibly somewhat impressionable influences.Wall Street, Main Street Sending Mixed Signals on EconomyJonas Max Ferris: Main Street has been pretty negative since '09. Economy across people who have money since then waiting for the bottom to drop out and you know, the bottom line is, is not the greatest economy in the world but the stock market continues to do well, has done well for many years, and it's because largely because rates are low, but also because wealth globally grows and not main street wealth, it's the upper -- that money has to go somewhere. To quote a line in a movie, how many yacht cans you own. You have to buy stocks no matter what because rates are low and that's where the money is going to go. It's not everybody's economy so you don't feel comfortable about it.Gary B. Smith: By the way, Dagen, that's where all the retail sales are going. Yeah. The old-line retailers like Macy's and, you know, those, they're struggling, but because we're all shopping at amazon these days. But I think that Wall Street has it right in terms of the stock market and the reason is, this might be the only time you're going to ever hear me say this, is that the Obama economy, as horrible as it is, and has been good for the stock market. You know, under the Obama thinking or whatever, planning, the stock market is up, inflation adjusted, 100 percent. That's better than it was under Reagan. That's almost Bill Clinton levels, better than both the bushes, better than Jimmy Carter. That's pretty significant there. I don't argue when the market is making new highs. It's telling us something, maybe Jonas has said we have no other place to put the money and low interest rates, but right now if we had eight more years of Hillary, god bless, probably should be good for the market.John Layfield: I was shocked when Gary B. said eight more years of Hillary. Something I never thought I would hear come out of Gary B. going to the stock market that makes a lot of sense. It's a bifurcated story and both sides are right. Main Street has apprehension about the slow growth but Wall Street is spot on just as Gary B. says. The reason is comparison. Look, 80 percent of government issued debt out of Japan and Germany are for negative interest rate. 60 percent-plus of S&P stocks are yielding higher than our own 10-year treasury. We are a bargain for money. Any problems in Europe and Asia, money flows into U.S. equities and that's what we're seeing.Cathy Taylor: Jonas is right institutional money has bailed us out time and time again but what happened after the Clinton, it was economic disaster. We're still recovering from Bill Clinton's economy. And there's not a lot to be excited about. The thing is that Main Street and Wall Street, there's an intersection and when one isn't doing well the other will not do well. Whoever becomes president inherits an expensive ObamaCare disaster and outdated uncompetitive tax code, a lack of infrastructure and jobs and infrastructure, and a global economy that, you know, between possible contagions in Venezuela, huge pressures in Europe from decades of poor growth policies and loss of pressure from the refugee crisis there's not lots to be excited about. In Washington we like to say never make summer vacation plans in august.Nomi Konst: So I know that we're still suffering from Bill Clinton's economy. I thought we were still suffering from George W. Bush's economy and income inequality. I think the political landscape shifting and political internal landscape shifting so that people like me as a progressive as a populist I fear an economy under Hillary Clinton in a lot of ways. She came out and said she was going to invest money into infrastructure, something that Donald Trump has not said. He has not got into details. Now does that mean that's going to be good for Main Street? I hope. That's what we need. That's why when Barack Obama put in Tim Geithner, which shows a lot.  Report: DEA Regularly Monitors Americans' Travel Plans, Seizes CashGary B. Smith: Not only do they take the money and they don't charge in most cases the drug whatever they are mules or whatever, with criminal offense. This is a way to fund police departments, law enforcement, sometimes makes up 20 percent of their budget when you use the information to fight terrorists I'm fine. Use it to gather money for no criminal reason I don't like it.Cathy Taylor: I don't think profiling is a dirty word per se. Businesses do it to serve you better. Doctors do it to assess you. Gary is right. We have to uphold innocent until proven guilty in the country. The foundation of who we are. If someone is guilty take the money but charge them as well.Jonas Max Ferris: They're innocent they don't have to give the money to the government. They're crooks and know it. They are getting off scot free. I don't like this on a local level. Stories where they take cars and money from people seize it because they think they're drug dealers. This is interesting on a federal level because it lower taxpayer's costs and putting people in prison what does that serve? This reduces the incentive to do a crime and yet maintains their ability to go legit and realize that was a dumb career path. I think it can work.Nomi Konst: Thumbs up because as long as companies are doing this getting away with it as Cathy said, I would rather have the government searching and seizing money, like they got $509 million in 15 airports, $209, 5200 people and those people are informants. If this reduces which I do think drugs is a form of terrorism and keep that in mind we would not have the drug dealers in our country if we did not have terrorists in Afghanistan fueling it.John Layfield: The problem like Gary B. says the incentive could be a problem because they consider this money in the budget before they find the money. So that incentive can be a slippery slope. However if you want to stop crime, you stop the money flow and that respect I am -- I have no problem with this.Stock PicksGary B. Smith: (DAL) Gains 20 percent in a yearJohn Layfield: (VOD) up 20 percent in 1 yearJonas Max Ferris: (EWZS) returns 20 percent in 1 year"	['Blumenthal', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	['god']

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Continuing now with our lead story: distorting the record on poverty off President Obama's remarks about Fox News. With us, the author of the brand new book, big hit -- My Journey with Maya"" very good read. Mr. Tavis Smiley. You heard Bernie and I, go.TAVIS SMILEY, AUTHOR, ""MY JOURNEY WITH MAYA"": First of all, there are many of us who have been trying to get this president to talk about poverty for years now. So one I'm just glad to see the President finally talking about poverty, saying the p word. Not just income inequality, not just the middle class but poverty. So one, I'm glad to hear him say that.Number two there is no doubt about the data, Bill. Two parents are better than one. Let me underscore -- the right two parents. You all talk about the black family as if it just collapsed like a sort of souffle. There are reasons for the dissolution of the black family. Clearly some folk make bad choices but there have also been government policies that have gotten in the way.For example, there have been policies on the books for years where if you have your baby daddy in the house with you, then the government cuts your check. They cut those resources, but I thought we wanted the family to come together so there have been government programs that have led to this dissolution as well as bad choices.O'REILLY: Ok. But that is public policy. I'm big on the personal thing.SMILEY: Sure.O'REILLY: Because I'm a former high school teacher. I taught a lot of black kids, all right? I saw the ones with involved parents prosper while the ones with parents who didn't give a fig go down. And so I want to declare a war on irresponsible parents.You are right about the government policy. But take that out of it, for example. If you have two parents, even if they don't have much money, who are just hell bent on getting their kid educated, he does his homework, he is respectful, this, and that. That child is not going to be in poverty, come on.SMILEY: I had two parents and I grew up in poverty. I had brothers and sisters. I am one of 10 kids. I have been blessed to do extremely well. But I have nine brothers and sisters who are still fighting their way out of poverty. Just because you grew up in a family two parents doesn't mean that you don't have to struggle in this world because racism is real. Discrimination is real. These gaps, these disparities between black and white economically are real.O'REILLY: All right. I want to go to another topic.There is a woman Cynthia Tucker, very far left woman who attacks Dr. Ben Carson and she says, quote, ""The good doctor's foray into Republican presidential politics threatens to become his epitaph to overshadow perhaps even overwhelm his academic and surgical accomplishments. He will likely to be remembered as the GOP's latest black mascot, a court jester, a minstrel show."" He'll be the Herman Caine of 2016 because she doesn't like Dr. Carson's opinion on Obamacare.SMILEY: Why is Cynthia Tucker using your word attacking Ben Carson but Ben Carson wasn't attacking the President?O'REILLY: I don't know about that.SMILEY: Oh, come on, Bill. Stop that. You heard the comments that Ben Carson made about the President. He has done it repeatedly and he's done it to Republican applause when he attacks the President.O'REILLY: You don't justify bad behavior by pointing to other bad behavior.SMILEY: I'm not justifying. I'm just asking you a question.O'REILLY: He attacked Obamacare.SMILEY: She attacked Ben Carson but you don't say that Ben Carson attacked the President.O'REILLY: Did Ben Carson use any racially loaded terms? No. This is a racially-loaded deal.SMILEY: You are smarter than that the fact that you don't use a racially-tinged term doesn't mean you are not attacking.O'REILLY: You are deflecting a well-known talker's racism.SMILEY: You are deflecting from the attack that Ben Carson --O'REILLY: It was on Obamacare.SMILEY: It wasn't just on Obamacare.O'REILLY: It was on Obamacare -- this is what's rolled this.SMILEY: It's on the President. Here is the bottom line on Ben Carson -- I won't use his language, that her language. Here is my assessment. Ben Carson has been respected and revered. Not just respected but revered, admired in black America for years for his gifted hands that he still possesses. But Ben Carson is, how might I put this is he a black bull in a Republican China shop. And if he's not careful, he's going to do himself irreparable damage. He's going to do the Party damage and I were a person in his face who professed to love Ben Carson I'd call for an intervention to stop him from doing what he's doing to himself and his reputation.O'REILLY: Be that as it may, this is a racial attack on Dr. Carson because this woman holds a different opinion on Obamacare than he does. This is wrong. This is wrong.SMILEY: You invited me earlier to read the entire piece that you did about LBJ and poverty.O'REILLY: I read the entire piece ten times.SMILEY: In this piece she makes it clear that he has been respected for years and she doesn't like the idea that he will allow himself to be a token at the risk of his reputation for the party.O'REILLY: Last question. Last question.SMILEY: Yes.O'REILLY: If a white person had written these words against Dr. Ben Carson or any other African-American, that person would be out of business.SMILEY: One, it happens every day. Number two, it's not in my language. Number three, Ben Carson has to be careful that what he does doesn't invite that same kind of attack on him.O'REILLY: I think he can speak his mind. But this was off the chart.SMILEY: He ought to be stick to neurosurgery though. Politics is not his game.O'REILLY: That's your opinion.SMILEY: You have got to know the issues.O'REILLY: That's your opinion.SMILEY: You have got to know the issues.O'REILLY: Tavis Smiley, everybody.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.
