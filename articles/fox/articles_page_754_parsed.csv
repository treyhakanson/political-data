This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight. Two big things happened today on the campaign trail. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, one week before the crucial Wisconsin primary, endorsed Senator Ted Cruz.And Donald Trump's campaign manager was slapped with misdemeanor criminal charges for simple battery against a female reporter. Whereupon the candidate defended his staffer and went after the alleged victim in the case.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. We'll get to Governor Scott Walker's endorsement in just a bit. But first, dramatic developments today in the Trump campaign saga that began back on March 8.  Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was walking the candidate to a crown following an event in Florida, when a reporter for a pro-Trump website Michelle Fields asked Trump a question. According to a tweet that night from Fields' boyfriend Jamie Weinstein of the Daily Caller, Lewandowski tried to pull Fields to the ground when she asked a tough question.Fields herself did not way in until two days later when her firsthand account of what happened was published online. Fields' claimed she was, quote, ""I jolted backwards. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken."" Trump Spokesperson Hope Hicks, released a statement that afternoon denying the incident ever occurred and suggesting, quote, ""Not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident.""As it turns out, neither of those assertion is true. First, Washington Post reporter Ben Terris said he did witnessed the incident. And released a report that same day confirming the Michelle Fields' story, recounting that he, quote, ""Watched as a man with short-cropped hair and a suit grabbed Michelle's arm and yanked her out of the way. He was Corey Lewandowski. Trump's 41-year-old campaign manager.""Moreover, videotape did capture the incident, as did audiotape that was released the very same day the Trump camp denied the story. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE FIELDS, FORMER BREITBART REPORTER: Holy (bleep).BEN TERRIS, WASHINGTON POST REPORTER: Yes, he just threw you down.FIELDS: I can't believe he just did that. That was so hard. Was that Corey?TERRIS: Yes, like, what threat were you?FIELDS: That was insane. You should have felt how he grabbed me. That's insane. Oh my gosh! I've never had anyone do that to me from a campaign.TERRIS: Can I out that in my story?FIELDS: Yes, go for it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Fields provided evidence of injuries she said were caused by Lewandowski, posting these pictures on Twitter of the bruises she says she sustained during the altercation. For his part, Lewandowski intensified his attacks on Fields, calling her a quote, ""attention seeker"" and calling into question her past reporting. Later that night, Donald Trump himself weighed in.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I heard that nothing happens. You know, we're surrounded by Secret Service and when they left, you all set? We're surrounded by Secret Service, we have many Secret Service. You see some of them here. When we left, I spoke to them, nothing happened. This was, in my opinion, made up. He didn't hear about it until like the next day. So, I wasn't involved in it but the Secret Service was surrounding everybody. They said nothing happened. Everybody said nothing happened. Perhaps she made the story I think that's what happened, okay?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: The Trump camp attacks on Fields continued the next day. As Lewandowski tweeted that Fields was, quote, ""totally delusional."" And that he said he never touched her. Fields filed a criminal compliant with authorities in Florida that afternoon and we saw the release of several videos showing the incident. The video show that Trump was in fact, just inches from Miss Fields that day and that that Lewandowski was close enough to have touched Fields who you see with the red arrow on the left side of your screen. Later that night, Fields came on ""The Kelly File"" making clear all she really wanted initially was an apology -- (audio gap).(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FIELDS: I didn't want to make a big deal out of it because, you know, I didn't want to be all over the press and I certainly was worried about my job. Hope Hicks, who is Donald Trump's spokeswoman, asked for my cell phone number and I was told that I was going to get an apology. So, I waited on that. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. This wasn't going to be a big deal. They were going to apologize, we will move on.  But I never got that apology. Instead, yesterday they released a statement calling me a liar.They have basically done a character assassination on me. If you were to ask me in private a week ago, who do you support? I would say that Donald Trump was my second choice for president. And, you know, Donald Trump always talks about my people, that he loves his people, his people love him. Wouldn't I be considered his people? This has to be aside from my father's death, the worst experience I've gone through.KELLY: This morning, police in Florida announced charges would be brought.  Lewandowski turned himself in and was charged with simple battery, a misdemeanor. That requires proof that the defendant, quote, ""actually and intentionally touches another person against the will of the other.""  Contrary to claims you may have heard in the last hour, no malice must be proven in order to secure a conviction. As police announced the charges, they also released another video. Along with a sworn police report by Criminal Investigation's Detective Marc Bujnowski of the Jupiter Police Department concluding that Lewandowski, quote, ""Grabbed Fields' left arm intentionally and against her will.""Although the Trump camp again has denied that this incident was captured by any cameras, that was their initial statement. This tape here was obtained by police from the Trump property on which the altercation took place.  After initially insisting that this incident never happened, and accusing Fields of, quote, ""making it up,"" Mr. Trump himself was out today suggesting that Fields' bruises are possibly fake or caused by someone other than Lewandowski. He said his campaign manager who is on record of saying, he, quote, ""Never touched Fields,"" was being maligned and that Fields was the real aggressor that day.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Those tapes to me are very conclusive. A lot of people are looking and saying how can anybody be charged? She was actually -- if you look at her -- according to a lot of people, she's grabbing at me and he's acting as an intermediary and trying to block her from doing that. I think they've really hurt a very good person, and I know it would be easy for me to discard people. I don't discard people. I stay with people. If you look at that tape, he was very, very seriously maligned. She was grabbing me. Does that mean that I'm supposed to file charges against her? She was grabbing me. How do you know those bruises weren't there before?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's what the police --TRUMP: I don't know what the police said. How do you know those bruises weren't there before? I'm not a lawyer. But she said she had a bruise on her arm. I mean, to me, if you're going to get squeezed, wouldn't you think that she would have yelled out a scream or something if she has bruises in her arm?KELLY: Joining me tonight, Florida Attorney and Trump supporter David Wohl along with Ben Shapiro, the editor-in-chief of DailyWire.com. Ben was also the news editor-at-large at Breitbart.com, the website in which Michelle Fields' work when this happened. He resigned along with Michelle Fields because of how the website handled Michelle's case refusing to stand by her.Thank you both for being here. Ben, your reaction today to now charges being filed against Mr. Lewandowski?BEN SHAPIRO, THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILYWIRE.COM: I mean, look, lying liars lie. And this is the Trump campaign. Where lies are told and then lies are told to cover up the lies and then finally knew lies are told in order to cover up the lies that were told about the lies. Cory Lewandowski grabbed Michelle, he yanked Michelle, he bruised Michelle, that was obvious from the tape. Michelle told that story. Ben told that story. Corey Lewandowski lied about that story. Trump lied about that story. And now they are telling a whole new set of lies.The story has evolved from Corey Lewandowski never touched Michelle Fields to, well, she sort of had it coming, that's the new tape, she sort of had it coming because she clearly was in a position to hurt Donald Trump. So Corey Lewandowski ought to have a medal of honor for jumping in and defending his boss by the way who was surrounded by Secret Service who do nothing because Michelle Fields is obviously no threat to Donald Trump.  Donald Trump is a smoking garbage heap of human debris and so is Corey Lewandowski, in my opinion.KELLY: David?DAVID WOHL, TRUMP SUPPORTER: Brilliant commentary.KELLY: So Ben is not a Trump fan. But let's start -- but on the legal evidence -- you're a lawyer, as am I.WOHL: Yes.KELLY: What happened to the incident never happened, it never happened --WOHL: Well, Megyn --KELLY: -- and Lewandowski's claims that he never happened?WOHL: Yes. Because it didn't happen, Megyn. What she describes happening never happened. I mean, I have the affidavit of arrest right here, Megyn.  And it is very, very clear. What it says, what she told officers, this is the important part, she said after she asked Mr. Trump a question, she felt someone yank her arm. She fell back, but caught herself from falling.  You can see very clearly in the surveillance video, that never happened.  What happened was, she snuck past Secret Service and there's apparently a Secret Service agent who told the daily mail that he told her to stop twice and she went passed him anyway. Snuck past, she then grabbed Mr. Trump on the arm, asked him a question. Corey saw that and coming to the defense of his boss, went up to her --KELLY: Okay. Okay --WOHL: -- grabbed her arm and moved to her aside so they could exit the building. That's all that happened.KELLY: There's a lot to unpack there. There's a lot to unpack there.  First of all, let's just start with the notion that Secret Service somehow perceives Miss Fields as a threat or told her twice, what happened to Mr. Trump's assertions repeatedly that the Secret Service said nothing  happened. That he talked to the Secret Service. You heard them on camera.  They said nothing happened. Nothing happened. The Secret Service told.  So, something happened, how did it get changed? And how did the initial statement of Cory Lewandowski that I never touched her transferred to your defense which is, I saw her and in defense of Mr. Trump I touched her.WOHL: Yes. Well, because that is what Corey did. The Secret Service agent I'm sure said nothing happened because what he witnessed was Corey going up to Michelle, grabbing her on the arm, moving her to the side so they could exit the venue.KELLY: No, Mr. Trump said the Secret Service said this didn't happened -- no, let me finish. Let me finish. Mr. Trump says, Secret Service said nothing happened and then Mr. Trump said right after, I think she made it up.WOHL: I think -- well, she obviously made up what she said, Megyn, because she wasn't jolted aside, she wasn't almost knocked to her butt. She didn't have to stop herself from falling. That never happened. It was a total embellishment of the facts. And if a jury sees this, Megyn, what she reported versus the surveillance video of what actually happened, this case is going nowhere.KELLY: All right. Just to clear the record, Ben, I want to give you the floor. But this is what she -- because Mr. Trump today repeatedly said, go back and listen to what she said when it actually happened which we played for the audience right there, which she said, I almost fell but I maintained my balance. But this is, let's go back to the contemporaneous audiotape that caught the altercation. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FIELDS: You should have felt how hard he grabbed me. That was really awful. That is so unprofessional.TERRIS: What threat were you?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: So in the moment, Ben, Donald Trump says once she learned how rich I was, she changed her story. That is what she said in the moment. That's the incident being caught on tape seconds after.SHAPIRO: Yes. I'm sure that Michelle Fields was deeply unaware of how rich Trump, because clearly Trump is the most humble of men and has never mentioned his wealth at any point in his long and illustrious career and bloviating about his inflated sense of wealth. The whole thing is ridiculous. How many times you have to change your story before you just come out and apologize for your campaign manager bruising a woman and then lying about her repeatedly. And now apparently Trump's at a rally right now, where he's imitating Michelle Fields in reading her affidavit in dramatic voice, because this is what Trump does. Again, Trump has no capacity to do two things that are actually required of any decent human being.WOHL: You know what Megyn?KELLY: Let him finish. Let him finish.SHAPIRO: Apologize when you're wrong and -- when you're wrong.KELLY: Right.WOHL: When it comes to the bruising, she tweeted the bruising out, a photo of her alleged bruising caused by Corey 18 hours after the incident. When she tried to prosecute Corey in the court of social media and failed, that's when she made a police report and lied about what happened because the video surveillance shows what happened and it was nothing even resembling what she said.SHAPIRO: So she lied to the police and she is obstructing justice now, is now what you're accusing --(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)WOHL: That might be following a false police report. I mean --  KELLY: The police are the ones who released that videotape, David. The police are the ones who released the videotape. We can see him touch her on the tape, David. Are you now telling us not to believe our own lying eyes?WOHL: No, no, no, no. What I'm saying is, I'm telling you not to believe her embellishment. What you see is her moving. Megyn, that happens probably dozens of times, dozens of times.KELLY: But all along the Trump camp has said, it didn't happen. He didn't touch -- so, David, if he didn't touch her --WOHL: He touched her. I agree with you, he touched her. I agree.KELLY: Then why did he say he didn't, David?WOHL: What he said was, no, no, what he was reacting to, Michelle Fields' account of what happened. And he said he didn't do that.KELLY: No, that's not true, David.SHAPIRO: That's not what he said.KELLY: David, that's not true. I just showed the tweets and billions of people, what Corey Lewandowski said was, I never touched you. In fact, I've never even met you.WOHL: Because based on what Michelle Fields described, I'm sure he thought, wait a second, that never happened. Who is this person saying that I grabbed her and almost threw her to the ground? He's probably didn't link it to this incident, obviously.KELLY: Okay. Let me ask you this question, Ben. Let me ask you because what happens when the presidential candidate himself weighs in, is there's a lot of backlash. And, you know, we've talked a lot during the Obama administration about how he should be very careful about weighing in on cases like Trayvon Martin and Ferguson, because they hold a lot of power when they have those big microphones and there can be significant backlash against the target. Michelle Fields is 28-years-old, she's now unemployed or she no longer has employment with Breitbart at least, and I don't know that she's got somebody protecting her as Mr. Trump comments forcefully about her. You know her. What is she going through tonight?SHAPIRO: I think Michelle is having a tough time. You know, I was texting just before this. And I've been encouraging Michelle to come on TV and tell her part of the story since she's obviously being lied about by Mr. Trump and presumably by the rest of the Trump campaign all day today. One of the reasons she didn't want to do this is she's expressed to me repeatedly today is again, and she's been saying consistently for three weeks, she didn't want to be the center of the story in the first place.  All she wanted was an apology. She's sick of being labeled an attention seeker by people like David just because she told the truth about Corey Lewandowski.WOHL: Well, you know, first of all, I haven't said that, Ben. That's a lie right there, I haven't said that.SHAPIRO: I said people like you.(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)KELLY: David didn't say it but the campaign manager did.SHAPIRO: That's right.WOHL: They're totally inconsistent. Totally.KELLY: All right. Guys, I mean --SHAPIRO: Totally inconsistent? Totally inconsistent, really? So let me ask you this --WOHL: Yes, totally inconsistent. What she told --KELLY: I've got to go. I've got to go. Don't talk over each other because that's annoying. But Ben, I'll give you a quick chance to respond.  Go ahead.SHAPIRO: All I can say is that essentially the Trump campaign is saying, we can tell you any lie that you want to hear, so long as you believe us rather than tape. We'll provide tape, we'll provide audio, we'll provide contemporaneous witness account. None of it matters because Donald Trump says something and what the great Donald says must go.KELLY: Thank you both for being here.WOHL: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Also tonight, Newt Gingrich is here on why he thinks Donald Trump needs to win on the first ballot at this summer's convention.Plus, the Wisconsin primary is turning into a dramatic dog fight after Ted Cruz picks up a big endorsement and Trump takes a hit from some conservative radio hosts in that state. One of those hosts Charlie Sykes is here with his prediction of this critical vote.And Trump supporter and former U.S. Senator Scott Brown will explain why he thinks none of this is going to slow down the Trump train. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight. New developments in the battle for Wisconsin.  The next big primary is exactly one week from tonight, and the three remaining Republican contenders are fighting it out for the 42 delegates up for grabs in this primary. The latest Real Clear Politics average shows Ted Cruz polling just slightly ahead of Donald Trump.And Chief Political Correspondent campaign Carl Cameron reports tonight from Madison, Wisconsin. Carl.CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, apart from the flap over Trump's campaign manager, there is very, very tight, hotly contested race going on here in the badger state. And tomorrow comes a new poll from Marquette University. Highly respected in this state and if it's like (INAUDIBLE) it will show that this is a very, very tight race, particularly between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. And Cruz today got a big boost from the state's Governor Scott Walker, an endorsement that was expected. Walker had been hinting about it. And he did give his endorsement today.  They weren't actually together, but Mr. Walker says that he will be campaigning with Trump aggressively. He'll campaign every day until now until next Tuesday. And there will be several appearances with Cruz. Now, Cruz is actually going to leave the state tomorrow to go to California to be a late night TV and to fund-raise, leaving the state in a race this hotly contested is potentially a big, big risk. And Cruz today was going after Trump saying that he's got to come clean on what happened with his campaign manager. Trump in turn called Ted Cruz the establishment candidate. He also badmouthed Scott Walker and said that the state is not doing as well as economically as Walker has been boasting and he asked a crowd earlier tonight what they thought of Paul Ryan, the House Speaker who also lives in this state.And Paul Ryan actually got booed in his own hometown of Janesville. Trump is playing very, very hard against Cruz, he wants to win this state. If Cruz were to win here, it could dramatically slow down Trump's ability, if not halt his ability to clinch the necessary 1237 delegates for the nomination before the actual convention. And with those two battling it out, there's still John Kasich. Trump calls Kasich an establishment guy, hasn't really been spending much time arguing with him because frankly in this state, Kasich isn't competing all that hard. He has been trying, but he has already been saying that he's not got high expectations. He's looking forward to states in the east, particularly in Pennsylvania and upcoming New York, towards at the end of this month, where he thinks he can get delegates, stay in the race and continue to fight his way to the convention -- Megyn.KELLY: Carl, thank you.Well, just yesterday, Donald Trump spoke with one of the most important conservative voices in all of Wisconsin. Charlie Sykes is an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump's and the two men sparred over Trump's treatment of Heidi Cruz and women in general. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLIE SYKES, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, RIGHTWISCONSIN.COM: So, is this your standard that if a supporter of another candidate, not the candidate himself, does something despicable that it's okay for you, personally a candidate for president of the United States, to behave in that same way?  I mean, I expect that from a 12-year-old bully on the playground. Not somebody who wants the office hold by Abraham Lincoln.TRUMP: Well, I did a retweet and it was a retweet by somebody else, because I have a lot of support, I have a tremendous amount of very fervent supporters. I can tell you this, Charlie, I have been better to women than any of these candidates, frankly. I've been --SYKES: Except you won't apologize to a woman that you mocked. Is this the way you would want anyone to -- you would want their sons to behave?TRUMP: I thought this was actually a dead issue until I just spoke to you.  I mean, I'd rather be --SYKES: Really?TRUMP: -- talking about trade --SYKES: Before you called into my show, did you know that I'm a #NeverTrump guy?TRUMP: That I didn't know.SYKES: Okay.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Charlie Sykes joins me now. He's a host on 620 WTMJ and editor-in- chief of RightWisconsin.com. Charlie, good to see you.SYKES: Good to see you.KELLY: So you spoke with him over 20 minutes or about 20 minutes and the interview went viral. It was sent around all over the internet. You know, Trump said today, I thought it just went fine. I thought we had a substantive exchange. What did you think?SYKES: Well, I thought it was -- I actually was naive enough to think that coming into Wisconsin where we have a traditional civility that maybe if he wanted to make the pivot from being the blustery bully to being presidential, that this would be a good occasion to say that wives were off-limits. Instead, what I got was the, he did it, he started it first.  And I kind of the wow moment, where, you know, this is the way, if you're a kid on the playground acts like that, you sit them down and explain, you know, every once in a while real men learn to apologize. You don't insult women. You don't behave in this particular way. You want the job that Abraham Lincoln had at any point. And I think what you saw there is that, he's not making any pivot, he is unwilling to apologize or admit that he made any mistake and he seems to be tone deaf about the way that his conduct and his treatment of women is actually playing in a state like Wisconsin.KELLY: But you know that he believes, and his defenders say, okay, maybe it's politically incorrect, but what he is showing is that he's a fighter.  So if he believes that Ted Cruz's Super PAC attacked Melania Trump, then he's going to attack Heidi Cruz and that politics is ugly, it's brutal, but that is the way it is.SYKES: Right. Yes. Well, that's the way it is with Donald Trump. And this is one of the ways he's debates this campaign. Look, I've been writing about political correctness way back when he was giving money to Hillary Clinton. This is not political correctness, this just boorishness, this is rudeness. And it's one of the reasons why he is so deeply underwater among women. I think that, you know, to the, you know, in the Trumpcan bubble, they may, you know, say this is touch politics, the reality is, but you have more than 70 percent of women who disapprove of him.KELLY: But don't you think he can get those numbers back up?SYKES: No. I think that what you're going to see in Wisconsin and I think you're going to see this next Tuesday is that in the vote-rich Southeastern Wisconsin area, he's going to lose and he's going to lose badly, and that's being driven by conservative Republican women who are repelled, not just on the issue but repelled by his treatment and his attitude towards women, that again, that's not political correctness, that is looking at a man going look, you would not allow your children to behave this way. You want to be the president of the United States, and when you're given an opportunity to behave like a responsible human being, you say, well, he started it?KELLY: Hmm. Charlie, I have to go. Quick answer, does this Governor Scott Walker endorsement matter at all?SYKES: Yes. It does matter. It is going to be considerable and the fact that Donald Trump has decided to respond by attacking Scott Walker in a state where he is still very, very popular is weapons grade stupid.KELLY: Good to see you, sir.SYKES: Thank you.KELLY: Joining me now, someone with a different view. Former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown, FOX News contributor and Donald Trump supporter. Senator, good to see you. So, pick up where Charlie left off and his charges about the women, the numbers with women I think right now, the disapproval rating among American women with Donald Trump is 73 percent.SCOTT BROWN, R-FORMER MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR: Well, first of all, I know Charlie, I have been on his show. I have a lot of respect for him. You know, Wisconsin is a battleground, as you know, when they talk about, you know, Wisconsin is a little bit different. Don't forget, we had recall elections, Governor Walker had death threats. There's so many things happening in Wisconsin that I think that's where the kind of the revolution aside from what happened in Massachusetts in my race, but what happened in Wisconsin with Governor Walker in particular, really started that anti- establishment movement.Now, with regard to women, listen, I don't agree with everything that Donald Trump says or does, but I do know that there are different levels in my view as to spouses, kids in elections. For example, if a spouse or a kid is going to step back and they're just married to the spouse or the son or daughter, that's different. But if a spouse is actually going to go out and play an active role, holding events, campaigning, unfortunately, the nature of the blood sport of politics is they'll going to be treated very similarly --KELLY: Even, even -- okay, so that's one thing, and you're going to get into the political mix, right?BROWN: And the civility in this race. I'm getting to a point, Megyn --KELLY: But what about the picture -- like tweeting out a picture suggesting she's not attractive?BROWN: The civility in this race on a whole host of issues is not exciting for me. I'm hopeful that they'll all start to focus on the things that we're seeing in Brussels, the things that we're seeing on a daily bases, our economy and our borders.KELLY: I think the American people want to see that, too.BROWN: That's what I'm looking forward to having happen.KELLY: The American people want to see that, too. But it's one thing if the spouse puts herself in the line and makes political points -- she's going to get hit. But, you know, the thing that Trump got hit for last week was, he tweeted out a picture suggesting she's less un-attractive and certainly less attractive than Melania Trump and he was mocking her looks.BROWN: Listen, they're both lovely women. Okay. They both love their husbands and their husbands love them. Can we at least say that?KELLY: It's not really just about their love for their husbands. It's about their accomplishments of women, I mean, Heidi Cruz is a Harvard business graduate, Melania Trump is an experienced and talented business executive --BROWN: Right.KELLY: I mean, it's really not about their love for their husbands, it's about them as independent professional women.BROWN: They're both independent, lovely women. Okay. So that's great.  And that's enough really said. And when you're going to play an active role, you're going the get hit. Now, I want to focus and I've encourage all the candidates to focus on the things that you and I were just talking about. I mean, what Ben and David were going at was unfortunately typical of what's happening not only with the Republicans but quite frankly with Hillary and Bernie supporters. You heard Sarah Sarandon, I mean, they're just fed-up. There's a tremendous amount of anger, which we're seeing right here develop, I think it started in Massachusetts, went to Wisconsin and we're seeing it more and more each day.KELLY: Uh-hm.BROWN: And here's the thing with Charlie. And like I said, I have a lot of respect for him. He's a never Trump guy. Well, I guess he's been a pro-Hillary guy. Because if he and other like him don't unite, the only way Donald Trump if he's the nominee loses is if people don't unite behind our candidate. If it's Cruz, I'm with him. If it's Kasich, I'm with him.  So, that's the difference between me and others. And my message to everybody is, you know what, when this is over, we're going to have a lot of soul searching, a lot of healing, because we are Americans first. We do need to work together to really take back our status in the world.KELLY: Yes. Maybe it will be you.BROWN: Maybe it will be you.KELLY: You swooped in, in that Massachusetts election and shocked the country. So, who knows -- if there's a second ballot in Cleveland. It's great to see you, Senator.BROWN: Yes. That's not going to happen. I was honored to be a senator in Massachusetts. In that revolution I believe started here, because don't forget, they had 40, we made 41.KELLY: That's right.BROWN: And then you saw the Senate get more and more. Then the House got taken over.KELLY: And then they changed the rules in the Senate so they nullified it.(CROSSTALK)That's right. I've got to go. We're out of time.BROWN: Okay. You get it. All right. Nice to see you.KELLY: Great to see you. No, it's a fun story. Thank you for being here.Well, the other big story tonight is a battle tested Republican strategist who worked with President Ford back in that contested convention back in '76 has now signed on to Team Trump.And Newt Gingrich is here on what that means and how it could prove critical during the GOP convention.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight. Team Trump confirming that the republican front- runner has hired a veteran republican strategist to help him what promises to be a long delegate fight ahead of Cleveland.The campaign enlisting Paul Manafort, a man who helped President Gerald Ford manage his 1976 contested convention battle against Ronald Reagan.Joining me now to discuss it, Fox News contributor, former republican presidential and author of the novel ""Duplicity,"" Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, great to see you tonight. I love that ""Duplicity.""NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be with you.KELLY: All right. So, let's talk about this, and whether this signals a growing seriousness by Mr. Trump when it comes to this other piece of the game, which is shoring up your delegates and their commitment to you.GINGRICH: Look, I think we have to remember this is the first time Donald Trump has ever run for anything and he decided to run for president. So, he's having to learn a lot of stuff on the job in public, sometimes embarrassingly.They found out in Louisiana they weren't prepared. They really weren't ready to get that involved in this one state at a time delegate by delegate fight. And they brought in a real pro. Paul Manafort is as good as there is in this business. He will immediately improve the Trump campaign's ability to fight this kind of grassroots campaign, and it's a good thing they have, because Cruz put together a very professional very solid campaign.And until Manafort came on, Trump just didn't have anybody of the same level of talent. So, I think you'll now see the Trump people within a few days become dramatically better at winning the delegate fight.KELLY: But it still doesn't make sense to me. I understand how in the -- if there's no majority winner on the first ballot, then the delegates are free to do what they want. You know, forget you Trump, forget you Cruz, I'm going to vote for who I want. I get that.How can you win over a delegate who was sort of pledged to a different candidate before the delegate gets to cast the ballot on the first vote at the convention?GINGRICH: Well, let's say you pick somebody who is not actually for your candidate, and that person is willing to vote for the candidate in the first ballot, they're legally bound to by most state laws.But there's a platform fight, there's a rules committee fight, there are resolution fights. And on lot of other things they may decide to vote not the way they're legally bound, because the legal binding is only for the candidates.So, one of the reasons it's so important for Trump to win in the first ballot is he's going to have a number of ballots who are not reliable on the second or third ballot.KELLY: It's a free for all.GINGRICH: But legally have -- it's a free for all.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: That first ballot to get in.GINGRICH: And he needs to win on round one. That's right.KELLY: Let's talk about the Trump campaign and the discipline or lack thereof that we've seen in recent days. You know, today we saw the candidate himself come out and attack Michelle Fields after his campaign manager was criminally charged.And, you know, there really wasn't any need for Donald Trump to insert himself in the middle of that fight not withstanding to his loyalty to his campaign manager. He wasn't directly, it wasn't his fight. But he did so, attacking Heidi Cruz last week, which also did not need to be done.He's attacked others as you know who he didn't necessarily need to do that. What do you make of the repeated attacks, in particular, against women by a campaign that is struggling with women?GINGRICH: Well, I think in particular, in the case of Mrs. Cruz, it was a total mistake. He should have done it. He was angry because the Cruz super PAC had attacked his wife, Melania. But he had a lot of easy answers to come back and say look, she's beautiful, she's a supermodel, she was on a professional shoot for a very classy magazine. She would be a very attractive first lady, and get over it.Instead, he automatically attacked. And that's why I always recommend to people to read ""The Art of the Combat,"" Trump's book of the 990s. Because part of what he learned was to always counterpunch. If you watch him, he always counterpunches.I actually draw a distinction in the Lewandowski case because he was going to be asked about it. And Trump's basic model is to stay on offense.KELLY: Why couldn't he just say, this is my guy, a criminal process is going to play out, a jury will have its say, I'm not firing anybody until that happens and then we'll reassess. Or I mean, he could say what I saw on the tape didn't rise to me a fireable offense. That's understandable.But the demolition campaign against her reputation is a different -- is a different matter.GINGRICH: But notice the language you just used. Suddenly it goes wrong from a misdemeanor to a criminal violation which is...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: It is a criminal that he's been charge with a violation.GINGRICH: That's right. So, now we have is Lewandowski a criminal, OK?KELLY: Those are your words. That's what the police are saying.GINGRICH: No, no.KELLY: That he's been charged with a criminal misdemeanor.GINGRICH: That's right, criminal misdemeanor by a democrat local official in a county with a very long history of very partisan politics...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But you saw the tape and you heard the Washington Post independent account of what happened. I mean, no one is saying that this is -- this is a major beating. It's a simple battery, that's it.GINGRICH: Right. Ok. Simple battery, which has now been translated into a criminal offense. And you -- and you have never been in a scrum in a presidential campaign where people were shoved around, including by the way, by the press.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Of course I have, many times.GINGRICH: Including by the press.KELLY: Many times. She didn't want to file a federal police about -- a federal case over it, she wanted an apology, and then they attacked her and said she was delusional and suggested she made the whole thing up and try to question prior reporting. And to manage to know why she wouldn't file a police report and only talk about it online.So, what she do the next day she went to file the police report. That's how we got to this place. We got to leave it at that. It's a great speaking with you. Thanks for being here.GINGRICH: All right. Good talking to you.KELLY: Coming up, a split decision in the Supreme Court means a big win for labor unions. Plus, just a week away from the next democrat primary, the Clinton campaign warning Senator Bernie Sanders to watch his tone.Robert Zimmerman and Richard Fowler on what this means for the democratic race, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, the democratic presidential candidates going at each other hard with just a week to go until the next primary. Both Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders campaigning in Wisconsin today. And right now, the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows a very tight race there.Chief White House correspondent Ed Henry just filed this report from Milwaukee. Ed?ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, Hillary Clinton still has a commanding delegate lead over Bernie Sanders, but she appears to be getting nervous about the next big prize after Wisconsin, her home state.In fact, she's now added campaign events on Wednesday and Thursday in New York, even though the primary is not until late April. And her top strategist is rejecting a call by Sanders that they have a debate in New York.That strategist saying that there's just been too much of a negative tone from the Sanders' campaign. Well, I have to tell you, today, here in Wisconsin, Sanders refused to back down, and Clinton herself, despite the accusation that Sanders has gone negative, used a church as a backdrop to launch a new negative attack on Sanders over gun control.And then brought together some moms who had lost sons to gun violence. And with Clinton standing by, one of those moms launched a pretty negative attack on Sanders.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would rather be here with you in Appleton...(CROWD CHEERING)... than begging billionaires for their money. And this is one of the real differences of opinion that Secretary Clinton and I have.ANNETTE NANCE-HOLT, CLINTON SUPPORTER: If you want my vote you better work for it. I'm not going to give it to you just because you said you can do free college. Because if my child is dead, he can't go to college.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HENRY: It's pretty clear what's happening between both candidates right now. Sanders doesn't want to give up the negative attacks because they've been working, they've resonated. He's won six out of the last seven contests.And for Clinton, as the front-runner who wanted this race to be over a long time ago, the last thing she wants is another debate. Especially on her home turf. Megyn?KELLY: Ed Henry. But now since Ed filed that report, Hillary Clinton's campaign is saying they are in talks with the Sanders' campaign to debate in New York or any other place they can mutually agree on.Joining me now, Robert Zimmerman, a democratic strategy and DNC committee member, and Richard Fowler who is nationally syndicated radio host and senior fellow of the New Leaders Council.Good to see you both.RICHARD FOWLER, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: Good evening.ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY: All right, Robert, I mean, the messaging yesterday was clearly like, improve the tone or we won't be debating anymore.ZIMMERMAN: Well, actually, that may have been better since the interpretation of things and clearly, using expressing the frustration. I think a lot of those who are Clinton supporters feel. Hillary Clinton has been engaging in very tough attacks on Bernie Sanders but they've been focused on issues, they've been focused on his record.Bernie Sanders on the other hand, hasn't been talking about the record, he'd been running campaigns of innuendo, a personal attacks. And I think that's the reason that Hillary Clinton has gotten 2.5 million more votes than Bernie Sanders.KELLY: OK.(CROSSTALK)ZIMMERMAN: And why she's been strong for the nomination.KELLY: But not to sound -- not to sound too R-rated about it, Robert, but like, it's politics, right? So, it's like, look what is happening on the republican side. They're so mean to each other. Like, you can't just say to your opponent, Robert, you must be nicer in your tone.ZIMMERMAN: Well, actually, look, my side may need some group count, may need some couple counseling when this is over. But the republicans are going to need anger management therapy when they're done with their process.So, that's the difference. Yes, we have clearly a sharp debate going on. We've got some serious issues to debate. But we're certainly in a much better position for unity after the convention than the republicans certainly are.KELLY: OK. Richard, you tell me, I mean, if Hillary Clinton winds up going against Donald Trump and she tries to say, you must improve your tone or else we shall not debate. Can you imagine the tweets she's going to get?FOWLER: I can't, I'm pretty sure it's going to come like 3.30 in the morning when he sent out these weird tweets. But I've got to tell you. I agree with Robert at one point. I think we only need Jerry Springer or Sally Jessie Raphael.KELLY: That doesn't solve anything.FOWLER: All of them. Sure.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: It gets ratings though.FOWLER: But here's the thing, I think debates and tough debates make Hillary a better candidate, there is no question. All likelihood is she going to be the nominee. Another debate with Bernie Sanders will not hurt her as we go into a possible up -- or a possible match against Donald Trump or will say anything...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Yes. She's going to be able to take some, you know, punches, right?FOWLER: ... and do anything to win. Yes.ZIMMERMAN: Well, no one can ever critisize Hillary Clinton for not being able to take punches. Very few people have taken the hits she has had and come out successfully she has.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well, they're like they're mad that they're pointing out her Wall Street ties. Like, hello, what do you think is going to happen ifZIMMERMAN: But, Megyn, understand when it comes to standing up to Wall Street, Hillary Clinton has stood up to the biggest industry her stake.KELLY: Why? Because she has a story to tell.ZIMMERMAN: Now wait...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: That's not the same as saying, like you improve the tone.ZIMMERMAN: Oh, she didn't say that.KELLY: Fix the issues or we're not doing it. I mean, the thing is, Richard, she's already under criticism for being in a protective bubble. Remember, Chris Christie said Rubio was bubble boy. People say Hillary Clinton is bubble girl and that she -- they've intentionally limited the debate. They put them on like Christmas Eve at 11 p.m. People don't watch.And so, if she doesn't sort of get out there and get more battle tested and going head to head with somebody, whether its Cruz, Trump, whoever, Kasich, I don't know.FOWLER: Well, I think -- well, I think what you see here, Megyn, is when you see Hillary Clinton in the town halls where she has a longer time to really get to expand her answers, she's a lot more less bubbly, I guess is the right word and she's more real and authentic and people connect with her. And that's why I think another debate is just a step in the right direction for the Clinton campaign. They are happy they are having the conversation.(CROSSTALK)ZIMMERMAN: There are several more debates in the works, Megyn. So, don't be concerned. Their debates possibly in New York.KELLY: How about one on Fox News?ZIMMERMAN: Pennsylvania certainly talk about having one in California.KELLY: How about one at Fox News?ZIMMERMAN: I think it would be a great idea. I look forward to their proposal.FOWLER: They did a town hall. They did a town hall, Megyn. They did a town hall with Bret.ZIMMERMAN: Yes.KELLY: Richard, tell Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders they should sit down with yours truly.(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: I will -- I will call her right after this.KELLY: Bret Baier and Chris Wallace.ZIMMERMAN: I'd be glad to carry that message.KELLY: And sit for the same theme.FOWLER: We'll both campaign for it.KELLY: That even Donald Trump have Ford twice at three times.FOWLER: Only if I get to sit in the front row, Megyn. Only if I get to sit in the front row.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: You're there. You know somebody. I got you. Great to see you both.FOWLER: Take care. Good to see you too, Megyn.KELLY: Up next, Supreme Court, shocking news.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, a big win for labor unions today as the U.S. Supreme Court issues a split decision on whether unions can collect fees from workers who are not members. The court was expected to rule against the unions, but that was before the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last month.Fox News' Shannon Bream reports from Washington. Shannon?SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It was a simple no frills opinion, no names, no majority or dissent but its impact was a historic reminder of the absence of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.When this case which was brought by public school teachers in California who objected to being to pay fees to a union they didn't want to support, with argued way back in January, it appeared poised for a 5-4 decision. That would have struck a significant blow to public sector unions.But with sudden passing of Justice Scalia in February, everything was thrown in question. Today, we got the answer, a tie decision which sets no precedent and leave the lower court decision in the union's favor intact.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This underscores the importance of filling that ninth seat. It illustrates what its stake in this falls presidential election and it tells us that there are going to be many cases that will be decided by a 5 to 4 margin and the outcome is going to depend on who fills that ninth seat.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Bernie Sanders applauded today's ruling and warned, quote, ""The extreme right wing is just one conservative Supreme Court justice away from dismantling the rights of public sector unions.""Also today, the man President Obama has nominated to replace Justice Scalia had his first meeting with a republican senator. Mark Kirk who is facing a tough re-election battle in Illinois chatted with Merrick Garland and continues to buck GOP leadership and calling for hearings on garland's qualifications.As for the case, the attorneys for those teachers who challenge the union fees says they will petition the court to rehear the case and hope it will be held over for consideration until there are nine justices seated. Megyn?KELLY: Shannon Bream, thank you. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: We'll post our opening segment on the Michelle Fields situation on facebook.com/thekellyfile. Fields was supposed to join us tonight but decided not to appear.I spoke with her earlier and one thing is clear. Michelle Fields feels very much under attacked. She stands by her story and she wants not to be the news but instead to be covering it.Let me know your thoughts on Twitter or Facebook. And thanks for watching, everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly.

There are dozens of mouths to feed and relatives you haven't seen in a year.With so many personalities coming together, there are bound to be awkward moments around the table. But it doesn't have to devolve into a family feud, say experts.""There are a whole cast of characters in the families we live in,"" says Dr. Isabell Springer, Marriage and Family Councilor in Gainesville, Florida. ""It really takes someone taking the initiative for it to be a neutral zone.""So, if you've been designated as the one who will keep the peace, remember these tips:1. Don't be judgmental about the latest family news, keep your poker face and be supportive.This isn't a time to grill your family members with questions about what they've done over the year. Save that for a later date. Be prepared to hear some unexpected news, but don't comment on it to your kids or spouse until you leave the table.2. Have an escape plan if conversations get tense.""I've even had some families who.. when things get heated.. they'll break into song just to change that tone."" Says Dr. Silvia Echevarria-Doan, Associate Professor in the Marriage and Therapy Program at the University of Florida. Kids, traveling, pets and what you're thankful for: these are all go-to topics that can derail most arguments.3. Avoid sports and politics. First, keep the television off. You don't need the distraction or a reminder of events that can spark contentious debate.  Avoiding these hot topics will make it easier to pass the turkey with no hard feelings.4. Think about ordering in your Thanksgiving meal this year.""Ordering out is a great option because it takes some of the hassle off of those people who normally do the cooking. You could also have everyone bring a dish and create the meal that way,"" says Springer. Many supermarkets and local restaurants offer meals with all the trimmings. Prices start around $60 for a family of four and the food comes ready to be heated and then served. 5. No matter what the family history always compliment the host.Thanksgiving is about being together. Your host has no doubt spent hours preparing to make sure everyone enjoys themselves. Recognizing them for their hard work is the utmost sign of thankfulness. No matter what's happened in the past, remember that they still chose to invite you to dinner. And if it seems unbearable, remember that dinner is just a few hours. "	[]	[]

Bush	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" February 16, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEN CARSON, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Right now we're in what I call the ancient Roman coliseum stage. Everybody wants to go to the coliseum and see a fight.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This has been a pattern now with Ted. He spent the last days literally just making stuff up.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When radical Islamic terrorists wage jihad on the United States of American, the answer is not to tweet insults at them.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This guy Cruz comes out, well, I don't think he's going to win. This guy is so strident and so nasty he's going to lose every single state. Then Bush, poor Bush, he comes out. He goes, well, I don't think that Donald Trump can beat Hillary Clinton, but I can. I said, well, why aren't you beating me?(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: So the sights and sounds from South Carolina, and actually we can take a live look in Buford, South Carolina, a forum ongoing, Donald Trump talking about the war, talking about ISIS, just a moment ago said that ""9/11 would not have happened if I were president.""As you take a look at the latest polls out of South Carolina, the average of recent polls, the RCP average, you see Donald Trump up significantly. However, a caveat here. Most of these polls happened before the debate, at least a part of them. We expect different polling numbers or at least new polling numbers in the next day or so. We'll have our own Thursday morning.Let's bring in our panel, syndicated columnist George Will, editor in chief of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham, and David Gregory, former moderator of NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and author of the book, ""How Is Your Faith?"" OK, Laura, what about this, what's happening in South Carolina?LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE.COM: Trump has made a calculation that the only way to win this is to do what they did in the opening scene of the Godfather. You have to get in the revolving door, at the altar, at the phone booth. So he just decided, I guess, the only way to do it is to really settle the score on Bushism, on globalism, trade, immigration, the war. And he is doing it in a way that is really strident and really offends a lot of people. But I guess he is banking on the fact that there is not all that much affection for the policies of the Bushs but a lot of affection for the personality, the people, the patriotic side of the Bushs. It is a risky strategy.BAIER: In South Carolina.INGRAHAM: In South Carolina. Could it pay off? I think we're going to find out. But were all of these policies popular? I think when the Bushs respond to this they tend to go to personality. They tend to go to Donald Trump is a reality star. He's not serious. But I think the debate about these policies is a healthy one to have in the Republican Party. Was our policy toward China good? Did it really work out for us?BAIER: He doesn't want to re-litigate Iraq war or those decisions then.DAVID GREGORY, FORMER MODERATOR OF 'MEET THE PRESS': No, they don't. But the truth is in a kind of ugly way within the party, Trump is forcing a debate that a lot of people are not having, which is, and I don't think he is putting it very elegantly, but what are the leadership lessons of the Iraq War.I would like to hear Jeb Bush answer some of those questions, and I think the other candidates too, particularly in the context of how you are going to fight ISIS. That's a relevant debate to have. Not the way he is putting it now. Again, I think there is some calculation here of stridency and tapping into this anger. Don't forget we talk about Tea Party sentiment and all the rest. It was Bush who bailed out the big banks. So a lot of that angst and a lot of that anxiety, a lot of that anger starts under Bush as well as the extension of America in the Middle East and Afghanistan.BAIER: George?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: David is absolutely right. The Tea Party was a reaction against really the spending by the Bush administration. So there is a lot of sin to go around here.Mr. Cruz understands that if you keep the bombs going off, no one will focus any one of them.BAIER: You mean Trump.WILL: Trump. Sorry, yes. Trump, a few years ago he said when he was a birther, before he said Cruz wasn't eligible to be president, he said this president is not eligible to be president. He said I have investigators in Hawaii and they're finding amazing things. He never told us what they were because he had gone on to something else by then.And 23 days ago he said on television, any day now I will be announcing the senators who have endorsed me. No one has endorsed him yet and no one remembers that he said that. There's one likely senator some people think would be Jeff Sessions because he agrees with Trump on trade and immigration. I talked with Jeff Sessions today. He has no intention of endorsing anyone.BAIER: South Carolina CNN poll about people deciding -- definitely decided, 49 percent, leaning toward someone, 20 percent, still trying to decide, 31 percent. Laura, what is clear is that these early states, there's a lot of undecideds, a lot can happen in the final days.INGRAHAM: No doubt about it. I think South Carolina is a tricky place. It has a very interesting population along the coast, much more kind of establishment moderate Republicans. There's a strong evangelical base. They had that Bob Jones University forum on Friday. Trump didn't show up. He didn't have anyone at his table. Cruz and Rubio were there. Carson was there. They think they can make something of that.But there also is a poll out there that says that most Republicans in South Carolina think Trump sig thank you be the nominee. So you wonder how much despite his promises of things that don't happen if people just get the sense that Jeb carries too much weight in the past. Rubio maybe is a little too young. Carson is nice but he didn't really cut through. And Cruz might not catch on in other states, as smart as he is. So a lot of people might be thinking in this calculation he's probably the only guy who is going to win it so we're going to throw in with him even with all of our reservations.Again, I think that's what their strategy is. Remember, South Carolina, the Democrats aren't voting Saturday. I think Trump is going for a general electric play here, thinking he is going to pull some Democrats in maybe on that Iraq War comment, and maybe some of them will show up to vote for him even though a lot of Republicans certainly wouldn't have said it that way.BAIER: He clearly has a big lead heading in.I want to turn to the Democrats who are lining up ahead of Nevada. That's their caucus on Saturday. They're making a play for the African-American vote. Hillary Clinton in Harlem. Bernie Sanders with a number of moves. But Hillary Clinton's husband, the former president, saying this about the genome and the first black president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: Steve Cohen remarked that I was just a stand-in for the first black president.(LAUGHTER)BILL CLINTON: I'm happy to do that. But you know what else we learned from the human genome? We learned that unless your ancestors, every one of you, are 100 percent, 100 percent from sub Saharan Africa, we are all mixed race people.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: I'm just not sure how that plays.GREGORY: My very considered response on that is, what is he talking about?(LAUGHTER)GREGORY: Honestly it just strikes me as weird, honestly. I haven't looked at the genome project in detail in a while, but this is a bit of a problem with Bill Clinton riffing on the campaign trail. And one of the cautionary notes that he's been more disciplined, it seems, the potential for distraction if she is the president of the United States with the first husband seems to me rather high.BAIER: But as a campaigner, is it a liability or an asset to have Bill Clinton on the trail?WILL: I think it is an excitement, because you never quite know where he's going to go with this. I think what he is saying, and it is actually a truth, which is our genetic make-up is a really complicated thing after 200 generations. One of the four of us is almost certainly related to Charlemagne and one of the four of us is almost certainly related directly to 20 generations, to Charlemagne's group. So what? What's interesting is that the Democratic Party makes so much out of race and identity politics, to have him come out and say, by the way, race is a pretty blurry concept.BAIER: It doesn't really fit on a bumper sticker.INGRAHAM: No it doesn't. I agree with David. I don't really understand why he thought bringing that up there is going to help Hillary. Remember back in South Carolina in 2008 he made that comment about this is the biggest fantasy ever, paraphrasing about Obama. Hillary today was in Harlem and gave a speech about race, very emotional. She talked about privilege that white Americans, a lot of reference to white Americans. It struck me as kind of odd. I know you have a black you audience, but they're supposed to be unifying the country, yet it is always slicing and dividing the country into this identity politics moment.And I guess we're all at a speech code forum at Harvard University. Whatever happens at the university, George, you made this point, is trickling down and now into our political conversations. It is about white Americans think this and black Americans are supposed to think this. I thought we were all supposed to have our own individual thoughts. But maybe that's a fantasy as well.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, the left's foreign policy failures have made you, the American people, less safe. Now, according to a brand-new Fox News poll, 84 percent of Americans say they're nervous about the country's ability to prevent terrorist attacks while just 11 percent say they are confident.Now, these are very clear reasons why America's fearful -- are now fearful of these terror attacks. It has to do with the Obama administration's decisions over the last seven-and-a-half years.Now, plain and simple, they have refused to confront radical Islam head on.  Now, the administration originally labeled the Fort Hood terror attack as workplace violence. Now, they changed the name of the war on terror to overseas contingency operations, and instead of saying terrorism, well, they use the phrase man-caused disasters. And don't forget the president also called ISIS the JV team and one day before the jihadists massacred innocent people in Paris -- well, the president said ISIS was contained.And that's not all. The Obama administration has made many other key foreign policy mistakes. For example, they're releasing Gitmo detainees who are going back to the battlefield to kill again. And of course, they pulled out of Iraq prematurely, and that created a home base for ISIS.Now, the president -- remember, he drew a red line with Syria in the sand, and then he did nothing. And the White House gave the number one state sponsor of terrorism $150 billion as part of the Iranian nuclear deal. And don't forget they also gave F-16s, tanks, and over $1 billion to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, led then by President Mohamed Morsi.Now, the evidence is clear, the world and America are now less safe than they were almost eight years ago.Here with reaction, 2016 presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. By the way, a new Rasmussen national poll out today shows he is beating Hillary Clinton 43 to 39.Mr. Trump, good to see you. I bet that poll makes you pretty happy.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It does. I think the message is getting across both on terrorism and on trade, two very important subjects for me, and I think the message is really getting across.I was in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia. We're going up to New Hampshire. I mean, we're all over the place, and I will tell you the crowds are incredible, Sean. They're just incredible. They want something. They want help because these people are incompetent. They don't know what they're doing, and I think they're just grossly incompetent.HANNITY: Let me -- let me go through the list that I just labeled here. I mean, this reluctance, this resistance not to say radical Islam, but man- caused disasters, workplace violence, overseas contingency, the JV team, they're contained. How could they be so wrong so often on an issue that involves the safety and security of the American people?TRUMP: Well, you know, all you have to do is really, even on the bigger issues of -- just take a look at the Middle East, what's happened with the migration, with -- you know, maybe it started with Syria. Nobody really knows where it started. The line in the sand was a disaster. That was a disaster because if you do that, you got to produce one way or the other.But you just take a look at what's going on. Iran now is in a certain way a major power, and they certainly will be with all the money that we let them have back, $150 billion. You look at the abuse of Israel. In my opinion, he's abused Israel, and I don't think there's ever been anyone close as a president who's been more anti-Israel. And I have friends who are Jewish, who raised money for him, and they are just disgusted. They can't believe what's going on.So you know, and the people of Israel are disgusted. But you just look at failure after failure, and it started -- I guess it started a long time ago. But also not only this country allowing thousands and thousands of people into our country, who many of these people are ISIS -- I have no doubt about it. You know, I used to say, Well, maybe. Now I have no doubt about it.But also, look at what's happened with Europe. Look at what's going on with Germany and all over Europe. Europe's never going to be the same.It's so sad that the leadership in this country -- and by the way, other countries not doing so well. That's why you saw Great Britain -- you see what happened with that vote that I felt was going to happen. I had a good -- you know, a good sense of the people. I felt that was...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... and Hillary were both wrong on it, and the lobbying (ph) -- even President Obama, one of his top campaigners was actually down there trying to help Britain remain in the EU. But a lot of the things that I mentioned here -- for example, you know, the Gitmo detainees that were released or the $150 billion to Iran or the damage done in Iraq and Syria - - I don't see that that damage can be undone. If you become president, what do you do to solve those problems that they've now handed off to you?TRUMP: Well, the Gitmo detainees, they say are back -- most of them are back fighting again. So you know, what are we doing? I mean, why are we doing it? As you know, these are the people that they want the most. They want them back so badly.You almost say, Why are we doing this? And they're back out fighting. Why wouldn't we do it maybe after this all ends, if it ever ends? I mean, the way it's going right now, it's just getting worse. And ISIS is recruiting like crazy because these young kids that -- you know, they're using the internet and they're being recruited right off the internet, and they respect ISIS because it looks like ISIS -- to the outside world, it looks like ISIS is beating us and beating us badly.They need a big defeat because they are using that internet to recruit people from many countries, not just our country. And it's only going to get worse.And You know, I watched Hillary Clinton for years and years. It's the same thing. We're going to get along with our allies. We're going to work with our allies, nice and soft, nice and easy. Nothing's going to happen. And don't forget, this whole ISIS thing really started during her term.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: The Iranian deal did, too...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... detainees also. She was a part of all those decisions. She never spoke out against any one of them, which makes the world less safe.  I want to get your...HANNITY: Sean, forgetting about -- hey, Sean, forgetting about me, just forgetting about me. If she ever got in, she would be such a bad president. She would be so bad. And remember, unrelated but maybe related in a very -- you know, in a certain way, but unrelated, Supreme Court justices, so important, Supreme Court justices. But if Hillary ever got in, she would be so bad. It would be so sad.HANNITY: Listen, this is a choice election. I'm not disagreeing with you.  She's not going to build a wall. She's going to appoint liberal justices.  I don't -- she doesn't want coal to expand. You have told me you want to expand coal and fracking and drilling and nuclear technology and new technology. Those are huge differences.Also on the economy, foreign policy, building up our nation's military, fixing the VA. I think it's a choice election in many ways. You know, the biggest hack (ph) that they're making against you...TRUMP: Very big on trade, though. Sean...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: ... big on trade. You know, my message has been really from the beginning, trade. And you talk about coal, you talk about -- I really talk about the miners. The miners have just been decimated in this country.  They've been -- these are great people. And they want to be miners. They say, Why don't you move? Why don't you go to a different place? Why don't you move? Like in West Virginia, where I'm -- you know, I think I have a 25-point lead, 29-point lead.But I speak to the miners, and I see the miners. I was with them the other day. They don't want to move. They love what they do. Like you like what I -- you know, you like what you do. I like what I do. They love what they do. That's what they want to do. They want to...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Many of these are high-paying jobs, and she talked about putting all of them out of work and all the companies out of work. Here's what I want to ask you...HANNITY: She wants to put all of them out, and she wants to -- and she wants to put all of them out of work! Now, she said that five weeks before she ends up going to West Virginia. She talks to them, and she got wiped out there.But she's going to get wiped out in a lot of places. And it's not only the miners. It's steel. She doesn't want steel. Our steel is being destroyed, the industry, by China, mostly by China. We have so many industries that are absolutely on their last legs right now, and it could be turned around so easily and so fast if we're smart.HANNITY: It seems like there's a coordinated attack, the Democrats, Hillary Clinton and President Obama, and it keeps going back. They don't want to talk a lot about issues or the foreign policy record or the record on the economy, but it's always about Donald Trump and Donald Trump's temperament.I had a chance earlier this week to interview Gary Byrne. He's the former Secret Service officer that was outside the Oval Office when the Clintons were in the White House. Here's part of what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GARY BYRNE, ""CRISIS OF CHARACTER"" AUTHOR: I hope someday that it does make a difference. I mean, if Mrs. Clinton ends up being the president of the United States, then she's our president and she's the commander-in-chief, and it is what it is.But if she did become the president without me speaking the truth, I'm not sure I could -- I could deal with that. People need to know. This is serious. And her behavior is appalling. And she's two different people.I feel so strongly that people need to know the real Hillary Clinton and how dangerous she is in her behavior. She is not a leader. She is not a leader.HANNITY: She doesn't have the temperament.BYRNE: She doesn't have the temperament. She didn't have the temperament to handle the social office when she was first lady. She does not have the temperament.HANNITY: She's dishonest.BYRNE: She's dishonest. She habitually lies. Anybody that, you know, can separate themselves from their politics and review her behavior over the last...HANNITY: You're going to be accused of this being political.BYRNE: Absolutely. I'm sure I will be. I have been already.HANNITY: And what's your answer?BYRNE: It's not. It's got nothing to do with politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, he described a woman that was -- that threw a bible at the head of a Secret Service officer, told him to F off, told him to go to hell, a person that threw a vase across the residence, gave Bill Clinton a black eye.They question your temperament. Here's firsthand experience, and the media seems to ignore it. Your reaction?TRUMP: Well, I saw that interview, and I guess I'm not that surprised. I mean, I understand what I'm dealing with here, and I'm also dealing with a media that's extremely unfriendly, and they probably won't pick very much of it up, if anything.But I actually watched that, and I said to myself -- and you know, again, not being too surprised. But I said to myself, Hey, that's the way it would be. I mean, that's the way it would be.And she brings up temperament because she understands temperament because her temperament is terrible. And you know, I'll tell you what. In one way, we need a different temperament in the White House because we have had these weak leaders that let the world take advantage of us.They let ISIS continue to go forward, and it's like, you know, they don't want to do what they have to do, like get rid of their source of wealth, which is largely oil. And also by the way, coming in from many of our so- called allies, tremendous wealth goes to -- as you know, goes to ISIS through our allies, where they're paying ISIS money, which is horrible if you think about it. It's horrible. I guess it's almost like protection money. They're paying for protection.But you know, we need a strong temperament. We need somebody that's going to get in there, knock the hell out of ISIS, get ISIS out. There are ways to do it, and we can do it quickly. But we don't seem to want to do it.  And we have a president that won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism.""And he comes up with all -- at the beginning of your show, I heard you reading different names that nobody has ever even heard about. They won't use radical Islam. They won't talk about it.HANNITY: Let me ask you...TRUMP: And I shamed her into do it, but so far -- you know, she hasn't done it yet. She said, I would do it if I needed to do it, but she hasn't done it yet.HANNITY: Good point.TRUMP: If you don't say what it is, if you don't talk about radical Islam, which is what it is, then, Sean, it's...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: ... solve the problem.HANNITY: But isn't a lot of it connected to -- OK, she got up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, $10 million from Saudi Arabia for the Clinton Foundation. I mean, they treat women horribly. Women can't drive. Women are told how to dress. Women are given permission to go to school or work.  Gays are executed under Saudi law in some of the other countries. You know, they wouldn't let you build a Christian church or a Jewish temple.  And so they persecute gays and lesbians, women, Christians and Jews.She takes their money, and nobody in the media seems to focus on that, either, and claims to be the champions of those groups' rights.TRUMP: She should give that money back, all of it. She should give all of that money back. That money should go back where it came from. You have not only Saudi Arabia, you have many countries where, I mean, they execute gays. They enslave women. And she's taking money, and nobody talks about it.It's sort of an amazing thing. Can you imagine if I took that money?HANNITY: Yes, I think it would be a pretty big issue.TRUMP: Wouldn't be pretty.HANNITY: I think...TRUMP: Wouldn't be pretty.HANNITY: And by the way...TRUMP: But she should really...HANNITY: ... if it said on your teleprompter ""sigh"" and you read ""sigh"" when you were supposed to go -- I mean, did you see -- did you say that -- let me play the video for you because it's pretty entertaining.(END VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FMR. SEC. OF STATE, PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: So all he can do is try to distract us. That's even why he's attacking my faith. Sigh.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Can you imagine if you're the one -- she's that programmed that they actually put in how she should act after she gives a line. I don't know what -- if you did it, it would be -- it would be a bigger story.TRUMP: They thought it was so cute, it was so wonderful. They were saying, Oh, isn't that cute? Isn't that nice? Isn't that wonderful?Can you imagine if I did it? I never notice that on teleprompter. When I do a teleprompter, they don't put ""sigh."" You're supposed to be who you are. Can you imagine ""sigh""?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: And let me tell you, I never attacked her faith. A question was asked about her faith. I said I know nothing about it. I wasn't saying that in a good way or bad. I really know nothing about her faith.HANNITY: Well, it's an honest answer.TRUMP: I would never attack her faith.HANNITY: When we come back, I want to ask you about...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: ... let that be clear.HANNITY: I want to ask you about Benghazi, also Bill Clinton meeting Loretta Lynch on the tarmac at an airport and was that unethical? And now does Loretta Lynch need to recuse herself from the Clinton server scandal issue?We'll get to that and more as we continue with Donald Trump tonight on ""Hannity.""(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity"" as we continue with 2016 presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.So the Benghazi report finally came in this week. To me, there's three separate issues. There's the before, during and after. Now, there were over 600 requests for security before this attack. The Red Cross, Great Britain had pulled out of the area because it was unsafe. Those requests were all denied. Some went directly to Hillary Clinton.Then during the attack, if you were president, I really can't imagine -- they were debating four hours in, even though they had a live shot of the firefight that was going on on the ground. They're debating whether or not we can send our military in without getting Libya's permission, number one.  And they kept having our military men and women change their clothes because they were -- they didn't want to offend the Libyans if our military went in to save American lives in uniform.How would you have -- and then the lie afterwards, which I'll get to in a second. How would you have handled that if you were watching in real time Americans under fire at the American consulate, an ambassador under fire?TRUMP: Well, it would have never taken place because I think the key is the first little segment that you mentioned or the first set that you mentioned where, they were sending, I heard, up to 600, like, help messages.HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: I don't know how they were sending them, but they were there because they've all been accounted for.HANNITY: In the lead-up to the attack...TRUMP: Unlike her e-mails -- unlike her 33,000 e-mails, they've all been accounted for. And I wonder what is on those e-mails having to do with Benghazi, as an example.But to me, the most important segment is that first -- you know, that first grouping of 600 requests for help that, There's something going on here, we need help. And there was no response.Now, if you did that, there would have been, you know, a skirmish. The ambassador, everybody, they would have been OK. Probably they would have stopped it. They would have stopped it before it started.Once it started, the timeline was tough, but you certainly would have sent somebody in anyway, regardless. It was probably too late by that time because it wasn't -- it didn't take that long, and it would have taken people a long time to get there.HANNITY: It went on for 13 hours.TRUMP: But I will -- I will tell you this. If you would have responded to the earlier requests for help, which should have been natural -- who wouldn't have done that? -- then there would have been no problem in the first place. So that would have been the thing. That was the biggest mistake of the group. The rest was just horribly handled, horrible leadership. She's a horrible leader.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Would you have debated the idea of asking permission to send in our military people? Would you have debated what clothes they wear?TRUMP: No.HANNITY: You would have sent them in, right?TRUMP: Bernie -- Bernie Sanders said loud and clear that Hillary Clinton has bad judgment, OK? Now, who wouldn't have sent help after you got the first messages? Who wouldn't have sent help? Bernie Sanders said very loud and very clear that she has bad judgment. And you look at all of her calls. I mean, look at the calls she's made over the years. She has horrible judgment, including the fact that she voted for the war in Iraq, which I was opposed to, by the way, even though I was a civilian. Nobody cared. But listen, she has bad judgment!(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: He's asking for help, and we don't send it!HANNITY: These are Americans under fire. Then afterwards, you know, she writes her daughter. She talks to the Libyan president, the Egyptian prime minister. To her daughter, for example, she sent an e-mail that says, Two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Qaeda-like group, the ambassador, whom I hand-picked, a young communications officer on temporary duty with a wife and two very young children. Very hard day, and I fear more of the same tomorrow.So she admitted to the Libyan president, the Egyptian prime minister and her own daughter this was a terrorist attack. Simultaneously, she was telling the American people a different story, that it was not a terror attack, that it was a YouTube-related event that inspired this -- you know, it was spontaneous. They just happened to have mortars in their back pocket.TRUMP: She lied. She lied. That's what she does. She lies.HANNITY: Why do you think people don't pay as much attention to that?TRUMP: Well, I think if you did it, if I did it, if somebody else did it, it would be a big deal. But she gets away with a lot of things.I mean they -- I have events -- I'll tell you -- like, the press is very dishonest. I have events that are so good, where such good things comes out of them, and some of the media try and make it look bad. And yet she gets away with things like this.And I'll be honest. The whole Benghazi thing, Sean -- you talk about it and a lot of the Fox people talk about it. But outside of Fox, Benghazi has never resonated. It's never been a big subject. The mainstream media has not covered it like it should have been covered. But it hasn't resonated...HANNITY: Four Americans died!(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: ... it's hard to believe.HANNITY: And it's hard to believe.TRUMP: I know, but...HANNITY: Let me -- let me ask you this.TRUMP: But it has not -- it has not been a big subject, relatively speaking, for the mainstream media. They have not covered it. It has not resonated. It should have, but it hasn't.HANNITY: Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton while she potentially is weighing an indictment against his wife. Now, she claims that, you know, she boarded the plane. She was on the plane with Bill Clinton for 30 minutes. They were talking about their grandchildren and sports.Is this an issue where you think the credibility -- for example, if a criminal referral comes from the FBI, do you think the attorney general needs to now recuse herself?TRUMP: Well, when I first heard that yesterday afternoon, I actually thought they were joking. I thought the people that told me were -- you know, I said, No way. There's no way that's going to happen. And it happened. And I am just -- I'm flabbergasted by it. I think it's amazing.  I've never seen anything like that before.HANNITY: We'll have more with Donald Trump right after the break.And coming up, President Obama once again takes a shot at Donald Trump.  We'll get his reaction.Plus, more on the political firestorm brewing over Loretta Lynch's private meeting with Bill Clinton. Even Democrats are now saying it was wrong.That and more tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity,"" and this is the final part of our interview from earlier today with 2016 presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.You gave a speech in Maine, and you said elites created globalization and the average citizen has suffered. You said the trade deficit, $746 billion last year. I noticed that some of the analysis says that you are a protectionist. You dispute that by saying, No, I want free trade, but I want fair trade. What is the difference?TRUMP: Yes. I want to make good deals for the United States. Very simple. You know, somebody said, What's your trade policy? I said, I want to make good deals for the United States. I know all about fair trade, about free trade. I know every -- I could name nine other names that we have for trade.I want to make good deals for the people of this country. I want to bring back our jobs. I want to bring back our wealth. Our wealth is being sapped. Soon we will owe $21 trillion as a nation. We have massive deficits.We have tremendous trade deficits with nations. I mean, China is over $500 billion. We have massive trade deficits with these nations. And all I want to do is take these bad trade deals and make them good.And then I get hit even from my side that -- you know, what is wrong with saying we have a bad deal with China? I want to make it a good deal. I'm not saying I don't want to trade with them. I want to make it a good deal.  I will make it a good deal.People are sort of saying, like, Oh, that's a terrible thing to say. I am a free trader. You know that. But to have free trade, we need smart people. We don't have smart people negotiating our deals. We don't have smart leadership. We have political hacks negotiating the biggest deals in the world.These trade deals are bigger than company deals, bigger than anything. And all I'm saying is I want to make great trade deals. I don't want to make bad ones like we have right now because our jobs have been taken. They've moved to Mexico. They've moved to different places. It's disgraceful.HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: And so what I want to do is renegotiate trade deals so they're good, so our jobs come back, so they don't take our jobs anymore. We will have a country that will be so strong again. But right now, we're a laughingstock all over the world!HANNITY: Let me give you an opportunity. The president attacked you again and claimed that you are xenophobic and that you're appealing to nativism.  And he even went on to say funny-looking people. Let me play it for you, give you a chance to respond.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Somebody else who has never shown any regard for workers, has never fought on behalf of social justice issues and making sure that poor kids are getting a decent shot in life or have health care, in fact, have worked against economic opportunity for workers and ordinary people -- they don't suddenly become a populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes. That's not the measure of populism. That's nativism or xenophobia, or worse. Or it's just cynicism.What is absolutely true is that the ability to tap into a fear that people may have about losing control and to offer some sort of vague, nostalgic feelings about how, you know, we'll make Britain great again or we'll make America great again, and the subtext for that is somehow that a bunch of foreigners and funny-looking people are coming in here and changing the basic character of the nation.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: So my question to you is he's claiming he's the populist, not you. But his record is clear. Right now in America, we have since he's been president, 12 million more people on food stamps, in poverty. We have the lowest labor participate rate since the early '70s. He's doubled the national debt. He said $9 trillion was irresponsible and unpatriotic. One in five American families don't have a single member of their family in the workforce. When you look at that abysmal record, Americans are suffering under his economic policies. Then he tries to attack you with those words.  What's your answer to him?TRUMP: So, Sean, I've created tens of thousands of jobs throughout my career, tens of thousands. And so many people so happy. They love Donald trump. I mean, you know, their education for their family and health care for their families, and they were able to afford all of this. So I've created tens of thousands of jobs.If I ever used the word ""funny-looking people"" or whatever the phrase he used, it would be a headline all over the world. With him, nobody even mentions it, you know, working with funny-looking people or they come into the country. If I ever said that, I will tell you, it would be headlines all over the world. With him -- I saw him say that. I said, oh, that's a bad -- that's a bad term in a world of political correctness, which is ridiculous in itself. And nobody even mentioned that.Look, we are going to make America strong again. We're going to bring back our jobs. We're going to bring back our wealth. We're going to pay down debt. We're going to get rid of our deficit or largely get rid of it but ultimately get rid of it. And we are going to have a strong country again.Our military is totally depleted. We're using parts for airplanes. We're using parts for our jet fighters that come out of airplane graveyards and museums because the planes are so old. And we're not going to have that anymore. We're going to have great equipment. We're going to have a strong military again. Our military is so depleted. That's all everybody is talking about that's in the military services. We're going to make our country strong again, rich again. We're going to make our country great again.HANNITY: All right, Mr. Trump. As always, thank you for being with us.  Appreciate your time.TRUMP: Thank you.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And coming up, so why did the attorney general Loretta Lynch meet privately with Bill Clinton at the Phoenix airport while the FBI is still investigating e-mail server scandal? We'll check in with Jay Sekulow, Doug Schoen, and Peter Johnson Jr.Also, according to a new report, the FBI is telling local law enforcement agencies not to release records related to the Orlando terror attack. Now, is this an attempt to hide the truth? We'll check in with Dr. Sebastian Gorka and Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters. That's next tonight straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So earlier this week, Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with Bill Clinton aboard her plane at the Phoenix airport. Now, the meeting reportedly lasted 30 minutes. Now, this news comes as Lynch's Justice Department is in the middle of conducting a probe into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. But let not your heart be troubled. Lynch says there's nothing to worry about, nothing at all.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LORETTA LYNCH, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Our conversation was a great deal about his grandchildren. It was primarily social and about our travels.  He mentioned the golf he played in Phoenix, and he mentioned travels he had had to West Virginia. We talked about former attorney general Janet Reno, for example, whom we both know.But there was no discussion of any matter pending before the department or any matter pending before any other body. There was no discussion of Benghazi, no discussion of the State Department e-mails, by way of example.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, while Lynch is trying to make it seem like this was just a casual social meeting, well, some members of her own party think it looks pretty bad. David Axelrod took issue with the meeting, tweeting, quote, ""I take Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton at their word that their conversation in Phoenix did not touch on the probe, but foolish to create such optics.""Here with reaction is the chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice Jay Sekulow, former Clinton pollster, FOX News contributor Doug Schoen, and FOX News analyst Peter Johnson Jr. Jay, is there any legal/ethical issues here that would force her to have to recuse herself?JAY SEKULOW, CHIEF COUNSEL, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Well, yes. In fact, the Department of Justice's own guidelines in the court of federal regulations, it specifically states, let me read it, it says it prohibits a DOJ employee, that would include the attorney general, from participating in a criminal investigation or prosecution if they have a personal or a political relationship with the person or entity that's the subject of the investigation.So the fact that they had a personal conversation -- which only Bill Clinton could pull this off, by the way -- I mean just think about that, really proves the point. That means her objectivity is certainly put in question, and I think under the existing Department of Justice own regulations and guidelines, she has to recuse herself from any potential review of the case, not just the prosecution or not prosecution. She needs to be out of it now.But just think for a moment, Sean. The idea that Bill Clinton got off an airplane, walked up the steps to a plane controlled by the United States Department of Justice while his wife is under investigation by the Department of Justice through the FBI, and he may well be a witness. And let's not forget the server of the e-mails that are in question was in his house. So he's a potential witness. He could be a potential defendant.  So this whole thing is just horrendous from the beginning.HANNITY: Peter, from a legal standpoint, do you agree with that analysis and State Department rules, Justice Department rules? And, you know, Comey said this is a criminal investigation.PETER JOHNSON JR., FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, by those federal regulations, she couldn't be investigating them from the get-go. And a lot of people she couldn't investigate by virtue of a personal, political relationship.I see it a little bit differently. I think she stayed too long. She should have said, Mr. President, step off the plane. Now, I also know that she happens to be one of the most successful prosecutors in the United States and has put away a lot of bad, bad guys.HANNITY: I got a question. Are you suggesting that maybe Bill Clinton knew what he was doing, knew that this might raise ethical questions, and he wants her to recuse herself?JOHNSON: I don't know. But he's the former president of the United States. I don't think he wants her to recuse herself, and I don't think he would say to her, listen, maybe you could be on the Supreme Court if Hillary wins. I don't think he would ever say that when he went on the plane. I don't think there would be any kind of social conversation about anyone's future. But I believe her when she says there wasn't a discussion of the State Department e-mails. I happen to believe her. And I don't think --HANNITY: Could there be a wink and a nod that went on in that plane?JOHNSON: I guess there could be, but I don't think she can or should be infected with the poison that we are seeing out of this family for a long, long time.HANNITY: Doug, would you put it past Bill Clinton to purposely go on there -- it seems he knows the law. He's a former president.DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think -- I agree with Peter. I don't think that he was doing any winks or nods. I don't think he was doing anything --HANNITY: He didn't have to. He showed up.SCHOEN: He did show up. And I think Loretta Lynch should do is go to whether it be the inspector general or the ethics adviser in the Department of Justice and seek counsel, because with all due respect I don't think it's as clear as Jay says it is.HANNITY: Jay, go back to what you were citing earlier from the state department's own guidelines on this.SEKULOW: So it's code of federal regulations 45.2 and it specifically prohibits when you have a situation that the person is under investigation is a close friend of yours. And just think about that. In our ethics rules, Peter, we know that we cannot -- we have to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. So let's take it from whether they had a conversation about his golf game or anything else --(CROSSTALK)JOHNSON: I agree with you.SCHOEN: Just bad judgment by the Clintons, I'll say that.HANNITY: This is going to be interesting. And on top of that, by the way, the State Department announced they don't want to release Clinton Foundation e-mails for 27 months.JOHNSON: That's ridiculous.SCHOEN: That's good politics.HANNITY: That's bad politics. Bad policy.SCHOEN: Good politics.HANNITY: I agree with Peter. Thank you all for being with us.Coming up, according to a brand new report, the FBI is telling local law enforcement agencies to literally block the release of records in the Orlando terror attack. What are they trying to hide? That's next, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" A shocking new report from ""The Orlando Sentinel"" alleges that, quote, ""The FBI has asked law enforcement agencies to respond to Pulse nightclub to withhold records from the public according to officials."" So what is the federal government trying to hide? We reached out to the FBI. We have not yet received a response. Joining us now with reaction, the author of ""Defeating Jihad, The Winnable War,"" the distinguished chair of military theory at Marine Corps University, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, as well as the author of ""The Damned of Petersburg,"" Fox News strategic analyst Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters. Why?LT. COL. RALPH PETERS, FOX NEWS STRATEGIC ANALYST: Because it hurts the narrative. And the one thing the Obama administration will do at all costs is protect the narrative that Islam is a religion of peace. Now, it's gone into the realm of the absurd. Nobody believes it, but this is the hard left approach where you just stick to the party line. Stick to the party.And at some level I actually have sympathy with them a little bit because if they finally admit it that Islamic terrorism has something to do with Islam, the whole rationale for their foreign policy collapses. Their security policy is built on quicksand, which we know it is. And Obama's pride of course comes into it. He doesn't admit he's wrong. So it's become more important to preserve the myth than it has been to protect the American people.HANNITY: Dr. Gorka, what is your reaction to this? It seems that between Iraq and Syria and Egypt and the Russian reset and total chaos now in the Middle East and not admitting radical Islam is radical Islam, there seems to be a pathological obsession not to tell anything.DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, ""DEFEATING JIHAD"" AUTHOR: Sean, if you want to see how pathological it is, watch the video that was just posted from the Senate judiciary this week. Senator Cruz asked the director of the DHS, why are there in more mentions of the word ""jihad"" in DHS documents? Why have official training manuals been scrubbed? It's exactly as Colonel Peters says. There is a narrative that has to be maintained at all costs, Sean.HANNITY: Let me play what year referring to so our viewers can see it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: Was Mr. Haney's testimony that the Department of Homeland Security ordered over 800 documents in CBB altered or deleted, was that testimony accurate?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no idea.CRUZ: And when the United States Senate judiciary oversight committee conducted a hearing on that, did you or anyone on your staff inquire into those issues?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, but you have me to right here right now to ask questions of.CRUZ: But apparently your answer is you don't know. Your testimony to this full committee now is that you have no idea and apparently no intention of finding out whether the DHS materials have been scrubbed.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Dr. Gorka, they're talking about a number of things there, scrubbing the word ""radical Islam"" and ""sharia"" from testimony. And Phil Haney testified that he was one of the founding members of the Department of Homeland security. As soon as Obama became president, they were told to scrub and delete the names that they'd accumulated of Muslims with radical connections which puts us all of us at risk.GORKA: Absolutely. So it's important to understand two things are coming together, Sean. It's what Ralph just mentioned. The house of cards policies of the United States that have helped engender the creation of ISIS. It is a narrative that must be maintained at all costs.And then you just saw the director of homeland security ooze arrogance that he's not going to answer this. I wouldn't know Phil Haney if he walked into the room is what he said. If you add the arrogance to the fantasyland narrative, we are in danger, Sean, and this administration will not admit it, and that is why those transcripts will not be released.HANNITY: And Colonel Peters, just like they won't release the video of the night of Benghazi, they scrubbed Sharia, the scrubbed radical Islam, but more importantly, they put Americans at risk by scrubbing names of Muslims with radical ties, just like they're putting us at risk by taking in refugees when we know ISIS will infiltrate that population. Why are they willing to gamble with the lives of Americans?PETERS: Because the idea is more important than the flesh and blood reality, the theology of the left, if you will, is. And I'm so sick of this, Sean. As Dr. Gorka knows well and has explained many times to many people, and explained well, you can say many things about Islam. It's complex. It's various. But you can't say it's a religion of peace. For those of us in the Christian tradition, the foundation stone is the Sermon on the Mount. For Islam, the foundation is the tribal conquest of mecca that puts Mohammed in charge. Jihad isn't peaceful. Jihad is militant, usually violent, and it has never stopped for almost 1,400 years.HANNITY: And Sharia is oppressive.PETER: Sharia is law for illiterate Bedouins.HANNITY: Wow. All right, thank you both for being with us.When we come back, we need your help. A very important ""Question of the Day"" straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right, time for our ""Question of the Day."" Now, should the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, recuse herself from the Clinton e-mail server investigation? I think so. You can't be meeting with the woman's husband on the tarmac and tell us, oh, we're just talking about grandkids for a half-hour. Anyway, go to Facebook and Twitter, let us know what you think.Quick programming note. Be sure to tune in tomorrow night, ""Fox & Friends"" tomorrow morning, 8:00 a.m., country music super star Trace Adkins, he will be performing in the summer concert series.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On the Buzz Meter this Sunday, Donald Trump getting hammered by the media for his comments on Muslims, and what he says happened on 9/11, for appearing to mock a disabled reporter, and for the rockets he fires off on Twitter.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)BILL O'REILLY: Are you aware that the liberal media and the Democratic Party in general are trying to paint you as a racist. Are you aware of that?DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think so, but I think people know better than that.VAN JONES: You have a political candidate, your candidate, who you come on night after night and defend no matter what despicable, horrible, un-American, racist, inflammatory thing he said.This is demagoguery. It is dangerous. And somebody's going to go hurt some Muslim as a result of this kind of hatred.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: This as the New York Times and the Washington Post denounced Trump as a racist, a liar, and a bully, and a top editor of the Daily Beast calls for a boycott of his businesses. Are Trump's journalistic critics going too far?Chris Christie on the media of the coverage, his new focus on -- and whether his campaign is making a comeback.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS CHRISTIE, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am not this for a book deal or a Fox News show. I am in this to win President of the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: President Obama getting skewered for saying that the media needs to show perspective on covering ISIS. Is that unfair?Plus, the author of a no. 1 best-seller on George Bush 41 says he once thought the former president was kinda like this guy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DANA CARVEY AS PRESIDENT BUSH: Let me just sum up, on track, stay the course, 1,000 points of light. Stay the course.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Jon Meacham on journalists -- and he pleads guilty here -- rushing to judgment. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is ""MediaBuzz.""The New York Times editorial page is accusing Donald Trump of peddling racist lies. The Washington Post says he's running an ugly campaign and the only way to beat a bully is to stand up to him. And that's just the beginning. Trump spoke of seeing thousands of people in New Jersey cheering as the twin towers came down. No one has found any evidence of that. The Washington Post gave him four Pinocchio's, but Trump claimed vindication after finding a 2001 story from that paper, saying the far east were questioning several people in New Jersey for allegedly holding parties on roof tops on 9/11.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: But fortunately somebody in the Washington Post wrote that and they'll try to deny it. They'll probably say we made a mistake. I like that better, because then I could show you how dishonest they are, but they'll find some reason to deny it. They'll call it a typo.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us now to examine the impact of the media assault on Trump, Matt Lewis, Senior Contributor at the Daily Caller and a Columnist for the Week. Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the Washington Examiner, and Simon Rosenberg, President of the New Democratic Network. Let's do a lightning round here. Matt Lewis, do you think the New York Times, Washington Post and other media outlets calling Trump a racist, a liar, a bully, has any impact on his campaign.MATT LEWIS, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR AT THE DAILY CALLER: No. I think they're right, and I think he is lying, but I don't think it matters. Because I think that it actually maybe helps Trump. The people who support Trump think the -- it's a back lash against political correctness. This plays into his hands actually.KURTZ: So my next question to you, can there be a backlash on the media's part? And can that actually end up helping Trump?SIMON ROSENBERG, PRESIDENT OF THE NEW DEMOCRATIC NETWORK: Possible, but the evidence so far is Trump is having a hard time growing beyond this core base he has. If he's going to be President, he's got to get moderate Republicans, Democrats, and you look at head-to-head polling with Hillary Clinton right now, and he's doing the worst. There is evidence it may by working to fire up his troops, but not working with the broader electorate that he needs to win the election.KURTZ: Susan Ferrechio, let me read a couple of tweets that are put up by Noah Shatman, the Executive Editor of the Daily Beast. Another one six month ago, 8,000 racist moments later -- I guess that's an exact number -- that's no longer feasible -- a top editor at a website calling for a boycott.SUSAN FERRECHIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT FOR THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Some probably love that tweet.KURTZ: Why so?FERRECHIO: Because it's a liberal-leaning kind of online publication. That's who they attract, who they want to be logging on and reading. It's quick bait, as they say, but you know, it's migrating from journalism into activism, so you have to question he's running the Daily Beast and now he's calling for somebody who's staying at a Trump motel. That's activism, not journalism.KURTZ: Sure smells like activism to me. This guy is obviously a top editor and Avalon, who worked for Rudy Giuliani in the past -- he's not a Trump fan, either. All right, so Trump has said repeatedly he's not backing down, that he saw thousands of Arabs in New Jersey celebrating on 9/11 on television, he says. No one else has found the footage. State official say it's not true, but he cites the paragraph about whether there was an investigation of some that he's right.LEWIS: You're entitled to your own opinion. You are not entitled to your own facts. Donald Trump, it's hard to hold him accountable, because he has this reality distortion filter. He's going to say I saw it. There are thousands of people cheering. It doesn't happen, and he is lying, and I think it's a responsibility of the media to hold politicians accountable even if they are Republican or conservative, even if liberal bias does exist.KURTZ: Simon, what except this story alive is this piece in the Washington Post, in 2001, which by the way didn't say the reporter had seen it, just an investigation that said they found nothing about this allegation. And a reporter who suffering from a congenital condition which limits the use of his arms, a great reporter and a great guy, Trump is -- and you've all seen this footage, it appeared to many people he was mocking the disability.ROSENBERG: We have discussed on air here that Donald Trump knows what he's doing and pretty talented. I think this is a huge mistake. He's kept the story alive.KURTZ: Maybe he wants to keep the story alive.ROSENBERG: Yeah, what he's been effective at is he understood he can get in trouble and the next day reports move on, and they -- there is a new news story and so it all just evaporates and goes into the collective memory of the media hole. I think he kept what was a negative story around for days, that he's not perfect. This is a mistake.KURTZ: Well, Trump says that he didn't remember -- it didn't seem he was backing off the story, and again he didn't say hundreds or thousands, some number of individuals. He really -- Trump got into it this morning with Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press."" Let's take a brief look at that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS: This didn't happen in New Jersey. There were plenty of reports, and you're...TRUMP: Chuck, it did happen in New Jersey. I have hundreds of people that agree with me.TODD: You're running for President of the United States. Your words matter. Truthfulness matters.TRUMP: Chuck, take it easy. Just play cool.(END VIDEO CLIP)FERRECHIO: I really -- I disagree. I think Trump has won this round. He's won this round. It looked like my god, he's finally gone too far. I am not sure Trump can go too far. If you look at the reaction, like what he just said, I have got all kinds of calls and tweets who reported the same thing. The people who support me say there were thousands of people. So he's winning, telling Chuck Todd to play it cool, because Chuck Todd is getting so emotional trying to get Trump on this, but he couldn't.KURTZ: Trump says he wants an apology from New York Times.FERRECHIO: That's right. He turns it back on them, punching back twice as hard.KURTZ: Do you agree in pure television terms if he's telling Chuck, calm down, or is Chuck Todd doing what journalists should do, and trying to pin him down?LEWIS: I think both. I think Chuck Todd is doing the right thing, because the problem is I think our culture has changed. It used to be -- especially if you were a family values conservative that mocking somebody with a physical deformity would be seen as beneath the dignity of somebody running for President. I don't know that our culture cares that much about it anymore.KURTZ: What about Trump -- and Bill O'Reilly chided him on this, re- tweeting reportedly bogus crimes statistics, and Trump says I can't check everything and it's a re-tweet.ROSENBERG: He's trying to change the rules.(CROSSTALK)ROSENBERG: He has already changed the rules.FERRECHIO: It's already happened.ROSENBERG: He as already changed the rules. We will know whether this experiment is effective. I still think there's a lot of evidence that it actually will not play well over time, but we'll see.KURTZ: Ben Carson initially was asked about this, did you know about Muslims in New Jersey. Not in the middle east, celebrating on 9/11. With Megyn Kelly he said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS: You admit to a lack of caution in answering that question?BEN CARSON, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yeah. I felt we were just talking about the fact that Muslims were inappropriately celebrating. I didn't know they had an agenda behind the question.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The agenda -- what he was asked -- did you see this? Yes. Did you see it in New Jersey? Yes.FERRECHIO: I thought it was fine. I thought his walk-back was final, and the biggest problem is his foreign policy experience.KURTZ: He went to Jordan this weekend, kind of shrouded in secrecy, but we do get pictures of Dr. Carson meeting with refugees and of course is on several Sunday morning shows.FERRECHIO: Sure. He needed to bolster his foreign policy credentials. To connect that with Trump, we spend all this time playing gotcha with the media with Trump and not nailing him down on substance. He is the front- runner, and we're net doing that.KURTZ: Just briefly, the terrible shooting in Colorado, three people dead, one a police officer. First liberal Huffington Post and now the Washington Post questioning why only three Republican candidates put on any statements, first Ted Cruz and later Jeb Bush and John Kasich. Any statements regardless of what are your views on abortion, expressing sympathy for the victims. Is that a fair point to draw out?LEWIS: They're running for President. I think it would be quicker.FERRECHIO: Just say, I am real sorry about what happened. These candidates are very concerned. It's treacherous, on Meet the Press this morning Donald Trump was asked about it over and over where I believe Chuck Todd tried to connect his favoritism of the videos with perhaps this outcome in Colorado, and he wouldn't do it. I think that's what these other candidates are worried about.KURTZ: It's always dangerous with if politicians that doesn't spout been that leads to violence.Let me get a break here. You can email us, and ahead, Chris Christie on one pundit's conclusion that he's battled his way back to respectability.But when we come back, conservative commentators hammering President Obama saying the press needs to show some perspective in covering the war on terror.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: President Obama's taking some heat, especially on Fox, for these comments about how terrorism should be covered.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The media needs to help in this. I just want to say it, but one of the things that have to happen is how we report on this has to maintain perspective and not -- you know, empower in any way these terrorist organizations or elevate them in ways that make it easier to them to recruit or make them stronger.O'REILLY: So therefore we should play down these stories? Really come on, what do you say?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: He hit the bottom of the barrel.LOU DOBBS, FBN: President Obama now sounding more like a community organizer than a commander in chief, as he tries to defend his approach by blaming the media for the disastrous results of his policies. Mr. Obama tried to blame the media for empowering the Islamic state.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Matt, do you think President Obama was blaming the media or saying...LEWIS: Not at all. I think it's an overreaction and twisting what it sounded like he said to me. First of all, the media has been known to stoke fear. If all I did was watch the news, I wouldn't leave the house, they also glamorize occasionally villains. We saw that with the Boston bomber on the cover of the Rolling Stone. He's encouraging them to be responsible, what's wrong with that?KURTZ: White House official told me that of course, these organizations was going to make their own judgments, but the President was commenting on whether people are fearful of another terrorist attack. It's no question that it feels like the press went way over on a few cases of Ebola.FERRECHIO: I think our job is to cover events truthfully, accurately, nothing more. You can't listen to a President tell you to alter or shape your coverage. Our role is to cover it as we see it. Obviously, the news has been focused on terrorism, on his foreign policy, and it's been unflattering for him. I think that's why he's talking about changing the coverage.KURTZ: Perhaps, but when there are days and days of coverage whether there will be an attack over thanksgiving weekend, no credible evidence, cite the authorities. Would it have been the same media coverage if George W. Bush had asked media not to scare people?ROSENBERG: Or the color-coded system? I think what he's reminding is that the goal of terror is to scare people, and to leverage the fear to make it -- to make a single attack in Paris even more consequential all throughout the world, and to have perspective. He's reminding everybody we have to make sure we understand -- look, we've had three times as many Americans in mass shootings as died in the Paris attacks, so making sure we understand the relative strength of the attack and not exaggerate is a fair -- I think a responsible thing.KURTZ: We debate this all the time and all the volume we use. Thank you all for being here, Simon Rosenberg, Susan Ferrechio, and Matt Lewis.Up next, James Rosen on whether the media's coverage from the Paris attacks differs from the atmosphere during the Bush/Cheney administration.And later, even the snarky website Gawker is getting into campaign coverage, does that meet gossip is over?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: James Rosen was talking around the office about the coverage of the recent terror attacks and whether it resembled what went on during the Bush/Cheney administration. So we had a conversation prompting in part by his book Cheney one on one, a candid conversation with America's most controversial statesman.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: James Rosen, welcome.JAMES ROSEN, AUTHOR: Thank you, Howie, great to be with you.KURTZ: In the wake of 9/11, Dick Cheney was going on the television. But here's the media question -- in the coverage now, do you see echoes of that period after 9/11?ROSEN: Sure. There's always of course, the objectivity question that circulated in 9/11, and now. One difference I see between the debates then about coverage and today's debates, we used to wrestle with whether or not to show the latest video message from Osama Bin Laden. That has by and large been decided, no, we'll just show still photographs and that sort of thing, but now that decision has been rendered moot, by the media where you can find the gruesome videos.KURTZ: So the media's gatekeeper is done, the people can see it more readily. And the press, could we be objective, meaning was there fervor in the country, or fear, then/now, for those who want to march to war?ROSEN: And that is a tough line for journalists is it not? Journalists like to maintain a pose whereby they are disinterested. Whichever horse hears the race, as long as it's an exciting race to cover. But when the story is the fate of your own nation, when it's come under devastating terrorist attack, that's a hard one to maintain interest in the outcome.KURTZ: Of course, the goal then is to at least have a multiplicity of voices on the debate. So I remember these great media debates a decade ago, about every increase in chatter, versus concern about are we unnecessarily scaring people? Do you see that -- are we still walking that tight rope?ROSEN: We are, but first quarter, I recently did a story for a special report about Bret Baier that new alert system five years ago, and guess what we found when we looked at it? That new system hasn't given the American people one single alert. There are no tweets on this advisory Twitter page, for example. So the question becomes -- is the government sometimes doing too little to keep Americans informed?KURTZ: Right, but back in those days, when the memories of 9/11 were so fresh, you know, every approaching of a holiday or major sports event there had be new possible terror alert, and most of those have turned out to be false alarms. The Paris attacks were a wake-up call about the evil capability of ISIS. My question is, is there a danger now, as then, that we unwittingly serve as a conduit for propaganda if we are constantly peppering people with story alerts that could frighten them.ROSEN: Here's the bottom line. We report the news. If ISIS issues a threat in a video, we report it, but then you go to the authorities, and the FBI and DHS says there had no credible threat. So you report them both, we report and let the viewers decide.KURTZ: That sounds suspiciously like a slogan. In the seconds we have remaining, what was your takeaway from spending all these hours with Dick Cheney, who still speaks out quite frequently against the Obama administration?ROSEN: If you love or hate Dick Cheney, you're going to love this book. I spent ten hours with the man across three days, and I have never heard him open up the way he did in these ten hours, about his childhood, his spiritual faith in Christ, the Presidents and foreign leaders he's worked with, and 9/11 and Iraq, where he was very candid in admitting some mistakes to me.KURTZ: James Rosen thanks very much for joining.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Tweets are pouring about our discussion about Donald Trump and the media. Terry Kershaw I think there maybe a stupidity bias and honesty bias.All right coming up, my sit-down with Chris Christie on whether the press is being fares in covers the Syrian refugee crisis, and his attempted campaign comeback.And later, how on earth did author John Meacham get George Bush to open up to him and share his private diaries?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Some of the pundits were starting to write off Chris Christie, but the campaigns new focus on terrorism is starting to change his media narrative. And just today he got the coveted endorsement of the New Hampshire Union Leader, the New Jersey Governor sat down here in Studio One.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Chris Christie, welcome.CHRIS CHRISTIE, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Happy to be here.KURTZ: Front page of the New York Times this week -- Christie's -- are you willing to acknowledge a new respect for the newspaper's fairness and judgment?CHRISTIE: No, sir.KURTZ: Said nice things about you.CHRISTIE: They did. I think they're finally reporting it accurately.KURTZ: Could it be said that you are in some fashion playing on the fears aroused by the Paris attacks?CHRISTIE: No, it's acknowledges fears. I was in New Hampshire this weekend. My town hall meeting, every question was on national security.KURTZ: So for somebody running for high office, you have to just acknowledge them, but address them?CHRISTIE: Absolutely.KURTZ: As Governor you said you don't want any Syrian refugees in New Jersey. This is a very emotional issue, do you think the pressure approach to this issue has balanced or are the media largely portraying people like you as heartless?CHRISTIE: The latter. They have no responsibility for protecting the lives of the people of New Jersey or this country. My test is very simple. The FBI director has said before congress there's no effective way to vet these people. That's the beginning and end of the conversation for me because American national security and homeland security has to be first and foremost.KURTZ: Over any humanitarian concerns?CHRISTIE: Yes, sir.KURTZ: There is no question that the Paris attacks changed the tone of this campaign. Ted Cruz wants to only admit Christian refugees. Is that a problem?CHRISTIE: It is a problem. The problem is we shouldn't be admitting any.KURTZ: You don't even get to the religious question.CHRISTIE: I don't.KURTZ: One of Ben Carson's foreign policy says he doesn't know about the Middle East. Is that a problem for Ben Carson?CHRISTIE: Sure.KURTZ: You can expand if you want.CHRISTIE: You want quick answers, you better be ready to answer these questions.KURTZ: Does Donald Trump go too far with some of his harsh rhetoric?CHRISTIE: Of course he does, but Donald goes too far on anything. So this is not something that anybody should be surprised with. That's the way Donald speaks, that's the way he's always spoken, whether he's firing somebody on the Apprentice or whether he's running for President.KURTZ: I would ask a broader question. It seems you are going out of your way not to criticize your Republican rivals, understandably you're keeping your ammunition trained on Hillary Clinton and President Obama, but I wonder if it's because you feel like maybe I have an outside shot of winning the nomination and I don't want to rough anybody else.CHRISTIE: No, it's because I want to beat Hillary Clinton. That's the adversary we have to beat to get to the White House.KURTZ: But for you to face off against Hillary Clinton, you have a lot of other people in this race in your party that you have to beat. It seems to some people -- you're a bit of a political brawler, but like you're pulling punches.CHRISTIE: No, sometimes you need the driver, and sometimes you need the pitching wedge. That's called strategy. It's not called pulling your punches.KURTZ: What's your strategy?CHRISTIE: To make myself the person that the people in the Republican Party trust the most to beat Hillary Clinton.KURTZ: But inevitably it's a game of compare and contrast. So would you say you're passing up opportunities to take on some of the people who are way ahead of you in the polls right now?CHRISTIE: No, I don't think so. While people are standing on the stage, they don't need you to do it for them.KURTZ: I have heard you talk about the executive experience of governor. Is it frustrating, three out of race, most running at 3 percent or 5 percent, is it frustrating for you that voters seem not to place a high value on having run a state?CHRISTIE: No, it's pollees. There are no voters yet. No will vote until February 1st in Iowa caucus.KURTZ: So you're saying politicians tend to love polls when they're in the top tier.CHRISTIE: Sure. They love polls when they're in first. I understand that, but the fact is everyone will acknowledge that 60 percent to 70 percent of the people polled say they will or could change their mind. So I am not too worried about that. I am still in the mind changing business.KURTZ: Chris Lizza said you have fought your way back to respectable.CHRISTIE: No, my goal is to win. I think I have always been respectable. I appreciate his left-handed compliment, but I think our campaign has always been issue-driven and competitive. I am not in this for a book deal or Fox News show. I am in this to win and be President of the United States.KURTZ: Of course, thank you very much for joining us.CHRISTIE: I appreciate it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: That Union Leader endorsement used to be huge in New Hampshire, but keep in mind only a couple of the politicians backed by the paper or Republicans I should have ended up winning the nomination.After the break, former Newsweek Editor John Meacham on why he and other journalists love to kick around Presidents, and how he changed his mind after spending time with George Herbert Walker Bush.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: John Meacham made plenty of news with his biography, and in the former Newsweek Editor get the -- we sat down with the author of Destiny in Power, the American odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: John Meacham, welcome.JOHN MEACHAM, FORMER NEWSWEEK EDITOR: Thank you.KURTZ: The media verdict on George H.W. Bush at the time, great job with the Gulf War, broke the no in talks pledge, therefore failed President, and was that short sighted by the media?MEACHAM: Not short-sighted by the media,KURTZ: Did that feel that way to you at the time?MEACHAM: Sure. I had sort of the Dana Carvey view of him in my head. It was only after meeting hem and then the passage of time we can come to better historical judgment. There's a rule that it takes 20 to 25 years after an administration that you can judge it whole. I think that's true.KURTZ: From your book, 1987 Newsweek eluded to rumors that he an affair by a longtime aide. George W. Bush asked his dad about the rumors and then did what?MEACHAM: He called Howard Fineman, Evan Thomas, and the answer to the big- A is NO, and that shut it down.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: But his parents...MEACHAM: Mrs. Bush was apparently angry or upset. She thought that it would feed the story. Then Vice President Bush said in his diary that he worried that Barbara was right, but the parents was wrong. It put the story to rest.KURTZ: Given that Bush's '92 unofficial slogan was annoy the media, reelect Bush, but before you got there, 1987 ran that famous cover, calling him a wimp. How did you persuade Bush 41 to give all these interviews and share the documents?MEACHAM: Good question. I found him to be a much more complicated and interesting figure. My argument to him was that this was my book-writing part of my life. You're a multi-tasker too, you know this. There was a lot of question, because I was coming from the republic of Newsweek...KURTZ: What would you have done if you had wanted to take back or asked you not to use some of what he said?MEACHAM: I was simply going to note parenthetically that whatever response he had had.KURTZ: Give him the chants to revise or...MEACHAM: Just extend.KURTZ: In some of the reaction for some of the -- there was perhaps an implication that you, in interviewing a man who's now 91 years old perhaps took advantage of him. How do you feel about that?MEACHAM: I don't think there's any trust to that, whatever. He made these comments in '08. Anyone who knew George Bush knew in 2008 he was firing on all pistons. So I think this accurately reflects his view of Cheney, Brumsfeld and his son's rhetoric.KURTZ: (Inaudible) that you fall in love with your subjects?MEACHAM: Sure. That was my great worry about doing a living President, was that I wouldn't be able to throw a punch.KURTZ: A very charming guy in his life.MEACHAM: Yes, any President there's a charm there. But part of the ethos he created, which was make the historical judgments, I found it easier, much easier than I expected to say what I thought.KURTZ: Isn't it also true that we as journalists who have daily deadlines, minute by minute Twitter deadlines often rush to judgments about Presidents, politics based on incomplete information?MEACHAM: Oh my god, yes, that's the reflex to kick them in the shins. It's I think one of the perils of journalism right now. Everyone's a journalist, right? Just because we have the ability to speak all the time doesn't mean we always have something worth saying. That's a discipline that all of us should impose more often.TRUMP: You're speaking at somebody who is perhaps a reformed sinner?MEACHAM: Not reformed. Absolutely a sinner on this, but one of the interesting things was seeing how this culture was taking shape in the Bush 41 years. But CNN's political talk shows are growing. Rush Limbaugh is becoming more of a force. Limbaugh endorses Pat Buchanan, so what does Bush do? He actually invites Limbaugh over to the White House to spend the night, and carries a suitcase for him. That shut down Limbaugh. Suddenly Limbaugh was introducing Bush at campaign events. But the 24-hour cycle really was -- and his diary is full of remarks about how the press drives him crazy. Any President who says they don't read the notices is not telling the truth.TRUMP: John Meacham thanks very much for joining us.MEACHAM: Thanks, Howie.(END VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Next on MediaBuzz, Gawker dropping the gossip to cover the 2016 campaign and going after other Donald Trump and other Republican candidates. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Gawker, which pioneered a more steaming level of online gossip, is now reverting itself as a political website to define the deeper meaning here (Inaudible).(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Lola Oguinnaike, does Gawker getting out of the media and cultural gossip business mean that gossip is now -- very 2009.LOLA OGUINNAIKE, ARISE TV ANCHOR: It does mean that gossip is 2009, but it also mean that's the election is far more interesting than anything else happening in the media landscape today. So of course, they've decided to throw their hat into the election ring because what bigger story is there than election 2016?KURTZ: It's huge, to quote somebody part of that campaign.OGUINNAIKE: I think I know that guy.KURTZ: Gawker specialized in snark. It pledged to become 20 percent nicer when it apologized outing a executive. Do you think that's a factor in this evolution to politics?AMY ARGETSINGER, WASHINGTON POST STYLE SECTION EDITOR: Snark is not going away. This is what internet content was built on over the past 10 or 12 years, however it's gotten harder to make money off of snark. Social media has changed the dynamic. People may love to read bitchy news stories, but they want to look like nice people as far as what they share. That's why you saw the rise of all these inspirational stories, puppy videos, and things like that. So Gawker is basically doubling down on the one area where it's still ok to be snarky, where it's still profitable to be snarky, and that's politics.KURTZ: Lola, thanks to Twitter and Snapchat and a million blogs it seems like gossip, snark whatever you want to call is everywhere. Is there less of a market niche for it?OGUINNAIKE: Snark is ubiquitous and you can thank Gawker for that. But people do want to be liked. They're concerned with their followers, and what is more likely to generate more likes, more followers, posting or forwarding or making something perceived as nice go viral. There's not big business in people individually being seen as mean or as bullies.ARGETSINGER: The exception, of course, is with political coverage, political stories because that's where you see people really forming these tribal identities on Facebook where you will still see people getting into big fights with friends and relatives. So I think that's something where - - you know, Gawker is not new to politics. Some other bigger hits have been in the political realm, the Rob Ford story out of Toronto, the Craig's List congressman.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: What about the fact that there are by my count roughly six billion websites devoted to politics.OGUINNAIKE: Yes. But the thing that Gawker has is name recognition. There is a brand identity, and you understand that when you go to Gawker you are going to get snark, but this time they will be laser-focused on politics. If you want more than just the facts man and you want your politics with a heavy dose of snark, go to Gawker.KURTZ: Gawker doesn't particularly like Hillary Clinton but Gawker said GOP candidates would be apocalyptic disastrous especially Donald Trump.ARGETSINGER: Trump has been very good business for Gawker. If you want an example, this is where snark lives these days, every time they write about Donald Trump they have a new thing that describes him. This week it's been human dust ball Donald Trump, Republican candidate and pee-stained snow cone.KURTZ: As somebody who made her living at this in the past...OGUINNAIKE: There are magazines that have made entire industries of making fun of Donald Trump. There would be no spy magazine for not for calling he names. There is big business of making fun of Trump. I am sure Gawker figured it out.KURTZ: Maybe Trump is the key.OGUINNAIKE: He's the gift that keeps on giving.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Hope he stays in the campaign. Finally, Amy, again, you used to make your living at this. The facts that -- do you think that gossip is just sort of transmuting into new forms or do you think it's peaked?ARGETSINGER: You know I think it's continuing to evolve on the web. People are still figuring out what will get the clicks. Certainly, though, political news is where a lot of the stuff lives. We got saturated with celebrity gossip. We needed to move on.KURTZ: Social media, everybody can now be a professional gossiper, Amy Argetsinger and Lola Oguinnaike, thanks very much for joining us.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: And next we try something new, your questions from Facebook.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Time for your Facebook questions. Kat we actually are more informed or simply more opinionated? No question all the opinion mongers on cable news have helped fuel the polarization of the news. But we're also in a wired world. More news and information is at your fingertips. Here is a question from Marcy. If the media stopped covering Trump's every cough and sneeze it would force him to spend his own money on advertising which would end this media circus. How hard would that be? Things are better. We only cover every cough, not every sneeze. You seem to indicate we're -- Trump is a master, much of the coverage is negative, although we said earlier I think that helps him. He makes himself endlessly available for interviews but some of his rivals might take a page from his playbook.That's it for this edition of MediaBuzz.

9	9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/11/23/lawmaker-pushes-bill-to-allow-states-to-deny-syrian-refugees/	Lawmaker pushes bill to allow states to deny Syrian refugees	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" November 23, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Welcome back, everybody.What was it, I think 34 governors, right, who didn't want those Syrian refugees the way things stand now. They thought it would be dangerous. We don't know where they're coming from. We don't know if they are going to be threat to security. And the law is the law, that regardless of their protests, they have no control over this. And the feds rule, and they have to drool.Republican Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida wants to change that.How so, sir?REP. TED YOHO, R-FLA.: Hey, Neil. Happy Thanksgiving to you.CAVUTO: To you as well.YOHO: What we want to do is, we want to go ahead and make sure the governors have the authority to not accept Syrian refugees.According to the 1980 immigration -- or Refugee Act of 1980, the federal government can come in and place these. But they have three things they must do. They must tell the governors where they're coming from and how many. They must tell them where they're going within their state. They also must guarantee that they're free of threat.And right now, we just came from a hearing not too long -- a day or two ago, and director of the FBI and the director of DHS...CAVUTO: Right.YOHO: ... said that they could not guarantee that they could guarantee where those people came from, so they can't vet them.So, we're giving protection to the governors, so that if -- when they refuse them -- and there's 31 -- or 34 governors, as you stated -- they don't have to accept them. And this gives cover to the governors.CAVUTO: Has it ever been forced down a governor's throat in this latest go-around? Because I think the governor in Indiana, he didn't want one Syrian family in. The governor of Connecticut took pity, a Democrat, and took them in. So, that's how it's been dealt with on individual cases sometimes, not all the time.But tell me, what -- who rules in this case?YOHO: I think you are going to see the state win, because if you listen to Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution, the federal government must guarantee each state free from invasion. And they can't do this trying to resettle these people.CAVUTO: I see.YOHO: And this is not anti-Muslim, this is not anti-Syrian refugee. This is anti-terrorism and deals strictly with security of the United States of America.And that is the number one goal of our federal government, is to provide for our common defense.CAVUTO: You know what changed a lot of stuff, Congressman, and you're a better judge than I, is when 47 Democratic colleagues of yours agreed, not on this particular issue, but on the fact that we should sharpen our vetting of this and how we go about approving those who want to get into this country.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: That puts the president in a pickle, does it not, if he wants to veto this?YOHO: Oh, man, it sure does.And we have got veto-proof in the House with the SAFE Act that Chairman McCaul's bill that we passed.CAVUTO: But you're assuming the Senate even takes this up. Right? Harry Reid has said he won't. What do you think of that?YOHO: Well, it's irresponsible of Harry Reid to say that.Again, this is -- we -- this is not a time to play politics. This is a time to do what's right for America. This is what is time to do what's right for national security.When you have ISIS doing what they have done and the spread of what they have done, and your report just so eloquently pointed out that they found the same bomb-making materials in Brussels that was used in Paris.CAVUTO: That's right.YOHO: And that ISIS has said that American blood tastes sweeter. They're coming to the White House.We need to take this threat seriously. And we need to make sure that the people that come here are who they say they are, because if you go back to the one of the terrorists back in Paris, one of those has a fake Syrian I.D. and passport. And the ones in Honduras, those are false Syrian passports. And then we have got a family down on our Southwest border.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: No, there's enough -- there's enough little dots to check off there.YOHO: There sure are.CAVUTO: Congressman, thank you very, very much. I appreciate it.YOHO: Neil, have a great day. And happy Thanksgiving.CAVUTO: To you as well, sir. Thank you.YOHO: Yes, sir.CAVUTO: All right.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
