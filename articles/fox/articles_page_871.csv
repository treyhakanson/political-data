This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, we are live in Cleveland as the Republican National Convention gets under way and America faces new fear about a growing racial tension that has boiled over into the deadly targeting of men in blue.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. High above the Quicken Loans Arena for day one of the RNC here in Cleveland, Ohio. The focus of this day is security. The theme, Make America Safe Again.  Throughout the hour, we'll be bringing you key moments of the speeches as this convention comes at a particularly troubling time in America's history. It all starts almost two week ago with the police-involved shooting death of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.The very next day, another black man, Philando Castile, was shot to death by police during a traffic stop in Minnesota. The aftermath of that shooting broadcast live online. Outraged protesters would take to the streets across America to call for police reform. President Obama would respond and say the situation is one all Americans should care about. But hours later as protesters marched through the streets of Dallas, the very men and women who were protecting the protesters became targets of a madman. Five officers were killed.Nine others injured in the deadliest attack on law enforcement since 9/11.  President Obama attended a memorial for the slain officers, insisting America is not as divided as we seem, but any hope of unity was short lived when another madman ambushed police yesterday in the place it all began, Baton Rouge. Three officers were assassinated on the job. Several more were injured. This convention here opened with remarks about Baton Rouge, and it will play large on the main stage tonight, including speeches this hour by Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, which we'll bring to you, and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.But Trace Gallagher starts us off with the murders that have quickly become the hottest political issue in the country and that Donald Trump will be addressing later this week. Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And, Megyn, police know exactly how the latest shooting transpired because they have the pictures. Much of the ambush was captured on surveillance cameras. Authorities say the killer, a former sergeant in the marines, traveled from his home in Kansas City to Baton Rouge just to carry out these attacks. They believe he spent days surveilling police headquarters, planning his assault. Then early Sunday morning, lured police to a shopping center where he used a rifle to open fire, unloading 25 to 30 shots, killing officers Matthew Gerald, Montrell Jackson, and Deputy Brad Garafola.People say the killer was affiliated with an anti-government group and posted social media messages complaining about police treatment of African- Americans. President Obama condemned the killings and then called on politicians to cool the, quote, ""inflammatory rhetoric."" If that request was aimed at Donald Trump, it did not work. Trump, who calls himself the law and order candidate, accused the president of lacking leadership and said that something is going on. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I watched the President. That sometimes the words are okay, but you just look at the body language. There's something going on. Look, there's something going on.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Several police unions believe President Obama is making things worse by validating what they call the false narrative of the anti-cop sentiment. The New York Times recently wrote that when it comes to race and policing, the President is conflicted, quoting, Mr. Obama has sought to use the authority of his office to amplify and support the emerging Black Lives Matter movement while struggling not to become an unwitting megaphone for anti-police sentiment. Police unions are now pushing for Hillary Clinton to denounce the Black Lives Matter movement. Today Clinton called for condemning cop killers and also changing police departments. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: That means investing in our police, in training on the proper use of force, especially lethal force. How to avoid using force to resolve incidents.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Clinton says now the country needs her experience. Trump says the country does not need her bad judgment -- Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you.Well, my next guest says he doubts we'll make it through this convention in Cleveland without violence in the streets. He also says he understands why the gunman who killed the police officers in Dallas is being described as, quote, ""a hero"" by some folks.Malik Shabazz is president of Black Lawyers for Justice and former president of the New Black Panthers Group. Thank you, Malik, for being here.MALIK SHABAZZ, NATIONAL PRESIDENT, BLACK LAWYERS FOR JUSTICE: You're welcome.KELLY: What do you mean by that? You can understand how some people are hailing this cop killer as a hero?SHABAZZ: I don't know if I said that, but what I can --KELLY: You did. You said it to our FOX News reporter Mike Tobin yesterday because the people in the audience behind you were chanting hero, hero about him.SHABAZZ: Excuse me. I did not say that --KELLY: And you said, I can understand --SHABAZZ: Excuse me. I did not say that but I can tell you that the --KELLY: You did. We can run the tape.SHABAZZ: Let's talk about the pain and the suffering of black people who are killed by police officers on a regular basis without due process, serving as judge, jury and executioner on a regular basis. Our blood is being spilled in the streets. The blood of Alton Sterling, the blood of Philando Castile, let's take it back to Mike Brown --  KELLY: Michael Brown was the aggressor on the police officer.SHABAZZ: No, he was not. That was your version.KELLY: No, it wasn't. It was Eric Holder's Department of Justice --SHABAZZ: Department of Justice has failed us as well. Our blood is --KELLY: What facts do you have that Michael --SHABAZZ: Our blood is --KELLY: So, we're going to have it back and forth --SHABAZZ: Okay. Our blood is in the streets.KELLY: What facts do you have that Michael Brown was not the aggressor, that Officer Darren Wilson was the aggressor?SHABAZZ: Because I've lived in St. Louis, and I talked to some of the witnesses, and I know that in America, unless you have a videotape, then the word of the officers prevails.KELLY: Do you understand that at least five Black witnesses came forward in that case to say that Michael Brown was the aggressor?SHABAZZ: Michael Brown was an unarmed, and Michael Brown --KELLY: He was unarmed until he tried to steal the cop's gun.SHABAZZ: And your attitude is part of the problem. Your attitude --KELLY: I have no attitude other than to uphold the truth.SHABAZZ: No. No. That basic position of what we call white supremacy, white privilege, is believing that an unarmed black man, all of us unarmed, being killed by armed police officers somehow it's our fault. But we don't see white males in America --KELLY: For the record, I'm not a white supremacist.SHABAZZ: No. It's a position. The position that you believe that your lives are better than ours.KELLY: Well, I believe that you are the one who has made the racially insensitive statements.SHABAZZ: No, no. It's a racially insensitive country.KELLY: Time and time again. That's why it's hard to take you seriously when you try to speak out about police and issues of race.SHABAZZ: Take me -- take me very seriously. As these police departments are choking out black men such as Darius Robinson in Oklahoma, choking the life out of us. We can't even make it to trial and get a decent trial with due process without the police of America killing us outright. And that's why everybody is upset.KELLY: Why can't we agree that there are some cop shootings that are bad and there of course are some cops that are racist?SHABAZZ: Okay. Got that.KELLY: Right. Of course. But by the same token, some of these shootings are okay.SHABAZZ: Which one? Which shooting is okay?KELLY: To the extent -- listen, and what I mean by okay is within the confines of policy and the law. In other words, the defendant was attacking the cop as we saw in the Michael Brown case.SHABAZZ: No, no. I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that.KELLY: So there's no -- there's no reasoning with you.SHABAZZ: No, no.KELLY: Can't you understand that the cops feel like targets now just for doing their job?SHABAZZ: I'm not going to blame Mike Brown for that. The Police Departments in America have -- no one has constrained them. No one has brought them under control. This type of attitude --KELLY: President Obama's DOJ has 26 investigations into them. He is --SHABAZZ: No, he has not. The Department of Justice has failed us. The prosecutors in America such as St. Louis County have failed us. And this campaign here is creating an atmosphere where more police brutality is expected in America.KELLY: More police brutality?SHABAZZ: More police brutality is expected due to this type of campaign, which promotes racism and division. It's going to create more police who desire to kill us.KELLY: Do you believe that white people are inherently evil?SHABAZZ: I believe that the actions that they show through using excessive force, through violating the constitution, through killing us, show that our lives -- show that our lives --KELLY: Do you use the term cracker to refer to white people?SHABAZZ: No, no, excuse me. You want to disrupt you, want to deviate from the --KELLY: No. I want the audience to know what you stand for.SHABAZZ: I want to tell you what I stand for.KELLY: Do you use the term cracker to refer to white people?SHABAZZ: Do you want to let me talk?(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Go ahead and answer.SHABAZZ: Okay. But your first question was, do I believe you are inherently evil. I believe that your policies and your actions are evil, and they result in us being killed when in the same circumstance --KELLY: I got that. I got that. What about cracker? Do you refer to white people as cracker?SHABAZZ: Do I refer to white people as cracker?KELLY: Yes.SHABAZZ: I have in my anger, as many people in their anger have referred to others as derogatory names.KELLY: I don't think that's a common term.SHABAZZ: Okay.KELLY: Did you say that we should kill every g-damn Zionist in Israel?SHABAZZ: No, I never say it.KELLY: Never said that. Their g-damn little babies. That old ladies should be blown up?SHABAZZ: We're going to leave the strip and acknowledge the death of Sandra Bland --KELLY: Okay.SHABAZZ: Freddie Gray, Mike Brown.KELLY: Freddie Gray, four acquittals in that case. Four acquittals of those officers.SHABAZZ: Bad prosecution.KELLY: Bad prosecution.SHABAZZ: Darius Stewart --KELLY: African-American judge.SHABAZZ: Darius Robinson.KELLY: African-American prosecutor.SHABAZZ: Eric Garner, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile.KELLY: I'm granting that there's some bad police shootings.SHABAZZ: No, worse than bad police shootings. It's a bad system, and the country is going totally in the wrong direction. And until we get justice, there's not going to be no peace.KELLY: I got it.SHABAZZ: And until the court system works, there can't be no peace. And until we get reparation and compensation for all the blood --KELLY: Reparation?SHABAZZ: -- that you're spilling of our blood, then, Miss Kelly, there cannot be peace. There cannot be peace. It's the white power structure and you're part of that. You're an important voice.KELLY: Okay.SHABAZZ: If you would stop being so hostile to our position.KELLY: I'm not hostile to anything.SHABAZZ: You do recognize that Black Lives Matter.KELLY: We have a lot of folks, Black Lives Matter in this program. But they don't always take antagonistic positions when it comes to white people as a group. I have to go because I have my next guest --SHABAZZ: Do you believe -- do you believe that Black Lives Matter?KELLY: I got to go because I have my next --SHABAZZ: There it is.KELLY: Thank you for being here.Well, our next guest represents the men and women keeping folks safe in this very city as the convention plays out. And he says not only does President Obama seem to have his finger on the scale on this debate over cops in America. He says the commander-in-chief has the blood of these fallen officers on his hands.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DET. STEVE LOOMIS, PRESIDENT, CLEVELAND POLICE PATROLMEN'S ASSOCIATION: We have a president of the United States and a governor of Minnesota making the statements that they made less than one day after those police-involved shootings, and those police-involved shootings, make no mistake, are what absolutely has triggered this rash of senseless murders of law enforcement officers across this country. It is reprehensible, and the president of the United States has blood on his hands and it will not be able to become washed off.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Detective Steve Loomis is president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association and with me now. Detective, thank you for being here.  LOOMIS: Thank you for having me.KELLY: So he's got blood on his hands for the death of the --LOOMIS: Absolutely, absolutely. But you know, Megyn --KELLY: How do you pin that on Black Lives Matter or on President Obama?LOOMIS: We're used to activists. We're used to an anarchists. We're used to militant people that want to blame everybody for their problems other than themselves. And we're used to that kind of rhetoric. What happens when the president of the United States, when athletes, when actors, when they use their fame to approve of the false narrative that's out there from Black Lives Matter and from the new Black Panthers --KELLY: The President defends cops in every remark -- in every speech he makes and then he says but we also must acknowledge. I mean Malik Shabazz obviously is a race hater who has spent a life condemning Jews, condemning whites, and what have you. But that doesn't mean that all these cop shootings are good shootings, if you will, good in the terms of policy and within policy.LOOMIS: Sure. And if they're not, the officers are prosecuted and they're convicted. We are a land of laws.  KELLY: In the vast majority of cases, the cops are acquitted.LOOMIS: Absolutely.KELLY: And many people believe that system is rigged in their favor, that you can't get a conviction of a cop.LOOMIS: You know, what are we going to do with people that believe that?  You know, you're telling me that the black judges, the black prosecutors are all corrupt and they're all just trying to get the cops out of trouble.  It's a ridiculous notion, and it's one that will have to change if we're going to move forward.KELLY: What about the fact that blacks are killed in disproportionate numbers compared to their population size to whites in this country?LOOMIS: Well, we're called into the African-American neighborhoods.  Blacks are victimized by other black people as well in disproportionate numbers from other people and other races across this country. We're called into these neighborhoods, Megyn. In -- I'm sorry -- Baton Rouge, Louisiana, those officers were called. There was a black man that called and said, hey, that black guy over there is pointing a gun at me. Those officers responded to that. They didn't go there. President Obama had that guy --KELLY: When people see Alton Sterling standing out in front of this store taken down and shot on video and we're not law enforcement, but you know the reaction that people have to this, which is it doesn't look like he deserved to lose his life. I didn't see a gun. If the gun was in his pocket, why? Are the police trigger happy when it comes to African- Americans as people like Malik --LOOMIS: Listen, that's a ridiculous notion. I've been a police officer for 24 years. I've answered thousands of radio calls, people that need help and not one time did I get on the radio and say, hey, what color is the family?KELLY: But that's you. Right? I mean, they're positing there's an inherent bias against blacks by cops even if the cops themselves are blacks.LOOMIS: It's an excuse for the failures that certain leaders in the African-American community have. How are we ignoring the fact that over 500 homicides in the city of Chicago. In the city of Cleveland, we had 132 homicides last year, and if you take the black suspects that killed black people out of that equation -- and I'm talking about a two-year-old baby, I'm talking about a six-year-old baby, a 72-year-old grandmother sitting on the front porch. If you take them out of that equation, the city of Cleveland would have had 29 homicides last year. I'm not calling anybody names. I'm saying there's a problem here. We need to look at it.We need to address it as a thoughtful community, and not spread the venom.  And when the president of the United States and athletes and everybody else buy into this false narrative of Black Lives Matter, the new Black Panther Movement, Al Sharpton, when was the last time that guy got anything right?KELLY: He's dangerous.LOOMIS: He's absolutely dangerous, and now police officers are getting killed because of that rhetoric.KELLY: Detective, thank you for being here.LOOMIS: Thank you so much for having me.KELLY: Appreciate it. So there you have that. That was an interesting exchange. We've got a star-studded prime time lineup for you at the RNC.  It's just getting under way. We're waiting to hear from Sheriff David Clarke on this very issue you just heard us debating.Also former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Donald and Melania Trump and many more when they speak, we'll bring it to you live. Race relations will also be a topic at next week's Democratic National Convention. And on the list of speakers, the mother of Michael Brown, from Missouri, 18-year-old whose death touched off the Black Lives Matter Movement even though the Officer Darren Wilson, was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing. What kind of a message did that send to the voters? We'll have a fair and balanced debate, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, the Republican National Convention in Cleveland is under way, and the theme for the RNC today is Make America Safe Again.  We are waiting to hear from two men with years of firsthand experience in national security and law enforcement. Former presidential candidate and New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, Sheriff David Clarke.When they start speaking, we're going to listen. And we're getting new reaction now to Democrats' plans to address the growing national anxiety of a law enforcement and race relations in America. At the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia next week, Leslie McFadden will be a featured speaker. In the summer of 2014, her son, Michael Brown, was killed by Ferguson, Missouri, Police Officer Darren Wilson. That incident set off violence in Ferguson and fueled the Black Lives Matter Movement.In the end, Officer Wilson was cleared of any crime. So the question now, given that the DOJ concluded Mike Brown robbed a store and then attempted to kill a police officer, why are the Democrats reaching out to his mother?Tucker Carlson is editor-in-chief of The Daily Caller and co-host of ""Fox & Friends,"" and Austan Goolsbee, is a former adviser to President Obama.  They're with me now. You know, she's got the mother of Trayvon Martin going. That's, I mean, non-controversial invitation, right? There have been plenty of bad police shootings where you could invite the mother of the victim, but Michael Brown is a different case, Austin. Smart move?AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER ADVISER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't know. There are two questions. One is the group of mothers, all of whose children were killed by police, they're being invited as a group.KELLY: But he was killed by a police officer because he attacked the police officer. That's what the DOJ find.GOOLSBEE: You may be right. I'm not familiar with these DOJ findings.KELLY: Trust me.GOOLSBEE: I know he was unarmed.KELLY: Trust me. He was unarmed until he tried to grab Officer Wilson's gun and shoot him, right?GOOLSBEE: That may be true.KELLY: Trust me, it's true.GOOLSBEE: This group of mothers, this is not a thing that was decided this week. This is a group of mothers that endorsed Hillary Clinton months ago, and they have been traveling as a group, campaigning.KELLY: So you can't single the one out?GOOLSBEE: I think it would be a little weird to say we're going to have all of these mothers that have been appearing as they've been going along, but this one is not --KELLY: Okay. Tucker, what about that?TUCKER CARLSON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER: I don't think it would be weird at all. I mean, they're using the Michael Brown case as a metaphor to explain interactions between the black community and the police. It's completely wrong. It's a form of racial demagoguery.  They're saying what happened to Michael Brown could happen to you if you're the wrong skin color. The truth is you just said that according to the Obama Justice Department, this guy tried to grab a cop's gun. And by the way he's a thug and --KELLY: And there were a bunch of independent witnesses, African-American witnesses, who completely backed up --CARLSON: It's not a matter of conjecture. We know what happened.  GOOLSBEE: Look, all I would ask you is, is it your view, then, that they should not have any of the mothers?KELLY: No.GOOLSBEE: That we shouldn't talk about that, or just that they should identify --KELLY: There's a reason I focused on Michael Brown with Malik Shabazz, because that death was what started it all with Black Lives Matter. And in part because of the derelict media that jumped to conclusions in the case and put on his friend, Michael Brown's friend, who told a lie about hands up, don't shoot and then he was murdered. And it was a lie, and the media did not shine the same spotlight on that revelation.GOOLSBEE: I think that's a fair critique of the media though in the Justice Department report, what also came out of that report was that there was deep, ingrained racism in the Ferguson Police Department.KELLY: Absolutely.GOOLSBEE: And a lot of really questionable and awful things.  KELLY: Completely right, and people have a right to object to that and to the extent they find that --GOOLSBEE: So I understand the critique. I still think Hillary Clinton is highlighting an issue about the interactions of race and police and that these are things that we should pay attention to.KELLY: What about that? Does this hurt her, Tucker, because obviously politically speaking, she has most of the black vote already siding with her.CARLSON: Yes.KELLY: And Blacks often vote Democrats. Right? Like a lot of times we --CARLSON: It's one thing to have someone side with you. It's another thing to have someone vote for you. Scaring people using false racial demagoguery -- she gave a speech to the NAACP in which she said all white people need to apologize for their privilege? Really.KELLY: Okay. I'm going to stand you by. Look at the extraordinary welcome for Sheriff David Clarke of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They are on their feet. Let's listen.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY, WISCONSIN: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make something very clear. Blue lives matter in America.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(CROWD CHANTING ""USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!"")I stand before you tonight with a heavy heart as the law enforcement community prepares to bury of three of Baton Rouge, Louisiana's finest.  But there is some good news out of Baltimore, Maryland, as Lieutenant Brian Rice was acquitted on all charges.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And the malicious prosecution of activist State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby.  Now, I want to talk to you about something important. Indeed, a concept that five law enforcement officers were murdered and nine more were wounded for earlier this month and for which three more were murdered two days ago in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. And that is the importance of Making America Safe Again.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)You see, I believe that this noble mission is not just a requirement but a pre-requisite for achieving this campaign's goal of Making America Great Again.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)We simply cannot be great if we do not feel safe in our homes, on our streets, and in our schools. I see this every day at street level where many Americans increasingly have an uneasiness about the ability of their families to live safely in these troubling times. This transcends race, religion, ethnicity, gender, age, and lifestyle.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And if you don't believe it, a recent Gallup poll confirms it. And more than half of all Americans now worry a great deal about crime and violence, up consistently and dramatically from just a few years ago. And for African-Americans, that number is 70 percent. Sadly, for a growing number of communities, the sense of safety that many of us once took for granted has been shattered. Americans don't always feel safe no matter if they're working in a big city, living in a suburb or rural areas all around this great country. I often tell residents of Milwaukee and the city and towns that I visit that safety is a shared endeavor.It starts with the willing acceptance of people to play by society's rules, a code. A code, if you will, where we collectively agree upon that ensures stability, fairness, and respect. It is built on a foundation of trust in each other and in the people who administer and enforce society's rules, which at its foundation is the rule of law.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)In 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote passionately about the interrelatedness of all communities and states and about our inescapable network of mutuality tying us in a single garment of destiny. He spoke of the basic morality of the rule of law provided it is applied equally to both the wealthy and the impoverished, both men and women, and, yes, the majority and the minority. What we witnessed in Ferguson and Baltimore and Baton Rouge was the collapse of the social order. So many of the actions of the occupying movement and Black Lives Matter transcends peaceful protests and violates the code of conduct we really on, I call it anarchy.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)You see, American law enforcement officers understand that race is and has been a heated issue in our country. Most appreciate the vital need for thoroughness and transparency and pursuit of the greater good in their actions and in their investigations. These are truths that are self- evident to me and which I practice, and they are the truths that Donald Trump understands and supports!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Donald Trump is the steadfast leader our nation needs. He has spoken passionately to me of his belief in our American system of justice, and he speaks to the values that are foundation of social contract.(AUDIO GAP)CLARKE: . his voice not only in defense of the character of the American police officer, but the need for all people to feel that they are being treated fairly and respectfully by law enforcement.(APPLAUSE)CLARKE: You see, Donald Trump understands that what can make our nation safe again is a recommitment to a system of justice in which no government official, not even those who have fought their way to the marble and granite halls of Washington, no private citizen, no elected official, even Hillary Clinton, and no group of people despite the fervor with which they press forward their grievances can claim privilege above the law. It cannot happen in the United States.(APPLAUSE)CLARKE: The tradition of the primacy of the rule of law in America is strong. It is in those simple facts, and in our acts, we will move forward toward making America safe again. God bless you, and may God continue to bless these United States of America.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Sheriff David Clarke, bringing the crowd to its feet, talking about the battles that law enforcement faces in this country today. I want to get a word back with our panel again now, Austan Goolsbee and Tucker Carlson. So, politically, we were saying, how does this play out? Because Donald Trump is telling everyone, that he's the law-and-order candidate.  Tucker, you were saying before the break.CARLSON: Well, let me just say, I don't think there's anybody the left dislikes more than Sheriff David Clarke, because what do you say to Sheriff David Clarke? He makes a really good point. Police are being murdered and it's not just an attack on the police but against our civilization, the rule of law.KELLY: The social contract, as he put it.(CROSSTALK)CARLSON: The left is taking sides, in effect, with people who threaten it.  And Clarke calls them out on that and so does Trump. Look, that is really the choice. Which side are you on? That's true.GOOLSBEE: I would say a couple of things. The first is I disagree with the Trump endorsement, but there were a lot of things that Sheriff Clarke said that were pretty powerful, that I think most Americans would agree with, about we got to play by the rules, we must respect the rule of law.  Now, I would argue that Donald Trump is not a rule of law candidate.  You've seen the rule of law, traditional rule of law Republicans.KELLY: Is Hillary?(CROSSTALK)GOOLSBEE: Reject Donald Trump quite significantly.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Only one of them was under threat of indictment by the FBI.(LAUGHTER)GOOLSBEE: Well, not true. Only one of them has had consent decrees signed with the Department of Justice, the SEC, and others. I think Donald Trump's own personal behavior as a businessman, but also the positions that he espouses are not traditional rule of law conservative positions. The rule of law wing of the conservative party is not happy that Donald Trump is the nominee, and most of them are not at this convention. And I think that's not by coincidence.KELLY: Great to see you. Thank you so much for being here. We're going to have much more of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland straight ahead, including the first appearance by Donald Trump, as he seeks to secure his party's nomination for president.Plus, two of the men almost killed trying to protect the consulate in Benghazi spoke a short while ago and brought down the house. We'll show you why in moments.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, we are moments away from Donald Trump's first appearance at the Republican National Convention. Mr. Trump will not be giving a big speech tonight. Instead, we're told he will be introducing his wife, Melania Trump. We expect Melania to speak for a few minutes before Trump joins her onstage again. When Donald walks on stage, we will listen and will also listen when Mayor Rudy Giuliani speaks moments from now.Throughout this hour, we have been discussing the focus of tonight's convention program which is Make America Safe Again. A short time ago, we heard from a couple of folk who's had loved ones killed by illegal immigrants. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My son's life was stolen at the hands of an illegal alien. It's time that we have an administration that cares more about Americans than about illegals. A vote for Hillary is putting all of our children's lives at risk.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have been talking about illegal immigration since 2012, since he got killed, and no one listened until Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hillary Clinton, or as we know her, Crooked Hillary, always talks about what she will do for illegal aliens and what she will do for refugees. Well, Donald Trump talks about what he will do for America.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: For more on this, I'm joined by Juan Hernandez, a Latino Trump supporter, Jose Antonio Vargas, who is founder of Define American, and Laura Wilkerson, whose son, Josh, was killed by an illegal alien. Thank you all for being here. Let me start with you, Laura, because you're in this arena where I think most of the folks here may see the issue as you do. You know, you want a harder stance on illegal immigration. And you're sitting next to Jose, who is himself an admitted undocumented immigrant. I mean, is it hard to look at him and say, I want you kicked out? You know, I want the Trump plan that would lead to you being removed?LAURA WILKERSON, SON KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT: I think if you're not a United States' citizen, you don't have a seat at the table regardless, especially where you're making laws. You just don't have a seat at the table. You know, we have to remember families like my own. And I first want to thank Maria Espinoza of the Remembrance Project, who created a national foundation. And Donald Trump said he would implement that for our families. There's nothing to help the families who are devastated like our families are.KELLY: So, what do you make of that? You hear the stories like Laura's where her son, Josh, was killed and you can understand the fire over it?JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS, DEFINE AMERICAN FOUNDER: Of course. I'm really sorry about that. You're right, by the way. I don't have a seat at the table.  We're at the mercy of Congress people, Congress members who haven't done anything. What's really interesting listening to all of this, we haven't even talked about the President Obama has deported more than 2 million immigrants in the past seven years. That's more than any other president in modern history. I have no say over what's going to happen to me. Right now, the Republican platform says get rid of all of us.(CROSSTALK)WILKERSON: It's not up to Congress to do something. It's up to you to get in line and become an American citizen. It's not up to them to solve any problems. There is a law. It needs to be enforced. Close the borders.  Enforce current laws and, you know, welcome to America if you come in the front door.VARGAS: Actually, ma'am, there is no line for me to get in the back of.  That's why we need for something to happen. I'll be here 23 years next month. There's no process.WILKERSON: Then you've had plenty of time.VARGAS: If there was a process, I would have done it.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: He was brought here by his parents.VARGAS: When I was 12.KELLY: Right.(CROSSTALK)VARGAS: And I didn't come from Mexico. You know, actually.WILKERSON: Oh, Mexico has no bearing on it. I mean, it's legal or illegal. It has no bearing on color, race, or where you're from.VARGAS: Well, thank you for saying that. But, just so you know, the fastest growing undocumented population is the Asian people. So when Trump talks about the border and building that wall, I don't know.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But, Jose, I understand your problem that you're identifying with.  But what about Laura's problem and the -- I mean, sympathy is nice.VARGAS: Yeah.KELLY: But they want it to stop. And they see the best way of stopping, you know, the future murders by illegal immigrants is to keep them out of the country and throw them out of the country.VARGAS: Well, we don't want murderers here. I don't understand how people can go back in and out, in and out. I haven't left this country since I was 12. I have been here. So I agree with this idea of making sure people don't come in and out, in and out, in and out. But this is where we need to figure out what are we going to do with all the people here? The majority of folks have said, even the Republicans have said that the majority of them believe there should be a path to legalization for somebody like me.KELLY: What do you think about that, Laura? Do you favor any sort of path to legalization?WILKERSON: Just coming in the right way. Get in line, and come in and tell us who you are. We have a right to know who's in this country. So that's the only thing I believe. You know, they've put themselves in harm by coming here.KELLY: What about people like Jose who didn't?WILKERSON: Well, his parents should be accountable for that. It's my opinion that your parents should be held accountable for that. You've had long enough to get in line. I mean.KELLY: Let me ask Juan because he's a Donald Trump supporter. You see the issue, right?JUAN HERNANDEZ, TRUMP SUPPORTER: I do.KELLY: They're not going to agree, and the American people haven't done a very good job of agreeing either. Is this an issue? You're a Donald Trump supporter. Do you support him on this issue?HERNANDEZ: I do support him on this issue. I work in the criminal justice field. And so, I see repeat offenders. It's happening and if you're here undocumented and you're here illegally, if you're here illegally and you're here undocumented, if you get in the criminal justice system, then you go back. And then if you come in, then you go back. I mean, I see it repeatedly. They arrest them and just let them go like another legal citizen.KELLY: What about people like Jose who haven't been breaking additional laws, who haven't.VARGAS: I haven't done anything illegal.KELLY: He hasn't done anything illegal.HERNANDEZ: To me, we have to use resources in the right way, right? So if we have people, you're not just one person. If there was just one person, that would be fine, but it's multiple people. You have someone who is undocumented, and you have someone who is undocumented, and you have someone who is undocumented.KELLY: I got to go, but I have to ask you quickly. You still support Donald Trump as a Latino despite the comments he made about the Hispanic judge?HERNANDEZ: I do, because I wouldn't want someone on there who is going to -- who I feel has bias on me. If they go to court, they're.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Based simply on their heritage, you could deduce they were against you?HERNANDEZ: If I were -- yes, I agree with him.KELLY: You are entitled to your opinion. That's why I asked you. Great to see you all. Thank you so much for being with us. Thank you for being here.We've got breaking tonight, new reaction to one of the convention's most dramatic moments so far, a move from delegates against some of the GOP rules that could ensure Donald Trump as a Republican nominee. There was a bit of a revolt from the floor today. It all came hours ago, and we've got the details behind the chaos and some controversial comments that happened and whether Donald Trump's nomination is in danger? Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Right now, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton is addressing the convention. Senator Cotton is the youngest person serving in the U.S. Senate. He's an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran who joined the army after the 9/11 attacks. Let's take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TOM COTTON, R-ARK.: We're blessed to serve, and we're grateful for the generosity of our fellow citizens. But there are a few things we'd like. We'd like a commander-in-chief who speaks of winning wars and not merely ending wars.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Rudy Giuliani should take the stage with a much anticipated speech.  Earlier today, the anti-Trump vote forced some drama onto the floor of the convention hall. Some call it an effort to free the delegates. Others say it's a movement with no chance of succeeding except for potentially embarrassing Donald Trump. Here's how it played out. It was extraordinary.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those opposed shall say no.(CROWD SHOUTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Chief Washington correspondent James Rosen is live on the convention floor with more. James.JAMES ROSEN, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, for decades, reporters and others have been complaining that modern presidential conventions are too scripted and dull, coronations full of drama and conflict, not here, not tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CROWD SHOUTING POINT OF ORDER)(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: Forces loyal to Ted Cruz claiming to represent the GOP grassroots as well as dedicated never-Trumpers went ballistic when they were denied a roll call vote on whether to adopt the rules package governing this convention. And the existing rules were adopted with a voice that sounded fairly evenly divided. Delegations supporting Ted Cruz cried out shame, and delegates from Colorado and Iowa stormed out. At issue were proposed changes to rules that would have benefitted Ted Cruz, both this week and in 2020. The never-Trumpers of course wanted to unbind delegates from the presumptive nominee. Heading up Team Cruz were Ken Cuccinelli, former Virginia attorney general and Utah Senator Mike Lee. Cuccinelli at one point angrily hurled his credentials to the floor. When not negotiating with those men behind closed door, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus and Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort for feverishly whipping delegates to peel them away from the anti-Trump forces and they succeeded.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What just happened on the floor is outrageous.  Clearly, this is what they've been doing all along, trying to stop us from the delegates voting their conscience.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There were several motions made by people associated with Senator Lee. Every one of them lost. If you actually look at what the facts were, Bret, you had 44 states and all the territories overwhelmingly supporting Mr. Trump, overwhelmingly supporting the ticket, these rules.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: In the short term, the Cruz forces got very little of what they wanted. The Texas senator will have his name placed in nomination. He will address the delegates. We're told that a threatened walkout, mass exodus of delegates who were supportive of Ted Cruz will not happen. That will not be used to embarrass Donald Trump as one Cruz delegate told me, I've been married to my wife for 34 years. We have fights. When the fight is over, we go back to ourselves, and it's just like that for delegates, Megyn.KELLY: Did you say back to our cells?ROSEN: Yes, we go back to each other is what I meant. It's loud. There's distractions.KELLY: Right, right. All right, James, great to see you.ROSEN: Likewise.KELLY: So the Republican's strong hold of Utah was one of the states today that tried to jump start overturning the GOP rules package backed by Trump supporters. Headlines are already calling the fight a nightmare moment for the Republican establishment. Senator Mike Lee, who was the driving force for the convention floor fight joins me today. Of course, the mainstream is he is going to say any chaos here at the RNC convention is a nightmare.  What were you trying to accomplish in layman's terms?(OFF-MIKE)MIKE LEE, U.S. SENATOR: . miles from home in order to participate in a process. We just wanted a vote on our own rules.KELLY: You wanted to let the delegates vote for whomever they wanted to vote for.LEE: It's what they do, it's what we do at conventions. The first order of business at any convention is to adopt the rules.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: That would disenfranchise them because they were promised to Donald Trump.LEE: This has nothing to do with Donald Trump. This has everything to do with the rules of our party, which we have the right to decide. The rules of our party are decided by the convention as a whole, not by a couple of RNC officials operating in a back room somewhere. So more than anything, Megyn, this was just a lost opportunity. We had an opportunity to come together as a party, to really have unity. Unity exists in a party where you can iron out.(AUDIO GAP)LEE: . like today, vote, and then move on. We didn't have that opportunity today, and so we missed an opportunity. It's kind of sad.KELLY: You have not been a Donald Trump supporter or fan. You had a contentious exchange with one of the hosts about whether it's because of your personal friendship with Ted Cruz.LEE: No.KELLY: Is that it?LEE: Absolutely not. It has nothing to do with that. In fact, I don't blame this situation on Donald Trump. I feel bad for Donald Trump in this circumstance. This hurts Donald Trump. I think Reince Priebus owes Donald Trump a huge apology.(CROSSTALK)LEE: Because this hurts Donald Trump. If he had let the delegates be heard, Donald Trump would still have gotten the nomination. I am 99.9 percent certain he will. He would have anyway, and he would have been stronger as a result. He missed an opportunity tonight that was denied to him by the RNC because the RNC wouldn't let the delegate dozen what they're here to do, which is vote on the rules.KELLY: You're not a never-Trumper, but you're not a Donald Trump fan.LEE: Correct.KELLY: What does Senator Mike Lee do in November?LEE: Look, I'm waiting to be won over. I want to be won over. I want.(CROSSTALK)LEE: No, no. For me, it's about constitutional protection, federalism, separation of powers, restoring the proper form of government. Federalism and separation of powers, put government back closer to the people where it's supposed to be. I want to hear him talking about those things. If he talked about those things, about federalism, separation of powers, he'd win all over all kinds of people like me, all across the country.KELLY: Great to see you, Senator.LEE: Good to see you.KELLY: Thank you. Joining us now with more, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor and Dana Perino, co-host of ""The Five"" and former White House press secretary. Hi.DANA PERINO, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: Hi.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Hi.KELLY: So, was it a kerfuffle of significance? Stirewalt, let's start with you.STIREWALT: I would say the kerfuffle was fairly significant as kerfuffling goes. But I will say this, to the senator's point, this is about feeling all the feelings. Conventions are like after a family fight. You get together, you break bread. People get together and say I said things, you said things. This really was an opportunity today to start to exercise some of these demons that have plagued the party through the cycle.KELLY: Senator Ted Cruz was unhappy with me a couple weeks ago because I gave him a hard time on the air about speaking at the convention after he said really horrible things about Donald Trump, that he said he believed -- remember the last day of his primary, he said in Indiana, I'm going to tell you what I really think about Donald Trump, and then it was a string of just really awful stuff. Is this -- is this the chance to get past that kind of thing, Dana? Should he be speaking here to try to get past that and get the party past it?PERINO: I would actually say it goes both ways. Loyalty is not just a one-way street. And I would say that the nominee for the party actually has some responsibility, and I don't disagree with the senator that like in a football game when the ref explains the call, I feel like they deserved an explanation.KELLY: It was supposed to happen, and it didn't happen.PERINO: And I also think to extent the family metaphor, if they don't allow people to have a voice, it's not going to get better. In the Wall Street Journal poll over the weekend, 60 percent of Republicans said they're unsatisfied with their nominee. It doesn't mean Trump is not going to get the nomination but he does have a responsibility to try to win people over. Why not give it a shot?KELLY: Doesn't this event do that, Stirewalt? People start to feel like, yeah, GOP grand.STIREWALT: Well, as long as Trump -- for the first part of the convention is about the party, the last day is about the nominee. So this is a chance to get together. Remember, they love this. These people are almost as big politics nerds as I am. So it's their convention. It's not just their convention to pick a nominee. They get together. The party unifies. They like who they are. They like what's reflected. They feel good about it.  And then at the end, it's sort of the bride and groom. The two parts become ready for each other and then you have the union at the end.KELLY: Then what happens?(CROSSTALK)KELLY: I knew he was going to go there.PERINO: Then they would go to a honeymoon.KELLY: Now, it feels good. Now, it feels weird because we're talking about politicians and not really man and wife. Great to see you both.There's still much more ahead from the Republican National Convention, including a speech from former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Melania Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: . and they demand a lawful system of immigration that protects their safety and their financial well-being.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So live here in Cleveland, we expect that in moments Donald Trump will actually take to the stage very briefly and introduce his wife, Melania Trump, who is expected to make some very personal remarks about her husband. And then the two of them will say some sort of a goodbye. That will be the moment to watch in the evening.Also Rudy Giuliani coming up moments from now, so don't miss any of that.  ""The Kelly File"" is going to be live at 9:00 p.m. in Cleveland all week. And don't change the channel because Bret Baier is sitting right there and the drama continues next.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Bret Baier, in for Chris Wallace.  As both campaigns face new fire storms, we're live in Las Vegas, counting down to the final debate with both campaigns' vice presidential nominees.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BAIER:  The Trump campaign plays defense over explosive new allegations about Donald Trump's treatment of women.  HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The disturbing stories just keep coming.  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It's a rigged election because they're taking these unsubstantiated, no witnesses, putting them on the front pages of newspapers.  BAIER:  We'll discuss whether Trump can recover, live with his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence.  And newly uncovered Clinton e-mails reveal troubling insights about her campaign.  TRUMP:  She should be locked up.  She should.  BAIER:  We'll ask Clinton's running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, about the revelations.  Then, our Sunday panel on how Trump's troubles could impact the GOP.  And a roundtable of political reporters from crucial battlegrounds on the state of the race.Plus, a very special power player as our own Chris Wallace prepares for the final showdown between Trump and Clinton.  CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  It's not a TV show that we're doing.  This is helping millions of people decide who we're going to elect as the next president.  BAIER:  All right now on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)BAIER:  And hello again from Fox News in Las Vegas.  We are live on the Strip here at the MGM Grand Hotel just down the road from UNLV, the site of Wednesday's final debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, moderated by our very own Chris Wallace, who is busy preparing today.  As the candidates also prepare, both campaigns are in damage control as Donald Trump continues to face allegations of groping women and new WikiLeaks e-mails show troubling insights about Hillary Clinton's top associates.  Today, we'll discuss it all with both vice presidential nominees.  We'll get to Senator Tim Kaine in just a moment.  But we begin with Donald Trump's running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence.  Governor, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""  GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-IND., VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Good to be with you, Bret.  BAIER:  Governor, there's a new poll out this morning, a Washington Post/ABC poll, and it shows the race essentially tied, within the margin of error. It's four points.  But if you look at it, it's exactly the same as it was before the convention.  I want to get your state of the race and considering that some states, Republican states like Utah, Arizona, Georgia, even your own state of Indiana, according to some polls, are very tight.  What is happening out there?  PENCE:  I think what's happening is this is a highly contested election, and it's going to be fought all the way to the finish.  I couldn't be more proud to be standing shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump as he articulates an agenda to make America great again.  And I have to tell you the crowds that I saw across Florida, the crowds that gathered with Donald Trump yesterday in New Hampshire and Maine are all just determined to bring real change to this country, Bret.  I mean, look, the last 7 1/2 years have weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, and begun to walk away from our most cherished constitutional principles.  As Donald Trump did last Sunday night in the debate, we're going to continue to frame this campaign around the issues that matter most to the American people, and I think that's why the polls are close and I think that's why we've got a great, great opportunity -- a great, great opportunity for a great victory come November the 8th.  BAIER:  Governor, Donald Trump has not let up.  He's campaigning all the time.  He does it in his own Trump way.  But yesterday, he said something that did raise some eyebrows.  Take a listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We should take a drug test prior because I don't know what's going on with her.  But at the beginning of her last debate, she was all pumped up at the beginning, and at the end, it was like, oh, take me down.  She could barely reach her car.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Governor, do you think Secretary Clinton should take a drug test before Wednesday?  PENCE:  Well, look, all I know for sure is that Donald Trump is going to be ready for the debate on Wednesday night.  The American people are going to see someone who is prepared to lead this country, prepared to bring the kind of strength and determination that it's going to require to really turn this country around.  Look, more than seven out of ten Americans know our country is headed in the wrong direction.  Donald Trump has articulated a message of strength, a message of rebuilding our military, reviving our economy, not through the tax increases that Hillary Clinton is advocating, expanding Obamacare, and open borders policies that she actually advocated in a speech in Brazil, but through the kind of policies that have always revived America's strength at home and abroad.  So, I'm looking forward to the debate, and I know he'll be ready for it come Wednesday.  BAIER:  All right.  Drug test or not, I want to ask you some specific policy questions in just a minute.  But I know you've answered these questions about the accusations.  There's a new one out today.  Now, nine women with these allegations.  And I know you've said that they're politically motivated and they're all not true.  But I want to ask you two things about the way Donald Trump has talked about them and pushed back, pushed back hard, denying them, saying on numerous occasions, how could this be true, look at her.  Have you talked to your daughter about that defense and this whole issue?  How do you explain that?  PENCE:  Well, let me just say that I thought it was right and proper last weekend for Donald Trump to apologize for the offensive comments that he made in a video that was released 11 years ago on an open microphone.  He said he was embarrassed.  He apologized to his family, apologized to the American people.But, frankly, you know, the timing of these unsubstantiated claims that have come forward, all of which Donald Trump has categorically denied, is I think deeply troubling to millions of Americans.  I know there's countervailing evidence that's coming out right now, and more information will probably come.  But the American people are very, very troubled.  Once again, here we are in an election of such enormous magnitude in the life of this nation, and once again, the media is piling on with unsubstantiated claims as the headlines while they ignore an avalanche of hard evidence about corruption, pay to play, political favoritism emanating out of Hillary Clinton's years as secretary of state.  We found out this week, Brett, that while she was secretary of state, her officials in that department actually directed reconstruction contracts in Haiti to friends of the Clintons.  This is precisely the kind of pay to play politics she said wasn't happening as their foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments.  Just this morning, ""The New York Times"" is reporting that in exchange for a five-minute meeting, the government of Qatar pledged $1 million to the Clinton Foundation.  You know, this -- the American people are tired of all of this, and frankly, they're very tired, present company excepted, they're very tired of most in the national media who would go running after unsubstantiated allegations that Donald Trump has categorically denied while they willfully ignore an avalanche of hard evidence about Clinton's corruptions and scandals.  BAIER:  Well, about the WikiLeaks e-mails, you know, I know you look at the substance of those and we've been covering the substance inside those emails as well, extensively here on FOX, but are you concerned at all about the fact that Russia, according to U.S. intelligence officials, has hacked into these computers and is, according to the intel officials, trying to influence this election in one way or another?  PENCE:  Well, I think there's no question that the evidence continues to point in that direction, and we should follow it where it leads.  And there should be severe consequences to Russia or any sovereign nation that is compromising the privacy or the security of the United States of America.  Donald Trump more than a month ago gathered a group of some of the leading cybersecurity experts in this country and announced our plans to strengthen the security of this country on the Internet.  And we will do that.  BAIER:  Is the cyber attack --(CROSSTALK)PENCE:  My hope is that as the vice president said on another network this morning, that there would be consequences.  My hope is that this administration will follow through with that because the president of France just this weekend said that the Obama administration's foreign policy that Hillary Clinton created of moving red lines in Syria actually was interpreted as a weak position for America and emboldened Russia to invade Ukraine and take a much larger role in Syria.  We've got to follow through on our word, and we ought to follow the facts where they go.  We've got to protect the cybersecurity of this country.  My hope is this administration will follow through this time.  BAIER:  I want to squeeze in two more questions quickly.  Iranian-backed Houthi rebels firing on U.S. Navy ships.  The U.S. just described (ph) firing cruise missiles back at these satellite installations.  What should --what would you recommend as vice president, if it's President Trump, the U.S. military do?  Should the navy expand these strikes, or is there some fear of Iran being drawn into a war there?  PENCE:  The United States Navy and the United States of America cannot tolerate aggressive action against our warships, but it's important to remember that the militia in Yemen that's firing those missiles has been supported by Iran.  This administration, with Hillary Clinton's full assent, just delivered $150 billion that the Iranians said they were putting in their defense budget.  It could well be some of that $150 billion, including $1.7 billion in cash, made its way to Yemen and is subsidizing these very attack against U.S. naval warships.  Look, we've got to rebuild our military.  We have the smallest United States Navy since 1916.  We have the smallest standing army since the end of World War II.  When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States of America, we're going to rebuild our military, and we're going to stand tall on the world stage and we are not going to tolerate aggression against American forces or American interests, whether it comes from Yemen or is subsidized from any other country like Iran.  BAIER:  Governor Pence, I just have a few seconds left.  What advice would you give your nominee for Wednesday's debate?  PENCE:  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear that, Bret.  BAIER:  Well, advice would you give your nominee for Wednesday's debate?  Quickly.  PENCE:  Well, I would just tell him be himself again.  I thought in the first two debates, Donald Trump brought that authentic voice that has really given voice to the aspirations and frustrations of millions of Americans on a national stage.  And he clearly won the debate last Sunday night because he was talking about the issues that matter most to the American people -- restoring our military, standing tall in the world again, reviving this economy, creating jobs, upholding the Constitution and the Supreme Court of the United States.  I mean, I understand why many in the national media, present company excepted, want to talk about everything else except the issues.  But Donald Trump won that debate last Sunday, and he's going to win the debate on Wednesday because he's going to keep talking about the issues that matter most to the American people and the chance that we can make a change of the fundamental direction of the this country back to a stronger and more prosperous nation.  BAIER:  Governor Pence, we appreciate your time.  Thank you for coming on.  PENCE:  Thank you, Bret.  BAIER:  As Hillary Clinton takes time off the trail to prepare for the debate, there are plenty of unanswered questions about the newly released WikiLeaks e-mails surrounding her campaign.  We spoke earlier this morning with vice presidential Democratic nominee, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BAIER:  Senator, thanks for being here.  I want to put up the latest poll from Washington Post/ABC.  It is essentially exactly where this poll was before the convention, 47 to 43.  Judging from all the things that you and Secretary Clinton are saying on the trail about how unacceptable Donald Trump is, why do you think this poll is so close, within the margin of error, actually?  SEN. TIM KAINE, D-VA., VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Bret, yes, it is close.  I'll tell you, I'm used to this.  I'm from Virginia.  All of our races are close.  I've been saying from the beginning that I thought this would be a close election.  So, it doesn't particularly surprise me.  We are seeing some data about voting, whether it's registrations, early voting, and request for absentee ballots in key battleground states that we like.  But I'm down in South Florida campaigning yesterday and today because Florida is close and there's so many other close states.  We have to assume that's the case, and I think it'll be the case right up to the end.  BAIER:  Senator, a lot of information is coming out, as you know, in these WikiLeaks e-mails, including some pretty embarrassing things from communication in the Clinton staff and campaign.  Are you comfortable with what is -- has been said in some of those e-mails about Catholics, about Latinos, Governor Richardson a needy Latino, about former NAACP leader Ben Jealous, taking him to be powerless?  What's your reaction to the specifics we're learning and the substance of those e-mails?  KAINE:  Yes, Bret, let me do it, but before I get to specifics, I want to talk about a couple of them, you know, we just got to be a little bit careful about these because since they're part of an effort by both Russia and WikiLeaks, and neither of those are kind of neutral transmitters of information, you can't just automatically assume that everything is on the up and up with these e-mails.  Just as an example, there's one e-mail that references me that is completely inaccurate.  And whether it's inaccurate because the sender didn't know what he or she was talking about or it's been doctored, I don't know.  I don't take all these at face value.  But let's talk about the Catholic one.  Jen Palmieri, who is Catholic.  She's said, yes, I sent that e-mail and I had some opinions and I shared them.  But I do know what Hillary Clinton thinks about Catholicism because she picked a Catholic running mate.  And we talked a lot about my faith background and she and I feel like that's a connection for us.  She's Methodist but had a powerful experience as a young person that still drives her today in her own faith practice.  So I know with respect to Catholics, she views this as an asset because it creates a connection between us in terms of our approach to service.  So, yes, look, some of these e-mails that are leaked, if they're accurate, they show people offering, you know, opinions and mouthing off a little bit here and there.  But that's the kind of thing that happens.  BAIER:  But, Senator, there's more substantive things that raise questions about -- for example, the e-mail investigation.  Here is President Obama talking about what he knew and when to CBS News.  Take a listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CBS NEWS:  Mr. President, when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an e-mail system outside the U.S. government for official business while she was secretary of state?  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  At the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.  CBS NEWS:  Did you know about Hillary Clinton's use of private e-mail server --OBAMA:  No.  CBS NEWS:  -- while she was secretary of state?  OBAMA:  No.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  At the same time, Senator, he was using a pseudonym and an e-mail address to communicate with Secretary Clinton.  And there's communication and there are e-mails from staff that suggest they wanted to hold that back and were talking about what to do.  Did the president lie there?  KAINE:  Well, I don't know because -- I actually do not know if he's communicating by e-mail with Hillary, does he know that it's a private server?  I mean, I don't exactly know if I send somebody an e-mail exactly what their setup is.  I don't really think about that much, and I can't imagine that the president, with all that's on his mind would either.  I do know is this, that there was an extensive, as you know, Bret, investigation by the FBI under the direction of a wonderful and tough career public servant, Jim Comey.  Jim was in the U.S. attorney's office in the eastern district of Virginia when I was the mayor of Richmond.  And he's somebody with the highest standards of integrity.  And he reached a conclusion after a very long investigation that no reasonable prosecutor would take this to the next step.  I think that still has not been effectively challenged.  I know there are people who would like to re-litigate that, but given the depth of that investigation and his own credibility, I think his conclusion, you know, probably gets it right.  BAIER:  I understand that.  But, you know, the campaign is focused on the Russia angle.  And definitely, you talk to U.S. intelligence officials, they're very concerned about Russia interfering --KAINE:  We ought to be.  Yes.BAIER:  -- into cyberattacks.  That's clear.  But at the same time, you're saying that while John Podesta's Gmail was hacked by Russia, you're saying that Hillary Clinton's server was completely ironclad and was not hacked at all.  You mentioned Director Comey.  Here's what he said about the private server.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR:  I'm not looking to pick on Gmail.  Their security is actually pretty good.  The weakness is in the individual users.  But yes, Gmail has full-time security staff and thinks about patching and logging and protecting their systems in a way that was not the case here.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  So in other words, John Podesta's Gmail was less secure than Hillary Clinton's server.  KAINE:  Well, you know, and Jim Comey also reached a conclusion through the FBI investigation that they didn't have any evidence that these materials had been compromised.  And I don't -- I haven't seen any evidence come out since he rendered that conclusion that would cause --BAIER:  We're not talking about some other shoe to drop in the next 20 days.  KAINE:  I'm not.  I'm not.  I mean, look, it's very clear that both Russia and WikiLeaks want to, you know, drop a few documents at a time to try to create a story.  I think the marginal utility of each successive dump gets less and less.  And just, you know, out on the trail, so many people, they want to talk about jobs or how can America be safe in a dangerous and challenging world.  They are worried about this Russia angle though, Bret, as you mentioned.  You know, I -- at least in my lifetime, I can't think of a precedent of a foreign nation trying to destabilize an American election.  And I -- you know, I brought up a couple weeks ago the Watergate analogy of trying to destabilize an election by going in and grabbing files.  This is current version of that Watergate attack, I think.  BAIER:  Senator, Watergate was also about a cover-up.  There was a story broken by Steve Hayes with The Weekly Standard last night in which an interview with FBI investigators looking at Secretary Clinton's e-mail practices, an FBI records and classification official said he felt pressure from Patrick Kennedy, a senior State Department official, to change the classification of some Hillary Clinton e-mails.  To your knowledge, did anyone associated with Secretary Clinton or her campaign ask or instruct Kennedy to seek changes to classification of e-mails?  KAINE:  Absolutely not.  I have no knowledge that that happened, absolutely not.  BAIER:  And if you found out that they were trying to -- with a very specific way, hold back specific e-mails based on an arcane FOIA rule, doesn't that sound like somewhat of a cover-up?  KAINE: Well, you know, look -- here would be something you'd have to look at.  Classification of material changes all the time for all kinds of reasons and they're not all nefarious.  In fact, I'm on a couple of committees where I get classified information a lot, the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees.  I'm often asking, OK, is this material I can talk about or is it material that I can't talk about?  And I'll be instructed it's classified, and then three or four weeks later, it suddenly won't be classified, and officials in the Pentagon or State Department will be talking about it appropriately.  So, you do see classification of information change for very legitimate reasons.  So that would be something that you'd have to -- you'd definitely have to look at.  BAIER:  Two more things, quickly, Senator.  One is, were you upset when your hometown paper in Richmond did not endorse your ticket?  In fact, endorsed Gary Johnson, saying -- going as far as to say that Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton were acceptable to endorse.  KAINE:  Bret, actually, it's interesting.  I was kind of pleasantly surprised when my hometown paper made that endorsement because my hometown paper -- and it's a great paper.  I love the guys.  But they've never endorsed me in any contested race I've ever been in ever in 22 years in elected office.  Not for my first city council race, not for lieutenant governor, not for governor, not for senator.  But what they do is they endorse Republicans.  This is the first time that they have chosen not to endorse the Republican ticket for president in my memory, certainly in all the years I've lived in Richmond.  So, the fact they could not see clear to endorse the Republican ticket in Richmond, that was the news.  BAIER:  Last thing.  What would you -- what's the advice to your nominee for Wednesday?  KAINE:  You know, I think the key, Bret, on Wednesday, sort of in the first two.  I think she was very, very knowledgeable.  She demonstrated that.  There was a significant gap in that way between her and Donald, and I think he feels like he lost the debate.  And that's why he's kind of going wild a little bit.  But the other thing about it, it's the demeanor.  I think that's what people look at.  They're looking at that debate as a crucible, as a high-pressure situation, and they want to see somebody whose demeanor suggests to them that person has the temperament to be president and commander in chief.  She did a great job on that in the first two debates.  I certainly expect she'll do that again.  BAIER:  Senator Kaine, thanks for the time.  KAINE:  You bet, Bret.  Glad to talk.  (END VIDEOTAPE)BAIER:  Up next, how will Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton respond to the latest allegations in this week's debate?  We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss strategy and what's at stake Wednesday night as we continue our broadcast live from the MGM Grand Hotel right on the strip here in Las Vegas, Nevada.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Right now, she's in debate prep.  I don't know.  This is Saturday.  That's going to be Wednesday.  If you got to study all that -- you're supposed to know this stuff.  CLINTON:  It's a little challenging debating someone like that.  He seems remarkably unacquainted with the truth.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Both candidates revving up their bases as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton get ready for the third and final presidential debate here in Las Vegas.  It's time now for our Sunday group.  Charles Hurt, political columnist with The Washington Times, Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin, who's covering the Clinton campaign, Monica Crowley, editor and columnist for The Washington Times, and Democratic strategist Joe Trippi.  Jen, I want to start with you.  First of all, we put up a poll earlier that's pretty tight, four points.  But the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll just came out just moments ago and it is at 11 points nationally.  Two different polls, two different results. The average of polls has been around 5 percent.  What are you seeing on the trail there and the concerns in the Clinton campaign of what they're hearing?  JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, they're not really concerned because they're looking at battlegrounds state polls.  And what they're seeing in Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina in terms of early voting, what's interesting is that they have a record number of early ballots, particularly from Hispanics in Florida.  One in three early ballots have been requested by Hispanics.  And so, they're looking at those battleground states.  They say in Ohio, the campaign manager, had all the analytics.  He said there are 1 million early ballots that have already been cast, mostly in the Cuyahoga and Franklin Counties, which are favorable to Democrats.  BAIER:  For all their confidence, Charlie, there's still this sense that, you know, if Donald Trump has a bad week, he's still kind of hanging around.  CHARLES HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES:  Yes, I mean, 5 points or 11 points.  After what Donald Trump has been through in the past two weeks, it is the worst media maelstrom in the history of television for a political candidate.  The fact that he's still anywhere remotely within striking distance of Hillary Clinton, I think, suggests that he's still in it.  He still has a chance.  The question is, does he buckle down, focus on the issues, and stick with that stuff instead of going off on tangents?BAIER:  You know, Joe, you saw Mike Pence.  He's been answering these questions about the allegations.  I didn't go down the road too far, but, I mean, you have to think he's wincing on some of these answers or some of this campaigning about the accusers.  JOE TRIPPI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, he has to be because part of the whole problem, the difference in the polling numbers, is women.  And they've moved away from Trump, even groups that tend to be Republican with women.  Moderate Republican women are moving away.  And so, this isn't how you get them back.  They're gettable because they've been voting Republican all these years.  So, and they've got arguments.  But the argument isn't to go after the accusers.  So, I think this is a -- that's what I think is going to be interesting about this debate.  Is that the Donald Trump that shows up that goes after the accusers and keeps giving Clinton this advantage or does he try to reach out to them?  That's what I think is going to be the key.  BAIER:  Monica?  MONICA CROWLEY, THE WASHINGTON TIMES:  Well, I think it's astonishing that throughout this campaign, this man who has never done this before, who still has a skeletal campaign and relatively little money compared to the $2 billion that Mrs. Clinton will be breaking to bear throughout this campaign, is still in this race and particularly after the last two weeks where he's gotten hit time and time again.  The fact he's still standing tells me that this is still possible for him, despite what we're seeing in the polling, battleground states and nationally.  And that's because he's got -- he's got the majority of voters with him on the core issues: economic growth, job creation, enforcing the border, dealing with illegal immigration, dealing with the existential threat of Islamic terror.  So, he's got the voters with him on the issues.  If he can dispense with the latest scandal about the groping allegations quickly and forcefully in this debate and pivot to prosecuting the case against Mrs. Clinton and her record and then promoting his own positive agenda, he will reset this campaign.  BAIER:  I think the -- the question is over the bar of commander in chief and whether he got there throughout this process as of yet. You know, every -- every debate there's that question.Jen, you know, Trump supporters say, look at these crowds. These crowds are huge, in Donald Trump parlance. What about the Hillary Clinton crowds?GRIFFIN: Well, we saw a little bit of a change this week. You're right, the crowds have been relatively small. Fifteen hundred perhaps at each of the events. But we saw in Ohio, when she opened up the space, there were 18,000-plus people who came out on Ohio State University.The real concern of the Clinton campaign is that the campaign gets so ugly and that the rhetoric gets so -- so negative that people decide to sit out. So that is why you see Michelle Obama and President Obama out on the trail saying, this matters, make sure you come up -- you show up and vote.BAIER: Yes, I mean clearly Trump's crowds, though, Charlie, have been a lot bigger overall, 20,000, 30,000. The question is, is enthusiasm.HURT: Yes.BAIER: Is it -- is it on his side, even after all this kind of bad stuff?HURT: No, I -- I think he's lost a lot of it and I think that's -- I think that's where the -- that -- the past couple of weeks with the media hitting him on -- on all of this stuff has -- has really hurt him is just with the enthusiasm.But like, I think, Monica said, I think, you know, he can get it back if he just -- if he delivers a great debate performance, talks about the issues and -- and -- and, you know, gets over trying to hit back on everybody.BAIER: Quickly, Joe, when you look at the polls and -- and, again, this is from the Trump campaign perspective, that they say, it could shift. You know, it could shift or it's underreported. How many points is -- could it potentially be underreported?TRIPPI: I -- I don't think much. I -- I don't think we're seeing that. I -- I mean I think this is one of the things -- a lot of difference in these polls is just how do you project what's going to turn out, who's going to turn out. And so I think that the Trump campaign has decided to energize its base and to make sure they vote. I'm not sure there's enough of them, and that's why he's got to try to reach out to women and some of these people that have been pushed away. But that's what this debate's going to be about, I think.BAIER: Addition.Panel, we'll see you. We'll take a break right here. We'll see you a bit later.Up next, a look at the battleground map with political reporters from some key states that hold the path to the White House.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: A gorgeous early morning here. Welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday,"" live from Las Vegas.Joining me now to discuss the race in crucial battleground states, Chrissie Thompson, Columbus bureau chief for The Cincinnati Enquirer, Patricia Mazzei, political writer for The Miami Herald, and Tim Boyum, political anchor for Time Warner Cable News in North Carolina.Thank you all for being here.Let's go around the horn first about the presidential race, where things stand, what the campaigns look like, and what it looks like.Patricia, first to you.PATRICIA MAZZEI, MIAMI HERALD: In Florida, the average of the polls show Clinton up by about 3 percent. She's got many more organizational offices around the state. I think she's up to 72. Trump was really slow in opening them here. And the campaign still expects this to be a pretty tight race. This is still the quintessential swing state. The Clinton camp has said that they're expecting it maybe to be a 1 percent to 2 percent race. Obama, if you'll recall, defeated Romney here by one percentage point, which was about 74,000 votes, in 2012.BAIER: Chrissie, in Ohio, boy, the campaign, the Hillary Clinton campaign, looked like it was kind of backing off Ohio and then turned around and started campaigning there hard.CHRISSIE THOMPSON, CINCINNATI ENQUIRER: That's right. We've seen as -- with the start of early voting this past week, Clinton, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, John Legend, Madeline Albright is coming next week, any surrogate they can think of sending to Ohio to try to turn out their key African-American base and women voters. But among Republicans, there's a lot of enthusiasm for -- by Trump supporters, but there's kind of some infighting still going on between the Ohio Republican Party and the Trump campaign, which just yesterday disassociated themselves with the chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. So, a lot of turmoil going on there.BAIER: Chrissie, let ask -- just ask you quickly, how much difference does it make that the governor is not fully behind this -- this campaign and the machinery of the governor's office is not activated?THOMPSON: Well, it's meant that the top organizers and that the top political operatives in the state have not gotten behind the Trump campaign. Now, they've still hired some pretty good people, but their organization, as we've seen in other states, has kind of lagged the Hillary Clinton organization in strength and in numbers. And the chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, while he was a Kasich person, has been as helpful as maybe you can expect. However, he has been really honest to say that he's not sure if he's going to vote for Donald Trump, especially given some of the allegations of this past week and the tape from last Friday.BAIER: Yes.Tim, let's talk about North Carolina. It looks like one of the swingiest of swing states. And you have both the presidential race that's very tight, but also a U.S. Senate race that really wasn't expected to be very tight, but is very tight.TIM BOYUM, TIME WARNER CABLE NEWS NORTH CAROLINA: Yes. Richard Burr, the incumbent, most people thought was going to win this pretty handily. Deborah Ross, the Democrat, she's a former state lawmaker and legal director for the ACLU in North Carolina. The Republicans were banking on that she was too liberal for North Carolina. But he -- he -- Richard Burr has really fell victim to a very close presidential race and it is way tighter than anybody expected. In some polls, Ross is up by one or two. In others, Richard Burr is ahead. It's all within the margin of error.BAIER: And, Tim, is the campaign on both sides very active? Is one more active on the ground?BOYUM: Are you talking about the presidential race?BAIER: Yes.BOYUM: Yes, they're both very active. I mean last Monday we saw Mike Pence twice in North Carolina. President Obama was here on Tuesday. Both Mike Pence and Tim Kaine were here on Wednesday. Donald Trump made two appearances on Friday. Then we have Mike Pence scheduled for Tuesday this week already and Tim Kaine will be in the state on Wednesday and Thursday as early voting gets started in North Carolina, which is a huge deal because more than half of North Carolinians are expected to vote before Election Day.BAIER: So that keeps you guys busy.Patricia, finally, the Senate race in Florida, Marco Rubio, the incumbent, who decided to get back in, status of that race?MAZZEI: We have seen Rubio leading his opponent, who is a Democratic congressman, Patrick Murphy, consistently for nearly two dozen polls now. The averages have him up by about five percentage points, which shows that there is expected to be some ticket splitting with folks voting for Clinton for president and Rubio for Senate. He has maintained his support for Mr. Trump in the past week after falling under some criticism for remaining silent without saying if he was going to stick behind him or not. But it has been kind of tepid, and his campaign has said he's not going to campaign with him from here until Election Day.BAIER: OK. Patricia, Chrissie, and Tim, thank you very much, in those battleground states. We appreciate it.Next up, we'll bring back our panel here in Las Vegas to discuss how Wednesday's debate right here in Vegas will reshape potentially the race heading into November.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY: This was not just a lewd conversation. This wasn't just locker room banter. This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predator behavior.TRUMP: These are lies being pushed by the media and the Clinton campaign to try and keep their grip on our country. They are all false. They're totally invented.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: First Lady Michelle Obama in a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton denouncing Donald Trump's crude past comments about women and allegations being brought forward, another one this morning, as the Republican nominee pushes back, claiming the system is stacked against him.We're back now with the panel.What potentially, Joe, breaks through here as we get ready for this debate moderated by our own Chris Wallace, that changes dramatically the trajectory of this race?TRIPPI: I think the only thing is Donald Trump. Does -- I mean if I were him, ask for forgiveness. Say you're sorry and then say to the country, we've got 23 days to talk about the real issues and here are the differences.BAIER: Joe, you've just seen him campaign day after day. Do you really think that --TRIPPI: Yes, it's not his -- that's why I don't have a problem giving him this advice on -- on air. But that's what I would do. I don't think he'll do it. This is going to be about, does he continue to try to drive his base, and it's just not big enough with what he's driven away. And he's got to get people to take another look at him.BAIER: Monica.CROWLEY: Donald Trump's whole rationale for getting into this race was, I don't need this job. I'm rich. I have a successful business and a great family. I am doing this for the American people and the future of the country. That's what he needs to focus on in this final debate. He's got to prosecute the case against Mrs. Clinton, point to the wreckage of the Obama/Clinton economy and foreign policy and say, we tried it your way. And then, in the -- in the wake of all these WikiLeaks disclosures, put her on the defensive and say the media was colluding and still is colluding with your campaign to protect your candidacy. You were being tipped off as to the FBI investigation. There was collusion in terms of obstruction justice on the Benghazi e-mails. You knew that Qatar and Saudi Arabia were funding ISIS and yet your -- the Clinton Foundation was still taking tens of millions of dollars from these countries. If he's able to reset the campaign by laying out his positive agenda and then putting her on the defense, he has a fighting chance.BAIER: Jen, you know, we've been covering the WikiLeaks substance here on Fox in -- in pretty significant detail. There's a ton of it coming every day. What would have to drop in there that would be big enough to change the dynamic of this race? I mean, obviously, there are big things that have been out already, but big enough that it breaks through.GRIFFIN: Well, I think that's the trouble in covering the WikiLeaks e-mails because there are about a thousand coming out each day, is that they aren't breaking through. It's a drip, drip, drip. And I think what you will see Hillary Clinton do tomorrow night is she's going to change the subject. She is going to be talking about the Russian involvement in the hacking. That's why you saw Mike Morel come out on Friday, the former acting CIA director, and say that it is chilling that the Russians would be involved in our election. That is going to be her pivot point throughout the debate tomorrow night.But what's important is, I don't think that Donald Trump will be contrite. He's going to be on offense. And our own Fox News poll shows that if he gets 90 percent of the Republican voters, that's still only 30 -- of registered Republican (ph) voters, that's still only 32 percent of the vote. That's not enough. He has to appeal to independents and to women, and he's not doing that right now. That's not the tone.BAIER: Charlie, if, let's say, another shoe drops and we start seeing Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails from the 33,000 or -- I mean, what is the thing that this is so explosive that it's -- it changes it?HURT: If it's a WikiLeaks thing, it's going to have to be something huge because while Fox has covered it very fairly and aggressively, it's -- you know, the rest of the media simply has not covered it. And -- and it would have to be something so big that it shames the media into covering it forcefully.But what -- I think it's sort of interesting about all of this is that, you know, Donald Trump has run this -- this cowboy campaign, talking about a rigged system and how, you know, there's corruption behind the scenes. All the while, these WikiLeaks, you know, have sort of demonstrated that actually he has a pretty good point about all of it and it's proving his point. And if he is able, in -- in the debate, to do -- and I -- and I think he's done a very, very good job in the first two debates. I know I'm in the minority on believing that, but even in the first one. But if he can come back to that and just focus on the issues and focus on, you know, proving his point that it's rigged and that its -- you know, everybody's corrupt and all that kind of stuff, and stay away from the personal attacks, you know, this -- they -- I -- he's in -- he's got good -- good footing.BAIER: There's a lot of ifs there. And, obviously, there's some people who say that the rigged talk is -- is dangerous in the long term. But, you know, it's -- it's worked to fire up his base.Quickly, Joe, I talked with the local reporters about the Senate and the balance of power. House, not in play, do you think?TRIPPI: No, I don't think so.BAIER: But the Senate is precarious for Republicans.TRIPPI: I -- I think the House is getting more precarious, but not likely to go. The -- the Senate, I think, goes to whoever wins the presidency. If -- if these polls are right and Hillary Clinton is winning in these -- in -- in the majority of these swing states where there's Senate races, I think that the -- the Democrats are going to win those seats and probably enough of them that we take the -- the Democrats take the majority.BAIER: Joe, Monica, Jen, Charlie, thank you. Gorgeous view here in Vegas, isn't it.CROWLEY: Gorgeous.BAIER: Place your bets. Thank you.Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" It was a really tough booking. How our own Chris Wallace is preparing for the make-or-break final presidential debate this Wednesday.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Another look here live at the Las Vegas Strip ahead of the third and final presidential debate. Hard to believe it. It all started a little more than 14 months ago in Cleveland when I, along with my colleagues Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace, moderated that first fiery prime time Republican debate. Remember that?The voters will get one more chance to see these candidates face off this Wednesday night when ""Fox News Sunday's"" Chris Wallace asks the questions as only he can in the final presidential debate.I got a really tough booking, an exclusive interview, a look at how he's preparing. Here's our very special ""Power Player of the Week.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"": Good morning and welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.BAIER (voice-over): Since 2003, you've seen him on ""Fox News Sunday,"" grilling politicians.WALLACE:  And FBI Director James Comey said none of those things that you told the American public were true.BAIER: You've seen him pinning presidential candidates down in primary debates.WALLACE:  Question, sir, with that record, why should we trust you to run the nation's business?BAIER: But Wednesday, October 19th, award-winning journalist and host of ""Fox News Sunday,"" Chris Wallace, takes on a new role, moderator of the final general election presidential debate, the first Fox News anchor to get the nod. Held in Las Vegas less than three weeks from this historic election, the stakes are extremely high.BAIER (on camera): So, you ready?WALLACE:  Pretty close. I've got a couple of more days and I'll be tweaking and who knows what's going to happen in the world, but I'm pretty close.One of the things that we've done, and I don't think any of the other networks did, is they basically said, you got a good team at ""Fox News Sunday."" You guys prepare for the debate. So I've got my crack researcher, Lori Martin. I've got my executive producer, Jes Loker. It's just the three of us against the world here.Coming under heavy fire --BAIER (voice-over): Before his 13 years hosting ""Fox News Sunday,"" Wallace worked as an anchor and correspondent for ABC News. And before that, NBC News, as chief White House correspondent and then moderator of ""Meet the Press.""BAIER (on camera): How many elections have you covered?WALLACE:  Well, the second Lincoln one -- no. In terms of really covering, 1980 would be my first, Ronald Reagan.BAIER: You have a long history with these two candidates. I saw some video of you interviewing Donald Trump on the convention floor in 1988.WALLACE:  It's true. I was one of the floor reporters for NBC.And one of the interesting things about any national convention is the surprising people who show up on the floor. And here tonight is real estate tycoon and best-selling author Donald Trump.TRUMP: Well, thank you very much.WALLACE:  Well, you're -- you're welcome.TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE).WALLACE:  You have flirted with the idea of politics. Now you're here at your first national convention. Does that get you interested in possibly making the plunge?TRUMP: Now you have to tell me something, who told you I flirted?WALLACE:  Well --TRUMP: I didn't know that I flirted.WALLACE:  Well, I wasn't talking about this year, Mr. Trump, but you have said that if you ran for president, you'd win.TRUMP: I think I'd have a very good chance. I mean I like to win.BAIER: And Mrs. Clinton.WALLACE:  The first time I ever met her, actually, was also in '88, but it wasn't on camera. This was when Bill Clinton gave the nominating speech for Michael Dukakis. And after going on and on and on, final he said --BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: In closing --WALLACE: Well, the next day, Clinton went around to each of the various networks to do a kind of apology tour, you know, to say, well, maybe I talked too much, but -- kind of to save his budding political career. She came along with him. I did the interview with him.BAIER: You've interviewed both candidates on ""Fox News Sunday."" You've given them both tough questions before.WALLACE:  Are you a little thin-skinned?TRUMP: No, I'm only thin-skinned when somebody says bad things that are false.WALLACE:  He not only directly contradicted what you said, he also said in that hearing that you were extremely careless and negligent.CLINTON: Well, Chris, I looked at the whole transcript of everything that was said, and what I believe is, number one, I made a mistake.WALLACE:  An interview, it's you and the candidate and you're the person holding them to account. This is a debate. And, you know, they're both going to be on the stage. If I think there's a need for me to intervene, I will, but I would prefer not to.And basically you're there as a time keeper, but you're not a participant. You're there just to make sure that they engage in the most interesting and fairest way possible.And I take it very seriously. It's not a TV show that we're doing. This is part of civics, the Constitution, if you will, in action because this is helping millions of people decide who we're going to elect as the next president.BAIER: But at this moment, you know, what this moment means for you.WALLACE:  It means a lot. It means a lot personally. It's kind of a statement of where you are in this business. It also means a lot to me because, quite frankly, it means something for Fox. I'm the first Fox moderator to do a general election debate, and I'm very proud for the news organization. I think it's a recognition of the fact that we do serious journalism. Some critics say no, but the fact is you and I know we do and here's the commission on presidential debates recognizing that.Look, there's a lot of pressure. There's a lot of stress.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" May 28, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hillary Clinton can be for the trade agreement. The president is. She can be against the trade agreement. I am, Elizabeth Warren, many of us are. But I just don't know how you don't have an opinion on this enormously important issue.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Independent socialist Senator Bernie Sanders now running for the Democratic nomination calling out Hillary Clinton. And he is not alone. You have Richard Trumka, with the AFL-CIO, the president of that labor group, saying that unions could hold back an endorsement possibly of Clinton or offer a weak nod essentially and not get liberals fired up for this nomination if she decides to come out for the trade deal that President Obama is pushing.So we are back with the panel. A.B., what about this? And, you know, we heard from Hillary Clinton on all sides but not a definitive yes or no.A.B. STODDARD, THE HILL: Well, my favorite response of hers is when she says that she needs to see what's in it, because, as a former member of the Obama administration married to a former president, a former secretary of state who was a student of this deal, and someone that the Obama administration is desperately hoping will support this deal, she has access to what's in it. I can tell you she doesn't have to go to the secret room in the capital that's behind several locked doors like members do to find out what's in it. So she is pretending she cannot obtain this information and make a decision.What's interesting about what's going on is unlike these other issues, where she wants to hide -- the Keystone pipeline which labor supports and the administration opposes, she has never said anything about the Keystone pipeline. On the deal with Iran, which she is dodging an answer on, she is now under pressure in this what was to be the cakewalk primary from big labor. And they're saying, I mean, it would be one thing for Bernie Sanders to say it, she will ignore him. But for Trumka to come out and say we need an answer now, this is actually a problem for her. I bet she actually probably ends up flipping on it if she feels the heat. I don't see her coming out saying I'm going to help my friend President Obama pass this deal.BAIER: Everything we are hearing about this in Democratic circles is that she probably is going to come out, Steve, against this deal.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, she would be better off doing it now so she has time to actually explain herself than waiting and building this pressure. I think A.B. is right. I think she will come out opposed to it.But the real problem for her is not that just she was a member of the Obama administration, not that she knows what's in the deal. This was a centerpiece of the pivot to Asia. She was secretary of state. This is what she was doing for all those years that she was flying around the world. And she is going to have to flip-flop on something that is the core of her legacy as secretary of state. It's raw, naked politics, and it's bad, and I think she is going to do it anyway.BAIER: Charles, she is in South Carolina yesterday. And she says ""I went to work for President Obama because he and I share many of the same positions about what should be done in the next presidency."" This is maybe not one of them.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, that's kind of a weird statement, particularly because she is wayward on something that is so important to the president. I mean, this is going to be the one area where he is going to leave a legacy in foreign affairs that I think will stand up, the TPP, because it will help to strengthen our relations. We were speaking about China. It will be essential to strengthening our relation with our allies in the region. If we reject it, it will be a disaster. They will all have to gravitate into China's orbit.But, I mean, it's rather amusing. Steve is right. This is her legacy. But it tells you the TPP and China that she has no legacy as secretary of state. I mean, if that's it, where essentially it was the beginning of a trade treaty where she said it was the gold standard, but it means so little to her that she now says I have no idea what's in it, I don't know how I'm going to end up, it tells you what the four years were spent doing, and it amounts to essentially zero in terms of accomplishments.BAIER: And quickly A.B., the latest Quinnipiac poll for honest and trustworthy, would you say Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy or not? Yes 39 percent, no 53 percent, still upside down.STODDARD: Yes. Again, I don't think this is going to be a problem for her in the primary. I think she wins the Democratic nomination and I think if she loses the general election it will all come back to this. But she's going to make it there. She's going to make it to the final two.BAIER: That is it for the panel. But stay tuned to see how the media is covering spring allergies.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.
