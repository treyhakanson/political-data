"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" August 15, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   ANDY BARKETT, RNC CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER: We want to win. We want to win elections. That's our goal. We want to win '14; we want to win '16. We want to win every election after that. Right now what we're investing in is we're investing in building stuff. The stuff that we're building is the data science, the analytics to figure out which voters we need to be going after.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   JOHN ROBERTS, ANCHOR: That's Andy Barkett, he's the Republican National Committee's new chief technology officer, and he is charged with beating the Democrats at their own game in 2016, and that is data-mining in order to find out where those voters are who are persuadable to your side. So let's look at politics and the RNC right now with Tucker Carlson, we're back with Julie Pace, and Charles Krauthammer. The Democrats had a great game on the digital side of things in 2012. Can the Republicans, Charles, match them?  CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I don't see why not. I mean, it's true that the smart, young technologists are probably predominantly liberal, but there are enough of them. How many do you need, 50, 100, in the whole country that could actually the RNC at least match what the DNC did? So I don't see why in principle that's going to be difficult. I think the real story is, what's the message? What's the best way to approach young people and minorities? And it isn't only African American minorities, Hispanic. And interesting enough, of all the minorities you would have expected would have been split evenly would have been Asian-Americans, who have done extremely well economically, and yet they were overwhelmingly on the Democratic side. That actually is a puzzle that I think the RNC ought to think about and think about a message that would be more appealing. What are they missing in this?   ROBERTS: So the Republican National Committee, Republicans across the country getting together for three days up in Boston, Julie, to talk about the way forward, how they win in 2014, how they win in 2016. Give us a little bit of a playbook here. What do they need to do other then get more people to vote for them?  JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, 2014 doesn't look like a bad year for Republicans at this point. I think if you talk to most political analysts, the House looks pretty safe for Republicans. Some of the Senate races are looking good for Republicans. The Democrats are having a hard time recruiting in some states. 2016 is where the puzzle is still a little unsolvable. It's just not a matter of building stuff, as Andy said. It's a matter of crafting a message that will appeal to new people. It's not just that they didn't reach the voters that they needed and get them out to the polls and find where their addresses were and their polling places were. They just didn't have the electorate that actually couldn't trump the electorate that the Democrats had.ROBERTS: And you've got to have compelling candidates as well when you are looking at the 2016 race, Tucker. And part of this RNC summer meeting is to put forward the new stars of the Republican Party -- the Marco Rubios, the Chris Christies. But when you look at those two people, they are being undercut by certain factions of the party at the same time that the RNC is trying to put them out there to say this is our future.TUCKER CARLSON, EDITOR, THEDAILYCALLER.COM: The final question is who is going to unite the party. The divisions are really deep and significant. And you think at the end, you know, some Reagan-like figure will come and convince the libertarians to get along with the establishment Republicans, with whatever the neocons are, whatever. It's almost hard to see anybody in the field now who is going to be capable of doing that. The divisions are really bitter. There is just a tiny union set of beliefs between, say, Rand Paul and Chris Christie. The sniping between them I think is at a higher level than the normal sniping between potential candidates. It's heart-felt.ROBERTS: And you've got one or two, if you've got a broad Republican field, the sniping at each other with Hillary Clinton already the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party, having such a wide field, does it help the candidates or does it hurt them? But the other aspect of the Hillary Clinton story is that you know, she moving into the building of the Clinton Foundation taking up a couple of floors. What are your thoughts on all of that?KRAUTHAMMER: It's an association I'm not sure is going to help her politically. It's a perfect reflection of the persona of her husband. If you had to describe him and his presidency, you would say successful, charming, as always, rouge-ish, and sloppy, disorganized. I'm talking about the way he ran his White House, the pizza at 3:00 a.m., the stuff where it was like a bull session in college that went on and on. And that is reflected in the foundation, which has got as the New York Times showed in a very long article. These connections with corporate, celebrity, with money, with people who are self-dealing, is pretty messy. And I'm not sure if you are a candidate, despite Hillary's celebrity and how much she is adored by Democrats, it's a difficult association and it could be harmful.ROBERTS: Julie, just quickly, we've only got a few seconds left here. Politics -- philanthropy too close to politics here?PACE: Well, I don't think that anybody is going to be voting for or against Hillary Clinton based on what the Clinton Foundation is doing, but I think that that article and other articles you've seen really underscore the question that she has to answer, which is does she want to go through the scrutiny that she would have to run for president.ROBERTS: Sign of the scrutiny she'll face? Tucker?CARLSON: Do you think Hillary Clinton is going to be a great candidate? Go back and look at tape of her speeches from '08. Yeah, it will remind you. Brutal.ROBERTS: Thanks, folks. That's it for the panel, but stay tuned as some clever tactics get caught on camera. We'll be right back.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Anthony Williams, Eric Bolling, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""If you didn't think it was possible, another twist in Hillary Clinton's e- mail scandal. Colin Powell breaking his silence on the matter, saying she's trying to make him the fall guy. Now, as you may recall, Clinton has thrown around his name in defense of her use of a private e-mail server.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Secretary Powell has admitted he did exactly the same thing. He had such a distinguished record, you know. I have served my country as well. We both did the same thing. We know Colin Powell had a private e-mail account. Just recently, Colin Powell e- mails were retroactively classified from more than 10 years ago. And he said, that was an absurdity, I could not agree more.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So, there's that. And then, she even reportedly told the FBI that he was the one who suggested that she use a private account in the first place. So Powell is now saying that is not true. At an event this weekend, Powell was quoted as saying Clinton's people have been trying to pin it on me. The truth is she was using the private e-mail server for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did. This of course raises new questions as to whether Clinton lied to the FBI about who advised her to set up the server in the first place. Greg, I have a feeling Powell was like -- no more Mr. Nice Guy.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yes.PERINO: This has been going on for a year though. And then he just sort of said it as a side at an event over the weekend.GUTFELD: It makes sense that she's putting this all on a guy named Colin because she's so full of crap.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: You know what he reminds me of? You know when you're in line at the checkout and there's a fight at the checkout line and the person is like, looks at you for back-up and you're like I'm out of it, stay out of it. Do not pin it on me. The fact is you never pin a good thing on someone. So even Colin knows that this is a bad thing and he's like I'm not getting the blame for this. This is on you, lady. And why do you have to keep bringing me up. It's not fair. But the big story about this is the story was broken by People Magazine. This wasn't the New York Times or the Washington Post. That means that the new Woodward and Bernstein were writing about the Kardashian's behind all this time.PERINO: And they happened to get a scoop.GUTFELD: They got a scoop, too.PERINO: In the Hamptons.EBONI WILLIAMS, GUEST CO-HOST: The cool kids have a name for this. They say keep my name out of your mouth. This is Colin Powell essentially telling Hillary Clinton keep my name out of your mouth. A huge distinction here and Hillary Clinton actually said it. Colin Powell had a private e- mail account. She had private e-mail servers operating from her home. That's very, very different. And furthermore, the whole he did it too argument, to me, that's the opposite of leadership. To the extent that there were some similarities at all, that's just a lame copout by Hillary.PERINO: She was trying, Eric, to basically use him as a shield.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Yeah. She's trying to do everything. Advice to Mrs. Clinton, stop with the e-mails, forget it, just start eating it. Don't start blaming other people. You know what we found out today? The FBI found 15,000 additional -- not the 30,000 that they scrubbed already, 15,000 additional e-mails that she never admitted to having. And now, as we are working through these, I have some of the ideas here that I know we're going to get through in a bit.GUTFELD: Baby pictures.BOLLING: This is unbelievable.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Yeah, no baby pictures. And so, far no yoga plans or wedding plans.PERINO: Kimberly, when it comes to what she told the FBI and what now we are hearing what Colin Powell said, can they re-open this and look back and say maybe I was wrong?GUILFOYLE: Whoever came up with this, pin the tail on Colin Powell was ill advising Hillary Clinton because now they might have set themselves up for the greatest slam dunk perjury case of all time. Because for him to come out, he's very low to criticizing the Clinton's, he is always more reserved about things. He said, OK, it's enough for me already actually. And it is distinguishable what Secretary Powell did at the time versus Secretary Clinton because he used a commercial e-mail address to discuss personal matters with family and friends, and did not put State Department business on a personal or commercial e-mail address. He complied in terms of the information that was relayed to protect national security. What you've seen here is Hillary Clinton making a mockery of national security and you know, it's all about yoga mats and downward dogs. But you know what, people that know the truth and the difference about what matters and take our national security seriously don't find her funny.PERINO: Plus there's a huge difference, Greg, between e-mail use in 2002 and when she became Secretary of State in 2009. We didn't even have Blackberries in the administration until well after 9/11. So I think that she is -- you're trying to find behind a Secretary of State who's usually very diplomatic.GUTFELD: Yeah. It's a sign. You remember when your mom used to say just because Billy says jump off a bridge doesn't mean you have to. This is what she's doing. She is like saying he did it first. He did it first. It is the most primitive.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: But it's also dishonest.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: He used the State Department e-mails for all conducted State Department business.PERINO: And he didn't delete them on the way out the door.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: No, this is so night and day different. And you know what, she's ruining his reputation or trying to, doing her level best to, being reckless, being a loose relationship with the truth and they should take the matter back.PERINO: He's 79 years old and saying enough of that. There's also more to come on the Hillary Clinton e-mails. One of the things that people are looking at is the Clinton Global Initiative. There was news on that over the weekend and Donald Trump called on them to stop it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Number one, they should shut it down. Number two, they should give the money back to a lot of countries that we shouldn't be taking and they shouldn't be taking money from, countries that influenced her totally. And also, countries that discriminate against women and gays, and everybody else. I mean, that money should be given back. They should not take that money.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Also today, Eric, Bill Clinton saying that he will step down if she becomes president. But at this point, I guess the foundation did what it was supposed to do.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Here's what they're signaling. They're saying hurry up and get your donation in before November for influence. If you want influence, get it in now and watch the donations come pouring in before this potentially event where he can no longer be a part of it.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: So quid pro quo, some of the 15,000 e-mails, we found out the crown prince of Bahrain wanted a meeting with the Secretary of State. He was told to wait. He dropped $26 million to the Clinton Foundation, gets the meeting with the Secretary of State. There's a British footballer who got in trouble for doing something in England, wanted to meet with the Secretary of State also. A donation helped make that happen or at least opened the door to where eventually they got to work some things out with the State Department. We already knew about the $145 million that went into the Clinton Foundation. That was just after the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton okayed a deal to sell 20 to 25 percent of U.S. uranium production to the Russians. Think about some of -- these are textbook business school quid pro quos.GUILFOYLE: Pay for play.BOLLING: Even worse. Until James Rosen today asked the question at the State Department. Did you hear that question? There's an e-mail in one of those 15,000 e-mails, an e-mail going from the Clinton Foundation operative, I can't remember to who it was, to Mills.PERINO: Cheryl Mills.BOLLING: Cheryl Mills. The e-mail says, hey, can you ask our boss if she can do this, meaning Clinton Foundation.PERINO: Right.BOLLING: Hillary Clinton, boss, State Department, Hillary Clinton boss. She can't have both of those titles. She can't. And that exposes them.GUILFOYLE: But she did.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Her campaign manager, Robby Mook, tried to answer some of these questions yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBBY MOOK, CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR HILLARY CLINTON: We have Republicans in Congress and right wing groups doing everything they can to try to make something out of nothing here. The fact is that at every juncture, the foundation has gone above and beyond what is usually in place in terms of ethics and rules for a foundation like this. When President Bush, the second president Bush, came into office, you never heard people asking questions about his family's foundation, which was a very similar situation and members of his family remained on the board of their foundation while he was president. So what we're just asking for is for people to take a fair look at the situation.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I'm taking a fair look, Greg. I mean, Laura Bush, the former first lady, was not then serving as the Secretary of State.GUTFELD: How do you know that?(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I don't think there are any records of that.PERINO: There are no records of that?GUTFELD: They were actually thrown out. Look, my question is where does this go from here? Because I don't think the media is doing quite the job they're supposed to in this arena of looking at the Clinton Foundation or the Clinton Global Initiative which is CGI, which is interesting, because it's special effects to alter reality. The only way this is going to come apart is at the debate because Trump will have to force her to answer the questions that the media doesn't, because so far in this game of Whack-A- Mole, the mole hasn't shown up. You can't hit the mole because it's never there, but on the debate, the mole is going to have to come up.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: The mole is trapped on the stage.PERINO: Former mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani and a support of Trump, Kimberly, basically said the Clinton Globe Al Initiative, he used the word bribery.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Do you think that will factor in to any FBI consideration or that's just water under the bridge?GUILFOYLE: Well, he is saying that not only as -- yeah, a former mayor but as a former prosecutor who's investigated and prosecuted racketeering and RICO violations. And he's saying what we saw here, this level of corruption is so overt that it rises to the same level and would warrant a very thorough and fair investigation and potentially indictment.BOLLING: Under RICO?GUILFOYLE: That's what I just said. That's what he's saying. He thinks there is definitely a case to be made for it, but you don't see them climbing over themselves to try and even properly investigate it. If it was anybody else, but the Clintons, they would.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: There is further information, Eboni, that basically, the Justice Department having seen all these information heard from the FBI repeatedly and has said there's nothing to see here at the Clinton Global Initiative. We have checked in, everything is fine and they just let it go.WILLIAMS: Yeah. And so, to break it down, too, Dana, like the Clinton Foundation, they've done great work. And I think that's important to note, but, KG, you know about this legal doctrine.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: We all have learned in law school, fruit of the poisonous tree.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: And that's really big here. That's really big here because for people that really don't understand the big deal.PERINO: What is the fruit of the poisonous tree?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Don't eat it.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: When it goes through corruption even if it's doing good work or good will or it's valuable, it's corrupt, it's tainted. And therefore, it can't be used the same way.PERINO: Even if you built a bunch of Clinton water wells in Africa, it doesn't matter?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: That's right.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: All that good stuff that the Clinton Foundation has done, the method in which you've got those resources is so foul and so corrupt and so just horrible that we have to take that into consideration.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: That's very important.BOLLING: Yeah. It's like the drug king pin opening up a playground for the kids over there. It's a similar example. But also, Charity Navigator, that's a website that issues -- it scores different charities. In 2015, they backed out and said we can't even attempt to rate the Clinton Foundation anymore because there's no transparency.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I think we did that story.PERINO: We never knew it would get to be this big.BOLLING: And I have a hunch if you continue with these e-mails you'll find more and more of a lack of transparency.PERINO: We're going to move on. Before we go, I just want to tell you this, the Judicial Watch who's filing all these lawsuits, bringing all this information to light, the judge said that the Clintons have until October 14th to -- they must submit these questions by October 14th. So Judicial Watch sends questions to Clinton by October 14. And the judge says she has, guess what, 30 days, 30 days in which to answer, which would put it beyond the general election.GUILFOYLE: Unbelievable.PERINO: There we go. All right. Donald Trump has been making some changes to his campaign as the general election nears. And as he is walking back his hard line on illegal immigration, you're going to hear from the Republican nominee himself when The Five returns.BOLLING: He's here?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: One of my favorites of all time. All right. Last week, Donald Trump admitted he had regrets about things he said this election cycle. Is he now planning to soften his stance on a signature issue of his campaign? He had a meeting with Hispanic leaders over the weekend. The Republican nominee reportedly indicated he would find a way to legalize undocumented immigrants. But this morning on Fox News, Trump insisted his immigration policy is not changing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We have to be very firm. We have to be very, very strong when people come in illegally. We have a lot of people that want to come in through the legal process. It's not fair for them. And we're working with a lot of people in the Hispanic community to try and come up with an answer.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you're not flip-flopping?TRUMP: No, I'm not flip-flopping. We have to come up with a fair but firm answer. It has to be very firm.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: His new campaign manager, however, left the door open.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: What he supports is to make sure that we enforce the law, that we are respectful of those Americans who are looking for well paying jobs, and that we are fair and humane for those who live among us in this country. As the weeks unfold, he will lay out the specifics of that plan that he would implement as president of the United States.DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Will that plan include a deportation force, the kind that you just heard in that sound bite and that he talked about during the Republican Primary?CONWAY: To be determined.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: TBD. So, Dana, how about the messaging there? You have the candidate, the nominee, saying that in fact he's going to no, not change the position et cetera. But then we've got information saying that he will and then, Kellyanne Conway who has taken over his campaign manager, a little bit of a different message. How do you reconcile it?PERINO: Well, we thought we were going to get more information because what Dana Bash was asking Kellyanne Conway was is he going to lay this out on Thursday at a speech in Colorado where he's going to be speaking. And she says to be determined. So that's OK, we will get some clarity. But then, we find out today he's no longer going to be giving a speech on immigration. He's just going to do a fundraising event in Colorado which is an important state for him to try to win. So I think -- I don't know. When I listen to him on Fox & Friends, I feel like he still left the door open for changes, but then he doesn't want people that supported him for his earlier stance about deporting possibly up to 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants, who have been in the country for a period of time, who came here illegally and that have been here for a while so-called in the shadows. Actually, I don't know what his position is.GUILFOYLE: All right. Eric, how do you reconcile it? And then also he's saying you know I want to be fair to the people who stand in line and wait et cetera, to follow the law and comply with the legal requirements for citizenship in this country?BOLLING: Well, look, I don't know how he does it. Because right now, the two things he has to do if he becomes president, he has to build a wall, he can't back off on that, and he has to get Mexico to pay for it. Those are two things he can't -- there's no wiggle room in those. He said it time and time again. As far as the deportation, he said it with Morning Joe and Mika a few months ago, several months ago, I don't know if he can turn on it. Maybe he can, I'm not sure. Maybe he can say I've been advised by Kellyanne Conway and some of the other advisers that this is the way we need to soften it. But he may risk his base because his base loves the idea of deporting all 12 million people who are here illegally. So I'm not sure how you do that politically. I have no idea how to do that. I will tell you though, it shouldn't overshadow what happened last week. Last week, he had an African-American outreach that was probably one of the best pivots I've ever seen in politics, where he's having a hard time with African-Americans, no doubt, and he goes to Michigan, and he makes this speech saying what the hell -- why not give me a try, what could possibly.GUILFOYLE: What do you have to lose?BOLLING: What do you have to lose?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: He should do that in every city. He should do that in Detroit.GUTFELD: But to black people, not just the white people.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Right. I think that's who he's talking to. Go the Cleveland, go to the cities where African-Americans have had 50 years in these cities and the unemployment is higher, the unemployment is higher, and things are not better. He actually has a chance to make changes and pivot towards more diversity.GUILFOYLE: Greg, you've talked about this before when you pointed out that there are Democrats in charge of so many of these failing cities with liberal policies which have not produced economic growth. When you look at Detroit and other places that are struggling like Chicago, et cetera, where there is a tremendous amount of violence.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: You're pivoting away from the story.WILLIAMS: That's funny, Greg.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Answer all of it.GUTFELD: No, no, I'm not answering any of it. I'm going to stick to what Kellyanne Conway said which was she gave the Trump campaign a new slogan, to be determined. That's exactly what this campaign is, to be determined. And that is not a criticism by the way. Because he glides from event to event with impulsive opinions, every promise that he makes is actually a negotiation position. He says this thing and then he goes, maybe I'll change my mind. If you actually believed that he was going to deport 11 million people, that's on you. You probably believe that was Ryan Lochte's original hair. The fact is there was no possible way he was ever going to do it. He was feeding his hungry base which has always been his problem. He should have stopped feeding them and started an outreach to the Hispanics. By the way, I'm glad he met with a group of Hispanics. I hear it was one of the first times he didn't ask them to mow his lawn, so that was good.WILLIAMS: I want to say this.GUILFOYLE: OK.WILLIAMS: something I think is very important here. I applaud your point, Greg, I applaud the Trump campaign for taking a step back and actually trying to figure out something that's in their words fair but firm. What's not OK is when we're inconsistent, we will probably evaluate that. Trump doesn't get to say now I want to take something that considers a possible way for some of these immigrants to get into America and that be considered firm and fair. But there's another candidate that says the other side by the way that's amnesty. That's amnesty like. I think we need to be very, very consistent. And you know, stop demonizing when people want to take a step back and look at it from a reasonable standpoint.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Right now, he has more positions than the Kama Sutra on immigration and it's OK. It's OK. That's his thing. It's about negotiation.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Name one position.PERINO: Stop it.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: He doesn't know. All right.Ahead, President Obama will visit flood ravaged Baton Rouge tomorrow but what took him so long? He is under fire for hitting golf balls while Louisiana got hit by the worst natural disaster since Super Storm Sandy, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: After 16 days on vacation and 10 rounds of golf, President Obama finally going to visit Louisiana tomorrow, a state absolutely devastated once again by flooding. At least 13 people have been killed and thousands displaced after severe storms hit more than a week ago. The president could have put down his golf clubs and headed south or at least appeared before cameras but he did neither. The White House defended the president earlier.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: What the president's been focused on is the response on the ground. The president was on the phone with the governor the Louisiana eight days ago to talk to him directly about how the state has been affected by the flooding. The effectiveness of the response thus far speaks for itself. And I think frankly, it's the most effective way to answer any of the politically motivated criticism that the president has faced.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Louisiana's Governor John Bel Edwards said he didn't tell the president not to come but recommended he visit once recovery efforts had begun. The governor offered praise for Donald Trump for changing his plans toward the state on Friday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BASH: Was it a good thing that he came down?JOHN BEL EDWARDS, LOUISIANA GOVERNOR: Well, I think, yeah, for the reasons that I stated earlier because it helped to shine a spotlight on Louisiana and on the dire situation that we have here that it was helpful.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So, Eboni, also the lieutenant governor was on TV today saying he was happy Donald Trump came. He would have welcomed President Obama had he come prior to this just to get the eyeballs on the area, and he said in many cases, in many reasons -- in many reasons that this is worse than Katrina because of the vastness of the flooding.WILLIAMS: Yeah. I was in Louisiana during Katrina, Eric. And certainly, this area that got hit is not used to and accustomed to this type of flooding, so that made it very different. A lot of people were questioning, I saw over the weekend, Trump's motivations. Is this Trump doing this for a photo op? It was reported that Louisiana governor was questioning that. But we see now that the he said thank you for coming. I actually don't care, Eric, about the purity of Donald Trump's intentions on this. Here's why. He'll be accountable to that to someone far greater than me and you. What's important is that eyeballs were on Louisiana because this story has been overshadowed by the Olympics and everything else that's going on. And my first cousin who's a mother of three, (inaudible), she has a new born, all of her contents of her home are on the front yard right now.GUILFOYLE: Oh, God.WILLIAMS: OK. There are thousands of people in that area. So whether Trump went for whatever reason, it really doesn't matter to me. It's important that he went and it's important that President Obama should have went, he should have went. I'm glad he's going tomorrow but he should have gone. Here's the reason why. It's good that he's been on the phone and operating behind the scenes, and getting them the resources they need from the federal government. And I do believe that. But when you are the leader of our country, it's important, people follow your lead. And so, when you show concern and you're visibly around this issue, it really ups the ante to the level of concern and awareness, and participation of the people affected. And I think that's very important.BOLLING: Dana, your thoughts, the lieutenant governor also said something that people may not have realized. Trump also left a sizable donation.PERINO: Well, if -- I mean, if he left a sizable donation, again, to your point in terms -- if that was because he was doing it out of his heart and we don't know about it, which means, that would be a good thing because he wasn't trying to use it for political purposes and I won't do that here either.I'm kind of over -- I think there should be a statute of limitations on scoring political points about hurricane Katrina. I know that the White House was asked earlier about it today, takes another swipe at Bush. I'm tired of taking swipes at Obama. But, I mean, there was a tragedy. It was catastrophic.You know, far be it for me to point out the Democratic governor and the Democratic mayor who've been gone done for corruption were the ones who are incompetent from the beginning. But FEMA did not do a good job and President Bush said he shouldn't have flown over. Let that picture be taken.But, overall, FEMA performed better now than they did eight years ago or 10 years ago, now 11 years since hurricane Katrina and that should be the good thing about government. I'm not worried about scoring political points on this one.BOLLING: Greg, should we not be leading this segment with President Obama still on the golf course?GUTFELD: Yeah. I don't -- I guess I don't think so because I often ask myself when we do the story if it didn't have a political bent. For example, I wonder how many people actually still think about that child in Syria that we talked about last week. A large portion probably didn't .GUILFOYLE: We showed the picture an hour ago.GUTFELD: Yeah, but then, you know .GUILFOYLE: Sad.GUTFELD: It is sad, but my point is this that unless the story bears political fruit, sometimes people in the media don't cover it. There are some interesting facts about this story.One -- I mean, one, a major hurricane hasn't hit the U.S. gulf or east coast in like a decade according to the ""Washington Post"" in there and -- but when they do hit, they tend to be worse because there are more people concentrated in areas. And ironically, the good point that they haven't happened makes people less ready when they do.WILLIAMS: That's right, in this area.GUTFELD: Yeah. So that's -- if you talk about the facts, it's actually more interesting and you are more helpful maybe.BOLLING: Yes, but let me play a little devil's advocate on that point of .GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: . theory there. The governor and lieutenant governor were both happy Trump came.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. Well, there's a right thing to do. The right thing to do is to go there and to see what's going on. I think anybody who would go and see the devastation and the families displaced and children, everyone's lives affected and what the churches are trying do to step in as well to help people, you would probably be moved if you had money to make a donation because your heart would see with through your eyes and say, ""What can I do to try and help elevate this suffering?""There is just really no substitute for going there in person and seeing and feeling and breathing and smelling the devastation of the flooding. It's horrible and the people that are just -- their whole lives are like erased like someone hit the delete button. So it's very, very difficult.The president should have gone there. I think the whole world knows it. You know you're in trouble, the president when even the cartoons of liberal newspapers and what not are putting stuff out there with him golfing of, you know .BOLLING: Let me thrown idea here, Madam Secretary, who wants to be president and has a lot of money at your disposal, the Clinton Foundation, New Orleans, Louisiana, the people of Louisiana, Baton Rouge, could use a little help. Maybe they open up the coffers of the Clinton Foundation for some people down south. Quick thought.WILLIAMS: Their last thought to Dana's point to the extent that I believe George W. Bush should have come to Louisiana. This is an opportunity for President Obama to learn from that. You know, that's OK. It's OK to say .PERINO: (Inaudible) could be the only thing about President Bush going is should he have gone on that day.WILLIAMS: He did go.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Oh, no, absolutely. I said he was rebuild.WILLIAMS: Of course.PERINO: If you wanted to talk -- we could get political and talk about the fact that the NAACP for example has just stripped out support of all charter schools. That's part of its platform now.Rebuilding New Orleans was also not just about the levies, but about the entire city and part of that the catholic school rehabilitation and the charter school thing.WILLIAMS: That's the part of all of that. I'm not saying that needs to be political, but I'm saying -- I think you just said, you know, looking back on it the flyover was not good.PERINO: On that particular day, no.WILLIAMS: On that particular day. So I'm saying President Obama should look at that part of history and learn something from that and say just like that wasn't the best choice in my opinion.PERINO: Well, he did when he was running for office the first and the second time.WILLIAMS: We're trying to put, you know, that in a way that matters to people. It seemed like a missed opportunity.BOLLING: All right, while they're wrapping us, I'll give you one more, one more. How about it, Madam Secretary? How about sending some money from the Clinton Foundation to the people of Louisiana?Still to come, some bad news for American swimmer Ryan Lochte after his Rio robbery story unraveled. Lots of ours details ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Last week after Donald Trump made a speech, CNN ran this headline: ""Trump wants GOP to court black voters, then slams voting rights for felons."" That's weird.The key word there is then for it links both issues, that if you want black votes, why would you stop felons from voting? CNN's implication is that blacks and felons are one in the same. It's amazing.The headline's a concise example of the subtle racism of the liberal media where any reference to crime is a black thing, not just a human thing.Now, imagine using this bigoted headline in other ways:""Clinton wants Jewish vote, then slams greedy bankers""""Gary Johnson courts the Irish, but condemns heavy drinking""""Trump appeals to Hispanics, then calls illegals rapists""Well actually, that happened with Trump at his campaign launch when he conflated Mexico sending criminals here with all illegals.So, how is the CNN headline in any different than that? Well, with the Republicans, everything is always racist, but when its mainstream liberalism, it's thoughtful, which explains why so many cities under thoughtful liberal rule are near ruin.If you view crime as a racial thing and not a human thing, any act to solve it is seen as racial, which hurts the law-abiding folks who don't see race in crime. They just see the lives made worse by those who find politics in their pain.Imagine, Eric, if FNC ran a headline like that.BOLLING: That would be terrible. Can I take exception to one comment in your monologue there when Trump -- you said Trump said that his campaign launch about all illegals. I'm not sure he said all.GUTFELD: No, you know .(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: They are part of the illegal population coming up or otherwise that would be like 9.6 million rapist and murderer.GUTFELD: Yeah. No, but that's what the way he said it's conflated. I'm not saying he meant it. I'm saying he conflated it.BOLLING: Yeah. So, was this -- this was a -- was this a tweet?GUTFELD: That was the headline.BOLLING: A headline piece?GUTFELD: And it was still up there as I was writing it.BOLLING: You know, they should probably retract that. They did, right?GUTFELD: I don't know, but, you know, when I wrote it, it was still up.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah. He might attend that (inaudible).GUTFELD: Maybe on Sunday when they do -- is it reliable sources? Brian Stelter can do an hour on this headline.GUILFOYLE: There you go. What producing? You've already done the rundown for him.GUTFELD: That's exactly.GUILFOYLE: That's perfect.WILLIAMS: And it's only Monday.BOLLING: That is true.GUTFELD: So?WILLIAMS: So I don't like .GUTFELD: Got anything?WILLIAMS: I got (ph), sure. So, I don't like the headline. But I'll say this, as a criminal defense lawyer, there is an intersection though, Greg, of race and crime and the law and how that all intersects.The truth is we know that certain laws do adversely effect and disproportionately affect the black community, but the majority of disenfranchised felon voters in this country are white. So it was actually also just wrong accurately.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: You know it's problematic. It would be absolutely problematic. There was the other way around and it's true. We need to look and we need to be very careful, I think is the lesson for everybody here.And the language, because what we say matters and how we say it matters and how it's perceived matters, too, I think that the issue Trump has and going back to your point earlier, Eric, Trump gave a great speech last week about his intention to operate and move the black community forward. And I think a lot of people were happy to hear that.I think Donald Trump still has an intention problem when it comes to the black community. And he's not alone in that. I think Hillary Clinton does, too. And that's why her trustworthy numbers are where they are and that's why Bernie Sanders had a lot of support from people that really were not interested in Hillary Clinton.But I think if Trump is -- at all serious about having black voters or Hispanic voters turn out and support him this November, which I think he could get absolutely, he's got to kind of address that and kind of connect some of these dots for that.GUTFELD: Dana, is it too late?PERINO: Well, I don't -- of course, it's not too late. He's got 10 weeks left. So there's like 79 days left to the election. But, he does have a 91 percent on average, 91 percent disapproval rating with the African- American community.GUTFELD: That's up from 99.PERINO: You could improve upon .GUTFELD: It is.PERINO: Yeah, it is, right. That was one poll in one state, Pennsylvania, and it was several weeks ago. But could he chip away at that? Could he improve? Yes, but I think also the audience matters, right?GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: So that is a good -- that is a great speech to give after you have one-on-one meeting with the group of people that looks a little different from where you are standing in front of 95 percent white crowd giving the speech saying that African-American -- I know that the speech was good, but it was not taken well by the audience for which it was intended.WILLIAMS: And because they distrust Trump, he's in trouble. Yeah, that's the thing.PERINO: Maybe that's why.GUILFOYLE: He got to start somewhere .BOLLING: Yeah, that's true.GUILFOYLE: . and you have to do outreach. I think it is so important, you know, even if you get three votes from that community, try and do it. Try and earn votes.Try and show people that they matter because everybody cares no matter what your religion or what your ethnicity about good schools and about jobs and providing for their family and living in safe communities where they can go out at night and walk the dog, you know, or pretend they had a dog to walk, whatever.GUTFELD: I pretend to have a dog.GUILFOYLE: Like Greg. Your small ferret.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: That's fine.GUTFELD: Time (ph) to go home.GUILFOYLE: But, you know, that's what matters, right? If he ignored it, then he would be criticized. I want to see people try to earn the vote, make it count.GUTFELD: All right, we got to move on. Next, Ryan Lochte says he's sorry for telling tales to Brazil. Now he's being robbed of his sponsorships back home. Is that fair?WILLIAMS: Wrong.GUILFOYLE: Of Speedo.GUTFELD: Yes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: The 2016 summer Olympic Games came to a close last night in Rio with one of team USA's athletes here tries to close book on his fabricated robbery controversy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RYAN LOCHTE, OLYMPIC SWIMMER: If I didn't over exaggerate the story and if I told the entire story, none of this would have happened.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: In a televised interview Ryan Lochte apologized directly to the people of Brazil. The fallout for the swimmer continues here at home. He lost two huge sponsors today, Speedo and Ralph Lauren. TMZ caught up with Lochte earlier.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you going to consider rehab or AA?LOCHTE: You know, I don't know. I can't answer that question right now.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Speedo, you know, has dropped you and they released a statement about it. What are you going to be wearing in the pool going forward?LOCHTE: I heard about that and, you know, it stinks us. Speedo was great to me. They were like a second family throughout my swimming career. And, you know, I guess it's a new chapter now.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: OK. So during that, Dana was like, for what, right, why is he going to go to AA? Apparently, he admitted that he was still intoxicated when he gave the interview the following morning, so I think a lot of people are reading a lot into that.But what I'm more concerned with is he blamed this whole debacle on, ""immature behavior."" Now, we know Ryan Lochte is 32 years old. I am as well. And I consider .GUILFOYLE: You're much more .WILLIAMS: I never do that. But I consider him as adult, so I just feel like that's like, come on, don't give like a bad rap.PERINO: I mean, but you can be 32 and be immature.WILLIAMS: And be immature?PERINO: I mean you can. I mean you would never be.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: No, he could.PERINO: Look, I think when you do something wrong in most situations there are consequences, especially if you are at your employer or with your sponsors. And so he's paid a price. He's also -- I think he's pretty sincere in his apologies. So maybe we can -- after tomorrow let this one go?WILLIAMS: Eric, is this us blowing -- us being like, you know, the U.S. and the media, is this blowing this whole thing out of Ryan to stay in the water?BOLLING: No.WILLIAMS: No?BOLLING: Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.WILLIAMS:BOLLING: You listen. When you sign up for these endorsements, this is a free market at work.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: When you sign up for these endorsements, there's -- either its written or unwritten there is a responsibility on your part not to do things like ripping -- getting really wasted, ripping posters down when you're drunk with your friends. You just -- you don't do that or you risk that. Or you risk other things like going to jail.WILLIAMS: And lying about it.BOLLING: Yeah. So the lying about a thing, you know, the USA today may have a little more backing on what he actually said. Clearly, he put his hair back to the original color. He's eaten to taking full responsibility for all former (ph) swimmers.Someone is doing damage control on it right now, but the free market will take some of those endorsements away and guess what who is waiting right in the wings? Nike or Under Armour is waiting to get that bathing suit contract in his hands to sign for the 2020 Olympics.WILLIAMS: Yeah. So to that, let's talk about the money K.G., money, money, money.GUILFOYLE: Money, money.WILLIAMS: OK, so we've lost big dollars today, but moving forward if he's going to be in a position you think to get that back, to rebrand himself and move forward to 2020? He intends to. He said that he intends to keep swimming and even if he's suspended, you know, they put together an investigative committee.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: The U.S. committee, you know, on this. Is this going to hurt him or can he come back?GUILFOYLE: He totally is going to come back from that.WILLIAMS: OK.GUILFOYLE: So this is the story now. He's obviously very sorry and, you know, young guys like that, even that, you know, he's been training forever to do the whole Olympics thing, there's a lot of self and personal sacrifice that goes into it.I get the whole, you know, blow off team (ph) this is why you have to travel with security. Don't get your security when you're at that level, because they're going -- one, they're going to be like, OK, that's it, you know, and .WILLIAMS: Well, you're done.GUILFOYLE: . and get you back in, back to the hotel, enough is enough. We don't need anymore like embarrass America stuff. That being the case, he'll get endorsement and stuff in the future.He's obviously trying to like, deal with it, crisis control, a little bit of reputation management. And the reason why they ask him about rehab is everybody who says, ""OK, when they have a personal crisis, blame it on now. Call, go to rehab to try and like clean it up and attribute that to it."" So, I don't know if he's going to do that's why he goes, ""I can't really answer that question right now."" Right?WILLIAMS: Good point. Greg, let me ask you because I'm actually kind of skeptical on this, everyone is like he really is sorry. I don't know that I believe he is really sorry, here is why. The language, I over- exaggerated. I mean, you lie, then maybe it's -- for me, its better if you just say, ""I lied and I'm sorry.""GUTFELD: Well, the problem is over-exaggeration. It's not a word. How do you over-exaggerate? That's like I'm only going to dig half a hole. It makes no sense at all. And it just -- another point, better that Speedo drop you than you drop Speedo.(CROSSTALK)GUTFLED: But, you know, the interesting thing is, why did Speedo need endorsements? Just like there is no Pepsi in the Speedo world. It's either Speedo or no Speedo. You're either an Olympic swimmer wearing a Speedo or you're a fat German tourist at south beach wearing a Speedo. It's the only time you ever see a Speedo.WILLIAMS: Now you've done it. You got Germany again.PERINO: On that note, ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing,"" Greg.GUTFELD: All right, time for something new. Here it is. ""Greg's Musical News,"" with Greg Gutfeld. I hate saxophones, by the way.Anyway, this is interesting. Koko is a famous primate. It's known for knowing hundreds of words and sign language and all sorts of stuff and actually joined Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers to play a song and I don't know if we have some tape here or you'll just stare at me for a while.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It sounds like -- that's it.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: All right, as most people -- musicians know, this is a vast improvement over the Red Hot Chili Peppers.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: You should do the story, you know. No, because Gutfeld is going to say -- the ape is better to play.GUTFELD: If there is some ape who is better than Anthony Kiedis. Why would -- the ape is 45, which is happy age of Anthony Kiedis. Red Hot Chili Peppers, poor man's Faith No More, don't ever forget it.GUILFOYLE: Oh, that's a great new attention .(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Kind of debate on this one day. I'll just want to say something - - one more thing about the Olympics and that is about the refugee team. This is a team that it was the first time they ever competed. It was created from four countries, Ethiopia, Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Sudan.They came together as a team and competed. They did not win any medals, but they did get a nice, wonderful bit of applause at the closing ceremony. I just want to wish them very well as they continue on. Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Thank you so much. I love this one more thing. Thank you (inaudible). This is so important. Dana, I think you're going to love it.So a female U.S. sailor was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, which is very significant, earlier this month for her brave that during January incident if you recall that resulted in Iran detaining 10 Americans.So the sailor who is ask not to be identified with the only female among that, the two crews of the Navy riverine boats that entered the Iranian waters. Anyway, she managed to activate the emergency beacon, while she was bound and held and at some point which then signaled to the U.S. and fact that they were in trouble.Iranians, you know, later discovered and turned it off. Then anyway, she's a petty officer, second class. It was the number two gunner on the second boat during the January 2nd incident and the military said she just played extraordinary courage. I wish you all safety with that.PERINO: Good for her. All right, Eric.BOLLING: So, while I was being lame all day about my memoir, I think criticism like you have to come up to something just do this one, so here it is. 13 out of 15 dogs would prefer good boy vocal praise over a treat and that's not the headline of the story, the headline of the story is that this study was conducted by Emory University, one of the best high learning institutions in the country, and they took five years to come up .GUILFOYLE: I don't think this is true.GUILFOYLE: This is not true.BOLLING: . with this results.WILLIAMS: Actually, my dog likes to lick my feet instead of treats. OK, so I'm going to do a quick talk here. I'm actually guest host for Alan Colmes, tonight on Fox News Radio at 6:00. Check that out.And this is a cute story. So a 9-year-old that instead of birthday present, this is a 9-year-old from Acadiana, Louisiana, ""Mom save my birthday money. Give me money to donate to the flood victims."" Instead, he had his mother buy pizza and they ended up getting a match from a local pizzeria and they gave out almost 400 pizzas to the victims.PERINO: Amazing.GUILFOYLE: It's kind of awesome.WILLIAMS: Absolutely.GUILFOYLE: God bless.PERINO: All right, tomorrow on ""The Five,"" Libertarian Party nominee, Gary Johnson joins us right here on our studio so make sure you tune in for that. That's it for us. ""Special Report"" is next.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
