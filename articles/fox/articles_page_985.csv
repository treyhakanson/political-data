This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, the all-important Iowa caucuses are only 26 days away, and two Republican hopefuls are battling it out for the top spot now in the Hawkeye State. According to the RealClearPolitics Iowa average, Texas Senator Ted Cruz currently maintains a small lead, with 31 percent of the vote, while Donald Trump is close behind with 27.4 percent.Meanwhile, the RealClearPolitics national average shows Donald Trump with a commanding 15-point lead over the two-way race potentially forming in Iowa.  Donald Trump appears to be going on the offensive.In an interview yesterday. Trump suggested that the presidential eligibility of Ted Cruz may be challenged because he was born in Canada, telling The Washington Post, quote, ""Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question, do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years? It'd be a very precarious one for Republicans because he'd be running, and the courts may take a long time to make a decision.  You don't want to be running and have that kind of thing hanging over your head.""And Trump went on to add, quote, ""I'd hate to see something like this get in his way, but a lot of people are talking about it and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly, that the fact that he was born in Canada and he has a double passport.""Now, Senator Ted Cruz responded in typical fashion. He simply tweeted out this clip from the old show, ""Happy Days."" Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There he goes!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And joining us with reaction from The Washington Times, Charles Hurt, editor-in-chief of Lifezette.com, Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham and Fox News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera.Laura, I'll start with you. You and Geraldo are the lawyers on this.  Where do you stand? I see no issue here for Ted Cruz.LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, there's no issue whatsoever. He has dual citizenship, Sean, because his mom is a U.S. citizen, so he gets naturalized citizen as a result of that.This has already been looked into. In fact, on my radio show today, Chris Christie came to the defense of Ted Cruz, noting that -- I guess at a rally, that -- one of those Iran rallies on Capitol Hill, I believe even Donald Trump, according to Christie, had acknowledged that, you know, Ted Cruz of course was eligible, and just because he was born in Canada, in this case, his mom...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: He gave up his Canadian citizenship. Geraldo, you think there might be something to this.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: I totally disagree. I think that Trump is brilliant to raise this issue. When my son, Gabriel, and his wife, Deb, was pregnant, I said, You got to come home. I want my grandson to be president of the United States. He has to be born in the United States.Now, a child of a citizen of the United States born abroad or born wheresoever is a citizen if that's -- he or she so chooses. So there's no doubt but that Ted Cruz is a citizen of the United States.HANNITY: But that would mean the morning he's born...RIVERA: But he has to be...HANNITY: ... that's natural-born.RIVERA: But he has to be a natural-born...HANNITY: But that is natural-born.RIVERA: All right, let's go back. The Naturalization Act of 1790, three years after the Constitution, said the children of citizens shall be considered natural born citizens. That's in 1790. Five years later, in 1795, they amended the Naturalization Act of 1795 and said the children of citizens, wherever born, are citizens is (ph) excluded the phrase ""natural- born citizens"" when they amended the act!(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: That's a stretch. Come on.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: Trump is right when he says it has never, with all due respect to Laura...INGRAHAM: Geraldo...(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: ... never been litigated!(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: Sean, Sean...HANNITY: John McCain wasn't born in the United StatesRIVERA: People aren't listening. It has never been litigated...HANNITY: I understand...(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: Trump is absolutely right...INGRAHAM: Geraldo, Geraldo...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: One at a time. Laura.INGRAHAM: Geraldo believes that a federal court is going to rule that Ted Cruz is not eligible to run for the presidency. I'm loving this. I want to see the federal court...(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: A federal court has never ruled...INGRAHAM: Yes, but you're inferring...RIVERA: A federal court has to rule.INGRAHAM: You're inferring by the absence of language, which is a sometimes used statutory interpretation tool, but it's not a very effective one, that...HANNITY: Why did they drop the phrase ""natural born""?INGRAHAM: ... that the absence of language...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: By the way, Trump even said the courts should declare he is a citizen.RIVERA: And Trump is right that this is a huge distraction!HANNITY: It's not -- I don't think so. Charles, you want to weigh in?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Listen...CHARLES HURT, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Ted Cruz has a larger problem here.  The problem here is that he is incapable of responding to Donald Trump with anything other than some sort of passive-aggressive goofy little film clip from ""Happy Days,"" which is sort of what we've seen this entire campaign.  Until he learns to land a real blow on Donald Trump, until anybody...HANNITY: Charles, I think you...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I have agreed with you all throughout the process. I think you're wrong here.INGRAHAM: I agree.HANNITY: If you look at Trump's attacks on Jeb Bush, they've been pretty devastating. Same thing with Ben Carson, even Marco. I think Ted Cruz by, Oh, I'm just going to laugh it off, has been the best response of anybody.HURT: Yes, I don't disagree with you that this is probably not going to be a very effective attack on Ted Cruz, but what I'm saying is that until somebody steps up and actually has a forceful attack on Donald Trump and actually takes him down a notch, Donald Trump is just going to keep plowing through...INGRAHAM: Charlie, why is that good for the anti-establishment candidate to be shooting at each other? I would argue something different. I would argue that the two of them should work together until it's down to the two of them, until they clear-cut the field of Jeb, Marco, Kasich and anyone else who's left over in the gutter of politics.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: ... going to take the rose -- the blush off the rose of Ted Cruz.  I think that the, He's not even a natural-born citizen, argument will resonate for at least the next few weeks.HANNITY: I think -- I think you're going birther ballistic, and I don't think it's going to work.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: All right, let's talk about where this campaign goes -- 26 days.  Now we're getting down to the game beginning. If I had to guess, I would say probably Cruz has the advantage in Iowa. But moving on from there, I would say it then becomes Donald Trump territory in New Hampshire. Laura, your reaction?INGRAHAM: I think Trump could surprise people in Iowa. Probably not, but you know, you've been to those caucuses, Sean. I have. These are raucous -- these are raucous events if there's a movement. The one that I would point to is the Obama caucus in 2008. Everyone thought Hillary was a shoo- in. When I walked out of that Des Moines high school, I said to my friend from college, It's going to be Obama. They were going crazy for Obama in Des Moines. So who knows. I mean, I think Cruz has an amazing organization...HANNITY: But passion for Trump, though -- the passion is...RIVERA: You cannot -- you cannot...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... 50 percent of Trump supporters that won't vote for anybody else.INGRAHAM: Right.HANNITY: So he has more passion on his side than any other candidate.RIVERA: I would argue Trump is the Obama of this cycle.HANNITY: Well, look at the crowds.RIVERA: I think that there is tremendous charisma, there's tremendous energy there...HANNITY: Is that your endorsement? Are you supporting Donald Trump?RIVERA: I'm not ready to nearly go there. It would just -- we haven't even started...HANNITY: What do you mean not nearly ready? Is he...INGRAHAM: Nearly? What?HANNITY: ... in your top two?RIVERA: He's definitely in my top two. There is no doubt in my view that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee.HANNITY: All right, so do you think -- do you think he'd be a good president?RIVERA: I think he'd be a great president.HANNITY: Yes.RIVERA: Being a president is being a CEO, essentially. I mean, he has some hateful ideas that really bug the hell out of me, and you all know what they are. We don't need to...HANNITY: Here we go, immigration again...(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: ... Trump is a wonderful negotiator...HANNITY: Laura, what do you think? Would he...RIVERA: ... an organized, brilliant businessman.INGRAHAM: Oh, my God. OK, first of all, I think Trump -- this is, like, the first -- I'm just teasing you, Geraldo -- bad news that Trump has gotten in a long time!(LAUGHTER)INGRAHAM: Oh, my God, you got Geraldo saying...RIVERA: That's good! That's good!INGRAHAM: ... that he's his guy? Wait a second. I'm going to leave right now, Sean...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: You're taking off?INGRAHAM: I don't know what to say about...(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)INGRAHAM: I think -- I think Geraldo is right, though. It's Cruz and Trump until the establishment or unless the establishment figures rally around one person. I still think the best person for them to rally around is Chris Christie. Chris Christie would be the most interesting...RIVERA: I agree with you on that, too.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: There's a lot of attacks now against him because he is doing well in Iowa. He's now in double digit in two polls. All right, Charles...HANNITY: He's going to handle heroin like no one can handle it (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: You know what the amazing thing is, Charles, is everyone predicted Trump's demise. And I actually talked to a real establishment person over the holidays, and I just said to them, You don't get it. You don't understand what's going on out there.There's a reason Trump and Cruz are one and two and that they take nearly 50 percent of the Republican electorate away in these polls because there's real palpable anger out there and frustration and a feeling of betrayal.HURT: And those establishment people have been wrong at every single turn with every single one of these predictions. And now what they're saying is, is that, Well, OK, if we go with him as the nominee, he's going to get slaughtered by Hillary Clinton. Well, is he really? I don't know that that's true.(CROSSTALK)HURT: ... look at the way he went after Bill Clinton. The first time in Bill Clinton's entire political career...HANNITY: He was speechless.HURT: He has been silenced!HANNITY: It took him five seconds to recover. All right, Laura, does Donald Trump put in play New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania? Do we look at an entirely different electoral map?INGRAHAM: I think -- you know, I read what Craig Shirley (ph) is writing on this, Reagan biographer.HANNITY: I read that today.INGRAHAM: He's talking about -- yes, the movement election. He wrote about it on Lifezette. You know, a movement election is a different type of election. It's an election where the people start moving into a direction because they think the country is failing or going down the tubes or the establishment has failed them.We saw it in 1980. We all remember. We saw it in 1984. We did see it in 2008. That was a movement election. I think you're beginning to see the real signs of this taking hold beyond just New Hampshire, beyond just South Carolina, but to interesting states like Nevada, perhaps even, even a state like Colorado, which has gone very purple in recent years. I think people are fed up with Washington...HANNITY: Real quick.INGRAHAM: ... corruption, and they want a change.HANNITY: Geraldo, can he win New York? You are the quintessential New Yorker.RIVERA: He might. It all turns -- you mentioned Colorado. Colorado is a swing state, like Nevada, like North Carolina, like Florida. It all depends. Trump has offended Mexicans and Muslims and millennials and some women. Will those offended people be energized to show up in the way that Trump supporters are energized to show up? It will be an energy. It will be -- and again, I...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Is he bringing more people than anyone dreamed?RIVERA: He will have people registering to vote who haven't voted in their entire adult lives, but he might have the opposite effect. Will the Puerto Ricans turn out in Florida, for example? Will the Mexicans turn out?HANNITY: Last question. If he's one of your top two, who's the other one?RIVERA: On the Republican side?HANNITY: In general. Who are your top two people?RIVERA: Well, I like Chris Christie also. I like him a lot as a person.  He didn't do anything to help me when I thinking of running for senate in New Jersey. But I give him a little slack. You know...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Did you win ""The Apprentice""?(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: Hey, Sean...RIVERA: I didn't win, but at least he kept me on board for six weeks!INGRAHAM: Hey, Sean...HANNITY: Last word.INGRAHAM: Sean -- Sean, one more thing. Didn't Bill Clinton look really tired and old?(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: He had a slight tremor. And it took him a while to get going, but...INGRAHAM: He and Trump and he-RIVERA: ... but I love the guy. Once he started, he was...INGRAHAM: ... are the same age, Geraldo.HANNITY: I -- I...INGRAHAM: Yes, look at how vigorous -- look at how vigorous Geraldo looks...(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: And we are the same age, and so is Donald Trump.HANNITY: Hey, I'll tell you, Trump got the better of that exchange with the Clintons.INGRAHAM: Big-time.HANNITY: And it shut them down big-time! All right, guys, good to see you all. Thank you.And coming up next tonight on this busy news night here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Their hunting rights, their shooting rights...CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: Moms Demand Action.CLINTON: ... their collecting rights. All of that is not going to be affected. So I'm going to keep beating the drum, and I'm delighted that the president announced the actions he did today.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, Hillary Clinton is apparently very happy about Obama clamping down on your 2nd Amendment rights. We'll check in with Bo Dietl, Sheriff David Clarke and Katie Pavlich. They are here with reaction.Then later, speaking of New Jersey governor Chris Christie, he is rising in the polls in New Hampshire. He's here to explain why.Also, North Korea claims it tested a hydrogen bomb! 2016 contender Carly Fiorina says this is yet another example of Hillary's failed foreign policy. That's coming up, along with Donald Trump, Jr, tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: There needs to be a rival organization to the NRA of responsible gun owners who know that their hunting rifles...CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: Moms Demand Action.CLINTON: ... their collecting rights. All of that is not going to be affected. So I'm going to keep beating the drum, and I'm delighted that the president announced the actions he did today.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, Hillary is delighted at the president's executive action on guns. Here with reaction, Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke, Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich and former NYPD detective Bo Dietl.Sheriff, let me start with you. It to me is a very simple equation. The number one best advocate for gun sales in America has become this president, and if Hillary wants to wrap her arms around illegal, unconstitutional executive actions on this, I think it hurts her in the campaign. Thoughts.SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY: Well, first of all, there is a rival group to the National Rifle Association. It's called the Democratic Party.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Yes!CLARKE: And as far as President Obama and Mrs. Bill Clinton, they are anti-gun bigots. They are utterly intolerant to anybody else's view when it comes to -- other than their own when it comes to the 2nd Amendment, the shooting sports and self-defense. But you watch. By next summer, she'll be photographed walking around in a field like she's hunting, participating in the shooting sports with a gun resting on her shoulder probably holing it upside-down.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Michael Dukakis in a tank!CLARKE: She doesn't know what she's doing with it anyway. Look, if you want to reduce violence -- and the president knows this -- you target criminals. You do not target otherwise law-abiding citizens. And you don't make them have to go jump through hoops in a higher threshold to exercise their 2nd Amendment rights.But Sean, if he goes after the real perpetrators of violence in America, he would have to target the underclass young black male who disproportionately is involved in all this violence, and he doesn't want to do that.HANNITY: Let me read from the AP, Katie Pavlich. They said that what the president announced would not have prevented the slaughters of 20 1st graders at Sandy Hook Elementary or 14 county workers at a holiday party in San Bernardino, and it would have had no impact in keeping weapons from the hands of suspects in several of the deadliest recent mass shootings that have occurred that have resulted and spurred these calls for more gun control.So they're really feel-good legislation. It's not going to do anything.KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's not going to do anything. And it really is disappointing because the president has an opportunity here to work with organizations like the NRA, who have actually done a lot of significant work when it comes to actually keeping guns out of the hands of criminals.You know, Hillary Clinton can attack the NRA all she wants, the fact is that the NRA has a higher approval rating than Hillary Clinton does when it comes to trustworthiness, that's for sure. And the bottom line is that the NRA really has done work with in the past of previous presidents in terms of getting mental health legislation on the books to make sure people who are mentally ill cannot get their hands on firearms.This is about grandstanding for Hillary Clinton. It's about grandstanding for Barack Obama. And it really is a shame. And the bottom line is if the president really wants to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, maybe his Justice Department should stop releasing felons, many of which are illegal immigrants, only to the streets of America.HANNITY: And you know...PAVLICH: They can start there.HANNITY: You know, the president cries here, Bo, and I remember the president -- remember that guy who got beheaded, James Foley?BO DIETL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.HANNITY: Yes. He gives a quick 30-second comment and races off. He didn't want to miss his tee time!DIETL: But I'm really glad about one thing. I'm glad the president watches your show. This is the first time that the president mentioned Chicago in any of his...HANNITY: True.DIETL: ... in any of his speeches...HANNITY: Second time.DIETL: ... about the kids dying in Chicago! Furthermore, on top of it, I do -- I mean, we're letting people out of jail on these drug things, these A-1 felonies and all that across the country. A lot of these drug dealers were involved with murders and guns. That's where the problem was. And if this president wanted to do an executive order, like I said on your show many times, get the FBI, the ATF together and let's get into our inner cities (INAUDIBLE) task force to take those illegal guns off the street, not honest gun owners like of the 2nd Amendment, people that want to protect themself, because I tell you right now, when the ISIS comes to this country, we have 300,000 weapons out -- 300 million weapons out there...HANNITY: Hey...DIETL: ... and we're going to protect ourselves...HANNITY: Listen...DIETL: ... and ISIS is not going to shoot me. I'm not going to put my head down, get on my knees and get my head chopped off! I'm going to have my .9-millimeter, and I'm going to...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: And I'm going to have my 40 and my AR. Sheriff Clarke, if you're in San Bernardino, and God forbid somebody's there -- if I'm in that room, I want a Sheriff Clarke there that's armed or a Bo Dietl that's armed or Katie Pavlich or Sean Hannity armed. And I don't understand why people don't understand that. That's simple to me. It's common sense.CLARKE: Sure, it is. Look, I want as many law-abiding citizens to arm themselves in this country as we can get so that I have the partner that I need to beat back this sort of violence. And in these mass shooting situations, you're right, the great equalizer is a law-abiding citizen in that situation with a firearm that can take action because when seconds count, the police are usually minutes away.HANNITY: Yes. All right, guys...DIETL: You know, there's so many officers, so many cops across this country are retired. They see a cop pull a car over, they pull over, they let them know, Hey, I'm retired from the job, and you're watching over that cop. And that's what we have. And we have other good law-abiding citizens that would stand up for the people of America!HANNITY: All right, guys. Thank you all for being with us.When we come back, Governor Chris Christie -- he's hitting the campaign trail hard in New Hampshire. His numbers are going up. He'll talk about it.Then later, Donald Trump's son, Don, Jr., talks about his father's campaign.Also, North Korea claims to have tested a hydrogen bomb. 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina also here tonight with reaction.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Hi. Welcome back to ""Hannity."" 2016 Republican presidential candidate Governor Chris Christie -- he's been campaigning hard in New Hampshire, and his efforts seem to be paying off because his poll numbers are rising now in the Granite State.Earlier, I spoke with the New Jersey governor about all this and more.  Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Governor, welcome back.GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Happy to be back, Sean. Thanks for having me.HANNITY: All right, you've been spending a lot of time in New Hampshire, but it appears to be paying off for you. You have one poll now you're in - - well, two polls you're in double digits. How important now is it for you to do well there? You've spent far less time in Iowa, but you have been spending time there. How important is New Hampshire to the campaign?CHRISTIE: It's important to everybody. And it's certainly important to us. I mean, you know, Iowa and New Hampshire are going to winnow this field, in my view, Sean, from 12 candidates down to 4 or 5. And so it's important for us to do well in Iowa and do very well here in New Hampshire.And I think from the reaction we're getting here, we feel momentum really moving in our direction. And I think people are listening to our message of securing the homeland first, keeping the American people safe and improving our economic situation. I think those things are being received well, and we're moving forward here.HANNITY: Let me ask you about the president's -- his position on guns and his executive action on guns. And you called the president a petulant child. Explain.CHRISTIE: Listen, this is a president who came into office, as you know, in 2008 with a big majority in the House and with a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Because of his policies and his conduct in office, seven years later, we have our largest majority in the House since 1928, and we have a majority in the Senate and we have 31 of the 60 governorships.Now, since the president's lost all of that, he now has decided he's just going to write laws on his own. He's going to give us edicts, as if he's a king. And that is a petulant child. He's refusing to listen to the will of the American people, which is they reject his policies.And so that's why I call him a petulant child. He's doing it on guns. He did it on immigration. He's done it on ""Obama care.""HANNITY: But did -- aren't the Republicans emboldening him? I mean, they said they would stop. They ran in 2014. Give us the Senate, we'll stop the president's proposal for executive actions on immigration. And they said they would defund the Department of Homeland Security, and then they caved in. Then they gave in.CHRISTIE: Yes, listen, the United States Congress has been weak. They've been weak and they've been vacillating, and they haven't done their job.And what we need in Washington now is a strong Republican president who knows how to govern. You know, Sean, in New Jersey over the last six years, I have made tough decisions and implemented them with the legislature of the opposite party. I've done more in New Jersey than they could ever think about doing in the United States Senate and in Washington, D.C.And so you're right, they have emboldened the president to an extent because they've been unwilling to be tough with him. When I get to the White House, there will be no hesitation from me to make the tough decisions that need to be made because I've been doing it for the last 13 years as a former federal prosecutor and now as the governor of New Jersey.HANNITY: Let me ask you about your positions in New Jersey. New Jersey has some of the toughest gun laws in the country. In '95, you ran on a platform of supporting the assault weapons ban. You said that GOP opponents that wanted to repeal it were dangerous, crazy and radical. And you supported in 2009 -- you ran against opposing attempts to permit concealed carry laws in New Jersey.Where do you -- where do you stand now? Because you appear to have changed.CHRISTIE: Well, listen, in 1995, Sean, I was 32 years old, and I've changed my mind. And the biggest reason that I changed my mind was my seven years as a federal prosecutor. What I learned in those seven years was that we were spending too much time talking about gun laws against law- abiding citizens and not nearly enough time talking about enforcing the gun laws strongly against criminals.And I saw the difference when I did that for seven years as a federal prosecutor. I learned the difference and I learned what the limitations are of these laws that people are talking about and how they much, much more greatly infringe on law-abiding citizens than they do anything to prevent crime.Having learned that, my position's changed. And quite frankly, if I had the choice now, I'd make New Jersey a state where you can have a shall (ph) issue on conceal and carry. Now our legislature won't do that, but I have done recently is to make sure that we're making it easier for folks to be able to get a permit in New Jersey because they deserve the right to do that as law-abiding citizens.HANNITY: You know, it's fascinating. I ask the question all the time of people that are on the anti-gun side. And I say, OK, if you're in a situation like the tragedy and the murderous rage in San Bernardino and you're in a room like that, would you want somebody that knew how to use a firearm and had one with them, or if somebody breaks into your house, what are you going to do if they are armed and you are not?And there's not a good answer. There's no good answer except you're a sitting duck for the most part if you're not armed. So you know, is that part of what you learned as being a prosecutor?CHRISTIE: Well, there's no question about that. And I also learned that you've got to get those people that you're talking about on the folks who are in the murderous rage in San Bernardino or the person who enters your home to try to rob you or to try to do harm to your family -- you have to get those people off the streets, too. And the fact is that we're not spending nearly enough time on this.And this is part of the president's problem. Where's he been when the crime rate and the murder rate in Chicago has gone up in 18 percent? Where has he been when the murder rate in New York is up 11 percent? Instead he and liberals like Bill de Blasio and Rahm Emanuel and others, what they're doing is not supporting the police departments, not making sure that they're being supported, and they're letting them do their jobs. And so we have criminals who have easy access to guns.And then in places like Chicago and New York -- and you know this because of your experience in New York -- it is incredibly difficult for a law abiding citizen to get a gun. Is that making New York or Chicago safer?  It seems to me that the evidence shows that it's not. And so what really changed me as a prosecutor, I got to learn the evidence and what's really going on out in the world of law enforcement. And that's why my position changed.SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Governor, congratulations on those poll numbers in New Hampshire. Thank you for being with us. We appreciate your time as always.CHRISTIE: Sean, thank you for having me on and happy new year to you.HANNITY: Thank you. Happy new year, governor.And coming up, the world remains on edge after North Korea claims to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina says this is an example of Hillary Clinton's foreign policy failures. She'll join us with more.But first, I sit down with Donald Trump and son Don Jr., and he explains why he thinks his dad is the best Republican candidate to become the next commander in chief, that and more on this busy news night tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has taken American politics by storm. Now I sat down with his son, Donald Jr., to find out why he thinks his father is the best candidate for president. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Don Jr., good to see you again. How are you, sir?DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION: Good to see, Sean. How are you?HANNITY: All right, so here you are, the son of this famous man, hardworking man, well known billionaire, makes a lot of news. Did any of this politics stuff surprise you?DONALD TRUMP JR.: No, not at all. I mean, I know when my father puts his mind to something he's going to do a phenomenal job with it. He's a great businessman. He has an incredible track record. And I know he understands what this country needs and what it wants. And I think he was sick of being on the sidelines watching a bunch of incompetents in his mind. And in our world, in our business world, these people wouldn't last five minutes in real companies, and he's sick of them making decisions that are costing our children, their children behind them, trillions of dollars and really giving up the great power that we've built up over the last 200 years. I mean, this country has had 200 years of hegemony over the rest of the world, and it feels like our politicians, they just want to give that back.HANNITY: It's very interesting. Even before your dad got into this race I would go over occasionally and interview your dad, and there you are, and there Eric, is and there Ivanka is. And you guys worked very, very closely with him on a daily basis. Is there any part of your dad that maybe you know that maybe the general public doesn't pick up watching his speeches or his interviews or reading his tweets?DONALD TRUMP JR.: Well, listen, I think a lot of people see, obviously, the business side of him. But, I mean, he's just a great guy. We enjoyed the holidays so much. To be able to spend time with him when he's not necessarily working or not doing the political thing, I mean, he's much more of a blue collar American. I say that in jest a little bit, but he's a blue collar guy with a balance sheet. That's the way he likes to have fun. He knows more about sports than any human being out there. He relaxes. The ribbing that we give each at the Christmas holidays is incredible. He's much more of an ordinary American and a proper American than a lot people would probably ever believe.HANNITY: He's been involved in a lot of controversy since he's got involved in this. I would argue that he's raised the bar of where political correctness is. I've used the term, Don, that he transcends conventional political gravity. At any point, do you say, you give him advice, at any point did you ever flinch and say, oh, dad, why did you tweet that? Why do you say that? Do you speak bluntly to him about what we think?DONALD TRUMP JR.: We do. We always speak very bluntly with him. But in the end I think the things that he's saying are things that need to be said. They're conversations that need to be had. There conversations that haven't been had. Everyone knows about it. If you go to a diner in the middle of America, people are having these conversations, but our politicians are too scared to bring it up because they're worried about offending the 0.002 percent of the country that may somehow be subject to what the conversation may be. And it's ridiculous. He's a straight- talking guy. He's always been. He has a history of that in business as a personality for the last 35 years. And that's what he's going to bring to the table. He's going to bring straight, honest conversation and bring up topics that, while they may be sensitive, they have to be said.HANNITY: You know, one of the things he brought up this week, we heard the president yesterday talking about guns and getting all emotional. Your father said if guns don't keep you safe, talking to Hillary Clinton in support of the president, disarm your bodyguards.It's interesting because every year in New York your dad, I am mentioned in the article, there are certain New Yorkers that have pistol carry permits, and he's a staunch believer in the Second Amendment. What do you think about the president's proposals, and, more importantly, what your dad's response to Hillary was, which I thought was pretty strong?DONALD TRUMP JR.: I think his response is 100 percent right. It's really easy for someone to say no one should have guns when they're guarded by people with MP-5s. It's a little bit different. I'm always mentioned in that article as well because I'm a staunch believer in the Second Amendment. I shoot virtually every weekend. I'm a big outdoorsman. I believe in all those traditions. And I believe it's important for people to be able to defend themselves.The impositions that this government is trying to put on now, it's the typical death by 1,000 cuts. We'll take a little bit here, we'll take a little bit here, we'll take a little bit here. And it doesn't end the conversations for 25, 50 years. It starts the conversation again the next day what they're looking to take back.And really it's about freedoms. If I want to hand one of my old shotguns that I've had for 50 years to my grandkid one day, I have to good through a federal transfer? It's crazy. The rules that have been imposed, the rules that are already on the books haven't been effective. If you look at the places where the strictest gun control measures, whether it be California, Los Angeles, Barack Obama's home state in Chicago, they're a disaster, and they have the greatest rules in the world. But his rules are only going to have an effect and an impact on people who are actually willing to play by the rules, which is exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to do. It makes no sense to me.HANNITY: Last question. All right,, so having been to Trump Towers many times, and I've gotten to know you and your brother and your sister, you work very closely with your dad. If your father becomes president, do all three of you go to Washington? Are you going to be in the Oval Office?  Have you discussed that?DONALD TRUMP JR.: You know, I think we've joked about it a little bit. I think he'd give me the Department of the Interior because of my love of the outdoors, so we can get that going.But again, I think the fact that he's running now as opposed to in 2012 where he didn't that he's had enough faith in myself and my siblings to be able to run the company. I mean, we've got tens of thousands of people that are under his direct employ. Those people, he wouldn't leave a company and leave those people and their lives and everything they've put into it at risk if he didn't think there was competent leadership to take over after him. So I think the fact that he's running now is the greatest to perhaps myself, and, again, Ivanka's and Eric's abilities to be able to run this company because he's not the kind of guy that would leave or jeopardize those people's families, their livelihoods to go do something where he wouldn't be in charge.HANNITY: Don Jr., great to see you again. Thanks for being with us.DONALD TRUMP JR.: Great to see you.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And coming up, the rogue regime in North Korea claims that it successfully carried out a hydrogen bomb test. 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina says this is yet another example of Hillary Clinton's failed foreign policies. She joins us next to explain that and more.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" The world is on edge after North Korea announced late last night that it successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb.  Now experts are skeptical, however, that the test involved the hydrogen bomb, and it could take several days for the intelligence community to evaluate North Korea's claim.Earlier today 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina tweeted that the situation with North Korea is yet another example of Hillary Clinton's failed foreign policies, and she joins us now with more.Welcome back, Carly. How are you? I almost called you Hillary. That was a huge mistake.CARLY FIORINA, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How are you, Sean? I saw that.  I heard that.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: I might as well start cursing. I mean, that's worse than cursing at somebody.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: You know, when she was herself, when she was going for a confirmation hearing, she actually made the statement that she would embark on a very aggressive effort to end North Korea's nuclear program. So I guess this is an example that that really failed.FIORINA: Well, yes, that's right. But here's the other thing, Sean. When you don't respond to bad behavior, you get more of it. So not only has she gotten every foreign policy challenge wrong as the secretary of state, she has failed to respond. When our embassy is attacked in Benghazi by terrorists and there is no response, you get more bad behavior. When Russia invades Ukraine and there is no response, you get more bad behavior.  When Syria crosses the red line and there is no response, you get more bad behavior. When Iran launches tests of ballistic missiles and there is no response, you get more bad behavior. When North Korea attacks Sony Pictures and there is no response, you get more bad behavior. In other words, Mrs. Clinton, you cannot lead from behind. We must respond when we are attacked or provoked.HANNITY: I want to know -- I don't know if you saw this fatwa that was released by Reuters that actually goes into detail how to be a good rapist by ISIS terrorists if they have female prisoners, and they lay out the rules for this. And I'm thinking, what are we doing about this? What are we going to do to stop this? Where is the plan to win this battle, this conflict of civilization? Because we know that this is a worldwide caliphate that they're advancing. But nobody seems to want to talk about it.FIORINA: That's right.HANNITY: Hillary doesn't, Obama doesn't.FIORINA: Well, they don't. And, by the way, we have some candidates on our side who don't have a plan, either. But here's my plan, and I've been very explicit about it. I've laid out a plan for how we keep people safe here at home, and I've laid out a plan of how we wage war and win by denying ISIS territory overseas. We must deny them their territory, to your point, Sean, because the territory that they've conquered because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama declared victory in Iraq and against every generals advice withdrew all of our troops, leaving a vacuum, weaponry, territory for ISIS to conquer, that territory, their caliphate, is that from which they draw legitimacy, potency, credibility. We have to deny them that territory.And that's why it's so important to stand with our allies in that region.  And that is why when Iran continues to get away with bad behavior, what do our allies who are Iran's enemies think about us? It is why we cannot stand by while Russia allies itself with Iran. You can't outsource American leadership to Russia. Russia isn't on our side. They're on their side and Iran's side.HANNITY: You have been one of the strongest voices in terms of criticism against Hillary. And I wanted to ask you, because I think it's part of the Democratic playbook, poor Mitt Romney was accused of being engaged on a war on women because he wanted to hire them and he had their resumes in binders. But now that Hillary is trying to play the victim a little bit and the gender card, do you think it is fair game to bring up the issues involving not allegations of consensual sex but assault that have been made against her husband? Is that fair game?FIORINA: Well, sure it's fair game. Look, everything Bill Clinton has done is fair game. He's a former president. I just don't think that is the most effective way to beat Hillary Clinton, because while all that was going on there were a lot of women who felt for whatever reason great sympathy for Hillary Clinton. Look, if my husband were doing that, I would have left him. I would not have behaved the way Hillary Clinton did.HANNITY: Do you think she's an enabler? Do you think she assisted in the besmirching and the smearing and the slandering?FIORINA: Well, sure she did. Of course she did. Of course she did. But the most effective way to beat Hillary Clinton is to remind voters of Hillary Clinton's behavior.HANNITY: We have two important debates coming up. Where do you see your place in this heading into Iowa in 26 days? Where do you see yourself here, and how do you make the recovery? What is your strategy?FIORINA: Well, I don't think I need to make recovery. I think I need to make progress. Remember, Sean, I started 17 out of 16. The pollsters didn't even ask my name because less than three percent of voters had ever heard from me. Now I am tied essentially with two governors who are household names in politics, who spent millions of dollars each on television. I haven't spent -- my campaign hasn't spent any money on TV.And I know what I have seen on the ground. I've seen loads of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. We moved to bigger venues. I have packed town halls. And the truth is that most people in Iowa and New Hampshire make up their minds in the last two weeks. So this race is wide open. And I have come further faster than anyone predicted because voters listen and they like what they hear. And when I tell them it's time, citizens, to take our country back and a professional politician isn't going to be able to do it, and a guy who is a celebrity but has no plan isn't going to do it, either, they're listening.HANNITY: Carly Fiorina, looking forward, 26 days, its' coming. Thanks for being with us.  FIORINA: Thanks, Sean.HANNITY: When we come back, our ""Ask Sean"" segment is next. And we need your help. An important ""Question of the Day"" is straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Time for our ""Question of the Day."" So what do you think about the president trampling on your Second Amendment rights? We want to hear what you have to say. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, on Twitter @SeanHannity, let us know what you think.Now, you've been sending questions all day. It's time for our ""Ask Sean"" segment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey, Hannity. Calina (ph) here. My question is, why does it seem like Obama pens never runs out of ink when it comes to executive orders and he's always bypassing Congress? Does he have no respect for our constitution?(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, Calina (ph), that is a great question, and I appreciate you sending it in. Here is the bottom line -- Congress is allowing this to happen. We have coequal branches of government, the executive branch, the legislative branch, the judicial branch. They all have their own enumerated powers. This president bypasses Congress.  Congress should not let him get away with it. They have the power of the purse. The can defund all of those efforts, and I would like to see them finally use that power. Great question.That is all the time we have left this evening. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, the biggest event to date in campaign 2016 is now just 24 hours away and at the center of the political universe is the battle ground state of Ohio.Welcome to ""The Kelly File"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly reporting live from Cleveland. By this time tomorrow night the top ten republican presidential contenders will be going head to head for the first time in a debate right here. And before this arena is filled, before the candidate takes the stage, before the first question is even asked and I assure you it has already been drafted, we are hearing that this debate will have an impact on the White House race like few before it ever have and the reason in two words, Donald Trump.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: Joining me now, Bill Burton, he's the former White House deputy press secretary under President Obama, Howard Kurtz, the host of Fox News' ""MediaBuzz"" and our Chris Stirewalt who is our Fox News digital politics editor. Thank you so much all of you for being here, live with us.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.KELLY: So, Stirewalt knows that the debate questions have been formulated. And they are -- it's not time for that. Tomorrow. Okay, tomorrow.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Starting now.KELLY: Let me start with you, Chris.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Uh-mm.KELLY: Donald Trump, everybody says it is a Donald Trump debate. I don't know.STIREWALT: Look, he obviously has some decisions to make about what message he wants to be. Presidential, et cetera. I think too much is put into this because of two things. What drives this debate are these questions. And the questions that you and Bret and Chris are asking is going to be what drives this debate. And these are tough questions. These are Tasmanian devil questions.KELLY: Oh, what?STIREWALT: These are tough.(LAUGHTER)You know, he spun around and stuff but it was hard.(LAUGHTER)So, the point is, these questions are what the candidates should be worried about. They shouldn't be worried about, not this one liner with Donald Trump. They should be worried about answering these questions. The other thing that they ought to be careful about is, frankly, there are some guys who are tough debaters up there. Ted Cruz is up there. Mike Huckabee is up there. There are some guys who are really good. They are thinking only about Trump. They are going to get their clock clean by somebody else.KELLY: Well, you know what else people don't think about is, we as the debate moderators and the debate team, we are charge with trying to keep equal time among these candidates and we've made up a promise to try to do that. So, if it is spinning out of control and if one candidate like Trump or whoever is getting tons of time, we're going to have to cut that off and move on to other candidates if somebody keeping the master time list. So, it just -- it won't happen that Trump has got 30 minutes and somebody else has got ten.STIREWALT: Good luck cutting Trump off. But --KELLY: You know I can do it.(LAUGHTER)You know I can do it. Howie, let me ask you because you have been hearing a different kind of messaging from Donald.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": Here is the news flash, Donald Trump is toning it down. He hasn't said anything inflammatory, or taken a whack at anybody's head in a week. He is such a dominant frontrunner right now Megyn that he realizes that he doesn't need to be Don Rickles candidate, hurling out insults. Everybody is tuning in to this arena tomorrow night, they want to see if he is a wild man the way -- or does he seem reasonable.KELLY: He is actually dialing it back. Not just with respect to his criticism of the other candidates. But media people too. He hated Chuck Todd. He said Charles Krauthammer was a clown and a moron. And now that's all be reversed.KURTZ: All those idiots and losers.KELLY: We remember what was said, it's like a couple of weeks ago.KURTZ: I know but this is the sign of a guy moving from outside agitator to maybe being a plausible nominee. There is no point anymore.  He may punch back from people he who thinks unfairly criticize him but there's no point anymore in ridiculing individual journalists. After all (INAUDIBLE) treat with a little bit of respect.KELLY: Well, and it seems like the guys on the debate stage, he's telegraphing to them, I won't cut you if you don't cut me. Like, I will cut you if you cut me first. Bill, let me ask you. As a person who actually works with the man who is now our president, you were there, you were with him while they were getting him ready. You guys were all getting ready for a night like tomorrow night. What do you think is going on behind the scenes in these camps and how high do you think they view the stakes?BILL BURTON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think that this debate is actually one of the most important primary debates that we have ever seen. People haven't anticipated a debate like this ever. Probably even when you look back to '07 and '08 when President Obama was running, you know, there would be moments that happened along the way, Reverend Wright, thinks like that where people would want to see how do the candidates respond in the debate setting but nothing like this where Donald Trump is coming and changing the whole thing. So, right now you have a bunch of aides who are scared out of their minds that their candidate is going to do something that's going to cause massive problems for them. But nobody is out there thinking, oh, I can't wait until tomorrow because my guy is going to clean their clock.KELLY: How do they watch it? How do you think the support teams watch the debate? Do they go to a private room? Do they sit there nail biting? What?BURTON: Well, people sit and they watch it and, you know, it is a little different now because Twitter is so much more important than it was even back in 2007. So, they are sitting there and they are also engaging.  They have their whole media teams. But I just want to go back to something that Chris said. You know, I actually don't think they are worried about the questions that much because they are going to say what they're going to say. And then the interaction --(CROSSTALK)The good questions are not the ones that are scripted. It's the ones that happens in the exchange.STIREWALT: You never had to do a Fox News debate. No, I'm serious.  So the point here isn't to do -- if I may -- the point here is that these questions are designed to not let them off the hook. There has to be an affirmative thing that you have to say --  (CROSSTALK)STIREWALT: You have to answer something in these questions. These are -- they are designed to say I know what you said about this but what about that?KELLY: The dodge and lead will be readily apparent, all the viewers at home, if they choose to go that route and they may very well chose to go that route. But, you know, the question is whether this is actually not to be too grandiose about it because Fox News is hosting it, and I'm a co- moderator but is this actually, because they have the potential to change the course of history? I mean, one of these guys could be out by 11:00 tomorrow night?KURTZ: I don't think it will change the course of civilization, perhaps.KELLY: Okay. Yes.STIREWALT: Okay. The Republicans decided they want to wait to start their nominating process because they thought it was too long, it beat up Mitt Romney, he got into the general election and then loss. So, they waited. You know what they did. They freighted and freighted and freighted tomorrow night. They freighted and freighted this debate because now, there is no Iowa straw poll. This is the first debate. The stage is crowded. The stakes are high. They are worried about Trump. Hillary Clinton showing no vulnerability. It is all swirling, they're coming here.  And yes, it's a pretty big deal.KELLY: Go ahead, Howie.KURTZ: The reason I talk about moments in this debate is that you will have the huge audience for the FOX debate tomorrow night but then you have the media echo chamber. And ten candidates are not going to get sound bites that replay in segment after segment and newscast after newscast.  There isn't no rumor in such a crowded field. So there will be Trump undoubtedly. And maybe Jeb and Marco or somebody else. And that is what these other candidates are hoping for some kind of moment where it doesn't have to be a zinger but it has to be something memorable.BURTON: I think that's right. I think that right after the debate, it will be very hard to tell who actually won it. I think you will find out in the days that follow. If you think back to the South Carolina debate in 2007 where President Obama said he would speak with Ahmadinejad if he thought that that can be a progress. In the moment, it was this onslaught of media and people saying, oh, this is a huge gap, he really screwed up. And I was on a conference call with the President the next day, then senator. And he was like I'm not backing down from that, that's what's I really think. If that is what we need to do. And we fought that fight and we won the public opinion battle on that.KELLY: Yes, wait, I remember that. Charles Krauthammer -- I remember that.(LAUGHTER)STIREWALT: Foot note.KELLY: You know, the thing if you ask me and I could be wrong. But I feel like the frontrunners other than Trump because he is going to be himself, I think.STIREWALT: Right.KELLY: You know, he said he is not really preparing, he's just going to go out there and be himself. I don't know. I mean, some of their articles today says sort of the post policy debate for Trump. He said, he's not setting up on policies. He is not going to go out there and say, I am who I am and I am ticked off like the rest of you and here is why.  But you take it Jeb Bush, you take it Scott Walker, one of these guys who are along the top who really thinks that they could get it if Trump collapses.STIREWALT: Right.KELLY: They have a lot to lose. Jeb Bush did not get good reviews from his performance in New Hampshire on Monday night. And I think the expectations for somebody like Jeb Bush is pretty high. Right? He's a Bush. He's a two time governor. He should be smooth. He should come out here and be able to rock it. And if he doesn't, you know, could this be a campaign employee?STIREWALT: One of the things that I love most about Americans is that they don't spend as much time thinking about politics as we do. They live their normal lives. They do decent things instead of sit around and think about what politicians say all the time. These debates are moments when decent ordinary people tune in and they say, I guess I have a civic duty, I have to pay attention to what these chuckle heads in politics are doing.  So, they tuned in. And then its flashcards, Jeb Bush, okay, flash card, yes or no? Scott Walker. Flash card. Do I like this guy? Do I not like this guy? The comfort level.KELLY: But in a moment that your impression could be formed or collapsed, I mean, a stutter, one wrong word, a look of uncertainty, a dodge when you are asked a direct question.KURTZ: Oops. But there is such a thing -- there is such a thing as expectation. So, people who don't follow politics intently will still have a certain expectation of a Jeb Bush, or Scott Walker, or sitting governor as Donald Trump, you know, they have heard so much about it. So, he has a pretty low bar to clear frankly.   KELLY: Yes.KURTZ: And the others, they may not know --KELLY: I have to go but I can't go without asking you Bill, as a Democrat, is there anybody who's coming on the stage tomorrow night who you are a little worried about?BURTON: I would say because Donald Trump is in the race, he's kept people from rising up, people like John Kasich who is not really given a fair shot in the media. And I think if you look at somebody like that who is a popular governor in this state, whose economy is doing pretty well, he hasn't been given a lot of oxygen. I think tonight in his hometown arena, it could be pretty interesting.KELLY: So, you like having Trump in this debate?(LAUGHTER)BURTON: I do. Very much.KELLY: We like it, too. Great to see you all. Thank you so much.BURTON: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: To be continued tomorrow night. Well, our political coverage continues next with Florida Senator Marco Rubio on what the political press is now saying about him. Plus, how he is preparing for tomorrow night.And then, dramatic new revelations in the Hillary Clinton e-mail and server scandal. See what the FBI is now doing and whether Mrs. Clinton was caught telling a whopper to reporters this investigating this story. We'll play you the tape.Plus, even after some strong attacks on Republicans in the past, President Obama managed to say something today that stunned even his critics. Charles Krauthammer joins us on that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Just because Iranian hardliners chant ""Death to America,"" does not mean that's what all Iranians believe.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This election cannot be like the other ones. But we do not live in ordinary times. The world is changing and so must our policies.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was Florida Senator Marco Rubio just hours ago in Cleveland in town for tomorrow night's big GOP debate. Following his campaign launch in April, Senator Rubio received high marks for his commending speech, and saw strong poll numbers in the weeks to follow. In recent weeks however, those numbers have dipped some leaving some political media outlets asking if this senator has a problem on his hands.Joining me here tonight, Florida Senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio. This is what I love Senator Rubio. This is what they -- they are wondering whether -- I love this, this is America today. They're wondering whether your message of optimism and hope is just not connecting with the voters. They are saying you need to connect more with people's anger.RUBIO: Well, obviously there are things that wrong in this country.  We have to acknowledge it. But this is a great country. It can be greater. And that is what the campaign is about. We need a country that fulfills its potential and we are not. And so my message has been that from the beginning, it's been that way for 10 or 12 years. I believe it's the greatest country in the world. I wouldn't trade places with any other country.  KELLY: Do you think that's what happened -- I don't want to make this about Trump. But do you think that is what is happening with Trump, that he is doing that because, you know -- I'm not going to take it anymore?RUBIO: Like I said, I'm not a pundit. I'm a candidate. I'm running for office. All I can do is tell people my message, who I am, what I would do if elected and then people get to decide. And I think they are ready to decide. Half the country is on vacation literally. And so, this is just the ups and down.KELLY: Does the half support you because --RUBIO: Maybe, good question, Megyn. Now, you know these polls go up and down. I've been higher than those numbers. I've been lower than those numbers. I am not worried about a poll right now. I am more concerned about whether we are being consistent in our message communicating it to people. I want people to understand not just who I am but why I'm running.  And that to me is what is important at this stage.KELLY: Talk about the money. Because one of the things they say, you know, may be problematic for you is you've raised a total of about 45 million so far. Jeb Bush is raised a total of 114 million. And that is important in politics.RUBIO: Yes. It is. The question is not how much you raise, the question is, do you raise enough to be able to communicate your message?  And we are confident that we will. Now, we are not going to be the leading fundraiser in this race. And we understood that going in.KELLY: Trump is on TV every day, every night.RUBIO: Well, again, these campaigns like I said, I mean, these are long journeys. There are going to be ups and downs along the way.  Tomorrow night is a big night. A lot of people for the first time are going to start to tune in to this campaign seriously. But after tomorrow night, there's going to be other debates and other twists and turns in the road. So, I'm not worried about one day, one week or one month. It's really about the long term.KELLY: How are you preparing now? What do you do?RUBIO: You know, the truth is that when you have been both, you know, involved in the issues of the day debating those and also out there on the stamp, you've been answering these questions for a while --KELLY: You're going to hey, you haven't been answering these questions.RUBIO: Well, maybe. No, the topics I think the topic you have been talking about for a while. And I think that the real advantage is that you know what you believe and you've talked about it in the past, it is a lot easier to communicate.KELLY: Are you going to dodge and weave? I mean, do you think you'll really answer the question --RUBIO: I hope not. No, I mean, I like to answer questions. I think people deserve it. We are choosing the president of the United States.  This is not a county commissioners. It is the most important political job in the world and it deserves the scrutiny and the attention that it is going to get. Not just tomorrow night but in the weeks and months to come.KELLY: Are there any nerves -- you are only human.RUBIO: Yes. Sure. I have never done this before. I have never run for president. This is a big stage. I wouldn't call it nerves. I certainly think there is an excitement about being part of something like this.KELLY: We have nerves as moderators. Bret, Chris and I talked about how -- and we have the questions written down. We know what they are. You have the hard job.RUBIO: Well, I wouldn't say nerves in terms of fear but certainly nerves in terms of understanding, this is a pretty big deal that you get to be a part of this, that you get to talk to the country about its future.  You know, very few Americans ever get a chance to do what the ten of us and the others that are on the stage tomorrow are going to do. That's a pretty exciting opportunity.KELLY: So, you want to deliver your message. So, I get that. But, you know, what is the one thing you want people to take away about Marco Rubio?RUBIO: Well, I have a debt to this country I will never repay. I mean, this is not just the nation I was born. And it literally changed the history of my family. And the reason why I am in public service, the reason why I am running for president is I want this to continue to be a country where people can do for their children what my parents did for me.  The purpose of my parent's life was to give me a chance to do all the things they never could. That makes us different from the rest of the world. And the reason I am running for president is I want this to continue to be that kind of country.KELLY: That's nice. I hope I didn't steal your closing statement for tomorrow.RUBIO: Well, I have said it so many times before that --  KELLY: All right. Let me hear it again tomorrow night at about 11:00. Great to see you.RUBIO: Thank you.KELLY: See you tomorrow.RUBIO: See you tomorrow.KELLY: All the best.Well again, the Fox News GOP primary debate begins at 9:00 Eastern Time tomorrow. Yours truly will be moderating along with Bret Baier and Chris Wallace. And then ""The Kelly File"" is immediately after the debate with Brit Hume, Charles Krauthammer. Frank Luntz will be here with some real time feedback on the candidate's performances with the focus group of GOP voters. Don't miss that. That will be really great.Plus, new polls show that immigration remains a top concern for voters ahead of tomorrow night's debate.And tonight Ann Coulter and journalist Jose Antonio Vargas will tell us what they think the voters should be listening for.Plus, new controversy for Hillary Clinton tonight as a bombshell report raises new questions about whether or not she has been truthful about her e-mail server, the messages she sent and the story she is on camera telling in the weeks after the story broke. Don't go away.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am confident that I never sent nor received any information of classified at the time it was sent and received.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Breaking tonight new revelations from the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail scandal as major new questions arise about her private server and an alleged whopper she appears to have told about classified information. Let's start with the server. In March of this year, Mrs. Clinton claimed there was no issue in maintaining government e- mails on a private e-mail server in her home in Chappaqua in New York as this server she said was set up for former President Bill Clinton under the watch of the secret service. You know, there are big advantages to living with the former commander-in-chief. Listen. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: The system we use was set up for President Clinton's office and it had numerous safeguards. It was on property guarded by the Secret Service and there were no security breaches. So, I think that the use of that server was started with my husband certainly proved to be effective and secure.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: But now it turns out her e-mails, that is our e-mails were not maintained by the State Department or on Bill Clinton's server as she claims but were on an entirely different server. One established for her 2008 campaign which was not disclosed and it was reportedly set up and handled by staffers with limited training and handed off to an outside company. On top of that Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly maintained that there is nothing to this e-mail scandal because she never dealt with classified information there, period end of report. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone on my e- mail. There is no classified material. So, I certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: There is no classified material. Well, then the news broke that two inspectors generals for the intelligence community in state believed she did improperly maintain classified information. And what did she do in response to that allegation? She doubled down.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I am confident that I never sent nor received any sent information that was classified at the time it was sent and received.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: I never sent classified information. And then a federal judge issued an order demanding that Mrs. Clinton tell her e-mail story under oath and guess what just happened. Late last night Mrs. Clinton's team changed its story. Now it's no longer there was no classified information.  Now it's Mrs. Clinton had no documents that were, quote, ""marked classified at the time.""Joining me now Robert Zimmerman, a Democratic National Committee member from New York. Clinton donor and co-founder of Zimmerman/Edelson on public relations. Robert, good to see you.Robert Zimmerman: Good to be with you, Megyn.KELLY: I mean, come on.ZIMMERMAN: Oh, Megyn, I have a bigger blockbuster for you. Megyn, I have a bigger blockbuster for you. The Washington Post Chris Cillizza reported today exclusive in the Washington Post, there is no investigation.  There are no allegations of wrong doing and Hillary Clinton is not the subject of a probe because everything that she said then checks out now.  And that's the real story here.KELLY: Bob, how does that explain the many stories I just took the audience through?ZIMMERMAN: Because they're all consistent. In fact, the inspector generals are the one, according to Ed Henry reporting on ""The Kelly File,"" the inspector general said, there were no classified markings on the e- mails that she sent or received. It may have happened after the fact but that doesn't change the truth that she wasn't sending or receiving e-mails.KELLY: Okay. But no one --ZIMMERMAN: As far as the server --KELLY: But they are investigating to see whether classified information was in her possession and is on the server. And she has been telling us all along there is no classified information until she just changed it to --  ZIMMERMAN: That's right.KELLY: Well, nothing has mark classified --  ZIMMERMAN: No, that's the point, though. How would she possibly know those are classified if it wasn't mark that way? That is why the inspector generals made the point that there was no information that was marked classified on her server.KELLY: Somehow the inspector generals figured it out, how did they figured it out?ZIMMERMAN: Well, they investigated it. And Megyn, also when it comes to the server the server was in the President's home.KELLY: Right. The problem is, see, you can avoid all of this if you just do your e-mailing on the State.gov server. But she didn't do it.  Now, with respect to the server, Robert, she told us that this is going to be secured. In the Chappaqua, not to worry, I'm married to the former president --ZIMMERMAN: Right.KELLY: It all set, the Secret Service is there. As it turns out, it was some dude named Justin Cooper who set up the server --ZIMMERMAN: Who worked for the President, who worked for the President --KELLY: Okay. No, he is not exactly -- he is not exactly a security expert but he did helped research two President Clinton's book.ZIMMERMAN: But Megyn you're forgetting the point that it was taken over --(CROSSTALK)Megyn, in just April of 2009 a specialist for the State Department, an intelligence IT, took over the server and managed it. So it was secure and safe and there were no breaches. Now, Megyn, I have a question for you. I assume you are going to ask Jeb Bush the same questions because as governor of Florida, he used a personal server to discuss net security issue like nuclear power plants or troop deployment, and he took this server home with him and selectively released government e-mails.KELLY: Okay. You know what that sounds like to me? Look over here, look at this shiny and pretty over here. I mean, I am talking to you about Hillary.ZIMMERMAN: I am trying to help you Megyn with tomorrow night.KELLY: Why does the story keep changing -- well, thank you. I do appreciate that. I know you have my best interest at heart.ZIMMERMAN: Thank you.KELLY: I mean it. Sincerely. But why does the story keep changing?  If you tell the truth from the beginning you don't have to worry about keeping your story.ZIMMERMAN: Megyn, the fact of the matter shows that Hillary Clinton was accurate, consistent and correct. So, ultimately the real tragedy for Republicans is they have no story here, they're going to have to talk about issues. I know you will make them do that tomorrow night.KELLY: I guess you're right about that. Robert, so great to see you.ZIMMERMAN: I will be cheering you on tomorrow.KELLY: Thank you, sir. All the best.Well, the pressure is on with less than 24 hours to go until tomorrow night's big debate in Cleveland. We will be into it. In fact, I think we are going to be taking our first break right around here at this time tomorrow night. So, it will be a full half an hour into the debate.And former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino is here with her advice to the candidates and the lessons they can learn from some of the historic stumbles and successes we have seen in debates of yesteryear.Plus, why did President Obama today compare Republicans to the terror supporting hardliners within the Iranian regime? Remember the promises of hope and change? Charles Krauthammer is next with an answer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Just because Iranian hardliners chant ""Death to America,"" does not mean that's what all Iranians believe.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will say this, that the reason I think I'm better as the nominee, is that I can bring this country together I think in a unique way across divisions of race, religion, region and that is what is going to be required in order for us to actually deliver on the issues.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Well, that was back in 2008 when then Senator, Barack Obama stood on the stage vying for the Presidency, promising he would be a different kind of leader, one who would bring the country together. But after more than six years of what both sides describe as a toxic political climate, it's clear it has not happened.  Despite that, the President still drew a stunned reaction from Conservatives today when he compared Republicans raising questions about his Iran deal to the terror-supporting hard liners within the Iranian regime. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just because Iranian hard liners chant death to America does not mean that is what all Iranians believe. In fact, it's those -- it's those hard liners who are most comfortable with the status quo. It's those hard liners chanting death to America who have been most opposed to the deal. They are making common cause with the Republican caucus.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Charles Krauthammer is a Fox News Contributor and Author of Things that Matter, now out in paperback with an added chapter on the age of Obama. Charles, good to see you, how about that?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well I mean, it's vintage Obama, the demonization of his opponent, the lumping them together with people chanting death to America -- I must say is a new low for the President, which is saying a lot considering how he does demonize the opposition, and question their motives. But what is even worse here is how delusional he is. He is pretending that those who chant death to America are some kind of KKK fringe in Iran. The people leading the chant of the revolutionary guards, the army, the parliamentary leaders, and of course as he always calls them, Obama always does, the supreme leader himself in a speech he made just a few days after the signing of the agreement. The chants break out death to America, death to Israel, and the ayatollah said may Allah hear your prayers. This idea that somehow he has been strengthening the moderate is simply absurd. What he is doing is he's made common cause with the hard liners, meaning the government, by removing the sanctions, by giving them a clear path to a bomb, an arsenal of bombs in ten years, and not just a path, but in ten years they will have an arsenal that will be legitimated and considered perfectly ok by the international community. He is the one who is going to be giving tens of billions of dollars to the hard liners, meaning the government and the ayatollah, which will be used for terror activities for expanding its influence and suppressing its people. And one more point -- when the moderates were out in the streets, the students demonstrating against the regime in 2009, specifically the people he says that the Conservatives, the Republicans are abandoning, Obama sided with the ayatollah. Shooting people in the streets, there was graffiti on the walls in Tehran that said Obama, Obama, are you with us or against us? Those were the demonstrators, those were the ones who don't shout death to America, looked to Obama and they got nothing.KELLY: You know the question is whether the administration is sort of in a suspension of disbelief. Because you have got President Obama talking about how this death to America stuff is just rhetoric from people who seem to be separated from the leaders. At the same time John Kerry says to Jonah Goldberg in a fascinating interview, he asked him whether he believes that Iran wants to wipe Israel off the map, and Kerry says I don't know the answer to that. He says they didn't make the bomb when they had enough material for 10 to 12. He doesn't know whether Iran wants to wipe Israel off the map, Charles. We just pulled a couple of quotes from the ayatollah in the not too distant past. The regime is a cancerous tumor. It will be removed. This barbaric wolf-like and infanticidal regime of Israel which bares no crime has no cure, but to be annihilated on and on and on about how -- oh here is one. It has to be erased from the map. So I mean it is pretty on point.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, then you have to ask yourself what really is going through Kerry's head. After all, the man who negotiated with pres -- the so-called moderate foreign minister said exactly the same thing to an interviewer during the negotiations. It isn't as if these are extremist wild statements. Look, it is a fundamental principle of the Islamic regime founded in 1979 to the expulsion of the influence of the United States, the domination of U.S. allies, meaning the gulf Arabs and other Arabs in the region. And the most important ideologically is the eradication of Israel as a way to redeem the Islamic idea that lands that were once controlled by Islam have to remain under Islam and particularly Israel because it is in the middle of the Middle East, and because it includes Jerusalem. This is a fundamental principle of theirs, and that Kerry and Obama seem to dismiss is really shocking. And you wonder how can you negotiate if you have no conception of the real ideology and intentions of your enemy.KELLY: Charles, great to see you. See you tomorrow night.KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure, yes.KELLY: Well, at this time tomorrow the American people will be treated to a debate already being described as nothing short of historic.  We'll see. We hope. And you can bet that immigration will be a hot topic right here in this arena that you're looking at right now.Up next, Best Selling Author Ann Coulter, and Journalist Jose Antonio Vargas, next on what they think the voters should be listening for.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new polls ahead of tomorrow night's first Republican Presidential Debate show a significant number of voters are very focused on what these candidates are going to say about one issue, immigration. In a moment we will be joined by Pulitzer Prize-winning Journalist, Jose Antonio Vargas who came out as an illegal immigrant himself. But first, we begin with Ann Coulter, an Attorney and Author of Adios America, the left's plan to turn our country into a third world hell hole. Always fun to see you. So this is big for you. This issue was obviously going to get attention at any presidential debate, but then we saw Kate Steinle murdered and we saw Donald Trump come under fire for his comments about immigration. What specifically are you going to be looking for tomorrow night?ANN COULTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Well, I think people should be looking for every other candidate on stage thanking Donald Trump, because otherwise it would have been me and a few other political obsessive watching. Now you're going to have ratings like -- if not the Super Bowl, at least the World Series I'd think because Donald Trump is there. But one of the main things we look for is this nonsense about -- oh yes, of course, we want to secure the border, but not a wall. Look, if they won't put a wall on the border they are not serious about it. Chris Christie saying yes, we want to secure the border, but I have seen the human spirit. A wall won't work. You have Jeb Bush saying it is an act of love. You have various others saying no, no, no, we are going to have drones and high technology, drones and high technology on the border is a synonym for no wall. What is a drone going to do? So we can watch them run across the border? That's great. Our country's being ruined but at least we will be entertained.KELLY: What about -- because the supporters on the other side look at the polls like this one from CBS News, and they say the American people are behind doing something to allow people to stay. Look at this, Republican voters believe immigrants in the U.S. illegally should be allowed to stay, 55 percent. Does that mean the Republicans are against you on this?COULTER: I don't think so. I think it's the way questions are asked.  That is very personal. You don't want to feel like you are being mean to the people who are here. A lot of them are admirable, a lot of them are good people. That shouldn't be the question for someone running to be the President of the United States. The question should be does this help America? And I like to ask them how many immigrants are enough? We already have 42 million immigrants in this country. These guys all talk about how they want to go back to the era of Reagan and they'd be Reagan.  Well, in the '80s when Reagan was elected, 1 of every 16 people residing in America was foreign born. Today is it one in seven. At what point -- we have 42 million now, 100 million, 200 million? How many are enough?KELLY: For the 11 or 12 million who are here now it is impractical, if not impossible to talk about deporting them.COULTER: Well, I like Romney's answer to that. Of course you verify and they'll go home the same way they came. Everyone made fun of Mitt Romney for saying they'd self-support, and it's so impractical -- there aren't 12 million, they're at least 30 million. Ok, so let's say 30 million, how are 30 million going to self deport? Are you going to round them up, we won't round them up to get them here, they're going to go home the same way they came.KELLY: Ann, thank you.COULTER: Thank you.KELLY: She's always entertaining.Roughly three years ago, Time Magazine ran a cover story about the then-12 million people living in America illegally. It was written by Jose Antonio Vargas, the man you see in the center of that picture, and he is now the Editor of emergingus.com, and Founder of DefineAmerica.com. He joins us tonight. Jose, good to see you again, and in that article...JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS, IMMIGRATION ACTIVIST: Thank you, Megyn for having me.KELLY: We're here and you wrote we are Americans. We are here just - - and we're here just not legally. And here you are still with no change in status.VARGAS: I actually agree with what Ann Coulter just said. Which is that what do you want to do with us? Does America really want to deport -- I mean you know I mean again, Ann is trying to ask a really hard question that no presidential candidate in the Republican field has really answered with specifics. What do you want to do with us? Unfortunately, Rick Perry is not going to be at that big debate, but let's say in Texas for example, 1.7 million undocumented people in Texas. Half of the construction workers in the state of Texas are undocumented. What would Texas do without undocumented construction workers? What would California do without undocumented migrants and farmers and workers that do these jobs? So again, what do you want to do with us? And by the way you're in Ohio.  You're in Ohio, there are about 12 million people in Ohio. That exact same number of undocumented immigrants in this country. Do you want to deport all of Ohio?KELLY: What do you think -- what do you make of the fact as an undocumented immigrant yourself about the fact that Donald Trump has surged so in the polls, notwithstanding his comments, very controversial about illegal immigrants?VARGAS: I actually think that speaks to just how little the American public knows about the issue, at least the ones supporting Donald Trump.  The facts that are not really out there when it comes to how Donald Trump talks about this issue. I mean two things that I think are really crucial, 40 percent of the undocumented population in this country overstayed their visa. They didn't cross that border. We have spent since 9/11 $100 billion in border enforcement. How many more billions of dollars should we spend as a country? And by the way, Megyn, you just had Marco Rubio a few minutes ago in his book -- in June 2012, called the American Sun. He actually wrote and I quote this in his book, ""If my kids went to sleep hungry every night, and my country didn't give me an opportunity to feed them, there isn't a law no matter how restrictive that would prevent me from coming here."" I hope by the way that question get asked to Marco Rubio tomorrow night.KELLY: That is why Ann doesn't like Senator Rubio anymore, because he switched once his bill didn't get through to enforcement. And do you think there is any candidate on this GOP stage who is arriving tomorrow night, who you could ever get behind, Jose?VARGAS: Look, I'm undocumented. I'm not allowed to vote. I'm neither Republican nor Democrat. I would really like to hear Jeb Bush and his actual plans. Again, this is the number one thing that we heard from people who follow Define America online. The question is -- this is actually a question from somebody in Sacramento, how do you plan to work with John Boehner and the others in Congress who are not willing to negotiate on immigration reform so that a comprehensive bill can pass both houses? What do they actually want to do? Specifics, not talking points, not names, none of that, specifics. We want specifics.KELLY: Tell these people to go on Facebook. We are partnering with them on this debate. And we want to ask you for questions. These are great questions. Jose, thank you.VARGAS: Thank you, Megyn for having me. I really appreciate it.KELLY: Always good to see you.Well, no matter how good these candidates are in the issues, history has proven that the real make or break moments in these moments come out of the blue. Dana Perino is next with her advice for the folks taking the stage, the things they need to do, and not do to ensure success, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: With less than 24 hours to go until tomorrow's main event, the candidates could use whatever last minute advice they could get before taking the stage here in Cleveland. Who better to help them out than a Former White House Press Secretary? Here with her list of dos and don'ts for the debate, Dana Perino, the Co-host of the Five and Author of, and The Good News Is. They could do much worse than to take Dana's advice before they go out there tomorrow night. All right, tick through a couple of your top points on the do's list for us.DANA PERINO, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, a lot of what I have to say isn't suggesting the points that they should make or how they should actually say something. A lot of it is all about the non-verbal cues. So first of all, you have to remember that you're on camera at all times. So that means at all times. So there's no -- don't fidget, don't pick -- there's all sorts of things you can do to distract...KELLY: Pick your what? They shouldn't be picking anything. Don't pick a thing.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Nothing. Ok, everything is on camera. I don't even know if there's a side view there. I also think it's very important that you have to figure out a way to stick the landing. What I mean by that is you have to know how you're going to end a sentence. If you're on an elevator pitch you can't trail off at the end and say you know, etc, etc. You actually have to say something with a period at the end of the sentence.KELLY: There are so many gymnastics references. Stick the landing, in a debate prep where we're talking about the dismount from our questions, like we need a different dismount. I don't know how it's going to go tomorrow. We'll be doing back flips at the end. All right, so non-verbal behavior is very important. And you pointed -- when we talked before to George W. Bush in 2000. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But can you get things done? And I believe I can.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I loved it. I loved it. In 2000, I was a supporter of George W. Bush. I hadn't even met him yet. And I remember watching that, I remember that moment and thinking he just owned that. He didn't have to say a word. He said get out of my face, I can handle this. And the other thing is they knew that Al Gore was what they called a space invader. So it's not a moment you can practice. But he wasn't surprised that Al Gore tried to get into his space.KELLY: That's fascinating. I've had some of those in my life and it's like really? You're in my personal space -- the cone, get out of the cone.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Sometimes you don't have to respond to every jab. You can just have like a little look or something like what's wrong with you.KELLY: Now unfortunately, Bush the elder made a big mistake. And to your point if you're always on camera, what did he do?PERINO: Well, he didn't even realize that he did -- back in the day when people didn't have iPhone's and they actually had watches. People had a habit of looking at their watch all the time. He's in the middle of the debate, his opponent is droning on and on, and he takes a quick look, and he didn't even know that it was a problem. So afterwards, his staff said oh, it wasn't good you looked at your watch. What do you mean I looked at my watch? But it became a moment of -- you can't do that because it looks like you're uninterested and you just want to get out of there.KELLY: What's the worst thing they can do tomorrow?PERINO: I think that -- one of the things I wrote was don't get a fake tan or use bronzer that will make you look unnatural. It's not the most important thing, but I think it is kind of important and I hope that they listen to me. They have to figure out a way to have a moment. So they can't go in there with five to six goals. You need two to three goals. If you can get two, that's great.KELLY: Yeah, the bronzer. Somehow I can't see like Jeb Bush lying in the tanning bed, but I could be crazy about that, great to see you, Dana.PERINO: Ok.KELLY: She'll be with us, we'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So this is it, right in this arena tomorrow night it starts at 8:50 actually. Bret, Chris and I will be up on that stage at the anchor desk and all the candidates will be right in front of us. We'll face off.  We hope you'll join us.

Smith: A week ago you and I were sitting in New York talking about the economy and I was worried about it. There are a couple things going on. One, I think the market always tells a story and it tells a story about what may happen in the future. We saw the worst weekly decline, Dagen, since October 2008. We all remember 2008. It was horrible. I think we have the underpinnings of something that could be worse. You know, we have seen wages stagnant for like 30 years now. We've seen housing still not back to its old levels. Demand for oil has dried up because economies across the globe are not growing, and labor participation rate is at an all-time low. Add those things up and I think you have some serious storm clouds ahead.John Layfield: Yeah. And the government has done nothing to help this economy. There's so much gridlock in Washington, D.C., on both sides that you don't have an immigration plan, a tax plan, you don't have any type of national energy plan. So there's nothing that opens up jobs in America. I disagree somewhat with my friend Gary. I think what's happening right now is the second largest economy in the world, china, is slowing down. You're seeing a reprising of stock markets around the world. You look at china. Goes from 7 percent to 5 percent. You say that's not much. Still going to 5 percent. That's incredible. But that is a 30 percent decline. If you look at this in a historical context, look at the S&P, 500 in 1995, 20 years ago, a four time increase in 2000. It includes two big dips, a 1,500 to 1,000 twice during the housing crisis and also during the financial crisis. Ronald Reagan over simplified it saying markets go up, markets go down, but this is a correction long overdue.Lisa Boothe: Well, potentially. Look, we've also had incredibly uneven economic growth as well. I think what's been happening here is the Federal Reserve has been propping up the stock market and there's no historical evidence to support that we can perpetually do this. I think if you couple that really with, you know, these regulations that we've seen under president Obama and this regulatory state, as I said, we could potentially be heading for a breakdownChuck Rocha: You know, it's weeks like this that remind me my papa was a pretty wise man keeping his money in a cigar box. We're creating about 200 jobs a month, unemployment is down from 10 percent to 5 percent and foreclosures are at a ten-year low. Obviously I'm a political consultant and this is not my forte, but looking at the 401(k) investment for everyday Americans, whether you're a small business man like me or a mom and pop, most of your wealth outside of your home is tied into the stock market, it brings real concern to me. I think it is somewhat of a correction, but I think there has to be a big change or we'll constantly see the ebb and flows the wrong way in my opinion.Donald Trump Calling to End Birthright CitizenshipJohn Layfield: It's harder than a yes-or-no answer. Yes, I agree for the most part. Look, this came out of the 14th amendment. It's an embarrassment to our country that we even need the 13th, 14th, 15th amendment to tell people it's not okay to own other people. Children of slaves were given citizenship. That should not have happened. It's not meant to cover something like what's going on now. There's two different points here. 400,000 Babies are born to undocumented people in the United States every single year. It costs billions of dollars. A lot of those people have been here 10 to 20 years. That is not the problem. The problem is the one who is get pregnant and come to our country and have that baby specifically so that baby becomes a U.S. citizen. There are distinctions. The latter part I disagree with and it's a serious problem we need to stop.Chuck Rocha: Let me give you the Mexican redneck version of this where I come from. There's no black or white. We have to fix our broken immigration system. Undocumented workers bring in $13 billion of revenue to our economy. We have a system that needs to be fixed. Chamber of Commerce, organized groups saying let's fix this thing. Donald Trump is throwing red meat to the right of the right and it's smart politics because he wants to win the nomination. We should look at these people as people. They aspire to be Americans. They want to be here. They want to pay taxes. But let's give them their shot.Lisa Boothe: No doubt that illegal immigration is costing our country money. The average illegal immigrant has a tenth grade education and poorly educated households, whether they're native, U.S. citizens or illegal immigrants end up taking more from benefits than they end up paying in taxes. So there's no doubt about that. Politically speaking I think that it is probably stronger ground for republicans to look at things like securing our borders, looking that you're actually utilizing the laws that are on the books and de-funding sanctuary cities and looking at things like that than looking towards ending birthright citizenship.Gary B. Smith: I agree Dagen. I think we need to divide up into two separate category, one, the economic impact and two the morality or sense of right or wrong impact. I disagree with Lisa a little bit. There's been plenty of studies shown, lining up with Chuck's point, the children of the illegal immigrants and the illegal immigrants themselves contribute more via payroll taxes, sales taxes, et cetera, than they take out of the economy. On the flip side, Donald Trump points out I believe we spend almost $50 billion a year on education. Now, the other part, though, that I think galls people a little bit is you're at the line on the ride at the amusement park. You've been waiting there for 20 minutes. Someone comes to the front of the line and cuts in. Is it a big impact on you? No. You have to wait an extra ten seconds. But it galls you a little bit that you put in the effort. I think that's how people in the United States feel now. We put in the effort, we lived here, grew up here, did everything right; now these people are coming over the border and taking what we developed. That I think is the issue as chuck so rightly points out we need to fix.Some States Looking to Tax Users for Streaming VideoLisa Boothe: Absolutely. This better not happen before the next season of ""House of Cards"" or I'll be upset. Your end up hurting online businesses and it stifles the economy. This is a bad thing.Chuck Rocha: A lot of us who spend time at work doing research or watching a lot of John Layfield rapping videos; we all do it and might as well admit to it. Tax that. As long as the rich guy is taxed the same amount I'm taxed, tax us all. Then you can reduce other taxes that are not fair for anybody. If you want to tax me a lit bill at a time, bring it on.John Layfield: I agree with chuck, which is not bad, but I agree on the tax. It's not fair to tax DVDs, shows, movies and not tax something online. It's not a fair competition. I hate myself for saying this but you need to tax it.Gary B. Smith: I would never publicly say that I hate john, but I do disagree with him and I agree with Lisa on this. Look, if you want to hurt an industry, we basically in the united states, we're reduced to two industries that we can really be proud of, the Internet and entertainment out in Hollywood. Take the Internet. We have the greatest innovation there. Uber, Netflix, Google, for crying out loud, we tear envy of the world. Now these governments because they're addicted to the revenue flow that they lost, they want to go in and tax, i.e., Hurt these industries. You want to see what regulation taxes do. Look no further than the coal industry. Basically the government's trying to shut down the coal industry with their regulations and their taxes. That's what's going to happen to the Internet innovation we've seen.Stock PicksGary B.

 Hume: Super Committee Flop 
"	The failure of the super committee has been widely attributed to partisan stalemate. But the problem is less partisan than ideological.The battle over spending and debt is being fought along the deepest fault line in American politics.Republicans believe deeply that raising income tax rates for anybody -- including the rich -- is economically dangerous and politically suicidal. Besides, they say, it wouldn't raise enough money.But Democrats, with equal fervor, believe that cutting entitlement benefits -- benefits which are the big driver of deficits -- is to attack the crowning achievements of their party's drive for social justice in America. Nancy Pelosi even directed her appointees on the super committee to oppose any such cuts.Bear in mind, though, that the super committee was not supposed to produce a balanced budget, only a plan to lop off about one eighth of the projected deficit over the next 10 years. Surely you'd think they could split the difference: some tax increases in exchange for some entitlement cuts and get a deal.But that underestimates the political wrath that member of both parties would face from their base voters for making such a deal. You can get politicians to buck their bases in a national emergency. The ballooning national debt may be a crisis, but neither the politicians nor the public seems to see it as an emergency.
