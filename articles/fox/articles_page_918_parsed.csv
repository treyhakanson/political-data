1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/09/08/clinton-trump-square-off-in-commander-in-chief-forum/	Clinton, Trump square off in commander-in-chief forum	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" September 8, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Mr. Eric Bolling and Meghan McCain --""The Five.""Last night Matt Lauer grilled Hillary and Donald like dates stuffed with blue cheese wrapped in bacon. There Hillary's e-mail trials stuck to her like toilet paper on a shoe.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JON LESTER, FORMER NAVAL FLIGHT OFFICER LIEUTENANT: As a naval flight officer, I held the top secret sensitive compartmentalized information clearance and that provided me access to materials and information highly sensitive to our war-fighting capabilities. Had I communicated this information not following prescribed protocols, I would have been prosecuted and imprisoned.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Hmm, someone get a bag of ice because that stung. Then there was this:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again. And we're not putting ground troops into Syria. We're going to defeat ISIS without committing American ground troops.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Once again, she happily tells ISIS all the stuff we won't do to stop ISIS. Hey, Hillary, why not tell them your Netflix passwords while you're at it? Oh, wait, that's too important. Speaking of:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I have been very clear about the necessity for doing whatever is required to move the VA into the 21st century.We're living in a technological world. You cannot tell me we can't do a better job getting that information.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So Hillary lectures us on technology. This, from a woman who's BlackBerries were smashed with hammers to get rid of sensitive e-mails. That's like breaking a thermometer to stop a heatwave. FFinally, she said no one died in Libya, which is debatable. Not a great night for Captain Pantsuit. But Trump didn't leave unscathed, either contradicting previous statements he made on Iraq and Libya. And then there's this on Putin:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating according to the different pollsters.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Yes, the ones still alive. Yes, 82 percent approval is amazing -- in that it's so low. When Putin's critics have shorter life spans than your average may fly, the fact that 18 percent are still critical of him is pretty astonishing. But Trump has a thing for strong men, he digs power based on fear, be it Russia, North Korea or China. He admires an iron hand, but still craves a compliment:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If he says great things about me, I'm going to say great things about him. I've already said, he is really very much of a leader.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So tyrants take note: With president Trump, you'll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.So do these national security issues really concern anyone? The reality of an unstable world and the methods one needs to live in it seem lost among generations cocooned in bonus rooms attached to Xboxes and iPhones. Foreign policy seems truly foreign to a country that needs it now more than ever.All right, K.G. --KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hi.GUTFELD: Did Matt Lauer give Hillary a taste of the future? Because they, they were pretty relentless on the e-mails. There were like five follow-up questions.GUILFOYLE: By the way, finally.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Good for Matt Lauer. I don't know why everyone is so critical because they thought that he was just gonna attack and bash Trump and give Hillary a pass. Somebody who's been like in hiding and the witness protection program or something for 275 plus days and won't answer a question? Look, I'm proud of him. I think he did a very good job. He asked her tough questions, in fact, questions that should have been asked and followed up on by the FBI in their investigation where they came to a rosy conclusion. So to me, this was actually very helpful. And I think obviously it was big moment there, right out of the bat when we had the naval officer who really put it to Hillary and said listen .GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . ""I would be prosecuted and imprisoned if I did what you did."" Again, different strokes for the Clintons, look what happened they get a pass, they get to collect all the paychecks and get all the glory, and get the cash while the rest of the people are suffering or dying in Benghazi.GUTFELD: And she still has to say thank you for your service through gritted teeth. The guy says, you'd be-- I'd be in jail. Thank you for your service. Eric, how do you think, how do you they did? Who won?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: All right. So, I agree that Matt Lauer was great. He was great on both. He wasn't just hard on Hillary than he was. He was hard on Trump, too. He cut Trump off, he pushed back. Now, there's -- today, apparently in D.C. is pushing back on Matt saying, he should have fact-check Trump's some of things that he had said in the past about or if there is for against the Iraq war, and trump clarify that later on today. I think Matt Lauer did a fine job. I also think the questions were outstanding from the people.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, they were.BOLLING: Every single on both sides. Every single question came as a pushback on some of the things each candidate had said in the past.GUTFELD: Right.BOLLING: It was fantastic. It was really a great hour.GUILFOYLE: Very interesting.BOLLING: I could have watched that for three hours .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . in that format. Interesting for all those who think that polls matter, NBC polls --GUTFELD: You'll never let this go.BOLLING: NBC poll, 68,000 when I left. It has responded 62 percent had Trump winning, 38 percent had Clinton winning. But I -- we'll tell you, for 30 minutes that Clinton was asked questions, she was asked about the e-mail scandal, she was asked about the Libya and Iraq failures, and she was asked about the Iran deal. And she was very, very thorough. She has a lot of experience in all three of those buckets.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: And the problem is, as I've been fighting with my good friend here, Juan, for a long time, experience doesn't equal qualifications. She is far more experienced. But if you go through the things that the y went through last night, you'll realize that that's probably not someone you want running the most powerful military in the most powerful country in the world.GUTFELD: Juan, Why does she keep telling our enemies what we're not doing? I mean, it like -- on one hand, I don't like the fact that Trump is complimenting Putin, but what's worse? I mean, that's kind -- it's just that, or like -- at least Trump is saying scary stuff. She's saying stuff that isn't scary to our enemies.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: No, but she's saying stuff that's true. The American people don't want additional troops on the ground. Remember when she .GUTFELD: But --WILLIAMS: . became secretary of state, there were 200,000 .GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: . American troops on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq. And so she's saying we're not going to go back down that road, which is what the American people want. They don't want us putting more troops.GUTFELD: But that's --WILLIAMS: Your point is --MEGHAN MCCAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's how another terrorist attack happens.WILLIAMS: Well, we don't know. I mean, let's not -- I'm not hoping for that. I think there'll be --GUTFELD: Nobody wants a war .WILLIAMS: Right.GUTFELD: . but some, that's not why you have -- you have war because you have to have one, not because you want one.WILLIAMS: Right. But I think that there's an important point to make if you're running for president, which is that you tell the American people how you would handle a crisis. She's saying here's what I would do in terms of air power, in terms of dealing with the enemy. Donald Trump never says a word. He just says, ""I've got a secret plan."" He impugns the president .MCCAIN: Which, he has a plan.WILLIAMS: . said that he has intelligence briefings. He's heard stuff that body language. It's very wild to me.MCCAIN: There's a misnomer that Hillary Clinton is as hawkish as I am, basically. And she was saying, ""We never going to do anything in Iraq, we're not going to do anything in Syria."" Enemies, do whatever you want. Continue the largest humanitarian crisis, 7 million people displaced refugees. Do all this. We're not going to do anything. That is the type of stuff that is been happening for the past 7 1/2 years under President Obama. What was fascinating to me last night, is that she still cannot answer eloquently, answers about her e-mails, she still can't explains to me why she's not a third term of Obama. After all this time and all this, quote, ""experience,"" how is she not better at this? And that's the only thing that was going through my mind last night.WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's important here to keep something in mind. I mean, when you're looking at last night and you see Matt Lauer unable to tell Trump, ""Hey, you know what? You're lying here.""BOLLING: About what, though?WILLIAMS: He supported .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . the war in Iraq.BOLLING: But he clarified that today.WILLIAMS: And so, I don't know about today. I'm saying yesterday.BOLLING: Why would let --WILLIAMS: He let Trump get away with it.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But I want to say something to you --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: What he did wrong?WILLIAMS: Not only does he go after your dad .MCCAIN: You call me, Mr. Williams.WILLIAMS: Thank you. But not only does he go after your dad, Meghan. He then comes back and says, ""Oh, what do you geniuses expect if you allow men to serve with women in the military?"" I think you and Kimberly should get up from the table because the three of us might attack you and then it would be your fault.MCCAIN: You know it so funny, that's --GUILFOYLE: That happens every day.MCCAIN: That's give him so much attention. And it's so funny. There actually have conflicting opinions on women in combat, in the military. So they have all the issues that stake. I'm more concerned with the VA than anything else. And quite frankly, neither of these candidates have a --WILLIAMS: Well, what about --MCCAIN: . solution. I find acceptable.WILLIAMS: So when someone, a veteran stands up and say, ""Here are the facts on the VA."" He says, ""No, your facts are wrong."" Turns out her facts are right and his facts are wrong.BOLLING: Twenty-two suicides per day.WILLIAMS: I'm just saying -- but he's scolding her.BOLLING: You're being so nitpicky at this.WILLIAMS: No, I'm not.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: OK.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Oh, I see.BOLLING: There is a massive problem with veteran suicides.WILLIAMS: Let me just say --BOLLING: Now you're worried that he said 22 instead of 20.WILLIAMS: OK. You know what?BOLLING: Which was, originally, 22 is the number originally --WILLIAMS: Let me give up.BOLLING: And then --WILLIAMS: But let me just say --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Let me speak to you as someone who is a republican, like Stuart Stevens who worked for Romney, right? He said if Barack Obama in '08 had said, oh, you know, Putin is better than George W. Bush as a leader, he said republicans would have said Obama, get out of the race. You're a disgrace to the American people. But what happens last night? That's exactly what Trump says, Putin is a great leader. We should love Putin. He has a high popular and everybody oh, fine, you guys -- oh, that's terrific.GUTFELD: OK. It's like -- I agree and I disagree in the sense that I think that he has a fondness for autocrats, but at the same time, isn't he talking about like perception of defending your country --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: It's not the country thing .GUILFOYLE: He -- yeah.GUTFELD: It's not necessarily the best comparison.GUILFOYLE: No, it's more of a strength model .GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah.GUILFOYLE: . to say that Putin will do what it takes .GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . to defend his country. But that's why Putin is dangerous and Russia is a major cause of concern for us .GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: . some of the intelligence community standpoint militarily and center for national security advantage point as well. Trump has said that I would like to sit down and talk to people, work things out. Well, guess what? Some of the evidence is that was, he went straight to Mexico and sat down and had a conference and a meeting directly with Pea Nieto to go over all this. OK, that. So you see the kind of approach, because he's a businessman. He's like, I'm going to pick up the phone, I'm gonna call that CEO and we're going to talk about this directly, instead of getting mired in a lot of the way down, you know, bureaucracy and red tape and having 25 assistants or deputies talk to somebody instead of going directly to the root of the problem. That aside, obviously I have concerns, right, about national security in terms of Russia, and China, and North Korea, and obviously, the problems we have in the Middle East. But what I do see is the right from the beginning that Trump had an interest and was very persuasive in terms of talking about the veterans and needing to make changes there. You've seen him come out with a lot more specifics. He's not in hiding or smashing BlackBerry or BleachBit himself to death like we've seen Hillary do or Hillary throwing her stuff, you know, under the bus. She's not showing presidential leadership qualities. And I'll tell you what, she's not making America safer by her actions and because as it relates to Benghazi, as it relates the e-mail scandal, as to the number of lies and obfuscation that she has engaged in throughout the course of this investigation and lack of transparency. And specifically, she's making America weaker by telegraphing and telling our enemies that we won't even put troops or boots over there. You don't know what's going to happen down the road .MCCAIN: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . in Iraq. This isn't an ever revolving process.MCCAIN: Exactly.GUILFOYLE: And you listen to the intelligence community, they say, listen, maybe it's ISIS today, it's somebody else tomorrow. We'll deal with the caliphate, but it's going to take years to be able to handle this. So you can't say that you won't do it. Are you kidding?WILLIAMS: Let me just say --GUTFELD: Secretary of state Guilfoyle --GUILFOYLE: Go run the Red Cross, instead.WILLIAMS: Let me just say that the American people don't want this, but I think the bigger, libel, the one that I just can't get over is, he says America's generals have been reduced to rubble.GUTFELD: Is that, does that mean they're demoralized .MCCAIN: I didn't thought --WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUTFELD: . by being ignored?WILLIAMS: No, no. He said this is under .GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: . Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Well, I know, I know generals who disagree with Obama, but I don't think these people are idiots or been reduced to rubble. What kind of say -- who would say such a thing? And so you ask about commander-in-chief .MCCAIN: He's saying -- I think he's referring to --GUILFOYLE: Render --WILLIAMS: . leadership, presidential stature?GUILFOYLE: There are plenty of people in the .WILLIAMS: Oh my, God.GUILFOYLE: . in the military and high ranking generals that do not feel that they have been optimized or listened to .WILLIAMS: They -- that's true.GUILFOYLE: . or respected by this administration .WILLIAMS: Every president --GUILFOYLE: . and they don't want a third term .WILLIAMS: With every president or every --GUILFOYLE: . of Barack Obama.WILLIAMS: Generals -- I mean go back to Abe Lincoln.GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, let just --WILLIAMS: Is just exactly they areGUILFOYLE: Hey, Juan, let's just cook the books some more on the intelligence .WILLIAMS: Not cooking books.GUILFOYLE: . so we'll think that ISIS was JV .WILLIAMS: Oh no, gosh.GUILFOYLE: . and opening ice cream trucks instead of like doing crucifixions. That sounds like a good idea.WILLIAMS: No, I'm just saying, don't disparage America's military. I'm surprised that --GUILFOYLE: Don't just --WILLIAMS: I'm the democrat here .GUILFOYLE: We have the best military in the world .WILLIAMS: . and then suddenly a republican --GUILFOYLE: . like make it strong --BOLLING: Go after that she's saying that Trump is disparaging the military .WILLIAMS: He did.BOLLING: . to a great extent that Hillary Clinton is or would as president.WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: She's talking about sequester. She's talking about defense spending freezes. He's talking about releasing this sequester, increasing defense spending, increasing the military, increasing our footprint in the world. I mean --WILLIAMS: This is playing cheap, rhetoric, historical trick there.BOLLING: By the way, he gets a 19 percent higher approval rating than she does .WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah?BOLLING: . among military members.WILLIAMS: Check this out, Meghan's dad .MCCAIN: Stop being --WILLIAMS: . and, and Mitt Romney, both did better with the military than Donald.BOLLING: Wait, wait.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: And I would love John McCain as president.WILLIAMS: Yes.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Oh, and what did Trump say about John McCain? Oh --MCCAIN: Oh my, God.GUILFOYLE: You know what? You know what I do know? That he endorsed him.WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Vote McCain, Arizona.GUTFELD: Last word, Meghan?MCCAIN: My family loves Kimberly Guilfoyle.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: And I love them.GUTFELD: All right, when we come back, Trump and Clinton trashing each other's performance from last night. Their critiques -- when we return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Well, we've given some of our reviews on Clinton's and Trump's performances last night. Now let's hear how the nominees rated one another.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Last night was yet another test and Donald Trump failed, yet again. We saw more evidence that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be commander-in-chief. He trash-talked American generals, saying they had been, quote, ""reduced to rubble,"" that's how he talks about distinguished men and women who have spent their lives serving our country, sacrificing for us. That's how he would act as commander-in-chief.TRUMP: The whole country saw how unfit she was at the Townhall last night, where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees, unleashed horror of radical Islamic terrorism all over, and made us less safe than ever before.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. Nice little juxtaposition there between the two candidates, each battling for the Oval. So who gets the prize of the award goes to whom, for the rebuttal, so to speak this.BOLLING: I mean, from last night?GUILFOYLE: Yeah, and their comments --BOLLING: OK, I think they both did well. Everyone said they both (inaudible). I think they both did well, they held their own. Again, this is 30 minutes of Hillary, then 30 minutes of Donald. It will be very interesting to see 30 minutes back to back where they can rebut each other on the fly. I think it's going to be awesome TV. But think about what's going on over the last couple of weeks .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . made in last two weeks. Trump has quietly rolled out an immigration plan with specifics and everyone wants specifics. He's got immigration with specifics, a black and Hispanic outreach plan with specifics. A military preparedness strategy with specifics yesterday and today rolls out a school of choice plan with monetary specifics. So he has pivoted over the last, he had a very rough go after the conventions. And now he turned it and whoever is talking to him, with Kellyanne Conway, Bannon, whomever; has got him on a place where the specifics are being rolled out. He's a more measured, statesman-like candidate and its showing. The polls have tighten or flipped. All the swing-states polls are tight. He raised $90 million in August. Listen, you may not like the fact that I'm talking about Donald Trump, but the facts are that he is now, this is a race. This is a -- it's no longer Hillary's -- the clear winner 61 days out. This is now a horse race.WILLIAMS: Well, you know I love you, but I just wanted to ask, why does he keep flip-flopping on this immigration thing? Last night he said, ""Oh, well if you served in the military, maybe you can stay there.""BOLLING: That's a great idea.WILLIAMS: Oh.BOLLING: You know how --WILLIAMS: I'm just saying, you said --(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: You said he had a specific idea on immigration.BOLLING: No, he rolled out --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I think that was the smartest thing .WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: . he's done in his whole campaign there .WILLIAMS: All right.BOLLING: . on the fly.WILLIAMS: OK. OK. Allow me --(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: But that just -- that something --BOLLING: Can we just tell the people --MCCAIN: That was before --BOLLING: Hold on, let we just tell the people --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: He stood up and was asked a very specific question, if there's an undocumented illegal in the military or wants to serve in the military, can they stay? And he said, ""You know what? I think that's a good idea.""WILLIAMS: But Eric, Eric --BOLLING: But that's brilliant. That's genius.WILLIAMS: OK, Eric.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: We would take millions if they would serve in the military.WILLIAMS: But Eric, I'm just thinking --GUTFELD: I have friends that -- that's how they became citizens .WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUTFELD: . by joining the military.WILLIAMS: Yeah, this is --GUTFELD: It's not new.WILLIAMS: it's not new. But Eric, there's no --GUILFOYLE: But it's all good idea.BOLLING: Actually --GUILFOYLE: You say, you know what, I'm gonna put (inaudible) .(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I got skin (ph) on the game. I want to serve my country. This is -- I want to make a commitment to you.GUTFELD: All right.BOLLING: You know, but then they have to go to the back of the line process, right? --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: No, no --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But let me -- was so, what is the plan --GUILFOYLE: How do get (inaudible) military family.WILLIAMS: What is the plan to defeat ISIS?BOLLING: Well, we just did that in the A-block.WILLIAMS: Oh, we don't have any idea.BOLLING: No, that he --WILLIAMS: He hasn't said, Eric.BOLLING: Did you hear the plan that Hillary Clinton laid out her plan? We won't kill you ISIS with .WILLIAMS: Oh.MCCAIN: Yeah.BOLLING: . troops on the ground. So he says, ""I'll wait and see.""WILLIAMS: I'm silent.GUILFOYLE: Bye.MCCAIN: OK.GUILFOYLE: Everybody.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: All right, that was weird. OK, Meghan .(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: (inaudible) it's ""The Five.""MCCAIN: Yes.GUILFOYLE: All right. So Meghan, what do you make of it, because this is kind of weaving in immigration .MCCAIN: Yes.GUILFOYLE: . weaving in the military, a stronger defense, a commitment to the troops, and increasing the numbers. How does it seem to you coming from a military family?MCCAIN: But you know, I think, again, neither of these candidates is blowing me away. Actually, I would like both of them to get more policy specific. Hillary saying we're never going to put boots on the ground in Iraq, we never going to put boots on the ground in Syria petrified me, simply because, why -- what if this continues despite out of control.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.MCCAIN: What if there's another terrorist attack? I cringe at the ideas of our enemies watching this, knowing much like the president we have now. You can do anything you want, you can jerk us around, you can harass our naval ships the way Iran is doing right now, and we're not going to do anything. We're not going to react. And I, I know you keep say Juan, that this is where the American people are at. I, 100 percent don't think that's where the American people at, because when there's viral pictures as a baby is in Aleppo with, you know, rubble all over them going viral, and then there are celebrities tweeting why haven't we done nothing about this? And like, oh, there are actually many people for years who've been trying to send aid then and this president won't let us.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.MCCAIN: I actually think if the American people understood what was going on instead of just being told tidbits by this administration, they would actually be a lot more supportive of the boots on the ground.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, I think ISIS gets it. They're like, yey, HRC -- I'm with her. I mean, right?MCCAIN: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Don't worry about it, we're not going to put anymore, you know, U.S., troops, our commitment on the ground there, that's not happening -- canceled. That's canceled.MCCAIN: That's the third term of Obama.GUILFOYLE: Unbelievable. OK, Greg?GUTFELD: Well, one thing we haven't talked about is Trump here -- keeps repeating the taking the oil. We should take the oil. And he said this line where he goes, you know, the old line to the victors -- it used to be to the victors go the spoils. That's not what America does in a war. You don't go -- you don't --all of a sudden takes all the fine art, (inaudible). It's against the law, again, I think.BOLLING: But --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: But, with the path we're on right now, you know who's getting the Iraqi oil? The Iranians.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: Right now they are going in .GUILFOYLE: Oh there's -- yeah, they're --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: . they are moving in, and they end up with the Iraq -- their own 4 million barrel for a production and the Iraqi 3 million but, there will be a powerhouse.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And by the way, we're enabling them, too.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Well, an ISIS too, to help --WILLIAMS: So in other words, United States, our values, the way that we occupy ourselves in terms of saying here's the way we stand in this country when we go to war, it's not that we go in and we kill off anybody, including families. We don't take the riches. We don't claim the women. My God, that's not America.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: But you know, maybe we could make America great again by doing all of that.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I thought (inaudible) that one --BOLLING: I think that honestly, to pay for the war effort of what we spend on the war though oil over the next 10 years, 20 years --WILLIAMS: Yeah, but you know, so what Matt Lauer --BOLLING: Easily do.GUILFOYLE: It's all the money, Bolling.WILLIAMS: When matt Lauer or someone of the audience says, ""How would you do that Mr. Trump?"" He said, ""Oh we --BOLLING: There's a (inaudible) in Iraq. You owe us --GUTFELD: That's not what he said. He said like --BOLLING: It was a hundred billion dollars over the next 20 years --WILLIAMS: What did he say? I thought he said put troops in.MCCAIN: Where --GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah, put troops in.MCCAIN: I think where he loses most hawkish republicans is when he talking about how much he likes Putin. That should make any person who believe in the American exceptionalism, incredibly uncomfortable. Putin supporting Bashar al-Assad, helping with the Syrian refugee crisis and, I think for any republican, he has got to stop saying this, because I was with him. I was with him and he said that, it was like, I'm out. I'm out. It's too crazy --GUILFOYLE: He just says it and then like, winks, it's like the Putin had take care -- yeah, yeah.OK, next, a very embarrassing moment on live TV for Libertarian Party nominee, Gary Johnson. The question he couldn't answer and his explanation for the surprising blunder, coming up. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: New words, that's all it took for the libertarian candidate to have disgraced his own campaign. Three words for libertarians who want their acres on the American political landscape to get mowed down. Have been watching this live in sheer amazement this morning, Mike Barnicle asked the presidential hopeful a simple question. The next 19 second is both stunning and scary.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE BARNICLE, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: What would you do if you were elected, about Aleppo?GARY JOHNSON, FORMER NEW MEXICO GOVERNOR: About?BARNICLE: Aleppo.JOHNSON: And what is Aleppo?BARNICLE: You're kidding.JOHNSON: No.BARNICLE: Aleppo is in Syria. It's the epicenter of the refugee crisis --JOHNSON: OK, got it, got it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: This is a former governor of New Mexico who is currently polling a 10 percent for the presidency; Johnson tried to mop up his foreign policy train wreck on Fox News, a short while ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GARY JOHNSON (L), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I was thinking acronym when he said Aleppo. And guilty. No excuse whatsoever. If it is kissing my chances goodbye, so be it. But I've always been served really well by telling the truth, and you tell the truth and you can get your way through things.NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS BUSINESS ANCHOR: It was a fair question?JOHNSON: Yes, absolutely. I mean, anything is fair. I'm running for president of the United States. So, you know, no complaints. Going forward, you know, all you can do is wake up tomorrow with a smile on your face, keep after it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: More proof that 2016 is going down as the most unpredictable and insane year in politics ever. Greg -- Greg, we've been say thing for a while. Boy, every day there's a new thing.GUTFELD: He -- it was so -- it was so painful to watch. But I've got to tell you, man, he owned it. He apologized. He says, ""Yes, I screwed up."" And, you know, there are a lot -- there are a lot of people that don't really care about Syria, who claim to know about Aleppo, but they really don't know. And I think it might be worse.You know, he says he doesn't know what Aleppo is. There are people who do know and don't care. So I think that, you know, what? There are worse things that are said. There's -- Trump has said some interesting things about your dad that I feel is worse, but that was pretty bad.BOLLING: K.G., you know, at first glance you look and you feel for that moment, that moment where it all goes away and you're on live TV, but this is a guy who wants to be the commander in chief.GUILFOYLE: Exactly. That's why when you asked me here when he was onset, ""Kimberly, anything,"" I'm like, ""No, I'm good. I've had enough."" Because I do not feel that he's an appropriate choice to be commander in chief and lead this country militarily. This is something that you should know.There's one thing to have an opinion. Maybe you have an opinion, you say something that's horrible, that's bad and inappropriate, you don't treat someone -- that's bad. But this is a knowledge-based deficiency about an area of humanitarian crisis of epic proportion that has been largely fostered by the inadequacies and foreign policy and ideology of this administration that has resulted in loss of life.And how can anybody forget just in the past -- you know, the child and the pictures and this human suffering and the tragedy? You better be up to speed if you want to be on the stage.GUTFELD: Can I just add one thing to this? Because I don't think it's the previous administration. The Libertarian Party has always had a problem with foreign policy. Their isolationism somehow exempts them from reading a map.GUILFOYLE: Yes, but that's not OK.MCCAIN: What's fascinating is, in this -- in this election, Libertarians should hypothetically be doing better.GUTFELD: Right.MCCAIN: Because these two candidates are so wildly unpopular. But what continues, when libertarians start talking and try to say this candidate should be the one, et cetera, I always think libertarianism is something that works well in a political science classroom.But in reality, when we're facing Islamic extremism and terrorist attacks, just saying, ""I'm going to be an isolationist; I'm a non-interventionist. We're that we're never going to do anything ever.Why are you surprised that he doesn't know what Aleppo is? He has no foreign policy plan.BOLLING: Because Aleppo...MCCAIN: He doesn't care. He's an isolationist.BOLLING: ... as Kimberly points out, that little boy whose family got blown up in that house. He's sitting in the back of the ambulance.GUILFOYLE: In shock with the blood all over him.BOLLING: That is Aleppo.GUILFOYLE: And that was everywhere.BOLLING: And Juan, the other little boy who's on the shore of that beach...GUILFOYLE: Washed up.BOLLING: ... this is a global crisis.GUILFOYLE: There he is. See the picture?GUTFELD: Yes, that's...GUILFOYLE: You get my point? Do you care about -- when he was here, and I asked him about children and ISIS crucifying children. I mean, come on, you can't, like, stand -- by the way, Rand Paul would know the answer to that, would know what they were talking about, wouldn't he?GUTFELD: But his dad would say that's not our problem.GUILFOYLE: But he would know where it is and what's going on. I mean, come on.WILLIAMS: Maybe he thought he said ""apple.""GUILFOYLE: No, he said he thought it was an acronym. Yes.WILLIAMS: But I just think -- I mean, it was crazy. I mean, but to me, the issue politically is this: can he get on the debate stage?So the news earlier in the week was Mitt Romney...BOLLING: It was yesterday.WILLIAMS: Mitt Romney said he thought that Gary Johnson should be on the stage.GUILFOYLE: Wow.WILLIAMS: And so here was Mitt Romney, who's not a fan of Donald Trump, saying, ""Hey, we want the Libertarian on the stage. It's only fair."" To pick up on Meghan's point, a lot of people don't like either of these two candidates. Bring in Gary Johnson. Gary Johnson...MCCAIN: He hasn't earned it, though.WILLIAMS: I'm sorry.MCCAIN: He hasn't earned it. It's by their rules that he has to abide by, he hasn't earned his right to be on that stage. And quite frankly, I think he's going to tank after today -- after today, because of this...WILLIAMS: Well, that's right, because what he's done -- when he finishes - - he's put about $200,000 into buying ads in seven western states and New Hampshire, where he has some traction, where he's getting some numbers.But I think after what he just -- and this picks up on your point, Meghan, I think those numbers go down. I don't think he any longer has...BOLLING: But -- and everyone is saying, well, what happens now? This will help Hillary if he -- he can't pull out. He's on the ballot. He's on the ballot in all 50 states. And I think Jill Stein is on the ballot in something like 30 states, as well.So all the polling numbers that have Trump doing better with Gary Johnson in will probably stay pretty stagnant, even if he doesn't make the debate stage.WILLIAMS: I don't know.MCCAIN: He's an isolationist, and he's pro-choice. I just don't see how you pick up a lot of conservatives around the country with those two stances.BOLLING: Yes.GUILFOYLE: That was a drop the mike moment, Meghan McCain.MCCAIN: Thank you.BOLLING: We'll leave it right there.Directly ahead, Matt Lauer under attack by the mainstream media for daring to ask Hillary Clinton tough questions at the commander in chief forum. He's getting pulverized for it. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Back now to last night's presidential forum on NBC. The candidates can't get the worst reviews of the evening. Moderator Matt Lauer did. Journalists, pundits and others blasting ""The Today Show"" host for going soft on Trump, hard on Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT LAUER, NBC NEWS: You were communicating on highly sensitive topics. Why wasn't it more than a mistake, why wasn't it disqualifying if you want to be commander in chief?HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well...LAUER: Were some of the e-mails sent or received by you referring to our drone program, our covert drone program?MCCAIN: Yes.LAUER: How do you think these people feel when the person running to be their commander in chief says her vote to go to war in Iraq was a mistake?You have said you expect the Iranians to cheat.Right, but you said you think they're going to cheat.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: The media is destroying Lauer for failing to push back on Trump's claim that he was always against the war in Iraq. Here are some of the brutal headlines. I don't have to read them to you. You can see right there. ""Lauer was tougher on Ryan Lochte than on Donald Trump.""Meghan, what do you make of this?MCCAIN: You know, it's so funny, because I kind of think with Matt Lauer last night, he's being made an example of. Meaning, I don't actually think this is about Matt Lauer. I think this is about people in the media wanting to say, ""Use kid gloves on Hillary, because if you don't, it's sexism. Sexism, sexism, sexism. You're asking her hard questions.""Do you know what I would like? I would like someone to moderate a debate between these two candidates who has no ties at all to Clinton Global Initiative, anything having to do with President Obama. Martha Raddatz had President Obama at her wedding. I want just political journalists with no affiliations socially or with charities with any of these candidates.And I think -- I think he did a fine job, but I also think that I would have preferred him to press Trump harder on Iraq, quite frankly.WILLIAMS: Well, to press Trump harder on Iraq.Well, a lot of people, Eric, said why no mention of, you know, the Khan controversy? Why no mention of John McCain, what he said about McCain? Why no mention of his own deferments on Vietnam before a group of veterans?BOLLING: So Lauer asked him and pushed him on why he thought he was qualified for the job. He pushed back on it.WILLIAMS: Well, let me just say on that one, that read like he was running for Miss America. ""Why are you qualified to...""BOLLING: Because he asked -- he asked Hillary Clinton what are the qualifications that are most important for -- to be president.WILLIAMS: That's a different question.BOLLING: He asked her the first -- same first question to both of them. Then he pressed him on why do you think you know more than generals? He pressed him on his dealings with Putin. He pushed back on all of them.And then -- he gave him a tough time. And then he turned it over to the audience, which I said, gave some of the hardest hitting questions I've heard in the whole campaign.WILLIAMS: OK. But the big -- but the big criticism...BOLLING: Here's -- just let me finish this thought...WILLIAMS: OK. Go ahead.BOLLING: ... for once. In 2004, Candy Crowley...GUILFOYLE: I know.BOLLING: ... fact-checked Mitt Romney live on TV and was wrong.GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: Was wrong. She set in motion a debate for moderators. What do I do? Chris Wallace himself said, ""I have to make a decision. I don't think I'm going to fact check people on the fly."" So you're trying to hold Matt Lauer to a standard that maybe not -- won't be present on the debate stage.WILLIAMS: Well, hold on.BOLLING: He did a fine job.WILLIAMS: You mean, this whole business about lying about whether he supported or opposed the Iraq War, that's a -- you can't say, ""Hey, that's not true""?BOLLING: This was in the ""A"" block, but he clarified that, prior to the Iraq War, he said on Stern that he may be in favor of it, and then during and after, he outlined several articles where he said he was against it...GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: ... including, I think it was Rolling Stone or one of those magazines, where he said he was against the Iraq War.GUILFOYLE: You know what this is? For me, it's like it's enough already. Haters are going to hate. And that's what's happening here.WILLIAMS: You think so?GUILFOYLE: I think that Matt Lauer did an outstanding job.WILLIAMS: Let me ask...GUILFOYLE: I thought he was fair and balanced. I thought I was watching FOX News. I thought he did a very good job. He was obviously well- prepared. He asked great questions. And this is like Monday morning quarterbacking, trying to nitpick at a few things, because Matt Lauer, I think, was tough on Hillary Clinton.WILLIAMS: Well, let me just say, Republicans don't agree.GUILFOYLE: Good for him.WILLIAMS: I mean, like Tim Miller, who's the spokesman for Bush, Jeb Bush, said, ""Dear TV Anchorman, change your interview style.""GUILFOYLE: Because he doesn't like Donald Trump.BOLLING: Tim Miller is a ""never Trump"" guy. Tim Miller is -- he would rather see -- he said he'd rather see Hillary Clinton win than Donald Trump.WILLIAMS: OK.MCCAIN: But I think the point is, above everything else, I'm more comfortable with political journalists moderating these type of things. I don't -- I don't watch morning television, other than ""FOX & Friends,"" so I don't watch his show. I haven't watched it in years.But I also think they should just have people who do this every day for a living and people that don't have ties to the Clintons, the Obamas, to anything having to deal with them socially, because I think it makes the America public uncomfortable.WILLIAMS: Here's one -- here's one of the lines of distinction.GUILFOYLE: Like Chris Wallace.MCCAIN: Yes, like Chris Wallace.GUILFOYLE: Let's have him...WILLIAMS: He's one of the lines of distinction. Here's one of the lines of distinction, Greg.Someone said they treat her like she's running for president and grill her, but they treat Trump like, you know, he'll figure it out eventually.GUTFELD: I think that Hillary expected a safe space. Because when you are in mainstream -- mainstream media, in those areas, she didn't expect to be taken, you know, he came pretty hard at her. But you know what's refreshing? Is the shoe's on the other foot.Normally, it's Republicans and conservatives complaining about harsh treatment.GUILFOYLE: I know.GUTFELD: We always are like, ""Oh, my God. Did you see what they did to Mitt? Did you see what they did to whoever?""Now it's the left going, like, ""Holy crap."" It's kind of fun.GUILFOYLE: Juan...GUTFELD: By the way, they should have robots.GUILFOYLE: Oh, that would be it.GUTFELD: The solution is robot moderators.WILLIAMS: ""Beep, beep, beep, stop talking""?GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: She wanted -- she expected a safe space and a little nap. A little nap in between to rest up.WILLIAMS: I must say, I find it interesting, though, that exactly your point. For now, the left is saying, ""Hey, wait a minute. The media"" -- and I think, you know what? I think it's all about the ratings. The media wants a horserace, and they're going to back Trump right now.GUTFELD: Now they know how it feels to be a conservative.WILLIAMS: Well, there you go.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. Now you're saying there's a conspiracy to help give a leg up to Trump?WILLIAMS: Oh, I don't think there's any question that there's one.GUILFOYLE: To help him against Hillary.WILLIAMS: Holding him to a totally different standard.GUILFOYLE: So NBC is the conspiracy, Matt Lauer is, too?WILLIAMS: That's what -- that's what amazes me.GUILFOYLE: Oh, wow.WILLIAMS: I'm amazed at this, because normally, NBC is over there on the left.Anyway, next, millennials could very well determine the outcome of this presidential election. They're America's largest living generation. But there's some new data which -- on which way this crucial voting bloc might be leaning. Our youngest member, Ms. Meghan McCain, has the inside scoop when ""The Five"" returns.GUTFELD: And brains.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MCCAIN: With the election exactly two months away, let's not forget about the power of the millennial vote. I am one of them.And interesting new study revealed young adults born between 1980 and 1994 are more likely to identify as conservative than Generation X'ers or Baby Boomers did at the same age.So my generation isn't as liberal as I thought. I love this. I love that this is bucking all the Bernie Sanders B.S. That all of us just want to be socialists. I'm actually not surprised at this at all. I actually wasn't surprised by this.Juan, you have children who are millennials. Were you surprised by this story?WILLIAMS: Well, no, two out of three, both boys are Republicans and pretty conservative, so...GUILFOYLE: They're so smart and handsome and accomplished.GUTFELD: They took after their dad.GUILFOYLE: Aw, Greg.GUTFELD: Except politically.GUILFOYLE: So cuddly.WILLIAMS: Except politically.MCCAIN: I have a theory it's because millennials grew up in the era of hope and change, and it was such a lie and ended up being such a disappointment. And now millennials are strapped with student debt and, you know, economic crisis and terrorism. And everything seems to be getting worse, and they're reflecting back that maybe liberal policies weren't -- weren't what's going to make America a success. So I'm not surprised at this at all. Are you?GUTFELD: Well, you know what I thought was interesting, is they looked at polarization.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: There's more polarization in this generation. I don't think -- I think polarization is across every generation. If you try to talk to somebody who disagrees with you outside of ""The Five,"" good luck. If you look on Twitter, if disagrees with you, you will get a thousand brutal, vicious tweets from ten people. But it will feel like 10,000 people, but it's actually ten people.And then this other thing. All older generations tend to obsess with younger generations. We like to poke and prod them like, you know, frogs in a high school lab.GUILFOYLE: Eww. You're mean. You know that's a bad sign, by the way.GUTFELD: What?GUILFOYLE: Like, torturing small animals.GUTFELD: That's what you did in labs in high school. You never dissected a frog?GUILFOYLE: Well, they were dead.GUTFELD: We didn't dissect live frogs.GUILFOYLE: Well, I don't know what you did at your school. I was at Mercy High School.GUTFELD: I went to Serra.GUILFOYLE: That's not a bad school. Not a bad school. Good baseball team.WILLIAMS: I will say this. I will say, moving along in this conversation...GUTFELD: That was the strangest thing.WILLIAMS: ... they are more conservative than previous generations. But it's still the case that -- and I'm saying this so I can irritate Eric...GUILFOYLE: Shocking.WILLIAMS: ... that they still would vote for Clinton over Trump.BOLLING: Even more.MCCAIN: Well, they're actually more apathetic towards this election.WILLIAMS: Yes. They don't like either candidate.MCCAIN: ... said that they were disgusted with both candidates.WILLIAMS: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Because the fantasy island is over, OK, people? Like, no more eyes wide shut. All right? They know what's happening here. And they're like this is not good. Now we've got to pay for stuff.GUTFELD: You just mixed TV and movies in one metaphor.GUILFOYLE: I'm that talented. So they say.You know who else is talented? Churchill. ""Any man who is under 30 that is not a liberal has not heart, and any man who is over 30"" -- I'd like to include women in this -- ""and is not a conservative has not brain."" There you go.MCCAIN: That's one of my favorite quotes. Nothing to say.GUILFOYLE: Put a bow on it.BOLLING: Well, yes, I do. And I told this story on the Labor Day special. I'm not sure -- very -- it's still momentous to me. I took my son, dropped him off at college. He's 18, just turned 18. And the freshmen students, there's probably 9,000 freshman there. And they signed up freshmen, they signed them up to vote. And I thought that was fantastic.Again, all the people who were signing people up had Hillary buttons on. So -- and they do push you in a little bit of a ""Hey,"" you know -- remember, this state is a swing state. I won't say which one.But I watched over my shoulder, and I literally thought he checked ""independent."" But afterwards, I said, ""What did you -- did you sign -- are you a Democrat or a Republican?""He goes, ""I signed up as a Republican."" And I've never, ever, ever pushed politics on him ever in my life.GUILFOYLE: Increase in his allowance?BOLLING: It was fantastic that he -- I was very proud of that. And it just shows that sometimes they listen.WILLIAMS: Sometimes they listen.But you know what I say to you? He loves his dad.MCCAIN: All right. ""One More Thing"" is up next.GUILFOYLE: All right, Meghan.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Time for ""One More Thing."" But first a quick programming note. Tune in tomorrow at 5 p.m. as ""The Five"" commemorates the 15th anniversary of 9/11. Dana went to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, today to learn more about the story of the heroes of Flight 93. She's going to share what she learned with you tomorrow. OK.GUILFOYLE: And with us.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Going to be good.GUTFELD: I'm up first.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Nutrition Tips.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Is that a doughnut?GUTFELD: No. I don't know what it is.Most important thing to know about vegetables, celery is evil. Celery should never be put into anything, because it just destroys the texture. Look at this young fellow here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(PUPPY CHEWING ON CELERY STICK)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: It's the first time he's ever had celery, and he wisely says you know what? Forget it. I'm not having it. So always test your vegetables with your dog.BOLLING: (UNINTELLIGIBLE)GUTFELD: Probably not. I know nothing about pets.GUILFOYLE: Can I tell you, I totally agree with you.GUTFELD: Thank you.GUILFOYLE: I just don't -- I do not like it.BOLLING: What, celery? It's hard to do a salad right without chopped celery. In a salad, yes.WILLIAMS: Juano.GUILFOYLE: I like it without.WILLIAMS: OK.GUTFELD: You've got 2 minutes.WILLIAMS: This morning on NBC, Matt Lauer, who moderated last night's debate, he had a different kind of guest. It was comedian Dana Carvey. Carvey had a lot to say about last night. For example, here's his impersonation of Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAUER: What did you make of Trump's comments about Vladimir Putin?DANA CARVEY, COMEDIAN: I mean, Putin has got him in his back pocket, because he's just going to flatter the hell out of him if he gets elected. Be like (GIBBERISH). ""I like your hair and you have a very great body.""""You know, you can have Ukraine, you know?""(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: Pretty good.GUTFELD: Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: OK, that was pretty good. So still need some Tebow? So New York Mets have signed Tim Tebow, can you believe it? He's so talented. Right? Everyone, like Michael Jordan did this. So he's former Heisman Trophy winner, and he's got a minor league contract. He's going to head to instructional league in Florida, set to report on September 18.And Bolling, you will like this. One of his batting practices, one of his hits went over the stadium scoreboard, estimated to have traveled 400 feet. What's he going to do? 100 K.BOLLING: I lived that life, that instructional league. That's a rough league down there. But a lot of fun.GUILFOYLE: He hasn't played since high school.BOLLING: I know, I know. Listen, he can hit the ball. It's all you need to do.All right. Very quickly, Apple yesterday, told you about the new iPhone 7 that came out with all the new devices, the speed increase, the speed to camera, the double camera on the bigger one, the water resistance, the wireless ear buds.Today, the stocks slumped. The investors on Wall Street didn't like it. It was down 2.5 percent to 1.05. Full disclosure: I own two stocks in the world. Apple is one of them. Amazon is the other. If Apple goes a little bit further, I will be buying more Apple, because I cannot live without my iPhone.GUTFELD: All right. Real quick, Meghan.MCCAIN: All right. A California high school football team is paying tribute to a member of their family. Before the game, Ashley Adamietz is a cheerleader who is diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, and her team put an orange rose at her feet. Orange is the color for leukemia awareness.GUILFOYLE: Aww.WILLIAMS: Cool.GUTFELD: All right. Never miss an episode of ""The Five."" That's it for us.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, new questions about whether Democrats are feeling some political panic over their White House hopes.  As President Obama suddenly jumps into the 2016 presidential race.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. On the same day, a new national poll shows Mrs. Clinton and Donald Trump running neck and neck. President Obama travelled to Elkhart, Indiana for a speech on what he called, quote, ""The clear choice in this election."" Some political writers are saying, that makes Mr. Obama the first sitting president to campaign for the party's likely nominee in decades. It follows a one-two hit for the Clinton campaign.Not only did this new survey from Quinnipiac defy predictions that Mrs. Clinton would be way ahead by now. But a second poll, this one from California, shows the Democratic front-runner facing the threat of a Bernie Sanders win in California next Tuesday. Not the kind of headline you would want at the end of a primary race. And one of the possible reasons we today heard the President sounding like this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The Republican nominee for president has already said he'd dismantle all these rules that we passed.  That is crazy. Have we really forgotten what just happened eight years ago? But don't think actually this agenda is going to help you. It's not designed to help you. Their answers to our challenges are no answers at all.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In moments, we'll be joined by Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt, former Bush Secretary Dana Perino and Richard Socarides who is a former senior advisor to President Clinton.But first, Trace Gallagher reports from California on this significant turn on the 2016 race. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, even before she began her White House run, Hillary Clinton was trying to distance herself from President Obama. Remember in 2014 when she took a veiled swipe at the president's view on foreign policy saying, quoting, great nations need organizing principles and do not do stupid stuff is not an organizing principal. And from the start of her campaign, Clinton has made it clear, she's not running for Obama's third term. But Hillary Clinton's perspective first term isn't exactly electrifying the Democratic base specially the young people who were so critical to getting Obama elected in 2008 and still hold him in high regard.So, instead of dealing the President out, he's about to beat Hillary Clinton's ace in the hole. And White House aides say Obama is all in.  Chomping at the bit to fire up the Democratic base. And while the President isn't naming names and will largely stay on the sideline until the Democrats have a nominee, his speech today in Elkhart, Indiana, was aimed at propping up his own record, drawing a distinction between Democrats and Republicans, and taking the job at the presumptive GOP nominee. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: And today's economy, we can't put up walls around America. We're not going to round up 11 million people, we're not going to put technology back in the box. We're not going to rip away hard earned rights of women and minorities, and Americans with disabilities.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: It's also been a couple of decades since a sitting president actively campaigned for the party nominee. And when Obama did campaign for his party back in the 2010 midterms, Democrat got trounced. And while the president's approval numbers are rising, some analysts believe that's partly because of the knockdown drag-out primaries. One final note, only once in the past 68 years has one party held the White House three terms in a row, when George H.W. Bush, succeeded Ronald Reagan -- Megyn.KELLY: Uh-hm. Trace, good to see you.Our panel joins us now to react. Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor. Dana Perino who is a former White House press secretary, co-host of ""The Five"" and author of, ""And the Good News Is.""DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": Thank you.KELLY: Which is now in paperback. Also Richard Socarides who is a former White House senior advisor under President Bill Clinton and a Democratic strategist. Good to see you all.PERINO: Thank you.KELLY: So, let's start with that one Stirewalt that it's been 68 years since one party held on to the White House for three terms in a row. The odds if you look at it from that perspective are stacked against Hillary Clinton.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Right. Trace mentioned about what happens in midterms. Very often what happens in midterms is that they go against the party in power. The same trend bears itself out, when parties try to hold on for three terms, people like change, they elected Barack Obama for change, and if Hillary Clinton is running as a third Obama term which is what he wants her to run as. He wants his legacy protected. If she's running as that, that provides extra challenges against the candidate -- to say the least a robust change agent.KELLY: Correct. But Dana, the question is whether Barack Obama stepping into this race, helped her, hurts her. I mean, obviously Democrats love him. And now he's got 51 percent approval rating in the country. So, we're talking about that sort of section in the middle and what effect he has on them?PERINO: Well, one of the reasons that President's don't usually campaign for the nominee is because people are sick of seeing them. And now, for 46 percent of the country that would never vote for Hillary Clinton, that's not going to be persuasive to them. But I think that one of the things President Obama can do that would be very effective for Democrats is, when they finally decide that they have a nominee, and they need to consolidate support behind whoever that is, Hillary Clinton.I think that President Obama can be helpful to the Democrats there, especially for the young people, they have great affection for President Obama. And his approval numbers being at 51 percent. I don't think they've been like that in about seven years. So, I think that's significant. Gas prices are low. Stock markets. Those are sort of indicators that you look at to see how things are going.But certainly it is a head wind for Hillary Clinton to try to claim both the nostalgia of her husband's two terms. Obama's third term and then to still say that she would be a change agent for the future which is what Americans are saying that they want is change.KELLY: All she ever says on that is that she's a woman.PERINO: Yes.KELLY: It's like, you're going to need more than that. I mean, seriously, even though a lot of people would love to see the first woman president, it's like, that's not good enough, Richard. She's -- I mean, if you look at the electorates, they want change. Two thirds of the country feels we're going in the wrong direction. And so, you think it's going to be enough for her while Dana points out she's invoking Bill Clinton, he's going to run the economy. President Obama, it might be his third term if that's what she's trying to tell us. Trust me, I'm change, I'm big time change, because I have different body parts.  (LAUGHTER)RICHARD SOCARIDES, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON:  Well, Megyn, I think that these are very interesting developments. You're recanting. And that we're talking about, I think that Hillary Clinton obviously stands for a lot more than just being the first woman president.  KELLY: She's the one that keeps citing that as evidence that she would be change.SOCARIDES: I think it's an important. I think it's an important thing that many Americans will embrace and you know, most, more women will vote in the upcoming election and she is overwhelmingly favored by women. So, I think that will be to her advantage. I also think President Obama campaigning for her will be to her advantage. Look, he's won the presidency two times. As Dana points out, his approval ratings are very high now. Unemployment is very low.I mean, we have a lot more work to do. I think Hillary Clinton will build on the two Obama terms and continue to get results for the American people.  I think that people, you know, elections are about the future. But I don't think anybody really when it comes down to it, very many people certainly are going to want the change that Donald Trump is talking about.KELLY: Women, Dana, he correctly, Richard, correctly points out. They favor Hillary Clinton, and the latest poll Quinnipiac poll today shows that. That she has a 24 point lead with women over Trump. Fifty four to 30. He has a 16 point lead over her when it comes to men, and women tend to vote more than men. So right now the deck is stacked in her favor.PERINO: That's true. However, I do think one thing that is a problem for Hillary Clinton is that she doesn't do that well with Independent women.  So, I don't know how they break out that poll. But independent women tend to be reluctant to support her. They didn't necessarily come out in great ways to support her in 2008 and so, obviously didn't have a chance to vote for her for president because she wasn't the nominee. Because she lost to Barack Obama. So, that -- for independent women, I think that that is a little bit of a tougher sell for her.  KELLY: Uh-hm. What do you think of that, Stirewalt? Because Trump, you know, many people say he's not even a Republican, really. You know, I mean, he's, you know, we don't know, he's sort of a -- an amalgamation of different ideologies. That may be very appealing to Independents.STIREWALT: Sure, that helps him running against the Republican Party. The Republican brand is el stinkerooni. It is 30 percent whatever ad garbage.SOCARIDES: Those are political terms.  KELLY: That's right.STIREWALT: These are very scientific terms. It's good to be running against the Republican Party and the Democratic Party and Washington. And I hate Washington, and I'm going to destroy it, and that's something that's very popular. But for Hillary Clinton, there was a time that Barack Obama would have been really helpful to her. That was when Bernie Sanders was dragging her across the scorching desert as she was making her way across the country. Now she has got it basically locked. And now he decides he wants to come out and be a progressive (INAUDIBLE) for change on her behalf.PERINO: But that could have come from -- that could have also been a directive or request from the Hillary Clinton campaign.STIREWALT: Yes, yes, yes, it's true.PERINO: I don't think that they're making great decisions in Brooklyn.KELLY: Well, I want to talk about that because -- I want to talk about what's happening in California because it's not good. Bernie is still in this thing. And Bernie possibly winning California is not good. And what's also not good is her -- he's completely ignoring the press at this point. I mean, in addition to these polls that we've been discussing, she's getting hit with new questions about her treatment in the media. We talked about Trump yesterday. You know, he thinks the media are scum to quote him directly. She must think so too, because she hasn't held a press conference in 180 days, Richard.SOCARIDES: Listen, Megyn --KELLY: Her campaign was asked about it. Well, just last week they said, what about that event? He refused to take any questions. Her campaign said, there weren't enough reporters on hand.SOCARIDES: Megyn --KELLY: That's true if you don't count The Associated Press, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX and many local outlets.SOCARIDES: Megyn, Hillary Clinton is in the press taking every day taking questions --  KELLY: Where?SOCARIDES: -- from reporters.KELLY: Where?SOCARIDES: Every day. She's calling into show.KELLY: Where?(CROSSTALK)Let me ask you a question. Richard, let me ask you a question. Is there a reporter in the country who Donald Trump has had more of a problem with than yours truly? But he sat with me, he sat with me after all that, didn't he sit down? And she's out there praising me, but where is she?  Why won't she come on THE KELLY FILE. Why won't she take questions at a presser? Why won't she talk to the media?SOCARIDES: I think it would be very smart of her to come on ""The Kelly File.""KELLY: When?SOCARIDES: And I've told her people that. And I'm hoping she will because I think you would give her a fair shake. And I think that --KELLY: I would, and I've been saying that for months and where is she?SOCARIDES: Well, hope springs eternal. You had your troubles with Mr. Trump and now that's behind us, and now I think before this campaign, I'll make a prediction, I think before this campaign is over, that you will interview her. But let me just say this about Bernie Sanders --KELLY: I hope you're right. I hope you're right. And I don't try to kill her, the same way I didn't try to kill Trump.SOCARIDES: Okay. Good.KELLY: I just want to have an interview with her.SOCARIDES: I think you're going to be fair to her.KELLY: All right. I want to ask Stirewalt about the polls that we're seeing. This California thing. Well, Bernie could win California.  They're within two points out there now. And his ongoing presence in this race, put aside the fact whether he can actually win this thing outright against her which, you know, most people say no.STIREWALT: Right.KELLY: But his ongoing presence in this race possibly through the end of July to the convention is not good for her in the general election.STIREWALT: As long as Democrats believed that there is some choice other than Hillary Clinton. As long as they say, well, maybe it will be lobster thermidor? No, no, no, no, no. It's Dinty Moore, that's what you're having. You're going to do this. And that's what it is. As long as they feel that there's some other magic unicorn, Bernie Sanders situation that could take place and carry them on to a cloud of joy, then they're going to withhold that final gas that she needs and if she loses in California, she will still be the nominee but she will close to the question mark instead of what she wants which is an exclamation point.KELLY: Now, Dana what the Democrats say is first of all, we point out the fact that she's beating Donald Trump in California about 24 points according to the polls. So, they say Trump talks about how many --(CROSSTALK)But then they also say that her numbers, her poll numbers like this national poll that shows her within, you know, a couple of Trump. Four points leading Trump. They think she's going to skyrocket once Bernie gets out. They think the Democratic Party will, you know, congeal?(LAUGHTER)STIREWALT: Coalesce. Coalesce.KELLY: Yes. Thank you.STIREWALT: Coalesce.KELLY: And that will be a big Boone to her and she'll run away with it.PERINO: But there is some evidence that that helped Donald Trump. Right?  So, when he was able to dispatch with his opponents. His poll numbers rose. Because people were like, okay, this is going to be our guy, we're going to get behind him. There's -- would say that that should probably be the same for her. And not to say, I think that President Obama is a net plus for her on the campaign trail.SOCARIDES: Can I just say Megyn, also, let's remember, that Hillary Clinton has received three million more Democratic votes than Bernie Sanders. So, even if the race in California is close, she has won this fair and square. She has beat him on the numbers, she will be the Democratic nominee. And I think the Democrats will be much more unified than the Republicans. Many more Republicans have not -- do not back Mr. Trump.KELLY: Right now, the GOP is coalescing behind. It's likely nominee and the Democrats --  SOCARIDES: Well, I'm not sure.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: It's pretty good.I mean, usually we want to see -- Chris can correct me if I'm wrong. But I think it's about you want at least 90 percent of your party to be behind you. And right now, Trump is about at 86 percent.(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)KELLY: That's a lovely number, and we'll leave it there. Great to see you all.PERINO: I win.KELLY: Thank you very much.STIREWALT: You bet.KELLY: lobster thermidor. What?The White House is also facing tough new questions about Chicago. The city run by the President's former chief of staff, and now seeing the worst murder rate in more than two decades. Almost a hundred homicides a month.Sheriff David Clarke and Mark Fuhrman are here on America's new crime surge.Plus, Hillary Clinton hits Trump hard on documents released today in the Trump University fraud lawsuit. Governor Mike Huckabee and Stu Stevens are next on how Trump is handling the fallout.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraud. He's trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump U.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton launching one of her harshest attacks yet on Donald Trump, as new details surface, from the class action fraud lawsuit against the now defunct Trump University. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: We're learning about another scam. The so-called Trump University. Trump and his employees took advantage of vulnerable Americans. This is just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraud. He is trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump U.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In moments we'll speak with Governor Mike Huckabee and former Romney senior strategist Stu Stevens. But we start with James Rosen live in Washington with these newly released documents from the case. James.JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, good evening.  Both sides in the class action litigation surrounding Trump University may have reason to rue the release of the hundreds of pages that were unsealed by the court. Trump University, a series of for profit real estate seminars, administered by a staff of 39 people launched in 2005. And as promised that Donald Trump would handpick the instructors. But the unsealed testimony shows he did not.Although Trump testified in a 2012 deposition that he did personally review many applications for instructors. Meanwhile, a playbook created for the Trump U sales force, coached them on how to market these courses, even to financially distressed people, down even to single mothers with three children who, quote, ""May need money for food. Money instructed the playbook is never a reason for not enrolling in Trump University. If they really believe in you and your product they will find the money. You're not doing any favor by letting someone use lack of money as an excuse.""Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks told Fox News, much of the unsealed evidence demonstrates the high level of satisfaction of those who took the courses. On that front, consider Tarla Makaeff, the plaintiff who brought the first lawsuit, who was seen in these documents enrolling in six different Trump U courses over a six month period. And consistently rating her teachers and overall experiences as amazing and excellent. Likewise the 2014 deposition of Art Cohen, who brought the second major lawsuit included this exchange, ""Prior to the earlier lawsuit being filed in 2011, were you unhappy with your experience with the Trump events?"" Cohen was asked.""No, I was not unhappy,"" he answered. In fact, the presentation that James Harris gave where he upsold me to a $35,000 investment was a very good presentation. In fact, I gave a positive review of that presentation.""  While alleging bias on the part of the federal judge who ordered these documents unsealed, Donald Trump is nonetheless vowing to take the Trump University litigation all the way to trial. Such a proceeding is not expected to begin until after Election Day -- Megyn.KELLY: James Rosen. Thank you.Joining us now, Governor Mike Huckabee, a FOX News contributor who also ran against Mr. Trump in this very race. And Stuart Stevens, he served as a Mitt Romney campaign strategist. And is author of the upcoming book, ""The Innocent Have Nothing To Fear.""Good to see you both. So, Governor Huckabee, let me start with you on this Trump University which, you know, we have done a fair amount of investigating into, because this came up at the third presidential debate.  I know it was going to come up. And I've done a deep dive on this.Let's just start with the, you know, it was all grand, everyone was perfectly happy and these people signed good reviews. The truth is that the director of operations for Trump University conceded under oath in the lawsuit that at least 32 percent of the students demanded and got refunds from Trump University. At least 32 percent. So there is no possible way that 98 percent of students were happy with Trump University. Why did the Trump camp keep telling us that?MIKE HUCKABEE, R-FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well, it may be 98 percent of the people who actually went through the course, not those who dropped out.KELLY: No, no, those who went through --HUCKABEE: I've seen some of these people --KELLY: -- and they want their money back.HUCKABEE: Well, that's right, and they got their money back. And that's part of the thing. Look, what amazes me, is that today Hillary Clinton is going out there and trying to lecture Donald Trump about fraud. This is like Pee-Wee Herman trying to lecture James Bond on the art of masculinity.  Hillary is the queen of fraud. And it has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not Donald Trump would be a great president.KELLY: Queen of fraud. Congratulations.HUCKABEE: Queen of frauds. There you go.KELLY: You know, Stuart --  HUCKABEE: I'll give you a new term, you can have it.KELLY: Listen, I practiced law for nine years. Plaintiffs make allegations and defendants deny them. And that is where this case stands right now. But this is a massive lawsuit, it's 5,000 plaintiffs, the class has been certified. It's a fraud action. Summary judgment -- Trump moved for summary judgment saying, we shouldn't have to try this, the judge said, no, you're not getting it, it's going before a jury. So, time and time again, Trump's defense has failed thus far. But he's going to get his day in court, and a jury will decide. You tell me whether politically, this is an issue.HUCKABEE: I don't think it is.KELLY: No, that's for Stuart.HUCKABEE: You think Americans really honestly are sitting around their dinner table tonight and the thing they're talking about is whether or not some people --KELLY: Not yet.HUCKABEE: Who openly said they love the course and then decided to sue.  Because they're going to get some money from it.KELLY: Not yet.(CROSSTALK)Hold on. This was for Stu.HUCKABEE: All right.KELLY: I want to get him in here. I'm sorry. But just to clarify the record again.HUCKABEE: I'm sorry.KELLY: Even those people who filled out positive reviews, right? Said that they did so in a situation where the instructor was standing right over them and watching them. They would make them do it while they were watching them. And on top of that, the judge in this case compared those people who signed those positive reviews to the victims of the Bernie Madoff's scheme, saying they basically had been brainwashed into believing this was a good thing for them, before they found out their retirement account was empty and they had nothing to show for it. That's what the judge said. Stu, you tell me whether it's an issue or it's not.STUART STEVENS, CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST, ROMNEY 2012: Sure, of course. Donald Trump is running basically -- not so much on policies but on his personality, on the essence of Donald Trump. This is someone who says that he'll pick great Supreme Court justices, but also said that he would pick great instructors, personally. He put his own integrity and his own brand and his own believable on the line in this case.Look, I when Governor Huckabee was governor in Arkansas, he did some tremendously positive things with education. One of this, policies that favor the student not the school. And this would seem to be something that existed primarily to make money. And why is it that Donald Trump if he is worth $10 billion is involved in this kind of tawdry scam. And it is a scam. That is the only word you can call.KELLY: And just for the record, Trump's got dozens of businesses which are successful and are thriving and are not -- not all of them are mired in litigation. Although a fair amount of them have been sued. But that is how America is in 2016. This is a different matter, Governor, because I mean, you don't get a class certified in every case. Trust me. I used to do class actions, it doesn't happen every day. So, this is going to be a deal and it's a fraud case. They're alleging that he defrauded, that Trump University defrauded single mothers, you heard James report with three children saying, get them, even though they may need their money for food, get them.Talking about the elderly, the uneducated, how they needed to be separated from their money. This is according to a guy who quit, who was a salesman and he quit saying, ""I thought that this was unethical."" We were bilking people out of 35 grand a pop, you know, these were cops and they were vets.  And my point is, these are allegations and in a political race, we're going to hear about this, are we not?HUCKABEE: There have been a lot of allegations thrown at Donald Trump.  And because you are a lawyer, Megyn, you know that when there are thousands of pages of documents, and people stand to make money not only the lawyers but the plaintiffs, we don't know what has happened. One thing I think would be a huge mistake is to try to litigate this in a five minute segment on television because that's not where it's going to be litigated. It's going to be done in court. Donald Trump says he's going to fight it.I want to point out though, Stuart, with all due respect. Mitt Romney when he was at Bain Capital oversaw 22 percent of the businesses that Bain invested in. They went belly-up. That's what happens in business. That doesn't mean Mitt Romney was a business failure because not all of his ventures went well. And I think it's incredibly disingenuous for anybody to suggest that because not everything Donald Trump ever put his finger too turned to gold. It's somehow that discredits him as a person who has indisputably created some very successful enterprises. Ty Cobb, the greatest hitter in all of baseball had a 366 batting average, that means that more than six out of every 10 times he went to the plate. He wasn't successful.KELLY: The Governor knows me, he does the math for you me. Thank you for doing that. Because in my head the hamster war running in the wheel and it was like, eh, math. Stuart, do you want to respond to that?STEVENS: Listen, if Ty Cobb ran, I'd be for him. I think the question here really goes to integrity, and it goes to, what is it that Donald Trump promised that he didn't deliver. And why in all the businesses in the world, one that preyed on those who needed help the most, because they needed to make money and yet the main goal seems to be separating them from what little money they had, it's a very strange choice if someone can go into any business in the world, why would you go into this business, I think it's disturbing and unfortunate. I can't even look at this and say, well, this makes me feel better about Donald Trump.KELLY: All right, guys, great to see you both.So, also tonight, David French is the man some conservatives are recruiting to challenge Trump. On Twitter, #French Revolution. But little has been known about David French until now.Erick Erickson and Jonah Goldberg have the inside story on what may very well be an 11th hour candidate in this presidential race. Next.And then, Trump supporter Herman Cain will join us on this response from Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The fact is, you can't win as an Independent. Let me tell you.  These people are losers, he's trying to make you -- he's trying to drive you guys a little bit nuts.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Plus, it's perhaps the most shocking teacher sex case since Mary Kay Letourneau. See why this eight grade teacher is making national headlines today.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So, the folks behind the never Trump movement yesterday dropped a political bombshell that is continuing to echo tonight. They're actively recruiting this man, David French to challenge Donald Trump by jumping into this race as a third party candidate.I guess to challenge Hillary too. Mr. French, his accomplishments include a law degree from Harvard, he's worked as a writer for the national Review and his service for the army during the Iraq war. But he is hardly a household name. So, why him? And could he do it?Joining me now, Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of National Review and Fox News contributor; and Erick Erickson, editor of the Resurgent. Good to see you both.JONAH GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you.KELLY: So, Jonah, you've spoken to him for about an hour just today.GOLDBERG: Yes.KELLY: Is he in on this?GOLDBERG: It certainly sounds like he's leaning that way. I just want to clarify one thing up front. I've recruited David to do nothing. You know, I'm a huge fan of David. David is one of the most impressive people I know.KELLY: Bill Kristol thing.GOLDBERG: Yes. This is Bill Kristol -- I found out about this about two hours before everybody else. And I was as shocked as everybody else. At the same time I think David French is an amazing impressive guy. A man of real character, and, you know, and I would vote for him in a heartbeat. Whether or not this is a good idea for him or for conservatives, we kind of wait and need to hear what he has to say.KELLY: Why would be it a good idea for conservatives?GOLDBERG: Well, one of the things that David was clear about with me is, he doesn't want to do that he is just going to be a Ralph Nader type from 2000, if he runs, he wants to run to win. And to be actually be president of the United States and not just simply to hand an election over to Hillary Clinton. And there are a lot of things on the checklist that are required to do that.KELLY: Yes.GOLDBERG: It is a very difficult task to do that and he recognizes that.KELLY: Isn't the best thing at this point, Erick, and you are part of the never trump movement, to stymie the election to the point where it goes to the House of Representatives. I mean, is it realistic for somebody like David French, as talented as he is, to win outright, has to do so many things to get on the ballots and then he had to raise a billion dollars.ERICK ERICKSON, THE RESURGENT EDITOR: Yes, I mean, it would cost $250 million minimum to do ballot access challenges around the country. And you've already missed the Texas deadline so you'd have to go to court to get that reopen. You could potentially throw this to the House.But the problem with that is, if you start in 2012 and just take the states Romney won, and David is able to take those states away. Well, Hillary still gets over 300 electoral votes, so you got to go into her territory and pick all Iowa, in Florida, in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin which is tough.So, ballot access challenges and whatnot, and you know, I'm kind of wavering on maybe it would be worth conservatives considering just if we believe Donald Trump is going to lose anyway. Letting lose and not have a spoiler in there who is going to be a scapegoat. But at the same time that...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Because you feel like it would be cleaner loss. You feel like he won't be able to say, oh, it's because of that David French guy.ERICKSON: Yes, exactly. Kind of like Al Gore in 2000 was able to, and Ralph Nader, and the democrats never had to re-assess and got their butt beat again with John Kerry in 2004.That said though, if David was able to get on the ballot in Georgia where I am, I'd gladly support him. You know, more than half of the people supporting trump and Hillary are supporting them because they don't like the other guy.The cool thing with David is a 100 percent of his supporters actually would like himKELLY: That's the thing, Jonah. It's that, you know, a lot of republicans now are saying we're going to vote for Trump, even though if we don't love him, because we don't -- we don't want to give this election to Hillary Clinton.But there are never Trumpers who say, I don't care. My conscience will not allow me to vote for Donald Trump.GOLDBERG: Well, that's basically the camp I'm in. You know, Alexander Hamilton said this, you know, 200 years ago, he said, ""If you're going to have an enemy in government, better it be the enemy of the other party, because at least that way you won't have to take ownership of them.""Now that said, I'm also a never Hillary person. I'm never going to vote for Hillary Clinton either. My decision is that these are essentially two, pardon my language, crap sandwiches and I don't want to eat either one.(CROSSTALK)ERICKSON: Amen.GOLDBERG: And we're going to mess that we're in. And so, you know, part of David's rationale is, they have polling that shows that just a John Doe. If actually voters are given a choice, a trump/Clinton/John Doe. John Doe starts with about 10 or 12 percent of the electorate.KELLY: Wow.GOLDBERG: That is enough to get into debates. It helps that he is not a politician. If you polled for congressman John Doe or congressman -- or senator John Doe, the number almost drops in half. The fact that he has a low name I.D. and he's actually a real human being might be an advantage.KELLY: Logistically, Erick, how could it happen? You know, given what you just outlined?ERICKSON: Well, there would have to be a lot of money raised upfront. You've ballot access deadlines coming up in Ohio and several other places, very soon. So he'd have to start petition drives.Now luckily in some places, federal judges have reduced the bar. For example, where I am in Georgia, the bar was 100,000 signatures. The judge just ruled you're going to only need to I think 5 to 7,000 signatures, but you still have to raise money, hire staff, get the signatures to on the ballot.It's a very daunting task. But my understanding is David does has a good bit of access to donors who are willing to chip in and getting on the ballot.KELLY: Married, father of three, veteran, highly intelligent, deeply religious, Harvard law School, major in the U.S. Army Reserve, Bronze Star for Valor, service in Iraq. Pretty impressive. Great to see you both, guys.ERICKSON: Great to see you.GOLDBERG: Thank you.KELLY: Joining me now with reaction, Herman Cain. Former GOP presidential candidate, Fox news contributor and author of ""The Right Problems.""All right. So, Herman, good to see you. So, you hear the argument, they don't care. Like they do not care if it hands the election to Hillary Clinton, on principle, they can't get behind Trump. And this maybe their guy. Do you think David French could turn into a spoiler in this race?HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No, I agree with Frank Luntz who said this on Fox News this morning. David French, with all due respect is irrelevant. You can find anybody with an impressive background but it's irrelevant.Now the thing about your two previous guests, they gave you all the reasons why this dog won't hunt, time, ballot access, raising money, all they did was identify all the negatives as to why this would be a long, long, longshot.They suffer from what I call, ""CDS,"" conservative denial syndrome and that's why they keep trying to come up with something that's going to change the whole political landscape. It's not going to happen, Megyn. They are in severe denial along with all of the other people.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But if this is going to gets on a ballot in just a few of these states. Even if he doesn't get on all 59 states, he could be a spoiler in some key races.CAIN: He could be a spoiler in some key races but he is not going to be a spoiler for all of the people that are voicing their support for Donald Trump.And here's the other thing I don't believe, and I totally reject. All of these polls that keep saying Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are tied. Hillary may be leading in some areas, we have a long way to go before November.I don't think those are going to stand up. Just like you had polls back in the summer of 2015 saying Donald Trump would not win certain primaries. Donald Trump would not get in them.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Trump would get 6 percent in June of '15, 6.CAIN: Yes. They said he wouldn't get to 1,237. He's already exceeded that as the presumptive nominee. I don't believe these polls. Now, the whole David French third party thing, I think will help to elect Hillary Clinton if she can get past a lot of the other challenges that she has.I don't buy, and I think that the never Trump people are basically in severe denial as to what the main objective ought to be, which is to defeat Hillary Clinton. They're in denial.KELLY: Herman Cain is rejecting hash tag French revolution. It is official, you can take it to the bank. Mr. Cain, always a pleasure, sir.CAIN: There's no question that I am.KELLY: Great to see you.CAIN: Thanks.KELLY: So, the City of Chicago, just reached a very violent and dark milestone.And up next, detective Mark Fuhrman and Sheriff David Clarke joins us on what's behind the bloody crime surge in some of America's biggest cities. Does it have to do with what we've seen when it comes? That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: Because something deeply disturbing is happening in places across America. Far more people are being killed in some of America's cities than in many years. And let's be clear, far more people of color are being killed in American cities this year, and it's not the cops doing the killing.Part of the explanation is a chill wind that is blown through law enforcement over the last year. And that wind is surely changing behavior.In today's YouTube world, our officers reluctant to get out of their cars and do the work that controls violent crime.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was the FBI director, James Comey, last fall talking about a surge of violence in some of America's biggest cities. And just a couple of weeks ago, he doubled down on that again. His concern that cops may be reluctant to do their jobs in today's day and age.Now the chill he spoke of maybe playing out in devastating fashion on the streets of President Obama's hometown of Chicago, a town by adoption. A city run by Mr. Obama's first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, a city where there were more than 400 shootings just last month.Think about that. Mark Fuhrman is a former LAPD homicide detective and a Fox News contributor; Sheriff David Clarke is Milwaukee County sheriff. Great to see you both. Four hundred shootings.Let me start with you on that, Sheriff Clarke. Just last month put that number in perspective for us.DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF: You can't, and along with that, 66 people dead. I'm trying to figure out why state of emergency hasn't been declared in part of city of Chicago why there's no curfew in place from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.The first thing they need to do is stem the violence at nighttime. Somehow they have to stop the bleeding, but Rahm Emanuel seems incapable of doing this. I just to know how many more black people have to be shot and killed, like director Comey said before somebody thinks that this is an emergency.KELLY: Mark, do you think this is part of the viral video effect as the director suggested?MARK FUHRMAN, FORMER LAPD DETECTIVE: Well, I think there's probably several reasons, one is the technology that every person has on the street, but this is kind of a self-induced wound that Chicago has created. This has been going on for 20, 20 years, maybe 20 years plus.To not go in or not support officers with task force type units to go in and attack these gang members. And let's be clear about this. Most of these are gang-related homicides, which makes it incredibly easy to target who the suspects are, where they live, where they geographically are.And like Sheriff Clarke said, you initiate a curfew for one thing, the most important thing, is you take the targets off the street. If you take the targets off the corners they can't be shot by a drive by and this is how you approach gang activity.You keep them up balance, you're very aggressive and you need the support of leadership like Sheriff Clarke. And unfortunately, Chicago that's non- existent.KELLY: Sheriff, do you think this is -- I mean, is this a gang issue or is this a giving up on gang issue? Or is this a cops are reluctant to do what they're supposed to do because they think they're going to go to jail if they do it issue?CLARKE: Well, certainly those things. But I also think that it is a culturally dysfunctional black underclass in the city of Chicago that's causing this violence. Look, the folks down in Chicago Police Department, I'm talking about the administrators not the cops, the police department has been demoralized by Rahm -- under Rahm Emanuel's leadership.They're not afraid to do their jobs, they're afraid of the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights division.Instead of having lawyers from the Civil Right division down there combing through things, looking to snag some poor Chicago police officer for some transgression, they ought to have criminal prosecutors down there, snapping up these gang members that involved 1400 that according to the superintendent have been identified.Get them off the street, many of them have warrants, do warrant sweeps, many of them are on paper, on probation, snap them up, start to question and find out all of the actors, start doing home searches under the law which you can do for people on probation and parole.And get these individuals off the street. but instead, we have lawyers from the Civil Rights division investigating the cops, this whole thing in Chicago is upside down, it is ass backwards.KELLY: Mark, I need a quick answer on this but do you think that there were -- the cops have been demeaned by members of the public?FUHRMAN: Absolutely. They've been demeaned and they're afraid to actually go out and do the job they really want to do, and aggressively be cops because the leadership directly in the Ivy tower is not going to support them when they've got attorneys from the Civil Rights division waiting to pounce on them for anything that they do that might even look like it might be a violation of the law.KELLY: The numbers are just so dark. Deadliest May in 21 years, 69 people shot over the weekend. And on and on it goes.CLARKE: At some point, Megyn, the governor is going to have to get involved. The governor is going to have to step in. Because like I said, Rahm Emanuel is proving incapable of being able to get around his hands around this thing.KELLY: People are being just massacred. It's good to see you both. Thank you.Up next, teacher sex scandals have sadly become so commonplace they barely make news anymore at least until this woman's story came along. We'll have that for you right after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: An eighth grade English teacher turned herself into authorities after a month long sexual relationship with a 13-year-old. Trace Gallagher has the report. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, the court documents in this case are filled with surprises including the teacher telling police the boy's parents did not object to the relationship and were supportive and excited about her pregnancy.Twenty-year-old Alexandria Vera says when she met the boy during summer school, he was mean to her then started flirting with her but she rebuffed him. Later she agreed to hang out and shortly thereafter began having sex with him almost every day.The teacher says the parents would even allow him to stay with her at night, and apparently they did not keep their relationship a secret at school.Students say they would see the boy touch her inappropriately. The teacher says she was planning to have the baby until child protective services unexpectedly showed up at school and she got nervous and had an abortion. She is now free on $100,000 bond. Megyn?KELLY: Oh my goodness. Trace, thank you. We'll be right back. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: What do you think? You think what's happening in Chicago is a result of that viral video effect? As FBI director Comey suggested, he didn't say Chicago specifically, but he said we're seeing it everywhere.Go to facebook.com/thekellyfile. On twitter @megynkelly. Let me know what you think.
