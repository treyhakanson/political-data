This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: He's in the process of trying to close Guantanamo, which is the perfect place for foreign terrorists who are captured overseas. He wants to mainstream them, frequently, into a U.S. article three court, which means they are going to get a lawyer and shut up.I mean, what you want the most from a foreign terrorist trying to kill us is what else do they know? And the president's policy is basically twofold, one to kill them, which may be entirely appropriate on a lot of instances but you're not going to learn anything after you kill them, or put them in a U.S. court -- these are foreigners not entitled to the protections of the constitution -- put them in a U.S. court where they are told to shut up.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell talking about the Obama policy on getting a detainee and what to do about it intelligence-wise.  We're back with the panel. Judge, you have been for closing Guantanamo Bay.NAPOLITANO: Yes.BAIER: What about this argument?JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, I respect Senator McConnell. I understand his motivations and, candidly, I am very happy that he and not Harry Reid is the majority leader in the Senate. However, he is incorrect to say that the Constitution only applies to Americans. It applies to everybody that's in American custody anywhere. That's not me. That's the Supreme Court.  And the five times the people in Guantanamo challenged their incarceration before the Supreme Court of the United States, all five times the Supreme Court ruled in favor of some form of due process. Doesn't have to be a jury trial in lower Manhattan, but it has to be a form of due process.The American government has not captured a, quote, ""terrorist on the battlefield,"" closed quote since 2008. So I really don't know the people of whom Senator McConnell is speaking.BAIER: That's because, judge, they are killing them.NAPOLITANO: Correct.BAIER: They are dropping bombs on them. The intelligence value --NAPOLITANO: Correct. And that is was the reason we have not had another 9/11 here because the CIA and the American military have disseminated the leadership of these groups overseas.BAIER: OK. Amy?AMY WALTER, COOK POLITICAL REPORT: Which part?(LAUGHTER)WALTER: Listen, here is part of the difficulty here in terms of walking this line for the president and also any other politician, which is if the argument is keeping Guantanamo open is helping to radicalize and foment this anger at the U.S., closing it isn't necessarily going to all of a sudden make that dissipate, right? There is still going to be a frustration there. Apparently, these brothers, what got them radicalized was the Iraq War, was Abu Ghraib. That's not going away. That's still part of the reality.But I do think if we are just looking at this from a pure political standpoint, I think probably more people would argue that American public would argue that having Guantanamo open and put terrorists in Guantanamo is something they still support, but I don't know that it's strongly supported.BAIER: Isn't it, George, more about this whole radical Islamic extremist movement that is beyond any one thing like Gitmo or anything the U.S. is doing and they are still going to come after us?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: The World Trade Center was attacked not once, but twice before Gitmo became a camp for these people. The USS Cole was attacked before Gitmo. The whole point is they are radical Islamists, they were before and they were after and we have a choice of capturing and killing them and deterring them.We can't, however, say looking forward to when we get hit again that that means that our anti-terror policy is a failure. We don't say the policing of a city is a failure if there are still murders and burglaries and assaults. There is only so much you can do in a free society with reasonably porous borders to prevent any eruption of this. Just --WALTER: Well, and what happens -- if we talk about homegrown terrorism, are we going to put those folks at Guantanamo?I mean that would not --NAPOLITANO: -- that would be almost impossible under domestic law.  It would be such serious violation of the Constitution the presidential oath and federal law.BAIER: We will continue to have these conversations about civil liberties and affecting our country, I'm sure, the Judge especially.  That's it for the panel, but stay tuned to see what happens when you combine college football and puppies.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: That's me in the thong, in the back, yes.Hello, everyone. I'm Greg Gutfeld, along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Bob Beckel, Eric Bolling and she sun-bathes on a Cheez-It, it's Dana Perino.This is ""The Five.""(MUSIC)Thanks to President Obama's domestic passions, everyone now can marry a cat, as sport teams with bad names are demonized forever. Horay for a fluffier America. There's just one small matter. It's called the world. It's a mess.And we got a boss more interested in feelings than fracking. He's not even naval gazing because that requires the talent to find your navel.As borders crumble and nations burn, he sits inside playing Nintendo and social change is his Nintendo. But now, terror is back and better than ever and one wonders why not play whack-a-mole instead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What we're not going to be able to do is play whack-a-mole and chase wherever extremists appear, occupy those countries for long periods of time and think somehow that we're going to solve those problems.What we can't do is think we're just going to play whack-a-mole and send U.S. troops occupying various countries wherever these organizations pop up.(END VIDEO CLIPS)GUTFELD: Well, if the war on terror can't be whack-a-mole, then what should it be? Wait until they come here and whack us? And isn't it your job to whack the moles?Here's the plan: You split the crazy from the sane, then you kill the crazies. If they want to die for Allah, that's crazy. And why not help them? I'd rather have them up there, than down here.The mistake was believing the war on terror was over. It's just begun. Terror is centuries old, we just woke up 13 years ago. The danger is mistaking suppression for elimination. Some kids barely remember 9/11. We so have classes on sex ed, so why not on terror?Faced with an apocalyptic possibility where the worst kind of people gain the worst kind of weapons, we must be ready. America must once again become the happy warrior through energy independence via fracking and a super deadly national defense. Forget global warming, we must stop global incineration.Remember when Al Qaeda was on the run? Now, they make Usain Bolt look like the slowest kid at fat camp, and they're coming for us.No charge can --BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: Who's Usain Bolt?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: World's fastest man.GUTFELD: A fast guy.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE: Remember, it's like the lighting bolt sign.GUTFELD: K.G., what's wrong -- what's wrong with whacking moles? We have ISIS right now. They're trying to take over oil fields, hydro companies. They are looking for weapons. They are finding them.What's wrong with whacking moles? Isn't that how you do it?GUILFOYLE: It's the whole point. That's why the phrase goes together whack-a-mole. They actually like it. They want to be whacked. It makes them feel important like you're paying attention to them. I think we should only be so happy to oblige, especially when we're dealing with terrorists that threaten our very way of life, our liberty, our principles, our freedom and future for our children.I don't get it. Like, didn't he get little cliff notes version of how to combat terror when he came into the White House? Because I still think he's a little slow on the uptake, the learning curve is taking too long.GUTFELD: I think he thinks ISIS was just a morning children's show. Bob, on this show many times, you were disgusted by the radical Muslim attacks on Christians and horrible things they do to people. Shouldn't your disgust extend to action rather than just saying how much you hate it?BECKEL: Well, here's the problem and I think Obama was right about this. What are we going to do? Are we going to put people on the ground in every place where there's an insurgency with Muslim radicals? Look, the RAND Corporation is about to come out with a study saying that in order to stabilize Iraq would require 100,000 troops and five more years. The American people aren't going to put up with that.We're going to have to accept the fact that there's very little we can do except let these countries go and protect Israel. That's about it.GUTFELD: So, basically, you're saying, yes, you'll get angry when Muslims do horrible things, but you're not willing to fight them.BECKEL: Where are you going to fight them? How are you going to fight them?GUTFELD: Why does the solution have to put boots on the ground?BECKEL: What's the alternative to that?GUTFELD: You bomb the crap out of them.BECKEL: That's easy to say, but where are you going to bomb them?GUILFOYLE: No, and you have certain strategic post to be able to gather intelligence and you hit them on their supply routes where they can bring food, supplies, everything in. There's a way to do this and be strategic and not extend a lot of U.S. lives if you do it right.BECKEL: The last time I heard that was about Vietnam.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Bob, you know what, this isn't a country of quitters. You want us to go, OK, fine, let the terrorists take over and abandon our most important ally Israel. You think Israel feels good about that?BECKEL: If the terrorists took over Iraq, what's the problem?GUILFOYLE: What's the problem? So, you're basically saying fine, let's just bring it in.BECKEL: I'm saying you can't resolve something that's 100 of years old.GUILFOYLE: Open the doors to the caliphate, let the terrorists take over, because what you're not getting, Bob, is that's going to be happening here. You don't seem to understand the connection. It's naive to think you can't just do nothing, turn a blind eye to the Middle East and assume that everything is going to be fine here because it is not.BECKEL: With all due respect, what's naive is to believe that somehow the United States military is in a position to handle all this without losing an extraordinary amount of lives and a lot of money.GUILFOYLE: There's a way to do this if you listen to the experts.GUTFELD: Eric, we've done this before. We know how to do this. We won this war. It's not like all or nothing.BOLLING: So, here's the way I see it. Let me start with -- the reason why we're failing in the Middle East right now and it's all Obama's fault.Number one, when he came into office -- Bob, listen -- when he came to the office, he first said, Islam is a religion of peace, in Cairo in 2009. That was setting the stage for what was to come next.What came next was embracing Arab spring in Egypt and Libya. That was OK. When it spread to Syria and on to Iraq, all of a sudden all those weapons we gave to the people who are fighting against the regimes, they started to trickle into other places. So, that's number two.Number three, this engagement with Iran is the biggest mistake the Obama administration has ever done. Probably any administration has done. For them to say, we're going to lift the sanctions on the Iranian economy, on the Iranian oil, on the Iranian nuclear programs, we are foolish. We're sending a signal throughout the Arab world that we rolled over, put up our leg like my dog does when he wants his belly scratched, and that's exactly what Obama has done for us. That's the reason.I have a couple of thoughts on what Kimberly and Bob were getting into. I'm agreeing with Bob on this one that we stay out of the region. But I'll get to that in --DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Go ahead. I'm OK.GUTFELD: I want to ask you, Dana -- been away for a week --PERINO: But if I look like Kimberly now, that's great. Things are looking up.GUILFOYLE: Oh, that's true.GUTFELD: Is this what happens when we fold up shop? When we decide we're going to get out?PERINO: I think that the consensus is building amongst analysts that 2011 decision by President Obama to tell America that we will be safer if we pull all the troops out and that we didn't sign the agreement, the status of forces agreement to leave troops there and didn't follow through on the political and diplomatic commitments that we had. Plus, in the last year, increasingly in the last few months, as Iraqis have been asking America for help to push back ISIS where they were, we offered a couple of hell fire missiles and two Cessna planes which weren't going to do much.GUTFELD: I have those.PERINO: So, yes, I think that power is a force of vacuum, right? If you leave a vacuum I think that's why strength translates into cooperation. You have to have something in order to show that you are willing to push back. One of the reasons that the Taliban said that they hit us on or al Qaeda hit us on 9/11 was because they thought we wouldn't fight back. And then we fought back.GUTFELD: And we're telling them now we won't.BECKEL: Yes. But, first of all, the problem here is not 2011. It was putting Maliki in the first place, who made a commitment. He made a commitment to include Sunnis in his government. He did not do that.PERINO: If they were, they were elected to do so.BOLLING: Well, first of all, Bob, we didn't put Maliki in. He was elected. That's what we want, free elections, right?BECKEL: He was installed first and then elected.BOLLING: Remember that's what we were all about. Let's allow countries to pick their own --PERINO: Freedom.BOLLING: Freedom, to pick their own leaders. That was Obama's -- in my opinion, that's why Iraq is going to be a free country pretty soon.BECKEL: Oh, come on. I mean -- please?GUTFELD: I want to go to some sound on tape. This is two Republicans thinking quite differently on this problem. You got Rand Paul. You got Dick Cheney. Go.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: What's going on now, I don't blame President Obama. Has he got a solution? Maybe there's no solution. I do blame the Iraq war on the chaos that is in the Middle East. I also blame those who were for the Iraq war for emboldening Iran.DICK CHENEY, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: If we spend our time debating what happened 11, 12 years ago, we're going to miss the threat that is growing and that we do face. Rand Paul, with all due respect, is basically an isolationist. He doesn't believe we ought to be involved in that part of the world. I think it's absolutely essential.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I always like when they say with all due respect, because that's when they insult you, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Yes, listen -- yes, exactly, then you know something bad is coming. But you know what? The other side doesn't know anything bad is coming, because it's not, because you got President Obama and the people advising him will put politics every single day of the week ahead of the national security interest. He has to make hard decisions.When you're a president, like President Bush did after 9/11 you got to do something and act in the best interest of the country. You can't always be poll checking, wind checking to see is my base going to support this?Do the right thing. Doing the right thing and making tough decisions shouldn't be that difficult, and I think standing back and doing nothing is not in any way a good move for the future of this country or all the sacrifice that we made to stabilize that region. Why -- when did we become a nation of quitters?BECKEL: For the nerve of Dick Cheney to say, let's not look back --GUILFOYLE: Oh, please?BECKEL: Oh, please, what? You want to excuse this guy? This guy came up with phony information about going into a war and said there are weapons of mass destruction that was wrong.GUILFOYLE: I think this is like feigned outrage.PERINO: I don't understand this conspiracy theory that people think Dick Cheney came up with something and he was the only one in the world that was able to affect change --GUILFOYLE: Because they're watching (INAUDIBLE) night TV.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Didn't Bill Clinton come up with it first?PERINO: During the Clinton administration -- first of all, we're all blaming one another when we should blame Saddam Hussein, OK? We didn't start this. OK, he did.All 15 agencies involved in gathering intelligence for the United States agreed with high confidence Iraq is continuing to get the WMD. So did the intelligence agencies of Britain, Germany, Russia, Israel and France. And yet somehow, it was Dick Cheney who convinced them all by himself this was happening? Where does that -- how does that --BECKEL: Well, where were the weapons of mass destruction?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: How do you say that Dick Cheney came up with a lie that after all, when all those agencies --BECKEL: He's the one -- he convinced Colin Powell go before the U.N. to come up with a bunch of boards that was absolutely phony.GUTFELD: But the great thing about this debate about who's right and who's wrong is you don't have to risk anything, you don't have to do anything.BECKEL: What do you want to do? You want to go back in there?GUTFELD: I want to exterminate terrorists whenever they pop out.BECKEL: How are you going to do that without going on the ground fighting them?GUTFELD: We were doing it with drones.GUILFOYLE: We've been successful at it. And Obama's actually with the drones.BOLLING: Can I ask you? We've been very successful at that comment, because I don't agree with you that we've been very successful.GUILFOYLE: Well, what else is new? We're not agreeing lately.BOLLING: This is the reason I'm going to agree with Bob on this one.GUILFOYLE: Yes?BOLLING: We're now seeing pictures of Abrams tanks and Humvees with ISIS fighters in them.GUILFOYLE: What is that, Eric?BOLLING: Why is that? Because Iraqi soldiers have laid down their arms, because the Syrian rebels that we armed who were supposed to help us are the same people who turned around and decided they want Iraq as well.GUILFOYLE: That ties right back into not having an appropriate status of force agreement to secure the region.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Hold on. We have pictures of United States senators with terrorists that we won't run here but run on other magazines and run in other areas, but we won't run it on this show. He's standing with terrorists. I'm not -- listen, we don't know who our friends are, we don't know who we're arming, we don't know who we're giving money to, we don't know who we're training.GUILFOYLE: So, what should we do? Go hide in a closet with our favorite blanket and a flashlight?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: No, kill them. You see a terrorist kill them.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Can I just say -- I do think that there is a small ray of hope with something. OK, ISIS is a group. Their method is to kill and kidnap. And that's how they have coerced people and they're supporting them. But that is not a long range strategy and you have people in the northern part of Iraq and in Anbar province, and the Kurds all saying, we're not going to stand for that back in 2006, '07. I don't think that ISIS can win hearts and minds on the ground there. So, there's a chance for us to at least push them back. I think we at least have to try.GUIFLOYLE: Thank you, Dana.(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: I think the best thing that could happen is have ISIS take over Iraq and then the Iranians have to be checked at the border. They can't go out and explore nuclear weapons. They are most terrified right now of ISIS. It's not the Israelis, it's the --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: We got to go.BOLLING: I know we got to go. There are three different factions. You have Iraqi military, you have al Qaeda, and you have ISIS. You have three different groups.Forget about the Sunnis in the north or the Kurds in the north, forget all that. It's so convoluted. It's a mess.There's no reason to continue to spend money and put assets on the ground. You want to drone them, I agree with you. Drone the hell out of them.GUILFOYLE: But that's our point. You can sit there and not do anything. Why can't you just cut them off at the pass? There are ways to do it.GUTFELD: We got -- we are beginning to drone.Directly ahead, Hillary Clinton and her claims about her family's post- White House financial problems. Is she completely tone deaf like that tease? We'll debate it.Later, is our resident soccer skeptic catching World Cup fever? Is it the flu? More of Bob's fancy footwork and his new soccer pals, ahead on THE FIVE.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: All right. It's so hard to be a Clinton, at least according to Hillary. You remember earlier this month when she made this claim?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: We came out of the White House not only dead broke but in debt. We had no money when we got there and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea's education. You know, it was not easy.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Well, she's back at it in an interview with Britain's ""The Guardian"" newspaper. Clinton was asked if she could be a sincere voice in the fight against income inequality given her extreme wealth. Her response, she and her Bill are not, quote, ""truly well off like some others."" Some Democratic officials fear that her long existence in the rarified air could turn off working class voters, that's the bloc that's essentially to Democratic hopes in 2016.Eric, I want to start with you. Do you remember when the liberals attacked Mitt Romney relentlessly for being too out of touch and just a rich white guy that didn't pay enough taxes?BOLLING: Right. They destroyed him. Harry Reid has somehow figured out what his tax rate was and he wasn't paying taxes. I just find it just absolutely astonishing that she doubled down on one of the most ridiculous comment she's ever made. We left the White House broke. We didn't know how to get a mortgage.Give me a break. They made $12 million the year they left the White House, $12 million that year. So, if you're going to go out and say and get destroyed for it, don't go doubling down and say, oh, we're not as well off as other people. What do you mean? You're not as well off as the billionaires who are funding your stupid 2016 -- out of control.Dana, if you were an adviser, you would probably tell her, hand me the shovel --PERINO: That's the point. Do you think, Greg, that she's comparing herself to people that she's gotten to know as he left the White House that are uber wealthy? And she thinks, well, I'm not as wealthy as they are?GUTFELD: Perhaps.PERINO: If you're being kind.GUTFELD: But -- I mean, she's put her foot inside her mouth so many times she has athlete's teeth. She's makes Mitt Romney look like Al Bundy. I think there's a realization going on that Hillary isn't just a lemon, she's a lemon factory. But I believe that the Republicans can still screw it up by nominating someone just as bad.PERINO: Hey, let me ask you quickly. When you were out in the world, were there people high on Hillary, or down on here?GUTFELD: They were high on something, because I was in Lake Tahoe.But I will say this, most of the people that owned businesses there are FOX News fans and people that don't own anything are not.PERINO: Aha, that's an interesting thing.Kimberly, do you think with two weeks that we've had of her book tour, do you think she's any closer of making a decision as to whether she will run for president?GUILFOYLE: I think she wants to write an email, she would like to retract (ph) that email, and rollout and the book and the dumb blank statements.This is not good. I honestly expected a lot more from her, because say what you will, the woman, you know, is accomplished. She's very bright. She's politically savvy. But she's not playing at her A-game level. This is J.V. People expect varsity at this point. This is not what we're getting.And making comments like this, she's going to alienate everybody. I mean, it doesn't sound good to anyone to hear this kind of thing. You pay -- remember the witch-hunt against Mitt Romney. I don't think people have such a long memory for that.PERINO: Bob, do you -- do you think politically her instincts might be off or do you think that she needs a revamped campaign strategy or does she not need a strategy. What do you think?BECKEL: I think this is a classic case of front-runneritis where everything is done by committee, everything is done to avoid controversy. That book of hers, I flipped through it. It reminder me of briefing papers put together fore presidential candidate, where everybody had their word in the thing.Every time she answers these things, she does dig herself deeper in the hole. It's classic in my mind of a front-runner -- who's never had -- we never had a front-runner this long. I still believe, though, in the end, she's going to make a decision not to run.BOLLING: So, can I ask you, Dana? Wouldn't you think people around her would say, we're broke and how everyone picked it up left and right, wouldn't you think someone say, hey, Hillary, next time something like that comes up, go somewhere else with it, instead of --PERINO: Yes, of course. And maybe they did. Maybe she is not that into her staff or what they have to say or maybe they did. Or maybe she's unapproachable that way. Or maybe she's --GUILFOYLE: But isn't she sort of unapproachable, Dana?PERINO: Well, maybe she's saying to her team I have a book, I want to sell the book, I'm not worried about the presidential campaign. I worry about that later. I'll just think that that would be a little dicey.I have to tease, I'm sorry. But you want to make one point?BECKEL: One fast point. If I were Hillary Clinton I would look at this NBC/ ""Wall Street Journal"" poll showing that her --PERINO: We have that.BECKEL: -- return -- what?PERINO: Go ahead, yes, because we have that.BECKEL: We have return -- Clinton as president represents a return to past policies, 49 percent, would provide new ideas and vision 42 percent. That is not a healthy way to be going -- PERINO: That's why I wonder if she decides to run if she has to write another book, so we can hear about all of those things.GUILFOYLE: She's going to write a new book to clean --PERINO: All right. Ahead, another things I want to ask about, but we've got to go.When we come back, he's one of the world's most iconic musicians but is he also stingy? Surprising news about Sting and what he plans to do and not to do with his multimillion dollar fortune, next on ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)BOLLING: Legendary musician sting is on a mission to teach his kids the value of a buck. The sixth time Grammy Award winner and former front man of the police, one of my favorite bands, has an estimated net worth of about $300 million, and his kids may not see a dime of it. The singer says he expects his six kids to work and earn their own money, telling them that there won't be much money left over because he and his wife are, quote, ""spending it.""Greg, you like the Police but don't like Sting. It just adds to that?GUTFELD: Yes, first off, just a point of fact. Sting does naked yoga on the beach, so just think about the poor sand.GUILFOYLE: OK.GUTFELD: Police is one of the greatest bands ever. Sting, how awful he became after he left the band. His music is for lonely divorcees dancing in front of a mirror holding Chablis (ph), you know, cooing to their cat, makes me want to throw up.GUILFOYLE: I don't do that.GUTFELD: The worse thing to give your kid is money other than hepatitis.But, no, you got to help your kids out. When your kids start working and start trying to make money, then you give them money. But if you give them money too soon, you screw them for life.BOLLING: I'm going to go, K.G., your going to leave some of your $300 million of fortune to Ro Digs (ph)?GUILFOYLE: No, Ro Digs only makes money when he pulls his teeth out, for real, gets 20 bucks this weekend.PERINO: Twenty dollars for a tooth?GUILFOYLE: Yes, that's all I had. I mean, the tooth fairy had.BOLLING: What about this idea? You got 300 mil, you're going to stiff the kids?GUILFOYLE: No. I wouldn't do that, but I would try and come up with a creative way to make sure, in case they were, like, failures, they had something to fall back on. But I would give money to charity. I would lead by example and tell them that, listen, if I made it, you can, too. And by all accounts his children are successful in their own right.PERINO: Of course they are. And this is why this doesn't matter.GUILFOYLE: Why?PERINO: If you are one of Sting's six children, you already have all the connections you're ever going to need. You call somebody and say, ""Hi, I'd like a job here.""""Oh, OK, great. We'll sign you right up. Here's your 401(k) plan."" They will -- they're never going to have a problem in their lives.BECKEL: I agree with Greg. If you're going to leave money to your kids do it when they're 35 and have a trustee overseeing it. And if they are screw ups, they don't get it. My guess is an awful lot of his charities will give to the charities he's .PERINO: He said they're spending it.GUILFOYLE: He just said he -- so Bob, he just said that he and his wife are spending it. He didn't say charity.BOLLING: But he -- he's spending it on AIDS in Africa and other things like that. I think that's ...I grew up watching my parents struggle. I mean literally we were very, very poor. Poor. And that I think motivated me to work hard and become successful.You're a money bag.BOLLING: I don't think it's wise to let your kids know that they're going to inherit $50, $60 million each when you pass away.First of all, they'll be waiting for you to pass away, and then they're going to be lazy. Not teaching them right.OK. One other story. ""Wall Street Journal,"" saying 15 grand to hang out with celebrities. Is there anyone at the table that ou would pay to hang out with?GUTFELD: No. I think that's disgusting. You know what? There's a difference between fame and popularity. When millions of people know who you are, that's fame. When a few people like you, that's popularity. You can't -- you can't confuse the two. Being famous is hell. Being liked is heaven.GUILFOYLE: Oh, you know?GUTFELD: I'm just saying. It's not a good thing to be known by a lot of people because they don't even like you. They're just going, ""Oh, it's you,"" and then they want a picture with you but they don't even know why. I see that happening when people are at the airport. And I'm just happy to be alone.BOLLING: Usually, they are tapping me on the shoulder and saying, ""Hey, sir can you take a picture of Kimberly and I?"" And I'm the one holding the camera.GUILFOYLE: You do take good photos.BOLLING: Thank you. Would you pay to hang out with anyone?PERINO: I would not. I prefer to, you know, earn it on the merits.GUTFELD: Women never have to pay.PERINO: But I do think making celebrities. We're talking about celebrities. But just last week when President Obama was here and he had that fundraiser, it was $32,000 a plate. So people are willing to pay $32,000 to see him.BOLLING: Correct.BECKEL: I'll tell you, I would pay $15,000 to hang out with Elvis. .BOLLING: With Elvis? He's dead. The real Elvis.GUILFOYLE: The real Elvis.BECKEL: That's right. But get him back somehow or another. If you can get him bring him back for a day, I'd pay 15 grand.GUTFELD: That's not fair. You can't play dead people.BECKEL: Oh, you can't?GUTFELD: No.BECKEL: Then the answer is absolutely not.GUILFOYLE: I would pay to hang out if, you know, it went to a really good cause, a really great charity and it was something that I felt I could, you know, learn something from.BOLLING: I got one for you.GUILFOYLE: What?BOLLING: If you're going to donate to charity anyway, how about 15 grand, donate to charity, hang out with the pope.GUILFOYLE: The pope is not going hang out with me.PERINO: This is the other thing, is that you know if you're paying for it, the celebrities don't want to be with you anyway. They think of you as, like, a little irritant and that they have to deal with for a couple of hours.GUTFELD: Is this how you feel?BECKEL: That's true. Whenever they do those raffles and things for celebrities to go to lunch, if you ever see pictures of the lunch, they look like they're about ready to throw up.PERINO: Yes. They don't want to be there.BOLLING: All right. Nina's telling me we have to go.GUTFELD: I paid $100 to be with Pauly Shore.BECKEL: Oh?GUILFOYLE: Did you get the money back?BOLLING: We'll just leave it right there. You see how they take the wides out? Take the wide. Click on the wide.A self-proclaimed feminist father posted this photo of rules for dating his daughter, and it's gone viral. It ends with the line: ""Her body, her rules."" What do ""The Five""ers think of this message? Find out next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC: WHITESNAKE, ""HERE I GO AGAIN"")GUILFOYLE: Love it. Now that, you can dance to.OK. Chuck Spear, proud dad from New Jersey, is getting a lot of heat after posting this photo of himself sporting a shirt that read ""Rules for dating my daughter. No. 1 I don't make the rules. Two, you don't make the rules. Three, she makes rules. Four, her body, her rules. Signed feminist father.""Well, the 20-year-old Christine Spear reportedly says her dad is sincere about feminism, and the shirt is not a gimmick.The picture has gone viral on social media, but what does ""The Five"" think of the message this father is sending? Daddies? Ready to participate?GUTFELD: I have a daughter.GUILFOYLE: Yes, this is a good point. What about McKenzie?BECKEL: I would not have those rules for my daughter, but she's not old enough to -- this girl is 20 years old. She's got the right to do whatever she wants. Her father is cashing in, clearly, here. I don't believe for a second he's a feminist. I bet his daughter hasn't seen him in five years.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh. Bob, let's not make stuff up. Everything.GUTFELD: You are so bad.GUILFOYLE: That's terrible. Bolling.BOLLING: What makes him a feminist by saying she makes the rules?PERINO: Isn't that what you're all taught? Isn't that what you're all taught?BOLLING: It's this logic. In other words, if she doesn't want to do anything...GUILFOYLE: Isn't it the same thing, like, for guys? Like Bob's body -- God help us -- is his body; he makes the rules.BECKEL: What the hell are you talking about? Just because you've got a good body you don't take shots at the rest of us.GUILFOYLE: I wasn't saying it like that.BECKEL: I wouldn't wear that purple outfit, but I -- it shows off the best for you.BOLLING: Oh, my God.GUILFOYLE: You ruined my segment again. OK. Dana.PERINO: You kind of asked for it, though.GUILFOYLE: I was just saying why does this apply to guys? I wasn't saying...PERINO: I just think this whole thing is dumb. At 20 years old, you should -- of course, you make the rules for your body. And if you are a gentleman that you are raised to know that, of course, a woman -- this is all -- I think this is ridiculous.If you at 20 need to have your father's permission or some sort of, like, sign that your dad wears around to reaffirm what should just be obvious and a given, then you have problems.GUILFOYLE: Is he like a, you know, Chevy Chase kind of father, like he's a jokester?BECKEL: I'll tell you what I do at my daughter's first dates. I say very simply, ""She's due back at midnight. If she's not there at midnight, you're dead.""PERINO: It's not a bad thing if, when girls are younger, if their boyfriends think that her dad is going to kill you, that's not a bad thing, necessarily. That's a good thing.BECKEL: The truth is, I would have.PERINO: Right, good.BECKEL: Because he was a punk anyway.GUILFOYLE: All right, Bob.GUTFELD: I only have one rule for my body. And...GUILFOYLE: What?GUTFELD: I have a better message on a T-shirt. ""You make her cry, we make you cry."" That's all you need to have. The guy actually looks like he's in a pretty shape, so I don't think he needs a shirt to scare anybody. But I do get the feeling, like, ""feminist father"" sounds like the worst Halloween costume ever, and I do smell a little baloney here. I do feel like this is a perfect story that the liberal media would gobble up. But you know what? It's not bad.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I have no comment.GUILFOYLE: He should show his face.BECKEL: Is she showing these things?PERINO: I don't think so. I don't understand the rules.GUTFELD: I don't know. I just thought I needed a rule for my body.GUILFOYLE: Eric. Well -- Eric.BOLLING: I'm being very serious. Why is he a feminist by saying, ""My daughter can say no?"" I don't get that.PERINO: Right. Doesn't everybody say that?BECKEL: That's a...GUILFOYLE: Whose daughter can't?GUTFELD: Can't a boy wear that shirt? It's sexist if it's just for women.GUILFOYLE: Actually, under sharia law, that's not true.BECKEL: That's a feminist statement. I mean, I don't think this dude's a feminist, but that's a feminist statement.BOLLING: You can say no?GUTFELD: He looks like he works out. I don't think he needs that.BECKEL: He never had that when I was a lot younger. The girls would never say no.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh. I don't even know what to tell you about that. But anyway, I think you could turn around, show us who he is. Who is the man behind the shirt?But coming up, Bob hit some New York City bars over the weekend to see what the World Cup frenzy is all about.GUTFELD: Oh, goodness.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Beautiful game. It's the most popular sport in the world. You never know when the excitement is going to happen.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Do Bob's new friends help turn him from soccer critic into the sport's newest fan. We'll find out next on ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BECKEL: Let's start off with this very simple statement, OK? A man sport, wuss. OK. I'm not a big soccer fan, but a lot of people watched the World Cup this weekend. Twenty-four million viewers saw the USA and Portugal watch grass grow, a very exciting time.This weekend I decided to hit a local bar here in New York City to try to find out if these real-deal soccer fans really existed.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BECKEL: This is Bob Beckel with ""The Five,"" and I'm here at Legends Bar, the soccer institute of all New York City. About to start the next game, Germany versus Ghana. And you know what? I'm bored already. You guys like this game?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.BECKEL: Who you guys for in this game?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Germany.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Germany.BECKEL: I'm going to go watch the grass grow, and then I'll come back and then there will be a score.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Thank you very much.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bob, what's up? You're holding the wrong ball.BECKEL: Sure you don't want to do football?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's out the door. He's in the wrong bar.BECKEL: Who are you for?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She has no choice.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Germany.BECKEL: Excuse me, I'm sorry. We beat you in the war, you know.You're for Ghana?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm from Ghana, and I'm for Ghana.BECKEL: Last game I watched, it was 1-0. Took 90 minutes for one goal. Don't you find that boring?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a strategic game. The goals are just an added bonus.BECKEL: The one thing I thought about was you can go to the bathroom whenever you wanted to, because there's plenty of time between goals. I used to play American football. What is it about soccer -- this football that you like so much?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a beautiful game. It's the most popular sport in the world.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is what I like.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: National pride.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Excitement.BECKEL: You want to swap this? You want to play football?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is this?BECKEL: What is this?You're a fan of ""The Five,"" right?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely. Huge fan.BECKEL: What is it about this game?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I question the same thing about baseball.BECKEL: And you're for Ghana. Right?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm for Ghana, but I'm from Uganda.BECKEL: Why do you like it so much?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's the build-up. It's the teamwork. Can I show you how to use this thing?BECKEL: Go ahead.I've waited here. Football worldwide, football America. I'm sticking with football.Goaaaaal!(END VIDEOTAPE)GUILFOYLE: I see you got your ball back.BECKEL: Yes. It was -- it was an amazing experience to be in that bar. These people were really serious, A.B, they were packed in like sardines. Some of them hadn't discovered hygiene yet. And it was just -- that guy with that horn, he let that horn go right in my ear, and if I wasn't doing this for FOX, I'd have punched his lights out.But the -- the fact of the matter is, these people are serious. They love this game. And you know, I'd take that away from them. USA/Portugal game, I'm going to say, at the end was pretty interesting. In the middle it was really dull.BOLLING: So, here's the problem. I decided to watch U.S./Portugal at Dana's urging. I watched the whole game. And then, you know, somewhere around 20 or 30 minutes in or so, they stopped the game for a water break, because 89.6 degrees. They never had done that before, but they decided to do that.And then turns out, camera three points out that part of the reason why USA lost is the time they spent getting water was put onto the end of the game, and they scored, Portugal scored in the last 20 seconds of the game. This is so -- the rules are so stupid. Maybe if they fix the rules, Americans could get more involved in the game.BECKEL: Well, it's -- for the most part what they do is kick the ball back and forth to each other. It's like dodgeball.PERINO: The water -- OK, on the water -- on the water thing. We just had -- the White House just had a whole confab about concussions in football. We take our -- the safety of our athletes very seriously. The water thing is only if it's that hot. You're running basically a half a marathon with no water break.BECKEL: I don't have any problems with water break. Greg, I'm sure you watched the match.GUTFELD: I did.GUILFOYLE: But they called a time out and left the clock -- you know, stop the clock and then go.BECKEL: That's what they do.GUILFOYLE: But it's just so weird. It's like the schools I used to play in seventh grade. Like wait, how is there more time on the clock? Yes, it's not...BECKEL: It's arbitrary. So Greg, you did watch it, were you saying?GUTFELD: Yes, I was at a bar. It's amazing how people will clap for anything, because they're so starved for any kind of action. I saw half the bar was watching the game until they realized they were staring, actually, at a case of Mountain Dew.BOLLING: My wife spent most of the game googling Ronaldo and his life.BECKEL: Actually, there's something about that dude that a lot of women like him.PERINO: No. No, way too feminine. What is it? And his hair. I mean, you're going to have to cut that kind of stuff into your hair you've got ""low T"" problems.GUILFOYLE: I don't think he's got ""low T.""BECKEL: I wonder if everybody paid attention to the rules about not having sex for a month before the game.GUTFELD: Bob, by the way, I noticed your collar was up. You were infringing on Jesse Watters' territory.BECKEL: That's because it was a wuss jacket.GUILFOYLE: By the way, 18.2 million people watched it. That was the highest, most watched U.S. soccer game ever. How about Thursday.BECKEL: You know what happens tomorrow. Nobody but nobody.GUILFOYLE: Well, I'm all about Thursday.BECKEL: Watch USA/Germany game. Anyway, we'll beat the Germans the second time around -- third time around.GUILFOYLE: That was a good job, Bob.BECKEL: ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: ""One More Thing,"" I'll kick it off. Philanthropist billionaire, forest owner, great poet Felix Dennis passed away yesterday from canner. He was an amazing man. He was also my boss for a long time. Here he is on ""Red Eye,"" talking about it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Were you surprised to be on a show hosted by me?FELIX DENNIS, PHILANTHROPIST: I certainly am, seeing as I fired you three times, which you forgot to tell them.GUTFELD: You fired me from ""Maxim.""DENNIS: Yes.GUTFELD: You fired from ""Stuff."" What was the third firing?DENNIS: No. You got fired twice on ""Stuff."" Also you've been fired from other magazines that I didn't control for cruelty -- cruelty to animals, little furry pets, where he's having them juggled in the air. They fired him for juggling furry little animals.GUTFELD: It's so not true.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: To clarify I did not juggle. I was doing step aerobics on cats, and it was a joke. And I did get fired.Felix Dennis was a great man and a great philanthropist and he will be missed.All right. Dana.PERINO: All right. Well, I want to share my weekend with you, because it was Jasper's wet and wild weekend.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.PERINO: Let's look at the pictures. We were in Massachusetts with friends. This is Jasper in a hammock. How many dogs can do that?Let me tell you why I'm actually telling you this. Not just about the dog. So I was there with a friend of ours. They have three boys, ages 9, 6 and 3. It's Ryan, Benny and William. They played with my dog the whole weekend. But you know what was so refreshing? They did not play with electronics the whole weekend. They were outside the whole time.And I know that I just learned about this new toy, and I wanted to give it to Kimberly to redeem myself with Kimberly and her son. It's called a kaleidograph, and it's made right here in America. A new innovation with 500 billion designs that kids can do in a long car ride. And kids that like to build and design things love it. So I'm giving you these, Kimberly, for Ronan, for the long car rides.GUILFOYLE: Is this to make up for when you said you wouldn't take him?PERINO: Yes.BOLLING: He's going to be making...GUTFELD: Death stars.GUILFOYLE: Thank you, Dana.He's throwing them out the window on the 495. Very cool.BECKEL: Is he still up there?PERINO: No, I didn't leave Jasper up there. They would have kept him.GUILFOYLE: All right. Yes, I can get him off Minecraft. That would be good.Bob.BECKEL: All right.GUILFOYLE: I know your love life is going so swimmingly right now. But just in case you blow it, there's still hope, because Match.com is using facial recognition technology to help their users find the perfect mate.So what you do is you have to be a premium member and it actually costs, like, 5k. But if you have it, and you don't have time to go out there and be in the right bar at the right time and place, et cetera, like Bob at Legends, go ahead and do this. And you send pictures of, like, your exes so they see what kind of, like, shape faces that you like. And they go on pre-dates for you. They kind of test them out to make sure it's somebody you might be compatible with. And this really may be the way for you to help yourself.BECKEL: Yes. I would end up with the wicked witch of the west.GUTFELD: Bob, go.BECKEL: We had covered this story about Miriam Ibrahim, who is a Sudanese Christian who was sentenced to death because she refused to give up her Christianity, and her husband and her family, who are Christian. A judge released her, and I want to thank the judge for doing that. The first Muslim judge who has shown some courage.BOLLING: Very good.GUTFELD: Eric.BOLLING: Quickly, I fought with Porter all day. So I didn't have ""One More Thing."" I was being (UNINTELLIGIBLE) -- so instead I'll do this: EB2016 Snapcat. Listen, I want a story. I know my story. I want a Snapchat all. Can someone please call Snapchat and tell them to fix this problem?GUTFELD: All right.Don't forget to set your DVR so you never miss an episode of ""The Five.""
