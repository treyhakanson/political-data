This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  Do you think they should just do away with the superdelegates?  Because, if you look at pledged delegate, it's a lot closer race.  If you throw in the superdelegates, Hillary Clinton is just a couple of hundred away from closing this thing.  JANE SANDERS, WIFE OF BERNIE SANDERS:  Yes, it doesn't seem fair that superdelegates can play such an outsized role.  I mean, it's -- we learned in a democracy it's one person, one vote. Evidently not in the primary system.  So, we don't like the concept of the superdelegates.  It's pretty much an insurance policy for the establishment, that they can make sure that the primary doesn't good awry.  (END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  All right, to two ice cream guys who agree with Jane Sanders, wife of Bernie Sanders, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, co-founders, of course, of Ben & Jerry's, big Bernie Sanders supporters.Gentlemen, good to have both of you.What do you think, Ben, of what she is saying?  If not for these superdelegates -- and the math shows it -- it would be a lot closer race.  BEN COHEN, CO-FOUNDER, BEN & JERRY'S:  Absolutely correct.  And superdelegates are undemocratic.  The idea is to find a candidate that the people want.  And superdelegates go against the will of the people.  CAVUTO:  Jerry, the flip side of that, though, is that Hillary Clinton still leads by a few hundred delegates with pledged delegates.  So, this is a conundrum that the Sanders folks are raising.  You say what?  JERRY GREENFIELD, CO-FOUNDER, BEN & JERRY'S:  You know, I think, in terms of pledged delegates, it's about 55-45.  And the upcoming primaries are much more favorable to Bernie.And so by the time the convention comes, the difference in the pledged delegate is going to actually be closer, and by the time they go to the convention, neither candidates is going to have enough pledged candidates to win the nomination.  CAVUTO:  Well, we don't know.  You're right.  But we will see.Let me get your thoughts on how loyal you would be to Hillary Clinton if she ends up being the nominee?  I mentioned to Jane Sanders that a third of Sanders supporters were asked about this and said, well, you know what, we would have a tough time voting for Hillary.  Do you guys share that view?  COHEN:  We're of two minds.  (LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  I don't know what that means.  COHEN:  It would be a pretty difficult step for me to make.  And I am not positive what I would do, but I'm certainly not there at this time.  CAVUTO:  Jerry, what do you think of the idea of at least, if Hillary Clinton is the nominee, on her shirt list of potential running mates Bernie Sanders?  GREENFIELD:  Boy, I'm not that politically astute, but that doesn't strike me as something that's very likely at this point.  CAVUTO:  I know that.  But one of the things I was trying to get out of Jane Sanders, who was very diplomatic on this subject, well, we might look at her as a running mate, but the idea being that if -- when a short list is put out, as it was put out by some of the Hillary Clinton folks, and his name wasn't on it, you do have to wonder whether that appears rude to someone who has gotten a lot of passionate support, more than 10 million votes, routinely brings in $40 million to $50 million a month, usually 20, 30 bucks at a time.  What do you think?  GREENFIELD:  Well, let's be clear about one thing.  The decision has not been made yet about who is going to be the candidate.  We are going to go right until the convention.  every...CAVUTO:  I understand that.  I guess I'm taking the leap.  If it turned out that your guy doesn't get there, should he be considered as a running mate?  GREENFIELD:  Boy, that's kind of above my pay grade.  (LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  By the way, there are very few people above your pay grade, but I will entertain the thought.  But...GREENFIELD:  I don't -- I think what is important for Bernie is having everybody person have a chance to have their vote counted and going into the convention with a platform that really expresses what he has been talking about, whether it's a $15 minimum wage or health care for all or getting big money out of politics.  I think that's the big issue.  CAVUTO:  Yes.  COHEN:  You know, I think the interesting thing is that the primaries are not indicative of how a general election would go for Bernie, because all the independents are excluded from most of the primaries.  CAVUTO:  Well, certainly the big ones, minus the state he won where it was open to -- you're right about that.But then could I ask you, while you're on that thought, do you think, given the campaign, the way it is now, that it was a mistake on Sanders' part not to at least address the e-mail issue with Hillary Clinton or, for that matter, the Clinton Foundation, if for no other reason than to raise doubt and raise legitimate issues that those on the right and left has raising, but that he has not, that by not going there, he hurt himself in this race?COHEN:  I don't think it was a mistake.  Bernie has been clear from the outset that he wants this election to be about the substantive issues facing our country.CAVUTO:  But doesn't that cut to the core of who he says Hillary Clinton is, whether you buy that or not, that she -- whether it's a trust issue, or is she hooked up with rich and powerful, that -- is that enough?  COHEN:  He has not been wanting to run a campaign based on individual personalities.  He has been wanting to run a campaign based on principles and what policies our country should advance.CAVUTO:  OK.  COHEN:  And so, no, it was not a mistake for him not to talk about those things.  GREENFIELD:  And it's completely consistent with who he is as a person.CAVUTO:  No, no, no, you're right.  It is consistent with who he is.I just wonder, politically, if it kicked him in the heinie, you know?  GREENFIELD:  I think the fact that Bernie is authentic and genuine and honest is much more important than any single strategic issue here or there.  COHEN:  Well, I mean, the reality is that a guy who came out of nowhere in terms of the national picture is now tied for Hillary on national polls.  CAVUTO:  It's a valid point.  It's a very valid point.  COHEN:  And that's despite the fact that the entire Democratic establishment has been arrayed against him.CAVUTO:  OK.  COHEN:  And up until recently, there was a immediate blackout on him.  CAVUTO:  All right.  COHEN:  There's no doubt in my mind that if the media had devoted as much time to Bernie as they did to Trump, he would be way far ahead.  He would be leading right now.  CAVUTO:  Well, you should have sent them cartons of ice cream.  That could have solved it right there.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Guys, I want to thank you both very, very much.COHEN:  Ice cream only gets you so far.  CAVUTO:  Do not change Chunky Monkey.  That's all I'm saying.  Leave that alone.  Guys, very good having you.COHEN:  You can count on that.  That's my election year promise to you.  CAVUTO:  Excellent.  Wonderful.  Guys, thank you.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and she naps in an egg shell, Dana Perino, ""The Five.""Forget about the presidential debates, tonight is the debate that matters most. For these two guys are what's behind that glass we break in case of emergency.Who are they? Tim Pence and Mike Kaine.Sorry: Mike Pence and Tim Kaine. Or is it Mike Tim and Pence Kaine? Not that it matters: 4 out of 10 don't know them even though this is the ""heartbeat away"" crew.This guy or that guy. What do we know about them?They're white men, of course. In fact, they're so vanilla you're tempted to scoop them onto a slice of apple pie.One has a musical mouth:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(MUSIC PLAYING)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: And one has a dirty mouth.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, (R) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This (Bleep) really is fun to watch, I'll tell you what.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Neither were picked by the candidate: Hillary wanted her and Trump wanted him. Kaine and Pence: These mild extras from Allstate commercials were picked to calm a country worried about the other two. On a menu that only serves raw carp, Kaine and Pence are the chicken fingers.So the debate will be those two fellas defending their guy or gal. Kaine will say Hillary isn't corrupt; Pence will say Trump isn't nuts.They are the mousey spouses to their harsh partners. When their significant other is puking into a planter at a party, it's up to the Kaines and Pences of the world to say, ""He didn't mean that"" or ""Sorry, she's not feeling well."" Better halves are boring, but necessary.Last, these VPs are religious, so the presidential choice doesn't have to be. They secularized the campaign. So instead of debating over abortion or gay marriage, we've moved onto vital stuff, like sex tapes and overweight beauty queens.Glad we finally got to what matters.All right. So Dana...DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Yeah.GUTFELD: There's only one debate for the VP candidates. Is that one too many?PERINO: I think that one is just plenty.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: One is just plenty. I think it's good. It's interesting that these two -- you know, vice presidents are usually the attack dogs.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: But they don't need to be in this case, as you're pointing out. They just need to be the calmer one. For both Cheney and Biden, those choices I think really were meant to help counterbalance and show some gravitas, but they were also really good attack dogs.Cheney in particular I think was very good at it in the debate and especially when it came to John Edwards in that debate which really helped George W. Bush because as Eric was pointing out yesterday, the person who usually wins the first debate isn't all -- look, 75 percent historically, they don't end up being the president.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Oh, you are in so much trouble on twitter now.PERINO: Why? I've said that from the beginning.BOLLING: Because they know. I know that Twitter just lights up. Oh, I can't believe you said that.PERINO: I don't care about Twitter.BOLLING: I think you're in the tank for this one. You're out of your mind. Don't you know this was leaving before you went in? I've never opened up more cans of -- a bigger can of worms than that.GUFELD: Twitter worms.BOLLING: Yes. I'm sorry.PERINO: OK, so my point was going to be that 43 was largely seen to have lost that first debate in the re-election and he gets off stage and he thinks he's done just fine and the staff is like, oh, sir, that was not a good debate. He's like, what are you talking about? He goes down in the polls and John Kerry -- that race was very close -- John Kerry starts doing better.What really helps stop the slide in the polls was Cheney's debate against Edwards because he destroyed him and that actually stopped the slide and then he was able to get his way back.GUTFELD: All right. All right. Eric, you somehow made this interesting. What am I going to do tonight?BOLLING: But...GUTFELD: Go ahead.BOLING: It's almost like Trump and Hillary are pizza and chicken wings.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: And these two are the veggies.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: They got to have that. No matter who you end up voting for, you want to make sure that they have some stability across and you're comfortable, as you point out, one heartbeat away from the presidency. With both of them, I think they're both going to be very measured about probably trying to engage the other one in bringing the top of the ticket into the debate and they'll both probably push back on that and say -- certainly what I would do is stay with us.PERINO: I think it's going to get fiery and I think that abortion and gay marriage absolutely will come up tonight.GUTFELD: That's what I was going to ask Juan because you notice no social issues between when they have Trump and Hillary -- totally didn't want to debate though. But because he's religious and one of them is modified -- Kaine has modified his beliefs to fit the party, which is kind of hypocritical. Pence is still anti-gay marriage. This could be...JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Right. And Pence, of course, had the religious freedom deal in Indiana that was essentially canceled out by the large corporations in Indiana which said this is an opposition to our, you know, gay rights agenda and you can't do that. But the abortion issue has not come up and later in the show we're going to talk about Obamacare. Obamacare hasn't come up.I imagine that also Pence is going to have to defend the wall and defend Trump on immigration even though Pence has not been a supporter of what Donald Trump has put forward on immigration like banning Muslims from coming into the country. To my mind, what is so interesting about this is these are the party regulars. Kaine actually was the head of the Democratic National Committee and a tremendous fund-raiser. Pence is a guy that's loved -- beloved by the Republican establishment, especially evangelicals.I think for them, he will be the guy that could excite them that could get them going and support Trump. Right now they're just kind of like, yeah, I guess we got to go with Trump because we don't like Hillary. But he could actually excite some fires.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah, I think he's got you know, a couple of important jobs to get done tonight -- Pence does. I think, yes, he's got to perhaps excite or motivate the base but also some reassurance to say, look, I'm with this guy. I'm with Trump. For those of you out there that, you know, trust me.Trust the type of politics, the ideology that I bring forward -- conservatism, a focus on religion and first amendment and whatnot. You can trust me and also the guy that I'm with isn't somebody who is a misogynist or has issues with women. I think he's going to try to do some of that to kind of coat the ticket and acceptability.GUTFELD: Right.GUIFOYLE: And then in terms of Kaine, I think he's going to say, listen, I promise you, I pinky swear that Hillary is not going to put up a for sale sign up on the Oval when she gets in and influence peddling and that you can trust her. So I think that's a little bit of what they need to get done.PERINO: Can add one other thing about the importance of this debate?GUTFELD: One more thing?PERINO: Well, not to the (inaudible), but I do think given the fact that the senate races are so close right now, it does look like the Republicans are going to be able to hold on but there's a scenario, a very real one that you could have a 50/50 senate which means that one of this two people would be the vice president of the United States and that position becomes so much more important in any scenario where there's a deadlock in the Congress.BOLLING: So, can I ask a very, very legitimate question that I don't know the answer? Is this a debate to find out who these two are or is this a debate to find out how these people support their candidate? How do they support -- I don't know. I mean, I guess it's going to come down to the debate moderator to decide which way to go after because I would rather know what Kaine and Pence are about rather than how Pence is going to defend some of the things that he doesn't agree with Donald Trump on and how Kaine will defend some of the things he disagrees with Hillary Clinton on.GUTFELD: I think that's what going to cancel -- I have a feeling there's going to be a canceling out because of that. I think Trump is coming out.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Of your ear?GUTFELD: He's coming out of my ear. It's a weird disorder. All right, I have -- what do you think will come up then? Speaking of coming up...GUILFOYLE: Yes, exactly. Coming up, the debate. I think it's actually going to be exciting to watch. I think people have this kind of weird low expectation of it and I think that's the wrong way to go. I think it's going to be fiery and I think that they've got to prove themselves here and try to do the best that they can especially I think Pence has to try to pick up some steam and some momentum that people felt that Donald Trump should have been able to get from the last debate and kind of make up...PERINO: And one of the ways that he can do that is to try to hit some of the missed opportunities that we talked about with Donald Trump in terms of the Foundation, the e-mails, et cetera. And also I think Pence has a little bit of an interesting walk but I think he stands to benefit from the fact that Donald Trump is the outsider candidate. He's the out party candidate so how do you as Mike Pence was an insider but then left and was governor, what do you know how to fix Washington, he'll be able to say that.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, joining the ticket of change.GUTFELD: I just hope that Kaine brings his harmonica.WILLIAMS: Yeah, I tell you what. I think both of them are basically this is like the guy who's the street sweeper after the circus. They have to clean up the mess and in the case of Kaine, he's got to humanize Hillary Clinton. Get back to what the Democratic Convention did. And in the case of Mike Pence, I think he's got to explain birthers, racism, bigotry, anti-Muslim stuff.GUTFELD: But the other thing is, 40 percent of the electorate can't name either candidate.PERINO: Well, that's true that 40 -- I don't think that if you do those tests like, how many people can name the current vice president.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: And you get but a similar percentage.GUTFELD: The current vice president can't name the current vice president.PERINO: No.GUTFELD: That's a joke. I love Joe Biden. That is our current vice president. Looks like we've got Donald Trump speaking. That's exciting.PERINO: Are you tossing to?GUTFELD: Yeah, I don't think I'm going to toss to -- I don't think I'm tossing to it. I think we're just going to stare at it. Isn't it interesting though this is the first real election where there's not real social issues.GUILFOYLE: Well, then it's come up, yes. But that doesn't mean it won't come up at the next presidential debate or perhaps a preview of it on the debate tonight with the vice president.PERINO: It will definitely come up especially as something that Hillary Clinton did not do, which she did not try even though she was narrowcasting to particular constituencies that would support her. She didn't talk specifically about gay issues or about abortion and I definitely think that Kaine is going to bring that up.He will say that Mike Pence was the one who wanted to defund Planned Parenthood and then he will talk about the gay rights issues in Indiana. Conversely, I think that Pence will say that Kaine is a hypocrite for not being truly pro life.BOLLING: And Dana, how much -- not how much relevance -- how much impact is that going to have on the election given...PERINO: Hard to say.BOLLING: ...that they're just the VP, you know...PERINO: I think the only way that this actually moves the needle at all is that one of them spectacularly fails, which I don't anticipate either of them doing.WILLIAMS: But I think that you have an opportunity for, you know, but for Kaine to say, hey, what about your differences with your candidate? Not only is it you have differences about allowing Muslim immigrants into the country, he also disagrees with him about climate change. A lot of this stuff is going to be the Republican establishment figure versus Donald Trump. If Kaine is successful, he's going to bore (ph) in there and say, hey, there's a real difference between you and the candidate. Help us understand this.GUTFELD: All right, we got -- he's talking about the debate, let's go to Mr. Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The debate will be a contrast between our campaign of big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow versus the small and petty Clinton campaign that is totally stuck in the past. Totally stuck in the past. We are change. She is for four more years of Obama and we can't take that.(BOOING)Clinton can't talk about real problems facing our country because she's the one who helped create all of those problems in the first place. They are not going to be able to do anything about it. To hide her corruption, she deleted 33,000 e-mails after getting a congressional subpoena.(BOOING)Wow. How she got away with that one.(CHEERING)How she got away with that is a disgrace.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: All right. We're going to continue monitoring this to see if he breaks any news about the debate. It's very exciting. Meanwhile, Bret Baier joins us from the debate side with more on the showdown. Also ahead, Category Four Hurricane Matthew is pounding Haiti. The East Coast is on high alert. South Carolina's governor has ordered a coastal evacuation in preparation for the storm. A live update from the Fox Weather Center ahead.(COMERCIAL BREAK)RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST: I'm meteorologist Rick Reichmth from the Fox Weather Center. This right here is the center of Hurricane Matthew, a category four storm getting ready to move over the far eastern tip of Cuba. Unfortunately, not interacting with a lot of land, that means no weakening as it tracks here to the Bahamas. This is the future forecast for this and you get the idea over the next two days.It's going to rake the Bahamas, still maintaining category three or four strength. So, a major hurricane moving across the Bahamas and the latest advisory at 5:00 p.m. just came in and it's now extended the hurricane watch down just to the north of Miami. Expecting to see kind of a western trend with the latest model runs and that means that the track nudges a little bit farther off towards the west. We have the potential to have the center of this storm moving anywhere here right along the coastal areas of Florida before moving somewhere across the Carolinas.After that, lots of uncertainty late in the forecast in the short term Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and the North Carolina need to watch this storm very closely. We'll keep you up to date right here on Fox News. Right now, we'll sed it back to ""The Five.""WILLIAMS: Tonight on the Fox News Channel, you will see the first and the last debate between the vice presidential nominees Mike Pence and Tim Kaine. It begins in less than four hours, 9:00 p.m. eastern. Joining us now, a man who knows a thing or two about what to expect the debates right there, who co-moderated three of them this election cycle. That's the chief political anchor and he's at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. He's the anchor of ""Special Report,"" but you knew that. Hi, Bret.BRET BAIER, CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR: Hi, Juan.WILLIAMS: I had a, you know, I was thinking, we were all here pumping up the audience to say you've got to watch tonight. We had a record audience for the presidential debate last week, and what I know historically is the two biggest vice presidential debates in terms of audience, Bush v. Ferraro in '84, about 56 million, and of course in '08 Biden versus Palin, 69 million.What do you think about tonight? Those two you'll note had women in it. They were the first -- the first one was obviously Ferraro, but then also Palin. The women brought something special. Tonight, as my friend Greg Gutfeld said, we've got two white guys. What do you think?BAIER: Well, I tell you, this is not the best tease but I think both of these guys are probably going to try to not make news tonight. To try to, you know, get through, defend the top of the ticket, well-positioned about -- Mike Pence will talk about change and that fact that he and Donald Trump are the change agents here. You just heard Donald Trump in that appearance that he was wishing Mike Pence good luck and saying that they are the change.And that Hillary Clinton is President Obama four more years and we can't take that. So I think that message will come through from Pence. And then Kaine will try to stick Pence with the temperament issues 3:00 a.m. tweets that you hear from Hillary Clinton.WILLIAMS: Eric Bolling.BOLLING: Hey Bret, so this isn't Farmville, Virginia, notably that the governor Kaine from Virginia, he'll be the home team player there. How does the moderator make sure that the crowd doesn't get involved in how more the debate in favor of Kaine?BAIER: Yeah, so they do the whole preamble where the commission comes out and admonishes the crowd to really stay out of this. I will say that last time being in the hall, the crowd at the last debate did not towards the end. I mean, they were very kind of loud and laughing and clapping and weighing in. Elaine Quijano with CBS will likely lay down those same guidelines for this audience. There are about 600 seats in that hall and 100 of them will be students, the others will be broken up to the two campaign.WILLIAMS: Kimberly Guilfoyle?GUILFOYLE: Hi, Bret. So, I'm actually looking forward to this tonight. I think they both going to do a very good job and represent their party and also their running mates well. If you were to pick one area in particular that you think might be a big focus tonight, what would it be?BAIER: I think they are going to both go after the top of the ticket, as I mentioned, and try to stick, you know, Kaine will be on the defense about the e-mail servers and the immunity deals one would think. Pence will be armed with that. And then Mike Pence will be, you know, probably on the defensive but have largely done a pretty good job of explaining Donald Trump and his appeal to middle America.I think on substance though, Kimberly, that some of these social issues -- I think I heard Dana mentioning them earlier, they make them up because obviously Mike Pence as Indiana governor dealt with that Religious Freedom Bill and I bet Tim Kaine goes after that. Tim Kaine has his own defense about the Hyde amendment and abortion.WILLIAMS: Dana?PERINO: Well, I'm curious Bret. I know that you've just said that you think that their goal is to make no news, but if you were one of these campaigns and you thought that maybe you could use a little bump, I mean, maybe they should try to make some news tonight. Donald Trump just said he's going to live tweet the debate, which actually might be the most interesting part of the debate. But wouldn't one of these campaigns want a big headline tomorrow morning?BAIER: As long as it's the right headline as you know, Dana. I mean, if it's going your way and there's a moment, you know, a Lloyd Benson moment to Dan Quayle, that you are no Jack Kennedy, yes, that would be great. But if they -- one of them steps in it, you don't want that to be the headline to take away from the top of the ticket. I don't think, if you look back at vice presidential debates, that they have moved the needles that much.Can you think of more than just a couple of moments that from vice presidential debates? I don't think many people can so, we'll see what happens. It could potentially be more substantive on policy. These guys are well-versed in their two parties.WILLIAMS: Greg Gutfeld has a question about Tim Kaine's eyebrows.GUTFELD: Do I? You read my mind, you sexy beast. You know, people think that this is going to be the opposite of the presidential debate. The debate was -- presidential debate was high expectation for drama, low expectation for substance. And somehow we think this is going to be reversed.I have a feeling this could get ugly because they're going to have to defend each other's choices, the choices they may not have made, but their partner. It is like, you know, you're married to an obnoxious spouse that you have to constantly defend.BAIER: OK.GUTFELD: I'm just saying, I think to my wife's perspective.GUIFOYLE: Yeah.BAIER: Well OK, all right. I got it. I will say this, you know, like the practice partners for these two governors, Scott Walker of Wisconsin is playing the role of Tim Kaine for Mike Pence and Bob Barnett, Washington lawyer, is playing the role of Mike Pence for Tim Kaine. Those are not, you know -- I don't think they are going to upset the apple cart there with those practice partners, but I do think that you may be right because last night, we had a sound bite from Governor Pence and we had to bleep it when he said, can you believe this blank about...WILLIAMS: We heard that. We heard that earlier. Yeah, Dana has a quick follow-up for you.PERINO: Bret, I wanted to ask you this because in the presidential debate and actually throughout the campaign, neither of them have talked much about Obamacare but I actually still believe that the reason that the Republicans won in 2014 are the reasons that the Republicans should continue to talk about Obamacare, especially now. How do you think both of them handle that tonight?BAIER: It's going to be a huge thing I think tonight and bet you -- we hear about that sound bite from former President Bill Clinton where he says Obamacare is just crazy. The people, small businesses are getting killed. I would venture to guess that Governor Pence is probably going to quote from that and Obamacare is going to be a factor in one of these -- whether it's brought up by the moderator, Elaine Quijano or brought up by Mike Pence, because it is a big issue as you go around these states and talk to people. They are affected by it, Dana.PERINO: And it's not necessarily that easy for Mike Pence in terms of, you know, totally trashing Obamacare because as governor of Indiana, he went ahead and took the deal that Obamacare offered to the state.BAIER: Exactly. So you know, I think Kaine will come back with, you know, they want to repeal and replace but replace with what and Republicans have been blocking. You saw president Obama wrote an op-ed in the Huffington Post.WILLIAM: We have to do break in here. Hillary Clinton has come to the microphone for press availability. Here she is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Campaign developments in the last day. Yesterday, Donald Trump was asked a question about post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injury and other challenges facing many of our troops. And part of his response was that post-traumatic stress happens to troops who, quote, ""can't handle it."" He said if you're strong, you can handle it. Many people are now standing up and speaking out against Trump because post traumatic stress is not something that strong people can handle and we (inaudible).Some of the strongest men and women any of us will ever meet have experienced post-traumatic stress. Donald Trump's comments are not just ignorant, they are harmful because they give voice to the stigmas that has led generations of veterans to hide their struggles instead of getting life-saving help. That stigma still exists and lots of people who need help aren't getting it. You know what doesn't help with that? When a man asking to be our next commander-in-chief stands up and says post-traumatic stress isn't a problem if you're strong.Vice President Joe Biden spoke about this in an interview earlier today and he said that every morning he gets an update from the Pentagon on how many troops were injured or killed around the world overnight. We learned earlier today that an American service member was killed by an IED in Afghanistan. Every one of our troops matter. Their wounds can be visible and invisible. Most of us know that but apparently Donald doesn't. Our troops deserve a commander-in-chief who understands and respects the sacrifices they make.Whether they're living with posttraumatic stress or they're POW's or they don't make it home and they leave a grieving family behind. And every American dealing with mental health challenges deserves compassion whether they've ever served in uniform or not. So, I hope the voters are hearing Donald Trump loudly and clearly. Now, I want to thank our service members, our veterans and all of our military families for their service and sacrifice.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: That was Hillary Clinton talking about Donald Trump's comments on post-traumatic stress syndrome and its effect on the troops yesterday. Obviously, very critical.Up next, President Clinton didn't have very good things to say about Obamacare yesterday but it appears he's trying today to undo the damage. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's President Obama's signature law, one that Hillary Clinton has pledged to expand. So why hasn't the Democratic nominee been touting Obamacare more on the trail? The secretary has gone pretty silent on the Affordable Care Act, but she was asked about health care at an event today and brought up some of Obamacare's shortcomings.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Obviously I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that everyone has quality, affordable health care, and that means we've got to fix the Affordable Care Act, keep what works about it but improve it, get the costs down. Premiums and deductibles, prescription drug costs are way too high. So we've got to work on that.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Her husband, Bill, went even further yesterday. He didn't have a lot of great things to say about the legislation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To people who are getting killed in this deal or small business people and individuals who made just a little bit too much to get any of these subsidies, they are getting whacked. So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care, and then the people that are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: After that generated a lot of headlines, the former president offered a much more positive assessment today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)B. CLINTON: Look, the affordable health care act did a world of good, and the 50 something efforts to repeal it that the Republicans have staged were a terrible mistake. We, for the first time in our history, at least, are providing insurance to more than 90 percent of our people.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Eric, that first sound bite is, I think, why a lot of Republicans were like, it wasn't that bad. I mean, he actually kind of gets the joke.BOLLING: How -- how do you go from ""it's a crazy system,"" literally his words -- he said ""crazy"" -- Obamacare is a crazy system -- to ""it's done a world of good""? It's cleaning up your own mess. Hillary tried to clean up the mess, as well.I'll tell you where it's not going over pretty well, I'm guessing, is in Brooklyn at head -- campaign headquarters, going, ""Can we just get this guy off the stage?""PERINO: Not just there. In Washington, D.C.BOLLING: And in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as well. I agree. Keep him off the stage. Now you have Obama campaigning for Hillary and Michelle Obama, also campaigning. They're doing a good job. Keep Bill off the stage. If I were them, I'd say, ""Hey, Bill, it's time to take a little break.""GUTFELD: You know, they can keep bill busy.But anyway, it's true. Keep him off the stage.The worst part of politics is when they know something is wrong, but they push it through anyway, which is ideology. Ideology trumps factual research or just commonsense.Government intrusion is the left-wing equivalent of military intrusion. They never think of the next step. They just say, ""This is good and the consequences will work themselves out.""So like Obama didn't think this thing through. He didn't have to, because the media absolved their responsibility in being the engine of criticism. Because it's a progressive idea. If you have a progressive idea, the media will say, ""You know what? We don't care about the consequences. Go for it."" So government intrusion has absolutely no emergency brake; and it gets worse and worse.PERINO: And if you look at the states and what is happening, actually, there, including places like Minnesota, which was at risk last week, Juan, of basically having no individual market until they had some emergency step-in, some people think that the death spiral has already begun. And so President Obama tomorrow is going to give a speech trying to defend Obamacare, because it is his legacy; and yet, it's not going well, but she wants to make it even bigger.WILLIAMS: Well, I think it is going well. So let me just say I disagree with you. I think, in fact, the idea that you have 20 million people covered for health care who previously had no insurance is a big step forward.And you stop and think about a lot of things. This is kind of a mirror image of what Greg was saying. You stop and think about the political ideology blocks that have been put in place, and you realize that President Obama, Hillary Clinton and now Bill Clinton have all said, yes, there are steps that need to be taken.PERINO: Juan, Hillary Clinton is talking about this very issue right now.GUTFELD: Hillary's more important.PERINO: We'll listen to her.H. CLINTON: ... viewers really understand. What that means is not just that the 20, 21 million people on the exchanges would lose their coverage. If you repeal the Affordable Care Act, that means every American who is insured through your employer will all of a sudden go back to the days when insurance companies could deny you health care because of preexisting conditions, where you would have lifetime limits, where young people would not be able to afford coverage, whereas now they can stay on their parents' policies until the age of 26. All that and more is part of the Affordable Care Act.So this is a really big deal, because it affects, you know, about 195 million to 200 million Americans. And so people need to really pay attention when Trump says he's going to get rid of it and turn it back to the insurance companies.And then one of the strangest things he has said -- and there's a long litany of those -- but one of them is how he wants to let insurance companies sell across state lines. In fact, he told an interview about a year ago, ""Hey, I don't care if China sells us our insurance policies."" I mean, imagine getting approval for your drug by calling Beijing. I mean, there is just so much that he doesn't either understand or care about.So yes, we're going to -- we're going to tackle it. We're going to fix it. And it won't be easy, but it's a heck of a lot better than starting from scratch, which is what, unfortunately, the Republicans want us to do.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (UNINTELLIGIBLE)CLINTON: I think he made it clear what he was saying.Hi.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: About preparing for...PERINO: You're listening to Hillary Clinton, who was answering questions on the very topic that we were just talking about. Kimberly, your thoughts on her answer?GUILFOYLE: Yes, you know, I think what's interesting here is she kind of was having to clean up a little bit aisle seven, because you know, Bill went out and spoke the truth; and then he had to walk it back, because obviously, they're saying, ""Look, we're trying to help you win the presidency, and you're doing something that's basically disparaging one of the greatest legacies that President Obama likes to think,"" which I see Juan has ACA, Affordable Care Act down, not Obamacare. I noticed that.So they're trying to say, ""Listen, we don't want to make a problem."" Because that's -- her husband, the stuff that he says affects her, affect people's opinion and the voters out there listening. So he wanted to kind of put that out there a little bit to put some criticism, and then she has to say, ""OK, but it's OK, and it was one of the greatest accomplishments"" and he backs her up.PERINO: So he made the accidental mistake of telling the truth. And here we are.Ahead, Leonardo DiCaprio and President Obama have some strong words for those who don't believe in climate change. They spoke together at the White House yesterday. You'll hear from them next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Hollywood eco-warrior Leo DiCaprio sounding the alarm again about global warming, this time with a new documentary called ""Before the Flood."" While DiCaprio's crisscrossing the planet, trying to save the world, we should remind you, he's not traveling in a solar-powered vehicle but on carbon-polluting private planes and luxury yachts.DiCaprio screened the film for President Obama at the White House yesterday and delivered this warning to anyone who doesn't buy into global warming.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LEONARDO DICAPRIO, ACTOR: The scientific consensus is in, and the argument is now over. If you do not believe in climate change, you do not believe in facts or in science or empirical truth and, therefore, in my humble opinion, should not be allowed to hold public office.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And then, of course, the climate alarmist in chief chimed in.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have members of Congress who scoff at climate change at the same time that they are saluting and wearing flag pins and extolling their patriotism. That change our politics. And as Leo said, it's got to come from the bottom up.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Look, I'm not a climate denier. I just need to see proof that, A, we're causing temperatures, man is causing temperatures to rise and, B, this poses dire risks to humanity before we spend trillions trying to fix a problem we don't fully comprehend. That's just me. We'll bring it around quickly -- Greg.GUTFELD: It's true. It comes from the bottom up, because he is an ass.All right. What he just said...GUILFOYLE: Charming.GUTFELD: ... violates the first rule of science. When you say science is settled, the entire scientific method is being based -- is based on being proven wrong. Every scientist welcomes a challenge. You have to wonder about a belief system that doesn't want any challenges, that doesn't want any of their theories to be questioned. This -- what he is talking about is radical Islam of science. He is actually turning science into a religion.However, on the other side, do not call it a hoax, because you play into their beliefs. Demand evidence, demand evidence. Climate change has existed since the big bang.BOLLING: OK, Dana. In his humble opinion.PERINO: Nothing humble about that opinion that they gave. But I truly believe this issue comes up in the vice-presidential debate tonight, because millennials care about this issue very much. We've read all week about the trouble that the Hillary Clinton campaign has with young voters. So I think Tim Kaine will find a way to bring it up if the moderator does not.BOLLING: Mr. Juan.WILLIAMS: This is interesting. I like what Dana said, because guess what? Mike Pence, the vice-presidential nominee of the Republican Party, disagrees with Donald Trump. He thinks human beings are involved with climate change, and it's real. So I'm very interested to see how he would have to handle this.PERINO: Ms. K.G.GUILFOYLE: So obviously, this is something that is timely and could be brought up tonight to try to show the differences and drive a wedge between that ticket. But I just want to know if all these people that are complaining about climate change, are they going to sign a nice petition to say that they will, in fact, pledge not to fly around on their private jets?BOLLING: All right.GUTFELD: I would never do that.BOLLING: We'll leave it right there.GUILFOYLE: This is a big deal.BOLLING: Directly ahead, after all the hype, did WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange deliver on his promise to drop an October surprise about Hillary Clinton today? The answer next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Welcome back to ""The Five."" WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange has been pledging for a while to release more damaging documents on Hillary Clinton. But this morning there wasn't the October surprise many were anticipating.Clinton was asked about Assange moments ago.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Julian Assange this morning said he plans to release documents in the next three, five days that could affect the U.S. election. Are you worried that there's anything that could come out that would upend the race? And related to that, there's a report going around that you joked once about Assange, ""Can't we just drone the guy?"" Did you ever joke about droning Assange?H. CLINTON: I don't know anything about what he's talking about, and I don't recall any joke. It would have been a joke if it had been said, but I don't recall that.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Not a flat-out denial. Kind of interesting that she said that. When you heard it, Bolling, I saw you turned your head.BOLLING: Yes. No, I thought it was -- didn't -- it was quoted. Her saying, ""Can't we just drone this guy,"" right?GUILFOYLE: Yes, but she said...BOLLING: She doesn't recall saying it?GUILFOYLE: ... she doesn't remember saying it. It was a joke.PERINO: I don't know. I've not seen that actually -- reported that maybe she said that.BOLLING: Right. We may need context on it. It may be part of a funny dialogue back and forth. But still, I mean, I think she said it. Right? It's been printed.GUTFELD: But you know what? This kind of isn't what the topic was about. It was about what he did. He pulled the chain of all right wingers, while Alex Jones just loses skin over this thing, because Assange is a self- promoting clown who played everyone.He doesn't like America. His whole endeavor is to subvert our country. That's how he got famous. It's not about what Hillary said. And hell, I don't disagree if she did say it.WILLIAMS: Yes, but you know what's funny is, boy, you know, you hate...PERINO: Whoa.WILLIAMS: ... to see people just get...GUILFOYLE: How hawkish of you.WILLIAMS: ... played like this. Because this was three-card monte on the political right.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Saying, ""Hey, you know what? He didn't do well in the debate. He's having trouble with Twitter. But Julian Assange is really going to get her."" And you had people like Roger Stone, right, tweeting...GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: ... ""Oh, Wednesday, that's the end of Hillary."" Well...PERINO: There's still 12 more hours.GUILFOYLE: Always a voice of reason, Dana Perino.BOLLING: There's 35 more days.WILLIAMS: Thirty-five more days. You're still hoping.BOLLING: No, I'm not hoping for anything.GUILFOYLE: So what happened here? Why say that and...GUTFELD: She's, like, the Easter bunny.PERINO: He's a self-promoter.I saw Kennedy in the elevator bay. And she said that she set her alarm for 3:30 in the morning, got up and sat and watched that. And...BOLLING: Oh, no.GUTFELD: Aww.GUILFOYLE: And then she went for...GUTFELD: Did she make chocolate chip cookies and put it on the table with a glass of milk?PERINO: She probably ran ten miles across the bridge and back, and then came here, did three shows.GUILFOYLE: She did 7 minute -- 7 miles in 54 minutes, her quickest time. It's a fact.GUTFELD: Wow.GUILFOYLE: ""One More Thing"" up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: ""One More Thing"" -- Eric.BOLLING: OK. Earlier today I was walking up 5th Avenue. I bumped into -- drumroll, please -- anchor of ""Good Morning America,"" George Stephanopoulos. It was very cordial. We shook hands.But as I walked away, I was reminded of a gripping documentary Adrienne and I saw recently, ""The War Room,"" about the 1992 election. It vividly illustrates the lengths Carville, Clinton, and his communications director at the time, George Stephanopoulos, went to to suppress the outrage stemming from some of Bill's most scandalous pastimes.Stephanopoulos was the Clinton hit man who unapologetically covered up sex scandal after sex scandal.It also reminded me of the time Hillary told Stephanopoulos they need to, quote, ""destroy her story,"" referring to one of Bill's sexual advances.Anyway, always good running into George on the street.Also, I want to wish my awesome wife, Adrienne, a very happy 19th anniversary. Super mom, super wife, 19 years with me. She has to be a saint.GUILFOYLE: Agree. Happy anniversary.GUTFELD: You said all of that to George on the street?BOLLING: No, no. I said hello and shook his hand.GUTFELD: OK. Just wanted to make clear.PERINO: He trashed him now.GUTFELD: Yes, you wait till now.GUILFOYLE: Dana had 18-year anniversary and Bolling 19 years. Congratulations.PERINO: Thank you.BOLLING: Thank you.GUTFELD: Greg's Nutrition Tips.All right. If you own a Shar Pei, don't feed him strawberries. Take a look at this poor soul. This dog was fed a strawberry and has yet to -- this has been filmed -- been able to eat it because it just can't get it into his mouth.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(SHAR PEI TRYING TO EAT A STRAWBERRY)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Why?GUTFELD: Look at this. Isn't this amazing?GUILFOYLE: But why?GUTFELD: Because he's...BOLLING: You're not supposed to give dogs strawberries, anyway.PERINO: No, you're probably not. Certainly not grapes.GUILFOYLE: Well, you can't give them chocolate or raisins.PERINO: Or blueberries.GUTFELD: All right. Dana.PERINO: OK. So this is fun. If you need something to talk about with your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, whatever...GUTFELD: Why do you have to use those terms?PERINO: ... you have to check out Megan McArdle's column on Bloomberg. We're going to have it on our Facebook page. It's called ""The Economics of Dining as a Couple. And you can go through, it talks about the different ways through economics -- if your kids are studying economics, have them go through this -- such as do you each order something separately? So that would be autarky. Do you have individual production with trade. So, like, Kimberly orders something and her boyfriend orders something -- we're not naming anybody -- and then they maybe trade something. I just didn't want people to think...GUTFELD: This is dense.PERINO: We don't have a -- we don't have a boyfriend to talk about at the moment, I don't think. Are we talking about one?WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.GUTFELD: Oh, wow.PERINO: I lost track. This is a really good article.WILLIAMS: All right.PERINO: Sorry, Kimberly.WILLIAMS: Bien Stiller had a surprise announcement on ""The Howard Stern Show"" earlier today. He said he was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer two years ago at very young age, 46, and had the radical surgery to remove his entire prostate gland.He's healthy now and telling his story to raise awareness for young men of the dangers of not paying attention.This November, for me, marks seven years since, in my early 50s, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had the very same surgery. And I just want to double down on Ben's message, how important it is for Scandinavian and African-American men to know about prostate cancer.GUILFOYLE: Thanks.I just want to say happy birthday to my son, Ronan. He's 10 today.BOLLING: Yay.GUILFOYLE: We have some pictures of him. Real quick if we could show.PERINO: So cute. And he's 10. That's a big deal.GUTFELD: Yes. That's huge.PERINO: And you've done a good job, Mama.GUTFELD: He's into his second decade.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

King talk Trump's KKK controversy; Carson vows he's not dropping out of race	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" February 29, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight. Just hours away from the most consequential day of this election thus far and Republican front-runner Donald Trump is in the middle of an ugly new controversy.Good evening, and welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly.  Tomorrow morning, Super Tuesday, five Republican contenders are on the ballot in nearly a dozen states. Five hundred and ninety five delegates are at stake. That's nearly half the number needed to clinch the GOP nomination for president. And dominating the headlines today, Donald Trump and his refusal on Sunday to condemn the Ku Klux Klan. It started last week when former Klan grand wizard and White supremacist David Duke said, he supported Trump's candidacy.At first, Mr. Trump disavowed Dave Duke's support but then yesterday Trump was asked about it again on CNN, and this time he declined to condemn Duke claiming he didn't know who David Duke was. In moments, we will be joined on this by former republican presidential candidate, Governor Mike Huckabee, and Republican New York Congressman Peter King.But we begin tonight with Trace Gallagher who has the very latest. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And Megyn, to be clear, David Duke has not endorsed Donald Trump but on his radio show Duke did say that supporting someone other than Trump is, quote, ""really treason to your heritage."" For those unfamiliar with Duke, not only is he the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, he was also a one term Republican state representative in Louisiana, has unsuccessfully run for U.S. Congress, the U.S. Senate, and has three times run for president as a Democrat, a Republican, and a member of the reform party. In fact, in 2000, Donald Trump refused to run for president as a reform party candidate because at the time Trump said, quoting here, ""The Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a communist, Miss Fulani.  This is not company I wish to keep."" And yet, when Donald Trump was asked three times by CNN about getting David Duke support, he said this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAKE TAPPER, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say you don't want his vote or that of other White supremacists in this election?DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke, OK?TAPPER: Would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don't want their support?TRUMP: Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about.  TAPPER: I'm just talking about David Duke on the Ku Klux Klan here but --  TRUMP: Honestly, I don't know David Duke.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Well, now Trump claims he had trouble hearing the questions because he had a faulty earpiece. But listen again to part of the interview. It appears Trump hears the entire question because he uses the same words during the answer. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say you don't want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election?TRUMP: Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with White supremacy or White supremacists. So I don't know.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Many are also wondering why not disavow David Duke on Sunday when Trump had no problem disavowing him two days earlier? Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How do you feel about the recent endorsement from David Duke?TRUMP: I didn't even know he endorsed me. David Duke endorsed me? OK.  All right. I disavow it. OK?(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: No surprise the conflicting answers were pounced stunned by Trump's opponents. Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't care how bad the ear piece is, Ku Klux Klan comes through pretty clearly and he refuses to criticize it.  SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We should all be united in saying that the Klan is reprehensible and has no place in politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: The last GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, also weighed in posting on Twitter, quoting, ""A disgusting and disqualifying response by Donald Trump to the KKK, his coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America."" Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and the White House also took swipes at Trump for his answers regarding the KKK -- Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you.  Joining me now with more, former Republican presidential candidate, Governor Mike Huckabee. Governor, great to see you. What do you make of that? Let's start with Mitt Romney's response suggesting this is coddling of bigotry and disqualifying for Donald Trump.MIKE HUCKABEE, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm amazed that Mitt would say that. I mean, Donald Trump has repeatedly disavowed David Duke, disavowed the Klan. I don't think anybody --KELLY: When did he repeatedly disavow the Klan?HUCKABEE: Well, he did it in his Twitter account. He did it on Friday.  He did it today, repeatedly.  KELLY: The Klan or David Duke?HUCKABEE: Well, both. And I don't know of anybody who has ever suggested that Donald Trump is a racist. I'm not speaking as somebody who's out there advocating for Trump. I just want to say that I just don't think that Donald Trump has given any indication that he's supportive of the Ku Klux Klan.KELLY: Not accepting that interview --  (CROSSTALK)Not accepting that interview is what his critics say because it was so strange that he would say on Friday, I disavow David Duke, and then when specifically asked on Sunday, act like he didn't know who David Duke was.HUCKABEE: You know, I can't answer that. You know, I really can't.  You'll have to ask Donald Trump because I haven't talked to him about it.  But the fact is --KELLY: How do you explain that? I mean, his critics say is, the explanation is, he heard very well and he was trying to give some sort of a dog whistle --HUCKABEE: But his critics say he heard very well --  KELLY: -- to people in the south who don't want to hear David Duke disavowed. That's what Mitt Romney is suggesting right there.  HUCKABEE: Sure. Mitt Romney wasn't on the earpiece, neither was Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz and I wouldn't either. So, I don't know what he heard.KELLY: But Trump heard, Trump heard David Duke in that earpiece, you know that, because he repeated back David Duke to Jake Tapper.  HUCKABEE: Yes. Look, here's the one thing I think is important, is Donald Trump a racist? I don't think he is. Does Donald Trump support the KKK?  Heavens no. I don't think anybody seriously is suggesting that he is giving a wink and a nod at the KKK. They're a deplorable, disgusting, abominable, entity. I mean, sometimes I'm amazed that they even still exist. I just don't know of anybody who embraces them anymore except for a handful of crazy people.  KELLY: But the very point you're making --  (CROSSTALK)No brainer is what makes his response to Jack Tapper so confusing to many.  HUCKABEE: That's why I have to wonder, what did he hear -- did he misunderstand it? I just don't know --KELLY: Governor, you know what he heard. He repeated back David Duke and --HUCKABEE: No, I don't know.  KELLY: -- White supremacist right to Jake Tapper. So, you at least know he heard that.HUCKABEE: Right. And one of the things that has happened, he's disavowed Friday, he disavowed today. I don't know why he didn't say it as clearly on Sunday to Jake Tapper. I simply don't know. But I think the issue is not why did one time out of a dozen did he stumble with that name, stumble with the question. The issue is, why don't people take all of the other different -- very clear answers he's given and I don't think that this is the big issue going into Super Tuesday. I think there are important issues. Unfortunately, we lost all of them.  KELLY: If we're dealing with, you know, a difference in perception towards, you know, some Americans versus others, it's obviously relevant.  That's what his critics would say. And it comes on the heels of him criticizing a judge in a case in which Trump is being sued for allegedly defrauding people subscribing to his Trump University in which case Trump just dismissed the judge in that case and a negative ruling for Trump saying, well, he's Spanish, he's Hispanic. That's fine, but he's Hispanic. So he just got hit for making an odd reference to someone's national origin a couple days before he said this. I mean, do you find that problematic? Do you find that --HUCKABEE: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought --KELLY: Well, you're saying, I don't know why anybody would be raising this. Does anybody think that there's racism? And I'm saying this is what the critics have been hitting him for.HUCKABEE: Well, the critics have been hitting him all over the place for everything and I think that's part of politics. I think the whole election has gotten silly, it's gotten out of control. The back and forth with all of the candidates has become absurd.KELLY: Uh-hm.HUCKABEE: We need to be focusing on the issues that really touch every American every day. And unfortunately, we've been lost in the size of ears and hands and wedding pants. And the things that --  KELLY: That's wetting, w-e-t-t-i-n-g. Not wedding pants like your tuxedo pants.  HUCKABEE: No, not wedding. Wetting.KELLY: It actually come to that.  HUCKABEE: Yes. Absolutely. And it's crazy. And I think that it's time to get this whole train back on the track. And part of that would be to say that if somebody has an allegation that Donald Trump has ever does, perhaps, one day would embrace the KKK, bring it forth. But I just don't see any evidence of that. And it's not evident in his family, his business. I think it would have shown up before now.  KELLY: Understood. Governor, great to see you.  HUCKABEE: Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY: Well, our next guest is Republican Congressman Peter King, who had this to say about Mr. Trump's failure to condemn the White supremacist David Duke in that the interview yesterday. Quote, ""Trump told Jake Tapper he doesn't know who David Duke is or white supremacist organizations stand for. If Trump's statement is true, then he's genuinely dumb. If he's lying, that is shameful. In either case, he should not be running to lead the United States.""Joining me now, Congressman King. Congressman, thanks for being here. So, you heard Governor Huckabee's response to this which is, Trump said he had a bad earpiece and didn't necessarily hear. Trump's history doesn't suggest that he's a racist.  REP. PETER KING, R-N.Y.: First of all, the earpiece was obviously working. Because he was repeating him verbatim what the question was. And there's nothing tricky about this. This is nuclear Science. David Duke, that should have been a two-second answer, David Duke is evil, I don't want to support, Ku Klux Klan is evil, I don't want their support. There's nothing to debate here. This isn't like sort of ObamaCare, with the national debt or the budget, this is a clear question of good and bad, good and evil.KELLY: But in Trump's defense, he did on Friday on camera and then on Facebook and Twitter condemn David Duke prior to not condemning him with Tapper.  KING: Yes, again, this is part of the, you know, erratic nature of Donald Trump. And you notice the first time he disavowed it, he did it almost in an annoying way, yes, OK, I disavow him, OK, are you satisfied? Almost annoyed he was asked the question. Jake Tapper asked him in a serious way, Donald Trump seemed to resent being asked the question. I'm not saying he is a racist, I'm saying that he will say whatever he has to say at the moment that he's temperamental and he's erratic and that he doesn't realizes the consequences of what he's saying.I mean, he says he's going to stand up to Putin, he's going to have all of these international trade agreements and arms deals and everything else, and he couldn't even handle Jake Tapper on the question of whether or not he accepted he supported David Duke or accepted. This to me is sort of emblematic of Trump's style. He says what he has to say, then if he gets caught, he lies about it. And he doesn't really like the full the consequence of what he's saying.  KELLY: What he told Tapper two days after he disavowed David Duke, was honestly, I don't know David Duke.KING: Right.KELLY: And this is what happened with ""The New York Times"" reporter Serge Kovaleski who was born with a congenital issue --KING: Right.KELLY: -- and Trump imitated, it appeared that he was imitating that congenital issue.KING: Uh-hm.KELLY: And then when caught, he said, I didn't even know him, I wasn't imitating him, I didn't even know him.KING: Yes.  KELLY: But Serge came out and said, I covered him for 20 years, he absolutely knows me, I interviewed him a dozen times, we're on a first-name basis. And said the same thing that Trump was running away from an allegation he made that got him in hot trouble rather than, you know, admitting what he had done.  KING: Yes. When in trouble, he lies. I mean, he lies flagrantly. And he's able to get away with it. And that's why we have to keep it from happening again in the future. There is no doubt that -- there's no way he can defend the interview about David Duke. And now he is just out and out lying about it. This is a guy who says he's tough, he's a tough guy from Queens. Let me just say this Megyn, I grew up in Queens. The neighborhood he grew up in Queens, that is where rich, pampered kids lived, Jamaica Estates. No tough guy ever came out of there Jamaica Estates. I can tell you that.This is all a bluff, it's all bravado. Saw it with Jake Tapper. We saw it with you, Megyn, bring you back into it. I mean, this guy will just say whatever he has to say and then when he's confronted, he backs down, I didn't mean that, I really meant something else. And he's not qualified to be president.  KELLY: Congressman Peter King. Good to see you, sir.  KING: Megyn, thank you.  KELLY: And folks, you can count on Fox News tomorrow for complete Super Tuesday coverage starting at 6:00 p.m. Bret Baier and I will be live reporting on the biggest night so far in the 2016 race. Thirteen states and nearly 600 delegates are up for grabs for the GOP. We'll bring you the results as they come in live tomorrow night. It's going to be an exciting night. This could be it, folks. Don't miss it.And the next GOP debate, is this Thursday March 3rd, 9:00 p.m. right here on the Fox News Channel. Yours truly will be moderating alongside Bret Baier and Chris Wallace. All of the candidates are planning on attending.  Don't miss it, 9:00 p.m. Thursday.  And still ahead tonight, with less than four hours to go until the very first votes are cast on Super Tuesday, there is some confusion over what exactly is at stake and whether we could be looking at fewer candidates come Wednesday.Chris Stirewalt breaks down the numbers and the likely scenarios and then Dr. Ben Carson is here with his message for voters tomorrow.  Plus, a stunning First Amendment story that you have to see. After Ben Shapiro's invitation to speak at a public university leads to an epic effort to shut him down, wait until you see what happened.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: We are now less than 24 hours away from our first results of Super Tuesday and the candidates are working around the clock. These are live pictures from our Fox affiliate KRIV in Houston where a Ted Cruz rally is about to begin. New polls output Donald Trump more than 15 points ahead of his closest rival in the Real Clear Politics national average. But what exactly is at stake tomorrow?Chris Stirewalt is our FOX News digital politics editor. Chris, great to see you. So, this is, what, 500-plus delegates, so what should we be looking for tomorrow night?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, here's the way to think about. It is half of the delegates you need to win the Republican nomination. It's a quarter of all of the delegates' total. It is the biggest single day. Now, it is broken down in a different way. Once you get to the 15th of the month and you get to winner take all boom, boom, boom, then you can rack up a victory very quickly. This one will be proportional and it will break down into the expectation right now that if the pre-election polling is accurate, that Donald Trump could win 40 percent, maybe 50 percent even based on one poll that seems kind of wild, but that maybe 40 percent or more of the total delegates could fall Donald Trump's way if some of these pre-election polls are right. But we don't have a ton of reliable polling in these states and we don't have reliable polling certainly that can match up with a news cycle that is moving this fast.  KELLY: Uh-hm. Because a lot of these polls were taken prior to the last few big elections and events and debates and so we don't exactly know the temperature of the electorate but, you know, the national poll gives us some idea. Let me ask you about what Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Ted Cruz has said this is the biggest, the most important night in his campaign. It is. Isn't it?STIREWALT: Sure, because if he doesn't win Texas, it's no bueno. There is no --  KELLY: If he doesn't win Texas, do you expect him to announce he's getting out?STIREWALT: It depends on what he wants to happen with Donald Trump, it depends on what he wants to happen with his party, it depends on a lot of stuff. It depends on how well he and Marco Rubio can get along. Rubio, his advantage by his calendar, his home state doesn't come until the 15th.  But basically it's true if you can't win your home state --KELLY: Uh-hm. It doesn't bode well.  STIREWALT: You can't really go forward. Yes.  KELLY: How about Rubio? He's not saying what state he expects to win, if any, on Super Tuesday.  STIREWALT: Right. Rubio needs a win somewhere. He needs to be at least clearly ahead of Cruz and the delegate count. He needs to harness this momentum he has had with his lambasting of Trump and fighting his way on to the front pages, fighting his way into the coverage with the tough talk with Trump. He's got to show that he can take advantage of that. That he's consolidating all of these endorsements and advantages that he's getting.KELLY: Yes.STIREWALT: So, a win would be nice. But a ton of delegates are necessary.  Because what Cruz and Rubio and the Republicans have to do is hold Trump down tomorrow because if he breaks loose, if he gets into open field running here, this sucker is over.  KELLY: Now, up after you is Ben Carson. He can hear you. You better tell the truth, anyway.STIREWALT: OK.KELLY: What does he need to do tomorrow?STIREWALT: I'm going it use a series of hand signal -- no. That is -- Ben Carson has made it very clear that that's between his voters and his donors and his lord, and whatever he's going to do, he's going to do. But the path for him just as it is for John Kasich does not look robust from here.KELLY: All right. I'm going to discuss that with the good doctor momentarily and it's all your fault. Chris, great to see you.STIREWALT: You bet.KELLY: Well, in past election cycles Super Tuesday is often a moment when we see the field narrow even further. But Dr. Ben Carson who occupies one of the last two spots in most polls today said he's not going anywhere despite the growing calls in some circles for him to drop out. In an op-ed on FOXNews.com, Dr. Carson says, quote, ""It is a fundamentally undemocratic response to insinuate that people should be stripped of their choice for the good of the party. That's why I've vowed to continue our campaign as long as we have revenue and support until the people have decided.""Joining me now, Dr. Ben Carson. Doctor, great to see you.  BEN CARSON, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you.  KELLY: Sorry about that. But, you know, you've heard others say that you and John Kasich, for that matter, don't have a path, they don't see a path forward for you realistically if you don't win significantly tomorrow. Do you agree with that?CARSON: It will be more difficult if we don't pick up some significant delegates tomorrow. But I expect that we may well do that. Because recognize a lot of things have happened in the last week. And one of the things that happened is, we had a debate if you can call it that. And after that debate, I went into the spin room and the most common question from the international correspondents was, aren't you embarrassed? Isn't your country embarrassed? And, you know, the people of America I think are getting a much better chance to recognize who the people are who are running and is that the kind of person that they want representing the United States of America?KELLY: To whom are you referring?CARSON: I'm referring to all five of us who are on that stage. They have an opportunity to see what kind of people we are, what gravitas do we bring to the stage, and are we really interested in solving the problem?KELLY: When you see the dustup that we've seen today, for example, between Marco Rubio and Donald Trump, is it embarrassing to the Republican Party?CARSON: I believe it is, absolutely.KELLY: Why?CARSON: I think we should be talking -- because I think we should be talking about the issues that threaten our country. We should be talking about the national debt. Have you heard any politician talking about the fiscal gap? And yet you're talking about the financial foundation of our country.KELLY: Uh-hm. Or ISIS.  CARSON: Yes, or ISIS, or how we're going to deal with them. How we're going to deal with an incredible educational crisis that's going on. I don't hear much talk about that at all. And that actually impacts upon our national security.  KELLY: Uh-hm. But let me ask you because your adviser, Armstrong Williams, said Super Tuesday will be a moment of truth for your campaign and said it will be obvious if your predictions of what could happen for your campaign don't come to fruition, it's obvious what the outcome will be. He's signaling that you're going to get out after Super Tuesday if you don't have a great night. Will you?CARSON: Well, you know, Armstrong is entitled to his opinions. I have multiple advisers. And I am not really listening to the pundits. I'm listening to my donors. I'm listening to my supporters. And I have millions of them and they're saying, please do not get out, we don't want to be left in a situation where we have to choose between the lesser of evils. I think they have a right to say that.KELLY: Last question for you. Donald Trump, you heard the dustup on Sunday with Jake Tapper, a day or two after saying, he disavowed David Duke, he said he didn't know who David Duke was and did not disavow him in that interview or the KKK. Mitt Romney today suggesting that he is coddling bigotry and that this is a disqualifying moment for him. Your thoughts on that?CARSON: Well, I'm a little surprised to know that he doesn't know who David Duke is. That's really quite shocking and that probably should be the area that maybe is investigated a little bit more. But I hope when he learns who David Duke is he would run another direction.  KELLY: Well, he has disavowed him at least, you know, on Friday and then online, but do you agree with Mitt Romney that this is, quote, ""disqualifying and disgusting?""CARSON: Certainly if he did not disavow him, that would be disqualifying, but if he comes out and very clearly and vigorously says, I want nothing to do with a hate group, then I think that's fine.KELLY: Dr. Carson, always great to see you.CARSON: Thank you, Megyn.  KELLY: All the best.Well, another big political story broke late today when reports surfaced that ""The New York Times"" apparently has off-the-record audio tape of Mr. Trump offering a new take on one of his toughest immigration stands or so the reports suggest. The national spokesperson for the Trump campaign is next on that. Katrina Pierson is here.  Also here, Drew Stevens, he's worked on five presidential campaigns and he is now getting a lot of attention for his take on this race.  Plus, a distressing First Amendment story after Ben Shapiro's invitation to speak at a public, public, I say, university leads to massive efforts to shut him down. Hello, First Amendment, where are you? Ben is here on who he thinks is behind this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, a report from BuzzFeed getting a lot of attention today as the website reports, quote, ""Donald Trump secretly told The New York Times what he really thinks about immigration."" Or did he?Carl Cameron is our chief political correspondent. He has the details. Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Megyn. On the eve of Super Tuesday, with almost half of the delegates necessary to clinch the republican nomination, there are new questions tonight about the true feelings of frontrunner Donald Trump when it comes to how to deal with illegal immigration.Both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are taking Trump to task. And earlier today, they both demanded that he give permission to The New York Times to release audiotapes of a January editorial board that Trump had with the editors of The New York Times, some of it was on the record and some of it was off the record.And according to some reports now, Trump may have suggested that when it comes to illegal immigration, he might not deport all 11 million and when it comes to his steps to reform legal immigration, what he may have been saying to the board of -- the ed board at The New York Times in the off the record segment was that while he says some things on the campaign trail, he may not actually believe them, but what he's doing is staking out bargaining positions in order, in Trump's words, eventually to cut a deal.Today, Ted Cruz called Trump out and said he should give The New York Times permission to release the off-the-record audiotape to clear the air. Cruz said if Trump is lying to the voters, the voters deserve to know. And if Trump didn't express different opinions in the off-the-record segment, he should be able to essentially be exonerated by calling on The New York Times to release the tape and prove that he didn't say it.Marco Rubio chimed in on it as well. They are both now pounding Trump. He's taken more attacks from these two in the last week than in any time during his campaign. And it is not going to stop.Obviously tomorrow's a very big night for Trump. He's expected to win more delegates than any other candidate, but with this question about his signature issue now looming with both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio coming at him, Trump may have to answer questions about whether his immigration policy and proposals were essentially fraudulent. Very, very tough stuff coming on the -- tomorrow on the eve of one of the most consequential election days that takes place so far, Megyn.KELLY: Carl, Thank you. Joining me now with more, Katrina Pierson and Stuart Stevens. First, we'll go to Stewart. He serve as a campaign strategist to republican 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, and he's a founding partner at Strategic Partners and Media. Stuart, good to see you.STUART STEVENS, ROMNEY 2012 CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST: Good to see you.KELLY: So, the implication is Trump's behind closed doors language about what he's going to do on illegal immigration does not match his tough rhetoric. And the question now by these other candidates is should he call on The Times to release the tapes? Your thoughts?STEVENS: Well, of course he should. Look, these remarks aren't being audited. He doesn't have any excuse not to. I don't understand why in the world he wouldn't demand that The New York Times release it.We've had sort of a pattern here of whether or not he said this or did this or he comes up with different excuses. It's simple. They've got an audiotape. We're not talking about notes. Play the audiotape so everybody can hear it.KELLY: Yes, but these candidates all go in and have some off-the-record discussions with journalists, and what kind of a precedent does it set if one of the reporters receiving the off-the-record communication then sort of with a wink and nod tells the world there's something dicey in here, and the candidate gets pressured to release it? I mean, it's like you can't ever have the off-the-record briefing.STEVENS: Well, first of all, we don't know where it came from, this idea that what he did say this, we don't know that it came from The New York Times. Not from other journalist that...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well, we do because Buzzfeed is reporting that Gale Collins' Saturday piece is, quote, ""A bit more than speculation,"" according to sources familiar with the recording and the transcript. And in her column, she was address addressing Trump saying, ""So, you obviously can't explain how you're going to deport 11 million immigrants because it's going to be the first bid in some future monster negotiation session.""So, they're suggesting he's not really going to do it, it's just a first bid.STEVENS: Look, the way to clear this up, as you know, if the source calls for it to be released, they should release it. I mean, that happens all the time. You get called by reporters. You go off-the-record and then they come back and say I'd like to use this, is it OK to put that on the record? You go sure, or not.He should put this on the record and come forward and then everybody can know what was said. This wasn't a bar conversation. It wasn't something that just happened in passing. He's still the editor of The New York Times, you'd think he's being careful about what he says and means what he says. Let's hear what he says.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Before I let you go, Stu, your thoughts on the whole David Duke KKK controversy?STEVENS: Listen, I think it's disgusting. I don't believe that he didn't know exactly what he was doing, that on the eve of the southern primaries that he was out there trolling for votes in some despicable way.Look, for my point of view, I think that Donald Trump has crossed a line. To support him really has become a moral question, not just a political question. Everybody has to come to their own decision. Ronald Reagan said a time for choosing. But I don't think that you can go back now where Donald Trump is trying to take this party.KELLY: Stuart, great to see you.STEVENS: See you.KELLY: Katrina Pierson is also here, she is the national spokesperson for the Trump campaign. So, let's start with this New York Times, this Buzzfeed report about Trump's meeting with The New York Times and whether -- well, I'll start with what his critics are saying that you should tell the world whether Donald Trump is going to call on The New York Times to release the transcript.KATRINA PIERSON, DONALD TRUMP NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Well, I think, Megyn, most people would agree that Donald Trump doesn't play by the rules everyone else sets upon him and not themselves. And so, Donald Trump isn't going to call for anything to be released just because Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio said so.First I'll say that. Secondly, this interview was back in January. All of a sudden in the 25th hour the night before the election, all of a sudden there's some top-secret bombshell? Give me a break. This is politics at its finest. If you want to know Byron York...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: You think this is a political hit by The New York Times?PIERSON: It's completely a political hit. Byron York met with Mr. Trump and did an exclusive interview written in the Washington Examiner and even talked about making deals and negotiations but not on the core issues of deportation and other issues that are in his actual platform. So, this is nothing that's top secret, Megyn.KELLY: He said -- he told Byron York that it doesn't mean I'm hard and fast 100 percent. He said, it doesn't mean I'm not going to negotiate a little bit, but I have very strong positions on the issue. So, I mean...(CROSSTALK)PIERSON: Exactly.KELLY: If that's all The Times has they should release it dealt at the end of this. Let's talk about the David Duke, the KKK thing. Why -- why Katrina, why in that Sunday interview didn't he just say what he said on Friday, which is I denounce David Duke, period?PIERSON: Well, yes, well, you're right. The problem with the second interview, the one Sunday morning, is he did have trouble hearing at the very first when Jake Tapper mentioned an organization that Mr. Trump was not familiar with.If you listen to Mr. Trump throughout the entire interview, he keeps talking about groups, organizations, not individuals. He did not have a name correlation to that organization which is simply why he said, Jake, send me what you have so I can see it before I cast a judgment. And that was it.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But I did go back to look at that. Well, you know, with all due respect to Bill, he doesn't get to decide that, the voters do. But I did go back and look at it. Tapper asked him, ""Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say you don't want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election?""That's what he asked him. And he said, I don't know anything about David Duke, I don't know what you're talking about with white supremacists, I don't know. So, he heard what Tapper said, David Duke and white supremacist. There wasn't anything about other groups. And Trump indicated that he heard both pieces of it, Duke and white supremacist.PIERSON: Right. The miscommunication came in at the very beginning when...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: That is the very beginning. That is the very beginning.PIERSON: Well, the anti-defamation league that's what Jake Tapper started with. The anti-defamation league.KELLY: He said I want to ask you about the anti-defamation league which this week called on to publicly condemn...PIERSON: Which Mr. Trump didn't know anything about. That's my point though, Megyn.KELLY: But he wasn't saying condemn the anti-defamation -- he doesn't know who the anti-defamation league is?PIERSON: He wasn't connecting the names to those organizations. And Jake Tapper mentioned groups early on. And Mr. Trump kept referring to groups throughout the entire thing. Mr. Trump has condemned David Duke, he's been doing it all weekend.And then all of a sudden there is one incident where he was refused about the groups that Jake Tapper was talking about, it's a big deal. It's not a big deal. Mr. Trump has condemned David Duke. And by the way, David Duke did not endorse Trump, so it is a non-issue.KELLY: He didn't endorse him but clearly is supporting him and told his followers Duke is now the...(CROSSTALK)PIERSON: Mr. Trump can do nothing about that, though, Megyn. He can do nothing about who is supporting him. You know, this is about David Duke.KELLY: Well, but it's easy -- it's very easy to say I don't want anything to do with him. I mean, let me just -- let's just play...(CROSSTALK)PIERSON: But then he has saw that.KELLY: I want the audience to hear what Ronald Reagan said when -- it's not on tape. OK.PIERSON: Right.KELLY: So, Ronald Reagan apparently came out when the Klan leaders in Georgia endorsed him and said ""Those of us in public life can only resent the use of our names by those who seek political recognition for the repugnant doctrines of hate they espouse.""He went on to say ""The politics of racial hatred and religious bigotry practiced by the Klan and others have no place in this country, and they are destructive for the values for which America has always stood."" That's what people wanted to hear.PIERSON: Well, that's what they wanted to hear. And Ronald Reagan also said I didn't endorse them, they endorsed me. There is nothing you can do about that.But the facts are, even David Duke himself come out and said I did not endorse Donald Trump, and yet, all of the headlines today for the entire day has been the KKK endorses Trump. And just simply not true.When Mr. Trump heard first about it he disavowed it unequivocally and immediately. And then when he was confused about the groups that Jake Tapper was talking about, because we have heard that there was no endorsement. So, of course, Mr. Trump said, let me know who you're talking about before I render judgment of an organization that I didn't know.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well, he did let him know. He made very clear who he was talking about. Very clear. And now Trump is claiming that his earpiece didn't work. But he did repeat back the things.I will say this, David Duke told his people that it would be that it's their duty, their duty to go out to vote for Donald Trump because it would be against their heritage if they voted for, quote, ""these people,"" these other people running. But that is...(CROSSTALK)PIERSON: Mr. Trump can't control anything anybody says to anyone.KELLY: Absolutely not. Absolutely not. I don't mean to tar him with David Duke, it's just, you know, based on the exchange he had with Tapper. Kat, great to see you.PIERSON: Great to see you.KELLY: Well, as we wait to see what Ted Cruz offers up as his message to voters tomorrow, Judge Napolitano is here with some new details on the court case over whether Senator Cruz is eligible to run.Plus, hundreds of protesters show up at a public college to shut down a speech by conservative writer Ben Shapiro. Ben is here on what he thinks is really behind an attempt to silence him.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CROWD CHANTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was the crowd that greeted conservative writer Ben Shapiro as he was attempting to give a speech at the Los Angeles Campus of California State University. Inside the lecture hall where he had been invited, it went like this, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEN SHAPIRO, DAILYWIRE.COM EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Folks, if you're watching on the line stream the waves of the students entering right now are being sneaked in. Because in America in 2016, you have to use the back door if you want to participate in free speech, you get to block the front door if you're a member of the left. And this is how it's written. You won't -- and there it is, gang. Guess what. You know what, they're not going to stop us.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Ben Shapiro is editor-in-chief at dailywire.com. Ben, great to see you. So, they invited you there, this young group and the university was not happy about it. Initially tried to stop it. One professor in particular was ripping down the fliers threatening students for posting them but you showed up. Take it from there.SHAPIRO: Yes, well, the president of the university attempted to cancel the speech. Now I told him to screw himself, I was coming anyway because that was a violation of free speech rights. About an hour and half before I was scheduled to come to campus, I didn't know if they were going to try to arrest me or something.Now he backed down, he said, we'll hold the event, we'll make sure there's enough security that it's safe. I started getting messages on my text and through Twitter, that there was violence going down, that there is a huge crowd.By the time we got there, there were helicopters, cops everywhere, every single entrance and exit except for one had been barricaded and blocked by the students. The police were doing nothing to actually move the student. And the protestors that people who wanted to hear could get in.And by the time I got in, I had to be escorted in not only by my own security but by armed cadre of uniformed police officers and they were sneaking all of the students in four at a time through the back door that the protesters hadn't yet discovered and told them before...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Ok. So, obviously the public university, they don't understand anything about First Amendment, which is the answer to speech you do not like is not less speech, it's more speech. You don't shut down the initial speech, you have your own event, you offer your own viewpoints.But they were rows deep threatening you, people were getting pushed around and the people who wanted to get in to see you were getting stopped by the cops apparently, you say, under directions from the university?SHAPIRO: So, basically what I say is that the police officers were doing nothing. They've been told by the university do not move any of the protesters who locked arms and were blocking off the doors so nobody could get through.And there is plenty of video on Instagram and YouTube of these people who are attempting to just get in to listen being pushed around by members of the audience, they are screaming at them, cursing at them, pushing them, and assaulting them. A reporter from Breitbart was assaulted three times. The man who is disabled with nerve damage, he was assaulted by folks who are protesting. It truly was the fascist left at work.KELLY: I take it no apology was forthcoming?SHAPIRO: No. No, of course not. The only apology they wanted was an apology from me and then from the president for allowing me to speak in the first place.Again, I'm a California taxpayer. I pay for all these adults to go to college here and all these professors to protest and try to tear down fliers. But, you know, this is blatant violation of free speech principle and more than that it's just more evidence that there is a movement within the left, a very hardcore fascist movement within the left to shut down speech that they disagree with, and to punish physically people who they don't like.And that's why at the very end I turned to the students and I said do you want to go out there and confront some of these protesters? And I was told by the police officers, if you do that, there could actually be a riot. They said we don't have the capacity to protect you or the other students. And I'm talking about 10 uniformed officers at the time who are scheduled to protect me.KELLY: Professor Robert Weide, w-e-i-d-e, when people were placing fliers on the board he apparently went out and tore down the fliers, called campus security and called the students fascists who wanted to hear you speak. Ben, thank you for being here.SHAPIRO: Thanks so much.KELLY: Taking your thoughts on that. Facebook.com/thekellyfile.Up next, did the university break any laws? This is a public university. Did they break the law?>Plus, will a citizenship lawsuit be able to move forward against Texas Senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz? Judge Andrew Napolitano is here when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Joining us now with more of the Ben Shapiro situation, Judge Napolitano, who is our Fox News senior judicial analyst. So, does he have a lawsuit against that school, public university shutting down first speech for his First Amendment?ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Of course -- of course he does. The evidence that he was silenced because of the content of his speech is overwhelming. And while the government can do things for public safety, it cannot do something silence you because it doesn't like your message.If this was a private university, it would be a different story. This is the government. Government-owned property. The Supreme Court have said not only cannot silence him, it has a duty to protect him so that he can say what he's brought there to say and the people who want to hear him can hear his words.KELLY: The irony is he's trying to deliver a message about the ridiculousness of safe spaces and micro aggressions and all these trigger warnings that college students need.NAPOLITANO: Right.KELLY: And they are sensitive they can't hear the other side on that and the professors were behind them.NAPOLITANO: This is essentially a speech about the virtues of the freedom of speech and that's what was silenced.KELLY: And that they had to shut down. What's happening with the lawsuits against Ted Cruz and his eligibility to run for president?NAPOLITANO: I don't think it's going to go anywhere. The news peg today is that it was filed by a very serious lawyer who has no skin in the game. It's not a Donald Trump supporter. It's not a Marco Rubio supporter. It's a serious Chicago lawyer, who filed a meaningful lawsuit and a meaningful document supporting it.My own view, he fits squarely within a 1790s era statute saying if one of your parents is an American citizen who spent at least one year of his or her life in the United States before you were born, you are a natural born citizen no matter where your mother was when you drew your first breath.KELLY: How about Hillary Clinton? Because we heard earlier tonight from Catherine Herridge that yet, more e-mails have been released that are classified. Now the number tops 2,000?NAPOLITANO: Over 2,000 e-mails that Mrs. Clinton says when she looked at them she didn't know that they were confidential, secret or top secret. That is utterly without belief.Some of these which mention drone strikes, some of them which mention the names of undercover people working for foreign governments and for us, some of these have transcripts of conversations of foreign government leaders and she didn't know that that stuff was top secret and she sent it on to aides anyway.KELLY: I think it's more and more disturbing and the A.G. Office is looking into it.NAPOLITANO: Absolutely.KELLY: We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Tomorrow night, Super Tuesday. Join yours truly and Bret Baier for the biggest night in the 2016 race so far. Thirteen states nearly 600 delegates up for grabs. Do you know what that's a reference to? Facebook/thekellyfile.

7	7	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/08/01/was-hillary-dnc-speech-effective/	Was Hillary's DNC speech effective?	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" July 29, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight. Let's get right to our top story. The aftermath of the Democratic convention. Hillary Clinton gave voters the hard sell last night unleashing everything she has got against Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Donald Trump can't even handle the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign.(CROWD BOOING)He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he has gotten a tough question from a reporter, when he is challenged in a debate. When he sees a protester at a rally. Imagine, if you dare imagine, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get, America is great because America is good.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Trump was on the receiving end of a blistering attack by Democrats all week and seems to have had enough.DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The things that were said about me. I mean, should guy through some of the names? You know what? I wanted to. I want to do hit a couple of those speakers so hard. I would have hit them, no, no.(CHEERS)I was going to hit -- I was all set and then I got a call from a highly respected governor, how's it going, Donald? I said well, it's going good but they are really saying bad things about me. I'm going to hit them so hard. I was going to hit one in particular. A very little guy. I was going to hit this guy so hard his head would spin he wouldn't know what the hell happened. And he came out of nowhere.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Wow!Joining us now with reaction from Dallas, Trump campaign national spokeswoman Katrina Pierson. Now, Katrina, the very little guy Mr. Trump was referring to in the speech I'm guessing and tweeted today about little Michael Bloomberg. Is that who he was talking about?KATRINA PIERSON, DONALD TRUMP SPOKESWOMAN: Well, Mr. Trump didn't say so I won't say. But I think your inference could be spot on. Mr. Trump was definitely defending himself. And, you know, I think the quote from Hillary Clinton you just played are really indicative on why Mr. Trump is beating her in the polls right now. Because people are tired of this make believe fantasy land that everything is okay and there is nothing to see here, move along. We finally have a candidate that's willing to stand up for himself and fight back for a change.BOLLING: Um-huh. Yes, that Michael Bloomberg speech. It seemed that it was very, very, it's very attackish and kind of shocked me a little bit, too. But listen, this is what politics are all about. Let's talk about what you just mentioned, Mrs. Clinton's comments last night. She was hitting Mr. Trump or Donald Trump very hard on this tweeting issue. Now, Donald Trump has done very well with Twitter. He gets his message out there. But she says that because you can instigate a twitter fight with him, he may not be the guy that has access to the nuclear, to the button.PIERSON: Well, I mean, this is another reason why Mrs. Clinton struggles with younger people. I mean, this is a medium of choice and it's been one of the ways that Mr. Trump has been able to fight back against the liberal media that has tried to paint his policies for him. And Twitter has been a great resource for Mr. Trump. And there are millions of millennials who are on Twitter and who are getting his message.BOLLING: The word is that he and Mrs. Clinton will be receiving national security briefings coming very soon. What will Donald do with those?PIERSON: Well, he is going to take them very seriously. You know, one of the things Mr. Trump has always said that he wants to take in the information and lead the generals make the decisions and what we know with Hillary Clinton, particularly throughout this week is there really was no mention of what was going to be changed and we hear a lot of talk about her resume and her qualifications but what's really important are the decisions that she has made while she had those titles like when she was secretary of state and we have had an influx of refugees coming into this country.We see what's happening in other countries and she wants to do more of that. Her plan, Eric, is to have more intelligence but why didn't she do that while she was secretary of state because now we know after the email investigation that she had intelligence and she misused that intelligence as well as when people died under her watch. She lied about it and that's the case that's going to be made moving forward.BOLLING: The Trump campaign is suggesting that maybe Hillary Clinton shouldn't have these National Security briefings because of what happened with the email, with the FBI being under investigation with the FBI. Hillary Clinton camp says, Donald shouldn't have it because of his comments about Russia looking for the 33,000 emails. First of all, where -- did he mean -- was he serious about that he said, his tongue in cheek, where is he?PIERSON: Oh, it's absolutely tongue in cheek which is exactly why he included the press will be thankful in that comment. But Mr. Trump is absolutely right. I mean, now you have the Department of Justice who have reopened the investigation into Hillary emails simply because there needs to be consequences as the FBI Director Comey has even said. That if that person had worked for him they would probably lose their security clearance. Mr. Trump is not investigated by the FBI.He hasn't done anything that could thwart national security. Hillary Clinton has, that's the problem and that's the difference and that's why you have seen it this last convention where people are still wondering, is she even going to address the email situation? Is she going to talk about Benghazi? Because that's what people want to know about her is why her poll numbers have tanked in honesty and I think it's really important moving forward.BOLLING: Katrina, last night, one of the -- probably the most compelling speaker for me clearly was not Hillary Clinton. I think one of the most compelling was, because you're kind, he's the father of the Muslim U.S. soldier from Virginia who was killed in action and he said, you haven't sacrificed anything. How do you respond to something like that? It was an emotional moment.PIERSON: It was absolutely an emotional moment. And, you know, everyone sympathizes with any parent that's lost a child under any circumstances. But if we go back to day one of the DNC Convention, where there was not a single American flag in the arena and, in fact, Eric, there was a Palestinian flag and on the outside of the arena, they were burning American flags as well as Israeli flags in their protest. So we have a situation where we have to put American citizens first.We cannot delay this any longer. I mean, it is truly unfortunate that we have lost so many lives because of terrorism. But, we have hundreds of millions of people in this country that we cannot succumb to people's feelings. It's about national security and the best interest of the people who are here. And the policies under even Bill Clinton letting Osama Bin Laden go, moving forward 15 years. We have been in a war and Hillary Clinton says we need to work with our allies. Well, where has that been this whole time?BOLLING: All right. Katrina, before we go, as a woman, do you feel any sense of history being made here with Hillary being the first female presidential candidate of a major party in America?PIERSON: I don't. It was actually a little anti-climactic for myself simply because it's unfortunate that, you know, all women really want to see a woman as president but not under these circumstances. Not someone that's been investigated by the FBI, who left Americans in Libya to die, who has lied and cheated. Over the last three years collected $22 million in special interest and trade and from global corporations and is now out there lying to the American public. It is exactly what Barack Obama said in 2008. Hillary Clinton will say anything and change nothing and most Americans realize that.BOLLING: All right. Katrina, thank you very much.PIERSON: Thank you, Eric.BOLLING: Now, let's bring in Democratic strategist Bernard Whitman, author of the new book ""52 Reasons to Vote for Hillary."" Bernard, you listened to Katrina Pierson. There is some compelling push back on Hillary Clinton's speech last night by the Trump camp.BERNARD WHITMAN, AUTHOR, ""52 REASONS TO VOTE FOR HILLARY"": Here is the thing that Katrina and more importantly Donald Trump does not get. And it was summed up in three words by Hillary Clinton last night. E pluribus unum. We are all in this together. It was the most profound moment for me in the entire convention. It's something that the Trump campaign certainly doesn't get. And I think that Hillary Clinton needed to do three things last night. Number one, she need to do try sharp contrast with Donald Trump's vision for America and policies. I think she nailed that.Number two, I think she needed to be real. I think she needs to be authentic. I think she needed to acknowledge --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: You know, to be transparent. To be heartfelt. What I heard was, yes, beginning of the speech was like that but then the basis, the meat of that speech was attacking Donald Trump.WHITMAN: But, Eric, but Eric, she drew a contrast to Donald Trump. Donald Trump believes in division, divisive negativity.BOLLING: Means we're together, Democrats or the country?WHITMAN: Democrats, Republicans and the Independents.BOLLING: She called the shots to Republicans, Donald Trump.WHITMAN: No, she made a great effort to draw clear distinctions about how we have two different world views. One in which we are stronger through our diversity. We are inclusive, we are forward looking, we are optimistic, we believe this country is the greatest country on earth. In Cleveland all you heard was negativity. Talking down the economy. Talking down our military, talking down our veterans, complaining, I mean, Donald Trump literally.BOLLING: She painted a picture of a wonderful -- everything is good, did she not?WHITMAN: She said things are great.BOLLING: Are they though?WHITMAN: So much better.BOLLING: Look in that camera right now and tell America that things are great. Now, they may be great for Wall Street and they may be great for people on the two coasts. But flyover countries are saying, our wages aren't up. Our unemployment is still too high. Growth, we got a number today, growth, GDP is subpar.WHITMAN: She said, that's exactly why she said you know what? Thank you Bernie Sanders for bringing issues of social justice and income inequality to the fore. We've created 15 million jobs. The longest and biggest recovery ever in history. Has it been enough? Absolutely not. Which is why her first days in office are going to be spent putting together the biggest single job creation program since World War II.BOLLING: Yes. Before I let you go, it felt like this is the third term of President Obama. She delivered what President Obama would have been delivering, had he been on that stage, where am I wrong?WHITMAN: No, I don't think it's either the third term of President Obama or the third term of Bill Clinton. I think this is going to be the first term and hopefully the second term of Hillary Rodham Clinton.BOLLING: Why? What's different?WHITMAN: Because she is committed to bringing people together working along party lines.BOLLING: Barack Obama wasn't.WHITMAN: Look, President Obama I think deserves huge credit but one thing he was challenged with was working with the other side.BOLLING: Where is she different than President Obama? It sounded like she was up because --WHITMAN: Because Hillary Clinton --BOLLING: -- almost the exact same thing.WHITMAN: I think it's a great question, Eric, and I think that moderate Republicans and conservative leaning Independents need to understand Hillary Clinton has a record of three decades of working across the aisle to do things like provide healthcare to children. Eight million children. She did that with Republicans.BOLLING: Experience doesn't equal being qualified. And that is why I think a lot of people --WHITMAN: There is no question she more qualified than Donald Trump.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" April 27, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of the most solemn choices you make is the choice of selecting a vice presidential candidate. I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be president of the United States that I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee, Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)PAUL MANAFORT, TRUMP CONVENTION MANAGER: It's the second desperation move of the week. The first one didn't work. And this one won't work, either. And, frankly, it's a bit strange that they would announce in Indiana where she, who is known when she was in the private sector for outsourcing jobs, and outsourcing is one of the major issues in Indiana, and Ted Cruz has shown again that he's more focused on free trade than fair trade.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: The big announcement today, Ted Cruz saying he would run with Carly Fiorina, a businesswoman, former presidential candidate. You saw reaction from the Trump campaign. John Kasich's campaign has weighed in now, saying this, ""Carly Fiorina ran an honorable campaign, but most Republicans will meet this decision with a collective shrug.""OK, let's bring in our panel: Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post; editor in chief of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Laura, what about this move?LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE.COM: I think Kasich is probably right. I think there's a good deal of affection I think for Carly Fiorina. I think she ran a pretty good campaign. She didn't win any states. But I think Manafort is on to something. And Indiana, which I assume Trump is going to hit the globalization as failure theme that he struck today in his foreign policy speech, the outsourcing issue is a disaster. That is just, that's not going to be a positive one. And fairly or unfairly, you know, Fiorina, HP, that outsourcing issue, which was discussed obviously during her run against Barbara Boxer in 2010, which she lost by about a million votes in California, that became really an albatross around her neck.I think Trump has to be careful, isn't going after Carly Fiorina. I think I'm not sure he'll do it, but I think surrogates probably will, and I think you saw Manafort do that. I don't think it changes the math in a positive way in Indiana. If he's going to win Indiana, Cruz is going to win it on his own. It's not going to be with a veep selection.BAIER: We should point out Fiorina fought back against that whole charge on the presidential campaign.INGRAHAM: Absolutely.BAIER: Chuck, how do you think it plays?CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Desperate times call for desperate measures, is what it looked like to me. And so desperate after this rout Tuesday night in the northeastern states that Ted Cruz seemed to want to just come up with something spectacular to kind of just change the narrative out there.I suppose that if Carly Fiorina brings anything positive, maybe it's a little help in California. That's her home state. She ran a pretty good Senate primary -- Senate race against Barbara Boxer as a Republican, though she lost. And perhaps Ted Cruz is thinking she can help him out there. But for the most part I think this just looks like what it is. It's somebody who is way behind in the delegate count and the window is rapidly closing, trying to throw a Hail Mary.BAIER: You mentioned the sweep last night. Donald Trump, as you look at the map of the states, did put up some amazing numbers in Republican, in the Republican primaries. Take a look at this, 60 percent in Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, 63 percent. Pennsylvania, he won every congressional district. Cruz people and others say that all of these are blue states in the general election. But as you look towards Indiana, which is coming up next week, the Real Clear Politics average of polls has it now with Trump up about six points over Cruz, and Kasich essentially not campaigning there. Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, just on the Carly issue, I think it had only one purpose, which was news cycle management. He wanted to do something to slightly obliterate the power of last night's election. And it worked in the sense that we just led the panel with his decision. But it won't do anything beyond that.There's a Hail Carly, and it isn't going to do much. The Trump success yesterday is he won every county in all five states. That's a sweep. And it is clear that everything now hinges on Indiana. Even if Trump were to lose it, it's extremely hard to see how he's not nominated. But if he wins, I think that it will be definitively over for Cruz. And I would add we'd be able to close the Candidate Casino, which would save me a lot of money. So I'm hoping we'll do that.BAIER: It still has general election possibilities.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, yes, that's true.BAIER: I want to talk about his unfavorable, because clearly Carly Fiorina is going to go after Trump on the women issue. As you take a look at the USA Today/Suffolk poll on fav-unfav for women for example, 24-56, this is Donald Trump, and then you see Hispanics and among blacks in this particular poll, and it matches other polls as well.INGRAHAM: I think Carly Fiorina ought to think further down the line than just maybe the next week or so, because it would be a shame given I think her positive influence in the campaign if it turned out that Carly was featured in a lot of Hillary ads in the fall. And I would imagine the Hillary Clinton campaign is cutting and marking the time cues on these various appearances.And I think we should remember looking at the exit polls in Pennsylvania and my home state of Connecticut, and so forth, you see that Trump won every demographic group, every one. He won women. He won college- educated, the high school-educated. He won I believe every age group as well.So does he have work to do with women? I think so, yes, without a doubt. But I just think, I said this the other night, at some point we have to have a come to Jesus moment here. I understand Ted Cruz wants to be president and I think he's done an amazing job so far. But do you really want to give the fodder to the Democrats going into a critical election cycle? And I think it would be a shame really if that turned out to be one of the favorite commercials for the Clinton campaign.BAIER: The pushback, we did the whole delegate math and all kinds of reaction saying we're making assumptions on these states. These are the projections, and they're pretty optimistic when it comes to Donald Trump. But he still gets over the hump pretty significantly before the end.LANE: Yes. And there's another factor here, which is there's some polling data that show Republican voters don't want him denied the nomination if he comes very close, right? If he's up at, I guess the target is 1,237, if he's up at 1,200 as of the eve of the convention, it's going to be -- it's going to be a tough lift politically to deny it to him at that point.And I think that's what influences me the most in thinking about this is that he is now so close to being that close that he is, you know, in his own words, he is the presumptive nominee. But it is such a -- it is such a radical thing to have him as the nominee that I think Ted Cruz and the others simply can't get their minds around it and they're going to fight until the last ditch. And in fairness, I don't see why they shouldn't as long as they've got the money.KRAUTHAMMER: But I think the other factor here is the psychological effect of the win in New York and the win in these states, which is essentially over 60 percent. If he were to back into the nomination, or to back into say 1,220, so he's just near it but he's been on a losing streak, I could see people saying no, he's not the choice working on the numbers. If you come into the convention having really swept in the east, and if he does reasonably well in Indiana and of course on the west coast, I don't think there's any way in which if he falls short of a handful of votes, 15, 20, even 50, that he would be denied. That psychological effect, the momentum I think is huge.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

9	9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/10/19/gingrich-joe-biden-will-run-partly-as-insurance-but-as-obama-candidate/	Gingrich: Joe Biden will run, partly as insurance, but as the ‘Obama candidate’	"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" October 19, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Former speaker of the House and the author of the brand new novel, ""Duplicity,"" Speaker Newt Gingrich is here to go ON THE RECORD.Good evening, sir.NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: How are you?VAN SUSTEREN: You know, it's -- I'm fine. I'm playing the parlor game in Washington about Vice President Biden and it's gotten so confusing. I don't remember what I last predicted. So at least I need to have you play.Is Vice President Biden running or not?GINGRICH: Oh, I think he is running. And I think he is running partly as an insurance policy because Hillary may well collapse at some point. I think he is running partly because as she moves to the left, she is taking positions that are increasingly at odds with the Obama policy.And if you'll notice, 90 percent of Obama's major fundraisers have not committed to her, 90 percent. That means that there is a huge group of potential fundraisers who are waiting for the Obama candidate. And I think the signs are the Obama candidate will end up being Joe Biden.VAN SUSTEREN: Why now and certainly now. I mean, there's so much speculation, even speculation that he is going to do it on the eve of Secretary Clinton's testimony before the Benghazi committee.But, you know, why this sort of, you know, drip, drip, drip and the timing problem?GINGRICH: Well, I mean, first of all, I think he had to spend some time in mourning for his son. I think that that was a very real, very deep, very personal pain, and I don't think he could just turn on a dime from that.I think, second, the clock starts to work in terms of entering the South Carolina primary and doing some other key things. And so it becomes a point where you've got to start making a move. But, frankly, Secretary Clinton has had a bad couple months. She has decayed, you know, in one study that I saw when you ask her name and you do word association. The word ""liar"" comes up as the most frequent single word people associate with Hillary Clinton.So if you are Joe Biden watching that, you are thinking, hey, there is going to be an opening here at some point.VAN SUSTEREN: Except you are so popular until you actually announce you are going to run. And all of a sudden, you know, you become a whole lot more, a whole lot less popular. I mean, everyone -- you know, a lot of Democrats love Joe Biden right now, but if he jumps into the race, that honeymoon may be over.GINGRICH: Well, maybe. And I think -- but he has a very good political personality. I mean, he really does love life. He loves people. He loves campaigning. And I suspect that he will be pretty enthusiastic and pretty energetic.You know, there is some talk about his age, but the truth is, he has been running around for six years as the Vice President of the United States. That is not an easy job. And he has certainly shown that he has a great deal of energy when it comes to politics.VAN SUSTEREN: So who does President Obama, if Vice President Biden gets in? Does he just stay silent or does he pick between his former secretary of state and his vice president?GINGRICH: Well, you just showed a second ago the president saying, you know, I left that up to Joe. You know, good friend, he's described the vice president as the best choice he made.Remember, he also made a choice of Hillary Clinton, but he put Biden as the best choice he made. I don't think all those bundlers are sitting around not raising money for Hillary because they are getting signals from Obama that they should. I think they kind of feel like the president doesn't mind them sitting on the sidelines waiting for Joe Biden to enter.VAN SUSTEREN: Mr. Speaker, thank you, sir.GINGRICH: Great to be with you."
