This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 18, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. We have arrived in Las Vegas ahead of the biggest event of the election to date. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and 2 p.m. here in Vegas at the MGM Grand, and this is ""The Five.""Wow. As you can see, it is a beautiful day here in the beautiful city of Las Vegas where in just 24 hours we will see Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton face off for the last time. It's going to make history in many ways. For the first time, a Fox News anchor is going to moderate a general election debate, the one and only fair and balanced Chris Wallace. We know he will do a stellar job, but it's going to be the final opportunity for the nominees to make their case before tens of millions of American voters. If it's anything like the last two, we're going to be in for quite a show.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Maybe he's not as rich as he says he is or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes. So, if he's paid --DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: That makes me smart.LESTER HOLT, NBC ""NIGHTLY NEWS"" ANCHOR: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Whoo! OK.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: This was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologized to my family. I apologized to the American people. Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.CLINTON: When they go low, you go high.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Believe me; she has tremendous hate in her heart.CLINTON: OK Donald, I know you're in to big diversion tonight.TRUMP: Honestly, I've never lied. That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.CLINTON: It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.TRUMP: Because you'd be in jail.MARTHA RADDATZ, MODERATOR: Secretary Clinton --(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIPS)BOLLING: All right. That was some of the highlights or maybe some of the lowlights, depending on your perspective. But Dana, what do you expect for tomorrow night? Is it more of this or little reserved?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, this is the -- as you said, the most important event to date. Although I think you could argue that the first debate was one of the most important because that set the trajectory for the closing arguments that takes place in the last six weeks. Donald Trump is down in the polls. He's had an interesting strategy in the last couple of weeks, which I think is just burn it all down. If he comes in with that attitude tomorrow night, I think that would motivate his supporters and probably not do much to get him the help that he needs in order to get the win across the goal line.BOLLING: Sure. Goal line .PERINO: The kind of pass the goal line or something --BOLLING: . finish line.PERINO: Touch the home base.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Touch home base.PERINO: Something that kind of goal and the net.BOLLING: Off the net.PERINO: I think for him, he could come out and just try to say, ""She's been here 30 years, nothing's gotten done. If you want change, I'm the one for you."" And I think he focuses on e-mails and the foundation. Those are the two things. For her, I think it's -- she has to bring energy and she has to be show a willingness to pushback, which she's shown, but she also has to somehow say that here's my vision for the country. Neither of them has really been able to do that in the past two debates.BOLLING: What's, what's -- all right. So can Donald Trump -- and I think Dana is right, he's got to stay the issues, but if he goes off and starts, you know, talking about the Clinton -- Bill Clinton scandals .GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah.BOLLING: . and whatnot. What's Hillary Clinton's response to that?GUTFELD: Well, I don't think, I don't think -- I mean Hillary is lucky. She doesn't have to do anything in this debate. It's Donald Trump's -- this is Donald Trump's last opportunity -- to go after people that are on the fence. I've been on the fence so long, I need preparation H.PERINO: What else is new?GUTFELD: And so, so I've been thinking about this. I've been thinking about this that I have a golden rule. I would rather vote for someone that I dislike than someone who hates me. So I know that I may have issues with Trump, but I know that Hillary hates people like me. She hates my achievements. She hates where I work. She hates the kind of person I am. She hates my friends. So it would be like me voting for her would be like the bloods voting for the crips. So I think -- so where is that lead? My advice for Donald Trump, which I have here on this sheet of paper, is you have to tell people.PERINO: Oh, boy.GUTFELD: You have to tell people. Look, you don't want to vote for me because you may not like me, all right? You may not like me. But let say you have a surgeon, right? You have a top-notch surgeon with a lousy personality and a terrible surgeon with a sparkling personality, and you're going in for surgery or your mother is going in for surgery. Do you really care if you like that person? I think that's the argument he has to make.BOLLING: Right.GUTFELD: Is that a sound argument, America? Yes, like it is.BOLLING: So I can hear a thawing of the Gutfeld -- it freeze out of the Trump there. So (inaudible) --GUTFELD: No, no. I've never said --GUILFOYLE: Yes.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Every time I go, eh, Trump. Then I see some of the Hillary's supporters just anger me so with their stupid, condescending crap. And I just bounce back and then Trump says something stupid, and then I go back to her and then I think she says something stupid, and I'm like a ping-pong ball.BOLLING: Volleyball.GUILFOYLE: And same size.BOLLING: KG --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: Oh.GUILFOYLE: Oh. I'm sorry.BOLLING: Total --GUTFELD: Be unfair.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: . group of very conservative .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . New Yorkers and they don't love Trump, they don't hate Trump, but they all dislike Hillary. That was clear. So I asked them, how many people could never vote for Hillary? They raised their hand. I said, what - - if you don't, if you don't vote for Hillary, it's a vote for Trump, right? Look at it this way. That door right there, it's a guaranteed death sentence. That door right there, you have a 50/50 chance. You may die by going through that door, but you might survive.PERINO: You might die?BOLLING: All right --GUILFOYLE: That doesn't sound true.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: But if you know and you're sure (inaudible) --GUILFOYLE: How about possibly (inaudible)?BOLLING: I think that Hillary is not your -- she's terrible for the country. Don't you at least have to try the other door?GUILFOYLE: Well, he's made that argument and he said, ""What do you have to lose?"" And he said that at an outreach, independent, to minority voters, African-American communities say, ""Give me a try, you've tried their way."" She's been in politics for 20-plus years. This s is more of the same way of Clinton corruption, crooked, lying, e-mail deletion, sacrificing people, you know Benghazi, lack of focus on national security. I think he needs to not defend himself. And I think he needs to talk about the issues that really work for him that we saw on so much of the exit polling. Talk about the economy, that's one poll that he's definitely been ahead compared to Hillary Clinton. The people trust him to do a better job with the economy, with infrastructure, with free market, that type of thing. You know hit her on the e-mails, for sure. Show that -- yes, in fact she's unfit but she's already been given a chance to demonstrate whether or not she's worthy of the job as it relates to government, and that she has failed the American people. The people aren't better off than they were before and that more men are out of work in this country and not able to provide for their families. Talk to the people that way and I think it will work.BOLLING: Juan, your good friend Chris Wallace will be moderating this debate, and you moderated debates in the past. Will Chris be able to keep these two on issues, as everyone's pointed or if will -- if it goes off into some of these tangents, will he let them?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: He's got to let them.BOLLING: Sure he is.WILLIAMS: Yeah. He's got to let them go off in the tangents. When he start talking to each other, if there's a direct response to a comment from the other, I think Chris' take is he doesn't want to be the news here. He doesn't want to be the star of the show. They are the star. Let them settle the fight. And it's much like, you know, the 12th round of a big fight here in Vegas. Al of the sudden, you think where that rev go? Because everything, you better protect yourself, son, because this is a real fight.GUILFOYLE: Keep your hands up.BOLLING: OK.WILLIAMS: And so right now --BOLLING: Make sure you fight 12 rounds.WILLIAMS: But right now .PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: . what you've got for her is, is, is the reality that in the first two debates, she's did so well, she has been on a straight tangent up, in both -- since both debates. So the question is, you know, she's -- I don't know what Greg has ping-pong ball back and forth because she's been out of the picture in the last few days. She hasn't been around. I mean --GUTFELD: No, but you know -- I guess what I'm saying is when you see how arrogant and disgusting some of her supporters have been towards people. You go like .WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah.GUTFELD: . I don't want to be around those people for four years.WILLIAMS: Oh yeah, really?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: And if I look the inside the Trump campaign .GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . and see what the Bannons of the world are doing and what the people he has fired. I wouldn't have any such start.GUTFELD: But why are they doing that? You know the right --WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah, because they learning.GUTFELD: The right is learning from the left, Juan.WILLIAMS: Get out of here. He said elected.GUILFOYLE: And he's right.WILLIAMS: Please.GUILFOYLE: And she thinks it's OK to divide .WILLIAMS: Oh, no.GUILFOYLE: . minorities and (inaudible) into classifications.WILLIAMS: Oh, please. Who' the most --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Who is more polarizing than Donald Trump? But let me get back to what I was saying which is -- so for her, right now I think the question is, does she fight with him in the way that she did in the first two debates? It worked for her. Or does she do what Dana touched on which is, look, she's got this thing pretty much sewed up at this point, in terms of the --GUTFELD: But Juan --WILLIAMS: And does she then say, hey, you know what, I'm going to offer the visions to the country. I'm taking the high road. Trump had, on the other hand can do this. He can say this is no nasty, so dirty. I'm going to get so despicable.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I'm glad. You know what, that I'm gonna turn off everybody. I hope their people stay home.GUILFOYLE: She's got to be aging of change.BOLLING: That's your analogy. This is the boxing analogy. If there -- it's the 12th round (inaudible) and he's down going into the 12th round, you start looking for that haymaker. You start looking for that knockout.WILLIAMS: Yeah. That's correct.BOLLING: Let's see this.PERINO: What does mean?BOLLING: Let's, let's --GUILFOYLE: Take -- take the knockout punch when it comes.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Or you know what? We are in Vegas Eric. It could -- people do impulsive things. They could just stare each other in the eyes and go, let's get the hell out of here. And they go to a drive-through chapel, get married and they run to the Dominican Republic, you never see them again.BOLLING: Yeah, don't -- that would be --GUILFOYLE: That could happen.BOLLING: Don't bet on that one. All right --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: We got to let them stay here.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: . further decline with female voters as the election nears. Will they give him a second chance after that ""Access Hollywood"" tape emerged? His wife has forgiven him. Melania Trump made an appeal to women voters in a new interview with ""Fox and Friends"" Ainsley Earhardt. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AINSLEY EARHARDT, ""FOX AND FRIENDS"" CO-HOST: What do you say to women that are watching, women voters, female voters that haven't been able to get past it? What do you say to them? What's your message to women?MELANIA TRUMP, WIFE OF DONALD TRUMP: My husband is kind. He's a gentleman. He cares about people. He cares about women. He pushes them to the best level they could be, that he gives them a chance to prosper in his organization and in his campaign. And he's not the man that we saw -- we heard him on the tape.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right KG, a lot of women voters were probably listening. You cannot say, you know what, if she can forgive him, so can I --GUILFOYLE: Yeah, that kind of work at that time with Hillary Clinton, when people felt sorry for when Bill Clinton was cheating on her. But I'll tell you what, I know -- just your show -- I know Melania, personally. She's a really lovely person. She's really warm, very friendly. She loves her husband. She's a great mom, very devoted to Barron. So, you know, I think this is a tough position for her to be in, people can relate to that. This is not anything that anybody would want to have come out especially after you were just married with your husband, but that's between them and you have to decide whether or not that affects his fitness to be able to serve as president.GUTFELD: But --GUILFOYLE: And that's --GUTFELD: But that's --GUILFOYLE: And that's an issue voters may go for.GUTFELD: Kimberly just nailed it in the first sentence. She said this is exactly what Hillary did and it's exactly what we were making fun of Hillary for. Hillary standing by her man, Hillary besmirching the women that were with Bill, now she said that it was --GUILFOYLE: Well, Melania didn't do that.GUTFELD: Well, that is -- it was a coordinated thing and she also said women come up to her husband all the time and hit on her and give her phone numbers. So she was dismissing it.BOLLING: All right.GUTFELD: She was dismissing it, but it's an important point. It may --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It was a very, very important. Now, what it has done, effectively, is remove that criticism, you can no longer go after Hillary --BOLLING: All right. So --GUTFELD: On that.BOLLING: Well he -- OK. I've said this since, since this whole tape came out that it is not right. I don't think what he said was right. I have a loving wife that I would never, ever, ever treat that way and we've taught our son not to. That said; is there room for forgiveness -- the Trump side, from the women voters?PERINO: I just don't think -- I don't know. I don't think anybody blames Melania Trump for it.GUILFOYLE: No.PERINO: I do question and we can get in the B-block. I absolutely question the campaign's media strategy with putting her out on these interviews. I would have done it much differently, because she's a huge asset to the campaign. And I think that was not the best use of her time yesterday. But I also think if you look at the polls, a lot of republican voters said the tape didn't bother them that much. But that Hillary's argument, that he is unfit to be the commander-in-chief, that's the thing that has stocked more. So I don't know if that even matters in terms of forgiveness. I don't think the women voters are coming back.BOLLING: What do you think, Juan, is there a way for -- with this 21 days left for Trump to gain some of the women vote back?WILLIAMS: No. I mean that deal is over. And you know, which -- I mean the most effective thing was when he apologized. He said, you know, it was inappropriate language. And the question is, do you take what Trump said to be sincere? The polls indicate that most people don't. So --PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: I mean that's what I read. So, from my perspective, when I saw her last night, I thought boy, this is a big step because she has not been out. They kept her, I think away after the fiasco at the convention with the (inaudible) and Michelle Obama and all of that. She comes out and says, Billy Bush, the NBC guys who got fired yesterday, he's to blame. He was just pushing Donald Trump. And I thought -- I'm not feeling so good about this.GUTFELD: That, that was -- I think that's another case where they are throwing a guy under the bus when, you know, what the first thing Donald did was he blame and said, ""Well, my golf partner, Bill Clinton said worse."" And then it's now Billy -- now it's Billy Bush's fault. It's like - - that -- you're violating the guy code, as Tyrus once said, you know, ""You don't blame it on another the guy.""BOLLING: Final thought?GUILFOYLE: I was going to say that he got to try anyway. I wouldn't concede the women are obviously, it's going to be uphill battle, but you gonna say, you know what, I embarrassed myself, my wife, my daughter, my children, for that I am greatly sorry. And for my supporters that I've left out, believe me from my heart that I've learned. I've grown to this campaign. Let me make it up to you. Let me be the best president we've seen in this country. Let me create jobs. Let me make the women in this country feel safe from a national security standpoint. Let me be good with the military. Let me repeal and replace ObamaCare, and go down the list --WILLIAMS: Kimberly for president.PERINO: So that -- so that's an excellent --WILLIAMS: Kimberly for president.PERINO: That's an excellent speech .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: . you should have given two weeks ago .WILLIAMS: Yeah.PERINO: . instead he took a different attack and it's not the women that were the accusers.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: All right, we're gonna --PERINO: But a great speech.BOLLING: We have more.WILLIAMS: That's good.BOLLING: We have more.WILLIAMS: That's good.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: . running mates.BOLLING: We have about 46 more minutes to got more to come as ""The Five's"" pre-debate special live from Las Vegas and moves on, more from Melania Trump, next. And later, the State Department is under fire accused of offering quid pro quo to the FBI, to get Hillary Clinton out of her e-mail mess; those details coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Count down, yes.GUILFOYLE: Welcome back to ""The Five"" and we are 24 hours out from the final presidential debate. We are live in Las Vegas where it's all going to go down tomorrow night. Now Trump's been on the defense since the last debate denying accusations from a number of women that he's kissed or groped them. His wife Melania addressed the allegations in a new interview with Ainsley Earhardt.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)M. TRUMP: I was not surprised in one way, because as I said before, everything was organized. Why now? Why three weeks before the election? And what they are accusing my husband -- that is not the person that I know.EARHARDT: What is your message to these women?M. TRUMP: That all the allegations should be handled in a court of law and without evidence to accuse somebody, is a man or a woman, it's damaging and it's unfair.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Mrs. Trump also addressed allegations about her throughout this campaign, accusations that she was once an escort or that she entered this country illegally.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)M. TRUMP: What I will not allow, people saying lies about me, saying lies about my family, my husband and I file a lawsuit and I will fight to the end because I will not allow that.EARHARDT: Is that a double standard with the mainstream media?M. TRUMP: It is a double standard. And I see that mainstream media, they want to damage my family and my husband's campaign.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK Dana, so what did you think of Melania there in that piece I terms of the way she was trying to defend her husband, also a little soft spoken there. It seems a little soft in this some of the other parts of the interview.PERINO: True. OK, I would say in the A-block -- just from a press perspective, I would -- if they want to be use her to change the subject, I think that I would have done a very different scenario. I would've had Ainsley Earhardt from ""Fox and Friends"" go with me to something interesting and find her something I care about. Go to a school, get the pictures. Because instead what you have is a situation where Melania Trump is now, as Greg was pointing out, their biggest complaint against Hillary Clinton, which is a good one, which is how Hillary Clinton treated the women who were Bill's accusers. Now we have several accusers, we have questions of a lawsuit, we have ""New York Times"" story that they're still not allowed to from a Trump campaign on that, and I (inaudible). ""People"" magazine is not going to address except for sort of in a looser way. And I just think that Melania from such an asset to the trump campaign that did her a disservice yesterday by having her sit down and actually bring the news back to these issues. And addition, she said that the issue she wants to work most on is social media bullying, but the social media bullying actually comes directly from her husband against women when he has issues with them, like Alicia Machado, right after the debate, or there's many others. So I just would have done something much different with her yesterday. I think that they put her in a tough position, but she did as well as she could in that scenario.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, I think she did handle herself well, Greg. She did the way she conducted herself, she was warm, personable. And you know Ainsley has done interviews with her before. I thought she did a nice job there, but would have been probably good idea to go to a school, do something like that to talk about bullying, to kind of change the dynamic.GUTFELD: Yeah, look. I look at somebody who just doesn't want to be there. I feel bad for her.PERINO: Yeah.GUTFELD: I think that she's being dragged along into this mess. I think --GUILFOYLE: But that's not what she said. She said nobody can make her do to say .GUTFELD: Well --GUILFOYLE: . or go anywhere.GUTFELD: Yeah, but I don't believe everything I hear. I think what you -- when you're, when you're, when you're looking at this -- well, OK. What you, you have when you're, when you're looking at all of this and you're looking at the debate, you have to ask yourself one question. What issue do you care about most and will that allow you to accept the flaws of the candidates? So, for me, my issue will always be terror. So am I willing to accept the multitude of flaws that comes with the candidate who is strongest on terror? I think that is the question you have to ask yourself? What is the issue that matters to you most and will that allow you to overlook some pretty egregious stuff? I'm -- that's why so many people are on the fence because you say, I believe in this, but I can't handle that. And I think that's where a lot of people are.GUILFOYLE: Did you come off the fence?GUTFELD: Yeah. You know what? It's kind of comfortable now.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Exactly, you've --(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Well, green spot.GUTFELD: That is disgusting.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: I blame your influence on her. It's very untoward. All right, Bolling, so where -- what's the next step from here? I think they need to kind of close, loop on this, and move up of this topic. I wouldn't put somebody like Ivanka, who also is a tremendous asset to the campaign and to her father and the family. Maybe have her do something.BOLLING: Yeah. I think, I think Melania .GUILFOYLE: If the subject matter.BOLLING: . will hopefully put it to rest. I mean, when you see her speak and you feel her. You feel her emotions.PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: Now you realize all of these accusations that they are levying some of them (inaudible) they may all be true and they may not be, but unless you know for sure -- and I'm not talking about the tape that was released.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: I'm talking about the misconduct from years past. So the tape he's already apologized for she didn't -- she held his feet to the fire on that as well. My point is some of the accusations that aren't proven just yet, you see her and you see -- just somebody is being hurt by these things, and especially if they are not true, and the wife in this case, and the kids. And I know Chelsea Clinton, probably is hurt by some of the accusations on Bill Clinton, but these are people who, who come out and said that it's happened as well, too. So --PERINO: On questioning sexual assault accuser, questioning accusers of sexual -- who had made -- especially the women who had made sexual --GUILFOYLE: Allegations.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And questioning the veracity, and saying that they lives that according with the Clinton campaign is just political, they just want 15 minutes of fame, which is something they also said that also --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . very issue and we should not be doing that.BOLLING: No, no. I've been -- by no means did I simply said when she says - -PERINO: I know you did. I just think that --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: He's talking about the campaign.BOLLING: This is while you still, you feel her pain. You can see it in her face. She's pained by it.PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: Now, if all of this people -- if all this -- if there's proof and whatnot, then you can take a look back later --GUILFOYLE: She also did say, you can put it in a court of law, you know, and let people have their day in court, too, which I think is an important point. What do you think, Juan?WILLIAMS: She didn't move the ball and I don't think that anybody who watched it, and I think a lot of people have watched it. I think Ainsley did a fine job. So people watching, they're very interested. The question is, can you move this thing so that a lot of the republican women who may still be in Greg's awkward position offense-wise, say, you know, well, I can understand now and I feel -- but instead it came across as, well, she's being forced to sit there and say these things. She hasn't been out there. She's not convinced.PERINO: I can see it's not right --WILLIAMS: Just not persuasive.PERINO: I think she didn't look force.GUILFOYLE: I don't think she have look force at all. I mean, she -- I know her. She's a much stronger woman than that, so -- all right. It's been a great show, though, right?PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Straight ahead, did a top State Department official try to strike a quid pro quo deal with the FBI to get classification markings changed on Hillary Clinton's e-mail? The departments' answer to ""Fox News"" today,"" next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Welcome back. We are live in Las Vegas, ahead of tomorrow's final - - God, presidential debate and there is yet another twist in Hillary Clinton's e-mail saga. One of her top lieutenants at the State Department is accused of trying to make a quid pro quo deal with the FBI in the middle of its investigation of Clinton's private server. His name, Patrick Kennedy.GUTFELD: Ah!PERINO: The said files indicate that Kennedy asked the bureau to remark reclassify an e-mail in Clinton's archive. In exchange for the classification, an official says that Kennedy pledged his department would allocate more FBI agents to sensitive areas abroad. The State Department flat-out denies it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: We looked into this. The FBI looked into this, and it's just not true. There was no quid pro quo even suggested or any kind of bargain laid on the table. What did happen -- and this was -- what happened, though, is Pat Kennedy did talk to the FBI, as he did on other e-mail traffic that we were getting ready to release through FOIA, to discuss and try to better understand why they wanted something classified.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Did something illegal transpire? Well, here's Judge Napolitano.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS JUDICIAL ANALYST: It is a crime to offer a bribe, even if the bribe is not accepted. It's obviously not the crime of bribery. It's a crime of offering a bribe or attempt to bribe.A quid pro quo is a trade. ""I'll give you this tie for that tie."" The quid for the quo.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And here's the response from Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBBY MOOK, CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: It's very well known that there were disputes within the State Department and between -- rather, between agents -- between the State Department and other agencies about classification. It's -- it's not uncommon for officials within a department to fight over classification.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right. Eric, I see what they're trying to do, and I've been in similar positions in terms of explaining things that may look a little iffy. But if you're explaining in this campaign, you're losing.BOLLING: Especially when she said there -- I said no classified material. And the campaign must be out there going, ""Oh, no, look out, because look at what we tried to do or we actually did maybe have some classifications change.""Here's the $64,000 question. Why is the State Department not even -- he's not a high, high level State Department.PERINO: Pretty high level.BOLLING: But not at the top. Right? So next level down.PERINO: He's in the inner circle.BOLLING: Why would he be in charge of divvying up FBI jobs overseas? And then the FBI comes around, and they're the agency that's charged with finding out if the State Department did something wrong in all this. It's so incestuous. Is that right? Incestuous?GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: So incestuous, it's gross. It's what everyone hates about politics.PERINO: I do think that was within his realm of responsibility.BOLLING: Should it be is another one.PERINO: Well, I guess that's a question.Juan, are you guys worried on the Democratic side about all these WikiLeaks?WILLIAMS: No, I mean, most people are dismissive, especially on the Democratic side, because there's really -- there's been no headline out of the thing yet. This comes close and, in my mind, when I first heard about it, I thought, that is wrong when you have someone doing, as the judge described, what looks like a quid pro quo. And they weren't talking about jobs. They were talking about slots and bureaus overseas for FBI officials.But then I was taken -- taken aback when I saw that the State Department said flatly didn't happen, no offer was made and then, secondly, when I read that, in fact, the person that was on the other end at the FBI was not involved in the investigation, he was just -- and in fact, is now retired, it was not central. It was not in position to make any deal.PERINO: Their explanations are actually pretty good, Kimberly, but their headlines are terrible.GUILFOYLE: Their headlines are terrible, and it just really reinforces a belief that people have already about the collusion and corruption and underhandedness. It's unseemly, especially coming on the heels of the decision of Comey to say no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case and the e-mails. And then you see this and you say wait a second. So it is something worth consideration and further investigation between the two.I agree with Judge Napolitano, because it would be the crime of attempted bribery. There is, like, some evidence there to suggest that they should go delve a little bit further. What Eric Bolling is saying is you're asking them to police themselves. Of course, they're going to say, ""No, we didn't do anything."" So where's the oversight on that? So, you know, enter the hearing.PERINO: Chairman Chaffetz has already announced a hearing.GUILFOYLE: Exactly.PERINO: Greg, if the FBI needs more slots overseas to fight terrorism, shouldn't we just give them to them?GUTFELD: This is what I don't get. This is the weirdest bribe I've ever heard. Usually, you bribe for something fun, like a sports car or, I don't know, a mistress. But, no, it's a job in Iraq.By the way, this just goes to show you that Clinton -- the Clintons can corrupt anything. They could corrupt the Muppets. They could corrupt the Smurfs. They've corrupted FBI agents who are trying to fight -- fight terror.It just goes -- you know what the Clintons are like? They're like a big, giant, wet sheep dog that gets into the middle of an apartment full of people and just shakes, and everybody gets covered with it.PERINO: Everybody's covered.GUTFELD: Because whenever you get close to a Clinton, you come away stained.PERINO: All right. You leave the dog out.GUTFELD: I'm so hot. Do you know how hot I am?PERINO: How hot are you?BOLLING: Hotter than what?GUTFELD: I'm hotter than a...PERINO: Don't say it.As Donald Trump continues to make claims...GUILFOYLE: ... than a cat...PERINO: ... that the election is rigged. Carl Cameron caught up with him. We're going to have that next.Then later, we're joined by a man who's making ventriloquism cool again. Terry Fator joins us live ahead, along with the Republican nominee of sorts.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: We're live in Las Vegas ahead of tomorrow's final showdown between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Trump's in Colorado today -- a lot cooler there, I bet -- still expressing concern that he could be cheated out of victory in three weeks. Campaign Carl Cameron caught up with him on the trail yesterday and pressed Trump further.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: What evidence is there that you've seen that suggests that there's voter fraud under way now?DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, I am talking about past elections. I'm talking about recent elections but past, because that's the ones we have to judge by. And when you look at the voter fraud, when you look at illegal immigrants voting all over the country, when you look at people that died ten years ago. I mean, there's one person died 21 years ago, and that person is still voting.We have voters all over the country where they are not even citizens of the country, and they're voting. There's tremendous voter fraud, and how Republican leadership doesn't see that is beyond me.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: You know, Eric, this is a critical point for Republicans, because I see Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida; Pat Toomey, the senator from Pennsylvania. I see the head of the Republican Party, Ohio, North Carolina, many of these states, Republican election officials saying, ""Donald Trump, stop it. You're hurting confidence in American democracy.""BOLLING: I like the rigged part. I like the -- hey, this election is rigged. I hate the part that he's assigning to the voter fraud part of it. I like the part where he says the mainstream media, much of the media across the board is leaning towards Hillary Clinton.WILLIAMS: No, I heard that. But then he went back...BOLLING: I understand that.WILLIAMS: Pence and others said, ""Stop it, Donald.""BOLLING: I disagree with his -- where he's going with this. I think you stay on the fact that the media is rigged and it's leaning towards the other -- towards Hillary and giving her all the, you know, wind in her sails and nailing him down to everything he says. I think that's a winning strategy. The voter fraud stuff, I just don't get it.WILLIAMS: Kimberly, why do you think he's doing it?GUILFOYLE: I'm going to have to withhold my answer for ""The O'Reilly Factor."" We're going to do a whole segment on that. I think you're going to see all of the show, practically, on it, except Dana will be on with Megyn Kelly.WILLIAMS: What do you think?GUILFOYLE: I think there's been a lot of research and studies put into this and a lot of time. And there's some specific numbers. But overall, it doesn't bear out, in terms of the numbers, to say that there is...WILLIAMS: Right.GUILFOYLE: ... widespread voter or election fraud. There's also a separate section which would be the voter registration issue, so would you lump that all into one category.But I will tell you this. I think that it works with his supporters that they're worried about this, and maybe he's trying to do -- like a motivating factor to get them to show up, get the vote out, whatever he can do to say, ""Hey, listen, it's really important to make your vote count, because we could be facing a rigged, you know, election.But overall, I think it's not good for American democracy and our election system...WILLIAMS: Well, you know, in fact, Dana...GUILFOYLE: ... to undermine the outcome of the election.WILLIAMS: ... what I heard from some of the pros was, this actually suppresses voter turnout.PERINO: Yes, I was going to say, he might -- that might be his theory...GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: Thinking it will help motivate people. Could it actually make people say...GUILFOYLE: Give up.PERINO: ... well, then why go out to vote if they're going to already rig it.The other thing is, it really does go outside the bounds -- the four corners of the Constitution. I think what would be interesting, and we might hear about this in the coming days, if anyone's able to get some interviews or insights, is what's going on inside the Trump campaign, because you've had Pence, Chris Christie, people close to him, saying this is not actually true and he's doing it anyway, which I think means that he's cut the moorings. He's unshackled.WILLIAMS: He's unshackled. Greg, very quickly, he also says, ""Watch those minorities. They're going to cheat."" Is that a dangerous message?GUTFELD: Did he really say that?WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: I don't remember him saying that. But I know he said...PERINO: The inner city.GUILFOYLE: The inner city.GUTFELD: Watch the inner -- OK. So it was code. He was using code.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: I'd go back -- Kimberly kind of nailed it. This works with his supporters, but I don't think it's working with anybody else. I think maybe he's doing this to change the subject completely from what's been going on the next couple of weeks. You know?WILLIAMS: Could it be whining? Could it be whining, setting himself up?PERINO: It actually did kind of change the subject.GUTFELD: Yes, that's it.WILLIAMS: Stay right there, because up next, you're going to have so much fun. The star of one of the hottest shows in town is going to join us. Celebrity impersonator and ventriloquist Terry Fator, he added Trump to his Vegas show, and it's a huge hit. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: We're in Vegas for the last presidential debate and since we don't have time to see one of the shows on the strip, a show has come to us.Terry Fator is a headliner at the Mirage Hotel. He won season 2 of ""America's Got Talent."" He does it all, a ventriloquist, comedian and a singer, just like me.Welcome to ""The Five,"" Terry. I don't care about Terry. I want to talk to Donald. Donald, welcome to the show. Just check out your hands. Are your hands large, small, medium?TERRY FATOR, VENTRILOQUIST (AS DONALD TRUMP): They're just the right size, Greg.GUTFELD: Fantastic. Fantastic. So are you excited about the debate tomorrow?FATOR: I am so excited. I have been preparing 18 hours a day.GUTFELD: Really? What have you been doing?FATOR: In the tanning booth.GUTFELD: Very good. You're like -- you're like Eric.BOLLING: Hello. Thanks very much. It's all yours.FATOR: Oh!WILLIAMS: I've got a question for him. So Donald, such controversy with these women, how are you handling these accusations?FATOR: You know, it's not as bad as it sounds. I mean, just think about where this man's hand is right now.(as himself): Oh, OK. I don't know what to say.GUTFELD: Blame it on the dummy.FATOR: Of course.GUTFELD: We do that in a lot of shows.BOLLING: I have a quick question.FATOR: OK.BOLLING: To you, Terry.FATOR: Yes.BOLLING: Do you have a dummy named Hillary?FATOR: A dummy named Hillary? Actually, no, I don't. And I get that question a lot.PERINO: Not good for business?FATOR: Well, the thing is that...GUTFELD: It's redundant.BOLLING: As you said it.FATOR: The thing is -- and I get this question a lot. You know, Donald kind of transcends in politics. We've known about Donald all of our lives. The politic part of it, so you know, I didn't -- people said, ""Why didn't you do a George Bush? Why didn't you do an Obama?"" I did Donald because he's bigger than politics.If I did Hillary, it would all be about politics. With him, you know, it's just -- there's just so much more than just politics. So -- and the funny thing is, when I bring him out on the show, the crowd goes crazy.GUTFELD: Right. Of course.GUILFOYLE: They love it.FATOR: And I've written a routine that, whether you love Donald or hate Donald, you're going to laugh. It's all about laughter.GUTFELD: What are you going to do November 9?FATOR: We're going to rewrite the routine, whether he wins or loses.GUILFOYLE: Exactly.FATOR: He's still going to be in the show. In fact, we're writing a routine for him as Santa Donald for our Christmas show.GUILFOYLE: Love it.GUTFELD: Let me ask Donald -- go ahead, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Oh, I was just going to say, I wanted to ask Donald, why are you going to win this election? But before you answer, Donald, can you say hi to my little boy, Ronan? He's 10.FATOR (as Donald Trump): Hello, Ronan, you're 10 years old. You can be just like the Donald.GUTFELD: In 10 years you can date him.FATOR: No. All you need is a good wig. Sorry about this.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.PERINO: He's got a good head of hair. I love it.FATOR: Honey, I'll tell you why I'm going to win the election. I've got a plan. What we can do, we can get rid of the $20 trillion in debt. Mexico's going to pay for it.(as himself): OK. Well, that sounds good to me. I like it.GUILFOYLE: I love it.GUTFELD: Excellent. Excellent. So, I don't know what else to ask a dummy.PERINO: I want to ask you, like, what was it like to be on ""America's Got Talent,"" because I love that show.FATOR (as Donald Trump): Well, the voting was rigged.(as himself): OK. It was not rigged. It was a lot of fun. I got to say, I loved every second.PERINO: A lot of work?FATOR: It was a lot of work. They had us working from 5:30 in the morning...PERINO: Wow.FATOR: ... until like midnight, and I -- and I absolutely loved every second. I didn't -- I did not go in there planning to win. I went in there planning to have fun and just enjoy every moment of it. I did not think I was going to win. I thought I was just going to be on television. And it was an amazing experience.PERINO: You're great. We're glad to have you here.FATOR: Thank you.GUILFOYLE: Very fun. I love the hair, my God. Donald is fabulous.GUTFELD: Last question, what are you going to do your first day in office, Donald?FATOR (as Donald Trump): First day in office, I'm going to drone attack our enemy.BOLLING: Wow.PERINO: Which one?FATOR: CNN.GUTFELD: There you go.PERINO: Oh, my God. He's joking.FATOR (as himself): Joking.GUTFELD: It is a dummy, Dana. We know he's joking.PERINO: I was, too.GUTFELD: Thanks, Terry. All right. Catch him at the Mirage here in Las Vegas.""One More Thing"" up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: All righty. Time now for ""One More Thing"" from Las Vegas. Today, Juan starts.WILLIAMS: Well, since we're in Vegas, we've got to give you the celebrity news. And the celebrity news of the day is that Bob Dylan, who actually just was in town for a show can't be found by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee. The Swedish Academy has been unable to reach the singer to give him his Nobel Peace [SIC] Prize.The secretary for the academy said, ""I've called. I've sent e-mails and received friendly replies. For now that's not enough.""So though they've been in touch with his manager, Dylan refuses to respond. At the concert Monday in Vegas, he didn't even acknowledge his achievement. So he can refuse the $900,000 prize money.PERINO: Oh, my gosh.WILLIAMS: But guess what? He can't refuse the honor.PERINO: OK.BOLLING: Very good. Very good. All right, I'll go next. Listen, we're in Vegas, and if you don't know anything about Vegas, there are a lot of gun ranges in Vegas.Oh, is this hot? Is this hot? Did we roll the shot?PERINO: No...BOLLING: Anyway.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(ERIC SHOOTING AT SHOOTING RANGE)BOLLING: From my cold dead hands.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: AK semiautomatic, fully automatic tommy gun. That was in Las Vegas...PERINO: Did you love it?BOLLING: Thank you, Talia, producer.Yes, it was fantastic.GUILFOYLE: Nice, Bolling.PERINO: Wow. Look at that photograph. If you run for Congress, that will be front and center.BOLLING: Yes. All right. Dana, you're up.PERINO: Well, it's true. You could use it to your advantage.All right. So it's been quite a year. I love to read columnists in the morning. Richard Cohen is one of them that I read. And he talked about a crazy year that it's been for lots of reasons. One of them was Black Lives Matter and this issue of police and colors of community.Yesterday I saw something remarkable happen. Chief Terrence Cunningham of Wellesley, Massachusetts, Police Department, he's president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said this to everybody.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHIEF TERRENCE CUNNINGHAM, WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS: We must forge a path that allows us to move beyond our history and identify common solutions to better protect our communities. For our part, the first step in this process is for the law enforcement profession and the IACP to acknowledge and apologize for the actions of the past and the role that our profession has played in society's historical mistreatment of communities of color.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So I thought that was quite remarkable. And I'm sure that will be something we'll probably talk about in the future. Hopefully, things will get better on that score.And then I'm going to join the ranks of my co-hosts. On Thursday night I'm going to do a live book signing from my apartment with Jasper for the new book that's coming out next Tuesday, ""Let Me Tell You About Jasper."" So I don't know how that's going to go. I think it's the first time I've ever had a dog on.GUTFELD: It's going to be good.BOLLING: I'll tell you what.PERINO: ""I'll tell you what,"" what?BOLLING: It's going to be good.PERINO: It's going to be good, yes.GUILFOYLE: Is Peter going to be there?PERINO: Yes, I think Peter will be there.GUILFOYLE: OK, cool. What about Greg with flat Jasper?PERINO: No.GUTFELD: No.BOLLING: You're up, brother.GUTFELD: Boy, I'm sweaty. It's hot.GUILFOYLE: How hot are you?GUTFELD: I'm sweatier than a -- anyway. This happened at a diner. You know, that guy Tim Kaine? Here. He went to a diner, and then he was mistaken for somebody else.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA), VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Can I say hi?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, hello, Mr. Pence, how are you?KAINE: I'm the other one. I'm Kaine. I'm the other one.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.GUTFELD: Now, that shows you how dumb Tim Kaine is. If you're mistaken for your adversary, the first thing you do is say you are that person. Then you strip naked, and you run through the diner, screaming at people. You smear food all over your chest and your body and you roll on the table and you steal people's money. And then the news the next day is ""Pence loses his mind at a diner,"" and then -- and then it's a shoo-in.By the way, I am on ""O'Reilly"" tonight. And I'm going to be talking about this very same topic.GUILFOYLE: You might have been canceled after that.BOLLING: K.G. All you.GUILFOYLE: All right. And I'm going to be on before Greg.GUTFELD: I don't think so.GUILFOYLE: What?PERINO: You don't get canceled.GUILFOYLE: This is so cute. Yes, they don't cancel.Puppies replacing flowers at a wedding. Dana, you would like this. It's very sweet. So for most couples, right, it's all about the flowers, an important part of the day.PERINO: Aw.GUILFOYLE: But one couple is putting puppies in their place. Kathryn and Brad Ziemer used rescue puppies for their professional photos in place of the flowers. The couple was married at Rush creek Golf Club in Minneapolis.GUTFELD: What happens to the dogs after?GUILFOYLE: Excuse me. Supports Second-Hand Hounds, an organization that rescues dogs...GUTFELD: But what do -- after the wedding, where do they go?BOLLING: They're adopted.GUILFOYLE: Hopefully they're rescued and adopted.GUTFELD: Are you sure?BOLLING: They're party gifts.GUILFOYLE: We're going to...PERINO: Party gifts. Follow up on this.GUTFELD: What if they give the puppies back?BOLLING: Oh, my gosh.Who's giving that back? No one's giving that back.PERINO: No one.GUILFOYLE: My goodness. It's like a wag bag.PERINO: Come to the live signing.BOLLING: All right. That's it for us.PERINO: Well done, Eric.BOLLING: We did our best.GUILFOYLE: Get out while we can.GUTFELD: Sweaty.BOLLING: Las Vegas.GUTFELD: Very sweaty.BOLLING: A few hours before the final debate.
