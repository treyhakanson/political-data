This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president believes it is essential that we avoid these cuts. It is bad policy. The speaker himself says it is bad policy. It will go in to effect and those Americans will lose jobs because Republicans made a choice for that to happen.SEN. MAX BAUCUS, D - MT: The president is part of the sequester. The White House recommended it, frankly, back in August, 2011. So now we are feeling the effects of it. I don't want to say the president is solely to blame. He's not. It's both the president and Congress and basically the president and the speaker who put together this deal.REP. RANDY FORBES, R - VA: The president could have stopped it. The House of Representatives has passed not one, but two bills that would have stopped it. The Senate has done nothing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: That was Democratic Senator Max Baucus in the middle there. White House probably saying that wasn't too helpful in the talking points today as they are continuing to talk as we are nine days out from the sequester setting in, as we look at the big picture here, the sequester in the big picture, as you look at the budget overall -- $3.6 trillion budget and where the sequester is, $85 billion for this year, 2.4 percent.We've heard what the sequester would likely do. It is still a cut in spending growth. The government would still grow. But you've heard the president and you've heard Republicans talk about what could possibly happen.But here is a quote from the Washington Post about Democrats talking about this, quote, ""Democrats no longer see the sequester as sufficient to force Republicans to cave on new revenues; rather, they increasingly see the looming government shutdown deadline of March 27 as the real means for them to force a GOP surrender."" In other words, they are ready to fight another day.Let's bring in our panel, Tucker Carlson, editor of TheDailyCaller.com, A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK A.B., what is your take?A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: Well, I really hope that Douglas Holtz-Eakin and other experts are right that there is not going to be a considerable hit to consumer demand from the sequester. But I'm not feeling faithful about that. I think that the president's 11th hour urgency about the sequester is as disingenuous as the Republicans' sudden peace with it. Republicans have been passed two bills to replace the sequester. They have been telling us since July of 2011 the sky was going to fall.And it is not the amount of the overall budget that we're talking about. It is the way. $45 billion in defense cuts go to -- are going to be cut out of less than half of defense because so much is protected. It's the way that these cuts happen, 800,000 civilian employees today received e-mail saying you're going to have to look at upward at a nearly 20 percent pay cut. In some families that is going to - with two government workers with the domestic and defense spending, we are looking at two parents losing considerable pay this year. They will not be going to the beach on the Eastern seaboard this summer. They might not go to grandma's in Michigan. I hope this is going to go well.But if things get tough at shipyard back home and the pizzeria closes and so does the barbershop, congressmen are going to hear about this, after the budget fight of March, probably into late May or early June, and then they are going to have a long hot summer. And I don't know that we can sit here and say that this is going to be fine.I know the Republicans are hell-bent to letting this through. They say it is a make-or-break fight for them, and they will not back down. It's the only cuts they can pocket. So it is going through. And, by the way, there is no plan between March 1 and March 27 for these to be replaced. The Republicans don't have a plan in a file draw in the Capitol building. So I think it sounds awful and I hope I'm wrong.BAIER: Tucker, as far as the defense, national security issue, we are talking civilian employees here. And in the OMB, they have a report out about the ability to -- on national security issues. And here is what the report says, ""While the Department of Defense would be able to shift funds to ensure war fighting and critical military readiness capabilities were not degraded,"" saying that those things, in other words moving aircraft carriers would be OK, ""sequestration would result in a reduction in readiness of many non-deployed units, delays in investments in new equipment and facilities, cutbacks in equipment repairs, declines in military research and development efforts, and reductions in base services for military families.""  Go ahead.TUCKER CARLSON, EDITOR, THEDAILYCALLER.COM: Yes. This is clearly not the efficient way to cut government. On the other hand it would result in actual cuts. We are five years past one of the worst recessions in any of our lifetimes, and government has only grown. Meanwhile, the rest of the country has cut back. How many businesses have pared two percent of their operating budget over the past five years? Mine has, everybody's has.So just to put this in some perspective, it's not cataclysmic. I think the politics of it are pretty clear. I agree with A.B. that the president is disingenuous; he's not looking for a deal. He is looking for a fight. This is about the 2014 elections, this is about the belief on the part of some in the White House that they can win, they can take back the House. They'll divide Republicans by doing this. I also, finally agree that it is inevitable, that we will reach sequestration for sure.BAIER: Could somebody explain to me why Congress, why the president just doesn't say tomorrow, fine, transfer authority. Pentagon, you have transfer authority. You can do priorities. Take out of the conferences. You don't have to go to the stupid conference to do xyz. Save the personnel. Don't have the child care problem. Don't have the xyz proble. Have transfer authority for these agencies and don't make it an issue. Why don't they pass a bill tomorrow?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: That is precisely why this is the most ridiculously hyped Armageddon since the Mayan calendar. In fact it's made - it looks worse than the Mayan disaster.This, as you say, can be solved in a day in an hour by allowing a transfer of funds. It's incredibly soluble, easily soluble. And the president is the one who ought to propose it. He won't, of course, because he is looking for a fight and not a solution.But secondly, look at this in perspective. In terms of the gross domestic product of our economy this is .03 of -- it's a third of one percent on the domestic side, well overall it's 2.5 cents on the dollar. And overall on the non-defense side it is a penny-and-a-half on the dollar of reductions.  Here we are with a debt of $16 trillion and the argument today is that if we cut a penny-and-a-half on non-defense spending in one year it's going to be the end of the world. If so, then we are hopelessly in debt and we're going to end up like Greece --BAIER: I want to continue this conversation, call an audible here, and talk about sequestration and this transfer authority question, about why that's not happening on both sides, when the panel continues after the break.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

 Politics of Presidential Primary Calendar 
"	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" March 31, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAREN FLOYD, SOUTH CAROLINA GOP CHAIRMAN: If Florida doesn't respect the process by which our primary calendar was set the RNC should not be bound to the process by which the convention site was selected.(END VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR: Talk about the political hardball. That is South Carolina GOP chair Karen Floyd on a conference call today saying if Florida insists on breaking party rules and holding its primary next January, then Republicans should take their national convention away from Florida.And we're back now with the panel. So, A.B., the RNC set some rules early on, they said only the first four. Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, could go in February. Everybody else had to go later. The idea is to start later in the season, and not have this big jumble and now Florida is talking about -- we're going to go in January, which means that everybody else would go even earlier in January. How big a deal is this?A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: It's a very big deal. Florida is obviously a heavyweight state in the process and feels that it can position itself with the support of Senator Marco Rubio and others, to say we're going to jump the calendar. And no matter what you say it doesn't matter.But really, this is such an indication, what a disaster it would be if the RNC tried to take the convention away from Florida, at this point, to punish them for breaking these rules. This is the kind of thing that should have been worked out in advance. Finding a way to make the states -- to compel them to comply with these rules, really should have been done earlier. And it's an illustration of how weakened the RNC has become in a party that's leaderless. It really needs a highly functioning RNC. And this has become a huge liability.WALLACE: Now, A.B. said, well boy it would just be terrible if they took the convention away from Tampa. -STODDARD: Now?WALLACE: They've already signed millions of dollars in contracts. I mean this is a pretty empty threat, isn't it?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: It's a completely empty threat. If you want to be a party that says it should be in control of the White House and the country, and the trillion dollars budget -- a $4 trillion budget and you can't even get your ducks in a row to put on a show next year and you take it away from Tampa and you disappoint one of the most important states in the country, you haven't exactly made a good case for yourself.There is no way that is going to happen. What will probably happen is what happened last time around, they will try to cut the number of delegates in half. And then after it's all over, everybody will be forgiven and it will be allowed, the full number will be allowed. There is no way to stop this, unless the Florida party comes to its senses, and there is no indication of that right now.WALLACE: Well there is some talk, I must say, I think it's the speaker of the - Republican speaker in Florida who's saying, well, maybe we'd settle for going fifth. So maybe this is a way to rush not ahead of the first four but to ensure that they go fifth.Let me switch to the other interest subject involving Republicans, Steve, and that is debates. The first debate is gonna be five weeks from tonight in South Carolina, Greenville, South Carolina, the Republican GOP debate on Fox News. But now the RNC is saying, gosh, there are so many different organizations, news organizations, other organizations, maybe we've got try to get control of this and limit the number of debates.STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yeah, I think the RNC wants to limit the number of debates. I think, the front-runners, or the repudiated front-runners would like to limit the number of debates. Like Mitt Romney, who doesn't have to take shots from 20 candidates on the stage 20 times before the nomination actually unfolds.And I actually think that the debate question in terms of the RNC is a little less significant than the delegate question -- than the Florida question. Because I agree with Charles. I think it's unlikely that the RNC can really do much, aside from make phone calls and try to persuade Floridians to change it. So I think that is going to be a bigger sticking point for the Republicans.WALLACE: A.B., take us inside the campaigns and Steve touched on this, but which candidates want more debates starting earlier and which candidates want fewer debates starting later?STODDARD: The candidates who are considered sort of the outer tier want more notoriety and they want to get in there and start punching. Someone like Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, they're going to be interested in these debates, maybe Donald Trump, Herman Cain.And then you look at the other governors who are working to establish serious candidacies, Tim Pawlenty, Mike Huckabee, Haley Barbour, I don't know about Mitch Daniels at this point. But they really are gonna want to wait to see how the field settles and they're gonna want to have debates maybe later after some of the low-hanging fruit is gone.And I see the argument for an abbreviated debate season. But it's again, another thing the RNC really can't control and if they wanted to, they should have thought about it a little bit earlier in the season.WALLACE: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: It shows you how weak our parties are compared to a Canada or a U.K. where this would never happen. In those the parties it's all top-down. Ours are completely, sort of anarchic. And particularly the RNC, if you don't have the White House, the party is weaker than ever. I agree. I think the best way to alienate the electorate is to have 20 debates in the year before the election, which is a way to expose all of the foibles and the weaknesses, particularly of the ones who will probably end up as the most likely nominees.It's the fringe candidates who are going to be provocative and aggressive as a way to get notice and attention. The best example of that is Huckabee, who in the last round was thought to be extremely unlikely and ended up in the top tier. That is the objective of every one of the minor candidates.And what is going to happen major ones, the ones who have the best shot will be taking hits for 20 debates over a year. It's not going to help the party.WALLACE: That is it for panel. By the way, did I mention that the first debate is right here on Fox on May 5?Stay tuned to see the shocking video of what twin babies are really saying when they don't know someone is watching.Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC.

2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2013/02/22/sequester-real-crisis-politics-usual-or-both/	The sequester: Real crisis, politics as usual ... or both?	" This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" Feb. 21, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: The sequester, real crisis or politics as usual, or both? Karl Rove joins us. Nice to see you, Karl.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR/FORMER BUSH SENIOR ADVISOR: Greta, good to see you.VAN SUSTEREN: OK, Karl, is this a real crisis for the nation, or is this just politics as usual or both?ROVE: It's a crisis in this regard. We're talking about cutting 2.3 percent out of this year's budget. This year's budget is bigger than last year's. So we're not -- it's not like we're cutting below what we spent last year, but we are taking 2.3 percent of this year's budget and cutting it.Now, that's $85 billion out of a $3.554 trillion budget. That is a -- that's $35,540 billions of, and we're trying to cut $85 billion out. If we can't do that, we're in real trouble and -- because we have a huge spending problem in this country and we've got to start somewhere.Now, look, I don't want to underestimate how difficult this is in the middle of a fiscal year. It's one thing to do it before you begin the fiscal year, say, Next year, we're going to -- we were planning to spend, you know, $3.5 trillion and we're going to spend $85 trillion or $85 billion less.It's another thing to be in the middle of the year and cut it. But we better start cutting from the future growth of spending, restrain it, rein it in. Otherwise, these deficits are going to suffocate our country. They're already harming our growth. I love it -- the president and his people say we need to keep spending, we need to keep running up these deficits, otherwise the economy's going to be in difficulty.Well, look, we've tried that for four years and our economy has not been on fire. It's the worst recovery in the recorded history of the United States. And our job creation -- we're still not back to the point that we were in 2007, when the country went into a recession. We have not been able to spend our way to prosperity, and the idea that we can continue that -- that philosophy is just mistaken.VAN SUSTEREN: You know, I don't have any sympathy when you say it's harder to do in the middle of the year because the first thing I think of is, Tough. They're the ones who got themselves into this. This is the one -- they're the ones who got into this idea. It's the president's suggestion, although, you know, I know there's been some question he's tried to duck that, but his suggestion. The Republicans went along with it, and it's only because it's the middle of the year because they kept pushing it off. So I sort of feel like, Tough.ROVE: Right.VAN SUSTEREN: They asked for the job. They paid for it. They have profoundly failed us in resolving this. Don't have any sympathy that it's hard.ROVE: You can't resolve this without presidential leadership, and the president for 18 months has not been interested in a solution. Now, let's -- let's -- let's do, though, put this in a little bit of a context. We're talking about cutting $85 billion. That's 2.3 percent of the federal budget.Now, the problem is this. The sequester as designed by the White House said we're not going to take anything out of mandatory spending, which is 65 percent of the budget. We're going to cut everything that we're going to cut out of the discretionary part of the budget, which is 35 percent of the budget. So the 2.3 is not out of the whole, it's out of a part, which means that, in reality, we're cutting discretionary spending by about 7 percent.Now, we're doing it in the last seven months of the fiscal year, and we're doing it across the board, a haircut. The sequester mandates that it be across the board. So important things are cut just as deeply as unimportant things.And look, this problem's going to get worse unless we figure out a way to do this smarter because over the next decade, the CBO forecasts that discretionary spending will shrink to 29 percent of the budget and mandatory will grown to 71. And the sequester is the first step. This $85 billion is the first of $1.2 trillion in cuts that are supposed to take place over the next decade, and we're increasingly going to be cutting them out of the part of the budget that is voted upon every year, the discretionary part, and not out of the mandatory, which is what's been put on autopilot, and you know, that's just, making it more and more difficult for us to cut.There's a way out of this, and the Republicans in the House, in my opinion, ought to take the lead on it. I want you to think about this. This has got a cut -- across-the-board cut. Everything gets cut -- 7 percent of discretionary spending gets cut, 2.3 percent of the overall budget. We need flexibility so that the individual cabinet members say, I'm going to prioritize the important things and cut less out of them, and the unimportant things cut more.And that way, we're going to be able to do this in a more smart fashion than we're now doing with this across-the-board haircut in everything. It's one thing to say we're going to cut everything by 1 percent, but if you're talking about 7 percent, then you start cutting -- you know, you cut things that are really important and cut an equal amount of things that are less important.VAN SUSTEREN: Is there anything to prevent the politicians here in Washington from agreeing on some resolution, sequestration, some spending cut, whatever formula they come up with, and then they come up to the microphones and they say, you know, This is great. We have, you know, bipartisan, or whatever, and put whatever people behind them to sort of impress us that this is (INAUDIBLE) and then next year, turn around and increase spending anyway?ROVE: Well, the actions of one Congress can't bind a future Congress, and that's why we have to have people in the House and Senate who are committed to the long-term reform of our budget process because, yes, you're right. We cut $85 billion this year. There's no guarantee that people in future years are going to follow through with it, especially as long as this president is in office.Remember, this was his idea. He thought it was a great idea. And now he says it's brutal and arbitrary and wants it revoked. He once threatened to veto any bill that came to him that tried to stop or overturn the sequester.But we -- and this is the irony. Republicans would be smart to give the president the flexibility so that it's not an across-the-board haircut. Each department has to cut an amount equal to 2.3 percent of the overall budget or 7 percent roughly of discretionary income, has to cut that total amount, but it has flexibility to pick and choose among the programs inside that department, some of which will be cut more and some that'll be cut less.VAN SUSTEREN: If the Republicans don't agree to that flexibility, is it then the Republicans are then going to be, you know, and probably justifiably so, just being -- gaming the president? I mean -- I mean, if that's not working towards the solution -- if flexibility to sort of pick and choose what makes sense to cut and what doesn't -- if the Republicans deny the president who won the election that ability to do that, is that just about winning?ROVE: No. First of all, the president has not asked for it. The president's not asked for it. I think it's smart for the Republicans to give it to him so he can no longer blame them. If he says, We're going to cut meat inspectors, they say, Look, you can find something better at the Department of Agriculture to cut than meat inspectors, can't you, Mr. President?Air traffic controllers are going to be cut. Mr. President, at the Department of Transportation, can't you find something that's not as important that you could really cut so you keep those important personnel? Oh, you're going to cut border patrol people? Isn't there something at Homeland Security that's less important, something that you can hold off a little while?So look, the Republicans would be smart to give him flexibility. It would give him more power. He's going to gore a couple of the oxen that Republicans like. But the Republicans also have another important tool. I was e-mailing back and forth today with a really smart Republican strategist who said oversight. The House Republicans could call up any cabinet secretary who says, OK, well, I'm going to take -- I'm going to close the Washington Monument, rather than, you know, cutting off the GSA conferences with people -- and remember the famous photographs of the GSA administrator...VAN SUSTEREN: Boy, I sure do!ROVE: ... in a bathtub with his glass of red wine. Yes, who's going to -- that's going to -- we all need therapy in order to overcome that image. But you know, that's the kind of thing that oversight will allow the Republicans in the House to say, Wait a minute, Mr. President. You threatened that ag -- that ag meat inspectors would be taken away. Well, here are some really -- you know, some programs at the Agriculture Department that are not as important.Or, you know, let me give you the classic example. We have this program that takes -- you know, gives money to people for free cell phones, and already we've gotten government reports from the agencies and from the agency itself saying that it's rife with fraud and abuse. Well, maybe we ought to be cutting that program before we cut other things that are more important.So the Republicans have a one-two punch. Give the president flexibility so the cabinet secretaries can pick and choose between accounts, take more out of the less important accounts, keep the important accounts, the important parts of the budget intact, and then have oversight so they can blow the whistle on any, you know, phony money kind of president PR gimmicks that these cabinet officials are undertaking in order to try and blame them for it.VAN SUSTEREN: And Karl -- and I -- I just want to point out that picture, if you take a good look at it -- that guy in the bathtub, he didn't even have two matching wine glasses. So we paid all that money, he couldn't even get two matching wine glasses.But anyway, I'm taking the last word on that one. Thank you, Karl.ROVE: Thank you, Greta."

If so, then we are hopelessly in debt and we're going to end up like Greece --BAIER: I want to continue this conversation, call an audible here, and talk about sequestration and this transfer authority question, about why that's not happening on both sides, when the panel continues after the break.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

 Inside the politics of rising gas prices 
"	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" March 8, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVEN CHU, ENERGY SECRETARY: According to the Obama administration, the p roduction of petroleum liquids in the United States have increased now -- I believe it's the highest it's been in over eight years.REP. STEVE SCALISE, R - LOUISIANA: We've seen just from 2010 to 2011 an 11 percent reduction in oil production on federal lands. In the Gulf of Mexico, exclusive ly, we have seen 17 percent reduction in oil production. Where the increase has come is on private lands.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, a battle over energy up on Capitol Hill. On the Senate side Senate Republicans proposed an amendment to take the decision of the Keystone XL pipeline away from the president, give it to a federal agency and approve that pipeline. The president made personal calls to Democrats, lawmakers, to lobby against this. These are the Democrats who voted against this amendment, it did end up failing, not -- didn't get the 60 votes needed to pass. And the House speaker weighed in on that lobbying effort.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JOHN BOEHNER, R - OHIO, HOUSE SPEAKER: I don't know how the president can say I'm for an all-of-the-above energy strategy and then lobby against the Keystone pipeline which is supported by almost 70 percent of the American people. His actions are not matching up with the rhetoric that he is using. And the fact is the president wanted to blame us for blocking the Keystone pipeline, and here it is, the president himself, personally calling senators asking them to vote against this amendment in the Senate today.JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president obviously has communications with members of Congress with some regularity.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Wasn't too much more from the White House on the efforts, the phone calls. We're back with the panel. What about this issue overall, Steve? How is this playing out?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, it's a huge issue both in terms of the substance of it, in terms of what we're seeing with gas prices but also in terms of the politics of it. If you just think of what we've seen over the last couple of days on the presidential campaign trail, you've got Newt Gingrich releasing a 30-minute video on this. You've got his podium with a gas pump on it. He was visiting a gas station. Rick Santorum shortly before we came on air sent out a tweet about it, he mentions gas prices in his speeches. Mitt Romney just gave a speech in front of an oil rig. This is something Republicans see it as a great vulnerability for the White House, and I think they should. The fact that the President of the United States was making calls to lobby Democratic senators came because he was worried that this could actually pass and he would look weak, and it would put him in a bit of a pickle. The fact that he was making those calls, though, I think up-ends the White House's argument that they are not politically responsible.BAIER: Jeff?JEFF ZELENY, NEW YORK TIMES: I think that if you talk to the president's advisors, one of the top concerns, at least domestically, is gas prices. So optically it doesn't look that great for the White House right now that he is sort of trying to step in front of this. The bigger problem for this a lot of the highest gas prices are coming in swing states where Democrats need to win, where his re-election is going to be on the line, like Ohio and Pennsylvania. So this is a big worry for the White House. And it should be.BAIER: Well you have also some Democrats on that list that we put up earlier for re-election in swing states, Claire McCaskill voting against this effort.MARY KATHARINE HAM, THE DAILY CALLER: The issue of why the gas prices are high is complex. The issue of whether it's a huge political issue is simple. And he will take flak for it. And people who are charge will take flak for it. And when people look at the situation and they see the energy secretary saying it is not our goal to get gas prices down, he said some things in 2008 that sort of reinforced that for people and they see the energy secretary doling out all these huge loans for alternative energy that end up very obviously failing, and then they see this sort of no-brainer in Keystone and the president actively lobbying against it, I think it makes a difference for people.BAIER: It is important to note that oil prices are complex. It's a world commodity. There are a lot of different factors, it's not just supply, it's not just demand. There is world supply issues and world demand issues. But on the simple term, who is winning this back and forth politically?HAYES: I think politically there is no question that Republicans are winning it. In part they are making -- everything you just said there is true about the way that oil is priced. However, it doesn't mean that the United States and the U.S. government in particular, can't do anything to affect those prices. If you look what President Bush did back in July 2008 when he lifted the moratorium in the east and west outer continental shelf you saw gas prices come down 12 percent over 45 days. That's not insignificant.What happens is you've got betting on the future supply of oil. People make those bets based on what signals they are getting from the administration. When an administration signals that it's not interested in increasing supply on something that is as simple as this that does affect prices.BAIER: Speculators factor in, oil companies and their big picture factor in, but the whole supply and demand question is really interesting. Secretary Chu today, Jeff, up on Capitol Hill saying, yes, when you release the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the prices did go down, and then conceding that supply does matter. The President has talked about demand and lowering demand.ZELENY: Right. And he mentioned in his White House press conference earlier this week that the administration is looking at some other options. So my guess is that they will do something in the months forward. But the simple reason he is losing the argument is because he is the incumbent. It is his problem. He made the exact argument against President Bush against Republicans when he was running for president, and now it's coming back at him. It's as simple as that.BAIER: That is it for the panel. But stay tuned, a head-to-head political match-up.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
