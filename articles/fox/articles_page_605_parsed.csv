When you bring things to the public that prove they do not follow said policy protocol they simply say  -- oops, it did occur but we have done nothing wrong.'""BLM says it has taken steps to prevent a similar incident -- and will no longer deal with Davis.The U.S. Attorney's office declined to proceed with any civil or criminal charges.Material SupportThe U.S. military has spent about $470 million supporting Afghan Local Police Units -- with another $420 million expected to be spent through 2018.But an Inspector General questions whether it is money well spent.Quote -- ""supplies ordered for the ALP are often diverted -- delayed -- of inferior quality -- or heavily pilfered.""Politics have also come into play.Quote -- ""Some ALP personnel have been used inappropriately as bodyguards for Afghan government officials.""The IG calls for the oversight of U.S. funds to be improved -- and a plan for the future transition -- sustainment-- or dissolution of the police units.Up in SmokeFinally -- Arkansas' legalized marijuana push may be undone in part -- by poor grammar.The state's Attorney General rejected a ballot proposal to legalize marijuana -- citing numerous issues -- including sloppy drafting -- quote --""Amending the Arkansas Constitution is a serious matter that merits greater attention to detail than evidenced by the proposal -- which contains several errors of spelling and syntax that tend to obscure its meaning. I urge you to review the proposal carefully to locate and correct such errors in the event you redesign and resubmit the proposal."""	[]	[]

"DISCLAIMER: THE FOLLOWING ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" CONTAINS STRONG OPINIONS WHICH ARE NOT A REFLECTION OF THE OPINIONS OF FOX NEWS AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS INVESTMENT ADVICE WHEN MAKING PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS. IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.Exchange on 'Black Lives Matter' at Democratic Debate Fuels New DiscussionMichelle Fields:  I think it's ridiculous that here in America ""All Lives Matter"" has become politically incorrect.  Yes there are lots of blacks who are suffering here in America.  There are also lots of Asians, Caucasians, Latinos who are suffering, Veterans of all races and ethnicities.  We need a president who is going to care about each and every one of the American people and to work to try to make things better for them.  Not just saying, these people matter, these people don't matter. Juan Williams:  There's been a huge movement about excessive use of force by police against black people.  That's what the black lives movement is about.  We've seen huge protests around the country.  We know what happened in Ferguson, Staten Island.  I can go on and on.  But in terms of the answer, my feeling is, the Black Lives movement needs to get rid of this issue, draw a broader coalition together by simply saying, yes, all lives matter but we got to do something about the use of excessive force by police.Jonathan Hoenig:  I think Carly Fiorina got it right this week.  All individuals matter.  We're a country of individuals, not racial tribes.  The left is so obsessed with collectivism.  Only groups matter to them.  Racial groups, gender groups, economic groups and I'm sorry but to treat all people as a member of a particular tribe, just because they happen to be the same race, is racist in my book.Jessica Tarlov:  Of course all lives matter, but the Black Lives Matter movement is making a very specific point that needs to be put out there.  They're not necessarily doing it in the most effective way all the time, some of their tactics I think are completely wrongheaded.  But it doesn't meant that they don't have a point.Wayne Rogers:  It is spreading, and there is no reason for it.  The whole thing about ""Black Lives Matter"" started as a rallying cry and then they made more out of it and it's just stupid.  It's just silly.  All lives matter, every life matters.Fight Breaks Out at Trump Rally; Campaign Wants Secret Service ProtectionWayne Rogers:  They should be protected, of course.  Look we've had people shot who were running for president.  We've had presidents shot.  Somebody can shoot somebody.   It doesn't matter whether they're running for president or about to run for president.  Yes, they should be protected.Jonathan Hoenig:  This is one exact reason why we need to get money in politics to pay for these types of things.  When it comes to Trump, I think that this exemplifies what I consider to be cronyism.  He's so rich, but no, the taxpayer should pay for his security.  If he's self-funding his campaign, why doesn't he pay for his security?Michelle Fields:  I think that taxpayers ought to pay if it's the front runner, and there's a direct threat to the person's life.  The argument that Trump was making was that maybe this was partisan politics.  He said that he has not been offered Secret Service protection.  The Department of Homeland Security said, ""Well he hasn't put in a formal request yet, so that's why we haven't given it to him.   With Obama, he put in a request and there was racist rhetoric and that's why we gave him Secret Service.""  But Donald Trump has had a direct threat to his life, we're talking about El Chapo.  The huge Mexican Cartel is going after him.Jessica Tarlov:  I think Donald Trump should have Secret Service protection.  Obama got it so early because of the racially motivated threats.  Going against what Jonathan said about putting more money into politics.  Why don't we federally finance campaigns, make them six weeks or three months.  We wouldn't have to do this dance for two years ahead.  The big donors like the Koch brothers, Tom Steyer, they can put their money into the causes that matter and not into candidates.Juan Williams:  Presidential lives matter.  I would err on the side of caution.  I just don't think you want people being hurt.  A lot of the videos we saw, Bernie Sanders being on the stage, or protestors in the Trump crowd, that's minor stuff.  We're talking about, as Michelle was saying, serious threats against their life.Nevada Bans Fantasy Sports Sites; Says They Need Gambling LicenseJuan Williams:  This is pure gambling.  I don't understand why there is any confusion.  This has always been gambling and Las Vegas, Nevada is exactly right.  This should be regulated.Jonathan Hoenig:  It seems like in a free country, with free choice, you have the freedom to use your mind, to rationally use it or not rationally use it.  Whether it's using drugs, or gambling, or undertaking risky business ventures, as long as you're not impacting other people's lives, it not only should be legally, it is morally legal.  Gambling included.Michelle Fields:  The reason they were able to get away with this was because of an exception.  They said that people won according to skill not chance.  I think this is all about control.  I think they just want more control over this, they didn't have any regulations, and now they want to just have control of it.Wayne Rogers:  I say that it doesn't matter because the people who are going to gamble are going to gamble whether there is a gaming law.  Look at all of the gambling that goes on outside of the law for god sake.  It's just stupid.Jessica Tarlov:  The world we're moving more towards Internet based for everything.  This is going to be an issue going forward, so I think it's good that we're talking about it.  I'm not sure if I'm for regulation or letting it be."	['Sanders', 'Black', 'Trump', 'Obama']	['god']
