This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, the Republican race for the White House hitting a critical new stage. Over the next eight days we may learn more about the eventual nominee than we have since this all started 11 months ago.Good evening and welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly.  Tonight your guide to this decisive next stretch, the Republican race taking on a furious pace accelerating from the first three contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to an increasingly national race.  Playing out in states across this country. Tomorrow the candidates square off in the Nevada caucuses. Wednesday they go face-to-face with the voters and yours truly in a ""Kelly File"" town hall broadcast from Queensbury Theater in Houston, Texas.Then on Thursday, the contenders debate for the final time. Five days before the most significant day on the election calendar to debate to date.  It's not the last debate. Fox News has got one on March 3rd. Tuesday March 1st is Super Tuesday. Voters in 13 states from Georgia, to Texas, to Massachusetts, all head to the polls. Nearly one quarter of all the delegates at stake are up for grabs.We have a powerful panel tonight to take you through all of this. Chris Stirewalt, Charlie Hurt and Steve Hayes are here. But first we begin with Chief Political Correspondent Carl Cameron, who is on the ground in Las Vegas, Nevada where voting starts in about 24 hours. Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Megyn. It's Vegas baby. And judging from the body blows and head shots in the last day-and-a-half, you would think that there is a prize fight by tomorrow night on the trip. Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are just going at it. Donald Trump has a sizable lead in what little polling there's been here, a little run-up to the Nevada caucuses. He is favored to win. He's got a hotel here, he would be then the winner of three of the first in the nation four states having won New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.  Now, having said that, what may even be more interesting is the battle that will play out tomorrow between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.Cruz today had on fire a staffer. He had been on defense for quite some time. Marco Rubio called him out, wanted to make the point that there was an event over the weekend, another one of this supposed dirty trick and that it was a record really of Ted Cruz with too many deceitful underhanded political tactics. And that will be in some way resolved tomorrow with this exception, Megyn. The Nevada caucuses don't have much history, they've only been to prior to this in the turnout with seven percent and 12 percent. Tomorrow's turnout is expected to be 10 percent, that's about 50,000 votes total, maybe as many as 70,000. But still a small number and now the battle has so escalated that as you said, Super Tuesday, the upcoming debates and what happens this week are very, very important as Marco Rubio tries to coalesce a lot of the establishment mainstream Republicans and Cruz tries to get off defense, and get back on offense against Trump -- Megyn.KELLY: Carl Cameron, thank you.Joining me now for more, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor. Charlie Hurt who is a political columnist for The Washington Times. And Steve Hayes who is a Fox News contributor and senior writer for The Weekly Standard. Good to see you all.So, Chris, you say this next week is actually a make-or-break week for Ted Cruz in particular. Why?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, Ted Cruz was believed to be the kind of Iowa winner, the kind of evangelical favorites that could do what the ones in the past had and in 2008, 2012, there was this thing that happened, Iowa picked a guy and then he lost in the stretch run. This time Cruz looked like he was going to be different. He had infrastructure, he had lots of money, he had billionaire backers. And he had large national name identity. However, going forward, it has been too bad contest for him.And the one in South Carolina was particularly unfortunate for Senator Cruz because he did not do well with people he needed to do well with. He lost the evangelicals to Trump. He lost in places, he came in behind Rubio in places that should have been breadbaskets for him. And this is a troubling sign, he needs a win or his campaign is going to lose steam quickly.  KELLY: Well, if he gets a big win in Texas, he's in very good stead. I mean, that's a lot of delegates available for him potentially. Steve, what about this dustup that he had. Cruz fired his communications guy, Rick Tyler. And, you know, basically said, I'm not running that kind of campaign. Some people came out and said it's too harsh. Rubio came out and essentially said, you need to look inward, Ted Cruz. How does this play out?STEVE HAYES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I don't think it actually makes the charges go away. I mean, I think that was what they were trying to do is put this behind them by firing Rick Tyler, essentially scapegoating Rick Tyler and saying, now that he's gone, all the problems will be gone. He hasn't been the source of their problems. I think there have been other questions raised by their candidates, by other news outlets that Cruz has yet to answer. And I think that is what will continue to dog him as he goes forward.  KELLY: But aren't we pretending that the other campaigns are squeaky clean?(LAUGHTER)HAYES: No, no, no, no.KELLY: Cruz is the only one who's resorted to anything on tour --  HAYES: No, no. Absolutely not. No, I mean, look, if you go back and you look at the exit polling in South Carolina, Donald Trump's campaign was judged to have been the most unfair of the campaigns. And certainly Marco Rubio, you can tell just by his response, the statement that they put out responding to the firing of Rick Tyler by Ted Cruz was tough, was a tough response, he said basically it's not about Rick Tyler, it's about Ted Cruz and the lies start from the top. So, no, they're all playing dirty. The question is I think, who is able to put those charges and allegations behind him in a way that lets him move forward and gain a pool of the voting -- Republican voting electorate.  KELLY: So, Charlie, right now the race is Trump's to lose. I mean, he's well positioned not only in Nevada. I mean, the polling there is bad apparently and weird. I would want to look at my notes. In a 2008 Republican caucuses, the polling average gave Mitt Romney a five-point advantage over John McCain, Romney wound up winning by 38 points.(LAUGHTER)So, they don't poll so well in Nevada. They do other things really well.  But the polling is not as great. So, it's Trump to run away with including on March 1st Super Tuesday. And then as we move forward to March 15th.  What does he need to do? Right? Because does he play it straight? Does he not mess it up? Or does he just be himself and keep saying, you know, the incendiary things which have worked so well for him thus far.  CHARLIE HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES POLITICAL COLUMNIST: Well, I think that for the time being, Megyn, that, you know, Donald Trump is going to continue to be Donald Trump, although I do think I could foresee, you know, as soon as, you know, Super Tuesday. We start seeing some modulation of that, some toning it down a little bit to go forward. Because at some point, he does need to sort of answer some of the questions that a lot of people are asking about it, whether its presidential to say some of the things that he said on, you know, on stage and in public.But I think that the real -- I agree with what Chris said earlier, you know, the real -- the real person who has all his chips on this race, and he's flooding Nevada is Ted Cruz, because you cannot lose the evangelical vote. If that's your strategy, you cannot lose the evangelical vote to Donald Trump in South Carolina. And yes, you're right. He does have Texas and he should win Texas. He's only a handful of points in the latest polls above Donald Trump there, but you cannot build a winning Republican primary campaign on just your home state and Iowa.  KELLY: Chris, what about Kasich and Carson? I mean, who does it hurt?  And who does it help that they remain in this race?STIREWALT: Trump. It helps Trump. Of course it helps Trump. Because all Donald Trump needs to be the Republican nominee is for nothing to change.  He needs things to stay exactly as they are and he will become the Republican nominee.KELLY: Uh-hm.STIREWALT: What he needs to not happen is for Kasich and Carson to follow Jeb Bush's lead and go, because their vote share is much more likely to go to Rubio than anybody else's, of anybody at all, and for Cruz, the question is, how much of that vote is available to Trump and how much is available to Rubio. We don't know until we get there. But for Trump, the coalescing of the field is the problem.  KELLY: Before I let you go, Steve. You have any doubt that Trump is going to win Nevada unhandily tomorrow night?HAYES: No, I mean, if I were placing bets, that's where I would do it. On the other hand, if you look at past caucuses, the candidates with the best ground operations who spent the most time there, have cultivated their supporters, often surprised. So, I wouldn't be surprised with anything at this point.  KELLY: This is the real candidate casino, not like the fake candidate casino, you guys play a special which I love. Great to see you all.(LAUGHTER)STIREWALT: You bet.KELLY: Well, my next guest is a veteran campaign adviser who has seen it all when it comes to running for president. He is featured prominently in an amazing new political documentary over on Showtime, it's a series called ""The Circus."" And it follows campaigns real time and then you see sort of the summation on show time. Watch this clip, where we will see or guest Mark McKinnon greeting his old boss, George W. Bush on the campaign trail in South Carolina.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's kind of a high noon/ok corral aspect to all this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello, captain. How are you?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're looking great.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good to see you. I appreciate it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm listening to ""put me in coach"".  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, yes. Yes, sir. That's our theme song.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good to see you, how does it feel? Reporting for duty?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, reporting for duty.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How nice to see you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States, George W. Bush.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you. I understand that Americans are angry and frustrated, but we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration. We need someone who can fix the problems, so please welcome a man I am proud to call my big little brother, Jeb Bush.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)JEB BUSH, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I ask for your support next Saturday. I ask for your prayers for our family. God bless you all.  Thank you very much for coming.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bringing out -- bringing out the whole Bush family.  You know, that's the way the Bushes roll. They want to make sure that they don't leave anything on the field.  In any campaign that's down, you're looking for a life preserver.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And it was not to be. Mark McKinnon was chief media adviser to five successful presidential primary and general election campaigns, including former President George W. Bush's 2000 and 2004 campaigns.Mark, great to see you. Fascinating series. I know you say it's like being in the cockpit of a campaign. As somebody who's been through this so many times, tell us you what you find most interesting about documenting it, being the one, the historian on the trail?MARK MCKINNON, FORMER CHIEF MEDIA ADVISOR TO PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH: Well, there's -- I've always thought that there's so much fascinating human drama behind the scenes of a presidential campaign, the candidate, the candidate's families, the staffers, the people covering the race. There was just this amazing ecosystem of drama and pathos, and humor and pain, that's just dramatic, an entertaining and informative that most of the public never sees, and sometimes there have been documentaries six months or a year after an election, but I've always thought it would be incredible if viewers could see not only kind of what's happening, but as it's happening in real time. That's what we're doing with ""The Circus.""KELLY: How real is it? I mean, is it like Kardashian real or is it like, real, like you know, they know the cameras are there. So that's the question. You know, what are we seeing, real emotion or what are we seeing?MCKINNON: Well, what we've discovered is that after about 30 seconds, they forget that the cameras are there. And the thing that voters are really hungry for these days in politics is authenticity. They want to see what candidates are like when they're not doing the speeches, when they are not doing the talking points. They want to see how they interact, with family and staff.  KELLY: Well, let's go through a couple of them. Let's go -- so who are the ones that you have followed so far?MCKINNON: Well, we've followed everybody.KELLY: All right.MCKINNON: And we're following everybody on both sides of the race.  KELLY: All right. So, let's talk about Ted Cruz, for example, everybody says, he's almost the most hated man in Washington. His wife loves him. I know his former roommate in school who says he's a great guy. What have you seen?MCKINNON: Well, and I worked with him on the 2000 campaign. And what we've showed with Ted Cruz, we got on the buzz with him, and some great scenes of him that showed a sense of humor, a lightness, it showed him, it's like interacting with his staff and campaign people. That's why today was an interesting development. I talked to him about it today.  KELLY: In a kind way?MCKINNON: Not only just what happened but you know, when you -- yes, yes, I mean, it just showed a human way, when you have to, you know, let a friend and staff go, what is that like?KELLY: All right. How about Marco Rubio? Are you with him after that New Hampshire debate?MCKINNON: Yes.  KELLY: I mean, what was that like for him when he realized he had messed up in that debate and was not going to go out for him?  MCKINNON: Well, it was fascinating, it was really interesting, because nobody goes through politics in a presidential campaign, nobody wins, without going through a lot of adversity. So, we really were able to document, you know, what happened, when he got knocked down, could he dust himself off? Could he admit failure and be competitive enough to get back in the race which he is done? And the thing that really impressed me about Rubio more than anything was, he just has a really competitive vein, I mean, the guy is really competitive in a good way.KELLY: And a thirsty man, but we've been over that.(LAUGHTER)How about Donald Trump? What did you observe behind the scenes with him, his interactions with his families, his family and staffers?MCKINNON: Well, you know, I mean, he's just very -- he as real family man.  He's got a lot of family. His son was out here today in Elko. And he was terrific. I mean, he's just been --KELLY: Donald Jr. or Eric?MCKINNON: Donald Jr., he's at for the last two or three weeks. And he's good. I mean, he's got the chromosomes as well. And he gave a speech today and was terrific. But really great interaction with his family.  Shows what kind of a family man Donald Trump is. You know, a lot of family interaction and compelling stuff.  KELLY: It's great stuff. I'm jealous. I wish I could be everywhere like you are in experience it, but I will just watch ""The Circus"" and you will take me through it. Mark, great to see you.MCKINNON: Thanks for having me on.KELLY: All best.Well, as we mentioned, moments ago, after weeks of getting hammered for what rivals called dirty tricks, Senator Cruz today fired a top staffer.  We have got new details tonight on the inside story.Plus -- Governor John Kasich is here next to respond after top players in the GOP reportedly tell him, it's time to get out?And then Speaker of the House Paul Ryan joins us tonight as some media outlets are asking whether he could be the final Republican pick for president? We'll explain how that would work, just ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz has asked his communications director to resign. After what Cruz's critics called another lie. That is the critic's term. It is the latest in the list of accusations that Cruz is fielding from the Trump, Carson and now Rubio campaigns.Trace Gallagher has the details. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, at the very heart of the story, is a 21 seconds video published by the student newspaper of the University of Pennsylvania. It shows Marco Rubio walking past Ted Cruz's far and a Cruz campaign staffer who was reading the Bible. The audio is muffled. But here's five seconds of how the Daily Pennsylvanian subtitled what they thought Rubio said. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Got a good book there?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir.RUBIO: Not many answers in it. Especially in that one.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: The video went viral and the Cruz Spokesman's Rick Tyler put it on Twitter and Facebook. But Marco Rubio claims he didn't say, there were not many answers in the Bible, he said all the answers are in the Bible.  Rick Tyler agreed he got it wrong and deleted the post. Here he is apologizing on ""America's Newsroom"" prior to getting fired this morning.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICK TYLER, TED CRUZ CAMPAIGN FORMER SPOKESMAN: I would not knowingly post something I knew to be false. But you're right. The judgment about what he said was wrong, and so I apologize about that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Marco Rubio accepted the apology, but still attacked the Cruz campaign, saying, quote, ""At some point, there has to be some level of accountability,"" calling it, ""a very disturbing pattern of deceptive campaigns."" And it does come on the heels of the Cruz campaign being accused of spreading separate rumors that Marco Rubio and Ben Carson relieving the race. Still the firing came as a surprise, considering just last night the Cruz campaign thought that Marco Rubio was overreacting to Tyler's mistake. Today the tone shifted. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It turned out the news story he sent around was false, but I'll tell you, even if it was true, we are not a campaign that's going to question the faith of another candidate.  ""The Daily Pennsylvanian"" has now removed the subtitles -- Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you.Well, another campaign trail controversy this evening, this one involves Ohio Governor John Kasich, and fallout from remarks he made earlier today that when he first ran for office back in 1978, women actually left their kitchens to campaign for him. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How did I get elected? I didn't have nobody for me. We just got an army of people who -- and many women who left their kitchens to go out and go door to door and to put yard signs up for me all the way back when, you know, things were different.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: First of, I want to say your comment earlier about the women came out the kitchen to support you, I'll come to support you, but I won't be coming out of the kitchen.  KASICH: I got you, I got you.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Republican candidate for president and Governor of Ohio John Kasich. Governor, great to see you. I can certainly say that, if it were my husband, he would say, for the love of God, get out of the kitchen. No one wants you in here. You do bad things in here.KASICH: Look, here's the thing. You know, back when I started, we used to do these town halls, but they were held in homes, they were called coffees.  And we did some at the breakfast table, and some we did, you know, in the living room. And I have to tell you that there's no question a large part of my career was fueled by women who decided to join the effort and help me to get elected.KELLY: Uh-hm.KASICH: But, you know, let's be real about this. You know, my -- my campaign manager is a woman. She used to be my chief-of-staff. And if I'm president, who knows, she'll have one of the highest positions in the country. I have a lieutenant governor who's a woman. You know, the situation is I appointed a lady to the Ohio Supreme Court. You know, obviously a woman, and I have a number of very influential woman cabinet members. So, you know?KELLY: Back in 1978 when you first ran for office, 70 percent of women were not working out of the home full time. They just weren't. The vast majority of women were at home in that year full time, and things have changed a lot since then. I assume you know that.  KASICH: You know, Megyn, you know, I operate on the high wire. I'm not using that. I'm not scripted. I don't have a teleprompter. And every once in a while you say something and you know, maybe you didn't say it exactly the way you should. But, look, I'm not going to change that.  We've had a teleprompter and scripted candidates and presidents. It's time to move on and be real.  KELLY: Uh-hm. Listen, as somebody who has said many stupid things on the air, I can relate. I understand. I think you get a pass on a couple. You know, consistently then the people have to look at you but --(LAUGHTER)KASICH: I got you. Exactly.KELLY: I have heard that many. All right. So, let's talk about campaign 2016 because after South Carolina, the conventional wisdom is, oh, we'll look, the pressure is on Governor Kasich and Ben Carson to get out now.  Because the, quote, ""establishment"" has consolidated around Marco Rubio, and I look at the campaign headlines, or the headlines on the campaign trail today. National Review -- hard for us to see what legitimate purpose is served by either of them staying in. Red state -- for the sake of the country, get out of the race. You and Carson. Jeb Bush showed leadership by getting out, do the same thing and on it goes. To them you say what?KASICH: Well, it sounds like a bunch of Washington insiders, Megyn. Look, they didn't think I would get in the race, nobody thought that I would raise the money. Nobody thought I could do well in New Hampshire and I did. I never expected to do that great in South Carolina, as I told you.  But we do expect, look, I had 1,000 people tonight here in Richmond. I had over 1,000 people earlier at George Mason. We have people joining the campaign who are fundraisers, some of whom raised money for Jeb Bush. We have our political team expanding. And I'm not going to listen to a bunch of lobbyists insiders. I never have. I'm an independent person.And frankly for the first time in this campaign, my message is starting to be heard. And that's why we're getting crowds. So, everybody else, just sit back. I really don't have a lot of interest in what these people have to stay. I have people who come to me and say, we need you to stay in, you're hope for us. And that's where we're going to do. We'll see where it goes. Don't count me out, Megyn.  KELLY: I'm not counting anything. Let me ask you whether --KASICH: Yes.KELLY: -- Some people are speculating. And you one could even argue in some instances salivating over the prospect of a Rubio/Kasich ticket. Is that something you would even consider?  KASICH: Well, if you reversed it, if there was a Kasich/Rubio ticket, you know?  KELLY: Well, it's obvious. But what about the way I asked?KASICH: Look, no, Megyn, I don't run for second place. And let me explain. I'm beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than any other Republican in the race according to ""USA Today."" I'm now tied for third in the national polls. Look, I have always made the establishment nervous, because I don't take orders from them, from K Street or a bunch of lobbyists sitting up the top of some hotel. I've shaken the system up the entire time I've been in politics. And look, I've spent very little money, this family folks have spent $50 million. I spent like five, you know, and we're doing just fine.  KELLY: Last question, you have an ad out today that sort of parlays off of that extraordinary moment you had with that young man on the campaign trail in South Carolina. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Being president is more than the economy or health care.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was really in a dark place for a long time, but I've found hope and now I've found it in my presidential candidate that I support, and I would really appreciate one of those hugs you've been talking about.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is a place for quiet strength. The Oval Office.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: New Day for America is responsible for the content of this advertising.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was the PAC, not you, but that was narrated by Tim Allen. The comedian. He was on THE KELLY last week saying how much he liked you. How much do you think -- how much of an impact do you think that hug had on your campaign?KASICH: Well, my immediate reaction in hearing about that ad is I don't like it.  KELLY: Why not?KASICH: Look, because I just don't like that. I think it spoke for itself. And, look, I'm not going to yell at my people who, you know, I'm not even connected to take something off the air. But I'm not comfortable with that. Look, a woman tonight talked about five suicides in her family.  Earlier today, a lady came and talked to me and hugged me and told me about an autistic child, an adult child, and a 16-year-old that has a mental illness. If I can be able to touch people, and have them safe to come and talk about things they care about, that's great. But I just -- I'm just -- something strikes me wrong about it. I haven't thought about it, Megyn, but I mean, what can I say?All I can tell you is this -- this country is going to work best when we have leaders in Washington and when where we live in our own communities that we put things together in strength, and things and not wait for somebody to come in and try to straighten out our schools or our neighborhoods. We need to do it ourselves. So, anyway, it was a precious moment, but they've been happening for six months. And that sort of longing is why you stay in this race. And I'm excited about the future here.KELLY: Great to see you, Governor.KASICH: Thanks, Megyn. God bless.  KELLY: Well, we are hearing again and again this year how voters are angry, and mostly with Congress. So up next, we will put the question to Speaker Paul Ryan, who is here live. Why is he making everyone so upset?  He's here to respond.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: A growing question tonight about the direction of the republican parties and how Donald Trump managed to secure his second primary victory over the weekend in South Carolina. Some folks blame President Obama and a general sense of frustration among some voters who maybe casting their ballots for the very first time.Others think our next guest can claim credit for fueling Trump's rise and he just so happens to be Speaker of the House. Congressman Paul Ryan is a republican out of Wisconsin and current speaker of the House of Representative. Great to see you.REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Good to be back with you.KELLY: So, there's a piece in ""The American Thinker"" where the writer suggests that you have fueled Donald Trump's rise because you are tone-deaf to the concerns of republicans, for example the Budget Bill that went through, had no money for a border fence. It funded Obama's ""Executive Amnesty Program."" It allowed funding for the Refugee Program. It allowed funding for sanctuary cities, so they say you don't get it.RYAN: Yeah, well, first of all, this is what divided government is. The problem with divided government is you can't get everything you want, number one. Number two, I inherited this mess from the earlier congress. Everybody kind of knows that this Budget Bill was done basically before I became speaker four months ago, but we also got some very good conservative wins.We had very good Pro-Life writers. We got very good writers on the Internal Revenue Service. We got a lot of good conservative wins.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: People hear that and they say, he's talking about compromise. We hate compromise. That's why also a lot of people love Ted Cruz.RYAN: I know.KELLY: They say, you know, die trying, die trying.RYAN: You know what, I find myself giving civics lessons all the time these days. The problem we have is ...KELLY: Am I going to get one now?RYAN: Maybe a short lesson, maybe two sentences. For a bill to become a law, it has to pass the house, then the senate and then the President sign it into law.KELLY: Schoolhouse rocks.RYAN: And you have a liberal progressive presidents who won't sign conservative bills into law, they don't go into law. We put abolishing ObamaCare and defending Planned Parenthood on the president's desk, he vetoed that. We don't have the votes to override that veto. He's vetoed six bills we've sent to him in the last few months. We don't have a veto -- we don't have the votes to override those vetoes.KELLY: On that point, realistically, if this electorate puts a republican in the white house and flips the senate back to the Dems, which a lot of people believe will happen, but the republicans hold the house. Is anything going to change?RYAN: I don't think that's going to happen. If we win the White House, I think we keep the senate.KELLY: You think so?RYAN: Yes I do, but here's the point. What we are doing in the house is we believe we need to respect the country and respect the moment for what it is. Everything is up for grabs in 2016. Now, the Supreme Court is up for grabs. Congress is up for grabs and the presidency is up for grabs. And so the question before us in 2016 is are we going to re-claim a constitutional republic or we're going to go down this path of having this liberal progressive welfare state that President Obama has been building. Now, here is what we are going to do the in house.We are going to give an agenda to the country, we're going to roll it out this spring and we're going to have five big areas that we think are the big areas that will make or break this country going forward. We're going to lay it out and we're going to give the people a clear and compelling choice. The way we see our job in congress -- you think people are frustrated? Try being in congress with this presidency. Think of the frustration we have.KELLY: It must be terrible. No, but it must be terrible. When we talk about the approval ratings of congressmen to being lower than a cockroach, that's just mean and I'm sorry to say this.RYAN: Slightly above the bubonic plague.KELLY: But that must be very disheartening. I know some members of congress and they say it's disheartening to them because they're trying but the system is dysfunctional.RYAN: It's disheartening. But we need the people to break this tie. So what we're going to do this year is take an agenda on economic growth, on getting people out of the poverty, on replacing ObamaCare and reforming entitlements to prevent them from going bankruptcy and paying off our debts.KELLY: What do you mean taking an agenda? I mean, what do you mean?RYAN: We're going to offer specific plans. We're going to say, here is what we can do with a republican president in 2017 --KELLY: To try to get the voters --RYAN: If you elect us, this is what we'll do because the key, Gretchen -- I mean Megyn ...KELLY: Close.RYAN: Megyn, sorry, I was just talking to Gretchen over there -- the key, Megyn, is we have to have the people breaking this tie. We have this divided government -- liberal president conservative congress. It's not working.KELLY: So you don't think anything can get done unless this one party rules.RYAN: Look at the path we are on. Seventy percent of Americans believe that we're on the wrong path. We have to do big things soon to get our country back on the right track. And so what we're going to do is offer the country --KELLY: To try to persuade them your ideas are better.RYAN: To try to persuade them.KELLY: And I know you are an idea and you're a policy guy.RYAN: Give us a republican president. Give us a president we can work with.KELLY: But we are ...RYAN: In 2017 we can get this country back in the right track.KELLY: You're a policy guys, this seems to be more of a personality driven election. I mean, that people are gravitating --RYAN: That's right.KELLY: -- to a different kind of message. Your thoughts on that?RYAN: Well, I think when idea contests, as republicans, I think we typically lose personality contests. And so again, that's why we're adding ideas to this. We're going to bring a layer of substance and a foundation of principles and ideas to this campaign so we can have more of an ideas contest. This is what I wish we had in 2012. You can't wait until the convention, you can't wait to the fall to then roll out your agenda.KELLY: What about that?RYAN: WE have to do it earlier.KELLY: Do you think there's a chance of a brokered convention?RYAN: I doubt that.KELLY: Because you would have to preside over it as Speaker of the House.RYAN: One of things -- I have six days notice to taking this job. I learned about that after I took the job.KELLY: This is not disclosed, not disclosed. But wait, some of theories and I actually found quite a few people pitching this, is that Paul Ryan will be the republican nominee and (inaudible) will call Stephen Hawkins and others suggest the way it could happen is they take the first vote and the pledged delegates vote as they've said they will, and it doesn't go through, nobody has enough.And that on the second vote, they're allowed to sort of go where they want, and people say we can't agree in any of these guys. Look at him, he's so handsome ...RYAN: Oh, thank you.KELLY: ... he's such a nice man. He's trying so hard. Mitt Romney loved him. Why don't we make him our nominee?RYAN: No way, ain't going to happen. First of all, I think you should run for president if you're going to be president. I chose consciously a year ago, my family and I decided not to run for president. I'm not running for president. I'm not going to be the president. It's going to be somebody who is running for president. The point in the house that we're trying to make is we believe me we are frustrated.We see the country slipping. We see the future going away from us and so we want to put it all on the table and give the country a really clear and compelling choice, so we can win a mandate. What we're trying to do is get a 1980 type of election, but for today's circumstances and issues, to get a mandate so we can fix this mess in 2017.KELLY: Maybe the clean shave will help. We did a split screen. Check it out. See what you think. I don't know.RYAN: So, I'm a bow hunter, and I grow a beard every deer season and no one made a point about this last year when I had a beard.KELY: Did the deers find the beard more scary?RYAN: I'm from Wisconsin, it's cold. If you're sitting on a tree half a day ...KELLY: Oh, it's for work. You know they have like scars.RYAN:m I've heard of those.(LAUGHING)KELLY: Great to see you.RYAN: You too Megyn.KELLY: Thanks for being here. Well, breaking tonight after a series of democratic primaries are decided by coin flips and cutting cards, folks are now asking if all of this will stand? We'll talk about that with Judge Napolitano. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When a candidate says they want to carpet bomb Isis into oblivion, would that be possible?MICHAEL HAYDEN, RETIRED FOUR STAR GENERAL: No, and it would be immoral and would be unworthy of the republic like ourselves, and Secretary Gates is absolutely right. Remember I began by saying these are hard issues. It's infinitely gray and now in the debates very often we turn them into bumper stickers.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have had Donald Trump saying he'd water board.HAYDEN: Yeah, actually Trump says he'd water board and a lot worse, because they deserve it and we've never did anything to anyone because they deserved it. This was never looking backward. This was trying to keep America safe looking forward. People can argue about what we did, but it was never, never a form of punishment.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was General Michael Hayden, the only man who has ever served as director of both the NSA and the CIA, taking on some of the recent foreign policy arguments from Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz. Joining me now, General Michael Hayden, who's out with a new book called "" Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the age of terror."" General, great to see you.HAYDEN: Great to see you to, Megyn.KELLY: Unbelievable story and it's more than an opportunity for the American people to hear it directly from you. So you don't believe in carpet bombing. As for you torture and water boarding, which Trump says we should bring back. What say you as the guy who was at the CIA when we were doing that?HAYDEN: Well, I mean, on a very practical candid basis, Megyn, I don't know that we could convince any CIA officer to do it. I think as I've said a few weeks ago that if a new president or future president wants to water board somebody, he better bring his own bucket because after CIA did this in good faith, under the opinion of the attorney general, that it was lawful, the American political system turned against it.And that commitment to CIA officers, when they go out and do something edgy for the republic, authorized by the president, approved by the attorney general, briefed by congress and the director says, I think this is a good thing to do, they think they've got a social contract with the American republic, and it has a half-life longer than the next (off year) election and CIA officers have been taughtt that's no longer true.KELLY: They were thrown under the bus.HAYDEN: They will not go do this. Many people will celebrate that, but there are a whole bunch of other things that CIA officers are going to be asked to do that are on the edge that I fear they will be reluctant to do.KELLY: And you think they should that's why the book is called ""Playing to the Edge.""HAYDEN: It is.KELLY: Because you think they should press the limits, because they are really the ones who are in large part -- charged with protecting us.HAYDEN: Well, they work in a unique space. You go into the CIA headquarters, you look down the hall and you see this mural -- Lady Liberty -- We are the nation's first line of defense, we accomplish what others cannot accomplish. We go where others cannot go.We have a special space for the protection of the republic. We are expected to do, we are asked to do things that no one else has asked or allowed to do to keep America safe.KELLY: What about another proposal we've heard. This one is also from Trump, that we should be killing the terrorists' families because that will make them pay attention?HAYDEN: You know, I say play to the edge, but there are lines. There are lines beyond which our nation should not go, all right. That's unethical, that's immoral that violates all the laws of armed conflict, and frankly, it's not even a winning hand if you jump over the moral restraints. All you've done there is to animate your enemy by your barbaric action.KELLY: What about some of the candidates in this race. Ted Cruz and others -- Ron Paul, no longer in -- but proposed getting rid of this NSA surveillance program that you favored and implemented, and replacing it with something that Cruz argues now is actually more robust, that gives them more access to more phone records. Is that true in your view?HAYDEN: It's a mixed bag and it's a complicated picture, all right. Now, the system we now have based upon the USA Freedom Act is NSA no longer gets to keep the data.KELLY: Right, the phone companies keep it.HAYDEN: Right, but it actually gets access to a bit more data than it had before.KELY: So you like it replaced?HAYDEN: No, no, that's a plus, all right. Let me give you my candid assessment. This is Kentucky (inaudible), so it's a broad assessment. I suspect what we've got here is kind of the 85 percent solution. If this were the best way to set this up, that's the way I would have set it up in October of 2001.And frankly, what I do in the book is to take these and other issues like them, Megyn, and explain that we're not operating in black and white here, we're operating in continuous gray and these are always difficult decision.KELLY: What about the Hillary matter and the disclosure of classified information, top secret information and many of these e-mails, including we're told some, you know, spy information.HAYDEN: First of all, the most important caveat, -- I haven't seen any of these, so I really don't know what is or is not in them, but I would give you my view -- the sin here is absolutely the original sin. Once you set it up this way, this can't go to a happy place.KELLY: The private server?HAYDEN: The private server. I mean what's going to happen is people, they don't have to be ignorant or stupid or immoral or unethical, just in the press of business. They're going to put things into that system that are now going to end up in this unprotected server, and as the former director of NSA, if I could have gotten access to the server of the foreign minister of a potential adversary of the United States, even for their unclassified e-mails, I'd have moved heaven and earth to do that.KELLY: Was it reckless?HAYDEN: It was really imprudent and I really don't know why the permanent government, the folks -- the state would actually not have gone to the secretary and said, ""Ma'am, you just can't do it this way.""KELLY: General Michael Hayden, looking forward reading the entire thing -- again, I want to get it ""Playing to the Edge. American Intelligence in the Age of Terror."" it is out tomorrow. Check it out. Great to see you sir.HAYDEN: Thank you.KELLY: Thank you for your service.HATDEN: Thank you.KELLY: Ahead, democrats using games of chance to determine election outcomes, but are they gambling with a possible lawsuit? Judge Napolitano will rule, when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: And developing tonight, new reaction to democratic delegates being awarded by games of chance -- the latest, to the benefit of democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. On Saturday, Mrs. Clinton won the Nevada caucuses with one precinct requiring a tiebreaker to pick the winner. This is not the first time we've seen this. This one however, was done by drawing cards. She pulled the ace of clubs and beat Senator Sanders.Judge Andrew Napolitano is Fox News' senior judicial analyst. This is done pursuant to Democratic Party rules. We saw the same thing in Iowa where several of the precincts were decided by coin toss. Originally we were told she won all seven out of seven but now today we found that it's actually, she only won half. At the time, I said it could not be possible. There's no way she won half because they said she tails every time and tails never wins.ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Right. But it did seem as though she won seven out of seven. Now, she's won four out of seven.KELLY: Well, could he challenge? This is like mumbo jumbo.NAPOLITANO: I don't think he can challenge it. When you submit your petition and your name was on the ballot, you sign a bunch of agreements, one of which is if there's a tie here's how we're going to break it. And the rest of the world they draw names out of a hat or they flip a coin. In Las Vegas, they pull a card out of a deck of cards and you agree. There's no appeal from that unless there was some corruption in the act of pulling the card.KELLY: I think there should be some skill involved. I think they should make them row sham bow. That would be much more fair. At least you've got a fighting chance.NAPOLITANO: Right.KELLY: All right, I want to ask you first of all what General Michael Hayden just said about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.NAPOLITANO: General Hayden and I have disagreed in a lot of things but nobody knows more about the way the NSA works and about the way the internet works and about the way you secure information on the internet than General Hayden. He just indicted her, lower case ""i"" by arguing the unbelievable significance to the enemy, even to our allies to want to get a leg up on us of having the Secretary of State of the United States use a non-secured server for four years and the president being aware of it and doing nothing about it.KELLY: He raises a good point about where were the career state department employees to say, ""Madam Secretary, you can't do this. With all due respect to your convenience, you can't.""NAPLOITANO: Where was the White House?KELLY: On a subject of Hillary Clinton, she gave an extraordinary interview to CBS' Scott Pelley last week. Here's part of it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SCOTT PELLEY, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: Jimmy Carter famously said I will not lie to you.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Uh-huh. Well, I have to tell you, I have tried in every way I know how, literally from my years as a young lawyer all the way through my time as Secretary of State to level with the American people.PELLEY: When you talk about leveling with the American people, have you always told the truth?CLINTON: I've always tried to. Always, always.PELLEY: Some people are going to call that wriggle room that you just gave yourself -- always tried to.CLINTON: Well no, no ...PELLEY: Jimmy Carter said I will never lie to you.CLINTON: You know you're asking me to say have I ever -- I don't believe I ever have. I don't believe I ever have. I don't believe I ever will. I'm going to do the best I can to level with the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Still feel uncomfortable.NAPOLITANO: She not only lies, she lies about lying and Scott Pelley had to coax her into the truth.KELLY: Wouldn't it have been a lie for any presidential candidate to say, I've never lied? I don't believe -- all of them lie!NAPLOITANO: But for her to say I try to tell the truth, what the heck kind of an answer is that?KELLY: It was more like, I try. I try. Remember we said that voice goes up, it's a tell, judge.NAPOLITANO: It's the worst number she gets in all the polls. Dishonesty.KELLY: It's a tough question. Great to see you.NAPOLITANO: Pleasure.KELLY: We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: On Wednesday evening, please join us for a candidate forum. Senator Cruz, Senato Rubio, Governor Kasich and Dr. Carson all join yours truly and the voters of Texas for a Q & A just days before the big Super Tuesday vote. Hope you'll tune in.

"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" January 23, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX HOST: Did the IRS just get caught again targeting conservatives? First, the Tea Party, and now the IRS accused of trying to smoke out conservatives from Hollywood. That's right. If you aren't a typical Hollywood liberal, then you better watch out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CHANTING) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely, we were targeted, and it feels kind of creepy to be on somebody's enemy list, especially when it's the government.PAT BUCHANAN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR: They have a rogue agency that they knew nothing about that has 100,000 employees.BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency, but especially in the IRS.REP. JOHN BOEHNER, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: My question is, who is going to jail over this scandal?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And to find out that, they are not going to press any charges, and they are saying nothing is wrong is outrageous.(END VIDEO CLIP) VAN SUSTEREN: And, in just minutes, a high-profile Hollywood insider, who says the IRS has targeted him, is here to go ON THE RECORD.First, our political panel, ""The Weekly Standard's"" Steve Hayes; ""The Cook Political Report's"" Amy Water; and ""The Hill's"" A.B. Stoddard.Steve, first of all, what is going on with this?STEVE HAYES, 'THE WEEKLY STANDARD': It certainly sounds like the IRS is targeting this group Friends of Abe, which exists in Hollywood. It's part of a broader pattern we have seen of the IRS targeting conservative groups across the country.This group is particularly interesting. It's existed mainly in street now for the better part of a decade. They don't do much. They don't have much in the way of political activities. They get together, they have a big annual dinner every year. They sometimes go out and meet at a bar and have drinks and play pool. But it's not a group that's out there actively working in politics on a day-to-week or week-to-week or month-to-month basis.So it is curious to me that the IRS would target them and visit upon them such scrutiny, given their rather limited and pretty much harmless political activities.VAN SUSTEREN: As I understand it, they have been given, Amy, a bunch of extra questions to answer.AMY WALTER, 'THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT': Right.VAN SUSTEREN: They have tried to become tax exempt for the last two years, still pending. And they feel intimidated.WALTER: Well, you know, the reality now is, if you have any link at all to politics, anyone who is associated with your group, who has made any sort of political statements, who is out front in any way, shape, or form, and you go and you apply for tax exempt status, you are going to get a level of scrutiny.VAN SUSTEREN: Both sides? Because I think --(CROSSTALK) WALTER: Right, the issue in this case clearly is that these were high-profile people who also happen to be Republicans. Now, what's going to be curious to see is, are we going to see more cases of this of outside groups getting scrutiny, or what we're going to see, I think, fewer people saying or fewer people going and asking the IRS for tax exempt status. Saying, you know what, let's just be a (c)4 instead of 501(c)3, so we don't have to go through these hoops.A.B. STODDARD, 'THE HILL': I actually agree. I think that just because like-minded people want to hang out together and have good speakers come, they shouldn't be exempt from taxation. I think, given the fact that we are in the state of tremendous debt, I think the entire tax exemption system that we have and all of the specifics of it should be heavily scrutinized.(CROSSTALK) STODDARD: That said, one group should not be more scrutinized than the other if they are under the same designation and the code. Right now, there are rules that the ""Wall Street Journal"" reported on late last week that were written on in November, new rules designed to curtail even further any kind of political activity that these 501(c)3 groups can do. And that they -- and it was -- it was kept very quiet. But the administration has made sure through these new rules that they are going to get to do less than they even did before.Is it political to invite Herman Cain to your dinner like Friends of Abe did? No it's not. If they don't have a political agenda, then they shouldn't be subjected to that kind of scrutiny. But some groups, I still think, should.VAN SUSTEREN: But here's the problem. I don't know if they have to renew every year or get the whole set of questions. The Tea Party is relatively new. And anyone who is applying now, if you are going to put that harsh scrutiny on them, the people are already sort of grandfathered in, they are in good shape. It's the new group they will be pushing in.WALTER: Is this something that happened two years ago and it was part of what we learned about with the Tea Party groups and they were part of this? And it's still today part of the issue or is it something that's happened since we learned about the scrutiny.(CROSSTALK) WALTER: You know what I mean? Is this something that is new or was it already happening at the same time?HAYES: Or in some combination. What we saw with the Tea Party was really unprecedented. The kind of scrutiny that the Tea Party had to withstand, and the fact that the Tea Party disappeared for large stretches of the pre-2012 election cycle. I mean, you remember, there were members of the media were saying where is the Tea Party? Part of that was, of course, you know, the energy of that kind of a movement dies down or subsides a little bit. Part of it was answered by the fact that they didn't get their status that they had been seeking. When you have the Tea Party leaders appear before Congress and they were asked this question, they said basically we were rendered dormant for that time period.(CROSSTALK) WALTER: Let's be clear, there is not less money in politics now because of what's been happening with the IRS?VAN SUSTEREN: Here is sort of the secret way you can really be awful with the IRS for something like the Tea Party or conservatives or any group, liberals or whatever, is you don't make a decision. You simply keep sending questions because, without a decision, you can't appeal to the next level. And things don't have to take two years to go through to figure out whether or not something is tax exempt now. That's the one thing I have never seen anyone really sort of hone in and look at. Was there unduly -- was there a length of time imposed on certain groups that other groups got a swifter road?HAYES: Yeah, I think there was no question that was the case, particularly with the wave of scrutiny that the Tea Party groups had to with stand. But there is another problem. Unions are not subject to the same rules. Unions are a 501(c)5. They play by entirely different set of rules. When you, in effect, redefine politics to broaden the scope and you use it to look, particularly at conservative groups, but a wide variety of these tax exempt groups, but you don't subject unions to the same scrutiny, to the same rules, that's a built-in problem. It's baked in.(CROSSTALK) VAN SUSTEREN: A.B., that goes back to where -- you have got to do everybody, if you are going to make everyone.STODDARD: Right. Not only is Steve right that the unions are in a different designation under the code, but obviously everyone that is under the same one needs to be held to the same argument of scrutiny. My argument is just that, in the state we are in, with our budget situation, we are not to be just exempting people willy nilly because they like to get together once in a while.(CROSSTALK) VAN SUSTEREN: But to make a level playing field, let's revoke everybody else who has already got it. You know, we have got it do that too.STODDARD: I think the American people really have a very small understanding of how many groups are actually getting exempt from taxation. I think they wouldn't like it if they knew it.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. Panel, stay with us. We have much more to talk to you about.But right now, the Friends of Abe protects its members identities, fearing the members will be blacklisted in liberal Hollywood. But a few members of the curve group have gone public, including movie writer and producer, Lionel Chetwynd. He joins us. Nice to see you, sir.LIONEL CHETWYND, MOVIE WRITER & PRODUCER: Good to see you, Greta. Pleased to be here.VAN SUSTEREN: So, Friends of Abe, I know you are not going to tell me who are the members. Let me ask you, first, are they really fearful they will be blacklisted if they are named as members of the sort of loosely conservative group, this loosely gathered group?CHETWYND: Many are. I mean, a lot of it depends on what stage of your career that you are at. Hollywood, there's a blacklist as a white list. And a career in Hollywood, to build it, requires getting yourself positioned so that you are perceived as someone who can be useful, who is employable, who participates, who belongs. One of the easy ways to do that is to be politically active, particularly on the left. In fact, only on the left.Beginning in the sixties, I suppose, but with increasing vigor, you know, politics became -- personal politics became very much a part of the fabric of Hollywood, a part of our life and the part of the way we meet. If you are not there, if you are not one of them, then you are not one of them.(CROSSTALK) CHETWYND: And yeah, that's going to hurt you in terms of awareness and you have to climb up. That's not easy, no.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. Is Friends of Abe's being unfairly targeted by the IRS? And how do you know that?CHETWYND: Well, I don't think we want to start a war game with the IRS. But we send them care packages. No. Look, we applied for tax exempt status out of a community in which these things are, again, part of the tapestry. People from the American way, Norman Lehrer -- there's about four of these organizations. They sprout up all over the place, constantly raising money. They are constantly active. We wanted to try and find some more formal way to channel what we do and be more intelligent about it. Steve's description obviously is sort of a Rotary Club on valium, massive valium. Isn't really that far off. But we are a little more than that. We wanted to plant our feet in the ground, collect money from people interested in what we were doing, and trying to organize a program and educate ourselves about who we are and how we relate to the outside world.That application was made a very, very long time ago. And it had been met only with questions and more questions and more questions without resolution, which means that you really can't go any further. And so, what -- one would have to feel, well, we are not a very high priority. Whereas, we see other organizations in town with a different point of view, get through the process much more quickly.VAN SUSTEREN: Is -- I mean, I guess the conclusion is you feel that your -- because of your political leanings that your group, because it's more conservative, is discriminated against in favor of perhaps a more left leaning group in Hollywood. Is that a fair statement?CHETWYND: Well, the question -- we know that there was a lookout list, right? We know that, be on the lookout for. And people who ended up on that list were treated to much more dilatory process than those who weren't. We have been at this over two years. And it -- you know, nobody wants to sit on FOX News and denounce the IRS. At least I don't, in any event. In this particular, we are very vulnerable because almost everyone here is an independent contractor and, therefore, we all sort of -- everyone is a walking S corporation. But I think it's fair to say that we have been subjected to a scrutiny that goes beyond what might be reasonably expected, yeah, by far.VAN SUSTEREN: Lionel, thanks for joining us.CHETWYND: My pleasure."

This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" October 13, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, exclusive interviews with four women who claim that their lives have been ruined by the Clintons. Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey have all accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. Now, you're going to their stories in just a few minutes.But, first, at the age of 12, Kathy Shelton was allegedly raped by a 41- year-old man, and Hillary Clinton defended that man accused of sexually assaulting her. Here's her story.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATHY SHELTON, CHILD RAPE VICTIM: I was 12 years old. Hillary put me through something that you'd never put a 12-year-old through.HANNITY (voice-over): In 1975, Hillary Clinton, then a public defense attorney, she defended a 41-year-old man who was accused of raping a 12- year-old girl.SHELTON: It would be very hard for me not to walk up and smack her. I know that sounds mean. I mean, she put me through a lot at 12 years old.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Her client, she represented, got him off and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He took a lie detector test.  I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.SHELTON: She hasn't even thought about even coming to me and saying, I'm sorry. You know, that would be nice after what she said on tape.What happens if that daughter of yours, if that would have her, I mean, you would have protected her. Where you don't know me so I'm a piece of trash to you.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And earlier today, I spoke to Kathy Shelton and her attorney, Candice Jackson. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Let's go back. You're 12 years old. You went through a vicious violent rape. You were in a coma as a result for five days, stitched up.  As a result, you can't have children?SHELTON: Ninety-nine percent chance that I can't.HANNITY: Yes.SHELTON: Which is pretty much saying no.HANNITY: And you learned that at the time?SHELTON: Yes, the doctor come in and told me that before I was released.HANNITY: Walk us through what happened in your case when you were 12 years old.SHELTON: My mom was sending me to church with some friends. It was a couple blocks away. And I wanted to ride my bicycle because it was still light. And after it was over, she was going to pick me and the bicycle up.  But before I made it there, I was yanked off the bicycle by two guys, which one was underage so they're not able to bring him up.I was taken on a road. I was trying to get out. First, I told them I wasn't going with them, and I was going to try to leave and they wouldn't let me. They yanked me off the bicycle, and I was taken down on a road somewhere. And by that time, pretty much my clothes was ripped off of me and I was screaming and crying and I couldn't get nobody's attention.It was like, this road, all I could see was fields and they raped me there.  And they beat me so bad that I think they thought I was dead when they left. But I remember him saying, you like it, don't you (bleep). You like it. You want more of it.HANNITY: You're 12 years old. You were in a coma for five days after.SHELTON: Yes, sir. I crawled to a porch that I still don't know where it is to this day. And they were coming back to finish me off, and this lady turned her porch light on. I was told it was a lady, is how I know that.  I have no idea who it is --HANNITY: You don't remember? And then?SHELTON: -- today. And that's what saved me. She got their tag number.  And I fell out at that time and I woke up five days later.HANNITY: And it was so brutally violent, you needed stitches. You were brutally raped.SHELTON: Yes, sir.HANNITY: Yes. Hillary Clinton said she did a favor for a friend to be the attorney for the accused in this case. And as we just played, ""I had him take a polygraph test which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,"" and then she laughed. She was bragging about getting this guy off. Now, he faced 30 years to life. He ended up getting off with time served.So my question to you is, when you hear those words and her bragging about that case, a fascinating case as she calls it, what is she communicating there?SHELTON: That she's going to win her first case whatever it takes, if she has to lie, cheat or steal.HANNITY: Doesn't it also imply that she thinks he's guilty?SHELTON: Yes, sir, definitely.HANNITY: ""Which forever destroyed by faith in polygraphs.""SHELTON: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, she thinks he's guilty or she wouldn't have said that.HANNITY: As part of the court filings in this case, you --SHELTON: I don't think she thinks, she knows.HANNITY: She knew.SHELTON: Yes, she knew he was guilty.HANNITY: As part of the court filings, she filed an affidavit, and she wrote that she had been informed -- this is talking about you -- the victim was a girl that was emotionally unstable, had a tendency to seek out older men and engage in, quote, fantasizing. ""I had also been told by an expert in child psychology that children in early adolescence tend to exaggerate or romanticize sexual experiences and adolescents in disorganized families, such as complainants, are even more prone to exaggerate behavior"".SHELTON: My mom was a very strict mother on me. As a matter of fact, when I was 18, it was almost impossible to do anything then. But at that time, after what happened to me, I didn't want to do anything.HANNITY: Understandable.CANDICE JACKSON, KATHY SHELTON'S ATTORNEY: All of those things, Sean, that Hillary Clinton put in that affidavit were intended to force Kathy to undergo further psychiatric evaluations and interrogations. They were all things that were intended to portray her as a liar, someone who made up this rape. That if there was a rape, that if there was sex, it was consensual at her age as a virgin of 12 years old. And all of those tactics are things that you would never expect some sort of women's rights advocate to engage in because --HANNITY: Isn't that blaming the victim?JACKSON: That is blaming the victim. And --HANNITY: Don't we have rape shield laws that prohibit this thing?JACKSON: Almost every state now would prohibit those tactics, and you would expect someone like Hillary Clinton, some sort of a self-proclaimed feminist who cares about women and children, to not need a rape shield law in order to zealously defend a client without engaging in the tactics of blaming the victim.HANNITY: And, Kathy, obviously, this has impacted you your whole life.  What do you want the American people to hear out of this?SHELTON: That --HANNITY: It's pretty obvious she knew this guy was guilty. She --SHELTON: Just about every speech that I've seen Hillary do, she says I'm for women and children. And if she was for children, then she would not have put me through what I went through.HANNITY: Last question. This election is in 26 days. She's running as, isn't it time for a woman to be President of the United States?SHELTON: Not like that. The world won't last with her in it because she's going to lie, cheat and steal to get what she wants.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And also tonight, over the course of several decades, Bill Clinton has faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct, and Hillary Clinton has been accused of attacking the women who have made these accusations about her husband.In 1978, Juanita Broaddrick claimed that she was raped in a hotel room by the future president. In 1993, while serving as a volunteer at the White House, Kathleen Willey accused Bill Clinton of groping and fondling and grabbing and touching and kissing her against her will. And in 1994, Paula Jones sued Bill Clinton for allegedly exposing himself to her resulting in an $850,000 settlement. Here are their stories.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SAM DONALDSON, ABC NEWS HOST: Sexual harassment is shocking enough without having the President of the United States accused of it.PAULA JONES, BILL CLINTON ACCUSER: What Mr. Clinton did to me was wrong.KATHLEEN WILLEY, BILL CLINTON ACCUSER: Then he kissed me on my mouth and pulled me closer to him.HANNITY: You begged him to stop?JUANITA BROADDRICK, BILL CLINTON ACCUSER: Yes.WILLEY: And then he took my hand and he put it on him.BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT: I have said that nothing improper happened.BROADDRICK: Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me.B. CLINTON: I am mystified and disappointed by this turn of events.JONES: I have been telling the truth.WILLEY: Before I testified in the Paula Jones case, a stranger approached me, mentioned my 13-year-old cat who had disappeared, my tires which had been vandalized, and asked how my children by name were and said, you're just not getting the message.This is about what Hillary Clinton is doing to women like me so that she can attain the presidency. She wants us all to be quiet.H. CLINTON: The great story here is this vast right wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.BROADDRICK: And she came over to me, took ahold of my hand and said, I've heard so much about you. She was just holding on to my hand. She didn't -- because I had started to turn away from her and she held on to my hand and she said, do you understand everything that you do? I mean, cold chills went up my spine.JONES: In the end I know, I will get my good name and reputation back.BROADDRICK: That's the first time I became afraid of that woman.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And earlier, I spoke with Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Willey. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Thank you all for being here.BROADDRICK: Oh, thanks.JONES: You're welcome.WILLEY: My pleasure.JONES: I'm glad to be here.HANNITY: You were invited to the second debate, correct?BROADDRICK: Yes.JONES: Mm-hmm.HANNITY: Yes. And you all came willingly. You wanted to go. Why?WILLEY: I wanted to support Donald Trump, first and foremost. But I think that the thing that we wanted to get over -- the thing that's most important to me and to us is to tell the women, especially the younger women in this country and the older women and everybody, that everybody in the mainstream press is calling all of Bill Clinton's crimes infidelities.Rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment are not infidelities. They are crimes and they are misdemeanors. His wife is covering for him. No champion of women attacks the victims of sexual assaults and rapes.HANNITY: Paula?JONES: The same thing. I just want to remind, you know, the young people that doesn't know our stories and maybe have seen it for the first time, and I wanted them to see that we were there and why we were there and that, hopefully, that would have made a statement.HANNITY: Juanita?BROADDRICK: Yes. I think it's real important for the millennials to know, those that weren't born when I came forward after Bill Clinton raped me and those that were too young to understand what we went through, especially the time that it was, back in the '70s. It was very hard for someone to come forward.And so, yes, I did go to the Trump debate. I thought that we might possibly be able to bring this out and influence people and be able to tell them that Hillary is not for all women. Hillary is only for one woman and that's herself.HANNITY: I think you raise a really good point because I think there is this whole generation of people that do not know your stories.BROADDRICK: Right.HANNITY: Over the years, I have had the opportunity to get to know all of you and interview all of you. And really, I think the more important thing today is, considering this is even in the news today with Donald Trump, has the mainstream media been receptive to asking you three about your stories?BROADDRICK: Oh, definitely not.JONES: No.WILLEY: No.HANNITY: Nobody?BROADDRICK: No.JONES: Nobody's asked.WILLEY: No.HANNITY: Nobody has asked?JONES: No. No.HANNITY: The New York Times never called you?JONES: No. No, never.BROADDRICK: Not until we went into the Trump spin room. And that was --HANNITY: OK. While they were there?BROADDRICK: Yes.HANNITY: But in other words -- this is really an important point, because they're all reporting today Donald Trump did this or kissed this person or that person. You're saying that none of these media outlets contacted you in this election campaign?JONES: No. They don't care.BROADDRICK: No, nothing like CNN --HANNITY: To tell your story?JONES: Uh-uh.BROADDRICK: -- or NBC or ABC --HANNITY: ABC?BROADDRICK: -- or CBS.HANNITY: CBS. Well, with 26 days to go and they haven't contacted you, does that reek of politics to you?JONES: Absolutely.WILLEY: Oh, yes.BROADDRICK: Oh, my goodness, yes.JONES: That should tell you something.BROADDRICK: Yes.HANNITY: Yes. Well, let me give you the opportunity, for those people that have never heard your story. Juanita, we'll start with you.BROADDRICK: Back in 1978, when I was working for Bill Clinton's campaign for governor, I was raped by Bill Clinton. I was viciously raped. And then three weeks later, when I happened to be at a fundraiser for him -- but I didn't attend the fundraiser, I was going there to hand in information to tell them I was no longer going to volunteer for the campaign -- Hillary personally threatened me.HANNITY: Let me go back to the assault. You're saying you were a nurse at the time, correct?BROADDRICK: Yes.HANNITY: And you wanted him to be governor.BROADDRICK: Yes.HANNITY: At that time.BROADDRICK: Oh, yes.HANNITY: You were working for his campaign.BROADDRICK: Right.HANNITY: So he invited you for coffee.BROADDRICK: Yes. It was a long story. After he made a campaign tour around to my nursing home, I was trying to explain to him, Sean, about what the nursing homes were going through. The reimbursement method was -- it was horrible. And he seemed genuinely interested. He wanted to hear what I had to say. So he said, if you're ever in Little Rock again, he said, call me, let's get together and talk about these things.And as you know, we were supposed to meet in the coffee shop at the hotel where I was staying. When he got to the hotel, he called and asked if we could meet in the room instead. This was the attorney general. I didn't fear anything would happen.HANNITY: And you went up to the room?BROADDRICK: No, I was already in the room.HANNITY: Yes.BROADDRICK: I had sent my friend that was with me, one of my employees, Norma Kelsey, on down to the meeting. And I said, when I get through at the meeting, I will be -- I mean get through at the coffee shop with Bill Clinton, I'll be right on to the meeting. And of course, I never showed up.HANNITY: And this was a violent sexual attack.BROADDRICK: Yes.HANNITY: And when it was over, there was this moment you told me the first time I interviewed you, that he said to you, as he's walking out the door.BROADDRICK: He says you better get some ice on that, referring to my lip, which was bleeding and at least, by that time, was four times the size that it should be. I was frightened he was going to bite my lip off.HANNITY: And you immediately told your friend what happened?BROADDRICK: Yes. She came to the room when I didn't show up for the meeting.HANNITY: Yes.BROADDRICK: And she just came out here approximately two to three weeks ago -- she's been frightened to come out -- and told, you know, to the Breitbart people the condition that she found me in.And it's just -- when I re-read what she told from back then, it was painful to even hear it from her again, you know, how she found me. You know, I knew how I was, but it was hard.HANNITY: You told her. Did you tell other people at the time too?BROADDRICK: Yes, about four to five others.HANNITY: And they have all corroborated your story.BROADDRICK: Yes.HANNITY: You told them at the time.BROADDRICK: Yes.HANNITY: But he was the attorney general. You were afraid to speak publicly or report it?BROADDRICK: Oh, he could close the doors of my business, yes. They say, but why didn't you go to the police? He was the police. He was the main person in Arkansas, the attorney general, and then he became the governor.HANNITY: What about this run-in you had with Hillary? How long after the event? It was three weeks?BROADDRICK: It's about three weeks.HANNITY: And what happened? And she --BROADDRICK: OK.HANNITY: -- they were married at the time.BROADDRICK: Yes. I went up early to the fundraiser. Everybody misquotes and says, but why did she go to a fundraiser? I did not go to a fundraiser. I had about three or four checks, a list of people that were going to donate to the campaign, and when I was clearing out everything for the campaign, I just -- I found these. And I knew that the lady from Little Rock was going to be there that night. I could give these to her and be done with it and explain to her, I don't want to be in the campaign any longer, something like my business is taking too much of my time, something to that effect.So I did give her these things. And then just when we were starting to leave, about 20 minutes before the fundraiser began, a gentleman, a pharmacist in the area, who was very much for Bill Clinton but didn't know my story -- he didn't know anything -- he came over to me and was so excited because he said the topic of the conversation the entire way from the airport was Bill and Hillary Clinton asking questions about you.So that's when I turned to my friend and I said, let's go. But a few steps away, here comes Hillary, straight to me.HANNITY: Beeline to you.SHELTON: Beeline. She comes straight to me and says to me, big smile, very pleasant voice, says to me, I'm Hillary Clinton, it's so nice to meet you. I just want to thank you for everything that you do for Bill's campaign. And I was just going to turn and leave. I nodded, was going to leave.And then I feel somebody grabbing my arm and I thought it was somebody behind me, and it was her and she pulls me back close to her. And she pulls me in to her --HANNITY: Forcefully, in a way, pulled you?BROADDRICK: Yes, oh, yes. With one hand of hers, she's got my hand; with the other hand, she's got my arm. And she pulls me in close to her. And, of course, that very sweet voice fades to a very angry voice, a very low voice. And she pulls me close to her and she says, do you understand everything you do? And that just scared me to death.HANNITY: And you took that to mean she knew?BROADDRICK: I've always thought that. People come back to me and say, well, how do you know that's what she meant? You would have had to have been there. You would have to have been standing where I was and that woman looking straight in my eyes, very angrily saying that to me. I felt like, at that moment, she knew everything and was saying, you better keep quiet. There's just nothing that can change my mind.HANNITY: Wow. You don't recover from something like this. You would --BROADDRICK: No. No. No. It's been hard. I've had a good life, you know. I have a good family, I have a wonderful church, I have wonderful friends, but this just stays there in the back of your mind. You can't ever get rid of something like that.HANNITY: You recently were quoted saying you're afraid if she becomes president. Why?BROADDRICK: Oh, definitely.HANNITY: Because of --BROADDRICK: Yes.HANNITY: -- you don't know what she's capable of or --BROADDRICK: I don't know what she's capable of. I know what she's done to me in the past, but I don't know what she's capable of.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And coming up, part two of my interview with Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Willey. Plus, we're going to get reaction to my exclusive interview with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Mercedes Schlapp, and Doug Schoen. All coming up tonight, right here on HANNITY.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PATRICIA STARK, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Patricia Stark. The U.S. death toll from Hurricane Matthew continues to rise. Two more fatalities are being reported tonight in North Carolina, which is still facing widespread flooding days after the storm pummeled the southeast. At least 38 were killed on the U.S. main land.At the same time, international aid has begun flowing into parts of Haiti that were initially left inaccessible by Matthew. The government says that at least 500 people were killed by the hurricane.Well, attempts by Judicial Watch to dig up new information about Hillary Clinton's use of her private e-mail server while Secretary of State have not uncovered much so far. Clinton's legal team did file written responses to 25 questions posed by the conservative watchdog group, but most of Clinton's answers were objections to the inquiries or claims she couldn't recall the specifics of her e-mail setup.I'm Patricia stark. And now, back to ""Hannity.""HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" Here's part two of my interview with three of Bill Clinton's accusers, Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Willey. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Paula, your case, resulting in the impeachment of Bill Clinton --JONES: Right.HANNITY: -- you got an $850,000 settlement as a result of your case. Tell us your story. He was the attorney general then at the time.JONES: No, he was the governor.HANNITY: He was the governor at that time?JONES: No, he was the governor --HANNITY: OK.JONES: -- at the time.HANNITY: I apologize.JONES: And I was asked to work the governor's quality management conference with another lady there from the office. It was at a hotel. It was called the Excelsior Hotel at the time. The governor was late, and I think he was notoriously late a lot of times. He was known for that. And he came up and the little local press was trying to give him an interview and everything. And it was out in front of us, out in front of our table.HANNITY: Right.JONES: Well, he kind of like -- he was kind of staring at us, starting at me and my coworker, a lot. And then he -- you know, after all of that, that he went in and we were out there and the state police, his security, was there hanging out with us. And later that day, before the end of it, he came over and he said, the governor would like to meet with you.I didn't know why but I was excited. And he said, it's okay, we do this all the time. Well, that made me feel comfortable. I knew he was a state police. He had a gun. I thought, well, nothing is going to happen. I mean, they're going to be, you know --HANNITY: Right.JONES: I'm going to be safe. So he took me up there to the room. I walked in and we introduced ourselves, whatever, and --HANNITY: Just you, not your friend?JONES: No, I was by myself. No.HANNITY: Yes.JONES: She never was asked to go up there.HANNITY: Just you?JONES: I was by myself, escorted up to the room, with the state police who was his security. We did some small talk and then he started kind of getting a little comfortable and trying to -- he said that he loved the way my hair flowed down my back, of my clothes, and he liked my curves. And then I'm like, at that point that was -- I didn't know what to do. I mean, this is a governor telling me this stuff.HANNITY: Where was the security guard at this point?JONES: He was still outside. It was just me and him in the room. And I went on over to try to -- I'm thinking, what -- how can I do to distract him? How can I do to distract this situation? And I knew he was sitting out there. I knew he had a gun. And so, at this point in time, I'm getting a little nervous.So I walked over to the window and I was looking out at the river. I said, oh my, this is a beautiful view from, you know, up here at the river. And so he said yes, yes, you know, kind of trying to small talk, you know, me.  And then he leaned up and he pulled me up towards him and he was going to try to kiss on me. And so then I tried to distract him again.I was trying to -- and I thought, what am I doing? My mind is racing so fast that I don't realize what was even going on. You know what I'm saying? It's like, this is not happening. And I said, well, I may need to be going or something.And next thing you know, he pulled down his -- he sat down, pulled down his pants, his whole -- everything, and he was exposed. And I said, I'm not that kind of girl and I need to be getting back to my desk.HANNITY: And did you walk out then?JONES: Oh, I was trying to. And then, when he -- by the time he got his pants up and everything, I was trying to walk out. He rushed over and he grabbed the door facing so I couldn't get out and he said, you're a smart girl. Let's keep this between ourselves. And, of course, I didn't have any intentions of really telling anybody. I was scared at that point. I walked out and the trooper was sitting there with a smirk on his face.HANNITY: It's pretty amazing now when you go back in retrospect and people, I think, are hearing this a lot for the first time. Kathleen, this was the worst day of your life. You had -- like all of you, you were supporting Clinton.At this point now, he's in the white House. He's the President of the United States. You were going through a troubled time and your husband has some financial issues and you want a job. And he knew you well enough that he gave you an appointment in the Oval Office with him, correct?WILLEY: Right. We were friends.HANNITY: Right.WILLEY: We had served Virginians for Clinton, and we gave him office space in our law suit. We raised an awful lot of money for him. And I helped arrange, organized, the inaugural. I mean, we were all in for the Clintons.And it was the Monday after Thanksgiving. My husband had gotten himself into a lot of trouble, financially, and it could have -- he could have been disbarred, and it could have led to some serious, you know, legal problems.  And I just told my family that I was going to go to the White House the following Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving, and ask to see the president and ask for a job.By the time I got in to see him, Bill Clinton, I was in a real state and I was crying. And I sat down in the Oval Office with him at his desk and he said, I know you're upset. Would you like to -- I have a little private kitchen in the back. Would you like some coffee? And I said yes. I mean, like you, I didn't see anything wrong with that at all.And so we went back there and he fixed me coffee and he said, let's go in here to my little private study where we can have more privacy. Well, where do you get more privacy than the Oval Office, when you think about it? But, anyway, he went in, and he sat down on the sofa or chair and everything.And I never sat down. I leaned up against the doorjamb and I proceeded to tell him what was going on. And that, I said I can't volunteer anymore. I needed a job. And I knew I had a very short window, so I'm spitting it all in as quickly as I can. And I kept saying, I know you're busy, I know you have another meeting waiting for you, thank you for seeing me, I better go.And I headed back out to the hall to go back to the door that led into the Oval Office, and he took my coffee cup from me and put it on a desk or a table. And the next thing I knew, he had me backed into a corner and, you know, hands all over me, trying to kiss me, whispering in my ear, you know.  And I was like you, what do you do? I mean, what do you do? And I'm --JONES: It's like out of your body.WILLEY: And my mind was racing. And I thought, should I slap him or should I kick him or --JONES: Hurt him or run.WILLEY: -- or knee him, or, you know, what do I do? Scream? And you know, is Secret Service going to come in and descend upon me with guns? I mean, you don't know.HANNITY: How long did this go on for?WILLEY: God, it seemed like it was forever but, you know, maybe -- God, four or five minutes, maybe.HANNITY: And so he's groping, grabbing --WILLEY: Right, right.HANNITY: -- touching, fondling?WILLEY: Right, right.HANNITY: Kissing?WILLEY: And he's a big man, you know.HANNITY: Yes.BROADDRICK: Right.JONES: Yes.WILLEY: And I'm not big -- and I'm little, you know. And I'm trying to get out. And I'm trying to do it with some dignity because it's still the president, you know. And I'm still thinking what is he doing? He's still the president and I'm stuck here, and what do I do? What do you do?HANNITY: How did you get out?WILLEY: There was one slight moment of distraction and I got out of there.  I got out of there as fast as I could.HANNITY: All three of you in your own way have said you fear Hillary being the president.JONES: Absolutely.HANNITY: Why?JONES: Why wouldn't we? There's been so many things happen to so many people that are connected to the Clintons. And we are --HANNITY: You fear for your life?JONES: Absolutely I feel that way if she becomes the president. She's going the rule the world.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And coming up, reaction to our exclusive interviews with Kathy Shelton, Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Willey. We'll check in with Judge Janine Pirro, Mercedes Schlapp, and Doug Schoen. They're next.Plus, Trump is holding nothing back on the campaign trail. Today he reacted to new allegations that were brought against him. That and more straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" Now, we reached out to the Clinton campaign for comment about Kathy Shelton and Bill Clinton's thee accusers, and they actually provided us with a statement that they released before the second presidential debate. They attacked Donald Trump's campaign in stating that Hillary Clinton is, quote, ""prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way."" We also reached out to President Bill Clinton's office as well for comment, never heard back.Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor Mercedes Schlapp, former Clinton pollster, Fox News contributor, Doug Schoen, the host of ""Justice,"" Judge Jeanine Pirro. You were there for the Kathy Shelton interview in particular. I looked over at you. You were mad. I know you.JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO: You do know me. Look, I spent 30 years prosecuting child molesters, pedophiles, rapists. Kathy Shelton's story took me back to the courtrooms where these horrors that young girls who were victimized by these predators, and in this case the predator represented by Hillary Clinton, who laughs about the fact that, you know, he passed a lie detector and ha-ha, he got away with it.And then there's the thing that's very curious to me, Sean, and that is the inability for the defense to have enough evidence to test. And I have to wonder whether or not there is more evidence, more information to suggest that there might have been more there initially but not enough subsequently.And also the claim where she trashed the victim, and this is what defense attorneys do. Women who promote other women and say that they fight for women's rights and children's rights don't trash a sixth grader raped into a coma for five days saying that she seeks the company of men like her rapist and that she's emotional unstable. This is horrific, and Kathy Shelton took me back to those days as a prosecutor.HANNITY: When you hear her say he passed a lie detector, of course, which forever destroys my faith in lie detectors and laughs, that is brutal.DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I have a couple reactions. First, Roy Reid who was the interviewer says the laughs did not have anything to do with that. I wasn't there. All I can --HANNITY: It's transparent, the callousness, the casualness of it.SCHOEN: I've heard the tape. She was a public defender doing her job.  Maybe it was callous and maybe it was wrong, but I can tell you this, it has nothing to do with how this election will be decided.HANNITY: What do you think Mercedes if she's the champion of women's rights, is that how you champion women's rights, by smearing and slandering them and trying and working and using every skill at your disposal to get off somebody you believe is guilty?MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WASHINGTON TIMES: Well I think Hillary Clinton made this decision that all focus is going to be on Donald Trump, and obviously with the audio tape that came out about the groping. And this is her political play, Sean. So there is no room in the media chaos other than in certain outlets to talk about Kathy Shelton and to talk about these other women actually who were sexually assaulted and raped by a former president, her husband Bill Clinton, who happens to be a key adviser and a primary surrogate for Hillary Clinton.HANNITY: Mercedes, WikiLeaks is showing us that the media is an extension of Clinton. And interestingly, I think the most telling thing that Juanita, Paula, and Kathleen said tonight was they've never been asked to be interviewed this entire election cycle. Not one time.SCHLAPP: Right. And I think it just shows where the media, they've made their decision, Sean. They want to go with Hillary. They want to destroy Donald Trump. That is why WikiLeaks is getting not even getting close to the coverage of what we're seeing Donald Trump and all these sexual allegations against him. It is now becoming the politics of sex and not about issues.HANNITY: We've got to talk a break. More with our panel coming up right after this.And also coming up next tonight --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: These vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump fighting back against allegations made against him.  And then later, WikiLeaks releases 2,000 more emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager. We're going to show you what they say, those new revelations and much more tonight as ""Hannity"" continues.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: So now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton machine and The New York Times and other media outlets as part of a concerted, coordinated, and vicious attack.  These vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false. We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time very soon.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump earlier today on the campaign trail responding to allegations made against him. We continue with Mercedes Schlapp, Doug Schoen and Judge Jeanine Pirro. In the middle of a WikiLeaks dump that shows basically the media is in a tank, NBC, ABC, Washington Post, New York Times, Boston Globe, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, all these people in the media, they ignored the women we are talking about tonight but they go after these women, and lo and behold it comes out in the middle of the WiliLeaks dump. Coincidence?PIRRO: This is obviously something that was planned. They held onto it.  We know they held on to that audio so they could then overcome in some sense what was going on with WiliLeaks.And you know, I think about when you were talking about the media, they are supposed to be the fourth estate. They're supposed to keep us all honest.  Not only are they in the tank, but forevermore in this country Americans cannot look at the media as an objective, fair, and honest group of people who are looking out for us.HANNITY: Just pretend -- I know this will be hard. Pretend you're a Donald Trump supporter right now. And you see the coordination.SCHOEN: Sure.HANNITY: You see the collusion.SCHOEN: Yes.HANNITY: Every major news outlet and the Clinton campaign.SCHOEN: I do.HANNITY: And you're a Trump supporter. What are you thinking?SCHOEN: Here's what I'm thinking. All of this is a distraction. All of this takes away attention from the secretary's low approval rating, 60 percent don't trust her, don't think she's fit. But the Clintons, as I've said here many times, play seriously, they play to win. They spend what they need to do.HANNITY: They play dirty. You didn't say that. They play dirty.SCHOEN: Look, they play to win.HANNITY: That means playing dirty.SCHOEN: You can characterize that how you want.HANNITY: Mercedes, go ahead.SCHLAPP: They play dirty.I think for the Clintons, look, Sean, they're winning the narrative right now. They're winning the narrative with women, with suburban moms, with older women. The mere fact that they have been able to shift the focus on Donald Trump and these alleged sexual --HANNITY: What is he supposed to do if the media is against him, the Republicans are against him, and the Democrats are against him, what is he supposed to do?SCHOEN: Spend money.SCHLAPP: Besides spending money --SCHOEN: Big money.PIRRO: You know what, Mercedes, I agree with Doug. He has got to get his message out there. He's got to fight the media. He is not winning this fight right now.SCHLAPP: Right. But ever --SCHOEN: What I would tell him in private, put up $200 million. Run your message on spots if you're serious about winning, and do not stop.SCHLAPP: Every day you're talking about fighting the party, and every day you're talking about --SCHOEN: The Clintons aren't stopping. They're not going to stop.PIRRO: They fight to win.HANNITY: More WikiLeaks released another 2,000 e-mails allegedly belonging to once again Clinton campaign chairman Joe Podesta. We'll explain what the documents reveal now as our panel responds straight ahead.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So WikiLeaks released another 2,000 damning e-mails allegedly from the personal account of campaign chairman John Podesta. Revelations, well, they have not been good for the Democratic nominee. We continue with Mercedes Schlapp, Doug Schoen, Judge Jeanine. You want to go back to the women. You wanted to say something.PIRRO: The three women, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey as well as Paula Jones, what people don't say about them, Sean, is that there is corroboration. All they say about Juanita Broaddrick is that she recanted.  First of all, I've prosecuted rape cases for 30 years. They recant. But what they don't say is that, number one, Juanita Broaddrick was found with ripped clothes, ripped nylons, a swollen face by her roommate. The people came to her immediately. She said, yes, I was raped. Then when the state police from Arkansas came she recanted, but then with the feds she said it was true, absolute corroboration. The same with Kathy Willey, corroboration by her friends, immediate outcry.HANNITY: Paula Jones was able to identify distinguishing characteristics.PIRRO: Fight, there is corroboration.SCHOEN: And none of that matters. It's the secretary who is on the ballot. Not Bill Clinton. And when the allegations that Jeanine is making were put publicly in 98, Bill Clinton was at his highest levels of approval.PIRRO: Because it was the secretary of state who destroyed those women.HANNITY: You say it matters but you're saying --SCHOEN: I'm saying if you want to win the election, you use issues like immigration, free trade, economy, and focus.SCHLAPP: Doug, Hillary is not talking about the issues. Let's be real.  What she's talking about is keep pushing forward these stories on Donald Trump.SCHOEN: She should.SCHLAPP: It worked. It's a working strategy for the Clintons right now.  And so Donald Trump, he needs to go back, I think, to the kitchen table issue and saying we're getting all distracted by all this controlled media.PIRRO: Do you know what else? Christians and Catholics in this country need to be outraged about this.HANNITY: Let's talk about infiltrating.SCHOEN: But you need a strategy, you needed targeting communication, and you need money. So far Donald Trump has none of it.PIRRO: He needs to spend it.SCHOEN: He's not serious.PIRRO: Yes. He is.  SCHOEN: No, he isn't. You have to put up money, Jeanine.PIRRO: Put your money where your mouth is.SCHOEN: I do. I always do.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Coming up, we have more ""Hannity"" right after this break. Please stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Unfortunately that is all the time we have left this evening. As always, thank you for being with us. We hope you'll set your DVR so you never miss an episode, 10:00 eastern. And we'll see you here tomorrow night, Friday night. Have a great night.
