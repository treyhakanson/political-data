Rick Scott: We shouldn't turn Zimmerman verdict into politics	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" July 15, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.STUART VARNEY, GUEST HOST: Welcome, everyone. I'm Stuart Varney, in for Neil Cavuto, and this is ""Your World."" And Fox on top of the fallout over the Zimmerman verdict. While most of the protests have remained peaceful, some have not. In Oakland, California, angry demonstrators setting fires, breaking windows, burning the American flag. In New York, thousands of protesters taking to the streets, blocking traffic, and virtually shutting down Times Square.Ground zero in all of this, Sanford, Florida, where the verdict came down. To Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott who is appealing for calm.You have calm in Florida, Governor.GOV. RICK SCOTT, R-FLA.: Yes, we do.But, look, I'm a father, I'm a grandfather. Our heart goes out to the Trayvon Martin family. Losing a 17-year-old son, your heart goes out to them. I met the parents, sat down with them. Introduced them to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and let them know I was bringing in a special prosecutor.Look, your heart goes out to them. I'm thankful for those jurors. That's a tough trial, and to go through all that and deliberate, it's tough.VARNEY: What's your reaction to the Justice Department suggesting it could bring criminal federal charges? If it did, that would bring the whole thing back again.SCOTT: Well, they have got to make a decision on their own.(CROSSTALK)VARNEY: How would you respond if they said, yes, we're going ahead with a federal criminal probe?SCOTT: Sure. I would have to look at it at the time.But I think everybody ought to focus now on what happened to that family. They lost a son. I am appreciative of the jurors, I'm appreciative of how the Trayvon Martin family has handled it, and I'm glad we have a jury system, and I'm thankful for that.VARNEY: Now, back in March of 2012, right after the event, the president made a statement -- went in front of the cameras and made a statement about the Trayvon Martin case -- and right after the verdict was delivered, he made another statement which I will quote from in a moment.But, first, do you think that the president inserted himself into the judicial system? Because that has been the subject of some criticism.SCOTT: Sure. I don't know if he did or didn't. What I just think about is, I think about the family, I think about the fact we have a jury system and I'm appreciative of that. Those six women jurors, that was a tough trial. They deliberated. It's hard. Angela Corey, a very tough prosecutor.VARNEY: She is being criticized heavily.SCOTT: But she is a tough prosecutor, one of the toughest in the nation.VARNEY: Did she overcharge?SCOTT: Oh, I don't know, but she's a tough prosecutor.But, look, the Martin family lost a son. Let's mourn that son. You feel sorry for them. As a father and a grandparent, I really feel sorry for them.VARNEY: Let me quote to you from President Obama's statement, which he issued right after the verdict was announced.He said: ""We should ask ourselves if we are doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves as individuals and as a society how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon Martin.""What do you make of that statement?SCOTT: Well, we shouldn't turn this into politics.This was a tragedy. That family has been hurt forever. We shouldn't turn this into politics.VARNEY: Do you think that the president, though, was maybe calling for Florida to take a second look at stand your ground, that law?SCOTT: Well, here's what I did.Once this -- the Trayvon Martin case happened, I put together a bipartisan commission and we went through -- or they went through and looked at it, and their recommendation is we not make any changes, that it's working the way it was intended.VARNEY: And you're going with that?SCOTT: Absolutely.VARNEY: Will you make any changes of any kind to the judicial system or to the rules and regulations in place following this trial and the verdict?SCOTT: Well, here -- with stand your ground, I had a task force and their recommendation is we not make any changes.VARNEY: OK. And Florida is calm as we speak.SCOTT: Absolutely.Look, we have a great state. People care about each other in our state. We're at a 42-year low in our crime rate. Our sheriffs and our police chiefs, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, they do a great job.VARNEY: Did you take special precautions?SCOTT: Absolutely.VARNEY: You knew the verdict would be coming down. You moved people in place to keep a lid on things?SCOTT: Absolutely. Absolutely. We have great sheriffs and police chiefs.VARNEY: Was there any suggestion at any time that the lid would blow? I hate to put it like that, but...SCOTT: We're a state that it's challenging, but we have had challenges in our state, and we -- law enforcement did a good job, the pastors did a good job, our communities did a good job.VARNEY: OK.Let me turn to the issue of the National Guard. I believe they're going to be furloughed because of sequester cuts in your state just as hurricane season comes along.SCOTT: Boy, it doesn't make any sense.VARNEY: Can you stop it?SCOTT: Well, I'm trying.So, they do sequestration. They say they're going to cut hours of our National Guard. Now, think about this. These are individuals that have gone over and defended our freedom in Afghanistan, Iraq, and putting their lives at risk and now we're going to cut their pay 20 percent. That's not right.On top of that, it's during hurricane season. We gave them other ideas where they never had to furlough one of our troops. They said no. We give them ideas of how they could to do it outside of hurricane season. And they said no.Tomorrow, I'm going to have a conversation with the Department of Defense, and hopefully they're going to say, you know what, we made a mistake. We're not going furlough your National Guard during hurricane season.VARNEY: In the back of your mind, is there a suspicion that you are a Republican, a Republican governor, in a very important state, and this administration is not going to help you out by abandoning the furlough of National Guard people in hurricane season?SCOTT: Boy, you would hope not. You would hope...VARNEY: In the back of your mind do you think that?SCOTT: Well, you hope not, though.Think about it. These are individuals that are going to have a 20 percent compensation cut like that. Second, if we have a hurricane, they're going to be responsible for making sure our National Guard was not prepared for the hurricane. Would you want to do that? Even if you wanted to play politics, you wouldn't do that.VARNEY: How about jobs? I know you...SCOTT: Jobs, jobs, jobs, 330,000 jobs --VARNEY: That's what you want to talk about, OK.SCOTT: 330,000 jobs in a little over two years. Big turnaround, below the national average in unemployment, 7.1 percent.VARNEY: Your whole face just lit up.(CROSSTALK)SCOTT: Absolutely. I ran on jobs, Stuart.VARNEY: Yes, you did.SCOTT: Seven steps to 700,000 jobs. We're almost halfway there after 2.5 years.VARNEY: 330,000 jobs, but are they solid, full-time jobs? We hear a lot about part-time jobs being created because of ObamaCare.SCOTT: Sure. Absolutely.They're not -- of course, every job is not full-time. But, look, we're back to work, 7.1 percent unemployment, below the national average. The four years before I became governor, the state lost 832,000 jobs. We're a right-to-work state. No personal income tax. A low business tax. So we have gotten rid of regulation. I have attracted companies like Hertz, Northrop Grumman is expanding, AT&T is expanding, Verizon is expanding, Boeing is expanding. So I have done nine trade delegations around the world. And we're getting jobs in our great state.VARNEY: How many jobs was that again, Governor?SCOTT: Well, 330,000 jobs, 7.1 percent unemployment, on the way down.(LAUGHTER)VARNEY: Your eyes just lit up.All right, Governor Scott, thanks for joining us, sir.SCOTT: Nice seeing you.VARNEY: Appreciate it.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2011/05/06/rob-lowe-discusses-politics-hollywood/	Rob Lowe Discusses Politics in Hollywood	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" May 6, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the ""Personal Story"" segment tonight: Not much reaction from the Hollywood liberal community about the death of bin Laden. We sincerely hope they know about it. And one liberal actor who has moved to the center recently is Rob Lowe. He is the author of the brand-new bestseller ""Stories I Only Tell My Friends."" I spoke with him earlier this week.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)O'REILLY: You say in your book that Hollywood is a one-party town. We all know that. It's a liberal Democrat town. Is there a reason for that?ROB LOWE, ACTOR: I think that -- and I don't know what it says, it's not meant to be a judgment -- but it seems to me like creative people end up being Democrats. I think it's been that way forever.O'REILLY: Is that because they feel sorry for the downtrodden or something? I consider myself a creative person. I'm kind of more of a traditional guy than a liberal guy.LOWE: Look, let's face it. I think that Democrats are very long on empathy.O'REILLY: Right.LOWE: Artists have to be long on empathy. Republicans are long on logic, in my view.O'REILLY: OK. That might be a little oversimplifying it.LOWE: But no, I was trying to simplify.O'REILLY: I just think there is a peer pressure kind of thing out there that when you get into the business, everybody is one way, that pretty much you have got to go that way.LOWE: Well, listen, everybody can relate to growing up at the kitchen table and hearing your parents talk only one view.O'REILLY: You did work for Dukakis...LOWE: I did.O'REILLY: ...when you were 24.LOWE: Right.O'REILLY: Dukakis was an OK guy, but he was a very liberal guy and he got his butt kicked, as you know. Was that because you were working for him, by the way?LOWE: I can pick them, but I also worked for Schwarzenegger and he won.O'REILLY: What happened to him?LOWE: He took on the entrenched party system in California.O'REILLY: And got his butt kicked. He got terminated by them. They killed him. Look, I don't think Arnold knew what he was getting into. I really don't. I think he tried, but I don't...LOWE: I disagree. I have never met a person who can't -- who is less good or better at bringing people together than Arnold. He is amazing at it.O'REILLY: He can bring it together, but he left office with a 25 percent approval rating. It was just you guys that liked him.LOWE: I'm the 25 percent? Just me?O'REILLY: You and your pals out there, Lowe. Come on.LOWE: It's a very divisive state. They say if you are a centrist in California, you get run over.O'REILLY: Yes, that's for sure.LOWE: By the way, that's too bad. Because I think in the center is where we should be because all of us agree on a lot.O'REILLY: Now, one of the fascinating points in your book is your relationship with guys like Sean Penn and Charlie Sheen. But Penn and Sheen are two of the most flamboyant, crazy, controversial guys. Were they that way as kids growing up? Did you know they were going...LOWE: That's what makes them great. That's part of what makes them who they are.O'REILLY: But look, Sheen is self-destructing. Don't you feel bad for him?LOWE: I have a particular perspective. I have known him since he was 13. It's like talking about one of your true childhood...O'REILLY: Were you close friends with him?LOWE: Very close.O'REILLY: Are you still close friends with him?LOWE: I still consider myself close. We don't talk as much as we have in the past.O'REILLY: You kicked the addiction thing, right? You were a boozer, right?LOWE: Twenty one years this...O'REILLY: Good for you. But he seems to embrace that kind of a culture still.LOWE: Yes.O'REILLY: Do you talk to him about that?LOWE: I do. He is not interested in recovery, which worked for me. It's worked for millions of people.O'REILLY: Did it take you a long time to get there, where you wanted to be cured?LOWE: I was ready when I was ready. That was my blessing.O'REILLY: So maybe that will happen to Sheen? Maybe he'll wise up.LOWE: He's not ready.O'REILLY: Now, Penn is a very left-wing guy. He was at the correspondents' dinner on Saturday night. He wouldn't put his hand over his heart during the ""Star Spangled Banner.""LOWE: Really? Come on.O'REILLY: He wouldn't.LOWE: You are making that up.O'REILLY: No, I'm not. I would never make anything up on this program. Never. I tell you the truth and you know that. You watch. Was he that way when he was a kid? Did he have that anti-American chip on his shoulder?LOWE: The Sean that I know is hilarious, really, really smart and gets the joke, and is arguably our best actor.O'REILLY: But he's intense though, very intense guy when it comes to politics, very far left.LOWE: He's very, very much occupies that space.O'REILLY: Do you talk politics with Penn?LOWE: No.O'REILLY: That's a good thing, right? You don't want to get into that.LOWE: I'm a centrist. I don't want to get run over.O'REILLY: When people read this book, what do you want them to think about you when they are finished with the book?LOWE: What I wanted to do with the book was just try to make it emblematic of who I am and people can take away what they want.O'REILLY: Have you become more conservative as you get older?LOWE: Without a doubt. I mean, I am a centrist. My son, who is studying politics in high school, had me take some online very complicated poll. You couldn't have put me more in the middle than where I ended up, and I don't know what that says about me, but that's where I ended up.O'REILLY: One thing it says about you is that you are very wise not to talk politics with Sean Penn. Thanks for coming in here, Mr. Lowe. Good to meet you.LOWE: Thank you. You, too.(END VIDEOTAPE)Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, Inc. Copyright 2011 Roll Call, Inc.
