'Special Report' Panel on Politics, Elections and World Affairs

"	"This is a rush transcript of ""Special Report With Brit Hume"" from December 20, 2007. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE HUCKABEE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He ought to win, just by virtue of -- if you look at how much money, the resources, and everything, I mean, he ought to win. And that's what I'm saying: if we win, it would be a miracle.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, ""SPECIAL REPORT"" HOST: Well, I'm sure he didn't intend to low ball there. Mike Huckabee talking about Iowa where he and Mitt Romney are in a close race, one in which all the momentum in recent weeks, or virtually all of it, has been to Huckabee, with polls showing him ahead -- miracle, indeed.Some thoughts on this race now from Fred Barnes, Executive Editor of ""The Weekly Standard,"" Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, and Mort Kondracke, Executive Editor of ""Roll Call,"" FOX News contributors all.Let's look a couple of polls. These are national polls, and it is not at all clear how much they mean at this stage, but they will tell you something. First, the latest FOX News opinion dynamics poll shows that Rudy Giuliani is now at 20 percent. Back in November he was at 33.McCain is up a little from 17 to 19, Huckabee from 8 to 19 percent -- you can see where all of Giuliani's points went. Romney up a little, still at just at 11, and Fred Thompson has dropped a couple of points.That is, basically, the same trend shown in a similar poll from NBC news and The Wall Street Journal, where you can see that Giuliani and Romney are basically tied, Huckabee at 17, which is up quite a bit, McCain and Thompson where they are.But, Iowa, ABC/Washington Post poll out of Iowa -- this is the guy who says it would be a miracle if he wins. He is said to be at 35 percent, Romney trailing at 27. So, miracle, indeed.Mara, what do you sense is happening here?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: The guy is a good politician. It is always nice to set yourself up in case you win, it's a miracle. That's what he is doing.What is happening is that Huckabee has had this extraordinary rise. In the space of a couple of months he has gone from single digits to being the leader.And I think what has happened there a structural part of the vote in Iowa and it belongs to Christian conservatives. They took a very long time to settle on a candidate, and they finally settled on him -- estimates are up to about 40 percent of the Iowa Republican caucus vote.Now, I think that's what he is tapping into. That's what is responsible for his rise. A lot of people have tried to court them --HUME: Yes, he's at 35 percent. That's sounds about right.LIASSON: Yes. A lot of people have tried to court them, including mitt Romney, and it hasn't worked.Now, the thing to watch for is his rise is kind of organic. He doesn't have a lot of money to make to make an organization on the ground like mitt Romney does, who spent an estimated $7 million in Iowa alone on organization and on television advertising.So what we will find out on caucus night is whether this kind of organic movement, home-schoolers of evangelicals who are really excited for Huckabee turn out, or will Romney's what he calls ""super volunteers"" -- they're paid volunteers, and he has a big network of them -- will they do the trick for them?MORT KONDRACKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ""ROLL CALL"": And Huckabee is not only surging in Iowa, but he's now first in South Carolina as well, and he is second in even Florida and California. That's amazing.Whether it can last, who knows? But so far, there's been a lot of stuff thrown at Huckabee, especially by Romney, and he's going fast an furious on the immigration issue, on amnesty for prisoners and stuff, pardons and clemency, and stuff, and his tax record -- and it hasn't affected Huckabee yet.FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": I agree with that. You know, look, I haven't cut Huckabee much slack, but if he wins or even comes close, it is a miracle.HUME: In Iowa?BARNES: From where he came from? A month ago, he was nowheresville, and now he is leading Romney. That's a political miracle.HUME: You're talking about a miracle that's already occurred.BARNES: Yes.HUME: He's talking about a miracle that's about to occur.LIASSON: Yes, because -- (INAUDIBLE)BARNES: In any case, he's certainly -- look, he is rated -- if Romney beats him, he has certainly lowered expectations for Romney. If Romney wins, he will call it a miracle as well.But Huckabee is being hit pretty hard now, and I wouldn't expect it to affect the polls immediately. And just because there is some article on, you know, ""National Review Online"" or ""The Weekly Standard"" Web site that is critical of Huckabee, folks out in Iowa probably aren't reading that stuff. But they have heard Romney.And one thing is clear, Huckabee does not like to be criticized. He responds angrily, and he say ""Why is he doing that? It's wrong."" It's like it's unfair and your not allowed to do this in politics, attack the people who are running against you in an election.And he responds. He says he doesn't respond, but he does respond and criticizes Romney. The test will be if he runs ads attacking Romney. Certainly Romney has ads attacking him.KONDRACKE: The second thing that is important that has been happening is that Giuliani has been faltering. We have all said isn't it amazing that Giuliani continues to have a national lead in spite of social views, his personal life, Bernard Kerik.I think it is catching up with him, I really do.LIASSON: (INAUDIBLE)KONDRACKE: And the Bernard Kerik stuff. There has been a lot of -- Bernard Kerik got indicted --HUME: So you would suggest that there is a lead time from the day that the stuff begins to appear and builds to some kind of volume, and the time that it affects you.KONDRACKE: And if it seems to be validated over time. The story doesn't get knocked down, it doesn't go away. It keeps coming back and people keep talking about.HUME: How long can a guy in the person of Mike Huckabee, who clearly disagrees with the president of the United States and most of the Republican Party on foreign policy issues, who is clearly a man who has raised taxes with some regularity while governor of Arkansas, who is supported by the National Education Association, which is a bete noir of the Republicans, how long can a man like that remain on top of the polls?BARNES: They may not know what people are voting on. They may just be glad because he's a social conservative.The problem for Huckabee, though, is that most social conservatives are not just social conservatives. They tend to be economic conservatives and foreign policy conservatives as well.So I think it's quite possible for Romney or somebody else to cut into this Evangelical base that Huckabee has in Iowa. It doesn't seem to happen yet, but it might happen.HUME: There are polls from Rasmussen reports, and he polls with some regularity, that suggest that the Huckabee momentum, which was growing steadily, has at least slowed down or stopped. That doesn't mean he won't win, and it doesn't mean he isn't ahead. But, it means --LIASSON: But you have to look at the calendar. New Hampshire has less proportion of Evangelical. He can hop right to South Carolina where there is a fair amount of them. But on February 5 a lot of states with bigger parts of the population are not tailor made for him.HUME: Let's talk about that scenario for a second. There will be a tremendous big story about whoever wins Iowa.LIASSON: Right.HUME: Only a few days later we'll have New Hampshire. If he doesn't do well there, what happens to all that momentum? Will that carry over into New Hampshire or not?(CROSSTALK)KONDRACKE: He's got a strong base in South Carolina. Again, Christian conservatives are sustaining him in South Carolina. And wherever there is a large group of them, he will do OK.HUME: When we come back, the all stars will take a look at how the Democratic sweepstakes are shaping up. Don't go anywhere.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN HILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So you can ask the people of New York that when I tell you that I will help you, when I tell you I will fight for you, when I tell you I will give you my best effort, that's exactly what I do. That may sound hopelessly old fashioned, but that's who I am.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: I don't know if it was old fashioned or not, but, apparently, a lot of people believe that according to the new Fox News Democratic primary national poll, which shows that Hillary Clinton, who was thought to have been slipping, at least in early states, has been gaining in the national polls. She's up from 44 to 49.Barack Obama is thought to be down, and the same is true of John Edwards, at least marginally.So, if you look here at an ""ABC News/Washington Post"" poll on Iowa, you see Obama ahead by a few ticks. That's all margin of error stuff, we understand that.But look at Hillary Clinton on the question of favorable and unfavorable ratings. In November, she was rated favorably by 49 percent of the people. That's down to 45. And her unfavorables are at 49, and that's the highest of any candidate in the field.So kind of a mixed picture there for somebody who was so far ahead in the national polling.KONDRACKE: Well, she -- look, she has been playing the negative against Obama for a long time.She said the fun stuff was going to start, and the fun turned out to be a bunch of attacks on Obama's experience, on his drug use as a young man, on his allegedly being a Muslim -- somebody dribbled that out and it got a lot of circulation on the internet, and Bob Kerrey sort of mentioned it and then withdrew it. And it looked like --HUME: Bob Kerrey in the course of endorsing Hillary.KONDRACKE: And complimenting Obama ostensibly, saying he had gone to a secular madrassa -- HUME: A contradiction in terms.KONDRACKE: Exactly.In any event, it was unrelieved negativism on the part of the Clinton campaign. Some of it was on purpose, some of it maybe not on purpose, but, nonetheless, she gets the blowback from that.Now she is on the likability tour. And she has got all these friends of hers who have been friends of hers for life, and they're going around with her attesting to what a great person she is.HUME: She did every national morning show in America, all the networks plus all the cable channels one day this week. That's unusual for her.KONDRACKE: Three out of the four polls that have been conducted recently in Iowa indicate that she's in the lead. And all four of the last four polls that have been conducted in New Hampshire indicate she has a lead, and it is measured at about seven percent in New Hampshire.There is -- I'm told that every Monday morning there's a little poll that's conducted among the Hillary Clinton staff in Iowa, and the last poll among them indicated that they thought that Edwards was going to win. And, frankly, the Clinton people hope that Edwards wins if she doesn't, because if Edwards wins then Obama's momentum will be slowed.LIASSON: If she is number three? I don't think so. If she comes in third in Iowa, that will be a big setback for her. If she's second, that's different, and Obama third, of course I agree.BARNES: Was there a poll of the Edwards staff? Maybe a poll of the Obama staff? That's not a poll taken in American that I've heard of.Look, Hillary, I agree with everything you said, however. She's hurting. Sometimes it works, sometimes you have to do it. Sometimes you get blowback, and she is getting blowback.All these candidates have Christmas ads. I think you played a couple of days ago the one by Mike Huckabee, a very good ad. Hillary has one -- or I should say Senator Clinton has one -- and it shows her putting these things like ""alternative energy"" and ""troops coming home"" under the Christmas tree. It's pretty clumsy, I think.On the other hand, John Edwards has one talking about -- look, I'm not a John Edwards' fan -- but talking about not forgetting the poor and homeless and so on at this time of the year -- extremely good Christmas ad.LIASSON: Yes. I think what the Clinton campaign is worried about is a third place finish. I think they feel that she can withstand a second place finish if it's not too far back. She might even be able to call herself the comeback kid.HUME: Wait a minute, she is supposed to be ahead.LIASSON: In the ABC/Washington Post poll, but the point is -- HUME: The next thing you know she will be saying it will be a miracle if she wins.LIASSON: What's happening in Iowa, I think -- first of all, it's very, very hard to poll because it's hard to know who is going to show up to these caucuses. I think it's fair to say that it is a dead heat, even a three-way dead heat in Iowa. No poll has shown anyone ahead outside of the margin of error.BARNES: This likability thing is better if it comes naturally. Ronald Reagan was likable. Her husband, Bill Clinton, one of the most likable people in the world. You can fake it, but it's hard, and she's not doing a very good job.HUME: Well, so anybody got a forecast here? We're about to go into what presumably will be a lull here for the holidays.KONDRACKE: I think it is totally impossible to know who is going to win the Iowa caucuses on the Democratic side.HUME: Either party?KONDRACKE: I would say Huckabee looks like he will win on the Republican side.LIASSON: The interesting thing in the Republican race -- I think the movement in the national polls reflect something that is happening in the states. But in the Democratic race, the movement in the national polls: there is none. It's static. She is ahead, she has always been ahead. But she's slipped a lot.HUME: That's it for the panelContent and Programming Copyright 2007 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2007 Voxant, Inc.

'Special Report' Panel on Politics, Media and World Affairs

"	"This is a rush transcript of ""Special Report With Brit Hume"" from December 19, 2007. This copy(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ADI IGNATIUS, TIME DEPUTY MANAGING EDITOR: We picked President Putin as ""Person of the Year,"" and let me just quickly say it is not an honor. We're not saying he is a good person or a bad person. He is the person who has most affected the news in 2007 and going forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, ""SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRIT HUME"" HOST: They may not say he is a good person, but they did say this, and I quote ""Through an iron will, a clear vision of what Russia should become, and a sense that he embodied the spirit of mother Russia, Putin has put his country back on the map.""I wouldn't mind having somebody say that about me. But let's see what the all-stars think: Fred Barnes, Executive Editor of The Weekly Standard, Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of Nation Public Radio, and the syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, FOX News contributors all.We are given to understand, Fred, that in second place was Al Gore. J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books was third, Hu Jintao of China was fourth, and David Petraeus did manage to finish in fifth place. What does this say?FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": Just to make you feel better, I will say that you embody the spirit of mother America. So you said you would hope somebody would say something like that about you.Look, you can defend the naming Putin the ""Person of the Year,"" although I don't want to know what it means, what that Ignatius fellow said, the person who most affected the news. What does that mean? Is that the most newsworthy person, the most important person?If it just affected the news, I think Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, President Ahmadinejad of Iran affected the news a lot more than he did.And if you want somebody who's more important, I think that would be General Petraeus, who was pulled out of the jaws of defeat what looks like a victory in Iraq, and has changed both the Middle East, the war on Islamic jihadism, and the Bush presidency.That seems to me a bigger feat than stabilizing somewhat Russia, which you have to give Putin credit for. But the main thing that has happened that has helped Russia is the fact that oil and gas prices are so high.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think that's the reason --HUME: He has also de-democratized the place.LIASSON: He has de-democratized the place. His biggest feat is creating the situation where he can stay in power almost indefinitely and have another term when he really wasn't able to get one. But I don't think he affected the news more than anybody else. In another year you could say Usama Bin Laden affected the news.But I don't think that Russia is necessarily a major player. They do have oil and gas, and as long as that holds out, which it won't forever, as long as those prices stay high, he will be important. But I think you can make a pretty strong argument for putting other people on the cover.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Let's remember that Time made Hitler and Stalin man of the year back to back in 1938 and '39, which tells you that this honor is not an ideological endorsement, but it does tell you that Time has a history of a proclivity for strong men who make the trains run on time and who make omelets by breaking a lot of eggs.Putin isn't a mass murderer, but he is a guy who dismantled democracy. But the other thing here is that his influence has been spread over the eight years. The man who changed the world the most in this year is obviously Petraeus.In one year, he turned, as Fred said, a losing war into a winning war, a war of supreme importance to the United States, to the war on terror, to Iraq, and to the heartland of the Arab world. What is more important than that?His success is what changed the whole temperature in Washington, and without him, we would undoubtedly be in the middle now -- without him and the success he has had with the surge, his new strategy -- we would undoubtedly be in the middle of a humiliating withdrawal, a collapse of our authority in that region, and a victory that Al Qaeda had deeply coveted.I predict that in our lifetime, he will be president of the United States, assuming that we watch our diet and exercise.BARNES: Well, I certainly agree about Petraeus -- he stands alone.HUME: Could it be argued, though -- could an editor of Timesay, look, Petraeus did a good job of doing what he did, but the big thing was the change in sentiment among Iraqis themselves, noted first in Anbar province, where they turned against insurgency. Could you make that argument?BARNES: No, you couldn't credibly make that argument, because one of the reasons the whole Sunni awakening and turning against Al Qaeda -- obviously they decided they didn't like Al-Queda, they had experienced Al Qaeda -- but without the security offered buyer American forces, it would have died, and earlier awakenings like that had died in Iraq.So the American forces there were absolutely critical. It was Petraeus's strategy. It was his request for the certain number of additional troops. And it all happened in 2007. I don't know what more you want.If you want somebody who has done more over a period of years to revive their country, take the prime minister of India, Prime Minister Singh, who was the Finance Minister before that, and India has come from being a sluggish third world country to a country with a vibrant economy, and he's done a more amazing job with India than Putin has done with Russia.LIASSON: At least they put an actual person on the cover rather than a mirror, which is what they did last year when they named you, or us, each of us, as the ""Person of the Year.""HUME: Yes, I guess we got to be grateful of that. Charles, do you agree?KRAUTHAMMER: Yes. That was a lame choice.Putin is not an indefensible choice. He is very important. He may end up being the ""Man of the Decade"" for changing Russia's good fortunes. But in '07, clearly David Petraeus.HUME: When we come back with our panel, the White House versus The New York Times."" We will tell you what The Times wrote, why the White House didn't like it, and what happened. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today in The New York Times, it says conversations took place about the destructions of tapes, and it names Mr. Gonzales, Harriet Miers, David Aldington, and John Bellinger as being involved.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just this morning, in a regrettably familiar pattern, we learned that the involvement of senior administration officials seemed to be more significant than it appeared from their official denials.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: Well, in fact, they didn't make any initial denials. All that the White House ever said was that the president didn't find out about the tapes or destruction of them until much later, about the time all the rest of us found out about them.Dana Perino, the press secretary to the President, called out The New York Times about this and demanded a correction. The article that Senators Kennedy and Leahy seized upon is this one, and the subhead, as you can see there, ""White House role was wider than it said"" was the offending passage.Apparently the story didn't back up that part of the headline, and The Times has said that yes, it will make a correction of some kind. It claims to have done so already online although we looked for it and couldn't find it.So I guess you could say that The Times has done the right thing. But what gave rise to this? And I guess the Kennedy and Leahy comments show you that the impact of The New York Times can have on the scene in Washington.BARNES: They jumped right on it, no question about that. But I agree with it. I agree that Senator Leahy said this was a regrettably familiar pattern of The New York Times attacking the Bush administration unfairly in its news column.HUME: I don't think that's what he meant.BARNES: I don't think that is what he meant either, but it was a good quote. I thought I could seize on it, too.Anyway, it's not clear to me that there was a crime committed. I don't think they know that. They treat this as a scandal. Without doubt, I think in the normal course of events, the CIA would have and should have destroyed those tapes. If they had gotten into the wrong hands they could be very harmful to the United States. And let's wait and see, but --HUME: The only reporting that was done, and it wasn't based on anything that the White House put out, was to the effect that Harriet Miers who was then on the White House staff before she became the counsel, had counseled against the destruction of the tapes. This story does not say otherwise.BARNES: One other thing that's interesting, though, is how aggressively the Bush White House, feeling stronger now than it has in many, many months, I think, aggressively jumped all over The New York Times and went after them, I think rightly so.LIASSON: Well, it was pretty cut and dried. The New York Times said that the White House said something, but the White House hasn't said anything, as Dana Perino tried to explain. She is the voice of the White House, and she hasn't talked about it. As a matter of fact, she's refused to talk about it.HUME: Where did the press corps seem to come down on its behavior?LIASSON: The press corps is smelling a scandal and thinking there might be one.What is interesting about it, when you looked into the meat of the story, what they said is that there is now different accounts of what exactly went on in these meetings, not that some of these lawyers had argued for the destruction of the tapes, but that there were varying accounts, and they all weren't exactly the same in these discussions.HUME: Surprise, surprise.KRAUTHAMMER: What this story did is advanced the story in the sense that it added three names. We had known that Miers had had been involved in discussion, but it added someone who is now Chief of Staff to the Vice President, and poor Alberto Gonzales, who will be spending the rest of his life in front of committees and answering questions on all kinds of things.But what worries me is the alacrity with which Kennedy and Leahy jumped on this. It is clear that we are in another cycle of criminalizing policy differences.You can argue about whether the techniques that we had used are correct. I think yes. Others with deep conviction argue not. You can argue over whether it was ""torture"" or not, I'm indifferent to what word you use, others will argue it was.But we ought to be having arguments about what was done. What is going to happen instead is they are going to look for scapegoats to throw in jail and disbar the same way that Scooter Libby was made a scapegoat over the war in Iraq.This has happened for years in this town, and, really, it is a disgrace. Let's having arguments on principle and policy. But the pursuit of individuals to actually destroy them is a product of this, and it shouldn't be happening.BARNES: Indeed we have seen a lot of this. Scooter Libby is a good example. There are many other examples: the attempt to bring criminal charges against Karl Rove and others in this White House. You have two senators on the Judiciary Committee who immediately accept the subhead.HUME: It wasn't even in the story.BARNES: I know, but it was in the headline, and it is still The New York Times, and they accepted it as true and had a hearing on the basis of it.HUME: Well, they commented during a hearing.BARNES: Well, it was a big issue in that hearing -- the guy nominated for Deputy Attorney General.HUME: So where does this leave us, Mara?LIASSON: The Justice Department will do its own investigation of this. We do know that the CIA official who ordered the destruction of tapes had legal counsel before he did it, he just didn't just throw them in the garbage. And then we will find out what happened.Content and Programming Copyright 2007 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2007 Voxant, Inc.
