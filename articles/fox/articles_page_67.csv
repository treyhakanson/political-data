This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SHANNON BREAM, HOST: Breaking tonight. Millions are awaiting answers as we sit just minutes away from a major speech by Donald Trump.  Focusing on a cornerstone of his campaign. Immigration and border security.Welcome to ""The Kelly File."" I'm Shannon Bream in for Megyn Kelly.  Tonight's speech will take place in the border state of Arizona and comes just hours after Mr. Trump made a short and controversial trip to Mexico to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Behind closed doors, afterwards the two men delivered remarks. They addressed in key policy differences but also agreed that working together to stop illegal activity benefits both of our countries.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRES. ENRIQUE PENA NIETO, MEXICAN PRESIDENT (through a translator): We might disagree on several issues. But your presence here, Mr. Donald Trump, shows that we do have fundamental common ground. Mexican people had felt insulted by certain comments but I was certain that his genuine interest is to build a relationship that might lead us to provide both our societies better conditions.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Having a secure border is a sovereign right and mutually beneficial. We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, drugs, and weapons.  Cooperation toward achieving this shared objective, and it will be shared, of safety for all citizens is paramount to both the United States and to Mexico.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Our chief political correspondent campaign Carl Cameron is live in Phoenix at the site of the Trump speech standing by. Hi, Carl.  CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CAMPAIGN: Hi, Shannon. Big news made out of Mexico City, which has brought a tremendous amount of attention to tonight's speech. And for the most part, the Trump campaign was very pleased with the way things went but there was this flack at the very end where Mr. Trump said that they did discuss the wall and they didn't discuss who was going to pay for it. And then later in the day, the Mexican president himself said, actually, the very beginning of the meeting he said that Mexico was not going to pay for it.Democrats are jumping all over that suggesting that Trump now had its big event blow up for him. The truth of the matter is, it has brought attention to the podium behind me now where Trump will be speaking at about the bottom of the hour at 9:30 or so. He's in Phoenix now. He's returned from Mexico. And tonight is a speech that he has twice postponed but the campaign has been talking about for more than a month and a half. The big immigration policy speech to knit together all of his utterances over the last 16 months of being a presidential candidate and put it into actual policies that voters can chew over, look at debate and make a decision on.So, that's the deportation of some of the 11 million undocumented immigrants that are in the country now. That means dealing with visa overstays. That means dealing with the way in which he wants to secure the border. Will it be a wall from the Pacific Coast to the Gulf of Mexico?  Probably not. Trump has said that there are mountains that make it impractical in some places to build that wall and there would be technological means to secure the border.All of these things have caused a lot of consternation both for his critics and for his supporters in the last couple of weeks because it's appeared that he was wavering a little bit. And he did get one sort of sharp message from the Mexican president who has said that a lot of Mexicans were hurt by some of his rhetoric, having said that in the very early stages of campaign that Mexico was sending criminals and rapists and not their best.  Today, Donald Trump didn't apologize but it definitely changed his tone in talking about Mexicans. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The United States first, second and third generation Mexicans are just beyond reproach. Spectacular, spectacular hardworking people. I have such great respect for them and their strong values of family, faith and community.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAMERON: The Trump campaign says what we saw today was Donald Trump at his presidential best. Conducting diplomacy, meeting with a foreign leader on a stage that was set up the way world leaders normally do when it's the White House travel call a bilateral although Trump isn't an official officeholder but it was official and a great opportunity for him to bring it here with the speech tonight. And launch what we're told will be a much more clear enunciation of his foreign policy and domestic immigration policies -- Shannon.BREAM: Carl, it sounds like a lot of energy there in the room. People very fired up. Do they expect or have you heard from anybody what their expectations are about tonight? Do they think they'll hear something new?  Did they think there will be a continuing of this evolution of softening?  What is your sense?CAMERON: Well, when you talk to Trump supporters the types that come to the rallies here, these are very, very ardent supporters and time and again when most of the media has been pounding Trump for what they call flip flops or in some cases lies with relation to the not discussing who's going to pay for the wall today, they think that it's essentially media bias and that Democrats propagandizing against a politically incorrect inexperience politician who is now the Republican nominee and in an awful lot of polls, closing some of the gaps with Hillary Clinton. Are they enthusiastic?  Absolutely. Here in Arizona, particularly. This is a state that's been at the forefront of border security and immigration problems. They look at Donald Trump as somebody who's finally speaking their language -- Shannon.BREAM: All right, Carl, we'll check back with you as you keep an eye on that speech. Thank you very much.  And as we mentioned, there is been a lot of talk that Donald Trump is softening his position on illegal immigrants living here in the U.S. A brand new Fox poll finds that many of his own supporters aren't against that idea. Forty eight percent say, it would make them more likely to vote for him. Just 15 percent say they would be less likely to support him. At the needle, he's got a thread now tonight.Chris Stirewalt is our Fox News digital politics editor. And Chris, you wrote about this today talking about the fact that there was some risk involved with what Mr. Trump did today. The first part of this, two for immigration, the visit with Mexico's president, how do you think it went?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: It went great. He took a chance. He walked in to the lion's den. He did a good job. And he managed to get out essentially unscathed. Obviously, he's got to pay the price for it later as it relates to backing off Mexico building the wall, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But in terms of Donald Trump's rebranding, the remaking of himself for a sort of Labor Day reboot into the general election to try to get this race competitive, he did a good, good job.  BREAM: All right. I think that he could count success in this one way.  We're monitoring tweets that came in reaction afterwards, Bill Kristol, not a big Donald Trump fan said this today, hard when your challenger to seem presidential, Trump standing there for all of the awkwardness looks presidential. Good day for Trump.STIREWALT: Yes.BREAM: If you're making points with Bill Kristol, the Trump camp's doing something right.  STIREWALT: Probably didn't sway the vote but definitely Donald Trump took a chance and it paid off and that's what he was looking for. Look. We had been expecting that this race would hold the same trajectory from now until Election Day and that the only thing that changes would be Hillary Clinton get indicted or the Russians hacking something or faking something to try to blow the race up. Donald Trump took the race into his own hands today.  He went down to Mexico, he took a chance and he got away with it.He got away with it and he is coming back to the United States now in a position now that his supporters can say, look, we don't -- I think this is the most important part with Donald Trump and his core voters. They don't believe him. They believe in him. They don't believe what he says. They believe in him as a person. Him as a movement. Him as an idea. Him as a leader. So, he has a lot more latitude than normal politicians do because his followers, that core group of believes will do whatever he says, they will walk through fire for him. Because they think he's just the right guy.  BREAM: All right. Quickly, he laid out five different things today that he thought were important in this relationship with Mexico and his ideas on immigration. Do you think we'll basically hear more of those maybe fleshed out tonight? Do you think you want to get anything out of left field or do you think we know what he's going to say?STIREWALT: Well, his campaign isn't working very hard to manage expectations for this speech tonight. He has got a lot of clean-up work to do on his immigration policy. Because remember, he is moving back towards the immigration policy that he used to beat the stuffing out of his fellow Republicans for holding. So, basically, he is working his way to Mitt Romney's self-deportation which is strong border security, tough internal enforcement and over time illegal immigrants who don't want to become part of the system are going to have to leave and go home on their own.He's working towards the same position that in part his nominee had in 2012 but he's just got to do it with a little more flourish because his supporters, of course, this is his reason. There would be no Donald Trump if it was not for the wall that he once said he would build across the Southern U.S. border. There would be no Donald Trump if he had not mocked and laughed at other Republican politicians who said anything other than mass deportation. So this is a tough -- this is a tough pivot.  BREAM: Uh-hm. All right. Chris Stirewalt, we'll see you again a little bit later. Thank you very much.  STIREWALT: You bet.  BREAM: All right. As Carl mentioned, one of the defining characteristic of Donald Trump's immigration policy and as Chris said as well is the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. He has been repeatedly defiant though about who's going to pay for it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(AUDIENCE CHANTING)Build that wall! Build that wall!TRUMP: We're going to build that wall. Don't worry about it. We're going to build that wall. We're going to build the wall and who's going to pay for that wall? Who? Oh, they think we're kidding, too, don't they, folks?  Yes. We are not kidding. We're not kidding.We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall. That will be for a later date.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Which may be why almost as soon as Trump's meeting with Mexico's president had ended, media outlets started quoting him saying, ""At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.""Joining me now, David Wohl, attorney and Donald Trump supporter. And Jose Antonio Vargas, an illegal immigrant and founder of ""Define America.""  Great to see you both.JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS, FOUNDER, ""DEFINE AMERICA"": Hi, Shannon. Thank you for having me.BREAM: Okay. So, it sounds like a further clarification possibly from the Trump camp saying, you know, if the President mentioned it off the top and then Mr. Trump didn't respond, then there was technically no discussion of it. Jose, does that fit? Can they both be right about what was said or not said?VARGAS: Well, I mean, I have to say, listening to all these rhetoric that's been happening in the past few hours now after the meeting. I mean, is this a reality television show? Like, is him being presidential going to Mexico and actually not offending somebody, isn't that just being human?  Like, why is that all of a sudden just, quote-unquote, ""being presidential""?BREAM: Well, you know, Jose, his critics has said, he couldn't do it, that he can't stay to message, that he can't be disciplined, that he can't avoid taking the bait.  VARGAS: You know, but again, I have to say --(CROSSTALK)Well, I just have to say, as someone who's directly impacted by this issue as an undocumented immigrant myself, he's about to speak in Arizona which is home to about 300,000 undocumented immigrants, many of whom have relatives who are U.S. citizens, either naturalized or U.S. born. This is not just about undocumented people, these about our families who are U.S. citizens who are hearing all this rhetoric, who have heard everything he said in the past year and a half as he's called us criminals and illegals as if we're insects off people's back. You can't just take that back. You can't just unsay that. Right?BREAM: Well, David, let me bring you in here because I thought it was very interesting that everything that Mr. Trump laid out today with Mexico's president was very much addressing both countries saying, there are problems that we both are suffering. We're both being hurt by the illegal flow of illegal cash, weapons, drugs going both ways on the border and it sounded like he was trying to make a very conciliatory tone. Our country needs each other. We need to help each other.  DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY: Well, the post-meeting press conference between Mr. Trump and Mr. Pena Nieto was nothing short of extraordinary. I mean, they looked like two leaders of state, frankly at the U.N. And what Mr. Trump did today was leapfrog over Hillary Clinton when it comes to conduct becoming of a president. And you're absolutely right. They touched on issues amazingly that they agreed on. The right to sovereign protection by a wall. The right to stop human trafficking and drug trafficking.The right to amend NAFTA to benefit both countries. One of the most amazing thing that Mr. Trump talked about was keeping wealth and keeping industry within our hemisphere. So not just in America. But within America and Mexico to benefit both countries and not allowing it to go overseas to China, for example. This conciliatory tone, this tone of wanting to help Mexico be better because a better Mexico benefits America was just amazing. It was unbelievable.  BREAM: Okay. All right. Gentlemen, I'll ask you both to stand by. We're going to dip into former New York City Mayor and Trump advisor and a supporter Rudy Giuliani. Let's listen to what he had to say ahead of Mr. Trump's speech.  RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Second generation. Third generation. The tremendous contribution they have made to the United States and how much he loves them. He also made it clear that illegal immigration hurts both countries.(APPLAUSE)Donald Trump will secure our borders and Hillary Clinton will not. It's as simple as that. Donald Trump will build a wall. She'll open our borders even more. Look at the situation with the Syrian refugees. This is really very hard to understand. It's really hard to understand that we have all these refugees from Syria, all of that caused by the fact that President Obama and Hillary Clinton have totally ruined the Middle East. Hillary Clinton is running on her experience as secretary of state. Based on her experience as secretary of state, I wouldn't hire her as the dogcatcher in New York City.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Not only that, based on how she handled top secret information, she wouldn't pass an FBI background check for a government position! And they want to make her president. Can you imagine that? I wouldn't let her near an FBI office or a U.S. attorney's office. Anyplace sensitive. I wouldn't put sensitive information in her hands because as the director of the FBI says, she was extremely careless.(CROWD BOOING)Hillary --BREAM: Rudy Giuliani, head of Donald Trump's speech in Arizona on immigration. Jose, he talked there about refugees coming into this country and immigrants coming into this country and about the fact that there is an element of danger. There are those who have admitted they will use the process to, you know, hide bad actors among people who are good, innocent people coming here. You must acknowledge that there is something to be said for cleaning up our immigration system and securing the borders.VARGAS: Well, absolutely there's something to be said that we need an actual modern system so that we know who's here. There is just a report on Mother Jones, by the way, that said that apparently there's undocumented models who worked for Donald Trump under the Trump model management.  Right? We should know if people here are illegally or overstay their visa.  So, we know what the system looks like. I absolutely agree with that. Now mind you, like, are we hearing Mexicans actually blowing things up here in this country coming from the Southern border?BREAM: But it is not even just the fact that we're thinking of Mexicans are terrorists.WOHL: No.  BREAM: You have to think about the fact that both leaders today admitted there are people who come from other countries through Mexico to get into the U.S. They said other countries aside from Mexico, people who are clearly bad actors to think they can blend in and get across the border.  WOHL: Shannon, they've been caught at the border and he also, you know, Donald Trump did today was he went out of his way to acknowledge the amazing contributions of Mexican-Americans. I mean, I work with some unbelievably talented lawyers. I appear in some great judges of Mexican- American descent. There are so many that contributes, so much to our economy. But he just says, look, they benefit, too, if we just enforce the border and make sure that people that come across the border are good guys and not bad guys. It is really that simple and he is going to vet them and that may be the process of the 11 million undocumented in the country. It may be a hyper vetting process. We will have to wait and see but, you know, it's going to be something fair and humane.  BREAM: We'll see as we await to get some details and hopefully he'll outline things in more detail tonight. David and Jose, we thank you both for your expertise and viewpoints.  VARGAS: Thank you, Shannon.BREAM: Thank you.All right. Again, this wildly anticipated Trump speech on immigration is expected any minute now. It's supposed to offer us more details on his plan to overhaul immigration, a plan Trump's team now insist is unchanged since its inception. As a reminder, let's go back to July 2015 and here is how he was defining this issue during a border visit at the start of his race.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think it's a great danger to be here for you?TRUMP: Well, they say it is a great danger but I have to do it. I love the country. There's nothing more important than what I'm doing. And I'm the one that brought up the problem of illegal immigration. And it's a big problem. It's a huge problem. You folks know it better than anybody. And you look at the crowds outside. We have big crowds, they're all screaming in favor of Trump. Everybody wants. Because they want the problem fixed.  It's been an amazing experience. Mexico is booming. Absolutely booming.  And Jesus the city manager and Pete has done an amazing job right here.  But a lot of what's happening here is because of the fact that Mexico is doing so well. Just doing beyond, beyond what anybody ever thought. And I don't know if that's good for the United States but it's good for Mexico.  I think I'll win the Hispanic vote. You know, I have thousands of Mexicans and Hispanics. Over the years, thousands and thousands of Hispanics have worked for me and now work for me and the relationship is very good.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You keep saying that there's a danger but the crime rate along the border is down. What danger are you talking about?TRUMP: There's great danger with the illegals and we are discussing that.  But we have a tremendous danger on the border with the illegals coming in.  Yes, ma'am?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you seen any evidence here to confirm your fears about Mexico sending the criminals across the border?TRUMP: Yes, I have and I've heard it. And I've heard it from a lot of different people. And in fact, as you know the border patrol was the one that invited me. I think most of you have that invitation, we sent it.  The border patrol invited me and then they canceled because, frankly, they don't want to get involved. They know that the reason they invited me was because of the tremendous problem and the tremendous crime and all of the things that you're talking about. So they invited me and then at the last moment, I mean, we were virtually in the air and they said, we can't involve. And I heard they got those orders from Washington.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What evidence specifically have you seen?TRUMP: We'll be showing you the evidence.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When? How?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you say to the people who I've spoken to this morning in Laredo who called you a racist?TRUMP: Well, you know, I have, I just landed and there were a lot of people at the airport and they were all waving American flags and they were all in favor of Trump and what I'm doing. And I mean, virtually everyone that we saw, that was such a great, warm -- I was actually surprised. But there was such great warmth at the airport with all of those people that were there and so, we're very, very honored. Yes, go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There were plenty chanting against you.TRUMP: No. They're chanting for me.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. They were chanting against you.TRUMP: I didn't see them.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Many feel that what you said when you said that the people that cross the border, rapists and murderers --TRUMP: No, no, no. We're talking illegal immigration. And everybody understands it. And you know what? That's a typical case. Wait. That's a typical case of the press with misinterpretation. They take a half a sentence.(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)They take a half a sentence. By the way, they take a half a sentence and they take a quarter of a sentence and put it altogether. So typical thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: That press conference got a little wild. All right. While Trump's team insists tonight that little has changed since those remarks over a year ago, chief Washington correspondent James Rosen did some digging and here's a look at what he found.  JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good evening. The danger for Donald Trump in shifting positions on illegal immigration is not simply that he has ridden this issue so hard in this cycle, but that it threatens to undermine his broader reputation as a non- politician who shoots from the hip without fear of political repercussions.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TRUMP: When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.  They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some I assume are good people.  ROSEN (voice-over): From the day, Donald Trump launched his once improbable bid for the Republican nomination, illegal immigration has beamed his signature issue. He promised to build a wall along the southern border.  TRUMP: They built the Great Wall of China. That's been 13,000 miles.  Here we actually needed 1,000 because we have natural barriers.  ROSEN: And to make Mexico pay for it. He promised to revive the mass deportations of the Eisenhower era.TRUMP: He is going to have a deportation force. And you're going to do it humanely.  ROSEN: And not to approach the existing population of illegal immigrants here with half measures.  TRUMP: We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back, some, will come back.  The best. Through a process. They have to come back legally.ROSEN: The proposal for the wall has stayed and Trump now the GOP nominee still promises to deport the criminal elements but he appears to have backed off his pledge to deport all 11 million.  TRUMP: And there certainly can be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people. We want people. We have some great people in this country.  We have some great, great people in this country.  ROSEN: As part of that softening, Trump's talk of a deportation force has yielded to proposals rather similar to those put forward by the rival GOP candidates he once derided as weak on immigration including the use of e- verification and stops undocumented workers can take to remain here.TRUMP: They'll pay back taxes. They have to pay taxes. There's no amnesty as such. There's no amnesty. Right.  TRUMP: But we work with them.  ROSEN: Most vocal in the alarm over Trump's shifts had been supporters on the right. Many of whom waited their adult lives to hear a GOP nominee speak like Trump has on immigration but two prominent players agree there's been no shift.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People will need to leave the country to be able to obtain legal status or obtain citizenship. And that's going to be very consistent with what he said throughout the course of this campaign.  People have been coming out already on his team and saying, no, we are still going to have a deportation force. Don't worry about that. So, we'll see what he says.  (END VIDEOTAPE)ROSEN: If Trump's shifts on immigration are driven by his low poll numbers among Hispanics as his critics charge, then he is headed in the right direction. The FOX News poll conducted this week finds 77 percent of registered voters supporting a system for illegal immigrants working here to become legal residents with only 19 percent favoring deportation of as many illegal aliens as possible -- Shannon.BREAM: All right. James Rosen in Washington. Thank you. And joining me now, Trump supporter and former presidential candidate himself, Dr. Ben Carson. Doctor, great to see you tonight.  ROSEN: You, too, Shannon.  BREAM: All right. You know there was some people out there, Donald Trump has got an uphill battle when it comes to this particular issue. First of all, he has got to convince those who think he is too much of a hard liner that he is mediating his position enough that he cares about people as human beings, he is compassionate but keep the other end of folks who liked him so much in the primaries because he was hard on immigration. How does he do that?DR. BEN CARSON, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think people recognize that he's different than the politicians of the past. You know, both Democrats and Republicans have promised that they were going to secure the borders. Has it been secured? Of course not. He will secure it.  There's no question about it. And also, he will make sure that the laws are enforced. There are multiple immigration laws on the books that have not been enforced. We don't even know what the country looks like when you enforce the rules because we haven't done it. Always trying to curry favor and curry votes.So, that will be a very different situation and it will result in a different population. Also, he wants to get rid of the sanctuary cities and get rid of the criminal element. When you do all of those kinds of things the people who are left can be looked at again. You can be thinking about guest workers. There are a number of opportunities to look at this in a fair and compassionate way.  BREAM: Doctor, you talk about things like changing policy on sanctuary cities which by the way they continue to get millions and millions of dollars in funding from the federal government even though they are refusing to comply as you know with federal law. That would take some cooperation from Congress. Do you think a President Trump is prepared to get down to the nitty-gritty and sit there and work some of these issues out with Congress so that the immigration system can be streamlined, can be made better for everybody involved?CARSON: Absolutely. And I don't think that he would hesitate to call out members of Congress who refuse to cooperate, who refuse to put the interest of the American people on the front burner. And that's going to cause a lot of people to rethink their position.  BREAM: All right. And by the way, we just want to note that the number two on the ticket, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, who's the GOP's VP pick at this point is now taking the stage. And we assume we are just minutes away from Donald Trump. Until then, Dr. Carson, we'd like to ask you a few more questions. I have a statement here from a Clinton campaign today talking about, obviously, poo-pooing the idea of Mr. Trump going to Mexico and I'm giving the speech tonight.Clinton's spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri saying in part that Trump is committed to splitting up families and deporting millions of people. How does he deal with that accusation when part of his policy is going to involve some of those things? Unless he's making a massive change tonight.CARSON: Right. He continues to talk about the real issues and the real solutions. Of course, the Clinton people are going to disparage anything he says or anything he does. I would completely ignore that. That's foolishness. And I think a lot of the American people are starting to recognize that. What they want to hear is a comparison, a direct comparison of Donald Trump policies and Hillary Clinton's policies.One is going to secure our borders, put Americans first and try to be fair and equitable and the other one is just going to open the borders to whoever wants to come in and an attempt to curry favor and to curry votes.  And I think it's pretty obvious. And I think the American people are actually a lot smarter than anybody gives them credit for and I think they can see right through this.  BREAM: All right. Dr. Ben Carson, it is always a treat to see you. Thank you so much.  CARSON: You, too. Thank you, Shannon.  BREAM: All right. We are standing by because we understand just minutes away from the speech that Donald Trump has been talking about all day. His team has been talking about it. We're going to hear from him on his details about immigration. It is something that we have been watching and waiting for. As we try to figure out exactly what his positions are. It seems there's been some softening or evolution recently. And in the meantime, we have been left to speculate on exactly where he stands on some of these things.By the way, brand new FOX News poll show the White House race is tighter than it has been in weeks. Hillary Clinton's lead over Donald Trump is narrowing down from 10 percentage points in early August to six points tonight.Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast Bureau with more on what is happening in this tightening race. Hi, Trace.  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Shannon. In the 25 years that Americans have come to know Hillary Clinton, their opinions of her have never been lower. According to the new Washington Post""/ABC News poll, 56 percent of Americans now have an unfavorable impression of Clinton and just 41 percent view her favorably. Even more troubling for the Clinton campaign is that her numbers are dropping with groups that have been very supportive.Among women, her favorables were down from 54 percent to 45 percent. Among Hispanics, she is down from 71 percent to 55 percent. And among liberals, her favorables have dropped from 76 percent to 63 percent. Hillary Clinton would be the most unpopular presidential nominee in modern history if not for Donald Trump. Only 35 percent view him favorably. Sixty three percent unfavorably. But Trump's popularity is relatively steady while Clinton has declined and trust appears to be a major factor.A FOX News poll asked why Clinton set up of private e-mail server, 52 percent said for convenience. But 44 percent say, she was trying to hide things. And when asked the likelihood, the Clintons were selling influence to those who donated to the Clinton Foundation, 66 percent say it's very or somewhat likely versus only 30 percent who now say it's not likely. And the other shoe may be yet to drop.Among the 15,000 e-mails recovered by the FBI during its investigation into Clinton's private server, 30 may be related to the Benghazi attack which sparked the e-mail investigation in the first place. The Clinton camp maintains that, quote, ""Some if not all of the e-mails are duplicates of ones Mrs. Clinton turned over to the State Department."" The State Department will only say they are still reviewing those e-mails -- Shannon.  BREAM: All right. Trace Gallagher on the brand new numbers, thank you so much.All right, we are going to bring in Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor as we think we're just minutes away now from Donald Trump taking the stage. Chris, those are some interesting polling numbers. There are some positives there for both candidates but there are plenty of negatives, too. As we said all along, these two are the most unliked -- two primary candidates left for the general election probably that we have ever seen.STIREWALT: I heard cross tabs being talked about and I just perked up in here. Yes, 100 percent, these are unhappy voters broadly speaking because we get closer to the end, it's Labor Day, they got to choose.BREAM: All right. Chris, I'm sorry. I got to stop you because it looks like Donald Trump, the GOP nominee for president, is now taking the stage in Arizona for the much anticipated immigration. We will now listen and pick up details, see if we get anything new tonight.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
