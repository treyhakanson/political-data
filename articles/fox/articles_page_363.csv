This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Should U.N. ambassador Rice resign? Now, earlier, former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld went ""On the Record.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)VAN SUSTEREN: Mr. Secretary, nice to see you, sir.DONALD RUMSFELD, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY: Thank you. Good to be with you.VAN SUSTEREN: There are many calls by Republicans for secretary -- or for ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice to resign. She has the backup of the secretary of state and the president, but there are calls for her to resign after going on all those talk shows and pushing this YouTube video as the reason, the cause. Your thoughts, sir?RUMSFELD: Well, that's really up to the president and the ambassador, as far as I'm concerned. I think that the president can nominate who he wants. And the Senate confirmed her. And she's the ambassador while she's there.I watched the presentation, and I thought it was amazing that someone in her position would go on with that degree of certainty, that fast and that authoritatively and be that wrong.VAN SUSTEREN: Do you think she was perhaps hung out to dry? Because I thought it was unusual that the ambassador of the U.N. would be making that appearance right after that event. I would have expected some other member of the administration, not the ambassador to the U.N.RUMSFELD: I agree. It would have been more likely that someone from the cabinet or the White House staff or the NSC staff might have said something. It may very well be that she was already scheduled and they just used her. But her -- her presentation was demonstrated to be inaccurate within a matter of hours, which has got to be embarrassing.VAN SUSTEREN: What about the investigation? We are confirming this morning, one of my colleagues, Justin Fishel over at the Pentagon, producer, that the FBI 20 days later still has not set foot in Benghazi.RUMSFELD: I would guess the FBI is trying. And my guess is that he -- the individual who makes the decision has decided that the situation's still not safe for that team of people to go in. Obviously, every day that goes by means that the -- the scene will have been sufficiently disturbed that the likelihood of their learning much diminishes with every passing day. VAN SUSTEREN: How could it not be safe for our FBI, who are pretty well trained for security, and yet it was safe for our ambassador and others to be there?RUMSFELD:  It wasn't safe for our ambassador.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, no, but I mean, the thinking -- I mean, when -- obviously, it wasn't because they were killed. But I mean, the thinking -- the thinking that the FBI are not tough enough and armed enough and ready to go and investigate that because, as you say, as time marches on, we lose evidence, we lose information.RUMSFELD: Sure. I think that once an event like that happens and the people are killed, it's clear that they misjudged the security situation. They didn't have the kind of security that they needed to stay alive. And my guess is that it's very difficult for the FBI to figure out exactly what the security situation would be.If they go in, it would be noted. They would be a target. And it may very well be that the government is encouraging them not to. It could be that they just have concluded that they would make such a presence if they went in that they could become a sizable target.But I just don't know. I think it's unfortunate that they've not been able to get into the crime scene.VAN SUSTEREN: You know, I've always been on the outside. And it's very different on the outside than the inside. But I'm curious if you have any sort of thought why the administration went out with the YouTube video theory to begin with because on the outside, it's 9/11, it's Americans in a hostile environment and on our territory, a consulate in Libya, yet they went out with the YouTube and they stuck with it for so many days. And you know, even without the ability of intelligence, I would have at least couched it a little bit differently.RUMSFELD: Well, you're quite right. They made a terrible mistake. I think what they did was -- you know, hope springs eternal. They wanted it to be the YouTube, and they -- it was much more convenient from the administration's standpoint to have it be the film that nobody's seen.And yet it demonstrated such serious misjudgments on their part, to think that they could make it be the YouTube, which it wasn't, obviously, as time's gone by. And I quite agree with you that anyone looking at it, knowing the history of September 11, would at least have registered that that could very well have been part of an organized attack, which apparently, now people in the senior in the administration have acknowledged, that it was a planned attack.VAN SUSTEREN: Is there a consequence of that misjudgment, or is it something we all chatter about it amongst ourselves, like, How could you think it was a YouTube video when it's obviously something different? Is it -- is there a real consequence to that mistake, or misjudgment, as you call it?RUMSFELD:  Well, I think so. I think -- and you know, anyone can make a mistake. So you can have one incident where it's happened, something happens. But they've had a pattern where the leaks out of the White House and the presentations by the White House have been the kind of thing that, in retrospect, looking at them all as a pattern, they're calculated to try to make the president look like he's in charge and that he is not being -- that his foreign policy is working, instead of the fact that it seems to be unraveling as we watch the world scene.We see that country after country -- I don't know how many it's been, 15 or 20, where the people have been burning American flags, have been burning pictures of the president of the United States, have been attacking embassies in one way or another, demonstrating an opposition to the United States and to the policies that this president has put forward. And that's got to be disturbing.You're in the middle of a political campaign, so it makes the administration look bad. And my impression is that they're trying to spin things in a way that will mute the difficulties we face in the world, and they're serious difficulties.VAN SUSTEREN: How do you describe his foreign policy?RUMSFELD: I think that the foreign policy of this administration for three-and-a-half, four years now has been one of a step back -- the phrase that came out of the White House, to lead from behind, which you can't lead from behind. Leaders lead from the front.The economic management of our country has told the world that we're in decline, and it was sufficient that the vice president of the United States had to go at his convention and say, We're not in decline. Now, why did he have to say that? Because it's clear the country is managing its economic affairs in a way that tells the world we're modeling America after Europe. And that's a failed model.The idea of another half a trillion-dollar cut in the defense budget sends the signal out to the world that the United States will not be in a position to contribute to peace and stability and contribute to a better world, which we've done throughout my adult life. We've -- we've -- our country has been a factor, a presence, but it's in withdrawal under this administration.And I -- a vacuum abhors a -- it just -- it'll be -- it'll be filled -- it'll be filled by somebody, and it'll filled by countries that don't have our best interests at heart.VAN SUSTEREN: If someone from the administration were here, the response would be, Well, he inherited two wars and a deep recession. Now, the debt -- the debt has gotten much larger. I mean, there's no question about that.RUMSFELD: Oh! There's the understatement of the year!(LAUGHTER) VAN SUSTEREN: So but how do you respond to -- like, you know, what should he have done differently, or how would you have -- you know, and I realize there's some value, 20/20 hindsight, but I also know that you have some -- your own thoughts, even if this were back three-and-a-half years ago.RUMSFELD: Well, I mean, just to give you one example, when you demonstrate weakness as a country, people take advantage of that. The phrase ""weakness is provocative"" is real. It encourages people to do things they wouldn't otherwise think of.And so this pattern of apology by this president, the pattern of not even getting a status of forces agreement in Iraq, where we would have had an arrangement with that country, the setting of a timetable in Afghanistan, it seems to me, all are examples of a withdrawal, a decline, a pullback by our country.And I think that that's unfortunate because I think that the -- that vacuum's being filled, and it's being filled by people who don't have our interests at heart.VAN SUSTEREN:  You mentioned Iraq. I read just moments before coming in here that September was our deadliest month, the deadliest month in Iraq in 12 years.RUMSFELD: There were -- the fact that a number of additional troops were put in Afghanistan led to additional targets in Afghanistan. And there, too, we've seen a good many attacks against our forces.VAN SUSTEREN: We hit our -- we hit our 2,000 milepost over the weekend in Afghanistan. RUMSFELD: Exactly.VAN SUSTEREN: That doesn't count the people who came back and were severely injured and may have died from their injuries.RUMSFELD: Exactly.VAN SUSTEREN: So your assessment of the war now, both wars?RUMSFELD: I think that each country is considerably better off by not having the Taliban in Afghanistan and not having the ""Butcher of Baghdad,"" Saddam Hussein, in Iraq. The countries have been given an opportunity to have a freer political system and a freer economic system. They've fashioned their own constitutions.They are going to have to -- those countries are going to have to plan their future and figure out their future and make their future. We can't build nations for other countries, the United States. But we can be helpful. And if we do it in a wise way, we can set them on a path that will be better for their people and better for the region and better for the United States. That does not mean we have to stay there forever, in my view.VAN SUSTEREN: This administration -- I was in Afghanistan, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a group of women that the United States would not leave and let the Taliban come and continue to do the things to the women that they're going to do, that they did historically. It looks like the Taliban is coming in full force.RUMSFELD: I don't know that.VAN SUSTEREN: You don't think they're coming in at full force, the Taliban? RUMSFELD: Full force? I wouldn't...VAN SUSTEREN: I mean, you don't see...RUMSFELD: ... use the phrase.VAN SUSTEREN: ... the -- I mean, I guess the -- that there's a strong presence of the Taliban right now.RUMSFELD: There's no question the Taliban was shoved out of that country, and a Karzai government was elected and a new constitution. It's also no question but that they've been reorganizing in Pakistan and they've been attempting to reassert themselves within the country. How far they'll get, I don't know.I think that the -- the people of Afghanistan were relieved when the Taliban was gone. Now, is it intimidating? Do they kill people? You bet. They were using the soccer stadiums to cut off heads. Women couldn't go out without a male member of their family. Women couldn't get health care in that country.But a lot of refugees who left the country have come back. I think the people of Afghanistan like the fact that they had an election and voted for their parliament. And I think they have a crack at building a better country.VAN SUSTEREN: Are you optimistic? RUMSFELD: Oh, I'm realistic, I think. I think it's up to them. They're going to have to pull up their socks and grab it and make it work, and they're going to have to make it work in a way that won't be exactly the way we made it work. But it's a tough path for them, no question about it.VAN SUSTEREN: Egypt -- and now that President Morsi is in command -- your thoughts. Is this better for the United States? How does this -- how does Israel -- is this better for Israel? Israel should be nervous or uncertain, or is this worse?RUMSFELD: Oh, I think it's worse for Israel, without question. I mean, Sadat, Anwar Sadat, and Mubarak fashioned a relationship with Israel that created a stable situation there and put Israel in a much more secure circumstance.Morsi is Muslim Brotherhood. He -- the Salafists in the parliament, with the Muslim Brotherhood, have control. The stabilizing influence in that country, in my view, is the military. And how that will shake out over time -- but I personally -- I don't think we're better off there. I think you can't be better off with a Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt, in my view.Furthermore, I think you can't be better off if the impression in that part of the world is that we've turned away from the liberals, we've turned away from the people that were supporters of freer political system and freer economic system. And -- and I guess the secretary of state, when she was over there, was -- had tomatoes thrown at the United States secretary of state. And it wasn't by Muslim Brotherhood people. I'm told it was by people who feel that we've left them. We've left them in the lurch.And the other problem you have with what happened to Mubarak is other countries around the world see that and they see that the White House in the United States, as they say, threw him under the bus, cut him loose, said he should go. Every leader in that part of the world wonders, are they next? Are they going to be told by the White House that they should go and shift support away from them?Our country went through a long, tough process. We went through a horrible civil war. We had slaves into the 1800s. Women didn't vote into the 19 -- we didn't arrive like this.And those countries are going to be perfect. They're going to be imperfect, if perfect is what we think of ourselves. We're still evolving, and they're going to evolve. They're going to be different than we are.And for us to be as judgmental to think that we're going to be better off with the Muslim Brotherhood than we are with the Sadat or Mubarak governments, or that Israel's going to be better off, I think is missing the point. I just don't believe that's true.VAN SUSTEREN:  One last question. Next four years with a President Romney and foreign policy and next four years with a President Obama foreign policy. What's the -- what do you foresee as the difference and where are they similar?RUMSFELD: Oh, I think the difference will be significant. Normally, the Republican and the Democratic Party have really within been within the 40-yard lines, to use a seasonal figure of speech. But I think in this case of this president, we're not. We're -- we're -- he's -- he's way, way over in terms of the policy.Governor Romney without doubt understands that our country is exceptional. He recognizes the role we've played in the world. He believes that the world is a better place if we are a participant in that world and recognizes that it is not for us to go around the world apologizing and wringing our hands.What's called the Arab spring is really something that's happening in the Islamic world. It's not Arab only because it's happening in a good many other countries, as you know well. And it's not spring, but it's summer and fall and it's going to be winter. It is a significant shift on the part of a lot of people in a lot of countries, who are encouraged and see the rise of Islamist non-secular forces in those countries. And that is not in our interests.VAN SUSTEREN: Mr. Secretary, always nice to see you, sir.RUMSFELD: Thank you.(END VIDEOTAPE)"

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Health care reform may just be the new third rail in American politics. Now, brand-new polls are showing that the president's push for government-run health care may be responsible for the end of Obama-mania.Now today's Rasmussen daily presidential tracking poll shows that the Anointed One's disapproval rating is now higher than his approval rating. And on health care, an overwhelming majority of those polled say that not passing health care reform this year would be better than passing the Democrats' plan.Joining us to help us sort through all of this, columnist -- you see him often on National Review Online, and he will be filling in for the great Rush Limbaugh tomorrow.MARK STEYN, COLUMNIST: Yes.* Video: Watch Sean's interviewHANNITY: Now, for people who don't know, that microphone is really gold.STEYN: That is a real golden...HANNITY: Golden microphone.STEYN: As you well know, Sean.HANNITY: Yes, my first five minutes filling in for him once, the microphone fell to the ground. I'm like, ""Oh, no, my career is over.""STEYN: That's not good. I'll try not to do that.HANNITY: Well, good luck. You've been filling in. You do a great job.Let's talk a little bit about these polls. The president's approval rating, every reputable poll shows he's losing ground and health care is losing ground. What's your analysis?STEYN: Well, his -- his personal rating is coming down to meet the unpopularity of his policies. Basically it's only a few weeks since Newsweek was telling us that he's a kind of god who bestrides the world like a colossus.HANNITY: Right.STEYN: And the more he's connected up with these policies the more he's just another 50-50 president like his supposedly discredited predecessor. And I think that's because most people, a lot of people believed that he really was this post-partisan, centrist, pragmatic, fiscally conservative figure that he campaigned as.And as you and a few others pointed out, he's not. He's -- the extreme left-wing is where he's lived all his life, and he has a transformative domestic political agenda that people don't want.HANNITY: What do you make of what was going on? We discussed this with Dick Morris. His floating this trial balloon about eliminating the public option, which I argue is still going to be government-run. They're still going to control costs, and they're still going to ration. What do you make of what they did?STEYN: Yes, I agree with you. I think this is kind of a fame. What he needs to do is pass something. He needs to get across the river and burn the bridge because once you do, it won't be possible to go back.So what he has to do is create the conditions for embryo government health care, because that's the fastest way to a permanent left of center political culture. That's true in Canada, and that's true in Europe. To guarantee a permanent left of center political culture, you need to get some form of governmentalization of health care through.HANNITY: This is their holy grail of the left.STEYN: Yes.HANNITY: I mean, they have put a lot of political capital in this.STEYN: Right, right.HANNITY: The American people don't want it by a pretty large margin.STEYN: Exactly.HANNITY: And so are they going to try to force it down America's throat?STEYN: They've had to back off, but I think they will kind of force it down. You know, Sarah Palin got a lot of shtick for this -- death panel. But that's absolutely what it means.The -- health authority in British Columbia has just announced that it's cutting back on senior services to eliminate its budget deficit, and it's going to cut elective surgeries by 15 percent. What that means is that you can elect to have the surgery, but the government won't elect to give it to you.HANNITY: Yes.STEYN: That's what government health care, government bureaucrats inserting themselves between you and your doctor, that's where all this is.HANNITY: Let me just hold up to our audience at home. A poll, 57 percent don't see the stimulus working. This was on the front page of USA Today in today's edition. Look, the government can't run ""cash for clunkers.""STEYN: No. No.HANNITY: Bank -- Medicare is bankrupt, and Social Security is bankrupt. Why is there any American which has any confidence that they can run the health care industry?STEYN: The little bit they do, this H1N1 flu vaccine they were supposed to have whatever it was, 120 million shots ready by the fall. But now they said it's only going to be 40 million. That is what -- think of anything you like. Would you want it run by the government?Would you like to go on vacation to a government-run hotel? No, you wouldn't. They have those in the Eastern block. Nobody wants government running anything that's important to them.HANNITY: But look at the -- look at the latest. Not only 57 percent don't think the stimulus is working here. We've got home prices declining. These are the latest headlines as it relates to the economy. Retail sales are down. Revenue to the government is down.Last week we announced that the government in one year has quadrupled the deficit.STEYN: Right.HANNITY: Foreclosures are up. The cost of the government day went to August 12 this year...STEYN: Right, right.HANNITY: ... which is nearly 2/3 of the year we work for the government. And they want to buy G-5s for politicians.STEYN: Which is disgusting, by the way, and that's really what's driving a lot of the anger out there. Is people like Arlen Specter and Nancy Pelosi, they're our representatives. They're not our rulers, and they've forgotten that. And that's -- that's what's driving a lot of this anger.But you're right: this is all completely wasted. And that's why his approval rating has fallen, because people are saying, no matter how cool he is, if your home is falling in value, if your job is in jeopardy, if your health care is in jeopardy, what good is it to have a super-cool president? It's not enough.HANNITY: What do you make of -- we just had Katy Abram on the program. What do you make of the attacks against American citizens, and the names -- the mobsters, the Tim McVeighs, the Nazis? What do you -- why would the Democrats do that? What strategically and tactically is the benefit?STEYN: I think they have to. They do it very effectively with individuals. They did it with Joe the plumber. They did it with Sarah Palin. Now, whether it's talking complete nonsense is if you think back a couple years to the anti-globalization summits -- I went to the summit of Americas -- all these people come in, these youthful activists, so-called come in. They trash the town. They throw bricks through McDonald's. They smash the street windows.And everybody says, ""Oh, well, they're just -- that's just the idealism, left-wing idealism."" Didn't matter how much you trash and destroy in the name of left-wing idealism.HANNITY: Is this the Alinsky model? You know, isolate, polarize?STEYN: I think it is. I think they can't afford -- these are ordinary citizens. And what's interesting is they're not even Republican or right-wing, a lot of them. A lot of them are just seniors who are concerned about what's going to happen to Medicare. Yes, they're not agents of dark forces. They're ordinary citizens, confronting representatives who have forgotten that they are citizen legislators and not the Gulf Stream rulers.HANNITY: We forget the term ""public servant,"" Mark. They're supposed to be public servants. All right. Here's my final question for you. Look, they may be repositioning where they are. I don't believe they've given up their ultimate goal, which is the elimination of the employee benefit system, a single payer system. Obama is on record as even saying he wants.Where does this end up? Do they now go back to the drawing board, come up with new talking points? Do they go through incrementalism? What do you think?STEYN: No. They want an embryo plan that contains within it the seeds for a government health care system.HANNITY: The co-ops. But is a co-op any different than the so-called public option?STEYN: No, I don't think so. Because in the end if you have a government perspective on health care, it leads to rationing. The thing about a death panel isn't that it's a panel that actually says, ""We're denying you this treatment,"" it's that the whole system is, in fact, a kind of death panel, because it has to make judgments about letting Mr. Smith live and Mr. Jones live. It's the nationalization of your body. They have the -- the government says we have the right to decide whether you can have your hip replaced.HANNITY: They have the right to decide that. They ration care. They dictate the price. They dictate the supply, and they run competition out of the market.STEYN: That's right. That's right. It's happened everywhere.HANNITY: All right. Will you be in for Rush tomorrow?STEYN: Yes.HANNITY: All right. We'll be listening. Mark, good to see you. Thank you.STEYN: Always a pleasure, Sean.-- Watch ""Hannity"" weeknights at 9 p.m. ET!Content and Programming Copyright 2009 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Gary Sinise is one Hollywood celebrity who has managed to steer clear of the city's liberal politics. In fact, he devotes a lot of energy supporting our brave men and women overseas.And he sat down with me earlier to discuss his latest effort to support the troops and one special soldier in particular. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: First of all, I'm a great admirer of yours. Not just your great acting skill. You're somebody I've gotten to know over the years that has a love of our military.You put time, money, effort, energy, you travel, you meet the troops, you play for them. Why don't you tell us a little bit about your background and how you got involved in all of this?GARY SINISE, ACTOR: Well, I have military in my family on both my wife's side and my side. My wife has -- her two brothers served in Vietnam War. Her sister was a captain in the Army. Her sister married a Vietnam veteran who was in the Army for 24 years.And then I have, you know, veterans on my side. My two uncles were in World War II. My dad was in the Navy so it's kind of around me and I've been involved with Vietnam veterans' groups for many, many years. I got involved with the disable Americans veterans after I played Lieutenant Dan in ""Forest Gump"" and have stayed very, very active with the disabled American veterans ever since the early '90s.And then, you know we got hit on September 11th, I felt like I just needed to jump in and try to do something to help. Now, we have a lot of injured service members, many, many thousands have been wounded in the war. We have many, too many gold star families.And it just feels like it continues on. It's not something that's going to end any time soon, it didn't seem. These families need our help and I'm just trying to pitch in and do my part.HANNITY: You work on number of different charities. You see the troops a lot. A mutual friend of ours LeeAnn Tweeden that brought my attention in your efforts involving a Lt. Dan Band event that you're doing in building homes for heroes and it's happening on the 21st of August, and people can get tickets in Staten Island, New York.This is an incredible story about Brendan Marrocco. Maybe you would be better off telling the story than I would be and explain this is the first quadruple amputee to ever survive. He's got an amazing story and you're trying help him out. Why don't you tell us about him?SINISE: Brendan was injured in April of 2009. You know, a little over a year ago in Iraq in a bombing. He lost both his arms and both his legs. LeAnn was actually on a trip to Iraq at the time that he was injured, delivering school supplies for my program Operation International Children.We send school supplies for the troops along with American Airlines LeAnn was over there on this particular trip, I couldn't be there, but she went in my place and they were delivering school supplies and they found out that Brendan had been injured on their way back.They were in Germany and they saw him in the hospital about two days after he was injured and then about a month later, I saw him at Walter Reed and have stayed in touch a little bit. I was in an event called -- a wounded warrior event Hope for the Warriors, where they presented him with an award.Now through Building Homes for Heroes and the Stephen Siller Foundation, we're going to try to build him a especially designed house. Now, there are a lot of severely wounded soldiers out, but Brendan, of course, is -- has special means because he lost both arms and both legs.He's from Staten Island. I offered up my band. I have a band that plays a lot of the troops, the Lt. Dan Band. So we're going to play a concert for Building Homes for Heroes to raise money to build him a home on August 27th at that concert there at the St. Georgia's Theater in Staten Island.HANNITY: We're putting up on our screen so people can come see your band and contribute to this great cause, which I'm going to join in with as well. This is a really special case. It has had an enormous impact on his family too.He had a brother that I understand that worked for Citibank, quit his job, went down to Walter Reed. He's now on his third, I guess set of new legs they are working on. They're doing amazing work the doctors and the medical team down there. Tell us a little about the special homes that you're building for these guys.SINISE: Well, Building Homes for Heroes is one of several organizations actually. There are a bunch of different organizations out there that have just popped up, because people felt a need to do something and help.We have a lot of severely wounded folks out there and go to the Building Homes for Heroes website, and you can see some of the folks that they've been helping and this next project is to build this especially-designed home in Staten Island to help Brendan.Obviously, he is going to live the rest of his life impaired having lost both arms and both legs. So whatever we can do with this particular home to make it easily accessible and to make it easier for him to live and to raise the quality of life, that's what we're going to do.So I just volunteered my band to help raise some money for this. Frank Siller is involved with the Stephen Siller Foundation. They've teamed up with Building Homes for Heroes. Great, great folks there, they're all pitching in.
