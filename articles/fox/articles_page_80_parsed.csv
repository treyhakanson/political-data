 White House's Hardball Politics 
"	By itself, the White House's campaign to blunt the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's opposition to health care reform by persuading member companies to break with the organization is hardball politics, but as the saying goes: Politics ain't beanbag.But is that all there is to it? Remember what happened when Humana, the health insurance company, warned policy holders that health care reform could threaten their coverage under Medicare Advantage. In fact, under the Senate bill, it could. But the administration promptly ordered the company to stop sending such messages, an order that has since quietly been lifted.Then came the insurance industry study that said the Senate Finance Committee bill could lead to much higher premiums. The committee had weakened the requirement that everyone obtain health insurance. That left open the likelihood that healthy people would not buy insurance, and pay the modest fine, knowing that if they got sick they could buy it later and could not be refused it under the new bill.The president himself had made the same point, but he immediately denounced the industry for doing a hatchet job and has been attacking the industry ever since.Then, of course, there's the current White House war on Fox News, the kind of anti-media campaign not seen since the days of Richard Nixon.Anybody see a pattern here?-- Brit Hume is the senior political analyst for Fox News Channel.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It i s my job as the president of the United States to make sure that a process is followed that examines all the options, looks at all the consequences before a decision is made. Now that process is moving forward, the State Department is making sure that it crosses all its t's and dots all its i's befo re making a final determination.SEN. JOHN THUNE, R - S.D.: So all this rhetoric and all the hot air that comes from people here in Washington, D.C. about wanting to create jobs, this is really putting it to the test. This is where you have to put up or shut up when it comes to whether or not you are serious about creating jobs in this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHANNON BREAM, ANCHOR: Of course, talking about the Keystone XL pipeline that would bring fuel from Canada through the U.S. down into the Gulf coast region. A lot of folks thinking it would create a lot of jobs, but the president is not going to make a decision until after 2013, some point in 2013. So let's talk about it with our panel. Charles, Nina, and Charles. Charles K., I'll start with you. What do you make of this? Of course it puts the president between two difficult constituencies and today in an odd position with the Canadian prime minister.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: And the Canadian prime minister was extremely soft spoken. He spoke like a friend. He didn't in any way criticize the president. But that is because Canadians are nice. I know that, I grew up in Canada, extremely nice. The Mounties, the beavers, the maple leaves, the loonies. But the Canadians are not stupid. The foreign minister who was here today said that if you have a store, you want to have a lot of customers, meaning that if the United States is not going to accept a gift, a secure source of oil from a friendly ally and a -- really a strategic asset, which will incidentally create a lot of jobs, if it doesn't want the Alberta shale oil, they will build a pipeline west and China will have access to it.And I think they are serious about that. They are deeply upset about what was purely a political decision on the part of Obama. This idea that he had to do a process and to dot the i's and cross t's is rubbish. The pipeline was the most studied pipeline in the history of American pipelines. A three-year study by the State Department which found in two very large reports no serious damage or danger of it. And yet Obama overrode that. Why? Simply because he didn't want to anger his base. And so he punted it into 2013. And I can assure you that the Canadians are not happy about that. And we could in the end forfeit a huge source of jobs, energy, security, and a really important strategic asset as a result.BREAM: And something the president said today is that he warned Republicans and those on Capitol Hill who would try to tie forcing the Keystone XL pipeline to the extension of the payroll tax cut. He will veto anything that comes along the lines. It was pretty tough language.NINA EASTON, COLUMNIST, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: And I just want to follow up on Charles' point about Canadians being polite. I was at the APEC, Asian Pacific Economic Ministers Conference in Hawaii just a month ago and Prime Minister Harper was not so polite. He met with Chinese President Hu Jintao and made it clear to Obama that, guess what, we are going to take that oil to the Asian markets. And he's made that very clear.That's a real -- I think that's a really smart issue for Republicans to latch on to. And I think it's smart to tie it to the payroll tax. Because, what you've got -- you are giving up the potential of 20,000 blue collar jobs, for what I call the one percent jobs. So we are going to spend another year after we've already said that it will have no environmental significant impact on the environment, so you spend another year paying white collar workers to do more environmental analysis, more legal stuff at the expense of these 20,000 blue collar jobs which we need right now.BREAM: And as for the threat from the president, we got a response to from House Speaker John Boehner's office through his spokesman Michael Steel saying ""We are working on a bill to stop a tax hike, protect Social Security, reform unemployment insurance, and create jobs. If President Obama threatens to veto it over a provision that creates American jobs, that is a fight we're ready to have."" Charles, how do you see that fight playing out?CHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL WRITER, WASHINGTON POST: Well, I kind of agree with Nina that the Republicans have sort of found a way to kind of counter the advantage that the president was building on the payroll tax, namely, tying it to this Keystone pipeline which we had a poll showing it's a popular -- broadly popular among those who have heard of it.I guess the president is in this unenviable political situation where he's caught between the labor and the environment. But just to echo something that Charles said, the person who is getting hit in that is Canada. And honestly this is the second issue on which the president has cross swords with our friendly neighbors to the north. The other one being the Buy American provisions in the stimulus. Everyone's forgotten about that but all of that really annoyed Canada because they were going to sell things to the U.S. under the free trade agreement. So, I mean, we talked about Israel at the beginning, but, believe it or not, we have opened a little bit of a breach in our relations with Canada in the last few years.EASTON: I want to add that when Obama was candidate and he said we need to relook at NAFTA, that didn't go over well in Canada as well.BREAM: How awkward do you think that meeting was behind closed doors?KRAUTHAMMER: Well, knowing how polite Canadians are, it probably wasn't awkward. But I think Obama knows exactly what he's done, and I think that Chuck is right. Obama has a talent for alienating and injuring friends, allies, Canada, Israel, the British, and appeasing enemies. And I think it's a pattern that Republicans ought to seize, explain, and run on.BREAM: Alright panel, thank you very much. That is it for the panel, but stay tuned for a never before seen political ad.Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2011 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

 Las Vegas Reality Politics 
"	"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:Bipartisan IdeasIn last night's press conference, President Bush vowed to listen to ideas from either side of the aisle on the issue of Social Security reform. But The Washington Times reports that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told Democrats not to attend a bipartisan meeting with Republicans and the AARP
   (search) on the issue this week, insisting that ""one thing we have to have on Social Security is a united front.""A spokesman for the Republican congressional committee charged that Pelosi is playing politics with social security. And Ed Case of Hawaii, a Democrat who broke ranks to attend the meeting, says that while some in party are against it, ""I think talking is worthwhile.""Time for a ChangeAfter a bitter debate, Indiana lawmakers decided to reverse 33 years of state history, passing a bill to observe daylight-saving time. The debate over the time change began in 1949, when the state's rural lawmakers claimed that switching clocks was ""unhealthy for the cows."" Indiana was declared exempt from daylight savings in 1972. But Republican Governor Mitch Daniels has pushed for the time change in Indiana, hoping being in sync with other states will boost the state economy. The landmark measure passed late last night, after failing earlier in the day by just one vote. Republican lawmakers called the vote an ""emotional,"" one.Reality StarThe mayor of Las Vegas is about to join the reality TV universe. Oscar Goodman has chosen from among five proposals to star in his own reality program showcasing his day-to-day life governing the famous city. Goodman, who created a stir when he told a group of fourth graders that the one thing he'd want to have on a desert island was a bottle of gin, says he picked this particular deal because it allowed him more control over the show's content and promised, ""I'm not going to let anything embarrassing to the city on the air.""Pitching the Pope's WheelsNow that the bulletproof pope-mobile will transport Benedict XVI from point A to point B, he'll have little use for his old car, so one of his German countrymen is auctioning it off on eBay. The metallic gray 1999 Volkswagen Golf, which comes complete with a registration in the name of ""Joseph Kardinal Ratzinger,"" received 300 bids in the first day and a half, with the bidding topping out at more than $1.3 million dollars. EBay determined that most of the bids were fraudulent, however, and brought the price down to a more reasonable $54,000. The seller says that at that price, the car is a steal -- he claims it ""rides like heaven.""-- FOX News' Michael Levine contributed to this report"	['Pelosi']	[]
