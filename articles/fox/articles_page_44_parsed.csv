This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: This is a Fox News alert. There may be another Ebola patient in the U.S. The University of Kansas hospital says an individual has come to its facility in Kansas City with a high fever and other serious symptoms. The patient reportedly had recently worked on a medical boat off the west coast of Africa, the epicenter of the outbreak. That patient has been isolated, we are told, and is undergoing tests. The facility's chief medical officer says the patient is at a low to moderate risk of Ebola and that many other diseases fit the patient's symptoms. However, he was in that area, obviously. Meanwhile, as we told you earlier there has been a confirmed case of Ebola transmission within the U.S. involving a 26-year-old nurse who gave care to the Liberian man who brought Ebola with him to Dallas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. TOM FRIEDEN, CDC DIRECTOR: Yesterday, we confirmed the first case of Ebola contracted in the United States in a health care worker who cared for who we refer to as the index patient in Dallas, Texas. Our thoughts are with this health care worker. She is now being cared for and we understand that she is clinically stable.We have to rethink the way we address Ebola infection control because even a single infection is unacceptable.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: More breaking news. The Associated Press is reporting is had been given records indicating about 70 hospital staffers were involved in the care of Thomas Eric Duncan who died of Ebola last week. Steve?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: You have to be concerned about the dramatic change in tone that you are hearing from Dr. Frieden there. Last week, from Dr. Frieden and some others, the tone was one of reassurance. They wanted to avoid a panic. And I think it is understandable that they want to do that. It is a delicate balance to do that but also warn people.But last week, we were getting these reassurances and we were hearing repeatedly about how hard it was to catch Ebola. Today he is talking about having to rethink our entire approach to Ebola. That's a pretty big change. And my concern is that all of the efforts that we had initially to try this or talk down the threat, to try to avoid inciting some kind of a national panic are now going to have the effect of doing exactly that as people realize that the things that they are saying today are vastly different from the things that they said before, and, importantly, if we see more of these cases that the reassurances that we got on the front end were not accurate.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, I think we are going to rethink and it's going to be done quickly. Number one, the idea, we are going to have to start evacuating patients. The idea that we are going to treat a patient at a local hospital whenever the disease pops up is insane. You can't train that many people across the country, and 99 percent of that training will be wasted because it is only going to happen in rare places.You want to evacuate the patients to the regional centers -- in Emory University, the NIH, there were a couple of others -- where they are trained and they can handle this. Yes, it means that you take the patient away from the family. Nonetheless, this is a public health emergency.Second, we are going to have to have a travel ban. If this patient who arrived off Liberia or off the west coast is indeed Ebola or if and when the next patient happens, there is no reason why we should be flying -- Air France, British Air have canceled. The reason given is it would stop aid going into West Africa. That's nonsense. You allow anybody who is a real aid worker to apply. State Department will look at your credentials, answer questionnaires. We'll send you over and then track you on your way back until you arrive here plus three weeks. That's not a hard problem to get around. But these things are going to have to be done and they're gotta be done soon.CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, WASHINGTON POST: You know one of the worst parts of all this is it is happening in the middle of the last month of an election campaign. And as you guys have been reporting, there is plenty of demagoguery to go around on this. And that only I think, unfortunately, is kind of fuelling people's sense that they don't know who to rely on for information about this, because in addition to the signals they're getting from Dr. Frieden from the CDC who is an expert, they are also getting a lot of 30 second ads accusing the Republicans of causing it or accusing Mark Pryor of causing it, or this, that, and the other thing. And the whole environment now is really in need of some competent, authoritative figure that people can rely on. And unfortunately, we don't seem to have somebody like that.BAIER: We will continue to follow all of this and all the details, breaking news here on Fox News Channel. That's it for the panel, but stay tuned for some lessons learned from North Korea.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, just 48 hours before the final presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses take place, and six days before those votes are cast, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump now says he will skip the Fox News Google debate.Welcome, to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. The news breaking just a short time ago during a press conference in Iowa where our own Carl Cameron was standing by. And he spoke directly to team Trump afterwards.  We'll go to Carl in a moment. But first, this controversy dates back to August 6th, and the very first Republican debate co-moderated by yours truly. Mr. Trump took issue with this question that I posed to him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter. However, that is not without its downsides, in particular when it comes to women. You have called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.  Your twitter account --DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Only Rosie O'Donnell.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: No, it wasn't. Your twitter account --(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Thank you.KELLY: For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.TRUMP: Yes, I'm sure it was.KELLY: Your twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks. You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice, it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president? And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton who was likely to be the democratic nominee that you are part of the war on women?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In the months since, Mr. Trump has repeatedly brought up that exchange as evidence of alleged bias on my part. I maintain it was a tough but fair question and we agreed to disagree. This past weekend, Mr. Trump resumed his complaints about yours truly arguing that Fox News chief Roger Ailes should ban me from the debate this Thursday. Fox News had announced back in August that Bret Baier, Chris Wallace and I would be the moderators of this next debate. Mr. Trump's complaints continued through the week, ultimately resulting in a video today he posted to Instagram, hitting this issue again.Fox News responded and we'll get to all of that in a moment. As the front- runner, he was scheduled to be front and center on Thursday night when Fox News hosts the Republican debate in Iowa. Now he says he will not show.  We have a powerful political lineup to discuss the debate and the Iowa caucuses now just six days away, including our Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Tony Perkins is here to break news on ""The Kelly File"" tonight with his presidential endorsement, which the top front-runners were both seeking. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani also joins us, along with, and this is the first for ""The Kelly File,"" filmmaker Michael Moore, the only time that we have ever seen him and one of only a couple of times ever for Mr. Moore on this channel.But we begin tonight in Des Moines, with our chief political correspondent Carl Cameron and the news on Mr. Trump. Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Megyn. It is unprecedented for a front running candidate in either party to suggest they will be a no-show at a debate four days before the first of the nation's caucuses, is something that no one could have imagined prior to Donald Trump's candidacy. He held a news conference today in Marshalltown, Iowa before a rally, and Mr. Trump gathered the press just a few feet away from where the rally audience was waiting, and he initially suggested that he might not appear in the debate. But first, let's listen to what he said to the news conference initially.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Most likely I won't be doing the debate. See, the point is that with me, they're dealing with somebody that is a little bit different.  They can't toy with me like they toy with everybody else. So let them have their debate and let's see how they do with the ratings.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAMERON: So it sounded like he was pretty clear that he wasn't going to go but it wasn't a sealed deal. And within just a matter of moments, Mr. Trump's senior staff, his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and his Communications Director Hope Hicks both told me that the boss, in their words, had made the decision and it was final, he will not be participating in the Fox debate two nights from now. And they have spread it out throughout the rest of the press. I suppose it's possible he could change his mind, leaving it to the staffers to say that it was a definitive no and he wouldn't be showing up. Because what Mr. Trump said, well, is that he was still probably not going to come. But he's been issuing statements so he will be on twitter and Facebook soon, probably further pushing himself further away from Thursday night's festivities -- Megyn.KELLY: Carl, what does this mean for the other candidates?CAMERON: Well, it means that there is the potential for an empty podium and an opportunity for them to debate without facing Trump's insults. And for Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio in particular, that presents a big opportunity. Mr. Cruz is essentially in a virtually tied race against Trump at the top of the polls here in Iowa, and Cruz has been in quite a fight with Donald Trump and today he has issued a challenge to debate Mr. Trump head-to-head without moderators, and begun to criticize Trump for being afraid to show up. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think anyone running for president of the United States owes it to the people of Iowa to have the humility to come in front of you, to make the case to answer the hard questions, to look you in the eyes. This is a job interview. The President of the United States works for each and every one of you.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAMERON: There will be a lot more commentary from the rest of the field that's not Donald Trump on Thursday night and as Ted Cruz has just shown, there will probably a lot of allegations that Trump didn't have the guts to show up -- Megyn.KELLY: And just to remove the doubt at least for now, Mr. Trump came out with his campaign statement just moments ago and says that he will not be attending. I'm trying to get the exact quote up here. He will not be participating in the Fox News debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for veterans and Wounded Warriors, et cetera.Carl, thank you. So, how did we arrive here? Earlier today, Donald Trump posted this video.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Megyn Kelly is really biased against me. She knows that, I know that, everybody knows that. Do you really think she could be fair at a debate?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: He also posted a twitter poll asking his followers if he should even participate in the debate. He had already been told by Fox News that I would. Fox News later today released this tongue in cheek statement that read, quote, ""We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they met with him if he becomes president. A nefarious source tells us that Trump has its own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings.""Further, Fox News Chief, our chairman, our chief executive Roger Ailes said, quote, ""Megyn Kelly is an excellent journalist and the entire network stands behind her. She will absolutely be on the debate stage on Thursday night."" And just now he announced he will not.Brit Hume is our Fox News senior political analyst. Brit, your thoughts?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think this is partly about you, that's pretty clear. He's never gotten -- Trump's never gotten over that first question you asked him, which like, you know, to me at least, and I think to any other reasonable journalist was a completely fair and relevant question. But he never seems to been able to get passed that.  And I think it's partly about the news cycle. Certainly he this -- this is all anybody is talking about tonight. The twitter verse lit up a bit like you wouldn't believe and I'm sure you know. And I think it's also been partly about the fact that he may feel now Megyn that he's gotten -- he's caught up and pass Ted Cruz, who was leading him in Iowa, and that he can afford now to skip this debate and not give Cruz a chance to take him on in a way that might be risky to Trump.Trump might well believe that he could win such an exchange. But I think he may feel that he's in a position where it's not worth taking the chance.  It will be very interesting to see how he responds to the Cruz challenge to a one on one debate, because Cruz will be campaigning on that now for the next several days, accusing Trump of being unwilling, you know, to face the voters. Remember this, Megyn, in 1980, Ronald Reagan was going into that primary season, on the Republican side, the presumptive front-runner, but he skipped Iowa.And the voters of Iowa were not amused, and George H.W. Bush won the Iowa caucuses. He worked hard to do it. There was a debate in Iowa, Reagan skipped that. Reagan recovered quite nicely in New Hampshire soon thereafter, but it was an interesting moment. Voters in Iowa, I think, take the caucuses seriously. They expect the candidates to face them. And while Trump has certainly campaigned in Iowa, it will be interesting to see how people respond to his refusal to participate in the debate which is clearly an Iowa debate. I mean, that's the purpose of having it when it was scheduled.KELLY: Uh-hm.HUME: So that will be interesting to see.KELLY: I mean, what's interesting here is Trump is not used to not controlling things as the chief executive of a large organization. But the truth is, he doesn't get to control the media. And while he's made his position clear about me, after that first debate, Roger Ailes made his position clear, too. And you know, when Trump started it up again this past Saturday and resumed it again and again and again and again, he was told repeatedly, our debate team is settled and then came that Instagram video he put out today followed by the company statements.HUME: Well, Megyn, news organizations need to the greatest extent possible events like this and then their coverage generally to be neutral in their approach. So, if a news organization sets the terms of the debate, makes them public, sets forth who will be doing the questioning, people can either accept or not accept. Trump appears has decided he would not accept. He's free to do that. What he's not free to do and what no news organization would allow would be for him to, in some way dictate the terms of the debate. And I don't know why he thought it was possible to do that.  Remember, he had an earlier debate, he was demanding some controversy -- the CNN debate, I think he would be demanding some donations be made and so forth, they weren't and he showed up anyway. It looks to me like this time he's so far out on the loom of not showing up, that he won't show up.KELLY: You know, the company released it in August that the same debate team that hosted the first debate would host this debate. And then there was an official press release in early December. Nothing's changed. But as we got closer to it, and as we are a week away from Iowa, his tune changed. And he resumed the rally to try to change the debate team as settled by this company.HUME: Make no mistake about it, Megyn, this act by Trump will not hurt him a bit among his hard core followers. As far as they're concerned, now he could take off all his clothes and run down Broadway tomorrow and they would say, look, yes, that's great, he shows he's not politically correct.  So, this won't move the needle with them at all. My only question would be, whether this is a smart move with regard to the voters in Iowa, who may, serious people that they are, be looking at this and expecting to see him in the debate and perhaps those who were undecided, and there's some number of those, were hoping to get a better sense of him and of the other candidates, and if he doesn't show up, I don't know how well this is going to go down with them. It's impossible to say.KELLY: Brit, it's great to see you.HUME: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: I'll be there. Bret is already there. I think Wallace is coming today. I'm not sure. But look, the debate will go on with or without Mr. Trump.There is a Trump rally about to begin, as any news happens there. We will bring it to you.Plus, there is more big news breaking on the Republican race. Tonight, as Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, a man whose endorsement has been sought, in particular by the two front-runners in Iowa, joins us in a ""Kelly File"" exclusive to announce who he will endorse just 48 hours ahead of the big debate.And then Rudy Giuliani is here to talk about why he is backing Donald Trump in the showdown with Senator Ted Cruz.And then controversial never shy, filmmaker Michael Moore comes to Fox News and to ""The Kelly File"" to talk about the 2016 race. Don't miss this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Members of Congress, this is Michael Moore. I would like to read to you the USA patriot act.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: So, why is it that I'm leading Ted Cruz with the evangelicals and why is it that here I'm leading him and I'm leading him big nationwide?  Because he's really a nasty person. People don't like him. Senators don't like him. The people he works with don't like him. You have to have, you know, we can all be rebels. I'm a little bit of a rebel. But you have to be able to get along with people. And when you say, why am I doing better with the evangelicals than Ted Cruz? Because they like me better than Ted Cruz.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was Donald Trump in Iowa just a few hours ago touting his credentials among evangelical Christians, after receiving an endorsement from Liberty University President and Evangelical Leader Jerry Falwell, Jr.  But Senator Ted Cruz is presenting Mr. Trump with some stiff competition.  As a new Quinnipiac poll suggests, Mr. Cruz is actually winning among white evangelical voters. You can see the numbers, 39 for Cruz. Twenty seven with Trump in Iowa. Tonight, with just 48 hours to go until the debate, comes an endorsement that could be critical to this Republican nomination.Joining me now in a KELLY FILE exclusive, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council and author of ""No Fear: Real Story of a Courageous New Generation Standing for Truth.""Tony, good to see you. So, they all wanted you. You are an influential man in conservative circles in particular with the evangelicals. So, who are you endorsing?TONY PERKINS, PRESIDENT, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL: Well, Megyn, as I promised, I would let your viewers know first. And let me just stay upfront, this is a personal endorsement, not from any of the nonprofit organizations that I lead. After looking at these candidates, talking with them, and I have many friends in this race. But I believe the one who has best positioned, best prepared to lead this nation forward pulling it out of the tailspin that this president has put us in, I believe is Ted Cruz.  He is a -- he's smart. He's bold. Much like you, he's not afraid to upset people to do the right thing. He's not worried about making everybody happy.And I think if you're making everybody happy, you're not doing the right thing. And I've known Ted, I've supported Ted, I've worked closely with him in the Senate. And, you know, Megyn, this is not about his -- this is about his standing on conservative principles, it's about his standing on the constitution, standing in the polls or standing with his colleagues.  That's why I support him. He's a bold leader, he's the kind of leader we need right now in America.KELLY: Why not Trump? Because I know he had courted you, as well. And many evangelicals really love him. I mean, it's -- just because you're evangelical doesn't mean you go with the most conservative candidate necessarily.PERKINS: Well, look, I mean, evangelicals are pretty complex. We're not single focus -- single issue voters. There's 90 million evangelicals in this country. And Donald Trump, there are things about him that are attractive. I actually find him interesting. I would consider him, at least we've laid a foundation for a friendship. I'm not going to say anything negative about Donald Trump. I want to talk about who I think is right now has the --KELLY: What I'm trying to get at is what did it for you? Like, what was it about Cruz?PERKINS: Well, because I know him, I worked with him. I have watched him in the Senate. I've seen him stand up against his colleagues, I've seen him take the criticism, and he's simply doing what he said he was going to do when he ran for office.KELLY: But you heard what Donald Trump said, he can't get along with anybody, nobody likes him.PERKINS: Look, if everybody gets along with you in this city, you're in trouble. That means you're not doing anything worthwhile. Look, all I can say is, he has done exactly what he said he was going to do, when he ran for the United States Senate. I supported him when he was an underdog against actually some other friends. One of the guys he ran against end up working for me. All good guys. But I believe he was the right guy for the right time to come to the Senate and shake things up. And I believe he's the right guy to lead this country forward. I trust Ted to do what needs to be done to make our families safe again, to give our country a reputation that has standing among the nations. I believe he is the right guy.KELLY: But let me ask you this before I have to go. Donald Trump says he can get deals done, and that he has a proven history of it. He says Ted Cruz cannot because he's been an alienating force in the Senate. Your thoughts?PERKINS: Leadership is not all about making deals. Leadership is about standing on principle, about respecting the constitution. No one understands the constitution like Ted Cruz. He's argued before the Supreme Court nine times. He's written 60 briefs for the Supreme Court. The next president will nominate two to three Supreme Court justices.KELLY: Uh-hm.PERKINS: I believe Ted will be the best one to select a conservative or a constitutionalist for the court. I'm concerned about where some of the other candidates would come from when it comes to the court, which, as you know, Megyn, is very unfortunately, very important in the direction of this country.KELLY: And people forget to talk about it. You know, in the campaign season. But the court is huge, and Ted Cruz, yes, he clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist which is, imagine that, like clerking for the chief justice and then returning to appoint justices as the U.S. president.  Pretty cool for him. Tony, great to see you.PERKINS: Thank you, Megyn. Good to be with you tonight. And I'll see you in Iowa. I'll be there.KELLY: Oh, good. I'll be there, too. Well, Tony Perkins just told us why he's backing Ted Cruz.Up next, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani tells us why he's backing Donald Trump over the Texas senator.Plus, in a KELLY FILE exclusive. Controversial filmmaker Michael Moore on the 2016 race. President Obama's legacy. And his thoughts on this week's GOP debate.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUDY GIULIANI, R-FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: I think these two votes in Iowa and New Hampshire are going to be much more important than usual. And not necessarily because they're going to pick the winner but they're going to tell us something about Donald Trump. They're going to tell us is that tremendous sentiment which he has, and there's no question that he does, the biggest crowds, the numbers on the polls, do they convert to votes without necessarily having the ground game that some of these other guys have? If they do, then he is a very serious candidate and possibly --(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And that was former New York City mayor and former Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, one of several establishment Republicans. There he is, warming up to Donald Trump. As the Republican race resembles more and more like -- it looks more and more like a showdown between the two frontrunners, Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Mayor Giuliani telling The Washington Post that if it came down to Trump or Cruz, there is no question, I would vote for Trump.Joining me now with his take on the race, Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Mayor, it's great to see you.GIULIANI: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Why? What did it for you?GIULIANI: OK. First, the difference between the two of them, Donald is a more practical guy. I have to tell you, he's a personal friend. Four of the candidates are personal friends. Not including Ted Cruz. I love them all, hard to pick. I don't know who I'm going to endorse.KELLY: Uh-hm.GIULIANI: But between Trump and Cruz, Cruz is too rigid, he's too right wing. He will give away the northeast, gone.KELLY: In the general?GIULIANI: Absolutely.KELLY: OK.GIULIANI: Maryland, up to Maine, gone. California up to Washington, Oregon, gone.KELLY: Uh-hm. Who can Trump get that Cruz can't get in the general?GIULIANI: I'll give you one person I just had dinner with the head of the correction workers union in New York, Norman Seabrook who is an African- American, enormously well respected by everyone in the African-American community. He said to me tonight, I'm endorsing Donald Trump, because he can get jobs. Donald Trump can do what Ronald Reagan did. He can reach over and he get Reagan Democrats.KELLY: Uh-hm.GIULIANI: He can also get African-Americans, believe it or not, Latinos, because he's knocked hard by the long connection with the Republican Party that we all have. Blacks have this feeling about the Republican Party that we're anti-black, anti-Hispanic. We're not. But they have that feeling.  He doesn't carry that burden with him.KELLY: Uh-hm.GIULIANI: He could reach over and he could be an enormously powerful general election candidate.KELLY: Why do you say you think he'll get Latinos? Because if you look at the, you know, polling of his numbers --GIULIANI: Yes. You know, because --KELLY: -- on Latinos, it's like 80 percent opposed?GIULIANI: You know what he's right about?KELLY: When he finally gets to him, what they really care about, jobs, can they work, can they lift the economy? Can they create growth? Can he reach out to them the way Ronald Reagan was able to reach out to the union workers, who were all Democrats but they voted for him because they felt he could increase their wages. Now, I believe he's making a mistake in not showing up in the debate.KELLY: You do?GIULIANI: He should be in that debate.KELLY: Why?GIULIANI: First of all, I think he's going to do really well. His debating performances as you watched them, from the debate you had through getting better and better. His answer to Cruz on that statement Cruz made about New York --KELLY: Uh-hm.GIULIANI: I thought was close to eloquent. I mean, it lifted to him to like presidential levels. So if I were Donald, and I'm not, right, and he makes up his own mind, I would participate in the debate. Because I think he'll win it, and I don't know why he's not doing it.KELLY: What do you make about the, you know, if there are tough questions in a presidential contest. As I would say, you guys will run for this office --  GIULIANI: You've got to deal with it.KELLY: You don't want George Washington check out.GIULIANI: Yes. I was the front-runner for not as long as he was but I've been the front-runner for a long time. Every debate I went into, I prepared for and I knew I was going to get asked the trick questions, the tough questions. The go get you questions. Chris Matthews once asked me what's the difference between Shia and Sunni. George Stephanopoulos --KELLY: You gave him a long lesson.GIULIANI: I did. I gave him a lesson.KELLY: Never test your knowledge on anything.GIULIANI: I went back to the 6th Century.(LAUGHTER)George Stephanopoulos asked me of all the things I did wrong in my life, including my marriages, what do I feel worst about. I said to George, I would rather confess that to your father, a priest, than to you.(LAUGHTER)But you have got to be ready for that.KELLY: Uh-hm.GIULIANI: If you're the front-runner, they're all coming after you. Right now, Donald is the front-runner. And I love Chris Christie. Jeb Bush I consider a close, personal friend. I was the second person to endorse Rubio when he ran for senator and he was 27 points behind.KELLY: Wow!GIULIANI: He would make a great president. And Donald's been my friend for 25 years. This is very tough for me. Because every one of these people are close friends. But you know the guy that comes out of this that I respect most? Your boss --KELLY: Amen.GIULIANI: Roger Ailes. He was my first political consultant. He taught me how to stop being a lawyer and become a politician. And that man is a genius and he's a man who understands loyalty.KELLY: That's exactly right. And he has his employee's backs.GIULIANI: And I love him.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: It's usual. I think what we really learned here tonight is that Mr. Mayor Rudy Giuliani is going to have a cabinet position in the next administration.(LAUGHTER)Great to see you, sir. A pleasure.GIULIANI: I didn't get in one thing, you did not ask him an unfair thing.KELLY: Oh, thank you. That's very nice. I appreciate that. We did not plan that.GIULIANI: I would have answered that question.KELLY: Thank you very much.Well, coming up, Governor Chris Christie is here. He's going to join us tonight on the breaking news about the Fox News debate.And then a new poll reveals that many voters in Iowa still have not made up their minds. Former presidential speechwriter Marc Thiessen and Fox News contributor Guy Benson are next on what that means.  Plus, for the first time in more than five years, controversial filmmaker Michael Moore comes into the lion's den. Fox News channel and ""The Kelly File"" to talk about the 2016 race. Don't miss this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Home to the rarest of mythical creatures.

We don't have.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nothing?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nothing.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was a clip from the new documentary ""Where to Invade Next,"" from controversial filmmaker and political activist, Michael Moore. In the film, Moore travels through Europe to highlight what he believes to be America's shortfalls and he has been making provocative stuff like this for decades.In 1989, he burst into the scene with ""Roger and Me,"" a documentary about corporate greed. In 2003, he won an Oscar for ""Bowling for Columbine,"" an attack on America's love for guns.Now Mr. Moore is back in the headlines, leading protests over a water crisis in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. The city is now under a federal state of emergency after toxic lead levels were discovered in the drinking water.Here now in a Kelly File exclusive, Michael Moore. Great to see you. Thank you for coming here.MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER & POLITICAL ACTIVIST: Well, thank you for having me, and on this day, too. I don't know, what does this feel like for you, too? Because you don't want to be the story, you're the journalist.KELLY: I think somebody -- I get to ask the questions here. You have to answer them.MOORE: No, I feel bad for you. You know, there you being cat fight, don't know.KELLY: Don't feel that way.MOORE: I know what's he afraid of? I'm sitting here, I don't feel any fear, right?KELLY: I'm not a pussy cat.MOORE: Yes. Donald, come now, come sit beside me.KELLY: Stop that.MOORE: I'll hold your hands.KELLY: Stop it.MOORE: She's fine.KELLY: Stop that. Let's talk about the movie.MOORE: Oh, sorry. No, and we don't -- plugging the movie, it's not why I'm here.KELLY: Where do we invade next? Is it in Iowa?MOORE: I'm on Fox News. No, but there are people there.KELLY: All right. Well, let's talk about the movie in a second. But first, I want to talk a little politics here.MOORE: Sure, sure, yes.KELLY: So, I'm figuring you for a Bern, baby, Bern, kind of guy. Am I right?MOORE: Well, you know, I think I endorse him in his very first congressionalist. I went up to Burlington and did a rally for him.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Were you like too.MOORE: No, because that's all nice of you. You can't be sure. You're not feeling bad right now. You're like...KELLY: I'm feeling very good. Yes, why?MOORE: OK. Because I was thinking I was going to be like, hey, maybe I'll take you out to dinner afterwards.KELLY: Would you stop! Would you talk about...MOORE: And you know, we can talk, you know, you can emote.KELLY: Emote.MOORE: You know, get it out. You know why I'm here for you. That's just what I'm saying.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: I know he didn't decide to you.MOORE: You didn't deserve -- you just didn't deserve to be treated this way.KELLY: I'm fine.MOORE: OK. But in all seriousness, let me say this thing partly to answer your question and not to answer it. You have done something that Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rubio, Cruz, none of them have been able to do, which is to essentially brain him, make him run, shut him down.KELLY: Which can we move on from the Trump situation?MOORE: But you haven't done -- you know, everybody has tried to do this for months and you did it.KELLY: All right.MOORE: And we're on -- OK, I'm sorry. I have to behave myself.KELLY: This is why O'Reilly never had him back.MOORE: No. He didn't have me back because I won the debate. But that's OK. Bill, any time I'm here.KELLY: All right. So, this is why I ask you about Hillary versus Bernie. Because I went back...MOORE: Yes, yes.KELLY: ... and to be perfectly honest, I don't know that much about you. I've seen it -- I've heard of a couple of your movies.MOORE: Yes, I'm an eagle scout.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But this is...MOORE: I went to the seminary to be a priest...KELLY: ... this is April 2008 and you are trying to batter me up with the eagle scout.MOORE: No, I'm just -- I mean, because you don't know anything about me. I'm going to tell you.KELLY: But you didn't like Hillary Rodham Clinton back in 2008, saying that the way she was running you found disgusting, and really found Barack Obama to be the more decent person. Now, seven and a half years later, how do you feel? How do you -- about both of them?MOORE: Well, first of all, I actually, I like Hillary, and back in the '90s, my first book I had a chapter in the book called ""My Forbidden Love for Hillary."" And basically I made the case for why she's a good person and she's been treated wrong.KELLY: Then why were you calling her disgusting?MOORE: Well, I think some of the things she said one of the debates about Obama just I thought were a little low.KELLY: Yes, that's a fair way low.MOORE: Yes, that's true. You should not go out to dinner with me.KELLY: Don't worry.MOORE: No, no. It's a bad idea.KELLY: I won't. So, what about Barack Obama? Because you -- he was beloved. I mean, you really thought he was the messenger.MOORE: Yes. Yes. And I voted for him. I voted for him twice.KELLY: He's the guy who's going to change the country.MOORE: Yes.KELLY: Hope and change, going to bring us together.MOORE: Yes.KELLY: And then you said, you know what, years into it, he's only going to be remembered for being the first black president.MOORE: Yes. Well, I wrote to him and I said, you know, you've got to get off the dime here and do some of the things we elected you to do, because it's not going to be enough in the history books to say the big claim to fame is that you were the first African-American president.That's an important thing, but we need you to do some other things for us and we need you to do it before your term ends.KELLY: What, Why? What's the biggest disappointment in your view?MOORE: Well, I don't know. Disappointment is probably too strong of a word. I would have wish that we had a single payer health care system, not ObamaCare, something that would be, you know, for everybody.KELLY: He couldn't get that through.MOORE: Well, he had two years actually where he had the House and the Senate, and he decided to play nice and get along and he thought the republicans were going to get along with him and they had no intention of doing that.KELLY: All right. What else?MOORE: Guantanamo Bay should be closed by now.KELLY: He tried.MOORE: He's tried to do that. That's what I'm saying, I'm not -- it's not like huge disappointment.KELLY: You're tough.MOORE: I'm just, well, look, I'm -- you know, he exists in that office to serve the people of this country, including both the people who voted for him and who didn't vote for him. So...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Is there anybody that...MOORE: But I'm very happy that we've had him for these eight years. Believe me, after what we have before that.KELLY: ... anybody on the GOP side you could get behind?MOORE: I would get behind all of them and take them and push them somewhere. No, on the GOP, you know, I got to say, my grandfather was the head of the Republican Party in the town that I grew up in.And, yes. But back then, a conservative meant that you conserved your money, you had family values, you know, you had -- you know, you conserved the earth, the air, the water, the God's gifts to us. That's what republicans believed back then. And those days seem to be gone. I know it's hard for republicans who have those feelings, and they have nowhere to go right now.KELLY: What -- let's talk about the movie.MOORE: Sure.KELLY: Because the suggestion is, this is just yet another indictment of America. This is what ticks people off about Michael Moore. They think you hate America.MOORE: Yes. I don't get that, because one of the great things about being an American in this great country is the ability to criticize what's going on and try to make it better.KELLY: Yes.MOORE: All my films, I tell people, and there are people watching this right now, because I have never watched, I'll never watch one of his films. If you watch one of my films, you may not agree with me politically, but you'll know three things about me, I love this country, I have a heart, and you will laugh at least half a dozen times during the movie.KELLY: We're getting that feeling just from this interview.MOORE: Well, you know, no need to watch the movie. We could just go another 90 minutes, you and I.KELLY: But is it a war thing? Because you're saying where to invade next. Is that because you're trying to get us to move -- just where Slovakia?MOORE: No, I don't. I don't want anybody to know that we have to stay here.KELLY: I mean, we don't want to. We want to live here. We have the First Amendment, we have the second, we have all these wonderful things here, like the bill of rights that these countries don't have.MOORE: We -- I don't want to live anywhere else. This is the best country to live in. What I want us to do is to aspire to be better. And what we've done is we've helped these European countries since World War II. They have won and had done some great things, in terms of helping their people. Paid maternity leave, school lunches are not crap on Styrofoam tray in France.KELLY: You can take that up with Michelle Obama.MOORE: Yes.KELLY: I used to eat delicious pizzas and cheeseburgers when I was at school. Now it's crap.MOORE: You did not eat a lot of that pizza and cheeseburgers.KELLY: I did. You should have seen me.(CROSSTALK)MOORE: Really? Do you have a photo?KELLY: The gave me and sat me down eight grade and my little friend told me that I was chubby and then I decided -- in that summer I was going to lose some weight.MOORE: Wow.KELLY: Yes. He really is like Dr. Phil. I'm confessing it all.MOORE: And if you can give me some tips afterwards on how to do that I would be... (CROSSTALK)KELLY: I ran every day. I ran.MOORE: Run, OK.KELLY: But really, right now I would recommend the ""F-Factor Diet"" because that is a great book.MOORE: You have that.KELLY: Tanya Zuckerbrot.MOORE: Do you get 10 percent of that?KELLY: No, I don't unfortunately. I just like her and it works.MOORE: You just sold a lot of books.KELLY: Before you leave we're going to give you some fiber crackers. All right, we've got to go.MOORE: Thank you. And before I leave, I just want to say again, you know, Roger Ailes, Rupert Murdoch, you know, it's a -- to get elected president in this country, you have to come on this network. You have to play with ball with this network.Donald Trump today said, I'm not playing ball with this network. That's a historic moment, and it's going to be interesting to see, you know, where the real power is. Trump thinks he doesn't need Fox News. I think Fox News probably has something else to say about that. You know, it will be interesting to see where do the powers that be go with this? I mean, again, you've made this happen. You've caused the crisis that stirs here.KELLY: Stop that! I haven't caused any crisis. I ask the question. I've got to go.MOORE: Yes. You asked a great question, by the way. The war on women.KELLY: Goodbye. Now you're really ruining my rep. I got to get out of here.MOORE: God bless you, Megyn Kelly. We're both Irish, don't forget.KELLY: Nice to meet you.MOORE: I love you. Thank you.KELLY: Thanks for being here.Well, Governor Chris Christie will react to that -- no, he has -- he's going to react to the debate news in moments. Plus, with just days to go until the vote in Iowa, speechwriter Marc Thiessen and Fox News contributor, Guy Benson, they're both contributors, take out -- talks about new evidence that suggests Iowa voters could still be changing their mind and in a big way. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: We are just 48 hours now away from the Fox News Google primetime GOP debate. Has there been any news about that? And while the lineups for both the primetime and the undercard debate are officially set, some new polls suggest that this is truly anyone's game.As nearly one in four Iowa voters say they could still change their minds before Monday's caucuses.Marc Thiessen is a Fox News contributor and former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush. Guy Benson is also a Fox News contributor and co- author of the book ""End of Discussion""Good to see you both. So, I'm just curious.(CROSSTALK)MARC THIESSEN, FORMER GEORGE W. BUSH CHIEF SPEECHWRITER: Good to see you, Megyn.GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Megyn.KELLY: Because ad somebody worked in the Bush administration, Marc, are you starting to like Michael Moore at all, like are you feeling something there?THIESSEN: Boy, that was quite something.KELLY: Yes, no, OK. Just confirming.(CROSSTALK)THIESSEN: I can't believe that I -- I actually agreed with Michael Moore because he said it's a big mistake for Donald Trump to not come to this debate. And he is 20 percent...KELLY: Why? But, OK. But let me challenge you now. I'll play devil's advocate.THIESSEN: Sure.KELLY: Why wouldn't this be good for him, because he can just say, you know what? I don't bow to anybody, and I wanted Kelly off that debate team, they said no. I didn't get my way, I don't care. I'm done.THIESSEN: Three reasons. One, he's run a very smart campaign up till now. And this is his first major misstep. And the reason is quite something -- because he looks like a big baby. His whole premise of his campaign is that he's tougher than all the other candidates out there, democrats and republicans alike.A few months ago, when Bernie Sanders had Black Lives Protesters and push him off the stage, he said how can Bernie Sanders fight ISIS if he can't handle Black Lives Matter? Well, how can Donald Trump handle and could defeat ISIS is he can't handle a few tough questions from Fox News?Running from a fight is not a New York value. And second of all, he's not running against you, he's running against you, Megyn, he's running Ted Cruz and he's going to leave the debate stage entirely to Ted Cruz a few days before an Iowa caucus, where 40 percent of the voters haven't made up their minds yet.He could lose because of this. Iowa voters could be insulted by this. So, this is a big mistake on his part if he doesn't show up. If he does, if he does this and then ends up showing up, then he's dominated the news for few days and done what he does so well. But if he doesn't show up, first big mistake of his campaign.KELLY: Go ahead, Guy. What do you think?BENSON: Well, I'm going to lend my voice to the chorus here and said that of course, Donald Trump should pull on his big boy trousers and show up and answer your questions. You're a journalist; he's running for the presidency. These dramatic histrionics are just exhausting, it's completely silly.Although I would say it's very much like a democrat to refuse to debate on Fox News. So, I agree with Marc Thiessen. I agree with Marc Thiessen, this is a strategic error in the scheme of things for Trump, although Brit Hume said this early, it's absolutely true. It won't -- it won't hurt him with his hard-core supporters.KELLY: Right, right.BENSON: They won't be swayed by anything. But as you say, there are a lot of people who are going to turn out in those caucuses on February 1st, who are really just starting to make up their minds or even tune in for some of the less engage voters and to have Donald Trump just cede the whole stage in the fit of pique it's really is not a good look.KELLY: Well, it's a fit of pique if you're his detractor. It's strength if you love him. You know, if you believe him.BENSON: It's not strength. I wouldn't -- I would dispute that. I don't think it knows any sort of strength. Strength is showing up in the face of something that frustrates you, as opposed to running and wanting about by the way, a completely legit question.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well, he says he's ticked off. He was saying now that he was ticked off by the Fox News statement, you know, which was released after his, I mean, his -- OK.BENSON: OK, sure.KELLY: Who benefits? Who benefits the most if he doesn't show, Marc?THIESSEN: Ted Cruz without a doubt. I mean, look. He is -- he's just pulled ahead of Ted Cruz but only by two points. That's statistically tie. So, he is in neck and neck fight with Ted Cruz for Iowa. And so, Ted Cruz is going to go out on that stage and do you think he is not going to attack Donald Trump because Donald Trump is not there? The only difference is that he's going to more beat.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: He's going to get more time, that's for sure.THIESSEN: Donald -- he's going to have more time and Donald Trump won't be there to answer. And do you think he's going to defend Donald Trump?KELLY: Do you agree, Guy?THIESSEN: I mean, not likely. So, he cede...(CROSSTALK)BENSON: Every one...KELLY: Yes, go ahead, Guy.BENSON: I was just going to say everyone on the stage will have more opportunity to talk and advance their message if Trump isn't there. Ted Cruz, of course, is the biggest beneficiary of that because as Marc noted, it's a very close race. Trump has the momentum in Iowa. He's overtaken Ted Cruz recently. And now I think Cruz, now is a really wide lane to come back and regain some of that momentum.KELLY: All right. We got to leave it at that. We have Chris Christie right after this break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Back to the big story tonight. Just 48 hours out from the final presidential debate on the GOP side, and six days before the first votes are cast in campaign 2016.Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump now says he'll skip the Fox News Google debate.Joining me now with reaction by phone, New Jersey Governor and republican presidential candidate, Chris Christie. Governor Christie, good to be joining us tonight. Your reaction to the news.GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, listen, Megyn, I went through the same, very similar, right? Fox News just demoted me from the main stage to the second debate. I didn't whine, I didn't cry, and I didn't not show up.I went behind the podium and the microphone. I put my views out for the American people. Because that's what you do, and that's what you learn when you're a governor. You can't spare what's going to happen and you're going to get press, you're going to get crises, and national disasters. You got to show up. And that's what I did and that's what everybody should do.KELLY: What do you -- what do you make of the way Trump has handled the media thus far?CHRISTIE: Well, listen. I think -- I think, you know, the media's been handled by him. And I think, you know, folks have allowed him to do things that no other candidate's ever been allowed to do in American presidential history. And if he doesn't show up on Thursday night, listen. That's Donald's choice. But I can show you that Americans...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: How do you think it's going to affect things, how do you think it's going to affect what you do?CHRISTIE: It will give us more time to talk, that's the way I'm affected and that will be good for me and good for the other people on the stage because he doesn't want to be there, that's OK with me. But I tell you this, the American people should wonder, you know, if you're not willing to show up when everything isn't going your way and exactly the way you want to, that's not way the job as governor goes back in.Things don't go my way often, I've got to fight through it and show up for work and battle every day. That's what I'm going to do in this debate comes Thursday and that's what I do when I got sent to the undercard debate and battled my way back. America wants a fighter who shows up.KELLY: Governor Christie, we look forward to seeing you in Iowa.CHRISTIE: I'll see you in Iowa, Megyn. I'm showing up, by the way.KELLY: Me, too. We'll see you there, as well, we hope. Two -- two days now, he has -- he has 48 hours from right now. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: You can watch the final GOP debate before the Iowa caucus this Thursday, January 28, at 9 p.m., right here on Fox News. Bret, Chris, and I will be there for you asking tough but fair questions. Not everyone is showing up. We hope you will. Good night.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

3	3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/15/hillary-clinton-seeks-2b-to-end-big-money-politics/	Hillary Clinton seeks $2B to end big money politics	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" April 15, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Julie Roginsky, Eric Bolling and the scared Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Hillary Clinton is expected to run a $2 billion campaign in her second bid for the White House. But she says she's going to make it a focus of her campaign to get big money out of politics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if that takes the constitutional amendment.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: She said it again today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: We have to start breaking down the divisions that have paralyzed our politics and we have to get rid of the unaccountable money that is flooding into our political system.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Here's one of the reasons Americans might grow cynical on Clinton's first day on the campaign trail. Her Campaign Chairman John Podesta was caught on tape from mingling with liberal donors from the Democracy Alliance in San Francisco, trying to raise the same kind of unaccountable money Clinton was talking about, and so is her ally David Brock of Media Matters. The political action committee America rising got that footage and I think it's no wonder, Eric, that people would see some hypocrisy here between somebody whose gonna raise $2.5 billion and makes $300,000 a speech, funnels all sorts of unaccountable money through the Clinton Foundation to fund her lifestyle.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: 300 grand?PERINO: Yes.BOLLING: A speech?PERINO: Yes.BOLLING: And she's broke?PERINO: And she, well --BOLLING: Dead broke?PERINO: Not anymore.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: OK. So if she did make 300 grand a speech, one speech would hire eight teachers in 36,500. One speech would also hire eight auto mechanics which apparently she likes to hang out with when she delivers her first announcement that she's gonna run for president. 16 Chipotle employees for full year, 5.3 over senate staffers if they're men, because they make -- may 56,000. But she can actually hire 7.3 staffers if their female because, there's a 15,000 -- PERINO: Paid them less.BOLLING: You pay them a lot less 15 grand less in fact. Just a hypocrite alert, I don't know why she wouldn't even talk money. Because every time she opens her mouth about money, she seems to put her foot in it.PERINO: She --BOLLING: Her mouth.PERINO: Greg, she just says she's going to raise $2.5 billion to spend on a race where she is running unopposed in a democratic -- on the democratic side. She must be really worried about the general election. But also she is saying that she wants to change it after she becomes president.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah. How convenient for her. By the way, that tape we had? That was some damning video.PERINO: Yup.GUTFELD: A man standing there just talking to each other. Who -- what could they be talking about? Probably, bombing something. Anyway, I think we misinterpreted it.BOLLING: There it is.GUTFELD: Yes, there it is. Damning video, well done, America. The funny thing is, when she was talking about how she wanted big money out of politics, she was actually referring to an obscure rapper, with had nothing to do with actual campaign contributions. To show you how desperate the media is right now to find any kind of news, because she won't talk about the issues. Everybody is scrambling for something. Jennifer Epstein from Bloomberg, she tweeted. This is really interesting information. Did you know that Hillary's favorite bottled iced tea is Pure Leaf? Compare that to President Obama's which is Honest Tea and Bill Clinton is Wet Tea.PERINO: Did she add that last part? Or did you help her out?GUTFELD: I did that made that one up.PERINO: But that, it just show how absurd.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: I love it.GUTFELD: It is absurd, isn't it?PERINO: It is absurd.GUTFELD: There's a point to this joke, Dana.PERINO: I -- I'm following.GUTFELD: I know.PERINO: Is it over?GUTFELD: I have said enough, thank you.PERINO: OK. Then I will gonna go to Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: I think he has, actually.PERINO: Do you think that they can hear their own tone deafness?GUILFOYLE: -- no. I don't think so. And I don't think they care because, this is what they think, everybody play along, whoever you wants to, get in, run for president. She feels she's gonna be the winner. The big winner, whether she drives in the Scooby van, whether she goes to Chipotle, whether she chooses Text Mac (ph) instead, it's just doesn't matter. She's like, the leader of the circus. But it's funny that she is talking about money because, it's not her strong suit. In fact, it's a (inaudible) on so many levels, showing undue influence, donations to the Clinton Foundation, bad numbers for the economy, all of the above, so that isn't something she should be putting forward. I think the less she's heard from, probably the better off she's going to be, right? Say less and just keep going.PERINO: Probably.GUILFOYLE: Cruising to point 16 (ph).PERINO: The point about the campaign contribution on the left is that she has something that is -- it's a really important issue for people or is it just something I thinks she needs to talk about and they're still gonna write her a hundred thousand dollars check for her pact?JULIE ROGINSKY, GUEST CO-HOST: Both. I mean, the left is upset about Citizens United, they think it's a -- largely think it's a bad decision, but she's also not gonna unilaterally discern (ph). She's not gonna say, OK, because I'm offended by Citizens United and by dark money (ph) politics, but I'm going to take my marbles and go home. So of course it's both. She's gonna continue to raise this money while it's legal.GUILFOYLE: Thinks she likes it, though.ROGINSKY: Well, I don't know. She likes that --PERINO: On Citizens United, allowed for people the right to criticize her. I mean --ROGINSKY: Right.PERINO: But I think that they really don't like is a more recent Supreme Court --ROGINSKY: Well, it's both. Which we lead us -- which I made it from Citizens United but --GUILFOYLE: She just wants the money coming in.ROGINSKY: Of course. But ever person --GUILFOYLE: Clinton love all green, whoever is giving it?ROGINSKY: To be fair, any presidential -- presidential candidate is not going to turn down cash. I mean, George -- sorry, excuse me, Jeb Bush, wants money to come in. All these guys are desperately trying to raise money. You need to raise money to run a campaign. It was a billion dollars last time. It's gonna be, probably two this time. It's a fact of life.BOLLING: Or more --ROGINSKY: Whether you like it or not, or more.BOLLING: Or 2.5 billion.ROGINSKY: Right.BOLLING: So, which makes the discussion about, hey, we have to stop, we have to have financial form, campaign finance reform even more hypocritical. She's gonna be the -- by far, the largest spender in the history of politics.PERINO: Hypocrisy is like --BOLLING: By double.ROGINSKY: But what about --PERINO: It's like a nice form blanket. Let me tell -- let me go to somebody who --BOLLING: And it's -- I'm sorry. It is not coming from $25 donations.ROGINSKY: It's probably coming from both.BOLLING: And well, it's true (ph).PERINO: OK. Let's go to somebody who may try to challenge Hillary in the upcoming election. He made sure to point out the hypocrisy in the swing state of New Hampshire today, here's Chris Christie.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS CHRISTIE, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: I read somewhere today, Secretary Clinton said she wants to -- she intends to raise $2.5 billion for her campaign, but she wants to -- then get the corrupting money out of politics.(LAUGHTER)CHRISTIE: You know, it's classic, right? It's classic politician's speech.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And the New Jersey governor has not announced yet, whether he will in fact run, but if he does, he's not worried about defeating her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HUGH HEWITT, THE HUGH HEWITT SHOW RADIO HOST: Let me ask you then about Mrs. Clinton's campaign. Can you beat her, Chris Christie?CHRISTIE: If I run, I will beat her.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: OK.GUILFOYLE: I love it.PERINO: Can you say that?GUTFELD: I don't know. Beating women?PERINO: I knew you were gonna go there. Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: Do you like that? That this poll (ph) saying, OK, I can win? And like the confidence.GUILFOYLE: 100 percent.PERINO: I knew you'd like that.GUILFOYLE: You have to have a winner. Like somebody who believes in themselves. If you have somebody like, I'm not sure if I'm the one who push this cart up the hill. Get out, beat it. Let's get somebody who is like, I can get this done no matter what and just like bow flex it out. Chris Christie is a hundred percent confident in himself. That if he runs against her, he's going to be able to take her down. That's what you wanna can. You want somebody who is in Quitaque (ph). I mean, I'm not sure or lot like, Candy Crowley steps on them in the debate? No.ROGINSKY: What presidential candidate is going to say, no, I can't -- no, as a matter of fact, I don't think I can beat her. They are all gonna say that. Look, Chris Christie's problem is that Chris Christie has a major (inaudible) scandal that is about to happen some bunch of his aides hanging over Bridgegate. Chris Christie's problem isn't sure he's going to come out (inaudible) as a second to last in the nation. Highest property taxes in the nation has problem in the republican primary, which as a Democrat, I'm very happy that is. First of all, he appointed a bunch of liberal judges, that were democratic diverse, he reappointed them, so thank you, Chris Christie. And secondly, he said he got into politics because he wanted to preserve New Jersey's assault weapons ban. That is a (inaudible), right Eric?BOLLING: It's some -- those are the two points I wrote down.ROGINSKY: Are you stealing my notes?BOLLING: No. I wrote this earlier.ROGINSKY: Yeah.BOLLING: In the day, saying that -- look, everyone loves the attitude that Chris Christie brings but, he's got a lot of problems right here --GUILFOYLE: I don't disagree.BOLLING: He's got second amendment problems in New Jersey --GUILFOYLE: I don't disagree. I don't like him for those reasons.BOLLING: He's got credit problems In New Jersey, he -- when he came into office he said, I'm lowering property taxes. You know what? He did. Within two years, they are higher than when he started, than before he started. So, Chris Christie has a lot of explaining to do.ROGINSKY: Yeah.BOLLING: If you get the -- the conservative vote, which he probably won't. He makes it some sort of, you know, a quasi-conservative vote.PERINO: But in his to the --BOLLING: But he is a good --GUILFOYLE: He's got swagger. He's got swagger.BOLLING: A good candidate, that's why, right.GUILFOYLE: Swagger.PERINO: He -- at least -- every candidate is going to come to some -- come to the race with things that they are going to have to defend and at least I think that he found that like he's willing to step into the arena. There's something to be said for that?GUTFELD: Yeah. We spent the last seven years or so, six or seven years ignoring external threats in favor of internal strife. And the person who is able to articulate a vision that reverse that is going to win, because we're tired of beating each other up. We're tired of being powerless abroad. You've got terror spreading through ISIS, you got Putin selling arms and you got a cyber tax at 40 percent. The number one concern among the American public is, concern -- is national security. So you don't need a grad study. You need a gargoyle (ph) and Christie --GUILFOYLE: Wait a second.GUTFELD: Christie looks like something that could go toe to toe with Putin in Iran -- with Putin or Iran and he has a forceful personality which -- compared to kind of the aloofness of Hillary, it could benefit him.BOLLING: Can I add one more thing? Can I add one more positive thing on Christie, to (inaudible). He is the first one who came out with something - - he's not running for president yet, but he talked about reforming social security.PERINO: I actually have a sound bite for that.BOLLING: You do?PERINO: Can I play that and go back to you?BOLLING: Sure.PERINO: All right. So, this is him earlier today, when he's talking about his plans to reform the country's entitlement system. He is the only one really talking about this so far.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIE: Our entitlement system is out of control. Its growth is not sustainable. But let's confront the problem head-on, let's come together for a better America and not sit idly by war prospect fade and this president leads our divisions to go out. I'm not afraid to tell you the truth as I see it, whether you like it or not. I want to help lead the national conversation that rewards truth over pandering. That rewards innovation over the timidity and the status quo, and that honors the power of our history over the fear of failure. So I think that's what leadership is really all about.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: You like the entitlement reform?BOLLING: Yeah -- and he do it. I think he's spot on with some of that. He's talking about reforming social security that the raising the age from 65, the retirement age from 65 to 67. Also means testing some, some recipients, which is -- I think this the only way to solve the problem going forward. However, as Julie points out, he has so many dark clouds waiting to rain on his parade.ROGINSKY: Terrible.BOLLING: It's --PERINO: Well before there, I mean, until there are actual clouds that are actually raining, maybe we should let the justice system work it out if it's gonna be the case.BOLLING: Sure.PERINO: Kimberly, do you like when he talks about -- price (ph) him a harsh truth to voters, even if it means that they might not wanna talk about the fact that social security will have to be revamped?GUILFOYLE: Of course I do. I like somebody who is direct, to I think it will pander. When we talk about political pandering, I'm so sick of it, having been in politics for so many years, coming out in San Francisco and the politics from California, my God. So someone who is not afraid to stand to unions, to talk about social security reform, talk about Medicare reform, talk about -- you know, economic -- all of that, let's get somebody in like that. Do I think he's gonna be the guy? No. But at least he's stimulating the conversation. I don't think he's going to be the chosen one but, get the talk out there.ROGINSKY: Let's be clear about something with Chris Christie. He has pandered time and again in every issue. He used to be pro-choice then he became pro-life. He used to be pro-massively pro-gun control, now he's --PERINO: What about Hillary Clinton?ROGINSKY: But wait a second. The reason I say that is he's not a straight shooter. He's not a straight talker and he can't --PERINO: Like being against gay marriage and being for it.ROGINSKY: You know what? You're absolutely right. She flip-flopped on that, but he's flip-flopped, but he's not going around saying, I'm the truth teller and the only truth teller on the planet. He's going around saying, I'm a truth teller? Give me a break --GUILFOYLE: You know, but that's the different. That's about having different evolving ideas and perhaps, shifting your opinion about something. That is a very different from saying I have the courage to stand up to you and to you and to you --ROGINSKY: Except it never has.GUILFOYLE: Bolling, look me in the eye and you J.R.ROGINSKY: But it never has.PERINO: I mean, is this personal?(LAUGHTER)ROGINSKY: With Christie?PERINO: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: You really don't like him.ROGINSKY: I really -- I actually know, I actually know him on a personal level. I actually like him on a personal level, but I think he's a complete disaster when it comes to governing. And I say that because my parents live in New Jersey, I'm from New Jersey, I've seen at first hand. Eric, you nailed it.BOLLING: I will take --ROGINSKY: The economy is terrible.BOLLING: There are two things that -- personally, there are extremely.ROGINSKY: Yeah.BOLLING: Important to me. Number one, taxes and number two, the second amendment. And -- if he were president, I'd be concerned about both of them.PERINO: All right.GUTFELD: See, I disagree. You can't do much good in the world if you think you are bad in the world, and that's what we've been dealing with for seven years. Obama was incredibly positive about himself, but he wasn't positive about the role of the United States, in America. So the 2016 winner has to be all about America and not about himself. We've had enough of the brooding professor, it's time to have a positive salesman, that's where the foreign policy comes in and economy comes second. I don't think America is going to be that concerned over the tax policies in New Jersey -- it don't (ph).ROGINSKY: Well, it is, if it's a (inaudible) to a tax policy would be in America, right? If he raise taxes in New Jersey --GUILFOYLE: I just to think that --ROGINSKY: I think that's probably -- GUILFOYLE: That's one macro cause in dealing with New Jersey and the fiscal problems that they have, but if you look at it in a more like macro sense, I don't think it can be applicable --BOLLING: K.G., who he appointed the judge --GUILFOYLE: To the majority of the United States.BOLLING: Look at the judges he appointed in New Jersey, it's a huge problem.GUILFOYLE: OK --BOLLING: It's a big problem for conservatives.GUILFOYLE: Listen, I'm just gonna back and forth, keep this on a high level.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: But I'm not saying this is my guy. I'm not like saying, hey, you come first --PERINO: We're gonna, we're gonna get out of here and go to the next segment, anyway. So next, the CEO cuts his own salary to gives his employees a big high raise. But will his redistribution plan actually (inaudible) company in the long term. Eric thinks so and he's gonna tell you why, coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: So you seen the CEO of the Seattle based company who raised the minimum wage at his credit card processing company to $70,000 per year? Dan Price dropped his own salary from a million (inaudible) to 70 grand as well. Here's how his employees took all the news.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP) BOLLING: And here's the man of the hour.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAN PRICE, GRAVITY PAYMENTS CEO: What you see is inequality in this country is getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And a lot of times people are proposing government solution like in Seattle where I live, we have the $15 an hour minimum wage. And for me, that's a sign of failure that we didn't self-regulate and self-govern. And had we done things like this, there'll be no need for announcement.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's in entity (ph).(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So a CEO doing right by his employees, closing the income inequality gap, sounds great, right? Well not so fast. This is a publicity stunt. Gravity Payments is only making $2 million a year profit. Price just dropped the minimum payroll -- minimum payroll of $9 million onto his books. So, when Gravity makes a PR for doing the cool thing, will ultimately ruin the company. And God help the next genius CEO to follow Dan Price (inaudible). Gravity will pull all them down into the dust pile of great ideas on paper, but not in business. Sorry, kids no free lunch. The smartest thing anyone ever said about business, simple but still holds true. Dana? Sounds great. People love it. Everyone that saw this guy, all over the news today, on Barney's show that was - he did the Today show, they -- oh, what a great guy. OK, it's fine.PERINO: But -- well, OK, that's fine, right? It's a free market. He's making the decision.BOLLING: It's definitely the free market.PERINO: And maybe it's a suicide mission for his company, but at least he's making it and then his company will have to either win or lose in the future. But at least the government is not involved.BOLLING: The government is definitely not involved, so you can call free market, but I would not call it capitalism, I'd call it -- I don't know, giving it away.GUTFELD: It is -- I mean, you're both right. The government isn't dictating this, I for that. As long as the government doesn't get involved in wage controls -- I'm OK. He can bankrupt his company, he --this is precisely the opposite thing you would do to get the help like use unemployment, by raising all of these. And then -- imagine the guy who makes -- let's say a guy makes 10 bucks an hour and he goes to 15 but the guy who makes 15 it's like going, wait a minute I have more used experience and education than a guy making 10, I make 15, I want 20. So what happens is if all ends up moving everything up. The interesting thing about this was great piece by Steven Quartz in the New York Times. He showed that consumerism is what improves lifestyle that the debate on minimum wage cannot, by supplying a status that is based on lifestyle and brands. You don't have to be rich to be happy. That's why when they are studying happiness and inequality, as inequality wide and happiness, that isn't effective.BOLLING: K.G., and that's where why he picked 70,000 bucks, because there was a study that said at 70 grand, you actually start to experience happiness. But this isn't in business that --GUILFOYLE: I think he did this, it's a nice like PR move, he's getting a lot of play out of it, he's hitting all of them. You know net worth, the cable, to everybody talking about it and now, a company I've never heard of in my life, now I know it, right? So people are going to get involved, get interested, look him up, I mean, I was thinking like, it was pretty dateable until he went total comey (ph) --(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: To Seattle grunge rocker.BOLLING: Yeah. This way, you'll know Dan Price for a really long time.GUILFOYLE: Why?BOLLING: Multi sets the way he is. He is a good PR, he's a good salesman. He ain't gonna know gravity paying him for a long time on.GUILFOYLE: OK.BOLLING: It's interesting.GUILFOYLE: OK, I'll take your word for it.BOLLING: So is he taking down this whole 130 -- people working for him, is he taking down for the sake of himself?ROGINSKY: I think it remains to be seen. Look, they are thrilled about this, so apparently not. I -- you know what? Why he didn't he become a comey (ph) I think it's quite the opposite. He's a libertarian. He said I don't want government involved. I'm gonna this, I'm going to determine my own path and I'm going to determine what my company is going to do.BOLLING: Julie, he didn't --ROGINSKY: Why Not?BOLLING: Because he didn't -- the market dictates wages, not one guy, not the government.ROGINSKY: Wait --BOLLING: Either one guy (ph).ROGINSKY: You're telling me that if I want to give my assistant -- it's my company, I want to give him a raise tomorrow, I can't do it.BOLLING: Of course you can.ROGINSKY: Because of the market, so what's the problem?PERINO: You think you should give your assistant a raise.ROGINSKY: You know what? My assistant is making more money than I think I am.BOLLING: Do you have an assistant?ROGINSKY: I am. That's how important I am.BOLLING: You have an assistant?GUTFELD: I'm not -- can I think it inexistent.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: A man Friday.ROGINSKY: You're like -- yeah, well, we're not gonna talk what you do for me, but -- yeah, but he --GUILFOYLE: He's a little --GUTFELD: Disgusting.GUILFOYLE: He's a little man sandwich, a little morsel.BOLLING: All good? All right, let's leave it right there.GUILFOYLE: No, no. He's a nice guy. We get it. You don't like him, it doesn't go --BOLLING: No, I'm fine with him. In fact, what I'm going to do tomorrow on Barney also turn to sided with your point of view, Julie, some of saying --ROGINSKY: For once Barney and I agree.BOLLING: Tomorrow, it's gonna Barney that I argue with.GUTFELD: But -- I urge you to read this --GUILFOYLE: Why don't you book --GUTFELD: This article.ROGINSKY: I did.GUTFELD: It's amazing. Because it made me think, when you -- whenever you see a line at the Apple store, you don't see any class barriers. It's everybody. You can't tell who is making more money than that, because basically, our capitalist, consumers society is so awesome that everybody can pretty much enjoy the same lifestyle and maybe you can go concierge on certain things and get off for this and for that. But, you know, when a student can have an iPhone or an iPad.PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: You are doing all right.ROGINSKY: Thank you Barack Obama.GUILFOYLE: I think he's doing pretty great.ROGINSKY: That's Obama's America for he's right.GUILFOYLE: He's going to get a lot of dates out of it.GUTFELD: You caught me.ROGINSKY: I knew it.BOLLING: That's --GUILFOYLE: Oh my, God.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: That's actually peak of the next segment, very well. Yes, the Communism has kept Cuba in an economic time warp and some on the mainstream media would like things to stay that way, now that ties have been restored with the U.S., next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: So, as relation with Cuba Thaw outcome the idiots with limited access to suffering, who recast cast pain as charming. CNN international's James Williams and Daisy Carrington, urge travelers to visit Cuba before its decaying infrastructure disappears.GUILFOYLE: YeahGUTFELD: Oh yes, the delights of poverty. It's pain transformed into a coffee table book, something to enjoy as long as it's not your own country. Even MSNBC, whatever that is worries that our tourist dollars could harm this paradise of prosecution.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MELISSA HARRIS-PERRY, MSNBC HOST: I worry about American tourist and the way instead we can sometimes be a plague on the rest of the world particularly, in this nation that become high tourist economies. And I'm wondering if there is a downside to our economic ties opening up with Cuba -- for Cuba.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: No.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: And so instead.GUILFOYLE: No.GUTFELD: They look at awful buildings and think, ah, what a great picture for my wall. They see chipped paint peeling from rented hotels and think, character. I can't wait to tell my friends in New York how authentic this is. Maybe I'll get married here. They don't see the abject poverty of those working in these conditions, so the pain, communism cause or the tyrant responsible. Yes, the very dictators that the American left so admired, who kept this suffering alive, as they hoarded the good stuff for themselves. The idea that destitute -- destitution is cool, and our consumer is a toxic, it's not just evil, it's old. So the first comey (ph) weird it's ugly head, there was a well-off westerner patting it softly while bodies stacked up. But for those of you worried that the consequences of communism are being raised -- chin up. There's still Venezuela, they just ran out of toilet paper, which sucks when you're full of crap.GUILFOYLE: Eww.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: It's like --GUTFELD: That was a metaphor.GUILFOYLE: So --GUTFELD: Kimberly, metaphor.GUILFOYLE: Metaphor.GUTFELD: Analogy.GUILFOYLE: Analogy.GUTFELD: All right, because you just still talking and no one knows what you are saying.GUILFOYLE: I'm sure you don't care of what I'm saying, go ahead.GUTFELD: All right. That's not true, I care.GUILFOYLE: No. I mean, it.GUTFELD: I'm lying.GUILFOYLE: I mean, in a very positive confident way.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: A (inaudible).GUTFELD: What's worst? A romantic ravages of communism or the crashness (ph) of tourism?GUILFOYLE: Oh. That is a really tough of choice, and it depends on who the tourist are.GUTFELD: Hmm.GUILFOYLE: I think --GUTFELD: American tourists are tacky, according to MSNBC.GUILFOYLE: I'm not going to go there. I love America, and I love Americans.GUTFELD: That's great.GUILFOYLE: So I'll take all the tourists.GUTFELD: It's a daring statement.GUILFOYLE: The problem is, is that people need to inform themselves about the facts, about what's gone on, the history in Cuba, the suffering there. The fact that the prisons are filled with political opposers [SIC], people that have been persecuted because of their beliefs of trying to have freedom of speech.And now all of a sudden, Cuba is the darling of the Obamas, of the de Blasios of the world, and they just want everyone, you know, feast your eyes on this, this workers' paradise, where everyone is equally as poor. That is not what this country stands for.How about doing something positive by saying, ""We're going to lift this if you, in fact, do something about the economy, the way you value your currency, start paying people the value of the work that they do. Then let's talk""?GUTFELD: You know, Julie, isn't this really about destitute destinations, like going there and turning pain into novelty?ROGINSKY: Yes. We all feel better about ourselves, right? We go, we spend a little money, we help the poor, destitute people.I kind of see the point of the CNN guys by saying from a tourist perspective, you're not going to find this, at least in the Western Hemisphere, too many other places. So I kind of understand.GUILFOYLE: I hear they're hiring.ROGINSKY: Yes, exactly. The value of that -- thanks. But -- but let me tell you, that that's -- I mean, Melissa Paris -- Melissa Harris-Perry, I don't even know her name, but that -- what a crazy thing to say.GUTFELD: Yes. You know what it is?ROGINSKY: I mean, that's insane.GUTFELD: Here's a good comparison. When East and West Germany reunited, I went to a museum in Berlin that shows an apartment from East Germany and what it's like to live in East Germany. I don't think Cuba is going to do that. They're not. They're going to -- how can we have a free and open conversation or diplomatic ties with a dictator in our own hemisphere?BOLLING: Because I think they have to open up. I think they have to. And I'm one of the ones on the right who thinks this is a good idea, one of the few, apparently, on the right that thinks this is a good idea.GUILFOYLE: Well, if can be, if it's handled property, yes.BOLLING: We'll take it from the straight business -- yes, if it's handled properly. No. 1, first and foremost, Cuban government can't be involved in every business the way they are right now. You want to do business, any agriculture or retail, anything, you have to go through -- the Cuban government is their partner. You can't do that anymore. You have to break that. And I think that's being worked on.And No. 2, you have to float the currency. Let the currency be -- let it stand on its own and float, and then you can start to do business with the country.Eleven million new customers. For 40 years, they haven't bought -- they haven't bought anything: no iPhones, no corn flakes, so Sara Lee cupcakes, whatever. There's a huge demand. There's tens of billions of dollars of opportunity for American businesses, but the human rights issues, you have to get over.GUTFELD: Cop killers over there.GUILFOYLE: Right. They have them. They're harboring fugitives.BOLLING: Is it a big if, but if you can fix those things and is it...GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: I mean, there are other countries that...GUILFOYLE: You know, Bolling, when I look at you, all I'm seeing is that you are, like, on the first ticket over there to whatever new Ritz is going to be built, with the hot tub, the magic views, the shirt off.BOLLING: And who's going to be on the second ticket?GUILFOYLE: ""Oh, no. Don't call me blanco gordito.""GUTFELD: We'll be getting that -- we'll be getting the shirtless Eric Bolling shot.GUILFOYLE: In Cuba.ROGINSKY: Remember that scene out of ""Godfather 2""?BOLLING: Gordito blanco.ROGINSKY: Gordito blanco.GUILFOYLE: That's what I said to you. I said it. You know it.GUTFELD: Exactly. Beat-up convertible Chevy driving down the street.BOLLING: You know you want to be in that.GUTFELD: Yes. I'll be in the back seat.Dana, people see this sort of thing as authentic. They're afraid that America is going to come in and take away the authentic pain and...PERINO: So all those things that he just described, all the products, great American products and brands that Cubans have not been able to buy but could in the future, that's what Melissa Harris-Perry is talking about.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: They don't want to ruin Cuba with American products.GUTFELD: With good things.PERINO: They don't want Americans with white tennis shoes...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ... to deface the Cuba that is their imagination. Remember when we talked about this a year ago, they were worried that there would be an McDonald's.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: Or Hillary Clinton's favorite, the Chipotle.The thing I find interesting about this argument from the left about the worry about Americans going there, as if Americans is bad...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: You see there's a pattern there. It's that the left also uses and President Obama uses the fact that America can be a force for good in Cuba in order to try to get support behind his approach to try and open up Cuba.GUTFELD: Yes. Right.PERINO: And so MSNBC should maybe get with the program.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: ... not what the president wants.GUTFELD: What are they getting right -- what are people going to Cuba getting right now in Cuba? Nothing legal, because it's all in -- you hear stories.GUILFOYLE: Cigar smuggling.ROGINSKY: And let me tell you this: the first McDonald's in Moscow opened up in 1990. I happened to be there for that. There were lines like around -- like a mile down.PERINO: And no matter what, if I could say one last thing about this, if America is going to go down this path, and if Americans are going to go there, just please keep in mind that the workers that you're seeing there is not getting paid...GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: ... the kind of money that is going directly to the government. How we deal with the government treating its people there matters. It's not just a great tourist destination which maybe it will be in a few years.GUILFOYLE: We agree. Simpatico.PERINO: I don't like that. Think about the women in particular.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Who are under the thumb of the government, looking for pesos when the government is getting paid with your tourist dollars, and that includes you, Europe.GUTFELD: Good point, Dana.GUILFOYLE: Vacation in America. Keep it all here for the cash.GUTFELD: There you go. All right. Well done, K.G.GUILFOYLE: You're welcome.GUTFELD: Up next, Megyn Kelly tried to get an answer from the head of the DNC on where Democrats stand on late-term abortions. See how that went, coming up on ""The Five.""GUILFOYLE: It looks like it went well.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been embroiled in a big spat with GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul over where Democrats stand on late-term abortions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Why don't we ask the DNC, is it OK to kill a seven-pound baby in the uterus? You go back and you ask them.WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Is he right when he says that it's OK, from your perspective, to kill a 7-pound baby in uterus? Is that your position?DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, CHAIRMAN, DNC: We have very different definitions of personal liberty. I made that clear in my response. The Democratic Party's position is that we are pro-choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Interesting sidestep. Last night on ""The Kelly File,"" Megyn tried to get Wasserman Schultz to clarify.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: You would admit that you can't have women aborting third-trimester babies just on a whim? Right? I mean, so you agree there are some limits?WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Certainly not on a whim. But when a doctor...KELLY: But that's what he's trying to get at, you know? Where do the Democrats stand on, you know, should...WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: We've been very clear. There's no ambivalence here.I can't tell you a specific date and time past which we -- on all -- in all cases are certain that that choice shouldn't be made, because that decision is very unique and individual to the woman and should be in consultation with her conscience and her god and her doctor. That is a decision left to her.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Unbelievable. If she can't say it, then why doesn't she educate herself about the issues and read up on it and understand it and care about life in general and, you know, babies have rights, too -- Julie.ROGINSKY: Well, thanks for coming to me on that. So I think, look, what I think she's trying to say is, if it's a baby who is perfectly healthy in the ninth month or the seventh month, no doctor is going to abort it, and no doctor should abort it.PERINO: Why doesn't she say that?ROGINSKY: I think that's what she did say.PERINO: She didn't say that.ROGINSKY: She was talking about doctors. And when it comes down to doctors, if a baby is severely disabled, she believes that that baby should have the right to be aborted. I think that's what she's trying to get at.PERINO: Wow.ROGINSKY: I'm not speaking for myself. I'm speaking for what she thinks.GUTFELD: The baby should have the right?PERINO: Yes, a baby.GUILFOYLE: I don't get that.ROGINSKY: I'm sorry. The doctor should have the right. The parents should have the right.GUILFOYLE: The doctor should have the right?ROGINSKY: Correct. Not the baby.GUILFOYLE: You mean the doctor should have the authority to do it, and the mother should make the decision.ROGINSKY: Right.GUILFOYLE: Because that doesn't cover the baby's right. The baby does not have a voice. It's relying on sane and rational people with a compassionate heart to make some noise on its path.ROGINSKY: No. To make compassionate choices, and maybe the compassionate choice, in her view, was if the baby was severely disabled and would be born in a lot of pain, the compassion of choice would be to have an abortion. I believe that's what she's getting at.Don't send me -- by the way, don't send me crazy tweets about this. I'm thinking for what I think she says.BOLLING: You'll get them.ROGINSKY: That's not what I'm saying.GUTFELD: The only late-term abortion liberals are against is the death penalty.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: The left cannot go deep on this, and here's why. Whether it's minimum wage or policing or abortion, their argument begins and ends with the slogan. Whatever is on the sign is as far as they get. Because if you go to the next step in this issue, you are faced with a moral path in which you have to decide what is life and what isn't life.And that's where she had no answer. It wasn't because she poorly articulated. It's because she knew that the answer pointed to her own black hole, that she could not -- she could not say what is life. But she knew what it -- she knew she was wrong, and it leads to a lot of unsavory conclusions that the Democrats always avoid.The true war on women was the one-child policy in China. The unsavory fact is that once you know more -- once people know more about a child, they're going to have the possibility to selectively choose and selectively abort that child. It could be over gender. It could be over orientation.PERINO: Eye color.GUTFELD: It could be over physical features; it could be over color. That's where -- those are the moral paths that go beyond the sign that has the slogan.GUILFOYLE: That's true. I mean, Bolling it sounds like, well, they're for the death penalty for babies.BOLLING: Well, and the bigger question is, why would she agree to go on Megyn and get completely destroyed like that? She knew it was coming, because it was -- that was a back and forth between Rand Paul and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that led up to that. Megyn did the right thing and pinned her down, saying, ""Well, where are you on this?""And she spent, I don't know, a minute or so saying, basically, it's -- we're pro-choice, and the mother has the right to choose what she wants to do.GUILFOYLE: Right. Personal liberty.BOLLING: Instead, she could have either, A, said that or, B, decided not to go on and try and run around. And Greg's right: It's something they can't -- they cannot go deep on. They can't do a deep dialogue on. So they have to stay either far out, 64,000 feet, or just talk like I'm doing right now.GUILFOYLE: Dana Perino, lovely in persimmon.PERINO: Thank you. Protection of the innocent is something that we have dealt with as a country, your inalienable right to live. And if you are a baby, then you don't have -- you don't have the voice, and so you need someone to protect you.Life is precious. It is a gift. And the question in front of America for a long time, and increasingly so, as science improves, is do we have a responsibility to protect the innocent? And because science has improved, people see more images. They start to know more people that think, ""Well, my niece was born at six months into the pregnancy, and she's now, you know, a 24-year-old, very successful young woman who's contributing greatly on cybersecurity in this country.""I mean, there are personal stories now that are feeding into this, and that's changing.But let me tell you something else that happened big-time last night. If you think back to the George Stephanopoulos interview where he asked Romney about contraception, he thought that was a fair question for Romney. Some people disagreed. But nobody has asked the Democrats about this position and really pressed them on this. It's always Republicans who seem to be unable to get out of any sort of debate without having to talk about some sort of right-to-life issue or pro-choice issue.For the first time, you really saw Debbie Wasserman Schultz grilled by Megyn Kelly. And I think that is a great service for the upcoming debate, because it's one about the protection of the innocent, one that is -- it's important for us. It's bigger than Social Security reform or tax reform or even national security. Protection of the innocent should be a platform that we talk about in 2016.GUILFOYLE: I agree. I hope they're listening.Next, something that can make it even harder for America's unemployed to get a job. Personality tests. And Julie explains when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ROGINSKY: Could your personality keep you from getting a job before you go into an interview? The Wall Street Journal reports more and more companies are requiring applicants to take online personality tests to help screen any new hires.So Kimberly, I'm going to go to you. This sounds kind of...GUILFOYLE: Personality plus.ROGINSKY: You've got such a great personality.You know, this sounds to me kind of like an online dating situation where they're trying to, like, mesh people.GUILFOYLE: Yes, but it works there, too. I mean, it works there...PERINO: Wouldn't you prefer to have an in-person interview, though, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: No problem.PERINO: OK.GUILFOYLE: Whatever. Online, in person.PERINO: It doesn't matter?GUILFOYLE: Sure. Would I like to be in person in front of somebody and like full on get it on -- I mean, three-dimensional.ROGINSKY: We're talking about jobs here, not dating.GUILFOYLE: You know what I'm saying. Three-dimensional, not just, OK, we're on a screen, or we're facetiming or we're doing some kind of online - - yes. Put your best foot forward, because then you have the opportunity to dress well, speak well, be in front of them. They can get a sense of your personality, who you are, and lot about first impressions for how you present yourself during the interview.ROGINSKY: I agree. But Eric, you know, this company that they're talking about in Buffalo is actually turning people away, even though they have a ton of vacancies, because they're not getting the right amount -- the right kind of people, which I think is interesting.BOLLING: This is really good business, too. Because one of the biggest costs of business isn't necessarily tangible. It's people leaving. So you have a great person who gets stolen away from your company. To retrain for that position is phenomenally expensive. CEOs, one of their biggest problems is replacement costs. Training and whatnot, people, not replacement of capital equipment, of actual people. So knowing that there's not going to be a personality conflict before they're hired helps down the road after they're hired.ROGINSKY: Yes, Greg, I mean, look, a lot of places -- look, everybody here sort of meshes in their personality, and that's why you guys all work together. To some extent that works. On the other hand, as Kimberly said, you don't really know what somebody's personality is unless you get to meet them and hang out with them and get to really know them and measure them.GUTFELD: This is discrimination against jerks; it's jerkist. What if you have a lousy personality but you're great a work?By the way, when I interview people, I do a series of grueling tests, generally measuring their fitness, because I like people to be in shape. I take them to what's called an activity pit, which is something I built in my back yard. I supply the singlets (ph). And whoever emerges victorious from the grappling, I hire. The others, well, we have to eat.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.BOLLING: Wait, wait. You could save a lot of time and money. Just Chuck E. Cheese. Just bring them right to the ball pit at Chuck E. Cheese works.GUTFELD: I can't go to the ball pit after what happened.ROGINSKY: Are you banned?GUILFOYLE: Aren't you banned from Chuck E. Cheese?GUTFELD: There's a dress code. I didn't know.ROGINSKY: I don't know, Dana. I think this was a good idea.PERINO: Terrible.ROGINSKY: Because I think people...PERINO: I think that whether we like it or not, it is the trend and it is the future. And I grabbed this because I'd seen it. It's a book called ""Work Rules"" by Laszlo Bock. It's kind of heavy, but he runs human resources for Google. And I think one of the things that they have done is revolutionized the way that people are hiring -- that kind of Silicon Valley look at hiring is now morphing into other places like in Buffalo, where they are looking at personality to make sure that they can -- you could teach somebody to do something, but are you going to want to work with that person? That's their No. 1 question. Do you want to work with someone?GUTFELD: You didn't read this.PERINO: No, I haven't read it yet. Did you see this little sticky note, though? I'm going to read it.GUTFELD: Oh, does that mean...PERINO: That's chapter four.GUTFELD: Tom's book.ROGINSKY: We've got to go, my friend. You've got to talk about Chuck E. Cheese. And ""One More Thing"" is up next.GUILFOYLE: That's more than you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing"" -- Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: So this is a really important message for women's health, that Rita Wilson, who is the wife of Tom Hanks, recently found out she was diagnosed with breast cancer. And she successfully underwent a bilateral reconstruction last week with the support of her husband.That might not have happened if percent she hadn't received a second opinion, and she has a really compelling message to women to make sure to encourage them, if you're having the instinct, kind of that feeling, I want to make certain, and you have kind of a questionable diagnosis. And with respect to Rita, she actually got another pathologist to read the labs. And that's when she found that, in fact, she was -- you know, had cancer. And then a third pathologist confirmed that, as well. So -- and it was at the suggestion of a friend. So there you go. Anyway, very proud of her and thank her for sharing this personal story.PERINO: Good point. All right -- Eric.BOLLING: So, 2:49 two years ago, 2:49 p.m. two years ago, the Tsarnaev brothers killed three and wounded 260 at the Boston Marathon. A moment of silence was held in Boston. Here's a little of that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(BELLS RINGING)(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And then at Fenway Park, the Red Sox were playing the Nationals. They broke into that game, and this happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, we are one Boston. Ladies and gentlemen, we are Boston strong.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right.BOLLING: And we are Boston strong.PERINO: Nice one. All right. Greg.GUTFELD: All right. It is time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Crime Corner.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: All right, America. You don't do the crime if you can't do the time. This is Gainesville, Florida. There were two young pups terrorizing a young innocent black cat. But were they prepared for what they were about to experience?Watch closely as they approach this innocent feline, hoping to get something they were never to enjoy. And then, finally, they get cocky. This one comes over.GUILFOYLE: Whoa!GUTFELD: Looks like you're all wet, doggie.PERINO: Very good Crime Corner.GUTFELD: Thank you.GUILFOYLE: My goodness.PERINO: All right. It's not just in your head. The airlines are heading downward on every measure, collectively declined in on-time performance, involuntary denied boardings, mishandled baggage and customer complaints. America has taken notice. And we're demanding airlines please get it together. I've got a book tour coming up.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.PERINO: For everybody.GUILFOYLE: Get a private plane.BOLLING: Ticket prices aren't coming up.PERINO: Oh, Eric, you would go to that. Money, money.All right. Julie.GUILFOYLE: Julie.ROGINSKY: All right. So if you know me, you know I love, love, love classic rock. The Who is kicking off its 50th anniversary -- the Who is kicking off its 50th anniversary tour down in Florida tonight. I cannot wait to see them. I'm seeing them in Madison Square Garden in October. If you're going to go see them, let me know how the show is. I'm super psyched. And I know people who love...GUTFELD: I love ""Stairway to Heaven.""GUILFOYLE: That sounds like...ROGINSKY: ""Stairway to Heaven"" is an excellent Who song, otherwise covered...GUTFELD: ""Free Bird"" is amazing.ROGINSKY: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Sounds like you want someone to take you. Chris Christie.ROGINSKY: I am being taken -- really? I already have a date. But I might anyway.PERINO: You can talk about Chris Christie while you're there.All right.
