This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAN CATHY, CEO, CHICK-FIL-A: I think we are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, you know, we know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage. And I pray God's mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think we have the audacity to try to redefine what marriage is all about.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy two weeks ago saying that he supports and his restaurant supports traditional marriage. Well, that set off a firestorm in cities like Chicago, and Boston, and Washington, D.C., those mayors saying that that restaurant is not welcome. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAHM EMANUEL, D - CHICAGO MAYOR: Chick-fil-A's values are not Chicago values. They are not respectful of our residents, our neighbors, and our family members. And if you are going to part of the Chicago community you should reflect the Chicago values.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, today, thousands and thousands of people around the country showed up at Chick-fil-A's. We had pictures of drive-thrus going around the block a couple of times. We have had lines in malls at Chick- fil-A's that went out and around looping around, supporting this organization and supporting this restaurant and really making a political statement. What about this? Let's bring in the panel. Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think it simply is astonishing hearing Rahm Emanuel defining according to his political ideas who is welcome and who is not welcome in Chicago. Look, everybody has a right to a boycott. To boycott whatever he wants or to organize a boycott, it's a free country. But once you get government doing it, with the powers of police and taxation, imposing its views on somebody excluding them or punishing them, not for a commission of a crime, which is what government is supposed to do, but because of the expression of a view, that is thought police. That is political repression. There really is no other word for that.And think about this. What is Dan Cathy saying in his opposition to gays and marriage that is different, that is incongruent with the position that the President of the United States Barack Obama held six months ago on the same issue? He was opposed to gay marriage. Does that mean that for the first three months of the Obama presidency he was a bigot, who was deserving of ostracism and social punishment? And remember, Rahm Emanuel was his chief of chief of staff at the beginning of that, was also on the position -- also supported the position being against gay marriage. I think this is just an astonishing overreach and an abuse of power.BAIER: Byron, you had the D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray send out a tweet with the hashtag ""hate chicken."" You have people all over the country reacting one way or another. It seems like it got a lot of attention today.BYRON YORK, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well it did, and I think that we saw a lot of Chick-fil-A values at Chick-fil-A restaurants all around the country. I think the governmental part of this is just about over. Thomas Menino, the mayor of Boston and Rahm Emanuel are backing down from their positions. The ACLU has come out in favor of Chick-fil-A in the limited issue of a business license, saying that government should not deny a business license to someone because they don't like their social views. So I think that is pretty much over because we have seen enormous amount of support for exactly what Chick-fil-A said.And by the way the way, there are a lot of businesses whose owners have social views. The head of Amazon.com, the founder just donated $2.5 million to support gay marriage in Washington state. And of course Ben & Jerry's ice cream, famous for having all sorts of political positions. So it's not that unusual. It just hasn't resulted in something like this before.BAIER: And Juan, this comes with a backdrop of Democrats for the national convention in Charlotte thinking about and probably adding support of gay marriage as a plank to their convention platform. Is that politically risky for Democrats considering what they're seeing today and the fallout from this story?JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: No, I don't think it's too politically risky. Clearly, the Democratic base is not alarmed by having gay marriage in the platform. I think it would antagonize people who were in line for Chick-fil-A today, but I think most of those people were making a political statement as you said earlier, Bret, and in line with Governor Mike Huckabee and others, talk show radio show hosts, who have come out and said that as a political matter they support Chick-fil-A and they want to make their support known.Personally, I got to tell you something, I am a big free speech advocate. I have been punished for saying the wrong thing in my life and career. And I just think that Mr. Cathy has the right to express his point of view. I think that when you -- at this time in America where you have such a massive family breakdown it and so many kids who don't have families, it's an important statement to also say you support family structure of any kind. You're not condemning families where grandma may be raising a child or you know, a cousin, or whatever. I think what he just spoke about marriage in the traditional sense, I think that's what antagonized people like Rahm Emanuel, who felt that he was being very limited, very rigid in his point of view. But I don't care how rigid he is, government has no role in telling Chick-fil-A where they can establish based on the values of their owner. I just think that was wrong. And I think that is why Americans and more and more elected officials now are rejecting that point of view.BAIER: OK, we will continue to follow it. Panel, as always, thank you very much from Washington. Stay tuned here for some final thoughts from Los Angeles. Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/11/25/gov-chris-christie-experience-is-needed-in-white-house/	Gov. Chris Christie: Experience is needed in the White House	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" November 24, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, 'SPECIAL REPORT,' HOST: The renewed focus on and fears about terrorism are becoming a big issue in the 2016 race for president. Tonight, I'm joined by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to talk about the terror threat along with several other issues facing candidates.Governor, thanks for being here.Happy to be here, Bret.BAIER: So, today, you have this Turkish shoot-down of a Russian pilot, Russian jet along the border there with Syria and Turkey. If it's President Christie, what are you doing?GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, first off, you're speaking to our allies, to the Turks, getting all the information you can on exactly what happened. What the circumstances were. And you need to continue to support our allies.I mean, if in fact the facts are true, that they were warned many times, the Russians were warned many times and they went into Turkish air space, well, then, this is what has to happen. And the Russians need to understand if you're going to operate in that part of the world, you have to operate in way that's cooperative and not in the way that's provocative.BAIER: This is, though, like three-dimensional chess. And now you have a lot of players and they all have their own motives.CHRISTIE: No question. This is complicated stuff. But that's why you need someone who is experienced, Bret. You don't need somebody who's just been, you know, blowing hot air about this in a subcommittee on Capitol Hill. You need somebody's experience in making decisions, building relationships in the way that you do as a governor when you're in an executive position.BAIER: Pointing to senators in this race, I assume?CHRISTIE: Yes, sir.BAIER: Well, here's what Marco Rubio said today about his experience on foreign policy on these issues.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When the president was calling ISIS the J.V. team, I was warning that this group was a very dangerous group. They had the capability to grow rapidly. Not just in these debates and during this campaign but over the last four and a half years, I have shown better judgment and better understanding of these issues quite frankly and with all due respect than anyone else running for president.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Your reaction?CHRISTIE: You know, he hasn't made any decisions. You know, it's all well and good to be sitting on Capitol Hill, to be giving opinions, because there's no consequence to those opinions, ever, when you are up there.When you are the executive, there's consequences to every decision you make. You're held accountable for every decision you make. And you have to make those decisions in light of that and not flinch from them. You don't need to run when the weather gets hot, on Capitol Hill or at the White House or in a foreign capital, you can't go running. You got to stick. And you got to stick by the decisions you've made.BAIER: You were the head of the RGA and going into this race, it was the presumed thought that governors were going to run the roost. They were going to be the best-positioned to be the nominee.If you look at it, Governor Perry dropped out, Governor Walker dropped out, Governor Jindal dropped out. If we look at the ""Real Clear Politics"" average of polls, you know, you're standing at 3 percent. You have Governor Kasich behind you at 2.8 percent. Governor Bush at 5.5 percent.What do you think is happening with governors? And why is it not taking off for governors?CHRISTIE: I don't think it's about governors. I think it's that the public is really angry with government in general. And so anybody at the moment who is associated with government was getting hit in that way. And underperforming what people thought they might have performed. But I think as we get closer to people actually voting, especially in the aftermath of these attacks, new seems nice until you need experience.And we need experience and we need someone who's experienced in making these decisions, who has fought against terrorism by making decisions, not just talking about it and debating on the floor of somebody. And I think they're going to turn to those folks and I think I'm the person they're going to turn to.BAIER: Your sense of the president and how he's reacted to the Paris attacks, first in Turkey, and then today, standing next to Francois Hollande.CHRISTIE: Listen, the president was a petulant child in Turkey. You know, there are legitimate concerns being raised about the Syrian refugee crisis. And I'm one of the folks who's raised them. When the FBI director says that he can't effectively vet these people. That should be the end of the conversation.BAIER: He cited today that Francois Hollande is going to take at least 30,000 Syrian -- additional Syrian refugees over the next two years. Saying that the U.S. needs to step up as well.You disagree?CHRISTIE: I do. I disagree, because we cannot effectively vet these folks. And until we can, the president of the United States' first obligation is national security. The safety and security of the American people.BAIER: So when Francois Hollande comes in and says, you know what, I really like you to get to work with Russia because we think that could be a good coalition against ISIS. You would say no?CHRISTIE: I would say Mr. President, show me some objective indication that they have an interest in that and then I'm happy to listen. But until that time, there's no objective, no objective evidence that they're interested in fighting ISIS. They're interested in being in Syria to prop up Assad, who is always been their ally and who they want to remain in place in power as their ally regardless of his murderous conduct as a dictator in Syria.BAIER: You have been told that you were going to be the U.S. attorney prior to 9/11.CHRISTIE: September 10th.BAIER: So you, kind of -- obviously, were aware of what was going on during that time.CHRISTIE: Oh yes.BAIER: I heard you the other day in this whole back and forth about Donald Trump when he said thousands and thousands of Muslims were cheering in Jersey City. I heard you say you didn't remember.CHRISTIE: I don't recall that. I don't recall it happening.BAIER: It didn't happen?CHRISTIE: I don't think it did, no. I mean, listen, it was a very emotional day for me, Bret, so the only proviso I was giving on Sunday was my wife and my brother were within two and five blocks of the World Trade Center that day. And it went hours and hours before I could find either one of them. So it was an emotional day for me on a personal level and we lost a number of friends that day. But as I said before, if that had happened, I'd recall it and I don't.BAIER: So other campaigns think that, you know, you're obviously aggressive, you're a brawler when it comes to politics. But they think that you're holding back when it comes to Donald Trump. Are you?CHRISTIE: No. Not at all. When I disagreed with Donald and I've talked about it many times. If we have disagreements, I disagree. And I have disagreed publicly and I just disagreed now, you know. And I did that on Sunday. I said I just don't recall that happening. I don't. And so I don't think it did.BAIER: Alex P. Keaton, something tells me that's not his name. I'm not sure. But does Chris Christie have a strategy to beat Trump in Iowa and New Hampshire? Does he think anyone can catch the Donald?CHRISTIE: Sure. And my strategy is the same one I've had all along in New Hampshire. I spent more days in New Hampshire than any other candidate by far. There are more town hall meetings in New Hampshire than anybody by far. And everyone is starting to see that that's catching on now. That work takes some time.You're building a foundation of support of people who are not just going to answer a poll, but would actually come out and vote and get their neighbors and friends to come out and vote. That's the way New Hampshire has always been won, Bret, and that's the way it will be won this time.BAIER: The New York Times, which is a paper that doesn't give you a lot of great ink --(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: You're the understatement of the cycle.BAIER: Yes - said about New Hampshire, ""For the first time, a solid majority of Republican voters in the state of New Hampshire have a favorable view of the governor. According to two polls, a remarkable turnaround from the depths of his unpopularity.""So what has happened? Is it just time?CHRISTIE: Hard work. Hard work and being clear and specific on the issues. Our campaign has been more detailed than any other campaign. You go to our Web site. We have more detailed proposals. We speak about them in-depth. And when I do town hall meetings, there are no pre-canned questions.I stand there for two hours and take questions on any topic from any comer. And I think that the people in New Hampshire are starting to notice that they've got somebody on their hands who is willing to take any question, willing to decide and lead and we're starting to create momentum there.BAIER: Republicans in New Hampshire are giving you another look, it seems. But what about Republicans in New Jersey? Why shouldn't people look to Republicans in New Jersey, who know you best, and say, that's really the people we should be talking about.CHRISTIE: Well, listen, folks in New Jersey re-elected me with 61 percent of the vote in 2013. And since that time I ran the RGA, and now I'm running for president.BAIER: So they're mad?CHRISTIE: Yes. Listen, whenever you are looking for a new job and you've got one, people always get a little miffed. You know, I'm sure here at Fox, if you were going to interview at some other network, they wouldn't be thrilled about it, of course not.But that means, I think there would be a little bit of a lowering of your popularity, let's say at Fox. I think that's what's happened in New Jersey. But in the end, when they really had to decide, the opportunity to decide, my fate, 61 percent of all voters in New Jersey re-elected me in office and I think that's the thing that really matters.BAIER: But when you look at the economy and I ask you this in the first debate and you look at the performance of New Jersey, if people look at that in just a microcosm, why would they say that you are best positioned to run the economy of the U.S.?CHRISTIE: Because I took an economy that was literally moribund and now has created 220,000 new private-sector jobs.Last month, New Jersey created more jobs than any other state in the union. Our jobless claims are the lowest they've been in 15 years and our unemployment rate is down to 5.4 percent, which is the lowest it's been since 2008 before I got to office.So the fact is that we've brought that economy back. Now still we have enormous headwinds. Taxes are too high and a Democratic legislature won't lower them. That's the one place we haven't been able to find bipartisan agreement. But, you know, the fact is that the economy is much better in New Jersey than it was when I got there six years ago.BAIER: Gun control, is it true that the issue of gun control inspired you to get into politics?CHRISTIE: No. That's not true. No.BAIER: Well, in 1993, you said you were motivated to run for office by supporting, preserving New Jersey's assault weapons ban.(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: You know, I don't remember saying that so, you know, we'll see.BAIER: ""The issue which has motivated me to get into this race is the recent attempt by certain Republican legislators to repeal New Jersey's ban on assault weapons."" That was in 1993.CHRISTIE: That's 22 years ago?BAIER: Yes.CHRISTIE: Bret, I don't remember. I could have. It doesn't sound like me.BAIER: You think the ""Star-Ledger"" is wrong?CHRISTIE: I know it's never been before. (INAUDIBLE)(CROSSTALK)BAIER: All right, well, let me turn it this way. If you don't think that motivated you like you said.CHRISTIE: No.BAIER: .apparently back then --CHRISTIE: No, I don't think it did. I know it.BAIER: Where are you now?CHRISTIE: Well, listen, my record is really clear on this in New Jersey. We have taken a lot of steps to make sure that gun rights are protected in New Jersey. I vetoed a decrease in the magazine from 15 to 10. We vetoed a ban on the 50-caliber rifle. We vetoed a state-wide I.D. card in New Jersey, all because it didn't increase safety.BAIER: Politics, we showed the poll earlier. You put a lot of chips in New Hampshire. Spent a lot of time there. Do you have to come in one, two, three in New Hampshire for this campaign to continue?CHRISTIE: I have to do well. I mean, let's see -- let's see where --BAIER: One, two, three?CHRISTIE: I don't know, Bret. Let's see where we are in January. It's kind of hard to tell now. Let's see -- you know, have me back in January, and then you can ask me one, two, three and I promise you I'll answer.BAIER: Sounds good.CHRISTIE: All right?BAIER: Governor, thanks.CHRISTIE: Thank you, Bret.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2009/05/14/politics-ridicule	The Politics of Ridicule	"Robust debate is vital to America. It can put complicated issues in focus and sometimes exposes charlatans. Stating your case with strength and dignity is the sign of a patriot.But in today's political landscape, ridicule is on the rise, and both the left and the right are using it:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID SHUSTER, MSNBC: She lied. She avoided taking personal responsibility. She blamed others.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Perez Hilton, the judge was on MSNBC.MICHAEL SAVAGE, RADIO HOST: I don't know who that sick, fat pervert is, and I never want to hear his name.LOU DOBBS, CNN: We'll be talking also about Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. Guess what? That little love affair with his fellow socialist Barack Obama didn't last long.ANN COULTER, AUTHOR: To be fair, Obama is the person now most likely to put -- or to have poison put in his coffee by Hillary, but that's only because Bill Clinton stopped eating and drinking around Hillary years ago.JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Bush was even kind of a walking punch line. I mean, he's just, you know, and he doesn't mess up as much as Bush.MICHAEL MUSTO, VILLAGE VOICE COLUMNIST: I know for a fact that Carrie Prejean was Harry Prejean, a homophobic man who liked marriage so much he did it three times. Now he's a babe who needs a brain implant. Maybe they can inject some fat from her butt.(END VIDEO CLIP)Now, let's put this into perspective. Talk radio has always had its share of hate-mongers. Some right-wingers make a living doing this. And on the left, the Air America network was all hate all the time, but went bankrupt.Then a couple of years ago, NBC News began peddling hate on its cable network.Then a few months ago, the Obama administration tried to brand the Republican Party as a place of fanaticism. The White House actually increased the power of Rush Limbaugh by trying to ridicule him.But here's the question: Are these tactics an accident, or is there something deeper here?Enter far-left philosopher Saul Alinsky, a Chicago rabble-rouser who died in 1972. Hillary Clinton actually did a thesis on Alinsky while studying at Wellesley College in Massachusetts.Before he died, Alinsky wrote a book called ""Rules for Radicals,"" and here is where the politics of ridicule was defined. According to Alinsky, in order to change America into a far-left bastion, traditional Americans must be marginalized. Alinsky lays it out in radical rule five: ""Ridicule is man's most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also, it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage.""That is exactly the tactic the hate-mongers at NBC are using, and very close to the White House-Republican deal.Alinsky also layed out how to attack opponents in rule four: ""You can kill them, for they can no more obey their own rules than the Christian church can live up to Christianity.""Alinsky's saying that because no traditional person is perfect, any sin can be used against them. The American press does this all day long.The Alinsky principles are followed by a variety of left-wing organizations, including the Developing Communities Project in Chicago, where Barack Obama worked in the late 1980s. That's not to say the president is a disciple of Alinsky's, but he surely knows what the man put out there, as do many committed liberal Americans.So the politics of ridicule is no accident. It is a game plan, a blueprint. It is currently being used by a major TV news organization, and perhaps by the White House itself.Now you know.And that's ""The Memo.""Pinheads & PatriotsSixty-two-year-old Cher continues to performs in Las Vegas and around the country, and she's still in pretty good shape.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nice costume you got there.CHER, SINGER: What do you mean, costume? This is not my costume. I already did my show. I'm going to K-Mart in this.(END VIDEO CLIP)I'm sure the shoppers will appreciate that. Whether it's a patriotic gesture is up to you.But there is no doubt on the pinhead front, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his wife were treated this way in Washington:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: War criminal. War criminal. War criminal. Arrest this man. Arrest the war criminal. I wish I had some handcuffs to arrest this man. He is responsible for the death of millions of people. War criminal.(END VIDEO CLIP)That protester is obviously a pinhead. You can make your point in a much more dignified manner."
6	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/07/24/debating-politics-gun-control/	All-Star Panel: Debating the politics of gun control	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" July 23, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I hope that over the next several days, next several weeks, and next several months we all reflect on how we can do something about some of the senseless violence that ends up marring this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHANNON BREAM, ANCHOR: The president in Colorado yesterday after visiting with families, victims, and loved ones of the shooting there, talking about what comes next. Let's talk about that with our panel because the debate about gun control almost always surfaces as part of the conversation as we look in the wake of these tragedies. David, it doesn't seem like though from the White House or anywhere on Capitol Hill there's really an appetite for reigniting that debate.DAVID DRUCKER, REPORTER, ROLL CALL: I don't think so. The politics on this has actually been settled for quite some time. But I think let's look at this historically when we did have the debate over gun control in the 80s and the early 90s you generally had Republicans on one side who would side with the Second Amendment and not wanting to infringe upon that. You'd have a lot of Democrats who were in favor of more gun control, Bill Clinton famously, which helped lead to the 1994 Republican revolution if you really look at how that midterm played out.And ever since the 2000 election which was the last time a Democratic candidate pushed for major gun control on the trail, most Democrats who have been elected to office in Washington have been very strong Second Amendment advocates. They have come from culturally conservative areas.  That's how the Democrats built their 2006 House majority and Senate majority. And have been just as pro Second Amendment, if you will as the Republicans.So while the NRA gets a lot of credit and the gun lobby - so-called - is very strong and is definitely not going to let anything happen without a fight. I think the truth is you have Democrats as well as Republicans who have run saying they don't want to do anything more in terms of passing more gun control legislation. Most famously, last cycle you had Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, using a gun to shoot a poster of ObamaCare on a tree. So there you have it. It's bipartisan. It's been settled. And unless there's a public outcry demanding this, I don't think you're going to see a change.BREAM: One of the folks who has been a leader on discussing possibly more control I in this area has been Senator Dianne Feinstein. I want to play a little bit of what she had to say on ""Fox News Sunday"" as well as Senator Ron Johnson.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D - CA: We've got to sit down and really come to grips with what is sold to the average citizen in America.  I have no problem with people being licensed buying a firearm. But these are weapons that you're only going to be using to kill people in close combat.SEN. RON JOHNSON, R - WI: This isn't an issue about guns, this is just really an issue about sick, demented individuals and it's a tragedy and I don't think there's a solution in Washington to solve this problem.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: But A.B. when she brings up -- Senator Feinstein brings up that issue about the type of ammunition that used here, do you think that's a conversation some people are interested in having?A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: Well, David's right, not the Democrats, the dwindling culturally conservative Democrats who support Second Amendment rights and who are getting voted out of office at a rapid pace and the voters themselves who are rapidly supporting the Republican party more and more as the years pass, President Obama doesn't want to alienate any of the ones that are left.Senator Feinstein is speaking to an issue that President Obama can only dance around now, which is that none of the legally obtained easily purchased online types of weapons that the Colorado gunman bought or the volume of ammunition that he stockpiled, none of this is used for sport. None of it is used for self-defense.But President Obama pointed to an editorial he wrote in an Arizona paper as his clarifying statement this week that he wrote a year ago after Gabby Giffords and her constituents were shot saying that he supports the protection of Second Right Amendment rights that allow people to legally buy them.  This suspect was not a criminal. He didn't have -- he bought everything legally, and President Obama supports what he did. And he is not coming out and neither are other Democrats to change those laws.BREAM: One independent senator -- he identifies as an independent, Joe Lieberman has said late this afternoon some comments from him saying, Charles, that nobody wants to take this on because, quote, ""the gun lobby is that strong.""CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, the problem for Lieberman is the gun lobby is the majority of the American people. It's not a lobby that starting all this, the reason that the lobby's strong is because it represents overwhelming opinion in the United States. And how do we know that? The President of the United States, who had this tremendous opening if he wanted to push the issue of guns after a tragedy of this magnitude, could easily have done it. And he assiduously stayed away from it because he knows it's a losing political proposition. Liberals in the country want gun control, Democrats don't. They normally overlap, but not on this. Democrats will not go near this because of the experience, as we heard a little earlier about in 1994, and they don't want to repeat that again. We're at the height of an election year and they're not going to go near it. So you're going to have a lot of discussion on the talk shows, you're going to have none in Congress and nothing will happen in terms of legislation.BREAM: Well, something else Lieberman mentioned was buying all this ammunition over the internet, as you mentioned A.B. He said it worries him because if that amount of ammunition is being used and bought, it should be a concern and raising a red flag about terrorism so there might be something to be done about online purchases.  David, do you think there will be any appetite even for that segment of the argument?DRUCKER: I don't know that there's going to be an appetite for it but I do think at some time if some lawmakers want to talk about how you legally buy ammunition and guns, it's possible to have that discussion without it being as damaging, if you make it clear that the issue is not so much whether you can buy it but just the venue and the quantities. There has been voter approval for background checks and things of that nature, and so I don't know that that's the problem. But anything in reaction to this tragedy, I think people are walking gingerly around it anyway because of the politics of it.BREAM: Alright thank you very much, panel.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.
