This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Greg Gutfeld along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Katie Pavlich, this is ""The Five.""So at an Earth Day thing at the National Mall, activists made an unearthly mess. I guess if your heart's in the right place, the trash can go anywhere. No wonder this guy was crying.(BEGIN PSA VIDEO CLIP)NARRATOR: People start pollution. People can stop it.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: You can keep crying pal, because it's never about the Earth but ego and retribution. Take Bill Nye, the Denial Gguy, bragging on Twitter about flying with President Obama today. See for him, it's all about status. The attention bestowed for parroting the right platitudes. It's why he can get away with blaming the Jews for fleeing Europe.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL MAHER, HBO'S REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER HOST: Netanyahu is asking European Jews to come to Israel and --BILL NYE, SCIENCE EDUCATOR: Come home to Israel. That's what he said, right?MAHER: Yeah.NYE: Yeah.MAHER: Well I mean, he is the --NYE: But you never -- the people have never been there. They live, grew up in whatever, in Germany, France.MAHER: It's a shame that she should have to move.NYE: Well they probably won't, either, because it's not their home.(LAUGHTER)NYE: What do you do about it? I think you get to know your neighbors. That's -- it's going to take -- will does it take a century, something like that?(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Oh, science. I suppose that if they were polar bears, he'd feel differently. The scarier belief however, is that climate change poses a greater threat than terror. It's fine from loony ludites, but the president, yikes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Today, there's no greater threat to our planet than climate change. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risk to our national security.Climate change can no longer be denied or ignored.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I call this the ""strawpocalypse,"" a mix of straw man and Armageddon. Sure the Earth's end trumps everything, but with that absurd comparison, then we should devote nothing to present danger and only fight future figments of imagination. It's nuts.But Republicans must do better. If you say the science isn't settled, then you cannot dismiss warming out of hand. You need to be persuasive even when they mock you -- and they will mock you, as Earth Day is Christmas for Earth's avengers. For most climate change activists, it's less about carbon and more about consumers and consumerism and trashing the systems that saves countless lives. For the green movement believes that the root of every evil is a beating human heart. Their bile toward human enterprise is the howl of the non-productive, nurtured on bitter slogans. I'm here to help, they tell the Earth. If the Earth could talk, she'd say, please, get lost.So Eric, Bill Nye -- I have a theory. Can I -- I think he's making up for lost time. But now he's finally getting attention. Isn't that what his is about?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: But the wrong -- it probably is, he's try (ph) that narcissistic that he needs that attention. I literally saw that tweet and I go -- he is spoofing himself, right?GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: If Nye was -- I'm going to fly to D.C. and get a ride on Air Force One on Earth Day. You know the carbon footprint of what he's about to do? OK. So let's talk about the science a little bit.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: Energy production is at a 30-year high in America. Air and water are at the cleanest levels in 45 years. Food production is at -- is 40 percent higher than it was 65 years ago at its all-time high, and life expectancies are at their high. So I'm not sure that all these -- you know Armageddon theories, Apocalypse that are coming to President Obama and Bill Nye and you know, the same people who are -- the types of people that were doing it 40, 50 years ago, will they wrong then and then can be wrong again now.GUTFELD: Yeah, it's true. It's like -- Juan, I wanna play a SOT, sound on tape from President Obama on Earth Day, talking about how we don't have time.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Folks don't have time. We don't have time. You do not have time to deny the effects of climate change. The next generation, they are way ahead of us in understanding how important this is. Let's make sure we don't disappoint them. Let's stand up and do what is right before it's too late.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So Juan, this isn't a new message that American Enterprise Institute has 18 great predictions including, people saying like, a harbor biologist saying the estimate that civilization will end within 15 to 30 years. That's in 1970. So doesn't -- isn't it -- does it not kind of set off your skeptical mind when you hear we don't have time?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Of course. But I think you have to understand, it's a political message that's being delivered by President Obama. He wants to get people excited, energized. I think it's only half of Americans agree.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: That there is a critical issue with global warming. The other half are like not convinced. You know, some say it's man-made, some say it's not, some say we're not sure, not proven. So, there's a lot of skepticism out there, it's not any shortage of it. But I would say this in response to my friend Eric Bolling, in back in the '70s and '80s the people haven't taking steps to clean like the air over Los Angeles and the river in this country, including the river right out here in New York where I grew up. We wouldn't have the high numbers that you're talking about --BOLLING: The highest -- and best cleanest water and air, the food Production stuff --WILLIAMS: Yeah, because guess what? People did something. They didn't pretend.BOLLING: But they --WILLIAMS: Nothing was going on.BOLLING: But -- that's not the case here. Now we're talking about -- you know, carbon emissions, you're talking about putting onerous regulation on automakers. You're talking about taking further steps.WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: Our planet seems to be doing quite nice right now.WILLIAMS: Yeah, in other words, if things are getting worse, if in the last -- since 2000 if --BOLLING: They are not getting worse.WILLIAMS: Since 2000, you've had the 15 warmest years.KATIE PAVLICH, GUEST CO-HOST: That is not true.BOLLING: No, no, no.WILLIAMS: On recorded history. Then you can say --KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Where are you getting hot? No, no, no.WILLIAMS: Things are getting wrong, things are getting bad.GUTFELD: Juan, that is --GUILFOYLE: Oh, Juan.GUTFELD: Juan, but that, that statement is up for debate.WILLIAMS: It's not up for debate.GUTFELD: No, it's --WILLIAMS: I'm fine. Let's debate it.GUTFELD: It should flatlining.WILLIAMS: There was a flatline. But I'm just saying --GUTFELD: Flatlining.WILLIAMS: Basically, basically then, it's warmer, even if it's flatlining, what you see is getting warmer. And let's debate it, but let's not ignore it.PAVLICH: There's also data that shows before humans were as what carbon dioxide that they are now, that we have warmer periods of time. A hundred years ago, 200 years ago and the bottom line is that the free market system is actually why we've been able to clean up the environment through innovation, through ideas and through people developing these new products to help clean up the environment. I agree with you that it's necessary to keep the environment clean but we can't do it through the eco fascists who want to attack capitalism who have turned the environmental into a socialist movement. You go out and you go to (inaudible) that they have and you see the things that they are talking about. They are talking about tearing down capitalism but we look in all over the world, the systems of government, where they don't have a free market system, they have the dirtiest environment, whereas we look here.WILLIAMS: Eco, Eco-fascist.PAVLICH: We have the cleanest environment. Yes.WILLIAMS: No, I hadn't heard that. Eco-fascist.GUTFELD: Well --WILLIAMS: So your argument is not with the idea of doing something. You just don't like the fact that most of these people are liberals?PAVLICH: No, but --GUTFELD: No --PAVLICH: Do the environmentalists have created a lot of the environmental of problems that we have in this country, including the wildfires out west, the California drought that is happening now. Those are created by environmentalists, big government policies.WILLIAMS: So how? --PAVLICH: That has taking the free market out of that system.WILLIAMS: How they create fires?BOLLING: Can I -- can I jump --(CROSSTALK)PAVLICH: Let me explain right now. I'd be happy to give you more information.GUILFOYLE: I know.GUTFELD: Before you -- before we destroyed Juan's argument. I want to get Kimberly in here.GUILFOYLE: Poor Juan.GUTFELD: How did you celebrate Earth Day? I notice you are wearing black.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I'm wearing black and I'm just looking for a few good private planes to get on. What can I tell you? Much like the president, right? With the 9,000 gallons of fuel, that it is going to take to go to the Everglades. I mean, the hypocrisy is just replete. The cup spills it over in D.C. But yet, they keep want to be hysterical about it, because it's political pandering. It feeds their hungry little groups, they're little like, oh, these are the people that are going to put us in, this are the people that will give support, whatever foundation Obama does when he gets out. And that's what they are doing? It's just, it's just ingenuous and it doesn't make sense when you look at the fact. That's why I find it abhorrent.GUTFELD: Juan, Juan, can I address what my problem with this, and why it's a tough debate, it's because -- how do you solve or address a problem when they keep exaggerating the end results.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: Of what could happen? With (inaudible) -- like no one has really talked about president -- when President Obama said that his children, his child got asthma and he blames it on climate change. That's not science. If that's -- that's what you would call a distortion. How can you have a reasonable debate with people who are constantly changing the panic? They are moving the panic to a greater wave of hysteria?WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know if that is true because, in fact, there are more people now with asthma and more children suffering from asthma than we've ever seen.GUTFELD: But he was -- he also smoked. Why can't -- isn't it more plausible that it's from secondhand smoke?WILLIAMS: Definitely could be. I don't know. I don't know that he can prove it.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: I think that's your point, right?GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: He can't prove it. But my point to you is we do have a larger number of young people who are suffering from asthma today than ever.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Go ahead.PAVLICH: I mean, I think that you have to look at this idea that it goes to this overall picture of you're a denier or you have skepticism about a certain topic. You automatically don't count and your opinion doesn't count and we can't have a debate. There are plenty of scientists actually including the co-founder of Greenpeace, co-founder of the weather channel who don't believe global warming is about an argument in the first place either. But we're not allowed to listen to them and not allowed to have a discussion in this debate. President Obama is not allowing them to stand with them in the Everglades. And they are inviting Bill Nye who by the way is worshipped in our public schools across the country by our science teachers so, you know they automatically shut down debate and call you with denier when you bring up different facts that are opposed to the ones that they say are settled.WILLIAMS: Well --GUTFELD: You can't deny is that the Earth Day co-founder Ira Einhorn killed and composted his girlfriend in 19 -- what? 1977?PAVLICH: Yes, he did.WILLIAMS: This is a horror movie.GUTFELD: Yeah. That is true. He -- that is a new definition of flower power. The poor woman --GUILFOYLE: Wow.GUTFELD: Poor woman, her name was Helenmatics (ph) of I remember Ira Einhorn in Green Day, but Green --GUILFOYLE: Earth Day.GUTFELD: Earth Day, but they don't remember her name. I want to bring up Eric -- what happens when they focus on the environment and put it ahead of things like terror. This is the president of the United States on MSNBC.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I think the Islamic world is going through a process where they have to isolate and push out the kind of extremism that we've seen expressed by ISISL. And that's a generational project. But, I remind People that -- you know, that there actually is probably less war and less violence around the world today, than there might have been 30, 40 years ago.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Is it really about shifting priorities?BOLLING: Yeah. And again, he said on numerous occasions, they are the biggest threat to national security is the climate, is the air, is the water -- I mean, a based on what? Founded in what? And again, he's also the guy who said JV is the --GUILFOYLE: ISIS to JV.BOLLING: ISIS to JV team. Al-Qaeda is on its heels, they are on the run. Is the guys been accurate about anything yet?GUILFOYLE: No. BOLLING: Anything at all?GUILFOYLE: It is opposite day for him, remember?BOLLING: That's what we said it's opposite day.GUILFOYLE: We discovered that opposite day.BOLLING: Moon Day.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: No, let me just say, the pentagon said it.BOLLING: What? Says what?WILLIAMS: That in fact, global warming is a threat to our national security. It's a threat to -- not only our health, our food supply, it's a threat to cities, it's a threat to tourist, and then everything.BOLLING: But where, where based in what, Juan?GUTFELD: Yeah. Now we did it wrong.BOLLING: I just show you we have 40 percent higher production -- food production per capital than we did 50 -- 60 years.WILLIAMS: Let me just tell you, if you have coastal areas being flooded --PAVLICH: You but --BOLLING: You don't.WILLIAMS: What I'm saying if --BOLLING: You don't.WILLIAMS: You don't hear the I-F?PAVLICH: Yes.BOLLING: All right. Can I --PAVLICH: Juan, let me tell you about --BOLLING: One -- one quick example.PAVLICH: Let me tell you a secret.BOLLING: In California.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: There's a drought going on.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: Right? Why?WILLIAMS: We can't prove --BOLLING: But why?WILLIAMS: We don't know why.GUILFOYLE: Yes you may (ph).BOLLING: You do, Juan.WILLIAMS: Oh, why is it?BOLLING: California gets, it gets --GUILFOYLE: We don't know why.BOLLING: 71 million yard acres of runoff -- water runoff a year.WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: They use 42 million. They have a 30 million surplus of water runoff, but they divert it and it goes into the Pacific Ocean, why? Because they want to save some fish and wildlife in the Delta region. That's exactly what --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Anything that just -- bananas. Why would you want to save any wildlife?PAVLICH: Juan --BOLLING: Because at risk of killing human beings --PAVLICH: Juan. Here's, here's --(CROSSTALK)PAVLICH: Here's a secret.WILLIAMS: OK.PAVLICH: We go to the Grand Canyon Arizona. You can find seashell fossils at the Grand Canyon. Why is that? Because it used to be under an ocean. So yes, the climate changes, it's been climbing -- their exchanging for billions of years. This whole idea that we're going to have these oceans rising, we don't have any time, it's all built on this idea of implementing more government and making people give some of their freedoms in order to implement this plan. But to President Obama's comment about saying that the world is a safer place now, it's not as violent. I take huge issue with that. Just yesterday, in Greta show, she showed 90,000 Iraqis fleeing ISIS. You have 200,000 plus people killed in Syria in the past five years. Mexico, 50,000 people killed in the drug war there since 2006. I mean, for him to say that is really not taking into consideration, a loss of human life and the story of his tenure.WILLIAMS: Well, for you to say that is not taking into consideration the facts that he has been proven over and over again. We have less war, less people dying from armed conflict in the world today than we've had -- I think it's ever. So it's you know, you go back and look at things like Civil War, World War II, Vietnam, a lot of people dying in state-sponsored arm conflict. We don't have that today and that's why he's able to say that accurately.PAVLICH: I'm not sure.GUTFELD: But there are atrocities everywhere. He came --PAVLICH: Yeah.GUTFELD: I mean this is the guy that you will not call what happened to the Armenians genocide, right?WILLIAMS: That's a political issue and you know that.GUTFELD: Yes. Yes.WILLIAMS: I mean, that's why, that's why, I mean, other president haven't say --GUTFELD: That's why I hate politics.WILLIAMS: And that's why the Armenians.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: To this day when ads saying, don't forget what happened to us.GUTFELD: Yeah, I agree, I agree. And I would say about the drought in California, you smelled it, you dealt it.BOLLING: You dealt it. Absolutely.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: What does Hillary Clinton stand for? One of her former campaign chairs gloats that he knows, and then seconds later, he can't answer, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: What a song, solid (ph). Where does Hillary Clinton stand on the major issues? Well, one of her former top guys doesn't even know. So how does she expect the American voters to? Here's William Shaheen who helped run Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign in New Hampshire.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAM SHAHEEN, CLINTON'S '08 NEW HAMPSHIRE CO-CHAIR: She hasn't changed at all. I mean, it -- she's still the same person. If you asked her on 10 different items or issues what she stands on, I could tell you what they are without listening to them. How she feels about trade, I know where she stands.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How does she feel about the Keystone Pipeline?SHAHEEN: That -- that, I don't know.(LAUGHTER)SHAHEEN: That's probably number 10.UNIDENTIIFED MALE: William, you said a second ago you knew where she stood on trade. So, do you know where she stands on this deal or not?SHAHEEN: I don't know where she stands on that particular deal.UNIDENTIIFED MALE: OK.SHAHEEN: I do not.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Whoops.GUTFELD: Oops.GUILFOYLE: Maybe that's a problem. But where does she stand on the pipeline, Mr. Bolling?BOLLING: I don't know where she stands on the pipeline. But I'm not one of the Hillary Clinton's (inaudible), I'm guessing --GUILFOYLE: It says (inaudible).BOLLING: But don't forget, I think she's pro-pipeline because, if I'm not mistaken when she was secretary of state, they sent the -- Department of State was told to do make do an assessment of the Keystone Pipeline. I think they came back with it wasn't going to have a huge environmental effect.(CROSSTALK) BOLLING: It shouldn't affect -- it should have an impact. So I guess under her state department, she would be in agreement with the Keystone Pipeline. But this guy wasn't asked about gay marriage or wasn't asked about Wall Street reform, because those are two things that now knowing, will he (inaudible) not know where she stood. She's involved on both of those. So he said, she hasn't changed on any, she actually has changed on at least these two.GUILFOYLE: Little bit of hopscotch, OK. Equipment coach, what do you say?GUTFELD: No, but -- I don't blame this guy. Because nobody knows what she - - I mean he said, she says nothing on foreign policy, she was secretary of state, that's like being Chef Boyardee in having your opinion on meatballs. It makes us -- and you're right though, about -- about gay marriage. She's coming out for equal pay, which is on the books. Gay marriage isn't on the books. So that would be the question around the country it's not on the books. There isn't a federal thing. They should be going to her for that, but they won't, because they don't want to embarrass her, they don't want her to potentially lose votes. The great thing too is she's got this rapid response team of media matters. They are like any human shield around her and it's suggested that you can't defend herself, no matter what. It's like a giant entourage around a weak boxer, and but -- they are not gonna be able to get in the ring with her. When she gets in the ring, John Podesta is not gonna be there. David Brock is not gonna be there, and they are worried. They are worried that during a debate, she's not, she's gonna crumble. She's gonna topple.BOLLING: She won't have the media matters prophylactic (ph) shield--GUTFELD: Exactly.BOLLING: That's right.GUILFOYLE: That sounds it really --GUTFELD: The scandal condom.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Heard it, they way you said it. It's --PAVLICH: Wow.GUILFOYLE: Hand sanitizer. All right, so but now, to try to clean it all up, Hillary Clinton's team, they put together this memo and they are trying to counterbalance this Clinton cash -- you know these attacks against her. What's do you say Katie?PAVLICH: Well, the Clinton team is going to do two things. The first thing they are gonna do, you know, according to the Clinton history is they are gonna attack Peter Schweizer, the author, personally. That is their playbook. They haven't done it yet, but they will absolutely start doing that. The second thing that's outlined in this memo that Ed Henry was reporting on is basically, they are going to say this is public information, there's no news here, that we're moving forward, that it's old news and that there's no scandal here and that Peter Schweizer, the author, is simply working for the Koch brothers where we heard that before, he's a right-wing operative. But the bottom line is this, just because someone has political motivations or because they have a political point of view, doesn't make allegations false. And I'm wondering if the Clinton administration - or the Clinton campaign is gonna up to the Washington Post, The New York Times which it said Schweizer's reporting is -- fair, and if they are gonna go up to Fox News and say, no, they will. But they are gonna go after this other media outlets as well, to get their point across about making this non- credible. And so, those are going to be the two outlines. Remember the guy who said Benghazi was like two years ago doomed (ph) (inaudible), well he is now working for the Clinton campaign.GUILFOYLE: Of course.PAVLICH: And he's now using this strategy that he was using in the Obama White House now, and the campaign saying, this is old news, let's move forward.GUILFOYLE: OK.PAVLICH: If you're publicly available.GUILFOYLE: So the (inaudible). So what do you think? The problems with the Clintons or what?WILLIAMS: Yeah. I mean look, what you just heard Katie say, the real news here is that The New York Times, The Washington Post in addition to Fox news are gonna do specials, outtakes of this book. And I think that adds credibility to it. I know that really screws up this table because, oh my guy, Washington Post and New York Times is going after Hillary Clinton --BOLLING: In progress.WILLIAMS: I know, you're upset, you calm dawn. It's OK.GUTFELD: They want something more liberal?WILLIAMS: No. I think that what we're in here is a season of, you've got to prove that you have some credibility with regard to Clinton and not be seen as -- you know, having your hand up the back of her dress.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Somebody that they with Obama. WILLIAMS: Yeah, no. Well, that's right. Because the argument is you've been too kind to Obama that you had been a course and they are not going to do that with Clinton. But I think with Clinton there's a lot of backdrop here. There are questions, for example about, the e-mails. There are questions about why the foundation was taking money from foreign governments and even how they have dealt with that. I will say this. I've been looking as a journalist for the quid pro quo to prove that Clinton did something wrong.BOLLING: The progress poll, yesterday.WILLIAMS: Well, tell me, tell me babe (ph).BOLLING: 200 -- I'm sorry, they dropped $100 million on the Clinton foundation. That very week, that Hillary Clinton declared that she was running for president and that was -- that same group, it's called the Lundin group. That same group was under investigation for human rights violations in the Congo, which was brought up by Hillary Clinton and Senator Obama when they were senators to go after companies like the Lundin group.WILLIAMS: Yeah, but --BOLLING: In progress, thank you --WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, wait, so if you are saying that she then didn't, didn't --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: Didn't prosecute, right? --WILLIAMS: I don't think -- I don't think that --BOLLING: That's -- I didn't safe (ph).WILLIAMS: No. But I'm saying this, the ones that I heard about is, there was a free trade agreement between the U.S. and Colombia while she was getting money.BOLLING: Sure. That's another one.WILLIAMS: From the foundation somebody in Columbia, or one of her donors.BOLLING: That's another one.WILLIAMS: I don't see this as convicting her of something in the voters' mind.GUILFOYLE: I don't know, but to take away from that blog, what he is saying to Bolling -- tell me babe.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: OK. When The Five returns, it was babe. We'll show you how far one woman just went to keep up with the Kardashians. The story behind this red carpet photo, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back, time for -- The Fastest 7 minutes on television. iPhone, iPad, android, via Fox go app. Three campy story, seven crisp minutes, one quotient host. First stop, one of America's most respected surgeons, Dr. Oz, has come under fire lately from a group of doctors who seem to be jealous for his TV success. They are calling for him to be removed from the prestigious Columbia University Board of Surgeons where he is Vice Chairman Dr. Oz has this response for his critics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. MEHMET OZ, HOST, THE DR. OZ SHOW: I know I've irritated some potential allies in our quest to make America healthy. No matter our disagreements, freedom of speech is the most fundamental right we have as Americans. And these 10 doctors are trying to silence that right. So I vowed to you right here, right now, we will not be silenced, we will not give in.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: OK. We'll bring it around, K.G., your thoughts on Dr. Oz's --GUILFOYLE: I'm --BOLLING: Or the doctors that are calling for him to be removed.GUILFOYLE: OK. You know, I can't go into their hearts and minds as to -- he's actually the motivation, perhaps some of it is. Some professional, you know jealousy, they certainly kind of banded this together against him. I do know that he was a very well respected. A very good cardiothoracic surgeon which is - you know passed that specialty to masters so, he has to know something and you know, Oprah likes him.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: That's enough for me.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Greg, Columbia, vice chairman of the surgical division, cardiothoracic surgeon -- the man is good.GUTFELD: Yes. When I was there, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, I -- we had lunch a lot. Look, OK, this is the only issue that I might have with him.You have to think about your customers or your viewers. As long as there are supplements, there are people that will buy them and people who will sell them, despite whether there's any scientific backup. People will always be interested in them.But when you're -- when you have a TV show or when you are running a magazine, you have to remember that your audience isn't rich. They're not made of money. And they listen to you, so they go out, and they spend money on biotin or chromium. They'll go and they spend money when they should be spending money on their grandkids or going on a vacation.And that's the only thing that bothers me about health gurus. Is that at times, they take advantage of viewers who do not have the adequate knowledge, which is their own fault...GUILFOYLE: But biotin works.GUTFELD: No, it doesn't!PERINO: What's wrong with you?GUILFOYLE: Look at this hair, baby.GUTFELD: Biotin is for your fingernails.GUILFOYLE: No, it's fingernails and hair.GUTFELD: This is my point. This is a placebo effect, America.GUILFOYLE: You're not.GUTFELD: You're watching the placebo effect.GUILFOYLE: One pill a day. One pill a day, people, it will change your life.BOLLING: I'm going to agree with Greg on this.Katie.GUILFOYLE: What?BOLLING: Do you agree with doctors or Dr. Oz?PAVLICH: You know, his show is so popular. He is popular. I'm kind of tired of people calling for other people getting fired, especially on television, when they say or do something that other people disagree with. So I think he should stand his ground, which he seems to be doing.BOLLING: Juanito, babe.GUILFOYLE: Babe. Babe, hit me.WILLIAMS: You know, well, let me tell you, sweetheart. I've got to tell you that, you know, when he's -- proposes some of these diet remedies, and then the company goes and settles with the Federal Trade Commission, because they can't prove that their product says [SIC] what they were advertised, it makes people question.So it says here in my notes that Newsweek did a study, and they found 44 percent of the time, the things that Dr. Oz recommends are, in fact, really good and they produce...BOLLING: Forty percent?WILLIAMS: Forty-four percent of the time.GUTFELD: So that leaves 56 percent.WILLIAMS: That's right. You know, 39 percent of the time, researchers found no evidence.GUILFOYLE: All the dermatologists stand by biotin.WILLIAMS: You're back there?GUILFOYLE: Look at me.BOLLING: Anyway, your hair is beautiful.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: We give you a (UNINTELLIGIBLE)GUILFOYLE: You know, it's very good.BOLLING: All right.GUILFOYLE: Look at these eyebrows.BOLLING: Kimye -- Kimye, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, are royalty in Hollywood. Comedian Amy Schumer proved it last night at the TIME 100 red carpet. Schumer took a dive, prostrating herself in front of Kim and ""Yeezus."" They sidestepped her, offering no help.Schumer called the prank to call attention to homelessness. Just kidding. Season three of her comedy show premiered last night, Gregory.GUTFELD: She was doing an imitation of TIME magazine.You know, I think -- I think she was trying to steal the thunder of America's sweetheart, Kanye. And I thought it was offensive. That's why I don't do red carpets. I skip the Oscars, Grammys, Tonys. I have Taylor Swift accept all my awards.BOLLING: Now Katie, if -- if you...GUILFOYLE: Look at Kanye's face. He's so not happy.BOLLING: If that happened to you, you would definitely help Amy Schumer, wouldn't you?PAVLICH: I certainly would, and I would get her hairstylists to fix her hair, because she definitely just ruined hours' worth of work for her red carpet appearance, doing that. It wasn't worth it.BOLLING: What do you think, Juan?WILLIAMS: It's a total stunt. It's a stunt to get attention for her, for her new show; and I mean, it's crass in that sense, but it's TV crass. I mean, that's what some people...GUTFELD: This is not a sophisticated show, Juan. Not like ""The Five.""WILLIAMS: I know. Exactly. We would never do that.BOLLING: I love how they look down; they just kept walking.GUILFOYLE: No, they just -- they're, like, annoyed. And yes, Yeezus was like, what? Like that. He looked like he was going to, like, push her a little bit with the boot. I don't understand. It's pretty funny.GUTFELD: She's a funny gal.GUILFOYLE: But she should get her roots done (ph).GUTFELD: Barrel of laughs.BOLLING: All right. How about this one? Finally, what's the grossest thing you've ever eaten? Ever eat a worm from a bottle of mescal tequila? I have. Not bad. Tastes like chicken.GUILFOYLE: Blanco gordito.BOLLING: Blanco gordito. Actually, there's no flavor at all.Here's actress Salma Hayek eating a cricket for Instagram followers. Or as she says, crickets are the future snacks for kids. No, really.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SALMA HAYEK, ACTRESS: These are crickets from Mexico, form Oaxaca.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Is that dead?BOLLING: Who cares?GUILFOYLE: Well, I care. I mean, it sounds like it could be.BOLLING: Does it matter if it was alive or dead?GUILFOYLE: I don't know. A little bit. Because maybe it's more of a potato chip.BOLLING: Would you eat it if it were dead?GUILFOYLE: If I could save someone's life or cure cancer, I'd eat it every day.BOLLING: Well, it's not curing cancer.GUILFOYLE: OK. Well, then no.GUTFELD: OK. Who speaks up for this insect? It has a beating heart. Where's PETI?GUILFOYLE: I think it's dead.GUTFELD: People for the Ethical Treatment of Insects? Imagine the journey that that poor little cricket just took. We had a candlelight -- we had a candlelight vigil at the end, waiting for it to come out.And?GUTFELD: It wasn't pretty.BOLLING: Angelina Jolie has also...WILLIAMS: You were there. You were watching.BOLLING: ... pointed out the nutritional value of insects, a.k.a. a cricket.PAVLICH: In a civilized world, we should not be eating insects. That's my opinion.WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.PAVLICH: Let's not.WILLIAMS: Let me tell you, I was in China and what they do, you know, on special occasions, they give you scorpion, fried scorpion. And actually...BOLLING: Did you eat it?WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: What else? Is that the grossest thing you've ever eaten?WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. I mean, I eat a lot of crap around here, if that's what you're...GUILFOYLE: Yes, yes, totally. I've probably eaten a lot of gross stuff. But I mean, I've also eaten things that people eat, maybe people don't like. Escargot.BOLLING: You have no idea some of the grossest stuff you've ever eaten.GUILFOYLE: People don't like that.BOLLING: Restaurants?GUILFOYLE: Foie gras. Tripe.WILLIAMS: What about -- what about...GUILFOYLE: Stomach lining. I eat that.WILLIAMS: Yes, you mean, in Latin food, you know, like tripe is a big deal.GUTFELD: I've eaten -- believe it or not, I've eaten a lot of reindeer.GUILFOYLE: Oh, please.GUTFELD: Yes, I do. I love Rudolph.GUILFOYLE: What are you talking about?GUTFELD: I've eaten it.BOLLING: You've had the mescal worm?GUTFELD: The worst tasting food I've ever had was puffin. You ever see a puffin? It's an adorable little bird. It takes like -- it tastes like shoelaces made of licorice.GUILFOYLE: Is it better than quail? I've had quail before.GUTFELD: Really? What about the bird?GUILFOYLE: Oh, Jesus.BOLLING: OK. We need to go.GUILFOYLE: I don't do blonde men.BOLLING: Ahead, presidential candidate Ted Cruz shows off his skills at a shooting range in New Hampshire. Guns in 2016, next on ""The Five.""GUILFOYLE: What's wrong with you?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAVLICH: All right. Well, how big of an issue will guns be for voters in the upcoming presidential election? One candidate, vowing to protect our Second Amendment rights, hit the firing range in New Hampshire this weekend.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(GUNFIRE)(END VIDEO CLIP)PAVLICH: Very nice AK-47.And there's been a huge shift in public opinion about guns in America recently. More than half the country now believes it's important -- more important to protect gun rights, rather than control gun ownership.Now, Greg...GUTFELD: Yes.PAVLICH: ... this Pew poll that came out also shows that 57 percent of Americans believe that gun ownership is a way to prevent themselves from being a victim of crime.GUTFELD: Yes. I have to point out that the shooting guns is the right- wing equivalent of Hillary talking about toppling the 1 percent. It's almost the mirror image of appealing to a very conservative base, which I don't have a problem with. Because the gun issue is one area where facts - - one of the rare areas where facts and commonsense have prevailed over emotionalism and hysteria.For example, I don't think you can name a place on this planet where gun bans or gun regulations have reduced murder rates. I don't think there's one place on effort.You can compare countries and say England has fewer murders, but they actually had fewer murders before they had the regulation. So you have to compare murder rates before and after bans and regulation. You can't compare country to country.But every single -- every single area where you look at statistic, legal gun ownership always prevails over the emotionalism of the gun control movement.WILLIAMS: Just give me more on that. Do you mean to say that in Japan and England, where they have bans, greater gun control and much fewer deaths, you're saying you can't compare that to the United States?GUTFELD: No, you can't. They're -- as far as I can tell, and I've looked and I've talked to experts, you cannot find a place in the world where a gun ban has reduced the murder rates before and after.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: If I'm wrong, send me the information.WILLIAMS: Gregory, today...GUILFOYLE: You said that, and no one has sent it.WILLIAMS: Today this is a different era. When you have these high-powered assault weapons that are available, and they create things like what happened in Columbine, what happened Connecticut.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: And Newtown.GUTFELD: And those aren't on the increase. They aren't.PAVLICH: Juan, the fact is that, according to the Department of Homeland Security, the vast majority of school shootings and mass shootings actually are carried out with a handgun, not a sporting rifle or what you call an assault weapon.But Kimberly...GUILFOYLE: Yes.PAVLICH: ... a lot of the candidates have been talking about this issue. A lot of them went to the NRA convention. The one person who wasn't invited, who has a different stance, is Chris Christie.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PAVLICH: Because he believes in a lot of the gun control that the left has been pushing.GUILFOYLE: Yes, he's not going to be the candidate or the nominee. He's out.PAVLICH: Just because of this issue?GUILFOYLE: You know, for that issue and others. I just -- I think that is significant, especially when you see the polling and the shifting with respect to the American people being more vocal about this issue, understanding the laws about guns, understanding the facts about guns, and not bending to the hysteria.Guns don't walk into a theater by themselves and shoot people. You have to look at who's behind it, who's behind the trigger? So when you try and keep guns out of the hands of lawful, law-abiding Americans, who are you serving? Who are you helping? Right?So Chris Christie, I'm not sure why he's going in that direction and pivoting. I don't think it's going to help him politically.PAVLICH: Yes, well, Eric, statistics show that the No. 1 reason why people buy their first handgun is for self-defense. And to me that indicates that gun ownership is becoming much more personal: ""I want to defend my family, so don't take away that right.""Do you think that's something that...BOLLING: I think -- and the numbers are bearing out. It's just interesting that Pew poll shows history, and it's for very -- by far the widest it's been, where people think that gun ownership is more important than more gun control. It has skewed a little bit -- it has touched a few times, and now it's widened; it's been in the favor of gun ownership.Chris Christie has been on -- has been anti-gun since day one. He -- I think it will be his Achilles heel. I'm not sure Ted Cruz is doing this for Chris Christie or just to kind of fire up his right-wing base.GUILFOYLE: But he shoots and his wife shoots.BOLLING: Well, who?GUILFOYLE: Ted Cruz.BOLLING: No, I'm in favor. I'm glad he's doing it.GUILFOYLE: Right. But I think he's doing it because that's who he is.BOLLING: Can I just throw something out here?GUILFOYLE: Juan.WILLIAMS: Oh, please.BOLLING: Have you seen what John McCain has done to Ted Cruz and the aftermath? Like Ted Cruz proposed allowing military people to hold -- what? -- to carry on military bases, and for some reason, John McCain is giving him a hard time. I just hate what's going on in the right wing.PAVLICH: Well, Juan.WILLIAMS: You know, let me just quickly say, this conversation just so riles me up. You know, it's just so crazy. Even the numbers indicate -- as Katie was saying, the reason that the numbers are going up, it says no gun control, is people say, ""I want to be personally safe against crime."" Crime is at a 20-year low, except the statistics say a majority of Americans, 60 plus percent in Gallup, think that crime is on the rise.This is all fabricated. This is all...GUILFOYLE: What does that have to do with guns?WILLIAMS: You talk about frenzy and hysteria, that's what's going on, led by the NRA to get the gun ownership rights so you can take guns everywhere.BOLLING: Do you think -- do you think crime is at a 20-year low...GUILFOYLE: Juan's scared of the bogeyman.BOLLING: ... because gun ownership is at a 20-year high?WILLIAMS: No, think...BOLLING: I do.WILLIAMS: No, I'm going to tell you some other part of this. I think that white America...GUILFOYLE: Oh!BOLLING: Oh!WILLIAMS: It says it right here. I don't have to make this up. You say, ""Oh, the black guy on the panel said this."" But look, here's what Pew says. Support for gun control has dropped among whites who see crime on the rise when, in fact, crime is falling.GUTFELD: But also, gun use among blacks is on the rise, too. They're looking upon it as favorable.WILLIAMS: More so. More so than ever.GUTFELD: Yes. There are three -- there are three points. Right? Crime drops where gun laws are relaxed for citizens, not criminals. No. 2, felons are less likely to target anyplace that is armed.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: They've done surveys on that.GUILFOYLE: Correct.GUTFELD: Three, killers and terrorist target gun-free zones. Those are facts.PAVLICH: We've got to go.WILLIAMS: Most likely to get shot, you and me by our wives.PAVLICH: We've got to go.All right. All right.GUILFOYLE: Speak for yourself!PAVLICH: Ben Affleck didn't want the world to know he had an ancestor who owned slaves, and PBS helped keep his secret. Did the network violate its own ethical standards by doing so? Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Actor Ben Affleck learned a lot about his family's history on the show ""Finding Your Roots.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEN AFFLECK, ACTOR: So this means he enlisted in the Revolutionary Army in 1776?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's right. Your sixth great-grandfather volunteered to serve in the patriot army.AFFLECK: Wow.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He fought, Ben in the American Revolution.AFFLECK: Wow, that is incredible.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: But one thing he learned did not air on the program, because he asked PBS to cut it out. Ben had an ancestor who owned slaves. He admitted making the request for the omission, saying, quote, ""I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth,"" end quote. He now says he regrets asking.PBS is conducting an internal review.So how big of a credibility problem is it for the network, PBS, to have accommodated this request? Now, Affleck says, ""Remember, this isn't a news show; it's a documentary. I volunteered to participate.""But to me, I think PBS has a big problem here.GUTFELD: Looking at me?WILLIAMS: Sure, why not?GUTFELD: I was on that show a couple months ago. I found out my dad was Lou Dobbs. Yes -- no.As much as I find...GUILFOYLE: Everyone has been talking about it.GUTFELD: We do look like.BOLLING: Lou talks about it.GUILFOYLE: Lou's proud.GUTFELD: As much as I find Ben Affleck pretentious and PBS tedious, the real evil here is WikiLeaks. They're leaking information.WILLIAMS: Oh, man, that's true.GUTFELD: We could take -- we can talk about the story and take pleasure out of Affleck getting screwed.GUILFOYLE: I don't.GUTFELD: But this is going to happen to us. It's a matter of time. I'm telling you. And that's why I believe in karma. I feel bad for Affleck; I feel bad for PBS. I think that WikiLeaks -- no one can do it to WikiLeaks, because they've got -- there's nothing interesting about them. There's nothing to leak.PAVLICH: Well, I am actually a daughter of the American Revolution, as well. James Forbush (ph) in Massachusetts was a drummer in the American Revolution.GUTFELD: Good for you.PAVLICH: So I won't have that left out if PBS ever allows me to participate. But I think the question, Juan, is what else are they leaving out of the programming? So if they'll do it for Affleck, will they do it for everything?WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think -- I think he's a celebrity -- Eric.BOLLING: I think what they failed to -- what they also took out was that, in addition to Ben Affleck's great-grandfather, Brian Williams was there with him.WILLIAMS: And Madame.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: What do you think of this? You know, I'm thinking is it a case that, because you're embarrassed about your family owning slaves, you just wipe out the history? Is this something in the American mind we don't want to think about this?GUILFOYLE: Yes, I mean, look...GUTFELD: He's a liberal, Juan.GUILFOYLE: Yes, but you know, I mean -- I like Ben Affleck. I think he's a nice guy, and you know, this is an unfortunate situation. I think he probably was very personally embarrassed and ashamed by it. The question is should PBS have...WILLIAMS: But Greg raises a quick point. He's a liberal. Do you think that's why he was embarrassed?GUILFOYLE: I don't know.WILLIAMS: Anyway, ""One More Thing"" coming at you.GUILFOYLE: I mean, would you want that out -- coming out about you?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: It's ""Juan More Thing"" -- Juan.WILLIAMS: That's the one I got kidded about. Anyway, a gang member in Tennessee was in court for shooting a rival, and all of a sudden, the judge, Lila Tatum (ph), got tough here. And here's her response.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sir, East Lake Courts is not your hood. It's the citizens of the United States who own that, because they work and they pay taxes. You don't own that. People like you have made it a violent, unsafe place to live. I don't think you want to say a word to me, Mr. Smith.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: He shouldn't. You know what? He shot somebody because that guy came into what he called his hood and violated his turf. And hats off to Judge Tatum (ph) for telling him that hood belongs to the people of this country and not to that thug.GUTFELD: All right.K.G.GUILFOYLE: OK, I have a nice one.GUTFELD: Aww.GUILFOYLE: Thank you. Involving Sandra Bullock, the original America's sweetheart. And she is People magazine's 2015 World's Most Beautiful Woman. I think she's a wonderful person, great mom, adopted a beautiful boy, inside and out. And she said, ""Real beauty is quiet, especially in this town. It's just so hard not to say OK, I need to look like that.""She has a very good idea of beauty from the inside out, so she is to be commended.GUTFELD: I'll tell her you said that when I get home.GUILFOYLE: Yes, right. You wish.GUTFELD: Eric.BOLLING: Going to e-mail her?GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: First time in 84 years, a Naval Academy graduate is going to be a big league pro ball player. St. Louis Cardinals brought up this guy right here, Mitch Harris, 29-year-old relief pitcher. Harris deployed three different times, made second lieutenant. There's a game tonight. Hopefully, he gets to throw a ball in a Major League game. But first time in 84 years. Good luck, son.GUTFELD: Excellent. All right. Katie?PAVLICH: You know what I hate? When your dog steals your tractor.GUTFELD: No.PAVLICH: Look at this dog who stole this old - nice old man, 77's, tractor. He drove it, on accident, because the controls went into auto mode across a motorway. And then it crashed. But everyone was OK. And it ended up being fine, and the dog is OK. But watch your animals.GUTFELD: So -- so Dana is out, and you still felt compelled to do a dog ""One More Thing.""PAVLICH: Yes. I have to, you know, make sure it's done.GUTFELD: We could have had one break. One break.All right. You know who...GUILFOYLE: He hates guns and tractors.PAVLICH: Tractors and dogs.BOLLING: Sitting in for Dana. Big shoes.GUTFELD: That is true.GUILFOYLE: She's got boots on, baby.GUTFELD: You know who's pretty in pink?GUILFOYLE: Who?GUTFELD: Bill Clinton. Check out. Check this out: He's got new pink trainers or sneakers. And I'm telling you, this guy is going to be an amazing first dude. He's our own hot-tub time machine. He's going to bring some serious partying back to the White House. Look at those shoes, in public.WILLIAMS: That's how he gets girl, man.GUILFOYLE: It's very good.WILLIAMS: I bet Sandra Bullock would go out with him.GUILFOYLE: At least he's being healthy, and he's walking and exercising.GUTFELD: You're so positive.GUILFOYLE: I am so positive. When you take biotin, you are just full of life and energy.GUTFELD: Go away. Go away. ""Special Report"" is next.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/01/12/rep-trey-gowdy-almost-anything-is-fair-in-politics/	Rep. Trey Gowdy: Almost anything is fair in politics	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" January 12, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: We have got Congressman Trey Gowdy with us right now.  He's a big backer of Marco Rubio.Yet, Congressman, I don't believe the senator is going to be in the well of the House tonight for the president's remarks. Does that bother you at any level?  REP. TREY GOWDY, R-S.C.: Well, the last I heard, he was going to be there for the State of the Union.But I can assure you, Neil, it won't bother me either way.CAVUTO: OK. Good. Then I'm wrong. OK. I'm sorry.GOWDY: No, no, no, no, no. I'm more likely to be wrong. But it won't bother me whether he's there or not.CAVUTO: No, I will go with you.All right, so you have known the dust-up this has created with the senator about missed votes and all that. This happened to Senator Obama. They didn't make nearly the extent of it when he was running for president and missed far more votes, John Kennedy, to, when he was running as the senator for president in 1960.Be that as it may, some of his Republican rivals are champing at the bit to point that out. What do you make of that?GOWDY: Well, I think almost anything is fair in politics. That's what I have learned. I think Marco would tell you he is running to make those votes consequential.I think one of the criticisms that is unfair, Neil, would be the intelligence briefings that Governor Bush says he's missed. You read -- you learn more watching your show or reading The New York Times than you do going to these so-called intelligence briefings.Marco is on Senate Intel. So, he knows the state of the world better than any of his Senate colleagues who are not on Senate Intel and certainly better than the other candidates. So, the fact that he may missed some pomp and circumstance public meeting, where none of us learn anything, doesn't bother me at all.CAVUTO: All right. And, by the way, you are correct, and I was wrong, Congressman. The senator will be there.Senator Cruz will not be there. Now, maybe there's where the confusion -- sir, I apologize.Senator Cruz has recently been coming under fire here as to whether he's a natural-born American citizen. He is considered an American citizen because his American mother gave birth to him in Canada. But you know the drill. By his definition and maybe others, he's a citizen.Donald Trump had his doubts. We're going to relay that later on in a conversation I had with Mr. Trump. Do you have any concerns? Many in your party have said, well, this is a legitimate issue. Do you think it's a legitimate issue?GOWDY: It may have been a legitimate issue 100 years ago when the Supreme Court weighed in on it, but, me, it is settled law, to the extent anything can be settled by the Supreme Court.If you are the child of an American citizen, regardless of where you're born, you're an American citizen. And his mother was an American citizen.  I didn't think it was much of an issue with the president when people raised it eight years ago. I don't think it's an issue now.CAVUTO: OK, so, when you look at this race and how it's going, I know you support Senator Rubio, but all the polls continue, and many would tell you surprisingly so, that Donald Trump is on top.I will ask you what I have asked a number of other powerful Republicans and influential figures in the party. Could you back Donald Trump if he were indeed your party's nominee for president?GOWDY: Oh, absolutely.I'm going to vote for the Republican nominee. I'm going to work for the Republican nominee, because anyone on our side is better than anyone on their side. And if I have learned anything in the last five years, Neil, I have learned that if you want to the fundamentally change the direction of the country, you have to have the executive branch, you have to have the White House.So, I am going to work, to the extent they will have me, and do everything I can to elect the Republican, no matter who he or she is.CAVUTO: All right, Congressman, thank you very much. Good seeing you.GOWDY: Yes, sir. You, too. Thank you.CAVUTO: From the fine state of South Carolina. It is beautiful here in Charleston, Congressman, as you know quite well. Thank you very, very much. All right.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
