Don't let bumper stickers mar your car. Yank political yard signs out of the lawn. These days you can proclaim your political preference by the dozen. This is year of the political cookie, the cookie with a message: ""Stay Poor. Vote Democrat,"" sugar cookies, or ""Protect Medicare Now"" shortbreads. Several bakers across the nation have blended their baking and politics by creating deciduous treats that whet appetites and stir debates. Marla Romash was a TV and print reporter and Al Gore 2000 press secretary before she turned her political passion into baking.  After taking a break from politics, Romash, who lives in Maryland, decided to attend culinary school, but didn't think about political cookies until some business associates asked why, as executive pastry chef at Marla's Magic and Dreamz Catering company, she never combined the two.  That got her to thinking, and last year, the Political Cookie Company was born that specializes in custom made, hand-decorated sugar cookies. There are ""Keep Left"" and ""I Miss Bill and Al"" as well as ""Red States Rock"" and ""You Can't Blame Bush Anymore."" ""I do both sides,"" says Romash, ""but I want to be very clear. I am a die-hard Democrat.""In addition to Romney and Obama, Romash reflects the political zeitgeist with shortbreads depicting Sarah Palin, John Boehner, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Ron Paul, Nancy Pelosi, and Hillary Clinton, among others. Many feature familiar caricatures commissioned from Hartford Courant political cartoonist, Bob Englehard. While Romash still works in politics and indulges her savory side at her Dreamz Catering company, pastry she says, where she belongs.St. Louis-based Melodee Lang also switched careers, from Certified Public Accountant to baker, doing both for more than 20 years. ""I was a single-mom who had to get two sons through college so I needed a second job,"" she explains. After years of gifting clients with baked goods, Lang opened her online bakery, The Elegant Cookie, which also specializes in gift baskets. ""I never thought I'd ever read countless books on 'search-engine optimization,'"" she laughs. She also never thought she'd open a brick-and-mortar bakery but she did, just two months ago. ""The upside of a down-economy,"" she says, ""is great deals on retail space.""Lang's cookies and donuts are all photorealism and buttercream. Edible-ink cartridges by Kopycakes (for Canon and Epson printers) let her download Obama and Romney images, which she got from each campaign, onto edible frosting sheets. ""It's kind of like rice paper,"" she explains.She floats the images onto her soft, chewy, sugar-butter cookies and Krispy Kreme-type donuts, both frosted with her ""proprietary buttercream variant"" (that's the CPA talking.) The paper literally melts away leaving just the image.Twenty two-year-old Texas State University student and online bakery owner Hayley Callaway's ""Patriotic"" line includes beautifully decorated ""Stop The Obamanation: Vote For Anyone Else"" sugar cookies as well as ""Democrats: Change That Matters"" ones. That being said, Callaway is Romney all-the-way and says she's ""proud"" of his debate performance.""Anything you can do on paper,"" she says, ""you can do on cookie."" Royal icing is her ""paint"" or ""ink"" and cookies are her canvas. Royal icing, a mixture of confectioner's sugar, egg whites, or meringue powder, and vanilla, which you can thicken or thin, color or flavor is a cookie baking staple. Her Aviation and Army Pilot Line Art cookies, part of her ""Patriotic"" line, showcase her expertise in baking and a self-professed lifelong obsession with doodling.She started HayleyCakes and Cookies as a college sophomore to make money for an additional Music Ministry degree. The music school folded but the cookie website took off. These days Callaway's mom, a home economics teacher, travels up from Houston to help with big orders and Callaway's newly-minted fiance handles deliveries. She hopes to open a bakery when she graduates.Callaway plans on watching the upcoming debates. Not just to cheer Romney on, but because, the college senior explains, ""we get extra credit for watching."""	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]

Mike McCaul rips Iran prisoner swap as 'bad deal'	"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" January 18, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SEAN HANNITY, HOST (voice-over): Tonight...PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This is a good day.HANNITY: Republicans slam President Obama's prisoner swap with Iran.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This deal is a really problematic deal.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's put a price on the head of every American abroad.GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This president lives in his own world.HANNITY: House Homeland Security chairman Mike McCaul and former defense secretary Robert Gates are here tonight with reaction.Then, with two weeks to go until Iowa, Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz unleash attacks on each other.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's a nasty guy. Nobody likes him. Nobody in Congress likes him.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: For whatever reason, Donald doesn't react when he's going down in the polls.HANNITY: Our political panel weighs in.And Hillary Clinton relentlessly defends President Obama's policies at last night's Democratic debate.HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama.HANNITY: ""Hannity"" starts right here, right now.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, Iran continues to take advantage of President Obama at the negotiating table. Over the weekend, the White House announced the release of five Americans being held in Iran. Now, that included Pastor Saeed Abedini, former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati and Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. But in exchange, the administration agreed to release seven Iranians in U.S. custody and remove 14 others from an Interpol wanted list.Now, while we're obviously happy to get our Americans back, Iran got the better end of the deal, and President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry -- well, they're giving themselves a big pat on the back. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: This is a good day because once again, we're seeing what's possible with strong American diplomacy.I gave these families my word, I made a vow, that we would do everything in our power to win the release of their loved ones. And we have been tireless. On the sidelines of the nuclear negotiations, our diplomats at the highest level, including Secretary Kerry, used every meeting to push Iran to release our Americans. I did so myself in my conversation with President Rouhani.SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY: We feel very comfortable that the United States of America held onto its principles, got its people home, kept faith with them. And so the question is, if you're going to get them out, there had to be some component of exchange. And what we gave up, we believe, were people who were about to get out anyway and people that we couldn't get our hands on. So I just don't agree. I think there is a rectitude in what we achieved.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, on top of all of that, as part of the Iran nuclear deal, the rogue regime in Tehran will be getting access of up to $150 billion in frozen assets. My next guest says this will just help Iran bankroll terrorism. Joining us now, the author of ""Failures of Imagination,"" the House Homeland Security chairman, Congressman Mike McCaul.Congressman, you said this will bankroll terrorism. I agree with you because during negotiations, the Iranians were burning our flag, burning the Israeli flag. They said the destruction of Israel is nonnegotiable, and their leaders were chanting ""Death to America.""Why did the president make this deal? And what did we get out of it, if anything?REP. MIKE MCCAUL, R-TEXAS: Well, the ayatollah said this will not change his policy towards the arrogant United States of America. I don't think we got a lot out of this deal. I'm glad the hostages came home, but the fact is, we released seven criminals in exchange for American hostages, and 14 at large, two of whom may have been responsible for the Jewish bombing down in Argentina many years ago. And as you mention $150 billion of frozen assets now freed up to go to the largest state sponsor of terror.Sean, what I -- what worries me the most, $150 billion going into that country when we know they have active operations not only throughout the Middle East, where they've killed hundreds of American soldiers, but also in the Western hemisphere, which is one of the chapters of my book.HANNITY: Yes. You know, they not only get the $150 billion, they still continue to spin their centrifuges. They've been able to partner now with Vladimir Putin for missile defense, if the Israelis or the Americans need to take out -- if we need to take out their nuclear sites, 24-days notice for inspections. They're not even American inspectors. And in some cases, I understand they get to pick some of the inspectors.Do you think that one day, this has the potential, radical Islamic mullahs of Iran coupled with nuclear weapons -- am I wrong in saying one and one is two, that that could be a modern-day Holocaust?MCCAUL: I think it's a real threat to the security of the United States of America. One of the chapters outlined in my book talks about the Iranian influence with Venezuela, these aero (ph) terror flights that go back and forth that we don't manifests on, and then nuclear material smuggled across our unsecure southwest border from Mexico into the United States.So that very much concerns me. Also, as you mention, the ability to verify or inspect these facilities in Iran is very much up in the air.Look, this is a bad deal. And they're already firing missiles in defiance of the international law.HANNITY: And of course, they took Americans prisoner for...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... 24 hours., American sailors, and had their hands behind their back. Congressman, keep up the good work. Thank you.Now, 2016 Republican presidential candidates were very quick to point out that this so-called prisoner swap with Iran was not a good deal, and of course, could have very dangerous consequences. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)TRUMP: They should have come back as part of the deal three years ago, when they started talking about the deal, not now. Not now.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CRUZ: It reflects a pattern we've seen in the Obama administration over and over again of negotiating with terrorists and making deals and trades that endanger U.S. safety and security.CHRISTIE: I don't know how many more times these folks had to kick him before he realizes he's being kicked. The Iranians have treated him with such enormous disrespect.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's put a price on the head of every American abroad. Our enemies now know that if you can capture an American, you can get something meaningful in exchange for it!(END VIDEO CLIPS)HANNITY: Here with reaction is the distinguished chair of military theory at Marine Corps University. Dr. Sebastian Gorka is with us. Doctor, good to see you. Let's go to Marco Rubio's comment. Did we now send a message to the world, take an Americans hostage and you're going to get what you want?SEBASTIAN GORKA, MARINE CORPS UNIVERSITY: Absolutely, Sean. We gave away the farm for a Starbucks gift card. We sent a very clear message that this nation, which is the greatest state sponsor of terrorism for the last 30 years, has carte blanche. We've removed the red warning, the Interpol red warning, on 14 people who are probably guilty of one of the biggest terror attacks in recent years.Think about the fact that we had hundreds of Marines that were killed in Beirut by an organization trained by the IRGC. In Iraq, our servicemen were maimed, were killed by IEDs that were empowered by Quds Force, Republican Guard assistance to the local militias. We've sent a message -- Iran, you can get away with murder, literally, Sean.HANNITY: You know, it's really frightening. Now, I'm happy that Pastor Abedini -- I know that Jay Sekulow with the American Center for Law and Justice for many years has worked for the release of this pastor. I've interviewed the pastor's wife and family. So I'm happy about that. But as a result, are we going to have more hostages taken?GORKA: Look, this -- this -- the math of this is not just what this is all about. So we're doing the figures, four for seven, seven for 21. All this math is beside the point. This isn't like a spy swap on a bridge somewhere in East Berlin during the cold war. We're exchanging people who were arrested and put in prison for their beliefs, like the pastor, for individuals who are terrorists or spies.That's not a straight deal. That is empowering the message of the theocratic regime of the mullahs, and they will draw the right conclusions that we are no longer a leader and we're giving into their message of terror.HANNITY: Dr. Gorka, I agree with you, sadly. Thank you for being with us.Also here with reaction, author of the brand-new book ""A Passion for Leadership: Lessons on Change and Reform From 50 Years of Public Service,"" former secretary of defense Robert Gates is with us.Mr. Secretary, it's an honor to have you. How are you? Good to see you again.ROBERT GATES, FMR. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Thank you.HANNITY: You said the U.S. got out-negotiated on the Iran deal originally. You seemed to back off it, though, in a recent interview.GATES: Well, I think that -- I think they did get out-negotiated. For example, we -- the administration said as late as April, last April, that they had to have anywhere, anytime inspections, and yet that was given up. We insisted for a long time on getting the history of the Iranian nuclear weaponization research program, and we didn't get that. So I think that there were some -- I think it's clear that we wanted the agreement more than the Iranians.HANNITY: That's never a good position to negotiate.GATES: And that's never a good position to negotiate in.But I think, as you think about the conversations you've been having, the real issue, it seems to me, as the Iranians get $150 billion, is the absence of a strategy of pushback from the administration to parallel this nuclear deal. Where is the strategy on how we're going to invest money, how the weapons we are prepared to provide to our allies and friends in the region, what are we prepared to do in terms of military presence, covert action, diplomacy and so on, to push back consistently against the Iranians' use of this money to interfere elsewhere in the region?HANNITY: You know -- yes, you know, the first chapter in your book is ""Why bureaucrats so often fail us.""(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: And to me, it ought to be a prerequisite that if you're negotiating with a country and they're simultaneously during negotiations burning your flag, burning your closest ally's flag, chanting death to your country and threatening to wipe your ally's country off the face of the earth that maybe that's not -- maybe that ought to be a prerequisite to negotiations. But it wasn't. Why?GATES: What we have to do is to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We negotiated with the Soviet Union under President Reagan, but at the same time, we were undergoing a major military buildup. And we were resisting them around the world in a variety of places, all of the meddling and interference they were trying to do.So you have to signal -- if you want to limit nuclear weapons, that's one thing. But you also have to show that you're prepared to deal with their actions outside of the nuclear arena wherever they occur.HANNITY: And this president did not do that. You know, you have a very unique perspective because you served under George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Tell me the difference. I'm obviously a very strong critic of this president. I think he projects weakness. I think that without America's leadership on the world stage, I think you see the world in more chaos and decline. I think the world needs America's strength.He seems to look at American strength as somewhat of a negative. Tell me the difference between the two. Bring me into the mind of the Barack Obama you knew.GATES: Well, I think that, first of all, my -- I have two concerns, have two concerns that I've written about. One is that he seems to be unwilling to trust subordinates to execute his policies, and so he's centralized operational activities in the White House.So under previous administrations that I worked for, there might be 40 or 50 professionals on the National Security Counsel staff, there are now hundreds. And I once asked the national security adviser, How many people do you have working on Iraq and Afghanistan? He said 25. That was half the size of the Scowcroft NSC, half the size of George W. Bush's, or about less than -- a fraction of -- I mean, it's many times the size of the NSC under George W. Bush. So this micromanagement out of the White House was one concern.The other concern is execution, of being able to make a decision and/or articulate a vision and then execute it in policy. And a perfect example is the Cairo speech that he gave early in the administration, about, Here's what we're going to do in the Middle East, and so on, led to a lot of euphoria, and then nothing. There was no strategy. There was no implementation. The result was bitterness in the Middle East because it was just seen as hollow rhetoric.HANNITY: Well, and later, he was also supporting Mohamed Morsi, the head of the Muslim Brotherhood, a guy that once referred to the Israelis as the descendants of apes and pigs.Let me -- let me ask you this question. I am livid that after Vietnam, we pull out. 58,000 Americans died there. We've lost nearly 5,000 lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. And then this president pulls out early, and Mosul and Tikrit and Fallujah and Ramadi end up in the hands of ISIS.It seems to me if we are going to ask American men and women to risk their lives and shed their blood and lose their limbs, that we ought to define victory. We keep allowing politics to be seen through the -- we keep allowing war to be seen through the prism of politics. And if I'm the mother or father of a kid that lost their lives in one of those cities, I'm saying, Why?Do we need to change how we approach war in this country?GATES: I think we do. I think we need to, first of all, be -- be much more careful about when we use military force and then use it overwhelmingly. We've really only won one war since World War II, and that was the first Gulf war.HANNITY: Yes.GATES: And that was because President Bush...HANNITY: Overwhelming force.GATES: President Bush, Sr., articulated specific objectives, accomplished those objectives and quit.HANNITY: Can we -- do we -- are we close to the time where technology -- where we're not going to have to send young men door to door, like we did in Iraq, that we can fight and win wars with technology and not send these guys on the ground, like we had to in Iraq?GATES: No, I don't think we are.HANNITY: Don't think we're going to get there.GATES: No. We will have tools that they can use, but this is why presidents have to be so careful about going to war because it always, at the end of the day -- General Stillwell in World War II once said that no matter how a war starts, it always ends up in mud.HANNITY: Will we see more...GATES: And that means foot soldiers.HANNITY: Will we see more hostages as a result of this deal?GATES: Well, I don't know. It's certainly a risk.HANNITY: All right. Mr. Secretary, good to see you. Thank you for your service for all these years.GATES: Thank you.HANNITY: Appreciate it.GATES: Thank you.HANNITY: And coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you look what's going on throughout the world, you look at Syria, where there -- if you're Christian, they're chopping off heads. You look at the different places, and Christianity -- it's under siege!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump speaking at Liberty University earlier today. Well, Jerry Falwell, Jr., will join us.And then later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: He's a nasty guy. Nobody likes him. Nobody in Congress likes him. Nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him.CRUZ: We need a leader who is prepared to do what is ever needed to keep this country safe, and that typically doesn't include spending your time on Twitter.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, the gloves are off. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz are in an all-out war of words as they now battle for the top spot in Iowa. We'll discuss the growing feud, the latest poll numbers and much more tonight on this busy news night on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWS BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to protect Christianity. And I can say that. I don't have to be politically correct or -- we're going to protect it.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: If you look what's going on throughout the world, you look at Syria, where there -- if you're Christian, they're chopping off heads. You look at the different places, and Christianity -- it's under siege.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, that was Donald Trump speaking to students at Liberty University in Lynchberg earlier today. Now, Trump vowed to set aside political correctness and protect Christianity around the globe.Here with reaction, the president of Liberty University, Jerry Falwell, Jr. It wasn't quite an endorsement, but many people took it as almost one when you said -- you know, you introduced him as one of the greatest visionaries of our time and you've remained in close contact with him.Does your position prevent you from endorsing? That kind of sounded like an endorsement.JERRY FALWELL, JR., LIBERTY UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT: Well, Liberty University is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) university. So of course, Liberty cannot endorse candidates, and we invite all the candidates to come speak.But I got to know Donald Trump after he spoke here in 2012. And I learned so much about him that the public never hears, and I wanted to share that with our audience. Right after he visited here last time, he -- I called him about a large Christian ministry in another state that needed some help. I learned within a day or two he had donated $100,000 of his own money. He learned about Clyde Frasier (ph), Jr., who ran the Harlem Hoops tournament in the inner city and was killed in the 9/11 attacks, and he searched down the family and he donated the money to keep that tournament going.Example after example like that of just generosity that never made it into the public's eye. He got -- his limousine broke down one time, a couple stopped and helped him. He paid off their mortgage a few days later. These are all things that you never hear about Donald Trump because he comes across as sort of a tough businessman.And it just reminded me so much of my father because my father would say -- make politically incorrect statements all those years, and in real life and his personal relationships with people he gave away so many scholarships to students at Liberty, he almost bankrupted the school here. He -- he was always...(LAUGHTER)FALWELL: He was always...HANNITY: Yes, scholarships, scholarships, scholarships. And I know that's true. Here's one thing people didn't know about your dad -- the limousine story is interesting. So a couple stopped to help him, and he paid off their mortgage. That's pretty impressive. And people would say, OK, well, he has the money to do it, but there are a lot of wealthy people that don't do things like that. But I knew something about your dad...FALWELL: And he -- no, I was going to say, on ""60 Minutes,"" Trump was watching a report about a Maytag plant that moved out of Iowa into Mexico, and the three companies in that report, he actually searched them out. They were about to go out of business because Maytag had left, and he found ways to buy products from those companies through his hotels to keep them in business.He gave the money to the local Domino's pizza restaurants so they could buy cheese and bread and keep their business in business. And those are just things I thought the world needed to know about Donald Trump because the Bible says, By their fruits you shall know them.And he may not be a theological expert and he might say ""2 Corinthians instead of ""second Corinthians,"" but when you look at the fruits of his life and all the people he's provided jobs, I think that's the true test of a somebody's Christianity, not whether or not they use the right theological terms.HANNITY: You know...FALWELL: But I'm sorry. Go ahead, Sean.HANNITY: You told me on my radio show a while back, and you mentioned this today -- and by the way, those pictures of convocation. I've had the honor to speak there. And that is an experience like no other. It's amazing.But you see a lot of your dad in Donald Trump. That, I think, surprised a lot of people. Explain.FALWELL: Well, my father was criticized for supporting Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter because Ronald Reagan was a Hollywood actor who had been divorced and remarried. Jimmy Carter was a Sunday school teacher.And my father said -- he said proudly that Jesus said, Render unto Caesar, and that means be good citizens, be voting citizens. And he said, When I go in the voting booth, I'm not electing a Sunday school teacher or a theologian or somebody who agrees with my theological views, I'm voting for the person who is most qualified to be the president of the United States. And the qualities that are required to be the president are not always the same ones that make a good Sunday school teacher.Prime example of that is Jimmy Carter. He was a great Sunday school teacher, but look what he did to our country as president.HANNITY: All right...FALWELL: And so those are the kind of things that remind me of my father and Trump. And I think -- I think just the personal generosity -- I noticed at the debate in Charleston the other night, he was the only candidate who came down off the stage and greeted the crowd personally, posed for pictures. Everybody else was too important, too busy, too tired.And that's the kind of thing that -- you know, we've been promised as evangelicals and conservatives -- so many promises have been made to us by career politicians over the last few decades. You know, I told the crowd this morning the polls seem to indicate -- the founding fathers believed that this country should be governed by citizen legislators, and I think the polls are starting to indicate that the American public want to see somebody who has succeeded in real life...HANNITY: Yes.FALWELL: ... not career politicians. And I think that's why he's surging.HANNITY: Does that mean he got a bigger crowd than I did at convocation? Is that what you're telling me, an overflow crowd?FALWELL: Well, he -- well, not too much bigger, but yes, bigger. It was a little bigger, and we had...(CROSSTALK)FALWELL: ... walking around campus...HANNITY: It was full. There wasn't an empty seat over there.FALWELL: But they all loved -- but they loved -- they loved you, too, Sean. Place was full both times.HANNITY: All right, Jerry Falwell, Jr., thank you for being with us. Appreciate it.And coming up next tonight right here on this busy ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: He's a nasty guy. Nobody likes him. Nobody in Congress likes him. Nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him.CRUZ: We need a leader who is prepared to do what is ever needed to keep this country safe. And that typically doesn't include spending your time on Twitter.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, the Iowa caucus is only two weeks away. The rhetoric is now heating up between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Our panel will weigh in next.And later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FMR. SEC. OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The fact is we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party and of our country!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, the fourth boring Democratic debate is now in the books, and Hillary Clinton spent most of the night defending the president and his terrible policies. This will be what, another third Obama term? We'll play that next straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" Now, with the Iowa caucuses just two weeks away, the candidates -- well, they're starting to feel the pressure and a feud now is brewing between the top two Republican candidates, Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz.Over the weekend, Trump said this about his GOP rival.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, the truth is he's a nasty guy. He was so nice to me -- I mean, I knew it. I was watching. I kept saying, Come on, Ted. Let's go, Ted.But he's a nasty guy. Nobody likes him. Nobody in Congress likes him. Nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him. He's a very -- he's got an edge that's not good. You can't make deals with people like that. And it's not a good thing. It's not a good thing for the country. Very nasty guy. Then he got caught the other day in a tape when he was raising funds at a law office, talking about things that are priorities and not priorities (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think he's a hypocrite?TRUMP: Oh, he's a total hypocrite.HANNITY: And Senator Cruz -- he's not letting Trump's attacks slide. He fired back with this earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald did an interview where he described that he thinks he's bigger than Ronald Reagan. You know, I think the American people will make that determination.You know, I would note that Ronald Reagan spent decades as a principled conservative, spent decades traveling the country sharing his conservative free market views, defending the Constitution. Ronald Reagan did not spend the first 60 years of his life supporting Democratic politicians, advocating for big government politics.We need a leader who is prepared to do what is ever needed to keep this country safe, and that typically doesn't include spending your time on Twitter.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, here now with reaction, from The National Review, Jonah Goldberg, and FOX News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera, and from The Washington Times, FOX news contributor Monica Crowley.You know, I wish this didn't happen every election, but if we're going to be real, go back to 2000 and George Bush and John McCain in South Carolina. It was brutal.I don't like it. Conservatives are getting angry at Trump because they like Ted Cruz. It's different than, quote, ""an establishment candidate."" How -- what do you think of this back-and-forth?MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you've got two alpha males who are going at it like two scorpions in a bottle. I always thought that it would behoove both of them to keep their bit of an alliance going for as long as possible because they could have helped each other.HANNITY: It's 14 days, 14 days, Monica, and it's over.CROWLEY: Ted Cruz could have helped deliver evangelicals to Trump, Trump could have gotten more conservative, traditional conservatives from Cruz. But they are in a competition and only one can win. And whereas Ted Cruz needs to win Iowa, Donald Trump wants to win Iowa. And so I expect that from here on out it's only going to get more intense.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: It seems to me that they're trying to label the other guy the hypocrite. He's saying, you know, look at Ted Cruz, he's not even an American. He's born in Canada. Not only that, he says he's going to regulate banks or take on banks and he takes money from Goldman Sachs.HANNITY: He didn't take money. He borrowed money.RIVERA: Borrowed money. But I really think Ted Cruz does have a nasty streak. Maybe because I'm inherently sympathetic to Donald Trump. But Ted Cruz, why is it that nobody likes him in the United States Senate?HANNITY: I'll tell you why. I'll give you the answer, because he's the one guy who stood up and took on his own party.RIVERA: Closing down the government?CROWLEY: He didn't close down the government.HANNITY: No, he was going to fulfill a campaign promise, Geraldo.Let me go to Jonah. I actually tweeted out earlier, Jonah. I don't apologize for supporting insurgent candidates. And the truth that's not talked about is that the establishment Republicans in many ways created this insurgency. Isn't that true?JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"": I think there's truth to that. The whole chaos that we're going through right now is largely the function of the failures, lots of failures, years of failures structurally among the establishment or whatever you want to call it, and I think that's absolutely true.At the same time, look, almost all of these criticisms that Donald Trump is making of Ted Cruz are hypocritical of him to make. The idea that Donald Trump plays well with others is kind of undermined by the last six months that we've seen him in these races. He always goes for the cheap low blow. He compared Ben Carson to a pedophile or something. The idea that somehow now Donald Trump is saying that Ted Cruz has a nasty streak?HANNITY: Here's the flipside of it, Monica. If you get in a general election with Hillary, do you want the guy that's going to fight her hard? And he's already shown he is willing to take her on and the Clintons on in a way that nobody else will.CROWLEY: You want somebody who has been deep in the competition, who has absorbed punches from their own side so that they're more prepared to take punches from the other side, because whether the Democratic candidate is Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, or somebody else, you want a candidate who is prepared, who knows how to dish it and to take it and how to dish it out and take it. Both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are in that position now.I'm with you. We don't like to see conservatives or Republican candidates beating each other up, but this is presidential politics. And I'd rather see it now --GOLDBERG: You were fine with it when Donald Trump was doing it to everybody else. Let's just be straight about this. The idea that all of a sudden you don't like these guys attacking each other --RIVERA: They can take care of themselves.HANNITY: But I think the difference is, Jonah, is that I think conservatives are like Ted Cruz more than they do some of these establishment guys.GOLDBERG: No, I think that's true, sure. That's absolutely fine. And the people who are lining up behind Trump were also ling up behind Ted Cruz for a very long time. And now all of a sudden, and I understand Geraldo's enjoying this because this is sort of like the Iran-Iraq war.HANNITY: Come on, Jonah, geez.RIVERA: That's when Henry Kissinger said he hopes they both lose. But I think Trump has the only chance really against the demographic headwinds that the Republican candidate faces of getting --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: I think that African-Americans might if Trump stays on this crazy immigration thing, see in his policies some kind of salvation in terms of - -HANNITY: But does he put New Jersey and Pennsylvania in play?RIVERA: I think he puts in play a lot of people, a lot of Reagan Democrats. I absolutely think that.HANNITY: Can Cruz do that?RIVERA: Chris Christie did it. Why couldn't Donald Trump?CROWLEY: I think Cruz can, too. It comes down to Trump and Cruz. Then you have a different dynamic going into what we --HANNITY: You're right.CROWLEY: -- would have to choose from in the general.HANNITY: We've got to roll. Guys, good to see you.RIVERA: I was there when Ted Cruz was begging for money right here in Manhattan.HANNITY: And coming up next right here on HANNITY --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The fact is we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Her highness, Hillary Clinton, did her best to defend President Obama's disastrous policies at last night's Democratic debate. In case you didn't see it, we'll play you the tape.Also, remember back in 2001 when President Clinton pardon the billionaire Marc Rich? Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer is here and says that pardon, quote, ""continues to pay big time for Bill and Hillary."" That investigation straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. So last night 2016 Democratic presidential candidates faced off in South Carolina at their fourth -- well, boring debate. Frontrunner Hillary Clinton spent a lot of time defending President Obama and his awful policies. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: The fact is we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, I'm very proud of the Iran nuclear agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office.I'm going to defend Dodd-Frank and I'm going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry, and getting results.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Oh, boy. Here with reaction, FOX News contributor Democratic pollster Doug Schoen, and Republican strategist Lisa Boothe Hillary was asked, and I'm raising this for a question, is she sucking up to Obama because she wants a third Obama term or maybe she wants some help with the FBI. She was asked that question yesterday, has she spoken with the FBI?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In terms of the status of the FBI investigation into your private email server, have you been interviewed by the FBI yet?CLINTON: No.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You haven't. All right, Secretary Clinton, thanks so much. Really appreciate your time. Good luck with the debate tonight.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: OK. And then the most Googled question on Hillary Clinton during the debate was this -- will Hillary get prosecuted? It's a big deal. Is that why she's embracing Obama, or does she really want a third Obama term?LISA BOOTHE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: It could be. We also know that the FBI has expanded the scope of the investigation into public corruption charges, looking at the intersection between the Clinton Foundation and her time as secretary of state. But let's think about it for a moment of what she's defending here. Under President Obama, we've seen a record number of food stamps, a record number of Americans that are either unemployed or underemployed.HANNITY: In poverty.BOOTHE: In poverty. And more businesses than ever that are going under. And so that's exactly what she's defending here. And let's look also at what has happened on President Obama's watch. Democrats as a result of their policies like Obama care have lost 13 Senate seats, 69 House seats.HANNITY: And 900.BOOTHE: And 900 legislative seats.DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Can I offer a different explanation? Hillary is deeply worried about losing Iowa and New Hampshire. Her firewall are African-Americans particularly in South Carolina. Hence the defense of Obama to solidify the black vote which she will need if she loses both those primaries.HANNITY: OK. But as she wraps herself around the Obama persona, that's going to kill her in the general election.SCHOEN: She was his secretary of state, Sean. She doesn't have much choice.HANNITY: I know. But I would think at this point she probably wants some distance from him.SCHOEN: Not when she needs his constituency to get nominated in an increasingly tight Democratic primary.HANNITY: What do you think?BOOTHE: What we're seeing is Hillary Clinton is flat-lining. If you actually look at the trend lines of polling comparatively speaking to 2008, she's in worse shape heading into Iowa and New Hampshire and nationally than she was there.SCHOEN: So you're agreeing with me.BOOTHE: I am agreeing with you. I think she's in trouble. The majority of Americans do not trust her.HANNITY: I don't like Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is an angry old socialist curmudgeon from New Jersey -- from Vermont. I could never see this guy as president.SCHOEN: That's what's happened to the Democratic Party and why people like me who are capitalists and moderates really don't have a in a left wing Democratic Party.HANNITY: So you're voting for Trump or Cruz?SCHOEN: I'm increasingly moving to the center. I would probably vote for Hillary against Trump or Cruz, but I like Donald Trump. I think Cruz made a bad mistake -- I think Cruz made a bad mistake dividing on so-called New York values. That hurt me. It was wrong.HANNITY: It may help him in Iowa.SCHOEN: It may help him in Iowa, but he'll do the same thing you say Hillary's doing. It's going to hurt him overall.BOOTHE: Hillary Clinton can't even separate the Democratic Party from socialists.HANNITY: She doesn't know what the difference is.BOOTHE: She doesn't know what the difference is because is there a difference right now.SCHOEN: She does know. The problem the Democratic Party has moved closer to socialism.HANNITY: All right, I got to roll. Good to see you. Thank you.SCHOEN: Thank you.BOOTH: Thank you.HANNITY: And coming up, back in 2001 then president Bill Clinton pardoned a guy by the name of Marc Rich. You remember that? Up next, the author of ""Clinton Cash"" Peter Schweizer explains why he says that this move, quote, ""continues to pay big time for the Clintons."" Do you really want another Clinton in the White House? That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. So another one of Bill Clinton's scandals from his troubled presidency is coming back to haunt Hillary Clinton's run for the White House. In an article for the ""New York Post"" author Peter Schweizer exposes how the Clintons have benefitted from Bill's infamous presidential pardon of international fugitive Marc Rich. This was back in 2001.Now, Schweizer writes, quote, ""But while the pardon was a political mistake it certainly was not a financial one. In the years following the scandal the flow of funds from those connected to Marc Rich or the pardoned scandal have continued to help the Clinton. And Rich died in 2013, but his business partners, lawyers, advisers and friends have showered millions of dollars on the Clintons in the decade and a half following the scandal.""Here with reaction, author of ""Clinton Cash,"" the president of the Government Accountability Institute, Breitbart senior editor at large Peter Schweizer is back. And this never ends. You talked a lot about the money coming in from countries that have atrocious human rights records and women's rights records. And you have the pardon of Marc Rich, they've benefited big time financially. Explain this.PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR, ""CLINTON CASH"": Yes, that's right, Sean. If you remember the Marc Rich scandal, Marc Rich was on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. Bill Clinton on his last day in office pardons him. A lot of people were shocked and surprised, including his political allies. And what an investigation found up after the fact was that in a run-up to that pardon. Denise Rich, Marc Rich's ex-wife, had written large checks to the Clinton Foundation and to the Democratic Party.What we found in researching the donations since that pardon is that the flow of cash of people connected to Marc Rich has continued. As you pointed out, Bill Clinton has said this was a political mistake. It certainly has not been a financial one. They have reaped a lot of financial rewards because of what they did for Marc Rich.HANNITY: This is a guy, by the way, who traded illegally with America's enemies, including the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. And he brought about $200 million worth of oil while revolutionaries allied with Khomeini had American hostages. This is not a good guy. This is a guy that was apparently a lot of his wealth selling oil to the apartheid regime in South Africa. We reached out to the Clinton Foundation. Interestingly, Peter, they didn't respond to us. Why?(LAUGHTER)SCHWEIZER: Yes, big surprise. You're exactly right. Marc Rich was a bad, bad dude. And by the way, all of the things that you mentioned bout him trading with the Ayatollah Khomeini, with North Korea, with the apartheid regime in South Africa, even after the 2001 pardon, it came out after that fact that he was continuing in his bad ways. He was implicated in the oil for food scandal involving the Iraqi government and Saddam Hussein. So it's not like this is a guy who was repentant for what he had done.And yet the Clintons have taken a $1 billion pledge from Marc Rich's long time business partner. They've taken money from his lawyers. They've taken money from all sorts of people directly connected to Marc Rich. And it just indicates they're pretty much willing to take money from anybody.HANNITY: How much money are we talking about?SCHWEIZER: It's hard to say because they reveal the contributions in ranges. But it is certainly more than $10 million. There is a $1 billion with a ""b"" pledge that Gilbert Chagoury, Marc Rich's long time business partner, has made. We don't know how much of that has been honored, but it's a large sum of money.And by the way, Sean, as I point out in the piece, there are still more than 1,000 contributors to the Clinton Foundation that have never been disclosed. Those are people basically from the natural resources industry which is commodities and mining. That was Marc Rich's industry, so the possibility that there is more is certainly out there.HANNITY: Is it fair to say that countries with atrocious human rights records like Saudi Arabia and all these others that donated to the Clinton Foundation bought Hillary's silence, and that in this case there was sort of like a wink and a nod, a quid pro quo, you get your pardon, we expect your help later?SCHWEIZER: Yes, it's a good question. I get asked this a lot. How does the Clinton business model work? And I basically think there are two ways. One is basically payment for services rendered, right? A pardon takes place, we're going to take care of you. I think the other arrangement the Clinton's have is kind of a retainer arrangement, right? We'll continue to provide you with funds. We may not need you to do something right now. We may need you to do something later on. So both of those are definitely in play and involve some really, really bad people.HANNITY: All right, thanks so much, appreciate it, Peter.When we come back, we need your help, our ""Question of the Day.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right, time for our ""Question of the Day."" So what do you think of the Iran hostage prisoner swap? Just go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.That is all the time we have left this evening.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and Brian Kilmeade. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Trump turns up the heat. The Republican presidential nominee goes all on bashing his Democratic opponents with voters heading to the polls in just 14 weeks from today. Trump is rallying for support by slamming Clinton, claiming the election is not fair.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It's a crooked system. It's a rigged system. We're running against a rigged system and we're running against a very dishonest media.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Remember the nickname? Crooked Hillary? Well, now Trump hits Clinton even harder as he explains why he thinks Bernie Sanders made a big mistaken endorsing her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: He made a bad deal. He should have not made a deal. He would have gone down as done something really important. Once he made that deal. And believe me, he has buyer's remorse. If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relax -- he would have been a hero. But he made a deal with the devil. She's the devil. He made a deal with the devil.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right, Eric, a new nickname sort of doubling down on the Crooked Hillary. What do you think? Is the messaging working?ERIC BOLLING,  CO-HOST: I think he needed to do that. And he needed to get off the con issue and I think that's a good way to do it, call her the devil.GUILFOYLE: Who does it help him with?BOLLING: Everyone. The media. You know now we're talking about this. We're opening with this instead of talking about the back and forth with the content (ph) which is, I think spot on. This is what he needed to do. But again, I think what he needs to do is run against Hillary Clinton. Not run against, you know, all these other factions, all these other issues. Run against Hillary Clinton, make her out to be the crooked, the lying Hillary Clinton, she lied to Chris Wallace on a couple of issues on Sunday. Stay with that. That's where you're, that's where you're going to excel as a candidate, not trying to hit her or hit other -- defend himself against, you know, the military families. He even went after, I think, some of the, you know, the fire warden at one of his events. Stay off that stuff. This is, this is about you against a flawed candidate in Hillary Clinton and keep exposing all the flaws in her. And I think he's going to do a good job with that, too. There are plenty of them.BRIAN KILMEADE, GUEST CO-HOST: I think President Obama, too.BOLLING: Yeah.KILMEADE: I mean President Obama made it clear, he's running, too, today.BOLLING: Yeah, yup.GUILFOYLE: OK.BOLLING: Third term.KILMEADE: Yes. I mean, what he did today, I thought was unbelievable with the prime minister of Singapore sitting there, he decides to .BOLLING: Take shots at Trump.KILMEADE: . domesticate it and take shots .BOLLING: Take shots at Trump. Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.KILMEADE: . as if he's running against Donald Trump.GUILFOYLE: Let's take a listen to that. We get Dana to respond.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Yes. I think the republican nominee is unfit to serve as president. I said so last week and he keeps on proving it. What does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer? And that's not just my opinion. That is the opinion of many prominent republicans. There has to come a point at which you say, enough.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK, Dana, what do you think about this whole thing? Start with the, you know, the president comment.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Can I go back to the beginning?GUILFOYLE: Absolutely.PERINO: I think it is pretty astounding that in order to get off the con story that you don't go to the issue that we're have this abysmal economic growth, the lowest of record, a homeownership that -- since they started making records. I mean there are so many things that you could down the list on to attack Hillary Clinton and say, there's no change here. But to call her the devil, I don't think that's going to work so well. For Obama, I think that -- I understand the temptation. He is very good at campaigning. He probably thinks that Hillary Clinton is not that good at campaigning. So, he probably thinks he's offering her assistance. I don't think that's true. In this setting with, when you're sitting with another world leader and you're talking about on the merits, trade or whatever it is. If you were asked about Trump, don't take the bait. Say, I've already come -- I was at the convention, you have my speech. So there will be plenty of time to talk about that another time. Right now, I'm here with the leader of Singapore and let's talk about something like that. That's when he -- I think that he could have done. The other thing on Donald Trump is that -- let's say that it was a great tactic. If you think it was a great tactic to go after Hillary Clinton, try to pivot, that will be fine, but that won't be the news story in the next few hours, because Donald Trump came out and attacked Paul Ryan and John McCain. So now you have more intra- party warfare.GUILFOYLE: Saying he won't support.PERINO: Saying that he's not prepared to support them after they have stuck their necks out for him. And they had -- and it wasn't just Paul Ryan and John McCain that had to distance themselves on the con comments. Every republican that has a tough race like Kelly Ayotte, he just said that's she is a weak leader up in New Hampshire. I mean, it is like a wholesale destruction of the Republican Party when he actually has everything going for him if he chose to use it.GUILFOYLE: All right Juan, so I see you shaking your head. So you think this was not good? What about the president making a comment?JUAN WILLIAMS, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: Well, let me just say. First of all, I disagree with Eric. I mean, you can try to pivot away from the con story, but I think this invites people and especially people who are in the middle, Eric, the persuadables, and I'm looking here at women. You're calling her the devil, right? I mean basically, you're saying, you know, this is a witch. This is an evil, (inaudible) or whatever you say. I mean you -- we gone. He's -- I mean Carson already said she's Lucifer. I mean this is now -- I mean, it's like, wait a minute. What are you doing here? Gentlemen, slow down. It's easy to critique your opponent in just the way that we heard Brian and Dana suggest. Those are real facts. You have to have a conversation.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But the bullying and the name calling.BOLLING: Right, right.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: What does that say about Donald Trump?BOLLING: And they're both right and they're both factually correct. And that's OK, yes, but in order to change the news cycle .WILLIAMS: But Eric, what would you --BOLLING: . you have to be provocative now.WILLIAMS: Why would he play into a negative stereotype about himself as a bully and a guy who bully and who calls women --BOLLING: Because Donald thinks it's that negative -- well, I don't mind.GUILFOYLE: I don't think --WILLIAMS: . who calls women names.GUILFOYLE: I don't think his supporters that are super, that are baked in for him are going to mind, but --WILLIAMS: No, that's right.GUILFOYLE: What about, you know, rebuilding a bridge, getting more supporters, getting traction, trying to increase your poll numbers, trying to reach out to women, to minorities .WILLIAMS: Can I hire you?GUILFOYLE: . and independents.WILLIAMS: That was exactly what I was trying to say.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Hired for a dollar.(LAUGHTER)KILMEADE: Put it this way, he actually, this medal that was handed out there, we've gotten hold of that shows that there are some a degree of seriousness amongst the Trump group that says, ""Hey, wait a second. Surrogates, this is what you do to get out of this mess with the con situation. And this is how we go from here that the damage, you know, we're taking on water."" And I also think that there are very few more opportunities that Donald Trump has to start fresh. He can win this thing. He's actually raising money. He actually is in the game in battleground states. In many situations, he is now building a team that is formidable. He actually has an infrastructure around him. And he continues again, today, to call out republicans. He cannot be listening to Paul Manafort. He cannot be looking to his communications team.BOLLING: Why would he stop now?GUILFOYLE: You say he's not because --BOLLING: This is something he has done for --(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: No.BOLLING: For 14 months.KILMEADE: He has not attacked republicans in a long time.BOLLING: Oh, come on Brian --KILMEADE: And Paul Ryan, he rendered --BOLLING: They didn't support him. He had Paul Ryan --KILMEADE: When was the time he attack Paul Ryan?BOLLING: When he didn't support him. Remember he said, ""I'm not -- if you don't support me, I can't support your agenda.""KILMEADE: And guess what happened, Paul Ryan's in. Senator John McCain yesterday said, ""Despite everything you said"" --BOLLING: My point is --KILMEADE: ""Despite my two-page letter, I still support Donald Trump."" He told the reporter, ""I'll let you know when I will stop.""BOLLING: He called John McCain a loser. He's never apologized for that in the past.KILMEADE: No, no. I talked to Donald Trump, four days ago. I said, is John McCain a war hero or not? He said, ""Yes.""BOLLING: I mean, I -- right. Correct. Agree with all of that. But you're saying, at some point he's got a pivot and be more -- he'll be enough -- more apologetic or nice to the candidate --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Just so, he knocked off 16 opponents in the primary. He's got one to go.KILMEADE: That's June.BOLLING: He raised 56 million --KILMEADE: He hasn't done that since May.BOLLING: Fifty-six million dollars last month, that's a pretty darn good money.KILMEADE: Awesome.PERINO: I think I'm getting your point.KILMEADE: Get your message straight. He has bullet points. He's got winning bullet points. Ron Fournier was just, just wrote a column, said they've been covering Clinton since '86.PERINO: Yeah.KILMEADE: She should be a light years ahead of everybody right now, but the problem is, she keeps lying. This is somebody who misleads the direction.GUILFOYLE: But that's (inaudible) to work with.BOLLING: The point is giving Hillary Clinton advice, not Donald Trump.GUILFOYLE: You got to hit the points like the economy, like Dana said.KILMEADE: And instead, it would be talking about that she's Lucifer .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.KILMEADE: . that Governor Christie --GUILFOYLE: Guys, let me get in --WILLIAMS: That's what I said.GUILFOYLE: Let me get in this and go to Dana about Rudy Giuliani. We're talking about this earlier. But former New York City Mayor Giuliani offers some good advice, in fact, for how Trump can come out on top of all the recent attacks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: My advice to Donald would be very simple. I'll tell you the advice I'd give him. You have one person to attack; Hillary Clinton. And Barack Obama, because it's the Obama administration who let all of us -- myself, Gingrich, Christie, his whole army, let us attack everybody else. That's always been my rule in politics, which is, ""You're running against one person, don't run against the world.""(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Dana?PERINO: Smart. And it's traditional. And it's how the establishment has run campaigns for years. And I don't think Donald Trump doesn't like it, and it's not in his instincts. But the thing is, is that he has all these people around him are trying to help him. They are, actually like.KILMEADE: Unbelievable.PERINO: . putting themselves out there and saying, ""OK, I'll be with you. I'll be with you."" And then they get a memo like the thing, ""Oh, sorry. Actually, you can't say that. Oh, wait. Don't say that either. Wait, try to think"" -- Donald Trump has a responsibility here to help them help him. You know, they can't just be out there doing that all on their own. And Rudy is right -- excuse me, Mr. Mayor. I would never call you Rudy, just by your first name. I think the mayor is absolutely correct, that that is what he can focus on. I don't think calling her the devil is necessary the best way to do it. Do it on the merits. There are so many things that he could say on the merits, especially when it comes to the economy. It -- that it is true, that the story about the economy, abysmal numbers that came out Friday with the 1.2 percent .(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . economic growth last quarter.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: That story got buried by the con remarks. It doesn't mean that story is dead. That is what the numbers were from the quarter. There were a lot more other -- there are a lot of other numbers in there, and I know you want to move on, but anyway .GUILFOYLE: No, I don't know.PERINO: . I just think that the mayor is right.BOLLING: So --GUILFOYLE: I don't want to move on .BOLLING: Those are --GUILFOYLE: . but I want to hit that point you're talking about the economy.BOLLING: Those are excellent point.GUILFOYLE: Make a billboard out of it.BOLLING: Those are great political points. Those are great typical political points and Donald Trump is atypical. Everyone -- it's not just here, you hear it everywhere else. You hear, well, you know, he did well in the primary, but he's got to pivot back to more traditional, political campaign for the general, and he's saying, ""No, I don't."" And who are we to sit here and say, ""Well, you know, you crushed it in the primary, 16 opponents, took them out early, when no one else thought you could."" Why should he pivot to a traditional (inaudible)?WILLIAMS: Well, I tell you why.KILMEADE: Nine, nine.GUILFOYLE: To win.KILMEADE: Nine points he's trailing by in a national poll.BOLLING: Today. It's the first day after the convention.KILMEADE: But look who has --BOLLING: A day after the convention.KILMEADE: Has he stopped the bleeding with which what he's saying? Has he's anything that he has done to stop the bleeding that he started inflicting on himself?WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: I don't know --WILLIAMS: And let me just say Brain, it's worse than you describe. Because Brian, you said, ""Oh, no, people are coming together around him."" Dana said, ""People are trying to help him."" But you know what? On the numbers, fund-raising, in terms of campaign staffing, he is trailing badly.BOLLING: $56 million.WILLIAMS: Badly. Their Super PAC --BOLLING: So just he can raise $110 million .WILLIAMS: They have the Super PAC .BOLLING: . that no one else have.WILLIAMS: . that's with him right now is basically aiming at three states. And they don't even have money comparable to what Hillary Clinton has. And remember, Hillary Clinton has already run hundreds of ads, thousands of ads facts.KILMEADE: She's overstaffed.WILLIAMS: And he has not run any ads, it's the Super PAC that's coming. So in terms of staffing, putting people on the ground, they get out voters, you say, ""Oh, he's atypical.""BOLLING: Juan, Juan --WILLIAMS: Let me tell you something.BOLLING: I heard the same .WILLIAMS: You want to get voters out.BOLLING: . arguments in the primary. He'll never become the nominee with this kind of strategy. He's got to get more mainstream strategy.WILLIAMS: Let me tell you something, it's a different audience .GUILFOYLE: But now --WILLIAMS: . primary as to general.GUILFOYLE: But now it's a general election. Dana, if I understand what you're -- what you're saying is there's a lot of material for him to work with .PERINO: Sure.GUILFOYLE: . because he has her on the merits in terms of the abysmal economic growth. All those numbers are strong suits for him in addition to the lack of, you know, ethics, the loose relationship with the truth, someone who struggles with integrity. All these things he can use to mobilize his strategy, to gain more votes.PERINO: It's all right there. It's just his for the taking.GUILFOYLE: What would you hit with first thing tomorrow morning if you're in charge of that campaign?PERINO: I actually, you know, I am -- I am done trying to give advice. Because obviously, if it's too -- I'm just too typical of a person to give advice that would actually help a campaign. So I --KILMEADE: Right.PERINO: I don't know what I would tell him to do. I guess I could say be yourself, knock yourself out. I'll sit back and watch. I think it's very interesting. I think the demographics that are changing the country are very interesting. But I think on front -- on the advice front, I'm out.KILMEADE: What happened to Monday? Bombing Libya. A failed operation that she recommended, they have to go re-bomb again. We have to start bombing Libya again, because of an operation that she supported with absolutely no battle plan. I would start there.WILLIAMS: Do you know what he's bombing at the moment? His own campaign. He just fired two more top people today, and he's just going on. I mean this - - the memo Dana is talking about .(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: . the bombs are in-house. Someone is, you know, spoiling --(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: Still savable.GUILFOYLE: All right. So let's go. Much more to talk about a programming note, stay tuned ""On the Record"" tonight for Greta's interview with Ivanka Trump. That is at 7:00 p.m. eastern right here on the Fox News Channel. Do not miss it. And coming up, the problems keep piling on for Hillary Clinton this week, new questions today surrounding her involvement in Russia. Those details when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Hillary Clinton is getting a post-convention bump in the polls, but she still has some work to do, including the perception that she is dishonest. He had senior officials for her campaign reportedly disclaim trust is an issue for her. That's according to Ron Fournier from the National Journal. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RON FOURNIER, NATIONAL JOURNAL POLITICAL JOURNALIST: I literally had had senior officials, on the record or not on the record, on background a year ago saying, or more than a year ago, saying that trust doesn't matter, that Bill Clinton won even though he was trusted less than the two people he ran against. What they don't realize is the world has changed, and we now see that trust does matter. It's really destroyed her credibility. Now she could still win even by continuing this dispersing in this line. But then she's going to be leading a country where two-thirds of the people don't trust her. And you can't transform our politics. You can't do half of the things that she wants to do that need to be done if people don't trust her. So that's the miscalculation they're making.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Distrusts are bad for both candidates, about 55 percent, and baked in. I haven't moved at all. But you talk to Ron Fournier today and he said he expanded on those thoughts?KILMEADE: You know, he wrote the column in the ""Atlantic"" and he had this interview. And essentially he said, ""Look, he's not a Trump fan to say the least."" But he's saying that right now, she should have put this away already except for the fact that she has a problem with the truth. She's flat out lying when she -- when he watched Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace. He could not believe the fearless way in which she attacked the truth. And I think the term was, she lacked a total explanation on her e- mails and overall, her action during the investigation was an assault on the Freedom of Information Act. He is saying to himself, I've been covering you since '86 and this is beyond compare. He says in ""Today's America,"" trust matters. In Bill Clinton's era, trust didn't matter as much. And with they seem to have learned the wrong lesson.PERINO: Oh, I think it should be that -- could be the opposite. Kimberly, that trust used to matter a lot more than it does now.KILMEADE: But then why did George Bush, 41, lose to Bill Clinton even though his trust numbers were through the roof?PERINO: I think it was the economy. Stupid.KILMEADE: But --(LAUGHTER)KILMEADE: That was --PERINO: Not just to quote James Carville.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Right.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: But they say quote matters now.PERINO: I think is she going to say that?GUILFOYLE: Yes, you went there. I love d it.PERINO: What do you think on trust?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: I think it's better be important.GUILFOYLE: I think it is very important. And that's why I think it's one of the points that Trump should hammer home when they both have, obviously, you know, high unfavorables that really, I think Hillary can own this issue by virtue of the fact pattern. When you look at Benghazi and you look at the families, you look at e-mail server, you look at the disregard; the rules don't apply to us. You look at the Clinton Foundation, there's a tremendous amount of material to work with there, to sort of just cloud her in that. And you see then in some of the exit polls, I think it does matter. And people have a problem with it, because she should be doing far better than she is. She is not a good campaigner. I think she is a vulnerable candidate and it is ripe for the picking because she has a lot of holes in which you can hit her on and do some serious damage.PERINO: Her numbers got a little bit worse, Eric, when James Comey came out of the FBI director and said .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: . ""This is what we found. They did not indict her."" But that's when her poll numbers started to go down. They bounced back up after the convention. But maybe this is where it is baked in solid cake for her, that she is seen as dishonest by 55 percent of the people.BOLLING: And don't forget, after the convention on Sunday is when she lied again about what James Comey. She didn't hear him correctly and then Chris Wallace played the tape. Wait until you start getting into -- I know we're going to talk about the Clinton Foundation in a second, but let's talk about this for one second. Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, right?PERINO: Yeah.KILMEADE: Yup.BOLLING: That's nine years after Bill Clinton left office, right? The first time Bill Clinton started making $500,000 per speech -- he was making a lot less in the years after, directly after president. He didn't make start making half a million dollars per speech until 2009 when she became secretary of state. Doesn't that smell fishy to you a little bit? In fact, of the 13 times he has ever made $500,000 or more, 11 of them happened under her watch .PERINO: It's certainly --BOLLING: . '09 to '13.PERINO: It's certainly helped his speaking price.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: But why is that? There's a reason. Not because she was --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: . a secretary of state, because there were bills being made.PERINO: Access.BOLLING: Access, of course.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Well, there's another explanation.BOLLING: Oh, that I love to hear it.WILLIAMS: He was --BOLLING: Inflation?WILLIAMS: He was impeached and dishonored, if you recall. And so there was a period of time when he was out.PERINO: That's true.BOLLING: Nine years?WILLIAMS: Yes. Let me just tell you something. Remember --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Remember, Bush was in the White House, right?BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: So that was a republican time and a lot of people, the (inaudible). But Bill Clinton's reputation was tied into when he left and to the resentment from the Gore people and the like.BOLLING: But it --WILLIAMS: But I'm just telling --BOLLING: ... it just fixed itself after nine years, correct?WILLIAMS: No, no, no.BOLLING: Just like that.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. That is like --PERINO: Well the thing involvement is she like was a part of the rehabilitation.WILLIAMS: I'm just saying, OK.PERINO: Yeah.WILLIAMS: But I will say in regard to the honesty and truth issue. I think it's a liability. I think it's the primary weakness for Hillary Clinton.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: And that's why what we saw at the convention was an effort to put out a message that, you know what? This is someone we --KILMEADE: Grandma.WILLIAMS: . leading democrats from President Obama, to Michelle Obama, to Biden, to Kaine. Someone we can rely on, someone that we have still in and not.KILMEADE: No one else decides Hillary .WILLIAMS: Yeah.KILMEADE: . we can rely on.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. They're saying that Hilary Clinton, the real Hillary Clinton, not the caricature drawn at this table, but the real Hillary Clinton is the one who performs when, and creates .KILMEADE: But Juan, we just said .WILLIAMS: . with a passion.KILMEADE: . it was about 40 percent on this table .WILLIAMS: No, what --KILMEADE: . that keeps saying that she's not trustworthy.WILLIAMS: No. Look, look .GUILFOYLE: And the poll numbers said.WILLIAMS: Like Fournier said, this was a comment he heard more than a year ago, and it may be. But I'm telling you right now, it's an issue for Hillary Clinton. She has to address it. The key is, guess what? She's running against Donald Trump. His numbers are even worse.PERINO: I want to take a look at this sound bite. I didn't ask him what time we have. Let's look at this from Peter Schweizer last night on ""Hannity,"" talking about the Clinton Foundation issue with Russia.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER SCHWEIZER, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE PRESIDENT: The theory behind this is that we provide technology and have this initiative with the Kremlin, and it's going to strengthen relationships between the United States and Russia. The problem is, is that the 28 American companies who participate in this initiative of those 17 of them are major Clinton Foundation donors. And on the Russian side, the person that is running Skolkovo initiative and some of the participants are also giving money to the Clinton Foundation. So it's an example of sort of a crony relationship or the people that are participating .SEAN HANNITY, ""HANNITY"" HOST: All right. So --SCHWEIZER: . have financial ties to the Clintons.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Again, another point on the merits, Juan, that Donald Trump could actually say like, this is what we're talking about when we talk about the elites are too tied in. They have it all wired up here, even with Russia.WILLIAMS: Well, he -- I mean he has a lot of ties to Russia. We've been over that for the last couple of days.GUILFOYLE: Where are they? What ties?WILLIAMS: Huh?GUILFOYLE: What ties?WILLIAMS: Oh, gosh. Manafort has ties. He has business ties. Arguably, that's one of the reasons he won't put out his tax returns is because there may be some backing from Russian oligarchs and the like, but they're -- this is a legitimate issue again, the Clinton issue.PERINO: This is the issue that has always bothered you.WILLIAMS: The Clinton Foundation issue.PERINO: Yes.WILLIAMS: And whether or not, as I have said it, you know, there's a quid pro quo, then the deals and contributions that came especially from foreign governments while she was secretary of state. And as I understand, the FBI is still looking into this.KILMEADE: Well --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.KILMEADE: And John Podesta sat on a board of a company that took an investment from a Putin company, to the tune of $35 million. And that, according to Peter Schweizer, company's name is Rusnano. And if you're talking about ties to Russia, aren't they at least x'd (ph) out right there? Doesn't she want to change the subject now that this is exposed?(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: Unless it's not true.WILLIAMS: Imagine Brian, if you had someone other than Trump running. Oh my, God, you really would have an issue.BOLLING: And that --WILLIAMS: But with all of his Trump's -- he can't even understand the question that --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: He can't pull each other out.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Imagine cutting a deal to sell 25 percent of your uranium production.KILMEADE: Yeah.BOLLING: Imagine cutting a deal that they did.WILLIAMS: That's right.BOLLING: That's what exactly what they did.GUILFOYLE: But the point is Juan --BOLLING: That's disturbing.GUILFOYLE: You're saying was, oh, Trump may -- there is no specific evidence that he does, in fact, have a Russia problem, but here to me, it's not even speculative.WILLIAMS: Oh, no.GUILFOYLE: Hillary Clinton has a Russia problem.WILLIAMS: No, he --GUILFOYLE: I would focus on that and bang that drum all day.WILLIAMS: Well, that's fine. But I'm saying he has a bigger Russia problem, a bigger Russia problem. And when people think --GUILFOYLE: Which is what?WILLIAMS: Oh, do not be --KILMEADE: It might not be Putin, because he's $35 million worth.WILLIAMS: He loves Putin. He's praising Putin, he praises dictators. He says he doesn't know that Putin's invaded Ukraine. Are you kidding me?PERINO: I said who is the customer for that uranium?BOLLING: I've --PERINO: Right?BOLLING: Yeah, who knows? Maybe they could sell it to whomever.GUILFOYLE: Identify yourself.PERINO: All right, directly ahead. Black Lives Matter lays out a brand new list of demands while promoting violence against cops. We'll reveal their controversial policy agenda next, when we return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Welcome back. More than 60 groups associated with Black Lives Matter have release a controversial new policy agenda. The groups are demanding, among other things, reparations with they say a pass and continuing harms to African-Americans, an end to death penalty and legislation to acknowledge the effects of slavery. They also want added investment in education, mental health and jobs programs. So, Kimberly .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: ... does this strike you as reasonable?GUILFOYLE: I don't know. I mean, unfortunately for me, when I hear, like, Black Lives Matter, I really think of a group that is, at its core, divisive, that calls for violence, that has no respect for police officers or their families or their lives. So, to me, it's just -- it's not a group that I think has standing and credibility to be part of a unification and peace process going forward.WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I think -- I think it's 43 percent I have here of Americans support Black Lives Matter, but 36 percent say something a little different than what you're saying. They say they're unclear on their goals. And I would have to agree. I've never been clear on what they want.But you're saying you have a bigger issue?GUILFOYLE: But don't you think you should be -- you should be clear about a group and what they stand for before you endorse them or say you can agree? I mean, the idea of lives mattering -- of course Black Lives Matter. But of course, police officers' lives matter.I mean, when did we become so segregated and selective as to decide who has the right to announce and say that only their lives matter? I don't know.  It's a little bit foreign to me, since I have, you know, a little bit of a melting pot living in my body.KILMEADE: What do you mean by that?GUILFOYLE: Irish-Puerto Rican. I mean, going to pick one side over the other?KILMEADE: Right.GUILFOYLE: We have the best parades.KILMEADE: You don't -- you don't want to do type (UNINTELLIGIBLE).GUILFOYLE: I go to both parades.KILMEADE: A lot of parades.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: Eric, they start off by saying they want to end the war on black people. But then they go on to this list of items.BOLLING: Reparations.WILLIAMS: Reparations would stand out in my mind. But they also have things like, basically, they don't want police departments.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: Look, everyone has an agenda. Everyone has an idea. Everyone has an ideology. But the reparations part, what do they suggest? I mean, where are the reparations for the officers who are killed? Where are the reparations -- hold on. Where are the reparations for the African- Americans who are killed inner city? I mean, Chicago, the stats are insane. Sixty-five people killed in July, 400 in 2016, just in the city of Chicago alone.WILLIAMS: Amen.BOLLING: That far exceeds anything that's going on between an officer, an encounter with an officer and an African-American.WILLIAMS: Well, see you know what's interesting? I would say amen to what you just said about Chicago. And I wish that on their agenda, they would have said, ""We, as black people, are going to take responsibility and own this issue and stop the slaughter of black people by black people.""But that's not to say it's an illegitimate issue to talk about...BOLLING: Reparations?WILLIAMS: ... excessive use of force.BOLLING: No, no, no. That's fair. Of course it is.WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: Of course it is. But I have a problem with the reparations part.WILLIAMS: Well, I do, too. I just -- not only do I think it's extreme, I think it's unrealistic and invites mockery when we have a serious issue to discuss -- Dana.PERINO: Well, there's something -- I thought it was interesting that they finally put pen to paper and said, ""OK, well, then here's our list of demands,"" but their list is like really, really long.On one of them is education. And I thought I'd maybe get your thoughts on this. I feel like, if they want to change education, there's a path. They have to start thinking about who they're voting for.Today, did you see the news that the charter schools in New York state, New York City, for sure -- maybe all across the state -- did far and above better on their tests than -- now everybody did a little bit better this year. Probably that's because they changed the test.But the charter school results were just phenomenal, compared to the rest of the schools.And so there are ways to change things and to change education and make things better. And all -- those are not, you know, privileged white students that are taking that test. Those are a lot of African-American students, minority students.And so, if they really want to change education, where I think all of this starts for the next generation and the generation after that, I think that would be a place where we could maybe come together.WILLIAMS: By the way, the reading rates right now for African-American and Hispanic kids is appalling. It's not great for white kids. They're still behind the rest of the world. But I'm just telling you, if you're thinking about the future, as Dana is describing, why wouldn't you put that at the top of your agenda, Brian?KILMEADE: Well, you're the expert, and you're one of the best in the country at this. I feel ridiculous giving my opinion...WILLIAMS: No, no.KILMEADE: ... because you wrote a book on this, and I'm sitting here as a white guy. But let me just tell you...GUILFOYLE: Please don't speak.KILMEADE: ... I want -- yes, I'm not speaking for anybody, but I just said, if they're -- if black people and minorities are frustrated at the lack of mobility in society, I'd love to have the conversation about how to make it work. It's not going to be money; it's not going to be anger.  This is an angry list. Six demands, purporting policy priorities in response to a demand for black -- Black Lives Matter standing for something.WILLIAMS: Real quick, because they want me to tease. But so politically, does this help Mr. Law and Order? That's what Donald Trump's message was at his convention versus, I suppose, he thinks, Black Lives Matter. Who comes out on top in that discussion?KILMEADE: If he wants to get out of single digits with minorities, I'd love to see him adopt Paul Ryan's approach to that community, because he went and studied the black community.WILLIAMS: He won't even talk to Paul Ryan.PERINO: He's just not there yet.KILMEADE: That's a new first, I got ridiculed on a guest into my ear.  That's a new -- that's a new first. Everyone is yelling at me.WILLIAMS: OK. When we return, the Olympics kick off later this week. I'm looking forward to it. But today, we're learning disturbing new details about an ISIS threat to the summer games. Will Rio be terrorists' next target? Stay tuned to hear from Ryan (ph).(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KILMEADE: All right. There are growing concerns about terrorism in Rio, Brazil. Just days before the start of the Summer Olympics, a stunning new report says ISIS could hit the games with a radioactive dirty bomb. That's right. That's according to the head of counterterrorism in Brazil. As a result of the threat, security is being ramped up ahead of the opening ceremonies.Meanwhile ISIS urges supporters to, quote, ""break the cross"" and lists the reasons why it hates us. Yes, westerners. It's the latest issue in its propaganda magazine, which is not a sick name; that's our nickname for it.First, should we be worried, Eric? We hear about this all the time. In Russia...BOLLING: I'll tell you who should be worried. NBC should be worried.KILMEADE: Why?BOLLING: Because we have terror; we have Zika; we have bacteria and raw sewage in the water. We have athletes who say, ""I'm not going to participate."" They're typically young and single, may want to start a family soon. No one knows what the heck is going to go on in Rio. I think you're going to see...PERINO: Blame it on Rio.BOLLING: ... empty seats in the stands for an Olympics. That's insane, unheard of.KILMEADE: Dana, it was about 12 years ago when they got the World Cup, and Rio got -- and Brazil got the Olympic Games. The World Cup, they were building stadiums. There are white elephants sitting out there empty in places people don't even go. The money never got to the people. It got to the government.They've impeached their current president. The one, Lula, who was out of office, has now been indicted. The vice president is running things. And they came to us and the U.N. to say, ""Can you train our counterterrorism people?""PERINO: And they thought Chicago was corrupt.KILMEADE: Yes. We didn't get the Olympics.PERINO: This was the Olympics that President Obama went to pitch for.KILMEADE: Couldn't wait to get it.PERINO: We should have these things in America.KILMEADE: We should have had the World Cup.PERINO: I am for that. I hope that they don't have problems with terrorism. Of course we hope that.But I think the concern has to be that ISIS is not like al Qaeda in that there are these big catastrophic attacks planned by multiple people where you would have intelligence streams so that you could disrupt them.You have, like, the perpetrator in Nice who, whether working with somebody or not, basically pulled that off on his own. And you're going to have big crowds at these events. And I know that security guards will do their best, but if you have one determined terrorist, you're going to have a problem.KILMEADE: The other thing is, Kimberly, as you know, the attack in Brussels was originally supposed to be at a nuke site in -- in Belgium.  They were going to blow that up in some rudimentary way, with a truck bomb or something. So you don't know what they're capable of.GUILFOYLE: They're capable of just about anything. That's what we know, in fact. That they can use any means to achieve their goal. They've declared war against Christians, as well. That's on the cover of their magazine, against the cross.So they're very clear and specific in their purpose and their focus. And they're actually executing on it. So yes, I think they're really -- if you're evaluating the threat assessment as it relates to the Olympics, I'd say it's pretty bad. Because they even lack the infrastructure to properly protect against these type of attacks. I'm sorry. I'm just telling the truth here. I don't mean to frighten people.But when they're asking us to train their counterterrorism groups, they lack a core government constituency that's able to make change and make sure that this is locked down. I mean, I don't know. I think it's a huge problem.And then God help us, mosquitos. ISIS -- my personal ISIS, mosquitos. I couldn't go there. You just bring me, and they'll just bite me to death.  Oh, my god. It's the worst. I'm allergic.KILMEADE: You can't go to Miami either.GUILFOYLE: I know. Cancel that.KILMEADE: The security workers, they say the training we got was very quick. That doesn't make me feel better, Juan.WILLIAMS: No. And of course, and just -- I understand there were ten people arrested who were involved with some kind of ISIS activity in Brazil. So you have ten people. Now the judge said they were amateurs and all the rest. But still, when you see the propaganda magazine -- by the way, that thing must have been rushed to press, because what they've got in there is Khan talking about Trump and the whole controversy right there.KILMEADE: Absolutely.WILLIAMS: So this is weird to me. They rushed to press with this?  They're having success, apparently, because they put so much of it in Portuguese to get to people, especially alienated poor people in Brazil.GUILFOYLE: Smart move.KILMEADE: The whole mountainside is full of them.BOLLING: Can I recommend we don't go for another Olympics? Can we not...KILMEADE: Don't...BOLLING: No, here is why I say it.GUILFOYLE: Really?KILMEADE: Because we are such a target. Nothing would make a terrorist happier...WILLIAMS: We have our own security...KILMEADE: ... to pull off a terrorist plot in an Olympic event where the whole world is watching. I just think for now...GUILFOYLE: We're the best at security. Where else are you going to put it?KILMEADE: And also the best athletes.WILLIAMS: As Dana points out, one crazy nut job to walk through...GUILFOYLE: Even an amateur can land a solid sucker punch.KILMEADE: I just love the fact that we're being sarcastic that this magazine comes out and says ""Why we hate you. Why we hate you, West."" And by the way, the biggest thing that they find laughable is that they say Islam is a religion of peace. It is not. Because they want to wipe us out. So we don't have to have a debate or think tank. They're telling us, they hate us and they list the reasons.GUILFOYLE: Do they list climate change and the lack of an ISIS job fair?  Please check. Page 32.KILMEADE: Wait a second. Wait a second, wait a second. No, they don't list climate change.BOLLING: Not the climate?KILMEADE: Can you believe it?WILLIAMS: I can't believe it. I'll tell you that.I was just going to say remember what happened with the Israeli athletes, right? You know what? We don't stop the Olympics.BOLLING: I know.WILLIAMS: What did President Bush say? Don't let the bad guys win.BOLLING: You know Twitter's going to light up. Bolling, red, white and blue, these colors don't run. I get it. Also you guys have to be smart at some point.WILLIAMS: But don't give up.GUILFOYLE: Hang in there, Bolling.KILMEADE: Thank you. The Antoinette Robbins of ""The Five.""WILLIAMS: Thank you very much.GUILFOYLE: You survived ""The View"" today.KILMEADE: Hey, let me just say, the segment that we all study for. Eric joined the ladies of ""The View"" earlier. How did Mr. Bolling do? How did he handle the grilling, or did they embrace him in every way, shape or form. You'll find out next when Eric plays himself on this show.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: This morning I did something I've never done before. I joined the ladies of ""The View."" And it was a lot of fun. In case you missed it, here 's a quick look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-HOST, ABC'S ""THE VIEW"": Fox News host and author of ""Wake Up, America,"" Eric Bolling.BOLLING: I am so excited to be here. It's amazing.JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, ABC'S ""THE VIEW"": Before we do this, I hear you're a fan.BOLLING: You know, I watched ""The Bachelorette"" last night and in the spirit of ""The Bachelorette"" (HANDS HER A ROSE).BEHAR: Will this turn me into a Republican?BOLLING: No.GOLDBERG: You are a Trump supporter. You've been very vocal about that.  Why is he your choice for president?BOLLING: Well, first of all, right now he's my choice, because I think he'll be a better president than Hillary Clinton. We're down to two choices.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right. Exactly.BEHAR: But why?BOLLING: Here's why. So right now, the Supreme Court is 4-4. It's conservative/liberal right now, 4-4. Hillary Clinton has said she will put a liberal on the Supreme Court. And a lot of things, I think, going forward -- I wrote the book about -- the book is a conservative road map, bringing the country back to the center, because we're being dragged so far left.(END VIDEOTAPE)BOLLING: So it was a lot of fun. Whoopi, Joy, Sarah, Jet and Sunny. They were great. Tough. Tough interview, I'll tell you, but firm and fair.  Absolutely fair. But I've got to tell you, it's like going in -- it's like Yankees going into -- into Boston at Fenway Park.KILMEADE: From where?BOLLING: The team, the fans, the audience.KILMEADE: When you're behind the scenes were they, uh-oh, here he comes?BOLLING: A couple of people.GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: Two people separately -- maybe three people separately on the staff in the back, behind the scenes said, ""Hey, just want to let you know.  I watch you guys on 'The Five' all the time.""I said, ""Don't say that too loud."" They're very --it's not very. They're very non-conservative. But they were absolutely fair. And I told people I was coming on. They were like, tweet me some advice? They were like, ""Cancel. Run. Don't do it. Wear a cup. Your book is selling. You don't really need to do this.""PERINO: The roses, that was a nice touch. Whose idea was that?BOLLING: I merely -- last night, I'm watching ""The Bachelor"" with Adrienne, and I'm like, ""You know what? I'm going to bring roses.""PERINO: That was a nice touch.KILMEADE: Roses. It's the network, too. Same network, ABC network. And Joy really embraced the flower.BOLLING: People said, ""Joy will be so mean to you. Be prepared for Joy.""GUILFOYLE: So nice.BOLLING: Joy and Whoopi were absolutely fabulous. Jedediah was there.  Great to have her.GUILFOYLE: You just want to be there, right?BOLLING: Typically you wouldn't think that from...PERINO: They play us on ""The Family Feud""?BOLLING: Wouldn't that be fun?

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, a new national uproar after police shoot a suspect near Baltimore and touch off a huge wave of controversial media coverage.  Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly.  Many Americans awoke to the heartbreaking news today that a young black mother Korryn Gaines had been killed and her young son wounded after a nearly six-hour standoff with police on Monday.  What was missing from some of those initial reports, however, was the fact that Gaines was allegedly pointing a shotgun at the responding officers as she sat on the couch with a five- year-old child.  Police were attempting to serve arrest warrants to Gaines and a man named Kareem Courtney early Monday.  No one answered at Gaines' apartment, but the officers could hear voices inside, including those of children.  Here's how police described what happened next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES JOHNSON, CHIEF, BALTIMORE COUNTY POLICE:  They could clearly see a female that they believed to be Ms. Gaines seated on the floor, a child nearby, who immediately began to wield a shotgun around, bringing up to ready position, pointing it directly at the officers there to serve the arrest warrant.  The entire time, throughout the afternoon, she repeatedly would point the weapon at our personnel.  For hours we pleaded with her to end this peacefully.  We were concerned about the safety of the child.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Gaines was even filming off and on as those hours unfolded.  Her young son's voice still in the background as she zoomed in on the rifle of an officer who was peering in the door at one point.  And another gut- wrenching video taken during the standoff, Gaines asks her young son whether he is aware of the situation in which she has put him.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KORRYN GAINES, MOTHER:  What's happening right now?  Who's outside?UNIDENTIFIED BOY:  The police.  GAINES:  And what are they trying to do?  What are they trying to do?UNIDENTIFIED BOY:  They're trying to kill us.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  They're trying to kill us.  In moments we're joined by Pastor Wesley West and radio host Kevin Jackson on the controversy over how this thing ended and where the story has gone since.  But first tonight, we begin with Trace Gallagher, who has the details that a lot of media outlets left out.  Trace.  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, prior to the five- and-a-half hour standoff, Baltimore police were very aware of 23-year-old Korryn Gaines.  Back in March, they pulled her over with her kids for not having a car license plate.  Instead of a plate, there was a cardboard sign warning government officials not to stop her.  And when police did, it quickly got confrontational.  And Korryn Gaines videotaped it and posted parts of it on Instagram.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED OFFICER:  Why are you -- (INAUDIBLE)GAINES:  Listen.  A chance to be what?UNIDENTIFIED OFFICER:  To get out of your car with your children.  GAINES:  Sir, you're trying to steal my car.  When you put your hands on me, I promise you, you will have to murder me.  You will have to murder me.  So go ahead and get ready to do that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  Gaines was finally arrested and given a court date.  When she failed to appear, Baltimore police went to her home to serve a bench warrant.  Police say they could hear the man inside talking with her, but nobody came to the door, so they got a key from the manager, opened the door, and found Gaines sitting on the floor with a shotgun.  Police backed away, and the barricade began.  A short time later, the man inside ran out with a one-year-old baby and was arrested.  Gaines stayed in the home with her five-year-old son.  Police negotiators brought in her parents and a psychologist, saying they made every effort to get the woman to surrender.  All the while, Gaines was posting on social media, and her followers were encouraging her not to surrender.  Police filed the request with Facebook and Instagram to disable her account, but it took more than an hour.  And this is the final Instagram post.  Watch again.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KORRYN GAINES, MOTHER:  What's happening right now?  Who's outside?UNIDENTIFIED BOY:  The police.  GAINES:  And what are they trying to do?  What are they trying to do?UNIDENTIFIED BOY:  They're trying to kill us.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  Police say, when Gaines again pointed her shotgun at officers through the door, it prompted the exchange of gunfire.  One shot by police, two shots from inside the apartment, three more shots by police.  Korryn Gaines was killed.  Her five-year-old son hit in the arm.  It remains unclear if the boy was hit by police gunfire or by his mother's.  The boy is listed in good condition tonight -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Wow.  Trace, thank you.  Joining me now, criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor Mark Eiglarsh, and criminal rights and defense Attorney Andell Brown.  Wow.   Mark?MARK EIGLARSH, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  All her.  All her.  Anybody who dares point the finger at law enforcement is either being intellectually dishonest or somehow really doesn't know the facts in this case.  They were overly cautious.  They could have shot her right away when they came in and then held back.  Six hours, they waited.  And when they came in, both with the words that she used, I will kill you, coupled with the action, not putting down the shotgun, they had to take action.  She caused her death.  KELLY:  Andell, do you agree?ANDELL BROWN, CRIMINAL RIGHTS AND DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  In a situation like this, a picture's worth a thousand words and a video was priceless.   Here we have the police account of the events, but we also have police accounts in the Walter Scott case, Laquan McDonald case, Tamir Rice case, where facts that were reported did not match up once we had a video.  When we have citizens who feel the need like in the Philando Castile or the Alton Sterling to record interactions with police because the body cameras fell off, they aren't working or whatever the case may be, it shows we have an issue with the trust and transparency and accountability.  EIGLARSH:  That's not what she asked you.  KELLY:  This is her with a gun.  This is her with a shotgun, Mark Eiglarsh.  I mean, that's on video.  BROWN:  That's not what we're told.  That's not what we see?KELLY:  What?EIGLARSH:  So, what are you suggesting, Andell?  Are you going to manufacture facts?BROWN:  What I am suggesting is --  (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)KELLY:  I'm looking at it right now.  BROWN:  They should be using body cameras in this case.  KELLY:  They just got the body cameras a couple of weeks ago.  They're implementing that in Baltimore.  BROWN:  Well, great.  We need to see what happened.  That's all I can say.  KELLY:  How much more can we see?EIGLARSH:  Because I've seen police reports that turned out not to be true once we saw the video.  KELLY:  But, Mark Eiglarsh, we're seeing -- we are seeing.  This is video from the moment this went down.  EIGLARSH:  We can play Andell's generic game.  KELLY:  Let Mark answer that.  EIGLARSH:  Hold on.  Hold on.  Andell, we'll go with what you're saying.   You can throw out that generic comment all day long.  We'll never know because we weren't there, we haven't seen reports, and sometimes reports are wrong, you're correct.  But here's the question.  Based upon what they're reporting, are you conceding that this was a justified shooting?BROWN:  Mark, what I'm saying is, I'm not just going to go with what - -  EIGLARSH:  The answer is yes or no.  BROWN:  When you go into a court of law, Mark -- you don't control this interview.  When we go into a court of law, we make sure we're very sure before we take someone's freedom.  EIGLARSH:  You just can't take a word, can you?BROWN:  We make sure we go through many steps before we take someone's life.  It was a hypothetical.  KELLY:  Okay.  Hold on a second, guys.  Hold on a second.  BROWN:  The people deserve to see and evaluate whether --  KELLY:  Hold on.  To Andell's point.  Okay.  To Andell -- hold on.  To your point, to Andell's point -- the video of her loading up that gun was apparently from two weeks earlier.  It wasn't this.  This was two weeks earlier.  It wasn't in the moment that she had the confrontation with the police, who say she did have a long gun, who you can hear discussing with her son on the video that they're -- she believes they're trying to kill her.  And there's a question about her mental state, Mark.  I mean, I don't know whether this woman was okay emotionally or mentally, and the police would not confirm whether she had a history of mental health issues.  But here she is just a couple of weeks earlier when she had the confrontation with police.  She was pulled over.  She didn't have a license plate.  She considered herself a sovereign citizen.  She didn't recognize the authority of the U.S. law enforcement agents.  She demanded to see their authority cards, and this is a confrontation.  This is a piece of tape from back then.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GAINES:  You know they're talking about stealing my vehicle.  They tell you get out this car, don't take your seat belt off.  You do not get out this car.  Do you understand?UNIDENTIFIED BOY:  Yes.  GAINES:  You better fight their asses.  Fight them.  Do you hear me?UNIDENTIFIED BOY:  Yes.  GAINES:  And they will have to kill me today.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, nobody wants to kill you.  GAINES:  They will have to.  They will have to, in front of my children and everything.  (Bleep) Burn in hell, all you all pigs.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  So, she's telling her child he had to get out, I think it's her five-year-old, he needs to get out and fight the  police, that they're going to have to kill her to get her out of the car.  The officer asked for her license and registration.  She refuses to show it.  She demands to see his authority card.  He shows it to her.  So the question is whether this person was of sound mind and whether the police, if that is the case, had an obligation to do more to not engage in a shoot-out with this person.  EIGLARSH:  Okay.  Here's my take on her.  I will defend her right to spew her outrageous and offensive speech, even y'all pigs like she said at the end.  She has a constitutional right to say that.  But her constitutional rights end when she begins to resist and obstruct officers as she did in that scenario.  But, worse, when she shows violence, when she has a gun aimed at law enforcement officers, who didn't wake up wanting to kill anybody that day.  They just wanted to go home to  their families.   And she created a scenario that led to her tragic demise.  KELLY:  Go ahead, Andell.  I'll give you the last word.  BROWN:  In this circumstance, absolutely a tragedy whenever someone loses life or liberty.  In this country where life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness are high ideals, we take it very seriously.  So I just want to make sure that in every one of these instances, we have the transparency and accountability to keep our government honest from the cops on the street all the way up to the White House.  That's what the people deserve, and that's what we want.  KELLY:  Great to see you both.  EIGLARSH:  Same here, Megyn.  KELLY:  Well, as we mentioned earlier, the response we're seeing to the story seems to be largely influenced by the fact that many of the headlines people have been reading make no mention of the fact that Ms. Gaines was allegedly armed and threatening to kill these police.  Vox declared, quote, ""Baltimore County police shot Korryn Gaines and a five- year-old was caught in the crossfire.""  Think Progress, quote, ""Police fatally shoot woman holding five-year-old boy in her lap.""  Sean King at the New York Daily News took things a step further suggesting, ""Cynicism toward Korryn Gains, Baltimore mom killed by cops illustrates power of white privilege.""  And now in a now deleted tweet, The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery said, quote, ""Every fatal police shooting by definition is a summary execution.""  Pastor Westley West of Faith and Power Ministries is a member of Black Lives Matter.  And Kevin Jackson is a Fox News contributor and executive director of TheBlackSphere.net.  Great to see you both.  Pastor, do you defend those headlines?  Do you think those headlines are misleading in light of what we are told are the facts?PASTOR WESTLEY WEST, FAITH EMPOWERED MINISTRIES:  Well, I can't say it's misleading.  I would say right now there is a story behind it all.  Again, after what just happened here in Baltimore with the death of Freddie Gray and now this, this shows that, no, none of that is misleading at all.  I stand behind everything that was been put out today in her benefit.  KELLY:  Okay.  So, if you believe that, then what should the cops have done if they went to this person's house, she skipped out on her court appearance.  They have to execute a bench warrant.  That's how it works.  She wouldn't let them in.  They got the landlord to open the door.  She's sitting there with a long gun and a five-year-old on her lap threatening them.  What should they have done?WEST:  Well, again, I think that they have -- they said they had backed down, which I don't believe they backed down at all.  Here's a young lady, again, who shows that there has been some harassment by the Police Department.  At this point in time, they should have more -- her family members come to the scene --  KELLY:  The copped called them.  The cops called them to come help.  WEST:  We're talking about -- can I say this real quickly, Kelly?  We're talking about the same police officers that have not issued a statement.  Why are you giving part of the statement?  I need the full statement.  I need the videos.  Why haven't these police officers have body cameras on them?  I need to see this.  I need to really see this.  Don't tell me -- don't tell me what they said.  I need to see this for myself.  KELLY:  Okay.  WEST:  Where is the record?KELLY:  The whole thing is not caught on a cop's body camera.  They say they just got the mandate for these a few weeks ago in the whole wake of Freddie Gray and everything else.  Kevin, your thoughts.  KEVIN JACKSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  This is the more ridiculousness of the left.  And it just goes to show why America can't improve and particularly black America.  Look, this is cut and dry.  The police did everything they could to not hurt this young lady.  And by the way, the fault goes with the young lady who would have two children in her home and not surrender to the police and get everything worked out, no matter what.  They're not saying anything about that.  I'll tell you something else that won't be mentioned.  Thirty five people who were killed last month in Baltimore, nobody's going to remember the name Javon Guy (ph).  He was shot and killed by other black people.  This is patently ridiculous.  America is sick of it.  This young lady always --  WEST:  Yes, America is --  KELLY:  Hold on, Pastor.  Hold on.  JACKSON:  Just be quite.  KELLY:  Go ahead, Kevin.JACKSON:  This young lady had a problem already with police, and it was already documented.  WEST:  Wow.  JACKSON:  She said it and you all are going to have to kill me in front of my kids.  What more -- now, look, she probably had some sort of a mental problem.  Who knows?  And nobody is saying she deserved to die per se.  But everything that could have prevented her death, she could have done.  And for this attorney and this pastor to sit here and -- to say these things is detrimental to the black community.  You're teaching kids hate.  You're teaching the black community the wrong lessons here.  KELLY:  Go ahead, Pastor.  WEST:  Listen, at some point in time, the police have to be held accountable for their actions.  Again, I do hear you.  I do say -- I hear you saying that they had done everything.  They actually didn't.  What happened to the tasers?  What happened to the sleep gas?  Here is a five- year-old.  Let's hear this.  A five-year-old little boy in a home with --  KELLY:  She put the child on her lap.  WEST:  Come on, this was just an incident in Baltimore where there was a hostage situation.  This man did not die, and he had seven people that were held hostage at a Burger King.  JACKSON:  You know, you can yell about this all you want.  Here's the real interesting part.  Here's the interesting part, Pastor.  Nothing has changed.  It's the same --  WEST:  The five-year-old boy did not deserve to see his mother shot and killed.  KELLY:  That's true.  Pastor, everyone can agree on that.  That five- year-old boy should not have been in that situation.  The reason he was is because of his mother who chose to put him.  Whether she was in the right or wrong, she never should have had that child on her lap, never, never.   I'll give you the last word, Kevin.  I got to go.  JACKSON:  Megyn, the --  WEST:  I can say what I want.  I can say what I want.  KELLY:  You can.WEST:  I can say what I want.  KELLY:  Go for it.  And you've been given an opportunity.  My only point is --WEST:  Kelly, quickly.   (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  No responsible mother would put her five-year-old child on her lap while she's holding a long gun and engaging in a shootout with police.  WEST:  I agree.  But, Kelly, for her to say that, I'll kill you -- for her to say, I'll kill you, she can say what she wants.  KELLY:  I understood.  I agree, but there are consequences.  (CROSSTALK)I got to go.  I got to go.  I got to go.  Great to see you both.  Breaking tonight, The Wall Street Journal just went up with a stunning story.  It reports that the Obama administration shipped $400 million in cash to the Iranians.  At the very same time that Iran was releasing those four American hostages.  Remember that?  The White House said at the time, no, we didn't -- we didn't pay money.  And even now they say, no.  There's no quid pro quo.  No, no.  But the critics are calling this a ransom payment, which would be directly contrary to U.S. policy.   We're not allowed to pay ransom to get hostages back because that generally leads to more hostage-taking.  This story is just breaking.  We're still gathering the details and we'll going to have more for you very shortly.  Plus, with the dust settling from these crazy primaries and this convention now behind this, Glenn Beck is back for the first time in months to talk Trump, Clinton and the 2016 race ahead.  And then we have brand new details in the killing that shocked the country.  JonBenet Ramsey's brother breaking his silence 20 years after his sister's unsolved murder.  Stay tuned.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Developing tonight, an eventful 24 hours for Donald Trump just keeps rolling with a series of events getting media attention today.   Earlier today, the GOP nominee surprised voters at a Virginia rally by requesting that a crying baby be removed from the crowd.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Actually, I was only kidding.  You can get the baby out of here.  That's all right.  Don't worry.  I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  At that same event, a veteran handed over his prestigious Purple Heart to Mr. Trump, who joked that he's always wanted the award but that it's much easier to come by as a gift.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KHIZR KHAN, GOLD STAR PARENT:  You're asking Americans to trust you with their future.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Then there was this moment, which you've heard about.  Trump also spoke out about his ongoing feud with the Muslim family who took the stage at the DNC and talked about how their son gave his life for America while fighting in Iraq.  Trump saying he has no regrets about questioning the Khans and specifically wondering why the mother didn't speak.  She later said she was too grief-stricken.  Also adding to a recent bout of campaign controversy, the answer Donald Trump gave when asked how he would want his daughter Ivanka to handle sexual harassment, quote, ""I would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case.""  Joining me now with all of this, Glenn Beck.  Founder of the Blaze and author of the brand new book -- hold on, hold on, let me plug your book.   ""Liars: How Progressives Exploit Our Fears for Power and Control.""  Hi, Glenn.  GLENN BECK, AUTHOR, ""LIARS"":  Yes.  KELLY:  So, your thoughts on those five items that Mr. Trump has generated today.  BECK:  Quite honestly, I think, if I may take it another direction, I think that the media and America is so myopic looking at this cult of personality between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump that we're missing the real story, and that is -- and I urge people to look this guy up.  It's the same kind of feeling and the same kind of research we did when we said there's a caliphate coming.  Russia is trying to destabilize our political system.  Dugan, who is a main adviser of Putin and a very dangerous man thinks that Hitler just didn't go far enough.  He's the guy who advised Putin to go into the Crimea.  He is now giving speeches in Russia where he is saying we are infiltrated into the political system.  He is thinking that Donald Trump is the answer, not for -- I don't think he actually cares and, I don't think that either Hillary or Donald are involved in this in any way, but what they're trying to do is seed revolution on the streets.  Those are their words, and this is what we should be talking about.  This game is going to go on through November, and I don't know how it ends.  But I do believe based on their words only, that Russia is trying to take down Hillary Clinton, trying to destabilize our election, and foment revolution on our streets.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  You may be on to something there because General John Allen told me last week when he was endorsing Hillary Clinton that in his experience, the Russians study our elections very closely --  BECK:  Yes.KELLY: -- and they study our candidates very closely.  Almost from an anthropological standpoint to understand their psyche.  BECK:  Russia is trying to do to us right now what we did to them under Ronald Reagan.  We have the same kind of things in play.  We collapsed the Soviet Union.  Putin is going to pay us back, and that's exactly what he's trying to do right now.  And the media and our politicians need to grow up and start talking about it.  The one politician that should be on every channel tonight -- and I'm not a fan of this man's policies -- is Mitt Romney.  Mitt Romney called this, and everybody mocked him.  KELLY:  Mm-hmm.  BECK:  We are about to find out that Russia is our biggest -- our biggest foe and our biggest nightmare.  KELLY:  Yes.  That was when President Obama said that Russia called and they want to get their 1980 foreign policy back, I think something like that.  Let me ask you this.  Because there's other news to discuss tonight.  And specifically, I want to ask you about this, the latest poll showed Hillary Clinton got a big bump out of her convention.  She's now beating Donald Trump in at least three polls.  NBC has her with an eight-point lead.  CBS has her with a seven-point lead.  CNN has her with a nine-point lead over Trump.  Now, back in May, you said, I'm telling you, Donald Trump is going to win this election.  Given those polls, do you stand by that?BECK:  I don't want to -- I mean I have no idea because I've been wrong every step of the way in this election.  I will tell you this.  As I watched both the -- you know, in my book, ""Liars,"" I talk about what are the tools that progressives use to convince us of these lies?  It was quite amazing.  One of the first tools is fear.  The GOP ran high on fear.  But so did the DNC.  The DNC made it the fear of the Donald Trump, but they did something that the Republicans didn't do.  They told a very well-crafted story all the way through that we're better than this, that -- I mean honestly if I wasn't informed, if I was somebody who didn't know who Clinton was, I didn't recognize Marxist language, I would have watched that and thought, well, those are the people I want to be like.  Those people.  I like those people, if I didn't listen to their policies and I was uninformed.  They're using hope the way that Barack Obama used hope and change.  The thing that is going to play a real factor here is Russia.   What happens to Russia?KELLY:  All right.  I got to ask you this because you were a big supporter of Ted Cruz's.  When I found out he was speaking at the Democratic National Convention, I gave him a hard time on the show, he wasn't here, but you know, behind his back.  BECK:  I know.KELLY:  I mean, he could see it because --  BECK:  I almost Facebook you because I was angry at you.  KELLY:  I know.  Well, you know, I was saying, isn't it hypocritical of these politicians to get up there after they say, I hate this person and then speak on their behalf.  And you know, he and you were sort of saying, why don't you just hold on?  Why don't you just hold your horses, ma'am?  BECK:  Right.KELLY:  And then he got up at the Republican National Convention and shocked the world with this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Please don't stay home in November.  If you love our country and love your children as much as I know that you do, stand and speak and vote your conscience.  Vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  So I was wrong in the prediction of how that was going to go, and I want to ask you what you thought of the moment because, of course, he was excoriated by so many as committing political suicide.  BECK:  Yes.  I think if he -- you know, if he had to do it all over again and he asked my opinion, which he didn't, I would say just don't -- just don't show up.  Just go away for a while.  However, I think that it gave a lot of people courage.  You know, Bernie Sanders did the exact opposite, which is what all the people of the GOP said they wanted Ted Cruz to do.  But soon as Bernie did that, everybody on both sides of the aisle said huge mistake for him.  He sold out his values.  His people no longer trust him.  I think he's the only guy with any credibility who did the tough thing.  When you saw that last 90 seconds of that speech, that was not easy in that cave.  KELLY:  Ted Cruz?BECK:  Yes.  When Ted Cruz stood there, he stood there, and he spoke his principles, and he spoke them with respect and decency, and he said vote your conscience.  Vote for the guy who's going to follow the constitution.  It's ironic that everybody in the crowd was booing him as if somehow or another they know that Donald Trump's not going to follow the constitution?KELLY:  Mm-hmm.  BECK:  It was foolishly played on the RNC side.   KELLY:  They wanted the full-on, you know, vote for Donald Trump.   Glenn, it's always a pleasure.  Well, check out the book ""Liars.""  It's easy to remember.  ""Liars: How Progressives Exploit Our Fears for Power and Control.""  Liars.BECK:  Thank you, Megyn.KELLY:  He says, ""Liars.""  It's great to see you, Glenn.  All the best.  Good to have like the pithy title.  More details coming in right now on our breaking news.  The Wall Street Journal reporting tonight that the Obama administration shipped$400 million in cash to the Iranians.  We're talking big, big piles of bills.  They made sure it wasn't in U.S. currency.  We'll get to why.  At the very same time Iran completely, coincidentally was releasing four Americans who had been held hostage.  We have new reaction from the White House just breaking, and we've got the details on this story you'll be hearing a lot about tomorrow.  Also tonight, a first in American presidential politics as President Obama tries to torpedo Donald Trump's White House hopes.  Will it make a difference?  Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson and Katie Pavlich are here, next.  Don't go away.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: Welcome back to ""The Kelly File,"" everybody. In what we believe is a first in American politics, while sitting presidents often campaign for their candidate, president Obama today went a big step further by calling on his political rivals to reject their own party's nominee for president. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Yes, I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president. I said so last week, and he keeps on proving it. And that's not just my opinion. That is the opinion of the many prominent Republicans. There has to come a point at which you say enough.The alternative is that the entire party, the Republican Party, effectively endorses and validates the positions that are being articulated by Mr. Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Katrina Pierson, national spokesperson for the Trump campaign, and Katie Pavlich, a Fox News contributor and news editor of Townhall.com, great to see you both. So, Kat, what did you make of the president specifically weighing in and calling Donald Trump unfit today?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Well, what else is he going to say, Megyn? There's still a little bit of the American dream left to kill and he wants Hillary to do it. This is coming from the same guy who ran in 2008, probably one of the most qualified people to ever run for office, never have run anything or created a single job, and it's shown throughout his tenure.They have killed millions of jobs with Obamacare, now in an economy that's $2.2 trillion under average and single handedly destabilized the Middle East, and with the help of Hillary Clinton, unleash global terrorism.KELLY: OK, so Katie, what we're seeing though is more and more Republicans kind of on the same track with president Obama. I mean just today we saw a New York representative come out and say, I'm not going to vote for him. I'm going to vote for Hillary Clinton -- Representative Richard Hanna. Governor Christie came out on the Khan comments -- the Khan family comments and said they were inappropriate. Paul Ryan said that we're in a fight right now for the soul of our party. What do you make of it?KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think that we should listen to president Obama as he lectures us about incivility and rhetoric considering the past eight years and the things he's said. But on that discussion, look, there's a lot of Republicans who have come out against what Donald Trump said about Captain Khan's family and rightly so. And Mr. Trump needs to realize that this isn't simply about what he's saying, and that because he is not a typical politician, he can say whatever he wants and get away with it.But the fact is that other Republicans who are politicians running in tight races in the Senate and the House can't afford to be tied to those comments. And on that point, Donald Trump has his base locked up. He has the people who are going to vote for him voting for him. They're not going to change their mind no matter what. They said in polling across the board. What does it do for Donald Trump to be attacking the family of an American war hero at this point? And why can't he...KELLY: Why is that Katrina, I mean, I know he says he's a counter-puncher, but he has to be a smart -- he has to be a smart politician to win the presidency. And is it smart to go after the Khan family in the way he did?PIERSON: Well, first let's clarify. Donald Trump didn't attack anyone. He simply responded to the attacks against him. And secondly this congressman you spoke of has like a 31 percent rating on the Heritage Action scorecard, so he's essentially been voting with Democrats the whole time. And let's not pretend that these recent comments is what's really fueling the fire for some of these Republicans.I mean, these are the same Republicans who haven't been following the party platform for decades, which is exactly why Mr. Trump was so successful. And if they want to continue to insult 13.5 million Republican voters, they should go right ahead because they won't forget that.KELLY: But you know, she didn't really answer the question, Katie, about whether it was smart of Donald Trump, even if it was a, ""counterattack"" against a Gold Star family, is that smart? And has that helped Donald Trump?PAVLICH: Well, it's not smart, and Donald Trump, in my opinion, did attack the Khan family by saying that Mr. Khan had no right to criticize him when his son died. In fact, for his right to say whatever he wanted on a national stage despite whether it's political. And you know what, Megyn, Dana Perino tells this great story in her book about how president Bush when he was at Walter Reed, he was visiting families and there was a mother there who was going to be a Gold Star mother as her son was sitting in a hospital bed, and she was angry.And she said some words to president Bush, and he left that hospital saying, in the helicopter, on the way out, with tears on his face, ""That mama sure was mad at me and I don't blame her."" And that's how presidents lead, and that's what the attitude should be moving forward, and it's unfortunate that Donald Trump can't take that position.KELLY: And just in case you're wondering, the name of Dana's book is ""And the Good News is...""PIERSON: Yeah, but the difference here though, Katie, is that Donald Trump had nothing to do with the war. He didn't send anybody into war. In fact, he's been against the war. Hillary sent...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But it doesn't make a difference. We don't attack the family. He's being attacked by Trump for being indecent.PIERSON: No, but he didn't attack the family, that's my point. He was talking about being attacked.KELLY: Why did he ask whether the mother was allowed to speak, Katrina?PIERSON: Because if you're looking at the segment, they talk about the reports that he has seen, and this father apparently has been...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: All right, I got to go because I have another panel waiting.PIERSON: No, you're absolutely right, but...KELLY: I'm sorry. They do that and it's kind of rude but we do have another panel sitting here. While this fight between Donald Trump and the Khan family has been spinning out over the last four days, a huge number of people have been piling on the candidate. But now there's a new letter that's gone viral from the combat vet questioning Mr. Khan's remarks and his defense of Democrats.He writes in part, quote, ""Does it matter whether Mr. Trump has sacrificed nothing and no one?"" That's a quote from Mr. Khan. ""Has Mrs. Clinton sacrificed for this nation? How about Mr. Obama?"" He goes on, ""As a father I cannot imagine the pain you must feel"" -- this is to Mr. Khan. But his sacrifice, meaning Khan's son, is his own. He was not forced to serve.The man behind that letter joins us now. Chris Mark served as a U.S. Marine and Navy officer. He was also a Scout and a sniper who deployed overseas. And Howie Kurtz is here too. He's been following the media aspect of this. Great to see you both. Chris...CHRIS MARK, FORMER U.S. MARINE AND NAVY OFFICER: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: It's an interesting point because Mr. Khan wanted to know if Donald Trump had sacrificed and Trump came out and said, ""You know, I've sacrificed plenty. I've worked hard,"" and, man, did he get hit for answering the question that was posed. Go ahead.MARK: Yeah. So, I thought it was a bit exploitive of him to say that and simply being there and, you know, forgive me for saying this, but kind of bringing his son, who by all accounts is a true American hero. I mean, nobody is ever, you know, disputing that into this, you know, political debate. You know, there are only two criteria to be president in the United States, to be a U.S. citizen and 35 years old.So, I have a little bit of -- take exception of the fact when people say, you know, what have you sacrificed? The fact whether or not you have or have not sacrificed in defense of this nation doesn't imbue you with any additional privileges. And that's really what compelled this blog post.KELLY: And you talk in your open letter about you feel that he was paraded, that Mr. and Mrs. Khan were paraded on the stage by Democrats. What do you mean by that because, you know, I think they would respond by saying, we wanted to be there. We object to Donald Trump and his presidency, and we wanted our voices heard.MARK: Yeah. You know, let me be honest, Megyn. After watching the Khans again and re-reading his comments without the context of them being at the DNC and without all of the fanfare and the emotion and everything, you know, I would like to kind of revise that statement. I think that they did that. They had an objective, but I don't think they were necessarily paraded any longer.And again, I had to, you know, review my comments without the context of them being in the DNC. Again, I think it was either exploitive on the part of the DNC to put them out there. And again, if you look at Mrs. Smith from the RNC, she was taken to task for going out and talking about her son dying in Benghazi, and it seems like the Khans are being treated a bit differently. So, it's either exploitive on the DNC's part and I think it's a little bit opportunistic.KELLY: OK, that's where I want to pick it up with Howie. Do you think there's been a difference, Howie? Does the coverage prove that there's been a difference between the media's reaction to Pat Smith, mother of a Benghazi victim, and to the Khans?HOWIE KURTZ, ""MEDIABUZZ"" HOST: Absolutely, it is not even close. And by the way, they both committed political acts by speaking at political conventions, and they both spoke from the heart and I respect their right to speak out on behalf of their fallen sons. But if you look at the media coverage -- and, yes, Donald Trump fueled it in the case of Khizr Khan by criticizing the family.But even before he said a word, the media rocket fuel embracing the Khan message, almost as if as their own -- front page of ""The New York Times,"" putting them on ""Meet the Press,"" on the ""Today Show,"" all over cable -- showed that Khan's message and his accusation against Trump as an anti- Muslim bigot had a resonance for most of the mainstream media that Patricia Smith's very heartfelt comments in Cleveland did not.KELLY: And what do you think the reason for that is?KURTZ: I think, you know, when you strip it all away -- and, yes, you know, Patricia Smith had made this point in interviews many times, so she wasn't breaking news, and the mitigating factors. But when you really come down to it, I think the consensus in the mainstream media is that Patricia Smith was being unfair in personally blaming Hillary Clinton for the death of her son.And that Khizr Khan, while not blaming obviously Trump for what happened during the Iraq war, was speaking for many Americans who don't like Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslim immigrants so, a different -- it had more resonance here.KELLY: But her story is more personal. I mean, she is alleging that she was lied to directly about her son's death by Hillary Clinton. You know, the Khan family is just objecting to Donald trump's policies and his statements. They're not alleging a dishonest personal interaction with the casket of their son steps away, which is that's why we put Pat Smith on the air, and you can think whatever you want about Pat Smith or Mr. and Mrs. Khan, but they were given a platform.They were given a platform. We invited the Khan family on here. So far, no luck, but they've been all over media and hopefully they'll come here eventually. It's great to see you both.KURTZ: Thanks Megyn.MARK: Thank you.KELLY: Up next, Mark Thiessen is here on the breaking news reports out of Iran that the Obama administration shipped $400 million in cash to Iran at the very same time that country was releasing four Americans who had been held hostage.Plus, 20 years after the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, her brother -- her brother is finally breaking his silence. We'll have a full report.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, the White House just responded to a stunning new report out of the ""Wall Street Journal"" saying the Obama administration secretly airlifted $400 million in cash to Tehran at the very same time four American hostages were released. Critics are calling it a ransom payment and we are not supposed to pay ransoms.The White House is denying that, saying this cash had nothing to do with the hostages but was part of a payment the U.S. agreed to going all the way back to the time the shah was still in power. Mark Thiessen is a Fox News contributor and a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Mark, so, I mean, was it a quid pro quo?MARK THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Of course it was a quid pro quo. Their denials are completely laughable. I mean, first of all, ""The Wall Street Journal"" reports that U.S. officials admitted to the journal that Iranian negotiators on the hostage deal were actually asking for this money in exchange as a sign that they were making progress. So, this was literally a specific request the Iranian hostage negotiators were making.And second of all, if it wasn't a ransom deal, why the secrecy? Why send an unmarked plane with wooden pallets filled with Swiss Francs and other non- U.S. currency in the dead of night to arrive in Tehran just by the way, by coincidence on the very day that the hostages are released? And why keep it secret from Congress and the American people?I mean where they perhaps worried that the American people would be upset to learn that they were evading U.S. sanctions law because it is illegal under U.S. sanctions law to give cash to the Iranian regime, and they were giving them hard currency that they can use to fund terrorism, support the Assad regime in Syria, and advance their nuclear program. I think Americans would be pretty upset to learn about it as they probably are tonight.KELLY: So why is it a bad idea to pay ransoms, and why do you think we did it if that's what we did?THIESSEN: Well, the reason it's a bad idea to pay ransoms is because it incentivizes the kidnapping of Americans. President Obama sat down in the oval office and said to himself, how can I come up with a policy that will incentivize Iran and other countries to kidnap American citizens around the world, this would be the policy we did? And guess what, it's worked.Since he made that cash payment, Iran has taken more Americans hostage and demanded more money. Since the payments were made, they've taken two more American -- Iranian-Americans hostage. They've taken dual nationals from France, from Canada, and the U.K. and second...KELLY: We're coming up on our break Mark. I got to leave it at that, but there's a lot more on this story and we'll continue it.THIESSEN: All right.KELLY: By the way, again, the White House is denying this. They're saying there's no connection. Up next, the very latest on JonBenet Ramsey's brother speaking out.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, for the first time the brother of murdered beauty pageant princess, little JonBenet Ramsey, now breaking his silence. Burke was 9 years old when his sister was brutally murdered, and their parents quickly became the prime suspects for a time. Trace Gallagher live in L.A. with the latest.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, all the investigative records and statements indicate that when 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey suffered a skull fracture and was strangled somewhere inside the Ramsey home, her 9-year-old brother Burke was soundly sleeping inside his room. In fact, in 2008, two years after Patsy Ramsey died of ovarian cancer, all three members of the Ramsey family were cleared of any wrongdoing.And yet in 2010, 14 years after the murder, Boulder police wanted to speak with Burke Ramsey. At the time, the family attorney called it harassment and Burke Ramsey refused the offer. It's unclear exactly what investigators were trying to unlock in Burke's memory, but now Dr. Phil tells ""The Kelly File"" that his interview will have, quote, ""shocking, never before heard details about the case.""And there are many unanswered details like no forced entry, no footprints in the snow. A ransom note written on a piece of paper inside the home, just to name a few. Somebody certainly killed JonBenet Ramsey, and we will soon get information we have likely never heard, Megyn.KELLY: Wow. Fascinating. I'll be watching that one. Trace, thank you. We'll be right back. Don't go away.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So we're closing in on 2 million Twitter followers @megynkelly. Why don't you help us go over the top and we will just happen to deliver $400 million in cash, and it will have nothing -- it won't be related at all.
