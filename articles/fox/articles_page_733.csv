This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight with less than 10 hours to go from the first votes in the next critical primaries, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is blasting his rivals as pathetic as they join forces in an attempt to block his path to the Republican nomination.Good evening and welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. We are now just hours away from the battle for the east as voters in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island head to the polls. While Donald Trump is expected to do very well tomorrow night, that is not what people are talking about tonight. Hours ago, Trump unloading on Senator Ted Cruz and Governor John Kasich. Yesterday their campaigns announcing that they will work together to defeat Donald Trump in some of the upcoming primary contests. It will start next week's Indiana primary where Governor Kasich is helping clear the way for Senator Cruz to take Trump head on. Here are both of the candidates today. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The John Kasich campaign announced that they are pulling out of Indiana. Leaving this as a direct one-on-one choice for the people of Indiana between our campaign and Donald Trump.GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't see this as any big deal, other than the fact that I'm not going to spend resources in Indiana. He is not going to spend them in other places. So what?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Tonight, Donald Trump with a response of his own.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Lying Ted announced that he can't win by himself. He cannot do it. You know, he is a choker. He cannot do it. So he said let me form a partnership which I call -- what do we call it? Go ahead. Go ahead. What do we call it? Let me form, it's called collusion, folks.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In moments, we will be joined by former presidential candidate Herman Cain and editor of TheDailyWire.com Ben Shapiro. But first, on how this strategy will take shape over the coming weeks.Chris Stirewalt who is our Fox News digital politics editor. So, I mean, at first it was like I hate that guy. I'm not going to work with him. And now it's like Cruz and Kasich sitting in a tree.(LAUGHTER)I mean, it's finely dawned on them that, I mean, Trump has a point. They cannot win on their own.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, that's true. And these kinds of things aren't entirely uncommon. We remember when Donald Trump colluded. It's not collusion but when he teamed up with Chris Christie to stuff Marco Rubio in a locker in New Hampshire which was an enormous help to Trump.KELLY: He was little so it was easy.STIREWALT: Just put him in there.KELLY: All right. But this kind of stuff happens. The question is, is it effective? Certainly there were times earlier in the cycle where candidates could have teamed up. If Jeb Bush, my God, at any number of points had a chance to have done something effective in this way, Rubio might have had a chance at an earlier point. They are down to the final pairing, is there enough them in Cruz and Kasich together? Are there enough votes left? There is two issues delegates and momentum. Trump wants the momentum. He wants the narrative that says he can't be stopped. And he is fighting a crooked, corrupt, disgusting roach-food eating Republican Party and that -- and what Ted Cruz and John Kasich have to worry about is, survive that narrative, get as many delegates as you can and fight them on the --KELLY: Speaking of the food eating issue. I want to show the viewers what you're talking about because Donald Trump came out today and hit John Kasich in a very interesting way. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.(LAUGHTER)I'm always telling my young son Barren, and I'm always with my kids. All of them. I would say, children, small little bites. Small. This guy takes a pancake and is he shoving it in his mouth. It's disgusting.(END VIDEO CLIP)(LAUGHTER)KELLY: This was a reference to Kasich earlier. You know, the viewers can make up their own mind about whether he ate appropriately. But what does this say about the race at this point, Stirewalt?STIREWALT: That we are all taking crazy pills. I don't know. What does it say about the race at this point?KELLY: Nothing.STIREWALT: It's nothing. But it is a remarkable thing to say. And Kasich is going to miss out on all the corn on the cob that he could have had if he went to Indiana.KELLY: Let's be thankful for that.STIREWALT: Well, he will miss out on that. And the Cruz will have to skip out on the green chilis in New Mexico and whatever they do --  KELLY: And that's the deal. That's the deal.STIREWALT: That's the deal.KELLY: Cruz is getting out of New Mexico and what's the other state? Oregon?STIREWALT: Oregon.KELLY: And Kasich is getting out of Indiana. And Indiana, how much does that help Cruz in Indiana because Indiana it's winner-take-all by state and Congressional district which I don't really understand that. But basically you want to win it and you don't want John Kasich to be in it.STIREWALT: Not only do you want to win it, but given the relatively few number of Congressional districts there, a good performance turns into winner-take-all, winner-take-all in pretty fast fashion. Most importantly though, Cruz needs to take as many delegates of the table as he can from Trump right now. Now, if their partnership, it's not really a partnership, it is a non-aggression pact between the two of them. It's still the snake and the mongoose. They just have agreed that they have a mutual enemy that is more threatening to both of them.KELLY: Uh-hm.STIREWALT: If it survives through there, they do this well and effectively use this by strategic campaigning in California, to deny Trump the necessary number of delegates, he is going to probably going to be short. They need to hold him maybe more than 100 back. Right now he is on track to be 65 or 70 back. They need to up that number so that he is far enough back so he can't go over the top with bound delegates. That is the delegates play. But the problem is, by teaming up, it looks too good for Trump and the current establishment media narrative which is, Donald Trump, Republican Party, look at these crooks, crooks, crooks, crooks, crooks.KELLY: Uh-hm. But they had no other chance. They had to do something.STIREWALT: Right.KELLY: But now, your reference to the snake and the mongoose is interesting. Because you I know are a parent as am I. And all I could think of when you said that was, you know, the book Little Bee. Little bee, Little bee, why do you flee? Because there is a scary snake chasing me. And so I want to go to the mongoose is chasing the snake and ultimately the lion is the one -- anyway, check it out. It's a great book.(LAUGHTER)Great to see you, Stirewalt.STIREWALT: Good to see you, too.Joining us now, Herman Cain, former presidential candidate and a Fox News contributor. And author of ""The Right Problems: What the President, Congress, and Every Candidate Should Be Working On."" And Ben Shapiro, the author of that article joins me now. He is editor-in-chief of DailyWire.com of an article critical of Trump for complaining about this plan. Good to see you both.So, Herman Cain, tell us why this is not a good idea for Cruz and Kasich.HERMAN CAIN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not a good idea because sometimes divide and conquer works. But, in politics, it may not and we really won't know until after the primaries tomorrow and the primaries a week from tomorrow. That's when we will know. But, here's what this alliance does recognize. It recognizes that John Kasich and Ted Cruz cannot get the nomination. But it does not recognize that it is still possible that Donald Trump could get it. I think they fear that more than they worry about trying to force a contested convention.KELLY: Ben, Trump says this is evidence of corruption, the corruption he's been telling his supporters about for months.BEN SHAPIRO, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY WIRE: Well, I really appreciate the babe in the woods routine from Donald Trump, the guy who said that he spent 30 years essentially bribing Democrats and then cut a deal basically that Ted Cruz and nonaggressive pact with his own with Ted Cruz for several months. And then he cut nonaggression pact with Ben Carson and then he cut one with Chris Christie and then he cut one with Mike Huckabee and then he cut one with Rick Santorum. So, for a guy who, you know, the art of the deal master and now complained and pretend suddenly he has found honesty.Suddenly he's found that the political process requires honor. The reality here is that Ted Cruz has been begging John Kasich to get out of the race for (audio gap). All this really does is it gets John Kasich out of the race in states where Cruz would do best and gets Cruz out of the race in a states where Kasich would do best. So, the idea that it's both of them taking down Trump, the truth is that, what it's really is, is Cruz is saying to Kasich, you won't get out, fine, let's acknowledge realities. As long as you are not going to get out and as long as I'm not going to win the nomination outright, we ought to split the states we do best in.KELLY: What about that, Herman Cain, the issue of Indiana because if Cruz is handily defeated by Trump in Indiana, he is in a whole lot of trouble. But if he can win that state it may actually change the course of this election.CAIN: It could be a game changer. It could be a game changer if Trump wins big in Indiana as well as Oregon and the other states where they have sort of split their resources. It could be a game changer and it will give Trump that momentum Chris referred to in the previous segment. So, I think that it's a calculated risk, obviously. But everything in politics is a calculated risk. So far, the opposition to Trump they have thrown everything, except the kitchen sink against Trump and it has not worked. It has simply empowered people who want to support Trump. I expect the headline on Wednesday to be kitchen sink is coming down the pike to Donald Trump. That's the only thing they haven't thrown at him yet.KELLY: Well, Tuesday night, tomorrow night he is expected, Trump, to do very well here in the northeast which they are calling the Acela Primary after the high speed train and services.SHAPIRO: Yes.KELLY: These states, the question is, what happens after then? And that's what Kasich and Cruz are looking to. But Ben, I know that you are saying your article, there are three reasons why this deal is perfectly legitimate in your view. The first one is that Trump does not have majority support. What do you mean? Why does this make this deal perfectly legitimate?SHAPIRO: We got 37 percent support. And again, unless the other side of aisle actually, quote-unquote, ""colludes"" and gets the other, and puts one anti-Trump candidate out there, we never get to see exactly how many people are against Trump. So, Trump can complain all he wants. He hasn't won a majority. There is no world where he has the majority and support in the popular vote. And while he complains about the process being rigged, he's got 37 percent of the popular vote and he is getting 50 percent of the delegates. So, it is not obviously rigged enough to stop him.And beyond that, you know, Donald Trump can complain all he wants about losing the pledge delegates. The reality is this, if he comes up short and then he doesn't get enough on pledged delegates, that is his own fault. Trump has his campaign manager out there, Paul Manafort trying to tell delegates that he can be a different guy, he can suddenly strip off his mask and he will be Ronald Reagan in the flesh. The reality is, delegates don't believe this and Donald Trump is having a tough time convincing them of it. It makes it more difficult when you spend most of your day ripping on how John Kasich eats pancakes while he dust your face of Cheetos before you do TV appearances.KELLY: Oh, come on! Stop that. There was a big pancake. That was a big bite.(LAUGHTER)You know, it's not that -- tinier bites are more lady like or gentlemanly. We can all agree on that. And, you know, even his critics should be able to allow for that.Herman, let me ask you about that point that Ben has made about, what Paul Manafort said to the delegates or to the party leaders down in Hollywood, Florida. Because that made a lot of news that he's telegraphing that Trump two people. That he has been playing a part. What say to that allegation?CAIN: He is not telegraphing that Trump is two people. This is just a sound bite that Ben and others want to pick up on. That's not the case. What Manafort is basically saying, is that one, Donald Trump has been running a wholesale campaign appealing to the masses ever since last June. But he is also saying that Donald Trump realizes he is going to have to do some more retail politics with the delegates as we go forward. So, that's not two people. That is a businessman realizing the reality of the situation that he has to appeal to some of those delegates. And I believe that he is going to be able to do that despite all of the noise that Ben is referring to along with a lot of the other people.KELLY: Ben, I know the other two points that you have raised in defense of this alliance is, number one Trump made alliance with Cruz himself which you've mentioned. And the third point is, you say Trump does not have the capacity to reign it in, to be sort of the more presidential version of himself that Manafort was suggesting to the party he can be. Why do you say that? Because Trump has -- he has been controlling himself over the past few weeks. Wouldn't you agree?SHAPIRO: If this is Donald Trump controlling himself, I cannot wait to see what he looks like uncontrolled. I mean, he -- it back from a spinal tap 11 to his spinal tap 10.5. Again, you just played a clip about five minutes ago of him talking about John Kasich eating pancakes and then yesterday at a rally, he did a full on impression of what he would look like if you were presidential. And he kind of staggered on the stage and did an impression of Hillary Clinton. Listen, it's funny stuff. But is this the kind of stuff that people expects from a commander-in-chief? Is this the kind of stuff that makes delegates comfortable, to make him a commander-in-chief. I highly doubt that especially given the way that delegates are splitting right now. Delegates are splitting disproportionately against Trump which is surprising given the fact that Trump has basically threatened riots at the convention if they don't give it to him.KELLY: But Herman, do you think it his sense of humor that has got him in trouble with some of these groups or the more incendiary comments he has made that, you know, we all have heard about at this point.CAIN: Here's the thing, Donald Trump has not gotten himself in trouble being Donald Trump. And to talk about his tone, well, last time I checked, he is leading in delegates. He is favored to win all those primaries tomorrow and he might just pull it off and get 1237 delegates. This game is a long way from over. So, all of this political noise about what Trump said, what he did, I think people appreciate two things. Many things in Donald Trump. Number one, they appreciate his honesty and integrity and they appreciate his sense of rumor. But every time he says something that might be considered funny, well, some people who is anti-Trump, they try to turn it into a frenzy and it simply is not working.KELLY: There had been some controversial. But I got to ask you before I let you go quickly, Herman. Seriously when Kasich ate that pizza with a fork and a knife, as a pizza man yourself, that had to be a problem for you. That's when you went chief Trump, wasn't it? That was the thing that did it.CAIN: No. No comment.(LAUGHTER)Look, I don't care whether you -- I don't care whether you eat pizza with a fork or whether you eat it New York style and you told it and you take a bite. It does not matter if it's good pizza.KELLY: Amen. Good to see you guys. Both of you. Thank you.CAIN: Thank you.KELLY: So big news today as Donald Trump has agreed to sit down with yours truly for an interview in my upcoming FOX broadcast network special. This is big news. This following our heart-to-heart earlier this month at Trump Tower which he agreed to it at my request. The GOP presidential frontrunner will be a guest on ""Megyn Kelly Presents"" or it might be ""Megyn Kelly Presents."" We will see. A prime time event that airs on May 17th, that's a Tuesday night on FOX TV, the ""American Idol"" FOX. The Empire FOX. Not the Fox News Channel. Big Fox at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time.Extended portions of that interview that you will not see over on big FOX will then appear over here, right here on ""The Kelly File"" the very next night on the FOX News Channel. I look forward to what promises to be a compelling and wide ranging sit-down.Well, Hillary Clinton says she has a battle plan ready in case Donald Trump tries to soften his image in the general election matchup. But there is new polling tonight that could send and shivers down the spine of Democrats as well as some Republicans. Ben Domenech and Tucker Carlson on what the polls shows on whether which one to believe.Plus, in a touching display of patriotism, a group of middle school students begins singing the national anthem during a visit to the 9/11 memorial. So, why were they ordered to stop in the middle of the song? ""The Kelly File"" gets answers.And there is some 200,000 ex-felons, including murderers and rapists getting their voting rights concerned. There are growing concerns that this has nothing to do with equal rights and everything to do with helping Hillary Clinton. Judge Andrew Napolitano explains why he says there is no way you can ignore the politics at play.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. TERRY MCAULIFFE, D-VA.: I think some of the languages come out of the Republicans, I would tell them to be very careful on how they frame this. Very careful their rhetoric.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, two national polls delivering mixed signals for Hillary Clinton as she prepares for a potential general election matchup against Donald Trump. In one poll Secretary Clinton holds a sizeable 11 point lead over Trump. But another suggests a much tighter race with Clinton ahead by just three points over the GOP frontrunner. This as Mrs. Clinton's camp releases a new political ad targeted not at her democratic rival Bernie Sanders but at Donald Trump. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I will be changing very rapidly. I'm very capable of changing to anything I want to change to.At the right time I will be so presidential, you will be so bored.They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapist.I will use the word anchor baby. This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of my personal heroines Maya Angelou is that, when someone shows you who they are, believe them.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Well, for his part, Mr. Trump doesn't seem so concerned about his standing versus Secretary Clinton or that of his GOP rival John Kasich for that matter who right now beats Hillary in most head-to-polling, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: He keeps talking about how he does with Hillary Clinton. He hasn't had one negative ad yet. When they put in the first negative ad about him. He is going to collapse like a rock. Wait until you see this. Boom. Boom. You will see. You will see. I will beat Hillary Clinton, crooked Hillary. I will beat her so badly.(CROWD CHEERING)So badly. So badly.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Ben Domenech is publisher of The Federalist. Tucker Carlson is editor-in-chief of ""The Daily Caller"" and co-host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" right here on FNC. Good to see you both.Ben, effective ads?BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, THE FEDERALIST: I think it's an okay ad. I think that she is obviously shifting to this general election conversation and anticipating that Trump is going to soften his message as he gets closer to the Republican nomination. You know, for my part, I don't think we actually see that yet. It was interesting listening to you talk to some of your prior guests about this. From my perspective Megyn, being presidential actually is not so much about the tone but it is about the message. In the sense that at this point in virtually every presidential campaign in the past you see a nominee as they get closer and closer to the mark that they need to hit. Recognize that they need to win over the supporters of some of their closest competitors.They do so by extending olive branches, by inviting people, who supported people like Ted Cruz or John Kasich. Into the fold by saying, hey, I'm looking to represent the whole party here, not just the people who backed me. That is not what we're hearing from Trump thus far. And I'm kind of surprise. I would have thought that he would have shifted to that already.KELLY: Uh-hm. Tucker, what did you think of the ad?TUCKER CARLSON, THE DAILY CALLER: I emphatically agree with Ben that it's about the message tone. And still a contested primary. Maybe that's why it is so bitter. I thought the ad was ineffective. There are ways to attack Trump. You could say he is reckless, he is a no one off. Those are fair criticism. This doesn't make them. It doesn't make any argument actually. It basically says he says outrageous things. Well, that's demonstrably true like you were voting for them because of that. And he says he changed his opinions.Well, he brags about that. So, it's hard to expose a man who exposes himself as often as Trump does. And it also assumes that you are appalled by his positions. Now, people's attitudes have changed a lot and have changed an awful lot in this year. Is it really so crazy to say surveil extremist mosques. We have been doing that since 9/11. Is it insane to claim illegal aliens bring some crime? Well, actually they do. So, she could win if she made an argument. But saying this game is prima facie a racist isn't really a rebuttal against what Trump is saying. It only wins people who are already on your side.KELLY: Already with her.DOMENECH: -- Effective.CARLSON: Right. Ben, let's talk about these polls, because there is one that shows her 11 points ahead of Trump in a head-to-head matchup. That's a Suffolk University poll. And then another one George Washington University battleground poll that shows her only three points over him, which is about as tight as we have seen it. What do you make of it?  DOMENECH: You know, the battleground poll is a bit of an outlier. Most of the polls that we have seen have shown, you know, Trump in the high singles, to even the double digits in terms of lagging behind Hillary. It is a poll that should encourage the Trump camp. At the same time, it does have a couple of aspects to it that seem a little off kilter in the sense that they show a significant Republican advantage when it comes to economic ratings. That's not something that we see across other polls. And so it's really difficult to see -- say whether this is going to be the kind of beginning of a trend that continues.One thing that we have to recognize about this is that we are in new territory. We are with two potential candidates who are in the most unpopular ratings amongst all sorts of different segments of the electorate than we have ever seen in the modern era. And because of that, it's very unpredictable. To Tucker's point, you know, the idea that Trump can be criticized because he has changed his positions a lot. Hillary Clinton is the queen of that and has been through her entire career. It's not like she is can make the argument that you can look at her where she stands and trust what she is going to say any more than you could Donald Trump.KELLY: Tucker, what do you think -- I mean, at this point, Trump obviously see what Kasich and Cruz are now doing to try to stop him from getting the nomination.CARLSON: Right.KELLY: He needs to consolidate his support. You know, he needs to get more than the core Trump supporters to come over to team Trump.CARLSON: Yes.KELLY: But the question is how? How does he do it?CARLSON: I think it's tough. I mean, I think some of these gaps are unbridgeable. Once you call someone a Nazi it's kind of hard to go back and say, yes, but you know, you are Nazi. I mean, it is sort of a Rubicon --KELLY: Sure.CARLSON: -- that a lot of his critics have crossed. That's right. And I don't think they can come back. They have declared him immoral. And so, it would be a stain on their own moral record were they to support him. So, I think the Republican Party is broken and it may split down the line. But really his argument, the only good argument for Trump, the real argument is he is probably not likely to beat Hillary but he is the only Republican running who even has a shot. Because America has changed a lot. Everybody knows this because of immigration. The demographics are just strongly in favor of the Democrats.KELLY: Uh-hm.CARLSON: And yet --KELLY: That's what Kasich is saying. Kasich is saying, that's why you should choose me even though he has lost what they would be calling one in 38.CARLSON: Look, this is not endorsement of Trump obviously but that is just a silly argument. I mean, you have had all of these elections and Kasich has won only his home state.KELLY: Uh-hm.CARLSON: I mean, so, in some theoretical head-to-head, six months out, sure, he does fine. But that's not reality. I mean, the truth is, Trump in a dynamic, insane year like this one, perhaps the Trump campaign could just scramble the map and pull off something really unexpected. It's impossible to see any other Republican doing that. Now, I'm saying that really as objectively as I can.KELLY: Great to see you both. I have got to run.DOMENECH: Thank you.CARLSON: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: There is growing concerns tonight that Hillary Clinton could find herself in the White House with the help of some ex-felons as a governor with very close ties to the Clintons restores voting rights to some 200,000 ex-cons, murderers, rapists and others just before the election. Judge Napolitano is here next. He says there is no way you can ignore the politics at play here.And then, a star college athlete, 3.67 grade point average kicked out of school for consensual sex. He didn't complain about it. The woman he was having sex with didn't complain. But a friend of that woman complained. We'll ask our legal panel what the chances are that this young man will be successful in suing his school and the Obama administration, which helped put him in this situation.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, new concerns that one governor's push to restore voting rights may actually be a ploy to get Hillary Clinton into the White House.Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe who was Mrs. Clinton's 2008 campaign chairman just restored voting rights to more than 200,000 ex-felons in his state. Why did he do that? Trace Gallagher is live in our West Coast news room, Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey Megyn, you should know these armed robbers, rapists and murderers would be allowed to do vote even if they didn't pay their court fines or restitution to their victims.Governor McAuliffe says he's rectifying Virginia's long sad history of suppressing African-American voting power. One in four black residents of the state has been banned from voting because of restrictions on felons.By using the power, the governor circumvented Virginia's republican run legislature and is now being accused of providing a blatant favor to his old friend Hillary Clinton, trying to give her a crucial edge in a swing state.So far, this election season black voters, especially in the south, have turned out in very large numbers for Hillary Clinton. Here's McAuliffe on ABC this week, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCAULIFFE: Tell the republicans quit complaining go out and earn these folks right to vote for you. Go out and talk to them.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Even republicans who support giving some felons back their right to vote say McAuliffe went too far by including violent offenders. Back in 2010, then democratic Virginia Governor Tim Kaine also wanted to restore voting rights to felons but thought that legally it had to be handled on a case-by-case basis.Writing, quoting here, ""A blanket order restoring voting rights of everyone would be a rewrite of the law rather than a contemplated use of the executive clemency powers."" But governor McAuliffe believes he not only has the legal authority for this move, he plans to sign similar executive orders each month to cover felons as they are released, Megyn?KELLY: Trace, thank you. Joining me now with more of Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst and The New York Times bestselling author Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, good to see you.ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY: So he -- just to put this in context, in 2012, President Obama beat Mitt Romney in Virginia by 150,000 votes.NAPOLITANO: Right.KELLY: McAuliffe is adding 200,000 ex-felons to the voting rolls. That will help -- that will help lengthen that potential lead by quite an amount.NAPOLITANO: It probably will. So, there are two arguments at play here. One is the argument from justice and from the constitution and one is the political argument.The argument from justice, I happen to be one of those people who believe you should not be perpetually punished. That when you do your time and pay your fine and make restitution, whatever the court has ordered, you should get back into society and you should be able to vote.KELLY: You could have your full citizen rights restored.NAPOLITANO: Correct. That the eighth amendment to the constitution prohibits perpetual punishment and denying people the right to vote after they've done their time is a form of perpetual punishment. But you have two attorneys general, one republican and one democrat in Virginia in the past eight years, who each said it can't be done on a blanket basis.The law gave the governor the ability to relieve convicted felons of some of their punishment as long as the governor examined each felon individually rather than did it in a group of 200,000 people. One of the problems is these 200,000 people lost their registration to vote at the moment they were convicted of the felony.So they have to go back and reregister and they had plenty of time in which to do that. But given his relationship to Mrs. Clinton., given his financial relationship to the Clintons, remember we're dirt poorer and we need money to buy a house and Terry McAuliffe bought the house for them, given the fact that.KELLY: So his debt is paid, really. I mean, he doesn't need to do anything funky with the voting polls.NAPOLITANO: But given the fact that Virginia is a very very key, pivotal state.KELLY: That it's -- it's more swing than it's ever been.NAPOLITANO: Correct. It's kind of obvious what he's trying to do, so there's going to be a challenge.KELLY: Because the presumption is they say that the vast majority of these ex-cons are African-American and there is an assumption that they are going to vote democrat. But McAuliffe is saying you are walking on dangerous ground when you say that. Why don't you go out and fight for those votes, republican candidate where.NAPOLITANO: Well, is he actually making a good point, but I will tell you this. This is not going to be decided at the voting booth and not going to be decided by Terry McAuliffe. It's going to be decided by the Supreme Court of Virginia as to whether or not he can actually do this in such massive numbers.KELLY: Can they revoke it?NAPOLITANO: They could very well follow the attorneys general who said to him you have got to do it individually.KELLY: I was surprise to do see that in some 38 states, voting rights are automatically restored once prison, parole, probation time has been complete, 38 states say.NAPOLITANO: Yes, that is the modern rule and Virginia has kept the old rule, but it is given.KELLY: And a lot of people think you murder somebody, you are done. You don't get to vote anymore. I don't care if you did your time. There are certain things you don't get to do any longer.NAPOLITANO: You know, when people have paid their debt to society, they have the right to be fully rehabilitated and to come back in society and start their life anew and that includes voting.The question is, is this the way to do it? Is this the time to do it? Or should it be done by the Virginia legislature if they want to do it in a group of 210,000 at once?KELLY: Fascinating. Judge, great to see you.NAPOLITANO: Good to see you.KELLY: Well, do you remember this video showing a doctor -- female doctor attacking a male Uber driver? This story made headlines as few months ago and now the hospital where she works just made the decision on whether this woman should lose her job.Yes, the judge wants to weigh in. This is not your segment. So should what you do in your private life, matter in your professional life? A lot of people at home say, ""No, no, don't look at."" We've got a decision in the case as ""Marthur"" are back together next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: A Kelly file follow-up for you tonight. On Friday, we spoke with a college student who says he was suspended from Colorado State University Pueblo for having consensual sex with his friend. Grant Neal says he and his girlfriend were -- or this woman that he knew, were having unprotected sex but she stopped him and asked him to wear protection, which he did immediately.The next day, his girlfriend told her friend about the incident and that friend thought that this was a rape. Even though neither one of the participants thought it was a rape. So the friend reported it to university authorities. Then even though the girlfriend testified the college administrators she was not raped, they did not care. Listen to the part of our interview with Grant and his attorney.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Andrew, we have been covering this repeatedly. And what has happened in these cases from college campus to college campus is the administration has set up young college men to have the book thrown at them and basically to be convicted without a lawyer and under a standard that no court would accept. Isn't that true, Andrew?ANDREW MILTENBERG, GRANT NEAL'S ATTORNEY: That's absolutely true. And, in fact, what is unfortunately happening is the Obama administration has laid a very heavy hand on the disciplinary process in colleges such that it's virtually assured that an allegation will turn in to a finding of responsibility and expulsion.GRANT NEAL, VICTIM: I have been having to deal with this for so long and it's just really hard thing to do when all the rights that you're given as a natural born citizen of the United States, as constitutional due process, I didn't even have that. So, that was extremely difficult to handle.KELLY: What are your odds of reversing this policy or getting the Department of Education to listen?MILTENBERG: I think it takes a situation as dramatic as Grant's to have the people of this country and the Department of Education sit up and say, ""Yes, we want to be proactive about sexual assault, but we can't do it at the cost of due process.""(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Arthur Aidala. He's a New York trial attorney and Fox News legal analyst and Mark Eiglarsh. He's a criminal defense attorney, former prosecutor. Great to see you both. So Arthur, let me start with you. Did the school get it wrong?ARTHUR AIDALA, NEW YORK TRIAL ATTORNEY: The school probably got it wrong on the facts themselves, but not in the society that we're living in now, Megyn. Like, what you said and what the lawyers said, we've created the Obama administration governors, the legal system, the lawyers have created an environment that once a school is put on notice.And that's what happened when the girlfriend, not the person who engaged in sexual relations her friend, puts the school, ""Hey, a sexual encounter took place. She didn't want something to happen at first but then he fixed it"", they are on notice and if they don't do anything, they are absolutely liable for something. But on this fact, of course it sounds ridiculous, but we're the ones who created that.KELLY: Mark, it doesn't sound ridiculous. It is ridiculous. It's ridiculous. Neither party that think there was a rape.MARK EIGLARSH, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Of course it's ridiculous. Megyn, I looked up in the dictionary under miscarriage of justice and do you know what I found? Not that because they list words individually. But if they clumped them together, they would have miscarriage of justice in this case because it is.It's fundamentally unfair. No due process and now is he labeled a sexual offender and can't get in any college? It's outrageous.AIDALA: Listen -- god bless you for talking about this now. I have been handling cases like this for decades. That's just the environment that needs an education.KELLY: No, no. That's not true. The Obama administration changed the standards to just preponderance of the evidence to basically get yourself booted off campus. You just have to prove by 51 percent that you were raped or in this case, that somebody you know on campus was raped and accused has very few rights. He is not allowed to do confront his accuser. He can't have a lawyer in a lot of these proceedings, Arthur.AIDALA: Correct, you're right but that's what's been going on in educational facilities for quite some time now. This is not a brand new thing. I've represented people. You're right, I'm not allowed to be there. I am allowed to do write a letter but not allowed to do be there with my client for -- as a criminal defense attorney, let me just.KELLY: Do you think can a guy labeled a sex offender and take away his college degree, he wants to be a doctor, 3.67 GPA, promising athlete, done. You're done and good luck getting into another college when you have that on your record.I have to move on because we have two other cases to get to. We're going to continue to follow this case. Mark, our old friend and neurology resident, very smart young woman made a very stupid decision. Here she is, let's watch it, attacking the Uber driver. She was angry. She is throwing things and well, she is angry, yes, you can see that and tell us what the deal is now. So her hospital had to make a decision about whether she was going to continue on as a resident there and?EIGLARSH: Yes, it was very easy decision as far as I'm concerned. She is gone. And do you know what? She should count her lucky stars that she wasn't stripped of her liberty because she committed probably about four or five different offenses that I counted.KELLY: But he didn't press charges. The Uber driver did not press charges.EIGLARSH: Merely because he didn't press charges didn't mean that she didn't commit criminal offenses and it relieves me, my wife, and my kids of going to Jackson Memorial Hospital here in Miami. I'm not done, and looking at her and saying, ""That's our doctor?"" I will pass on her. Let the showcase on price is right.AIDALA: If you and your wife or one of your children need her care, at a time when she is sober, you don't really care about her bedside manner or what she does when she's out of the Uber car. It's about her ability to perform her duties as a doctor.EIGLARSH: You are right, and it has been called into question by what I see on that video. I will pass. I will wait for the next doctor.KELLY: I mean, if we're going to start eliminating all doctors prone to fits of rage, we'll going to get rid a lot of doctors.AIDALA: Yes. I mean, Mark, the way you and I behave that Megyn.(CROSS TALK)EIGLARSH: What you saw in that video, Arthur, this was rage?KELLY: She said -- she had cocktails that was clear, but she also said that her father had recently been hospitalized, so you got to give her, you know, a little sympathy for that and she said I know something else bad happened.AIDALA: Mark, quite simply if people saw the way you and I behaved at Megyn's Christmas party, they say we shouldn't be in the courtroom, but yet still go in the courtroom and we do a great job every day so.MARK: Be yourself. I saw you at that party. That's all you, my friend, come on?KELLY: All right, I want to get to this. She has gotten booted from her university, but she has an appeal because it is a real question about what you do in your off time should really, you know, cost to you or lose your job.She didn't do this at the hospital to a patient. Okay, a guy walks into a Wholefoods, Mark, walks into a Wholefoods, leaves a pastor and claims that they put an anti-gay slur on his cake, that Wholefoods said we're very sorry, this is -- oh, wait, and they say now he is lying and say they have proof, so tell us?EIGLARSH: Right. It looks like he is lying. I can't say with certainty, but then when he gets home, he then sees it says -- well, it says a gay slur on there and he claims that the sticker, showing the UPC code was at the bottom of the cake.The video that Wholefoods released shows it was the top of the cake that he then is probably lying about this experience. Think of what somebody is like to do that. Just think about it for a second. Yes, I mean, if Wholefoods should own that guy.AIDALA: So just seeing you know, the legal part of it is he filed a suit against Wholefoods for picking up his cake that says Love all or Loved everyone and then he.KELLY: So he wanted it to say Love Wins and he claimed they put on Love Wins and then the F word which is a derogatory word for gay men. And Wholefoods, they looked at the surveillance tape and they finally said, ""That's absolutely false"", completely and now the question is whether whole foods should sue him, Arthur?AIDALA: OK, but here going back to the first topic we did. OK, he is suing Wholefoods because they had a gay slur on there, for what? What's his mental damage? Why is this a lawsuit? Why are we bringing this to the court?EIGLARSH: Because of the damages? Hold on, Arthur. Those are the damages that presuppose anything.AIDALA: No, my point is why the legal system always involved in these things? Why is it always a lawsuit?KELLY: Because if it was true that he made the whole thing up, he was looking for attention.AIDALA: So that's the counter suit. So that's -- that's the only reason why we are in court. He sued Wholefoods because he picks up a cake and has this slur on it and then a couple days later after this internal investigation, they are saying you are lying and they are counter suing him and there are whole justices.KELLY: I don't know what you're saying, you lost me but I do have something important for you which is, I hope your cake this weekend. Happy times, Arthur and Mary Anne. The big weekend, Arthur is taking the plunge.AIDALA: Yes. Let me use this.EIGLARSH: Congrats, brother.KELLY: You don't need that, stop that.AIDALA: The greatest gift on the whole world, right, Meg?KELLY: You're absolutely right. You got nothing to worry about. It's a match made in heaven and I'm wishing you all the best, all my love to both of you.AIDALA: Thank you. Two beautiful people in every sense of that word. Great to see you guys. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: A patriotic moment cut short at the 9/11 memorial in downtown Manhattan. A children's choir from Waynesville, North Carolina, was told to stop singing the national anthem by security guards. Trace Gallagher has the story. Trace?GALLAGHER: Megyn, the choir were in New York on a music-filled itinerary singing at the Cathedral of the Saint John the Divine, singing the Lion King on Broadway and when they got to ground zero, they were so touched they wanted to honor the site the best way they knew how with a song.So they asked one security guard if they could sing and the guard said yes as long as they moved to the side. But in the middle of what their teacher calls a reverent rendition of the national anthem, another guard came over and cut them off because the rules say, you have to have a 35 dollar permit to sing. One of the mom was so furious, she posted the video online, got hundreds of thousands of views. Watch the video followed by some of the kids on Fox and Friends.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: A spokesman for the memorial admitted the situation was -- yes, the situation was mishandled and invited the kids to come back. Megyn?KELLY: Good. Trace, thanks. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Tune in tomorrow night at 6:00 P.M. eastern as Bret Baier and yours truly bring you live election results from the battle for the east. In the meantime what do you think of the Cruz-Kasich alliance?Facebook.com/thekellyfile and on Twitter@megynkelly, thanks for watching. I'm Megyn Kelly.

1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/09/12/clinton-camp-expresses-regret-over-handling-health-scare/	Clinton camp expresses regret over handling of health scare	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" September 12, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and Hillary Clinton. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Hillary Clinton camp has accused Donald Trump of pushing, quote, ""Deranged conspiracy theories"" about of his opponent's health. They may be forced to change that narrative. However, after the secretary scary stumble yesterday. Clinton is recovering at home today after appearing to collapse while abruptly departing New York's 9/11 memorial ceremony. Her team initially said the democratic nominee overheated, but they finally came clean that a doctor had given her an ammonia diagnosis just two days before. Even Clinton ally David Axelrod thinks it was a mistake to keep that secret tweeting, ""Antibiotics can take care of pneumonia."" What's the cure for unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems? Her camp is expressing some regret today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRIAN FALLON, CLINTON CAMPAIGN PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I think that in retrospect we could have handled it better in terms of providing more information more quickly. I should say that is soon as she got into the vehicle, she was alert the whole time and was telling staff that she was fine. I do think that in those 90 minutes that elapsed, we could have gotten more information out more quickly and that's on the staff, that's on us. And we regret that.ANDREA MITCHELL, MSNBC HOST: Did she ever actually lose consciousness?FALLON: No, Andrea. I don't think so.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right, debatable. So we'll decide because we have a table of doctors here. Don't we?(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Just kidding. All right, so Dana, what did you think from a communications perspective? You've got Axelrod, kind of going on the offensive saying what people who are not necessarily supporting Hillary were thinking the same thing, why are you making more trouble for yourself?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: The interesting thing about David Axelrod coming out and saying that is that when he was working with Barack Obama and they were challenging Hillary Clinton in the primary in 2008, they know -- they knew their opponent very well. So David Axelrod knows that her team has this desire. And I think it comes from the top, to just try to keep everything very quiet. I had walking pneumonia two years ago on the show. If you remember, I coughed for six weeks and finally Greg said, ""Dana, I don't think that's just a cough. I think pneumonia. Sure enough I did.GUILFOYLE: It seemed like Ebola at the time, it was --PERINO: And it was horrible.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: And I remember -- but, I actually felt OK, so I--GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I saved your life.PERINO: The thing is when he says that antibiotics can take care of pneumonia, not if it's viral pneumonia. I mean, you could split this in all sort of different ways and go on WMD -- WebMD and try to figure it out. But I do think that it wouldn't have been that big a deal for her team to come out on a Friday night. It was Friday night that they got the diagnosis and say, ""She has been diagnosed with walking pneumonia"" which after -- or pneumonia, whatever it is. But that would have explained a lot of things.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: But now she seems -- they just made it so much worse for themselves. They're really good at that.GUTFELD: It could -- actually, if they had done it Friday, they could have used that to explain the basket .PERINO: Of deplorable.GUTFELD: . of deplorable. It's all that's because she had pneumonia, right?GUILFOYLE: No, I've --GUTFELD: They could have married it together. Look, she's good at hiding an illness, but tells ISIS there are no ground troops. So she knows how to keep a secret if the secret is hers. And -- you know I look at this, is I brought this here. I have -- I know I'm not the first person to notice this, but it's like this way to the hospital.GUILFOYLE: Oh my, God.GUTFELD: I know other people have seen this. And it's like, it's like a weird symbol that I think, maybe they should change it. Maybe it should -- no, no, no.PERINO: No, no, no.GUTFELD: It should be up like -- Hillary rise, Hillary on the rise. That's, that's much better. But it's just -- it's strange. This is -- and the other thing, would you mind if I --GUILFOYLE: Strange like this show.GUTFELD: Yeah. The other point I want to make --GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: What made this story? The e-mail story moves slowly. But this happened because of a video. This is, this is the way news works. Now you read -- when there was a video, literally, a viral video.GUILFOYLE: Who pushed the video?GUTFELD: Pneumonia.GUTFELD: They now --PERINO: And they can't fix that either.GUTFELD: Yeah, exactly.GUILFOYLE: All right, so that was good, a nice opening there from Marcus Welby, M.D. in there.GUTFELD: I am not a doctor.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: Although I pretended to be one in small towns.GUILFOYLE: And you also claimed to have saved Dana's life. This is also interesting. OK, let's hear now from Dr. McDreamy --ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: So --GUILFOYLE: Mr. Doctor McDreamy here.BOLLING: Let's not, let's have diagnosed Clinton. Let's diagnose her campaign. And we'll look -- 2005, she faints before a speech, '09 she falls and braced her elbow, 2011, falls boarding the airplane, 2012 falls, gets a concussion, can't testify and Benghazi has to be delayed. She, in 2013, she needs the special lenses on her glasses to testify because of dizziness. February of this year falls, walking up the stairs. Recently the coughing fits the campaign. She jokes about --PERINO: Can I add one other thing?BOLLING: Yeah.PERINO: When she did her interview with the FBI, and we got that information, she actually said that she couldn't remember several types.BOLLING: I remember.PERINO: So you can add one more --BOLLING: I'm getting to that. We're not even there yet.PERINO: Oh.BOLLING: The cough recently. The coughing fits and she jokes about it being allergic reaction to Donald Trump, and the campaign jokes and says -- that doesn't even joke anymore, the campaign covers. They say you know what, she has had of seasonal allergies even, maybe even recommended or suggesting she was taking antihistamine., Then Sunday -- Dana, and then Dana is right, inserting there 40 times she can't remember, can't remember. And then Sunday, she blacks out. If you look at that video, and I've seen it probably a hundred times, that right foot is dragged along into the van, anyway you sliced it. And there's no way that she --GUTFELD: Why would you slice it?BOLLING: There's no way she is conscious being brought into that van. And remember, her legs are staggering. Here is the problem.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Ninety minutes, it took the campaign to say it was overheating and then nine hours later, nine hours later they realize that the video is out there. They got caught and they said, you know what, five days ago, four days ago, we knew about her being diagnosed with pneumonia. Now, come on guys, they've always reverts to the lies. That's the natural reaction of the Clintons and the Clinton campaign. I will tell you, she can't laugh it off anymore. I certainly hope the secretary is OK, but her campaign is in free fall right now. She is done. She is not fit to run the country.GUILFOYLE: What's going to happen to the polls, Bolling?BOLLING: Right.GUILFOYLE: But this is -- it didn't cover that.BOLLING: It does matter do is --GUILFOYLE: It didn't cover this.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: There you go. So we've heard from Dr. Meredith Gray, Greg and I. So that means you got to be McSteamy, because Bolling is McDreamy. What do you have to say about this?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: No, I --GUILFOYLE: Because you're sick, you got your colds from Hillary.WILLIAMS: I may, I may have, but you know, but I -- I was just --what is the truth? I wanted -- so I thought you were building towards the truth.BOLLING: She had -- listen, she needs to tell us. You know, let's find out.WILLIAMS: Oh, because you know --BOLLING: Let's get all the medical records.WILLIAMS: Let me answer. You don't know the truth .BOLLING: Let's get all the --WILLIAMS: . but you build the --BOLLING: Well, here is the, here's the truth.WILLIAMS: Bolling case.BOLLING: Her campaign is in free fall.WILLIAMS: Oh, get out of town. Let me just say this.BOLLING: OK.WILLIAMS: I think that --BOLLING: All right.WILLIAMS: What's the real issue here is the lack of transparency by the campaign. I mean on Friday, she did a lot of stuff. You saw it here right here on ""The Five,"" we had her meeting with the national security advisors. Then she has a press conference. Then she went on and did an -- I think an interview with CNN. So she was doing a lot of stuff even as she apparently had this -- we know about people working through a cold. I can tell you, I was doing that on Friday. But the real --GUILFOYLE: You said it was allergy.WILLIAMS: I don't know what it was.GUILFOYLE: Now it's a cold.WILLIAMS: But I know I went home, I was taking Claritin and all the kind. I was asking Greg, I was asking Dr. Greg for advice. But the reality is that she and her staff, I think reacting to people like Rudy Giuliani saying, ""Oh, she has a concussion or she, or she's got low stamina. She can't do it."" All the stuff that you just heard from Eric, I think they were overly protective to the point of being stupid.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: And then, not telling anybody that the woman is sick. And you know everybody gets sick.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: We're humans. Now, it comes into, oh, it's a serious issue because the people who are the birthers --GUTFELD: You know what --WILLIAMS: And then the (inaudible) -- all those, all those people with all their craziness. Now they get, hey, look at that video, Hillary Clinton. I don't know she was out, but she looked like she was disabled.GUTFELD: OK, but Juan, this is what I don't understand. You are running for president. You must have the best physician outside of Barack Obama. You must have the best person there who can tell you exactly what to do. It blows my mind how sloppy they treated this.PERINO: Well, you don't know that maybe -- the doctor maybe said why you don't take a few days off.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And she said, ""I can't. It's the 9/11 memorial."" How's that gonna look like?GUTFELD: Right, exactly.GUILFOYLE: No, but apparently she got --GUTFELD: She don't want to be proven --GUILFOYLE: Fifteen of those .GUTFELD: She didn't want her --PERINO: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . doctors, but --GUTFELD: Her skeptics, the skeptics to be proven correct. And by doing so, she proved them correct.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: By going and fulfilling -- she actually showed them that she's not well. It's, it's also interesting to watch the media. Bend over backwards for this; originally, MSNBC, it was all about the humidity. How hot it was? Oh my God, you know, how could she wear that jacket in that heat? And then all of a sudden it was like, how brave it was that she had pneumonia and she was out there. It was -- they just could not bear the truth.GUILFOYLE: It was like the most breezed that we had here in New York in a long time.GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah.GUILFOYLE: It was actually quite .BOLLING: Here's the problem with --GUILFOYLE: . refreshing.BOLLING: With this whole theory .GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: . is that the campaign can none of them just say, no, secretary, we need to come clean on this?PERINO: Right.GUILFOYLE: Uh-huh.BOLLING: So then she -- look, they knew Friday at the very latest. She was diagnosed earlier in the week, but she -- they knew at the very latest Friday that she had pneumonia allegedly .PERINO: Right.BOLLING: . from a few days prior. By the way, I would like to see -- I would love to see if we can get an x-ray. We can see pneumonia on that.WILLIAMS: Now you want x-ray.BOLLING: But it was great to see. Anyway, hold on. So they know Friday. She --WILLIAMS: I think we got Doctor McStuffins here.BOLLING: She has this episode that try and to hide. They hold the reporters back. She has this episode going into the van. At that point they should have said, ""All right, we need to come clean. She had pneumonia. She still has pneumonia,"" instead they wait. First, they say it was overheated, and then they say nine hours later -- well, I guess what guys, it was -- we, we actually knew about it on Friday.GUILFOYLE: Right. I mean --BOLLING: She had pneumonia. They're always willing to lie --GUTFELD: What if it's not pneumonia?WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUTFELD: I mean, look.WILLIAMS: That would be a lie, but I'm just telling you --GUTFELD: You can't -- you don't -- who do you trust?BOLLING: You can see what's next, right?WILLIAMS: But let me just --BOLLING: That's all I'm saying.WILLIAMS: Let me just say something positive here.PERINO: Cable news.WILLIAMS: I think that Dana was picking up on a moment ago. There are a lot of politicians -- I don't understand how they do it.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: I mean these guys, and women, go on and on. They work crazy hours, and I get tired covering them. I mean if you are on a -- if you are in the press pool, you are in trouble. By the way, there was no press pool with her if you know.GUILFOYLE: I know, Juan.WILLIAMS: And that's the problem.GUILFOYLE: You probably got sick too, from making so many excuses from this.WILLIAMS: No, no, no.GUILFOYLE: That is exhausting, all right.WILLIAMS: Thank you. But I'm just saying, seriously .GUILFOYLE: OK.WILLIAMS: I don't understand how they do it sometimes. And you -- and they have think that it's a badge of courage if you are like, oh, he, he just got a cold, work through it.PERINO: Well --WILLIAMS: Or your stomach is upset -- work through it. Eat the chicken dinner. That's all he got.GUILFOYLE: Perhaps they should be a little bit worried about her health. But are democrats really worried about her health? I don't know. Maybe. It appears although according to two journalists, here is Cokie Roberts.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COKIE ROBERTS, NPR ""MORNING EDITION"": The fact that it comes now when the polls are tightening and democrats were already saying that Hillary was the only candidate who could not beat Trump, and it's taking her off of the campaign trail, cancelling her trip to California today.DAVID SHUSTER, FORMER MSNBC AND AL JAZEERA ANCHOR: Yeah, today. Yeah.ROBERTS: All right. It has them very nervously beginning to whisper and about trying to having her step aside and finding another candidate. I think it's unlikely to be a real thing. And I'm sure it's an overreaction of an already skittish party.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Hmm, interesting. A lot in there, and David Shuster tweeted this Intel from democratic operatives, ""Expect emergency DNC meeting to consider a replacement."" OK, so -- yes, Greg, go ahead.GUTFELD: No. I was just gonna say --GUILFOYLE: Hillary -- you are Hillary's --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I would not be surprised. I mean, you know, I mean it could just be pneumonia, but pneumonia -- I mean, there are a lot of things going on that we don't know about. I think you have to consider Joe Biden.BOLLING: Just pneumonia?GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: You said it, yes.BOLLING: 57,000 people .GUTFELD: I know.BOLLING: . in America --GUTFELD: If you are 69 with it.BOLLING: CDC numbers, not mine. 57,000 people die .GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: . from pneumonia and influenza in a minute -- that's why it matters. It's not just, oh, just pneumonia.GUTFELD: Well --BOLLING: It could kill her.GUTFELD: Yeah, but a lot of people get over pneumonia.WILLIAMS: Yeah, a lot of people who are sick and whose immune systems are weak, then get pneumonia and said they die pneumonia. But I mean, you know I mean, ordinary people get sick, Eric.BOLLING: Then I'm just suggesting that not many ordinary people have this many instances of falling year after year, after year, after year --WILLIAMS: Oh, Eric.BOLLING: No, I'm just quite --WILLIAMS: Yeah, here -- why don't you say --BOLLING: But can I, can I ask yourself --WILLIAMS: She has a --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: She has a hyperthoid (ph) -- hyperthyroid problem, right?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Right. She has an allergy problem.GUILFOYLE: It's hypo. She's hypothyroid --WILLIAMS: But this is not like, oh this is not like, you know what? The way I get your -- it's almost like you start to think we should have all worn black in here .BOLLING: Here's --WILLIAMS: . because we're going to her funeral.BOLLING: Here is what I think he was -- what ends up happening.GUILFOYLE: I'm in black.BOLLING: DNC, if they decide to do this, they can so it. And there's, there have been four instances where they have done this in the past where a candidate is removed for health reasons or other, and it's replaced --GUILFOYLE: And if --BOLLING: If the DNC -- but here's the issue.GUILFOYLE: And if you are Trump, you want to run against Clinton or Joe Biden?BOLLING: This is going to happen in the next day or two. You know why? Because some --WILLIAMS: Would it --BOLLING: Some ballots have already been sent out.GUILFOYLE: If you are Trump, you want to run against Hillary Clinton or against Joe Biden.WILLIAMS: Oh I thought you were suggesting that Bill Clinton could replace -- I was thinking no, no, you can't do that.GUILFOYLE: thank you, Juan. Go ahead, Bolling.BOLLING: No, I'm done.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: All right, this is a live shot here, yes -- sponsored by the Red Cross. So this is a live shot of her home there, we got Jennifer Griffin there, as well. You know, obviously, been a tremendous amount of interest in terms of how is she doing, is she going to be able to get better to fundraiser in California; Monday and Tuesday canceled there. This is not what you want going right into the debates.GUTFELD: Well, it's also hard because she's been out of the spotlight for so long. And then when she's in the spotlight, this is what happens.PERINO: Interesting.GUILFOYLE: Hmm.GUTFELD: We'll be right back.GUILFOYLE: Thank you.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: A message from our sponsor, my pillow. Maybe she's on one. What's Clinton been doing today? We're going to check it with Jennifer Griffin who is live in her home in New York City, that's next. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Back now to the questions swirling about Hillary Clinton's health. Her campaign initially said that she overheated while attending the 9/11 memorial, yesterday, but later admitted she had been diagnosed days before with pneumonia. Correspondent Jennifer Griffin is outside the democratic nominee's home in Chappaqua, New York, and joins us now. Jennifer, I'm sure you've been besieged with all sorts of requests from people all around Fox News asking you, what's the latest? So now it's our turn. What is the latest?JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, the latest, Dana, is that we're told by her aides that she is at home resting and that she's feeling much better today. Remember, she started that course of antibiotics on Friday, and so those antibiotics should be working at this point. Her doctor issued a statement last night that I really did a double take when I read. Her doctor -- Dr. Laura (ph) Bardack wrote that she had diagnosed her on Friday with pneumonia. When I first read that I thought that she had perhaps diagnosed her when she saw her after the incident in 9/11 yesterday. But in fact, it was on Friday. And of course, nobody from the campaign shared that with any of the traveling press. And in fact, what was also worrisome, and you guys have talked about it, is that the protective pool who was with her at 9/11, they were held for about $90 minutes. They didn't know where they were. They weren't allowed to leave the site and they didn't know other than when our imbed producer who had heard from Rick Leventhal that she had left and had stumbled to the car on the way and had had some sort of medical incident. That protective pool was kept completely in the dark. Today, the campaign has said that they could have handled things better and they have apologized.PERINO: And we're going to take around the table, Jennifer. Kimberly is next.GUILFOYLE: Yes. So Jennifer, everyone wants to know, you know, really what is the, the true story here in terms of any chronic illnesses she has, any kind of, you know, precursors to this. There have been reports of like deep vein thrombosis, hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's disease, clotting disorders, and number of things, and then, of course, a concussion years priors, towards the end of her tenure as secretary of state. When are we going to get like the real firm answer on this, because the pressure is for them to release some more comprehensive records.GRIFFIN: Well, her spokesman Brian Fallon was on the air today, and he said that there is no undisclosed, underlying condition other than pneumonia. Her doctors said that it was the -- she had had a long-term coughing fit. We saw that a week ago. There was the result of allergies and it developed into pneumonia. I just heard from several campaigns sources, just a little while ago, that there are about half a dozen of her top aides who have to had some sort of bug, and so serious that they have in fact ended up several of them in the hospital in recent weeks. So there's something going around campaign headquarters. A spokesman tells me that, that's not what happened to Hillary Clinton. They're not linking that bug. But some of the campaign aides have been on the plane with us. So I think the reason we know about the deep vein thrombosis and the concussion from 2012 is because Hillary Clinton has released some of her medical records. She's under pressure now to release more of those, and we understand from Brian Fallon, her spokesman, that she will be doing so of sometime in the coming weeks.PERINO: And we want to get everyone in here, so have to keep it pretty pithy, Juan.WILLIAMS: Jennifer, now, obviously, Mrs. Clinton was advised by the doctor, not to travel out to California. Is she still doing the fund-raisers by Skype or she's cancelling them all together?GRIFFIN: No. They are not cancelling them. In fact, we just learned that Bill Clinton will fly out to Los Angeles and she -- he will be at those two fund-raisers hosted by Lionel Richie and Barry Diller. She is going to call in by teleconference, we're told tonight to the San Francisco fund-raiser. But she will not be flying. In fact, she'll not be flying out to Las Vegas on Wednesday when she was supposed to give a speech, either.PERINO: All right, Eric?BOLLING: You know Jennifer, when stuff doesn't add up, there -- usually it doesn't add up for a reason. Here's the -- here is the question I have. OK, so, now the campaign and Hillary Clinton know -- they know she has pneumonia. On Friday they know, so Sunday, she's at the memorial. They know she has pneumonia. They see her literally being carried into the van, yet they decide to go to Hillary -- to Chelsea Clinton's apartment, rather than a hospital. Rather than seeking immediate medical attention. There's trauma centers downtown. I know two major trauma centers down there that they could have taken her to. Why did they go to her, to her apartment? Number one; and number two, we didn't see Bill Clinton the whole weekend. Why is that?GRIFFIN: Well, Bill Clinton was here in Chappaqua, we're told. In terms of why they went straight to Chelsea's apartment -- I don't know. For certain, I've asked whether she went to the hospital on Friday, for instance, to get a chest x-ray. And I have not gotten any response. But it's clear that they were concerned about optics. After 90 minutes she walked out of the -- Chelsea's apartment. She looked pretty good, frankly, for someone who had the kind of incident we have seen 90 minutes. She waived to the crowd. She walked on her own. She did not seem to be having trouble walking. I don't know why they didn't take her -- they did -- what we do know is that they did try do contact her doctor right away. They did get her on the phone. And they, they -- she also travels with a secret service agent, who I know has some medical training in addition to being on her service detail.PERINO: All right; Gutfeld, for win.GUTFELD: Jennifer, I -- does Donald Trump have be careful about asking for transparency? I know Thursday. Yes, it's, it's like a pre-emptive physical, right? It's, is to manage kind of the information. Does he have worry that they -- her staff or campaign or the media could ask the same questions of him?GRIFFIN: Well, absolutely. I think the whole problem with both of these candidates is that the public is demanding more transparency. The Clinton campaign is fond of saying that Donald Trump needs to release not just his medical records, but also his taxes. And he wants her to release her e- mails, her private e-mails as well as more of her medical information. So, basically there's a lot of pressure on both candidates to be more transparent.PERINO: All right. Thanks, Jennifer. We love having you on ""The Five."" See you again soon.Another controversy for Clinton, she's also taking heat for calling half of Trump's supporters, deplorable. Trump called that the single biggest mistake of the political season. Is he right? We'll discuss it next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Awful music.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Friday night, the opening act for Barbara Streisand preached the salivating choir, playing one of her recent hits, ""basket of deplorables.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: To be just grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the ""basket of deplorables.""(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Right?(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: The racists, sexists, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Homophobic -- ""basket of deplorables."" Sounds like a Pixar film about Jeffrey Dumb and Dumber jump roar (ph), or the worst thing you could order from Hickory Farms. It insults millions of people, but it's nothing new from Hillary. This is not a gap, it's her plank. Now there are deplorables in every party, but Hillary exaggerated Trump to smear all of his supporters (inaudible), an odd strategy for someone accusing another person of divisiveness. But let's face it, the media and the democrats care more about some deplorables than others. Hate and paranoia exist in place on the right, but these are things the left have offered for years. Anti- Semitism has been excused on the left, as long as it hurts Israel. The left is the only place where cop killers and tyrants end up on t-shirts and a terrorist can throw a fund-raiser for a presidential candidate. Today, as the new right wages war with the old left using the left's worst tactics. Claims of polarization abound, something never raised when it was just the left that was pushing hate and rage inspired by Sir Welensky. Deplorable is what Hillary calls the world now when the right starts acting left.Lastly, 2,997 flags, each representing a death on 9/11, were ripped out of the ground at a California college over the weekend. Whose deplorables did that?So let's just roll Donald Trump's response to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear, demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign.She called half of our supporters a basket of deplorables, in both a speech and an interview. She divides people into baskets, as though they were objects, not human beings.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Mm-hmm.PERINO: Great line. That last line that he had in his speech.The thing is, when Hillary Clinton starts to offer comments, she says, ""Well, to just be grossly generalistic."" So that's a cue...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ... that if you hear yourself about to say that, then don't say whatever you're about to say if you're on camera.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: But if you listen to the reaction of the crowd, she got laughs.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And so she's very comfortable in front of the crowd that Barbra Streisand was hosting.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: Because that crowd is going to laugh at something like that.That's certainly not the Hillary Clinton that you saw that was giving a speech about the alt-right a few weeks ago, which I think was widely considered one of her best speeches of the campaign. And you think, OK, for both of these candidates, who is the real person? Right? So not a good weekend for Hillary Clinton all around.GUTFELD: No, it's true.PERINO: To be grossly generalistic.GUTFELD: That's like saying, ""This may sound racist, but...""PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: Don't say it. Stop right there, if it sounds racist.Kimberly, I have a theory that this gaffe will have no effect, because she's not offending anybody who's going to vote for her. The people that she just insulted...PERINO: Independents.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: Yes. Well, are there still some that are on the fence?PERINO: There are.GUILFOYLE: There are.GUTFELD: All right. Explain.GUILFOYLE: Important votes still out there to get. Independents is the key group that I think, obviously, Trump wants to get some sway with. I think it's going to be key in battleground states, as well.And there's people, quite frankly -- and you've seen some of the polling out there -- where, for example, in states even like Pennsylvania, they like Bill Clinton. They do not like Hillary Clinton.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: And have elected to go for Donald Trump.So you can see this actually matter, especially when you see the polls tightening the way they are. Like, now you see the battleground states mirroring the closeness of the nationwide polls.So again, it's not a predictor of everything. But there are trends you should pay attention to.Also, keep in mind -- yes, some of these are within 3 to 4 percent, margin of error, et cetera. So there's some wiggle room there. But when you are that close in a lot of these battleground states, you've got to pull votes from her.And perhaps you can. Because when you couple her comments with the problem and the doubt, the lingering doubt from everybody about her health, it may be enough to say, ""You know what? Nobody is perfect; and he has said some stuff, but he doesn't seem to be falling down on the trail. One thing. The guy does keep going. And so maybe why not give him a chance?""Kind of like his outreach with the, you know, minority communities and African-American communities: ""What have you got to lose? You've tried them. Look where they've gotten you.""GUTFELD: Eric, is this comparable to Mitt's 47 percent? Yes.BOLLING: I was writing that down. Because we heard it all weekend. But it really is like that.I mean, she insulted -- let's do the math on it. She insulted -- he'll get 60 million-plus votes in the general election. She insulted 30 million people right there, right? So if the general population is 120 million, she insulted 25 percent of the population.Mitt Romney did the same thing when they said -- he had his 47 percent number. Now, it didn't affect his base. In fact, people who saw him as tone deaf and wrong and not someone they would want to vote for. And that is you where get the independents that you're talking about.GUILFOYLE: That was picked up on mic. This was prepared.BOLLING: Her apology was, ""I wish I didn't say 'half'.""GUTFELD: Right.BOLLING: What did she mean by that? Did she mean, ""I wish I'd said all of them""? Fewer than half?GUILFOYLE: Half an apology.WILLIAMS: I can tell you, because I looked at the numbers. Because you know what? To me, it was important that she sharpened the focus on who Trump is a couple weeks out from the debates, Eric.Because he's not a normal conservative. He's not a normal Republican. This is a guy who, according to a Washington Post poll that's out today, 60 percent of Trump supporters are biased against minorities and women, according to the American people. Forty-eight percent say, absolutely.Sixty percent have an unfavorable view of Muslims and want to ban Muslims from coming into the United States, contrary to our Constitution.They think -- a third of Trump's backers think blacks are more criminal. Half of them say blacks are more likely to be violent.And of course, 60 percent are birthers. They don't think President Obama is an American citizen.So when you talk about -- you say, oh, maybe she shouldn't have said this stylistically. Did she insult somebody? No, in fact, she told the truth. Maybe that's the problem.She called out the Trump people who are bigots and said it. And guess what? Just like Dana said, it's not going to hurt her with Democrats. I don't think it's going to -- these numbers indicate it won't even hurt her with independents, because most Americans agree with her.PERINO: It might energize her base.GUTFELD: Well, that's the other strategy, is that they are so bored by her, this is all she has left, is to light a fire on their behinds.BOLLING: Guess what else we didn't talk about all day today?GUTFELD: What?BOLLING: The e-mail scandals.PERINO: That's a heck of a way to change the topic.WILLIAMS: One thing we didn't talk about today, Trump says he doesn't invest in the stock mart. Of course, that's a lie. He invests millions in the stock market. He said that today. We don't even get to talk about it.GUTFELD: You just -- you just were allowed.PERINO: You know what? I think Porter has his run down for tomorrow.GUTFELD: Yes. You're like Colin Kaepernick. You're saying, ""Oh, the injustice."" And we go, ""Sure, go ahead.""Where does America stand in our fight against terror 15 years after 9/11? The Obama administration's take versus Dick Cheney's, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Yesterday while America commemorated the 15th anniversary of 9/11, our homeland security chief gave this optimistic assessment of where we stand now in our terror fight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEH JOHNSON, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: We are stronger against another 9/11-style terrorist directed attack from overseas. Our government has become pretty good at detecting and preventing something hatched from overseas, launched from overseas.We're better than we were 15 years ago. Where we're challenged, however, is with the lone-wolf-style attack. The self-radicalized actor who is here in the homeland. And that's a relatively new environment, and it requires a whole of government response.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Dick Cheney doesn't agree. He warned an even deadlier 9/11-style attack could happen here. The former vice president thinks the world is in greater danger 15 years after 9/11 and blames Obama in a new op-ed, written with his daughter, Liz.Quote, ""No American president has done more to weaken the U.S. The president who came into office promising to end wars has made war more likely. He has ensured that future wars will be longer and put more American lives at risk.""Greg, you've been saying this for a while. Yes.PERINO: Greg concurs.GUTFELD: You know what it is? It's simultaneously safer and less safe.Because that's -- as technology expands, that's what happens. Like, comparing lifespans in the 1940s to the 1040s. You died much younger in 1040. But in the 1940s, you had mass destruction via technology. So fewer people died. But you have the technology to kill more people.So while 9/11s might be fewer, a 9/12 with a magnitude of 10, has a greater chance of occurring.BOLLING: Dana, out of curiosity, why -- I guess 9/11. But Dick Cheney, what's he doing?PERINO: Well, I haven't spoken to him, so I'm not exactly sure. I think that one of the concerns is that if you think of the time period before 9/11, and the military and the intelligence communities had basically been stripped of some resources. And that is one of the things that you have the budget increases of the early 2000s, because we had to build that back up after 9/11.And the worry is always going to be for whoever is president, are we having enough -- do we have enough resources that are being put forward? And also, do we have enough imagination to think about and conceive of what possible threats could be out there?And what Secretary Johnson is saying is that the big catastrophic ones we're not going to have to worry about as much. I don't know if that's true. I hope it's true. He said the lone-wolf ones are a different problem.He Whoever the next president is, is going to need the support of all Americans to figure out how do we fight this threat. Because the transition period will be very dicey.I think what Dick Cheney is saying is that the military option has to be on table. And by constantly taking it off the table, it weakens diplomacy.BOLLING: Well, bring it on.K.G., these guys brought down -- they killed thousands, 3,500, with box cutters.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I know. So listen, when you think about where we are now militarily in terms of a smaller force. Right? We're overcommitted in so many areas. And I think if you talk to anybody who works and is part of our elite special forces teams and units, they will tell you that one of the biggest problems they have right now are the rules of engagement that have hampered them and, in many instances, endangered their lives.And that has been put forward by this administration. I mean, there's direct ties there in terms of it. And you see any of the people, like Marcus Luttrell talked about this quite extensively, that that's something they want to see dialed back.Just that one thing alone, I think, is hugely problematic, because you have an administration that is more concerned about collateral damage than they are at many points about the lives of the men and women, the soldiers on the ground.BOLLING: Are we safer now than we were in the last 15 years?WILLIAMS: Absolutely. I mean, it's like to quote President Bush, we're safer, but we're never completely safe. You can never be completely safe.But you know, the hard facts are that we have DHS, which didn't exist 15 years ago. We've put trillions of dollars into it. Everybody knows about going through the airports.But I think the key point is here not only have we killed bin Laden, degraded al Qaeda, beat down ISIS. I mean, the Patriot Act in which we can look at the Internet, look at financial transactions, we are just a stronger country.But I think it's Dick Cheney and a lot of the Republicans who play on fear and just try to stir people up and use it as a political weapon.And the fact is...GUTFELD: He's not in politics.WILLIAMS: He is in politics.GUTFELD: He doesn't care about politics anymore.WILLIAMS: Oh, no, not at all. Yes.GUTFELD: He just goes out and hunts.WILLIAMS: Let me just say that this is, to me, part of what you have to understand is the changing nature of terrorism and what we have to confront. But to go on -- oh, yes, we're more danger -- I think it's just -- it's just playing on...GUTFELD: Politics is one time, Juan.GUILFOYLE: Look, I said yesterday on 9/11, Dana, remember, Dana, remember, you thanked all the TSA agents. The nice ones at the Reagan Airport. Very good.GUTFELD: Blood's (ph) flying.BOLLING: We need to go.Ahead, more NFL players join Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest and on 9/11 of all days. Will fans stand for this? Get it? Should they sit out their games? Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: This weekend, several more NFL players joined 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's protest of racial inequality. Some Chiefs and Dolphins raised fists or knelt during the national anthem or right afterwards. The league's commissioner, he seems to be OK with it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER: I support our players speaking out on issues they think need to be changed in our society. We don't live in a perfect society. Our players have strong views about things. So I support our players speaking out against that. But that's what the focus should be on, the changes he wants to see in our society.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Well, what about the fans? The hashtag #boycottNFL got a lot of traction on social media this weekend. If players keep sitting out anthems, will fans sit out games?I've got some football fans here. So let me begin. I think you're a football fan.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I am. And a 49er fan, indeed.But you know, look, if you don't want to watch it, then don't, you know, turn on the TV. Don't go to the game if you're upset. Write them. Do whatever you want.But bottom line is, the commissioner is right. They have -- they're OK to do it. There's no rule prohibiting somebody engaging in this kind of discourse, you know, by saying, ""I'm going to take a knee or I want to sit it out."" It just depends how you feel about it as a fan.WILLIAMS: OK.GUILFOYLE: OK. I don't like it. But that's me.WILLIAMS: I think your Giants did well yesterday. How did you feel about this?BOLLING: Remember, I'm a football fan. Giants I like as well as every single other team in the league.Here's my problem. Yes, you're right, but they can change that. They can have clauses put into these contracts that say, ""You will stand for the national anthem. If you don't like it, too bad."" We won't -- you can put a clause. There are morality clauses in contracts.WILLIAMS: But there's none there. But there's none there now.BOLLING: So maybe going forward, you can start to do that.My problem is when Victor Cruz and -- and the other wide receiver for the Giants, put some pro-9/11 thing on their cleats.GUTFELD: Right.BOLLING: They got fined $6,000 for doing it. I mean, if you're going to let these idiots...GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: ... kneel during the national anthem, let Victor Cruz and Dale Beckham (ph) Jr., I guess it was.GUTFELD: And a Titan linebacker did the same thing.BOLLING: Let them do that.GUILFOYLE: I love Victor Cruz.BOLLING: And display pro-patriotism, too.WILLIAMS: Well, and Dana Perino, you're a big football fan, as I know well.GUILFOYLE: She picks all the winning teams.PERINO: I do. I always pick a winner.GUILFOYLE: Great record.PERINO: I don't know to boycott. I just -- I don't think that they have thought through long-term consequences of their actions. What will it take for them to stand? What are they going to -- is this a permanent thing for them?And I don't think they understand the impact of their actions not just on younger people but think of those guys, those vets, the greatest generation, and how sad they must be watching all of this.WILLIAMS: Greg, in fact, to pick up on Dana's points, a lot of younger people now, you see high school teams now starting to pick up on the same thing.GUTFELD: The reason why those -- some of the players were linking arms, that was an impression of Hillary.Look, you know why a lot of these players are supporting Colin? Because the level of risk is so low. Sitting is not really free speech. Those men fought, soldiers fought and died for the right for you to be offensive. They're not offensive. If they were offensive, they would do something else. They would do the robot during ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" or the national anthem. They would do something deeply offensive.To me, I think they're cowards. I defend the very worst kind of free speech. And this is what you give me? You sit down. Why? Because you are too scared. Colin's too scared to stand. Why doesn't he stand up and just give the finger? Why doesn't he do something so deeply offensive? Because he's scared, so he does this little thing where he sits down.Just one last point about Colin. One obvious point, maybe he's just stupid. And why is it -- why is it the problem with this world that we must engage the dumb? Because it's on TV. So he does a stupid thing, and we engage it. Maybe he's just not bright.WILLIAMS: But he certainly has a platform. The question is, is he persuading anyone or just polarizing people already angry?GUTFELD: Do some real free speech.WILLIAMS: All right.GUTFELD: Do something really offensive.WILLIAMS: ""One More Thing"" coming right at you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" Wait until you see what's coming up -- Juan.WILLIAMS: OK. So imagine that I'm Greg Gutfeld, and I hate birthdays. That's right. It's Greg's birthday. And I took the risk, because nobody else was willing to do it, to say happy birthday, Gregory. There's Gregory and me when he was wearing a unicorn outfit. And so guess what we're doing today for his birthday? Look at this.GUTFELD: This was a beautiful ensemble. It's a -- it's a bubble wrap suit...WILLIAMS: You look lovely.GUTFELD: ... that was sent to me, because people know how much I love bubble wrap. I call this, actually, my birthday suit. What I do on my birthday is...GUTFELD: Thank God you have clothes under this.GUTFELD: ... I put this on, and I head over to Lou Dobbs' place. And he gets in his bare feet in a Speedo, and he just walks all over my body. And I don't leave until everything is popped.WILLIAMS: When Greg first got this, he said to me, does my -- look big in this? No, you look lovely.GUTFELD: Doesn't that sound great?WILLIAMS: Terrific.GUILFOYLE: Poor Lou. OK. Greg, does that count as your ""One More Thing""?GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Thank God.OK. So I have something really incredible this weekend. I was -- ability to go to D.C. to honor a great friend of mine, Dr. William Bennett, at the Faith, Freedom and Family gala dinner. Dr. Bennett received the well- deserved Family Research Council Vision and Leadership Award. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: I can think of no American more deserving of the Vision and Leadership Award than Dr. William J. Bennett. Congratulations, my dear friend, to you and to your wonderful family. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.DR. WILLIAM J. BENNETT, AWARD RECIPIENT: She makes a great point, a lawyer point, philosopher point, a mother's point. Kimberly, it's a pleasure to know you, and thank you for taking care of my boys.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: I just want to say, thank you again for having me there. Wonderful family. And your wife, Elaine, as well. We're all very proud of you. We do enjoy seeing you on ""The Kelly File"" so very much.BOLLING: Cool. Congratulations.GUILFOYLE: Thank you.BOLLING: And to you, Bill Bennett.OK, so Saturday night, you know, with all the bad news with the national anthems lately, take a look at this. This is the largest crowd ever at an American football game; 157,000 people showed up for Tennessee/Virginia Tech at Bristol Motor Speedway. Turned into a football field. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(MUSIC: ""THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER"")(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: That was amazing.All right, Dana, we saved some time.PERINO: OK. So I believe in trying new things. I just want to give a little shout-out to the Palmetto Blast Tennis Club. That's Mike Siklas (ph) and Michael Goola (ph). Mike is the pro.And then I have a picture of Natalie Mathis (ph), who is the pro's assistant and Carol Crow (ph). They're all part of the tennis club. And they helped me to the point that, in four months, I was able to play doubles, and I won. But only because I chose a really good partner. Thanks, guys.GUILFOYLE: OK. All right, Greg, be yourself. That's it for us. ""Special Report"" is next. Happy birthday.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

With voting in Iowa and New Hampshire now just a month ago, the establishment Republicans get personal.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)GOV.

MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You know, Chris has been missing in New Jersey for half the time.  AD NARRATOR:  Marco Rubio was missing, fund-raising in California instead.  WALLACE:  We'll talk with two candidates for whom the early contests could be do or die, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and the onetime Republican front-runner, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.  Christie and Bush, only on ""Fox News Sunday.""Then --BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We know we can't stop every act of violence, but what if we tried to stop even one.  WALLACE:  Our Sunday group on the president's plan to go around Congress again and take executive action on gun control, and their predictions for 2016.  All right now on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  2016 is finally here.  And with the Iowa caucuses and then the New Hampshire primary just a month away, we begin the New Year with two candidates who have a lot riding on the early states: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.  First, Governor Christie, who has spent more time in New Hampshire than any of the other Republican candidates.  Governor, happy New Year and welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""  CHRISTIE:  Happy New Year to you, Chris, and looking forward to getting back to New Hampshire this afternoon.  WALLACE:  Well, as we said, you went after Marco Rubio this week, saying, ""Dude, show up for work or quit,"" which brought a lot of heavy fire.  Check it out.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO:  Chris Christie is a funny guy, but he's never in New Jersey.  He's gone half the time.  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The people in New Jersey want to throw him out of office.  We're going to hell and the governor of is in New Hampshire every day have been town hall meetings.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Now, New Jersey reporters have researched this.  They say you've been away from New Jersey for all or part of 72 percent of the time since you announced you were running for president.  When you look at the total, over 200 days in 2015, which raises the question -- who are you to criticize?  CHRISTIE:  I'm on the job every day, Chris.  And what -- that's the difference between being a governor and being a senator.  You know, I'm on the job every day.  Senator Rubio just hasn't shown up to vote.  And, listen, I understand he can't be there for every day, he's running for president.  I get that.  But, you know, there was a $1.15 trillion spending bill which he said he was absolutely opposed to.  I would think he would take one day off of fund-raising to cast his no vote and speak on the floor to try to persuade had is colleagues.But anybody who has been a governor, and anyone who hasn't been I understand don't understand this, I am on the job every day no matter where I am.  There's never a day off and I'm always working to help the people of New Jersey to do my job.WALLACE:  You say you're on the job every day, but I've got to tell you, and it's something you know, you're getting hammered in New Jersey for being away so much. The Asbury Park Press issued this report card on New Year's Day.  They gave you a ""D"" overall, a ""D"" on the economy and jobs, and a D-minus on leadership, complained about your being away so much.  And in the latest poll, your approval numbers are the worse since you became governor, 33 percent approve, 62 percent disapprove.  Governor, these are the people of New Jersey who know you best.  CHRISTIE:  Well, listen, I'm not shocked that a liberal newspaper gives mess those grades, but let's talk about the facts.  They gave me that grade on jobs, yet New Jersey in 2015, without the December numbers, Chris, already has had the best job growth year in the private sector it's had in 15 years, the best year since 2000.  So, this is obviously just partisanship on their part, because if they look at the numbers, I've done better than the last five governors have done in New Jersey in terms of job creation.  So, they're just dead wrong on that.And as for the other stuff, you know, the fact is whenever you're looking for a new job, your current employer gets a little miffed.  I get that.  But I was very honest with the people in New Jersey in 2013, when I ran for reelection.  I told them there was a possibility I would run for president.  So, I've told them the truth and if they're a little miffed about it now, I completely understand that.  It's understandable, but I'm working hard to become the next president of the United States.  WALLACE:  Well, let's talk about that because you are surging, especially in New Hampshire.  According to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, in late October, you were running ninth at 3 percent.  Now you're running fourth with 11.3 percent.  And the question is, Governor -- what's happened?  CHRISTIE:  I think it's paying off.  The hard work, all the time that I spent, Mary Pat has spent in the state of New Hampshire, putting forward a really clear strong vision for putting homeland security first.  You know, Chris, when you listen to the president of the United States and he says the reason people are so anxious is because they're watching too much cable news and that the only problem with his strategy on ISIS is that if fact he needs a better PR strategy and then Mrs. Clinton says a week or two ago we're exactly where we need to be on ISIS, they want a strong federal former prosecutor and governor who understands how to get in job done.  I think that's what the people in New Hampshire are responding to, and I can tell you, I feel it in Iowa, too, just having just come back from there a few days ago.  WALLACE:  Well, as we said, you have spent more time in New Hampshire than any of the Republican candidates, the conventional wisdom is that New Hampshire is terribly important for you, you either have to finish first or if second, you have to finish ahead of the other so-called establishment candidates like Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush.  Is it win or out for you in New Hampshire?  CHRISTIE:  Absolutely not, Chris.  I mean, listen, you said it yourself, in October, we were in ninth place in New Hampshire.  We're now, you know, third or fourth, depending on what poll you look at.  The fact is we just need to do well there, and we need to do well in Iowa, too.  And I think we'll do well in both places, and then we'll be able to move on, this field will be narrowed to four, five folks I suspect after New Hampshire.  We're going to be in that four or five and we're going to be ready to compete around the country.  WALLACE:  So, not to get too process-y, but this is that time of the year.  If you were to finish behind one of the other establishment candidates like Rubio, like Bush, you could still survive?  CHRISTIE:  Of course.  WALLACE:  OK.  That's a quick answer.  (CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE:  Because I'm note going to see too process-y, Chris.  WALLACE:  One of the things you pointed out is terrorism and a strong leader in fighting terrorism is a big issue.  It's one of the issues that you are running on.  Here you are at the last Republican debate.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIE:  We prosecuted two of the biggest terrorism cases in the world and stopped Ft. Dix by being attacked by six radicalized Muslims from a mosque in New Jersey.I'm the only person on the stage who has filed applications under the Patriot Act, who have gone before the federal -- the Foreign Intelligence Service Court.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But critics say that you have, quite frankly, greatly exaggerated your record on this.  First, your claim that you personally went before -- we just heard you say personally went before the FISA court to get national security wiretaps.  The truth is you never did that.  CHRISTIE:  Our office went before it.  We provided all the information and I needed to sign off on all the information to provide to the Justice Department so they could go before it and get the information we need, that we requested based on our investigation, Chris.  These are -- if you look at those criticisms, there are two things they have in common -- one, they're working for others candidates.  And two they have never done a lick of work for the Department of Justice.  All of those people who have ever done any professional work for the Department of Justice didn't have those complaints and they knew exactly what I meant.  WALLACE:  All right.  Second, and it's not just frankly your other rivals saying this, also independent -- New York Times, if they're not working --  (LAUGHTER)WALLACE:  If they're not working for the other candidate, they're certainly not favorable to you, but I don't think they're working for one of the other Republicans.  They say, The New York Times does, that you claim that you prosecuted, and we just heard the clip, two of the biggest terrorism cases in the world.  Now, I want to make it clear there's no question you have a report of fighting terrorism, but those particular cases that you cite were both FBI stings where the people involved were under surveillance for months.  Well, it was the Lakhani case and Ft. Dix case and there was nothing close to an actual attack, sir.  CHRISTIE:  Chris, you're half right.  The Lakhani case was a sting case; but not the Ft. Dix Six case was not a sting case.  Once we received the intelligence that was done from the hard work of the people in the FBI and our office, we were then able to monitor those folks, but the plans were already under way for them to attack Ft. Dix.  WALLACE:  But they were under surveillance --  CHRISTIE:  So, you're just wrong on the second part.  WALLACE:  They were under surveillance for months, were they not, sir?  CHRISTIE:  But, Chris, that's our job.  I mean, would you rather have the Boston bombing, where people were not under surveillance, that people were killed and maimed?  WALLACE:  No, I --  CHRISTIE:  And those folks were planning for quite some time, too.  That -- what we did with Ft. Dix, these were people who had already begun to plan an attack.  They had already begun to plan an attack.  They had begun to train.  We had video of them training for this attack.  We then began to surveil them.  That's what modern law enforcement is supposed to be, something the Obama administration obviously doesn't understand.  And I do understand it because I've done it.  And so, to try to minimize the Ft. Dix Six case is being done by The New York Times who, by the way, eight weeks ago called for me to drop out of the race.  So I hardly think they're an objective source.  WALLACE:  Finally, I got to say, you're in mid-season form.  Finally, President Obama --  CHRISTIE:  Thank you, my friend.  WALLACE:  -- is expected to announce executive action on new gun controls this week to expand background checks, and also to bar more accused domestic abusers from being able to buy guns.  Your reaction to that?  CHRISTIE:  This president is a petulant child.  Whenever we can get what he wants because quite frankly, the American people have rejected his agenda by turning both the House and the Senate over to the Republicans, and going from 21 governors when he came into office, the 31 Republican governors now, now this president wants to act as if he is a king, as if he is a dictator.  The fact is if he wants to make changes these laws, go to Congress and convince the Congress that they're necessary.  But this is going to be another illegal executive action which I'm sure will be rejected by the courts.  And when I become president, will be stricken from executive action, by executive action I will take.  WALLACE:  But the report seemed to case, sir, that you have flipped on gun control.  They know, critics do, in 2013 when you were running for reelection, that you signed ten bills tightening gun restrictions, including banning handgun purchases by people on the terror watch list and the NRA that year when you were running for reelection only gave you a ""C"".  And they say, critics do, and some of them, yes, your rivals, say that you have changed your tune on gun control since you started running for president.  CHRISTIE:  I haven't changed my tune, Chris.  In fact, I signed is the bill that banned guns on the terror watch list.  As president, I would make sure that terror watch list was actually accurate.  But I think most Americans believe if you're on the terror watch list, you shouldn't be able to buy guns.But I also have vetoed the 50-caliber rifle ban, I've also vetoed a statewide ID system.  I've also vetoed a reduction in the magazine ban, and I've also pardoned six different folks so far who have been caught up very unfairly in my view in New Jersey's gun laws.  So, listen, the approach I'm going to take is to protect Second Amendment rights but make sure I make decisions that are in the best interests of the people of New Jersey.  I think that's what the people of the United States want.  That's the kind of president I'm going to be.  WALLACE:  Governor, thank you.  Thanks for your time.  Happy New Year, and we will see you on the campaign trail.  CHRISTIE:  Happy New Year to you, too, Chris, and I like forward to being on again.  WALLACE:  Good.  Up next, a shift in campaign strategy for Jeb Bush, as the former front-runner tries to regain his momentum.  What went wrong and how does he turn it around?  That's next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Jeb Bush shook up his campaign again this week, cancelling ad buys in Iowa and South Carolina, and deploying almost all his head quarter staff to the early voting states.  There's growing talk in the Bush camp New Hampshire may now be a must-win state.  Governor Bush joins us from Miami.  And welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday,"" sir.  JEB BUSH, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Thank you, Chris.  WALLACE:  Let's start where we left off with Chris Christie.  Your thoughts about President Obama's planned executive actions on gun control.  BUSH:  Well, I haven't seen them, but his first impulse is always to take rights away from law-abiding citizens, and it's wrong.  And to use executive powers he doesn't have is a pattern that' is quite dangerous.  It's not a surprise that people don't believe that our government is working on their behalf any more when you have a president that recklessly uses executive authority that the Constitution doesn't provide him.A better approach would be the approach that I had when I was governor of the state Florida, where we focused on punishing people that committed crimes with guns, but we enhanced and protected the Second Amendment rights for law-abiding citizens.  WALLACE:  But, Governor, let's talk about a couple of these specific ideas that it seems from all the reporting that President Obama is likely to propose as early as this week.  Expand the number of gun sellers who have to conduct background checks.  Expand the number of accused domestic abusers who are barred from buys guns.  Governor, what's wrong with those specific ideas?  BUSH:  Well, because you don't know the details, but the so-called gun show loophole which I think what he's talking about doesn't exist.  People that want to sell random -- you know, occasionally sell guns ought to have the right to do so without being impaired by the federal government.  If states want to create specific rules around that kind of behavior -- fine.  As it relates to domestic violence, the state of Florida when I was governor did exactly what he's suggesting, but this top-down driven approach doesn't create freedom, doesn't create safety, doesn't create security.  And that's what we ought to be focused on.  WALLACE:  But let's go back, because you're saying basically you agree with him on the domestic abuse.  You just don't like the way --BUSH:  No, because he can't do it by executive order, Chris.WALLACE:  I understand you don't like the process.  BUSH:  I went to the legislature.  I got it passed and I signed into law, and it was a good law and people are safer because of it.  WALLACE:  But what about the background checks?  And again, we're not talking about the father selling a .22 to his gun.  But if somebody --BUSH:  How do you know?  WALLACE:  -- if somebody sells a few guns and wants to sell a gun to somebody, who does it hurt for the seller -- or rather the buyer to go through a background check?  BUSH:  If it's just an occasional question where you're getting federal license from a person who's going to sell one or two guns, I think that's completely inappropriate.  We're a bottom up country, we're not a top-down country.  And he doesn't have the authority to do this, anyway.  If it's such a great idea, let him go to Congress.  My belief is, the best approach is to have the laws be thoroughly vetted at the state level.  And that's why I'm proud of the fact I have perhaps the most pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment record as a governor of any state in the country.  It's why I was statesman of the year of the NRA.  I received an award from Charlton Heston about 10 years ago.And we cut down gun violence at the same time.  That should be the approach.  WALLACE:  You started 2015 as the front-runner with about $100 million in your super PAC war chest, but things changed during the course of 2015.  As late as July, you led the field nationally with almost 18 percent.  Now, you're running sixth nationally, and you've seen basically the same drop in Iowa and New Hampshire.  And all of this, Governor, while you and your campaign and your super PAC has spent about a third of the campaign dollars that were spent in 2015 and you and your super PAC has spent double what any other Republican candidate has spent.  Which raises the question -- what happened to your campaign this last year, sir?  BUSH:  Well, I'm going to focus on what's going to happen in the next month in the Iowa caucuses and then ten days after that in New Hampshire.  That's our focus right now.  And in South Carolina, we're building a strong team, voter contacts is really what counts in those states.  We're surging in terms of identifying voters and going at it.  As you said, we moved many of the people in our headquarters out to these early states.  Advertising in this world doesn't work to the same extent it probably did in the past, and so, we're making adjustments.  That's what I'm focused on.  I'm focused on my proven record and the need to have a person with a steady hand that can be able to take on these big challenges going forward and have specific plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C., and grow our economy again and keep us safe.  WALLACE:  But part of -- if you're going to fix the mess in Washington is learning from mistakes, and fixing in this case your own campaign.  And I guess the question is, did you squander of advantages that you had early in 2015?  Did you fail to come up with a compelling message for voters?  Did you fail to show up in the early debates, sir?I mean, I understand you want to talk about the future, but the past does give some indication as to what went wrong and what you need to improve.  BUSH: Look, Chris, I respect your world.  Your world is all about process.  My world is about connecting with voters in these early states to build momentum.  We have a national campaign.  We're going to be on every ballot in every state.  That's not a hard thing to do.  Not every candidate has done that and now, we're focused on Iowa and New Hampshire.  We've had made the adjustments because that's the reality that we're in today.  And I'm very optimistic that when people see my record and see the ideas you have and see my personality, my character as a candidate and they can envision someone like me can be president during these incredibly dangerous times that we're in, that I'm going to do fine.WALLACE:  But, sir, respectfully again, it is not about process.  You talked about connecting with voters.  I think the polls would indicate you failed to connect with voters in 2015.  Why is that?(CROSSTALK)BUSH:  Well, Chris, let's let -- let's let people in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina and Nevada decide that.  Nevadans I think have a right to be able to make that decision, not the pundits' request.  And that's my point.  WALLACE:  OK.  Back in 2014, when you were considering a run for president, you said the key was, could you run campaign for president, joyfully?  It's a theme that you repeated often.  Here you are.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BUSH:  Can you do it, in my case, that means can one do it joyfully?  Can -- without tied to all of the convention of the politics of the here and now.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Governor, do you still feel that way, that you need to campaign joyfully?  BUSH:  Yes, and I do that.  I'm excited about the future of this country if we fix a few big complex things.  The joy in my heart relates to the greatness of this country.  I believe in the greatness of our country and I believe in its future, but Washington, D.C. is broken.  And the joy I have is the prospect of being president to fix the mess in Washington and then work with Congress on how we tax and regulate, and build a security system around us so that we can be kept safe again.  WALLACE:  The reason I asked is we looked at a couple of your recent ads just in the last month, and we some found clips on them.  I'd like to play them.  These are ads not from the super PAC but from the Bush campaign in the last couple weeks.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, CAMPAIGN VIDEO)JOHN HEILEMANN, BLOOMBERG POLITICS:  Are you an Old Testament guy or New Testament guy?TRUMP:  Probably equal.  MARTHA MCCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  One of the things you didn't take an opportunity to do last night was really go after Donald Trump.  MODERATOR:  Senator Cruz, you have not been willing to attack Mr. Trump in public, but you questioned his judgment --TRUMP:  You better not attack.SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I salute Donald Trump --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Jeb Bush was the only one who try to do go after Donald Trump.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  I mean, you couldn't see them, Governor, but in the course of those ads, you attacked Trump, Rubio, Cruz.  And I guess the question is, what happened to joyful?  BUSH:  You can be joyful and also point out the differences.  I want to be president of the United States, so that I can fix these things.  Donald Trump I don't believe is going to be the party's nominee.  If he is, he's going to get crushed by Hillary Clinton, and I wanted to point that out.He said some things that are just outrageous.  His views on policy have shifted with the winds.  He is a strong supporter until recently of Hillary Clinton and now, he's the front running candidate for the Republican nomination?  Someone has to call him out.  WALLACE:  As we mentioned at the beginning, you have shifted really the third overhaul of your campaign in 2015.  You have basically ended, canceled all of your ad buys in Iowa and South Carolina.  You've deployed almost all of your headquarter staff to the early states.  Same question I asked Chris Christie.  New Hampshire would seem to be terribly important for you.  Don't you have to finish first or at least ahead of the other so-called establishment candidates?  BUSH:  Look, I have no control over the -- how you measure, you know, who's up and who's down.  I'm going to focus on doing the best I can.  I believe we're going to do really well in New Hampshire and that's my goal.  I have a campaign organization in every state of the country.  We're going to be on the ballot everywhere.  This could go a long, long way.  I have no clue about that.  I just have to act on my heart and work as hard as I can.  And I'm excited about the start of this New Year and look forward to campaigning hard in Iowa and in New Hampshire and in South Carolina and Nevada.  WALLACE:  But -- and, final question, sir, you were the one as head of the campaign who made the decision.  Why did you decide to cancel the ad buys in two states, keep them up in New Hampshire, and basically get everybody out of the headquarters in Florida?  BUSH:  Well, based on the fact -- based on what we know, the Right to Rise PAC continues to do advertising on television, and we ought to be focused on voter contact.  And so, it was an adjustment based on the reality of where we are.  That's how leaders lead.  WALLACE:  Does that indicate that you think you have less of a chance in Iowa and South Carolina, putting more eggs in New Hampshire?  BUSH:  No.  No, because we're excited about Iowa and South Carolina as well.  Look, we want to go identify every voter and make sure they go out to vote.  The way you do that is the old-fashioned way in these early states.  And that's the mission and that's the objective, and I'm pretty confident about where we are.  WALLACE:  Governor, thank you.  Happy New Year.  Safe travels on the campaign trail, sir.  BUSH:  Look forward to seeing you.  WALLACE:  Up next, our Sunday group tackles President Obama's plan to use executive action again, this time to impose tougher gun controls.  Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president going it alone.  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, our Sunday group weighs in on the face-off between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  And the husband's one of the greatest abusers of the world.  HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We shouldn't let anybody bully his way into the presidency.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  How will their fight play with women voters?  That's next on ""Fox News Sunday.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA:  A few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence.  And on Monday, I'll meet with our attorney general, Loretta Lynch, to discuss our options.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  President Obama in his weekly address on his plan to take executive action on gun control, likely as soon as this week.  And it's time now for our Sunday group: radio talk show host Laura Ingraham, Susan Page of USA Today, head of Heritage Action for America, Michael Needham, and USA Today columnist Kirsten Powers.  Happy New Year to all of you.We asked you for a questions for the panel and we got one on -- actually a bunch but like this one on Facebook from Jack Abbatiello.  He writes, ""Do you think Congress will stand up to Obama's lawless executive action on gun control?  Or will we have to vote out the GOP leadership this year?""Laura, how do you answer Jack both about the president's executive actions, and also about what, if anything, congressional Republicans can do?  LAURA INGRAHAM, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the power to enact laws.  The president has abused this power.  The Republicans have largely allowed him to do so.  On this issue, given where the Republican Party and Republican voters are, if the Republicans do not stand up to this in a meaningful and smart way, with facts, debunking all the lies, the gun show loopholes, Jeb Bush was right about that -- if they do not do that, I think you would not be able to underestimate the wrath of the American voter next November in a lot of the key Senate races, which I know we've talked about before on the show.This is an issue about liberty and about law-abiding gun owners stopping crime, being allowed to live in freedom.  You want to give a gift of a gun to a son, and now the federal government wants to create perhaps a national database, which would allow this gun control legislation through executive action to be meaningful.  They would need a national database for gun owners, 300 million guns in the United States today.  Look at what Texas did at the end of the year.  They have a new pro-Second Amendment legislative regime in place in Texas.  Similarly in Florida, they're considering the same concealed-carry law.  So I think the president is trying to overreach in his last year in Congress.  WALLACE:  What I heard you say is stand up and then you said, well, they should have facts or hearings.  Is there any way they can stop it?INGRAHAM:  They'll have to go to the courts.  I mean, and we know the course now are very unreliability on some of these constitutional issues.  and I think it has to become a campaign issue for 2016.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  So in terms of the president's action, because if it's a court, it certainly will not get done before Barack Obama leaves office.  They cannot stop him.INGRAHAM:  That's why we don't want to fund the government through like next September/October.  That's why you don't take funding off the table.  That's why you don't unilaterally disarm yourself in these types of debates, which is what grassroots conservatives have complained about, vis a vis folks like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell.  This is going to bring up a whole series of issues, with a split within the Republican Party on tactics.  Not so much on substance, but on tactics.  WALLACE:  Kirsten.KIRSTEN POWERS, USA TODAY:  There's two different audiences for this, of course.  It's not surprising that the Republican base will be upset about this if President Obama does it, but the country overall in terms of gun rights has sort of moved more in favor of having some sort of curbs on gun rights, which is a shift.  It hasn't always been that way.  And we've seen it I think with Hillary starting to shift how she's talking about gun rights from 2008 to now.  She's much more in favor of some sort of gun control.  And I think, you know, if you look at universal background checks, that has 90 percent approval rating in this country, so it's not something that is really I think is going to be seen by most Americans as some major constitutional crisis, as I think it will be seen -- I agree with Laura, it will be seen that way among the base of the Republican Party and probably very good for Donald Trump, if you want to look at it politically.  MICHAEL NEEDHAM, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA:  A national gun registry though doesn't have that support.  When people talk about universal background checks, that's code for a national gun registry, which is what's necessary to actually set it up.  President Obama is actually getting what he wants out of this conversation, though.  This entire conversation about gun control is a distraction from the real issue that makes Americans unsafe right now.  That's radical Islamic terrorism.  President Obama's foreign policy is a failure.  He's distracting from the failure of his foreign policy by talking about gun control.  None of the gun control measures he talks about would have done anything to stop any of the tragedies that we have seen during the last couple of years.  So this is a distraction from the real issue, which is the failure of the policy of leading from behind that summarizes Barack Obama's foreign policy.  WALLACE:  The place where these two kind of get together, Susan, is after San Bernardino, on the one hand, Kirsten is right, on some issues like a background check, people generally favor that.  On the other hand, there was an explosion in gun sales after San Bernardino, because people are afraid, and even -- I saw a report on the news today, that after news of the executive action, there was a gun show out in Virginia, and people were there like more than usual to buy guns, because they're worried their guns are going to be taken away or they won't be able to buy new guns.SUSAN PAGE, USA TODAY:  Just to be clear, we don't know precisely what President Obama is going to propose.  I don't believe he's proposed a national gun registry to date.  There were some cases, including in a Morgantown case, where the lack of a background check had an effect.  A convicted felon bought a gun that he used to kill four people through Facebook, not subject to a  background check.That aside, I think the politics have gotten incredibly complicated, because as Kristen said, nine out of ten Americans support universal background checks.  On the other hand, there was a poll about a month ago that showed a plurality of Americans we'll be safer if we got more guns rather than restricted guns more.  So people I think are divided on this issue.I would look not for what President Obama does.  I would look for what Hillary Clinton does, because she's running for election.  She hopes to be running for president.  Does she continue to take -- to lean forward into this issue in a way that Democrats have not done for about a generation?WALLACE:  I was going to say, it's a good issue for a Democrat in a primary, particularly against Bernie Sanders, who is more conservative on guns.  It has not, at least in the 2000s, have been a good issue--PAGE:  (INAUDIBLE) support is with people who oppose new restrictions on guns, even when a majority of Americans support some of those restrictions.  INGRAHAM:  Crime has gone down across the country.  There have been spikes in murder rates.  Chicago, they just released the statistics, 50 more murders than in 2014, most strict antigun jurisdiction in Chicago.  The 90 percent statistics of all supporting background checks, that's been debunked.  Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place, and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C.This is about power.  It's not about liberty.  It's not about keeping people safe.  Columbine is the only thing they can point to that would have been changed with gun control.  And that was the transfer of a weapon that was illegally modified under the '94 assault weapons ban.  Newtown wouldn't have been stopped.  Gabby Giffords wouldn't have been stopped, Aurora wouldn't have been stopped, Navy Yard would not have been stopped, so you're going to hear a lot of powerful rhetoric from the president, but when you dig down into the facts and the peer-reviewed studies, it's on the side of the gun owners and the Second Amendment.  WALLACE:  All right.  Meanwhile, the two front-runners in the 2016 race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have continued their battle over the women's issue, and Donald Trump this week upped the ante considerably.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  I don't know that he has any boundaries at all.  And his bigotry, his bluster, his bullying have become his campaign.  TRUMP:  She wants to accuse me of things, and the husband is the one of the great abusers of the world?  Give me a break.  Give me a break.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Michael, wise or not to get back into Bill Clinton's personal history?NEEDHAM:  Well, look, if Hillary Clinton is going to put Bill Clinton out there and have him campaign for her, then nobody's claiming that Hillary is responsible for his misdeeds, but if she's putting him out there as a spokesperson, then it's certainly going to be an issue, and I think one of the most exciting things is that you see for the first time this cycle, the Republican Party willing to be on offense, on moral issues.  You have Rand Paul in New Hampshire, who is saying that the Democrats want to come up with every single obscure instance of abortion and quiz us on that, we're going to ask Hillary Clinton why she supports the abortion of a seven-pound baby.  You have Ted Cruz leading the fight on religious liberty, saying that regardless of what you think of the Supreme Court case this past summer, it's absurd to say that a 70-year-old grandmother should be forced to bake a cake, and I think that if Hillary Clinton wants to put Bill Clinton out there, as one of the leading advocates for her presidency, it's valid to point out that there's nobody who has done more to degrade women or the office of the president of the United States than Bill Clinton.  WALLACE:  How do you think that works?  I mean, there are even some liberal columnists this week who said he's fair game.  And they also questioned Hillary Clinton and the fact that in a lot of these cases she may have enabled Bill Clinton, because she ended up attacking the women who made allegations about Bill Clinton.  PAGE:  So Ruth Marcus, our friend Ruth Marcus, made this point.  I think it's fine, I think it's fair game to talk about Bill Clinton.  Is it smart politics?  I think probably not.  Didn't we see this movie before in 1998, when Bill Clinton himself was the figure at the center, not his spouse, got impeached, contributed to historic Democratic gains in the 1998 midterms?  So I think Donald Trump should feel free to attack him, but I question whether this is going to rebound to his benefit, in a general election where independent-minded women, including moderate Republican women, may be in play and are key to the election.  INGRAHAM:  Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, these are real people.  Their lives were forever changed.  (CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM:  Monica Lewinsky.  Juanita Broaddrick actually claims that Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her.  I interviewed her in years past, contemporaneous corroboration of what she went through.  These are real people.  We have a lot of feminists out there watching, I think a few at least, and they care about women.  I'm not saying this is going to be the focus of the campaign, or necessarily that it should be, but the idea that somehow Bill Clinton is this vaunted figure that he should be taken off the realm of possible, you know, subject matters and discussion, he will be the co-president, he's going to be the most trusted adviser of Hillary Clinton, in a manner of speaking.  A former president of the United States.  He's not going to be the focus of the campaign, but the idea that you can't talk about this?  My question is why aren't other Republican candidates making the speeches of the Clintons, the amassing of the wealth through the Clinton foundation, possibility use of influence from other countries, trying to donate to the Clinton foundation?  These are real topics.  The other issue is going to be brought up, but it shouldn't be something like oh, it's a black box you can't go into.  WALLACE:  Finally, I cannot let this pass.  Put this up.  Carly Fiorina tweeted this on New Year's Day.  ""Love my alma mater, but rooting for a Hawkeyes win today.""  Here is the back story.  Fiorina went to Stanford University, good school.  It just so happened that very same day, Stanford was playing the Iowa Hawkeyes in the Rose Bowl.  Two footnotes.  Stanford crushed Iowa, 45:16, and on Twitter, I'm told by people who understand these things, there were two items trending later that day.  One was pandering, and the other was #carlycurse.  As a proud graduate of Stanford, Michael, your thoughts.  NEEDHAM:  It was pandering.  I think it reminds people that a lot of Republican establishment politicians love throwing their base under the bus to try to appeal to a new constituency.  And that's what she did.  I think people want politicians who are going to speak truth.  The truth is that Stanford proved they should have been in the BCS playoffs.  The truth is that Christian McCaffrey should have won the Heisman trophy --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  I have to say I find it odd that the big insignia -- what kind of a tree is it?  NEEDHAM:  It's a -- it's a California redwood.  It used to be --(CROSSTALK)NEEDHAM:  Remember, in 2008, Rudy Giuliani came out and said he was supporting the Boston Red Sox, in the World Series, the biggest Yankee fan in the world.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  We have to take a break here.  When we come back, the action really begins as our Sunday group gives us their predictions for 2016.  You won't want to miss it.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  We have a tradition around here to have the panel make some predictions for the new year on a range of topics and under the heading often in error, but never in doubt.  Let's get to it.  Politics first.  Laura?  INGRAHAM:  I think the highlight of the Democratic National Convention will be the speech by former President Bill Clinton.  And I think for three Republican conventions in a row, Republicans will not hear from a former Republican president.  WALLACE:  That of course means the only living former presidents are the Bushes, so no Bushes?INGRAHAM:  No Bushes.  If Jeb is the nominee, I think he wants to be his own man.  And if Cruz or Trump or Christie, I don't see it.  PAGE:  Interesting.  My prediction on politics is it's going to be a three-way race.  If Trump gets the nomination, there will be establishment Republican, who offers an alternative to voters.  if Trump doesn't get the nomination, somebody else, Trump, maybe somebody else runs instead to show how mad they are at the establishment.  WALLACE:  Basically you're saying there would be two Republican/conservative.  PAGE:  The party is too split to hold it together.  WALLACE:  Is that a guarantee that Hillary --PAGE:  Likely.  WALLACE:  Really?PAGE: That's not actually part of my prediction.  But yeah.WALLACE:  That's a new prediction.  Michael, politics.NEEDHAM:  Nikki Haley has been a phenomenal governor of South Carolina.  She's given the economy room to flourish, she's shown grace in leadership in crisis in South Carolina.  She also understands the dynamic of the grassroots versus the establishment.  When she ran for governor, she was opposed by a sitting congressman, a lieutenant governor and attorney general.  Nikki Haley is the best qualified and she will be the Republican nominee for vice president.  WALLACE:  South Carolina is a pretty safe Republican state, why not go for Ohio or Florida or something like that?  NEEDHAM:  They need somebody who can show they understand this divide, between the grassroots and the establishment, somebody who's been a proven executive leadership, somebody who's shown the new face of the South and the Republican Party.  Nikki Haley is that person.  WALLACE:  And a woman?  NEEDHAM:  And a woman.  WALLACE:  Kirsten.POWERS:  I'll take Susan's one step further, and say sanity will take hold in the Republican Party and Trump will not get the nomination, and he will run as a third party candidate, claiming that he's been mistreated by the Republican Party.WALLACE:  And again, that would mean Hillary Clinton would win, according to this?  POWERS:  Theoretically, yes.  WALLACE:  And what about the possibility of a Democratic third or fourth-party candidacy like Jim Webb?  POWERS:  If it happens, it won't impact the race in any way.  WALLACE:  Okay.  Sorry, Mr. Webb.  Economy, Laura?  INGRAHAM:  I think once again, we'll see median income in the United States not peak since its 1999 levels.  I think once again on the economy, we'll see a trade deficit with China that is exceeding $300 billion as it has for the last many number of years.  I don't think we'll see much of a change at all despite lots of rosy predictions about America's economic return.  The middle class still in my mind rules this election.  What's happened to them, people from all walks of life, all backgrounds, I think it's going to dominate both with Hillary and with the Republican nominee.  WALLACE:  Susan?  PAGE:  So if a three-way race is good news for Hillary, this would be very bad news for Hillary, and that is a recession in 2016.  Our recovery already, while it hasn't felt like much of a recovery for a lot of Americans, is what economists call mature, third longest recovery since World War II.  Possible we'll see a downturn, and that would be devastating for the candidate of the party that now holds the White House, and that would be the Democrats.  WALLACE:  So you giveth in the last and you taketh away in this one.  Michael, are you equally bearish on the economy?  NEEDHAM:  I am.  I think it is also going to be a terrible year for America's fraudulent monetary policy.  You just saw the Fed raise interest rates.  They say they're going to raise the interest rates four times by a quarter of a point in 2016.  What the opiate of ultra-low interest rates has done for the last couple of years is it's pushed forward consumer spending, it's delayed business failure.  Both of those things are going to reverse.  I think it's quite likely you have a recession in order to preserve the chance of a Hillary presidency, to preserve the facade of Keynesian monetary policy working, you'll have the Fed back off of those monetary policies, those interest rates.  The Federal Reserve rate will more likely be closer to zero than their target of 1.375 percent.WALLACE:  Kirsten, give us some good news?  POWERS:  I can give you some good news, yes.  We're on track, the economy is on track to reach full employment in 2016, which would be the point at which everybody who wants to be working would be working.  WALLACE:  And what would that be as a number?  POWERS:  5 percent unemployment rate and a 9 percent underemployment rate.  WALLACE:  What are they missing that you see?  POWERS:  I don't know.  (CROSSTALK)POWERS:  But this is generally agreed among most economists, and this is something that hasn't happened in a decade, so it's actually a very key marker in terms of the strength of the economy.WALLACE:  And you think the recovery continues through 2016?  POWERS:  I think (INAUDIBLE) one prediction, really?  I have to do the whole economy?  I feel very sure about this, about the full employment.  We have to see the other issues in the economy, but I think the economy is pretty -- is fundamentally turning around.  WALLACE:  Okay.  Sports, Laura?  INGRAHAM:  Alabama will win the national championship on January 11 in Phoenix.  It is going to be a great night in sports.  I'm from Connecticut.  UConn women's basketball will once again win the NCAA women's championship.  WALLACE:  I have to say once again, because they have won it three years in a row and ten out of the last 20.  So I am not sure I can give you high marks.INGRAHAM:  I don't care.  I'm from Connecticut.  My mother was a Bear Bryant fan, Alabama is going to win the national championship, but I have to stick with my UConn Huskies.  WALLACE:  UConn women.  Susan.PAGE:  So if a recession is bad for Hillary Clinton, here is a sporting event that would be good for Hillary Clinton--(CROSSTALK)PAGE:  -- which is the Chicago Cubs, the first time in 107 years wins the World Series.  She's been a fan of the Cubs since she was a child.  This would happen just days before the election.  WALLACE:  I have to say I somewhat share Michael's skepticism on this.  Because I think when she moved to New York, suddenly she was a Mets or a Yankees fan.  NEEDHAM:  Exactly.  PAGE:  But she never gave up being a Cubs fan.  As she will tell you I'm sure when they win the World Series.WALLACE:  Michael.NEEDHAM:  The Cubs should stick to a more realistic goal like winning a playoff game versus the Mets.  There's not a single player who deserves the World Series ring more than David Wright.  Michael Conforto is going to emerge as a force from both sides of the plate.  The Mets pitching staff is phenomenal.  Noah Syndergaard with his 95-mile-an-hour fastball is going to capture the hearts of New Yorkers.  The New York Mets will win the 2016 World Series.WALLACE:  For those of you who don't live in New York, those are all Mets players whom you haven't heard of before.  I always enjoy this, because Kirsten doesn't know and doesn't care about sports, and we always make her come up with one.  Go ahead.POWERS:  If you have any issues with this, you can take it up with Steve Hayes, because he told me this.  The Washington Capitals will win the Stanley Cup.  WALLACE:  Can you name two players on the Capitols?  POWERS:  No.  You're not allowed follow-up questions.  WALLACE:  Can you name one player on the Capitols?  POWERS:  Call Steve.  WALLACE:  What?  POWERS:  Call Steve.  WALLACE:  Oh, call Steve?  I thought it was a Russian name.  (LAUGHTER)WALLACE:  Entertainment.  Laura.INGRAHAM:  Hamilton is going to dominate the Tony Awards, it's going to continue to be the most talked about play on Broadway in probably a couple of decades, and everyone should go out and see it.  WALLACE:  I have to tell you, as somebody who was lucky enough to go see it, it is fabulous.  If you -- to go to a musical and hear them singing about writing the Federalist Papers, it's pretty darn special.  Susan.PAGE:  Hamilton was incredible.  Here is what -- the film that's going to get nominated and I hope win best picture in the Oscars and that's ""Spotlight.""  It is the best movie I've ever seen about how reporters actually do their jobs, why it matters, the difference it can make, in holding the powerful to account, when you have a community newspaper, a local newspaper in this case, ""The Boston Globe,"" doing the job that journalists are supposed to do.  WALLACE:  This was ""The Boston Globe"" basically finding out and uncovering what the Roman archdiocese had done to protect priests who abused children.  PAGE:  And led to revelations across the globe of some more scandals.  WALLACE:  Michael.  NEEDHAM:  Hollywood's big blockbuster of the spring is ""Batman Versus Superman,"" and the premise is that Batman goes from Gotham to Metropolis, as a check on the ultimate power of the caped crusader.WALLACE:  How do you know this?  NEEDHAM:  I read it on Wikipedia.  The only catch is that it's laughable to think that Superman is going to be intimidated by Ben Affleck.  Especially coming off of the Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale ""Batman.""  It will be fundamentally unserious.  Ben Affleck will go down as Hollywood's worst Batman.  WALLACE:  OK. Kirsten.  POWERS:  A movie called ""13 Hours"" by Michael Bay is coming out.  It's about the Benghazi attack on 9/11.  And it's a terrific movie, but it's also very fair, it's very evenhanded, and I think a pretty true telling to what happened.  WALLACE:  This is about the CIA operatives at the annex, who were prevented or delayed in getting to the consulate?  POWERS:  Exactly.  I think it's not overly political.  It takes a pretty light touch.  That said, because I think it pretty accurately portrays things, it's going to become the recipient of a smear campaign by people on the left (INAUDIBLE).WALLACE:  And just before Iowa and New Hampshire, coming up this month.All right, panel, we have to step aside again.  But when we come back, we'll get one final prediction from each of you, for 2016.  And there are some surprises.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Well, that is pretty.  A look outside the Beltway, at snow-covered Woodbury County, Iowa, north of Sioux City, just 29 days before the first in the nation voting starts there.  And our crack research team has found out that the tree is a redwood, and it's actually the mascot of the Stanford band, so you can all go on with your day.All right, panel.  One final prediction for 2016, this time you get to choose the topic.  Laura, you start.  INGRAHAM:  I think the question is whether the establishment Republicans can hold on for another presidential term in this presidential election cycle, or whether the country and the party is going to move in a more populist, more nationalist economic direction.  That is the fundamental divide.  I think it's been papered over to some extent in recent elections, but that's where we are right now in the Republican Party.  You also see it happening across Europe.  Different extents, different types of movements, but there's a sense that things just aren't all that fair, and that a lot of the people in the middle or lower working poor just can't get ahead, even though in the global economy, a lot of people can get really rich.WALLACE:  And very briefly, does the party split apart over this issue?  INGRAHAM:  I don't -- I don't know.  I don't know how to predict that.  Btu I think now the power -- the money is with the establishment, as usual, and the power is with the people.  WALLACE:  Susan?  PAGE:  You know, we would expect this to be a year in which nothing gets done in Washington, because for one thing generally nothing gets down in Washington, and also we have a presidential election going on, but I think it's possible that we'll have a situation that's kind of an odd bedfellows arrangement between a lame-duck president, the reluctant new speaker, to actually get some things done on the Pacific trade deal, maybe on a tax bill?  WALLACE:  Obama and Paul Ryan?  PAGE:  Obama and Paul Ryan, especially if the presidential race looks like it's a blowout.  If it's a three-way race, with the kind of division we talked about earlier, it could be like 1996.  You remember the Republicans in Congress worked with the Democratic president in order to get things done, because they had given up on their presidential candidate.  WALLACE:  Michael.NEEDHAM:  That sounds like a recipe for a Hillary Clinton presidency, but I actually think what you'll see is a Republican Party that unifies around a very much pro-free enterprise, anti-Washington, D.C. populist message.  It will unify the party and it will actually win at the ballot box.  A majority of Americans will deliver a conservative mandate, and what that will force is the cronies at the Chamber of Commerce and elsewhere here in Washington, D.C., to choose whether they want to join an optimistic free enterprise party, or whether they want to go to the Democrats and play the pandering politics--  WALLACE:  Very briefly, flip it around, if the establishment wins, does your wing of the party bolt?NEEDHAM:  I think that if the establishment wins, then we'll have a continued debate about whether this should be a party that just plays the kind of cronyism politics that the Democrats are doing a perfectly capable job of, or whether we become a free enterprise party.WALLACE:  Kirsten.  POWERS:  I think that what was once referred to as Bill Clinton's bimbo eruptions, which now sounds like something that (INAUDIBLE) say today, are going to become problems for Hillary during the campaign.  The conventional wisdom says this has all been hashed out, and nobody cares about it anymore, but I think if we look at the Bill Cosby situation, we can see the country has definitely changed in terms of how we look at these issues, and these are serious allegations, and her role in them at well.  WALLACE:  All right, thank you, all, panel.  I predict it is going to be a great 2016 in a Republican contest that's already broken all the rules, and then a fascinating and important general election.  We hope you will stick with us every step of the way.  And a quick program note: As the countdown to Iowa continues next week, I'll sit down with the Republican front-runner, Donald Trump.And that's it for today.  Have a great week, and we'll see you next ""Fox News Sunday.""Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
