There's juicy stuff in there and I'm sure many will dive right in. All in the name of transparency, right?But as this happens the medical files of our prized U.S. Olympic athletes were posted online by Russian hackers. Hooray about that too! Those kids had it coming! After all, if one leak's so awesome, why can't the other be?Are some hacks heroic and others evil? What does it say, when you embrace one hack because it hurts someone, but not another? Doesn't that make you a hack, too?Ever the hero, Julian Assange has released some of his medical records, as if to say, ""If I'm fine with exposing my personal life, why shouldn't you?"" Of course, these records were released by him, so he controlled the flow of info. That's no hack. Instead, Julian, why not let your worst enemy have at the privileged info between you and your lawyer on the rape charge? That's brave.It's so inspiring to see conservatives lauding a man who jeopardized our security, a man such righties previously wanted in jail. But when leaks hurt the other side, all bets -- and principles -- are off. It's selfish, deliberate moral blindness that comes with team sport politics.So drool with glee over scoop after scoop of exposed linen, feeding that proverbial crocodile, hoping it will eat you last. And when it does, I'll bring the condiments.Greg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET).

Latest ABC News tracking poll has Trump up by one. Rasmussen has the race tied. Investors' business daily has Hillary Clinton up by one. The Real Clear Politics average, Clinton by 2.2 percent, which is a virtual tie.It all comes down to electoral votes and we will analyze those in just a few moments. No matter who wins the presidency, Americans will be uneasy. Let's take Hillary Clinton first. Mrs. Clinton has devoted herself to public service in three decades but has not really achieved anything outstanding. Her major accomplishment was helping the state and city of New York after the 9/11 attack. As senator here she did a very good job getting resources in to a devastated area. As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton actively participated in President Obama's failed attempt to place the U.S.A. in a subordinate position overseas.As we all know, Mr. Obama did not want to lead, rather he hesitated in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, in confronting Russia. That policy is turning out to be disastrous and Hillary Clinton was his secretary of state for much of the retreat. That is not a partisan analysis. That is a fact. All you have to do is look at what is happening in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Europe, South China Sea, Iran, and the Persian Gulf not to mention North Korea. Foreign policy under Barack Obama has been a chaotic failure. Our enemies do not, do not fear us.If Hillary Clinton is elected president, there is really no reason for optimism. She supported the failure of ObamaCare. She has veered sharply left in her social beliefs. Now, she doesn't even oppose partial birth abortion on the day a baby would be born. As for the economy, Mrs. Clinton is a tax and spend liberal. And that policy has not stimulated growth for eight long years in this country. Now, on the other side there is Donald Trump. Completely untested in geo politics. Mr. Trump has made big promises that he will return prosperity to the U.S.A. and regain a leadership role for America and the world. That will not be easy.And Mr. Trump has no track record, no achievements to bolster his rhetoric. Instead he has a checkered business record. Although, to be fair, he has overcome big setbacks to build a very powerful business brand. Mr. Trump is running as an outsider who promises to clean up Washington and that message alone has a tremendous appeal. As everyone knows, his personal life as entertainer has been controversial. He is a blunt speaker who sometimes does not think before he makes public statements and that has hurt him with minority Americans and those who fear confrontation.If Mr. Trump is elected president, he will take office with the least amount of political experience of any commander-in-chief in history. So voters, you guys are faced with more negatives than positives in this election. Hillary Clinton is portrayed as a dishonest person who has had controversy after controversy. Donald Trump is portrayed as an immature rogue who has had controversy after controversy. That's the choice America faces one week from today. In the end, it should come down to your own belief system and which candidate better reflects that. It's personal.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

And how it turns out will affect millions around the country, perhaps even the world. There is no going back after this.The seventh game of the World Series, the Indians versus the Cubs. Or as I prefer to call it, the thing that preempts ""Empire.""What's great about game seven? You can have Trump supporters and Hillary fans on the same side and they won't kill each other. You can focus on something emotionally gratifying, even when it's just grown men in pajamas, running around a square made of dirt and turf and no word of politics.The most important thing about the series is how different it is from that world. The World Series is about real people, real emotion. But a large faction of election talk isn't from real people at all but bots: fake people created this propaganda. Did you know that Twitter bots, both pro-Trump and pro-Clinton, make up a lot of your Twitter traffic? So chances are, much of the stuff that upsets you has no pulse.Also absent in the game: The phony political showboating of the attention-seeking athlete. Unlike the NFL, no one takes a knee in baseball, which could be why we keep watching.So thank goodness for baseball. It may be too long, too slow, too boring, but unlike the world beyond the field, it's still too real.Greg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET).
