This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: These campus protests now spilling on to the campaign trail. And New Jersey governor, 2016 GOP candidate Chris Christie is not afraid to place, at least some of the blame, on President ObamaGovernor Chris Christie goes ON THE RECORD from Iowa. Good evening, governor.GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good evening, Greta. How are you tonight?VAN SUSTEREN: I'm very well. So, governor, all these -- not all these, but several campuses have protests and I at least read one article which you in part ties this to President Obama. Do you tie these protests to him?CHRISTIE: Well, what I said, Greta, and I want to be very clear about it is I think the president has allowed a sense of lawlessness and divisiveness to settle in over our country.And he has not enforced the law in a way that's been both fair and just enough perceived that way. And when people make that determination, they tend to begin to start to take matters into their own hands.And so I think that the president bears responsibility, not only for that, but for the missed opportunity to bring us together in a much greater way in this country. Promise that he showed during the 2008 campaign, but seven years later, he has totally wasted.VAN SUSTEREN: In terms of a sense of lawlessness, can you be specific? What has he done that projects that?CHRISTIE: Not enforcing the law. He hasn't backed up law enforcement, Greta, in any kind of specific way. He has not done the things that a president needs to do to make law enforcement feel as if the president of the United States has their back. He does not enforce immigration law that allow sanctuary cities to sprout up throughout our country, over 200 sanctuary cities now in America.The president does not enforce the drug laws in this country by allowing states like Colorado, Washington and others to have legalized recreational marijuana. This is a president who decides to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce, which ones he doesn't. He signs illegally executive orders that now are being stopped by the federal courts. This is a lawless presidency.He picks and chooses which laws he wants to enforce like he is a dictator. When that kind of thing happens, people in the country begin to think that the legal system, the justice system is not something that is available to them and they begin to take matters into their own hands.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. If you will become president, Chris Christie, what would you do to change this? I mean, how would you sort of restore some of the things that you say that the president has -- at least some of the promises in 2008 to unite that have not happened?CHRISTIE: Well, first off, Greta, I would rescind all of the illegal executive orders that the president has put in place. I would put in place an attorney general who understood that his job every day was to make sure justice was done in this country without regard to bias, prejudice, or politics.And that has not happened in this administration. And I would make sure that folks understood that the law was to be followed in this country. And that would, I think, provide assurance to a great number of people in this country who right now believe that you only have to follow the laws you like.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. We had a discussion last week on this show about the fact that $43 million was spent on a gas station in Afghanistan that should have cost $500,000.There is so much waste in this government. I don't know where to start, there is so much of it. But that's a good place to start.If you were the president, and from your background as being a U.S. attorney, would you at least convene a grand jury to see where this money is going and who is taking it -- going from $500,000 to 43 million?Would you think that would warrant at least a grand jury investigation?CHRISTIE: Yes, I would tell my attorney general they have to look at all of these areas of not just waste, but this is fraud, Greta. There is no doubt about it in my mind about that.And I think if an appropriate grand jury were convened, they would find fraud and they would find those responsible and those who profited from it. You know when I was U.S. attorney that we prosecuted many American companies who were engaged in ripping off their shareholders, ripping off the American public.I would have an attorney general who took a very serious look at that. And, by the way, I would tell every cabinet secretary that in the first year, if you couldn't find one penny of waste out of every dollar that we send you to return that money to the Treasury, you wouldn't be the cabinet secretary for year two.VAN SUSTEREN: Why do you think this this has been going on. It's not just this president, but it's been forever. At least as long as I can remember in Washington. There's so much government waste and nobody bothers to convene a grand jury to find out where it's going because this is taking our tax payer money. If Haiti were doing it, or if Sudan were doing it, or some other country, we would all be saying that those governments are corrupt.CHRISTIE: Well, the fact is because people have not seen in quite a long time an aggressive law enforcer as president of the United States. Someone who has a background in being a prosecutor, who understands what it takes to be able to put right back into our lives every day and also someone who understands the tools that are available to prosecutors and demands that they use them.Those are the kind of things that I have done in my career. And it's what I would bring to the oval office when i become president.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. You are in Iowa. So tell me what question do you get asked the most today in Iowa. What's on top of their minds at least today in Iowa?CHRISTIE: On top of the minds today in Iowa is terrorism. People are very concerned. Really concerned about this president and the way he is conducting the war on terror. They are concerned about ISIS. They are concerned about Syria.Folks here in Iowa are really worried. They are worried that America is essentially being walked on around the world. And that it is going to come back to pay real, real costs inside this country and our homeland security.So folks in Iowa, they are very concerned about terrorism and homeland security and what they know in talking to me is that I'm the only person that has prosecuted terrorists, convicted them and sent them to jail. And I will bring the same attitude in fighting terrorism to the Oval Office.VAN SUSTEREN: You got rave reviews the other night at the debate. Did it feel good after you finished that debate?CHRISTIE: I felt great after I finished the debate, Greta. And I felt great for two reasons. First, because people understood exactly where I stood on the issues. There was no calls afterwards that I was unclear or contradictory in anything that I said before.And, secondly, because I kept the fight focused where it needs to be focused, which is on Hillary Rodham Clinton. The fact is that the American people have to know the liberal, socialist agenda that she is now pursuing as she moves further and further left in her pursuit of the Democratic nomination.I'm the person, the best person who has been tested and mature enough to stand on that stage next September and prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton. I'm ready to do that and I wanted to make sure everybody at that debate understood I was ready to do it.VAN SUSTEREN: Governor, nice to see you. I hope you will come back and enjoy Iowa, sir.CHRISTIE: You bet I will. Thanks for having me on, Greta. And Iowa is always a lot of fun."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY: When the executive branch tries to assume the legislative powers, that's a form of tyranny.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president can't -- he's not going to tell the American people that he's going to wait for Congress.JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He's an American citizen, and it stands to reason that he might be frustrated with Congress, since most American citizens are.BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're not going to wait. I've got a pen and I've got a phone, and that's all I need.RUSH LIMBAUGH, CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST: Obama's definition of unity is eliminating opposition, not agreeing with them and peacefully co-existing with them. It's eliminating them.CARNEY: He's going to use his pen and his phone.BRIT HUME, FOX CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: There's not a lot he can do. That's why you hear him talking about pens and telephones, because he can't get anything through Congress.CARNEY: The president should absolutely use the powers available to him and the unique authority that the office provides.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Use the American presidency in two areas, his pen, which is the executive orders, also the phone. What he can do is he can pick up the phone, bring together American citizens.PAUL: He says, oh, well, it's hard to get Congress to do anything. Yeah, welcome to the real world.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: Change, well, not exactly change. It's another big broken promise from President Obama. The president promising to change Washington when he moved into the White House, but after failing at that, the president is now trying to bypass the legislative branch of government and just sign executive orders to get what he wants. Is that the kind of change President Obama campaigned on?Charles Krauthammer joins us. Nice to see you, Charles.Charles, what's this business about he's going to change Washington and all this gridlock business?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR & AUTHOR: He says he's going to eliminate Article I of the Constitution that says that legislation comes from Congress. This is how they do it in Venezuela, Cuba, and other places. He waives the pen, he shows it on Twitter and he says, ""I will rule from the pen.""What makes it sort of pathetic is that it sounds like a tough threat and it is unconstitutional. It's not how you ought to be the President of the United States. But in the end, there's very little he can do.What's interesting is he said the same thing in 2011. This was a speech he gave in Nevada. It was announced by the White House as the ""we can't wait"" tour. And it was one statement after another, I'm not going to wait for Congress to act, I will do X, Y and Z. In the end, it didn't work, because in the end, the only things a president can do with a pen, executive orders, are fairly limited. With one exception, that's EPA, and using the EPA to shut down entire industries. That's power.VAN SUSTEREN: A couple of things from this memo that's gotten out. ""The Washington Post"" reported on it. When he said he's not going to go to Congress, but he's going to go and use his pen. That, to me, when you campaign on ""I'm going to change Washington,"" that means I give up. That's not what you expect a leader to do. You expect a leader to carry out those promises. That's the first thing. The second thing is that so many Democrats are making cracks at Governor Christie for being a bully. Now, we have a bully who says he's going to use his pen and bypass Congress. It's interesting, on the one hand, they hate the attitude Governor Christie has when he says he going to do things, but when the president does it, it's OK.KRAUTHAMMER: The reason he gave up was because he failed. He was unable to do what he thought he could do. And he couldn't even do what other presidents have done, which he wanted to transcend and to make, do a more efficient, harmonious, no red state, no blue states America. He didn't do any of that. But he can't even do what normal presidents have done, what Clinton did, what Reagan did, which is to work with the other side.VAN SUSTEREN: I think Clinton actually liked members of Congress, even the ones he didn't agree with.KRAUTHAMMER: He liked politics.VAN SUSTEREN: He liked politics.KRAUTHAMMER: Yeah.VAN SUSTEREN: I don't think that President Obama wants to spend any time with any politician of any party. He played golf with John Boehner, twice maybe.KRAUTHAMMER: You get the impression he chose the wrong field.(LAUGHTER)VAN SUSTEREN: Or he wanted to run to the White House so he wouldn't have to be around colleagues.KRAUTHAMMER: But he doesn't like what the presidency requires, which is, A, some understanding and some respect for the other side. Reagan and Tip O'Neill worked out the most important piece of economic legislation, tax reform, and they were polar opposites ideologically. Obama has tax reform in his reach. There are Republicans who want to do -- it would change the economy. It would be a tremendous help to economic expansion and fairness because it would take away the loophole that the rich has. He hasn't touched it in five years.VAN SUSTEREN: And it would be so fun to change the tax code to make it fair and get rid of the loopholes, for the extra special.Anyway, I'm taking the last word on that, Charles.KRAUTHAMMER: You got it."
