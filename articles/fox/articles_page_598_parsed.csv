This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POPE FRANCIS (via translator): A person who thinks only about building walls wherever they may be and not of building bridges is not Christian. This is not the gospel.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If and when the Vatican is attacked by is, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president. For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.BILL DONOHUE, CATHOLIC LEAGUE PRESIDENT: There is nothing that either this Pope or any other Pope has ever said, nor will you find it in the Catholic catechism, anything where the Catholic Church says a nation does not have a right to defend its own borders. The Catholic Church is solidly in favor of that. What he's simply saying is that's not the end of the conversation.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, it was a bit surreal on the campaign trail, the Pope, Donald Trump talking about exactly what was said. We read all the statement earlier in the show.We do want to bring on some new Fox polls. First of all, the national poll has Donald Trump with a big lead, continuing lead at 36 percent over Ted Cruz, 19. There you see Rubio at 15. Then if you look at the presidential preference, this is versus Hillary Clinton -- obviously it could be Bernie Sanders -- but there you see Rubio over Clinton 48-44, Kasich, Cruz, Trump losing to Clinton in this poll 47 to 42.This week obviously the focus on South Carolina. The overall South Carolina picture, again, Donald Trump with a big lead and Cruz in second, Rubio in third. And then this question, who would you never support? And that has changed dramatically from December. Trump up in that poll as well, 39 percent say they would support him. Bush second in a state that lines up for Bush a lot of people said, 21 percent saying they would never vote for him.Let's bring in our panel, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial analyst, Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Judge, first the Pope and Donald Trump. Reading the whole back and forth, you get a different context than perhaps the coverage today.JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: You do. And I commend you for reading the full statements of each of them. They are far less incendiary and even more rational when you read the entire statements.I say what I am about to say as a practicing traditionalist Roman Catholic. Before Vatican II you didn't have to say ""traditionalist,"" and now you do. The Pope likes to opine in areas outside his expertise, as far away from Catholicism as economics, as the environment, and now American domestic politics. I think he stay out of it. I happen to disagree with Donald Trump on the law. I disagree with Donald Trump on mass deportations. The Pope is entitled to a political opinion. But when the Pope gives a political opinion, there's imprimatur, no pun intended, on what he says. He didn't become the Pope to lead Catholics to vote for or against an American politician.BAIER: And he says as much. I'm not going to get involved, advise to vote for or not to vote, not going to get involved in that. But he was interpreted in a way, and Donald Trump interpreted him in a way in his response.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: And that was, to me, what really leapt out today. Donald Trump took this as a great opportunity to get into a match with the Pope who is very unpopular with conservatives and evangelicals, maybe in South Carolina.The Pope, every one of those Republican candidates wants to build a wall. He wasn't necessarily talking about Donald Trump, but Donald Trump decided to escalate it, as he does. He got an opening and he took it. We were not talking about Nikki Haley endorsing Rubio. We were talking about the Pope and Donald Trump.BAIER: Political, Mara, does that help him?LIASSON: I think it could. I don't think it hurts him. I don't think it hurts him at all. The Pope is unpopular with conservatives, this Pope is. And Donald Trump is not going for the big Catholic vote in South Carolina. He is going for an evangelical vote.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Initially when I heard about it I thought Trump would retort with a quote from Two Corinthians. Actually that's a cheap shot but I'll take one.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: I like the other one. The two Corinthians walk into a bar.(LAUGHTER)KRAUTHAMMER: The other thing is this. Trump did sort of jump the shark on this and he reached for it. And you have got to wonder, after everybody is taking him on, now he takes on the Pope, who is left? It's the big guy upstairs.Look, the reason I take this lightly is because I don't think it amounts to anything. What the pope said was a general statement that any religious leader could say. If you only talk about walls and not bridges, that's not good. He does this in a general way. Trump takes it as an attack on him, cleverly, I think. This is in a state, South Carolina, that is not that friendly to papists, and the Pope is a papist, apparently. So this is a good play. But it is meaningless. It gives him a day in the news, which is what he does brilliantly day after day, and it's not going to hurt him at all.NAPOLITANO: He took Nikki Haley supporting Marco Rubio completely off the front page.BAIER: A lot of talk about the negative ads, the negative sense in South Carolina. Here's Marco Rubio today on a photo that emerged from the Cruz campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is not real. The picture is fake. It is a Photoshop of someone else shaking hands. And it appears it isn't even Barack Obama either. So I think this is now a disturbing pattern, guys. Every day they're making things up. In this case they literally made up a picture.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: And here's the side by side look at the pictures. There you see the Rubio/Obama trade pact and the picture that they apparently got it off of. Does this sink in? Obviously, Rubio is saying that Ted Cruz is a liar again and again and again.LIASSON: This is his message. Ted Cruz is a liar. Ted Cruz did dirty tricks in Iowa. He's now doing to me. Boy, against the standards of South Carolina, bare knuckle politics, this is peanuts. This is nothing. I think this is also completely inconsequential. We want to see some real South Carolina dirty tricks. We haven't seen any this year. Sometimes you don't hear about them.BAIER: We're heading there tonight, so we'll tell you what happens tomorrow one day before the primary. Judge, your thoughts?NAPOLITANO: I think it does show a pattern. I happen to like Ted Cruz. I know him very well. But maybe he doesn't have control over his campaign or maybe he's looking the other way or maybe he thinks that this stuff is all part of the game. But I think it does show a pattern and it is disturbing. That is no more Marco Rubio and Barack Obama than it is you and me.BAIER: I will say that Marco Rubio has not been challenged specifically on some of the things that he says Ted Cruz is lying about. What he said on Univision in Spanish. If you look at the transcript of that, he actually said what Ted Cruz said.KRAUTHAMMER: This is a campaign in which every major candidate is getting away with saying stuff not just that isn't so, that is never investigated. I mean, the list of accusations and charges is long. It reminds me -- you talk about how dirty the politics are in the south. It reminds of a story, probably apocryphal, of a guy who accused his opponent of being in a theater of being a thespian, and that really resonates.(LAUGHTER)NAPOLITANO: What was the outcome of that allegation? Nobody took out a dictionary?Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" November 15, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: You know what we lose sight of, though, is that if you had a race based on who had the most votes, period, they would be running a different race. So, there's no way to say that this is the result you would get in a popular vote race.Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff, great historian of all things politics as well, with us right now.Karl, Donald Trump does raise a good point, that if he wanted to target and run the kind of race that would have garnered the most votes, then sort of you sit in the most populous areas and you run with it. Don't you?KARL ROVE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Yes.Well, first of all, he is the fifth American president. John Quincy Adams is the first. He was missing from that list.But, yes, look, if this were a -- there would be two results if this were a popular vote majority country. We would no longer -- we wouldn't be in Iowa. People would be campaigning in the big -- Republicans would go to Tarrant County, Texas, Fort Worth, and the suburbs of Houston, and Orange County, California. Democrats would go to San Francisco and New York.And a big part of the country would be overlooked. But here's an even more pernicious problem. We would then have a multiplicity of parties, because if it is first -- if it is the popular vote, we have 14 presidents who have been elected with plurality of the vote. That is to say, they didn't get 50 percent.If we were to go popular vote only, how long would it be before we would have runoffs? Bill Clinton was elected twice, never got 50 percent of the vote. Woodrow Wilson elected twice, never got 50 percent of the vote.  Abraham Lincoln got elected with 40-some-odd percent of the vote, less than Michael Dukakis got in being defeated in 1988.So, the two-party system, which has given the American democracy a stability and a continuity that makes us the longest living democracy in the world, would be sorely undermined by a move away from the Electoral College.CAVUTO: Though I wonder why the measure, coming in, as it does, in a week we have had all these protests, I don't think that's just coincidental, obviously, given these protests and largely by high schoolers in the latest round.You have to wonder, who is putting whom up to what and to what end? To delegitimize Donald Trump before he even takes office?ROVE: Yes, absolutely.This happened in 2000. I was on a program last night in Houston with Paul Begala, who to this day doesn't believe that George W. Bush was a legitimately elected president of the United States. I called him a dead- ender on ""Fox News Sunday,"" which amused Chris Wallace.But, yes, there was a concerted effort after the 2000 election to say Bush's loss in the popular vote caused him to be an illegitimate president.  And it has happened virtually every instance. This was the argument raised against Rutherford B. Hayes and Benjamin Harrison in the 1870s and 1880s.CAVUTO: When I'm looking at high schoolers, though, Karl, if you want to skip class, that's one thing and all, but obviously they're being encouraged. Go ahead, leave class, leave the school, go out there, chant, make your views known, if it is about sanctuary cities, it's about protecting illegals, whatever. We're not going to stop you.But I'm thinking they're going one step further. This is all being choreographed.ROVE: Yes. Well, it may be at a local level, because -- but we may or may not ever know who is behind it.But look at those signs. Talk about illiteracy. Silence equals violence?  No, no, no, violence equals violence. You're entitled to your opinion, but you're right. Maybe this is a -- a better use of their time would be to have an organized discussion in which all viewpoints are represented in their school if they want to talk about this topic, rather than just simply being allowed to flow out into the streets and show up in front of Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C., and shout a lot of ugly slogans and wave around a bunch of stupid signs.CAVUTO: I just wonder, if it was reversed, Karl -- I know you have I have chatted about this -- if it was Hillary Clinton won the election and a lot of angry Trump voters, they would have been anarchists. Reading the press as I have on these kids and others, they're exercising free speech.ROVE: Sure.Yes, look, one would be a group of domestic terrorists and the other are idealistic young people out exercising their free speech rights, which in a way they are. But you're right. Children from high schools being allowed to go out and take a day off from school, this is not a snow day.And my suspicion is that D.C. school authorities are not going to be too emphatic about making sure that they make up these days.CAVUTO: But, you know, I'm wondering what the fallout is from all of this.  If it gets all of the media attention and it gets -- well, we're covering it now. It takes the attention off what a president-elect Trump is trying to do.You still have to make note of it, though, because to me it just looks like a lot of sore losers.ROVE: Yes, look, we have to cover it. It's a news story. People are out in the streets and so forth.But you know what it means with regard to the incoming president? Zero.  We had in 2001 at the inauguration threats of demonstrators who wanted to break up the inaugural parade and storm the inaugural ceremony on Capitol Hill, and lots of press attention, lots of people screaming.I remember riding down Pennsylvania Avenue and having protesters screaming and yelling. But you know what? Didn't stop President George W. Bush from being president.These kind of things are interesting news, but they're the background noise and they're not going to stop Donald Trump from taking office on January 20. He is 100 percent the president of the United States, just as the four people who were elected before him under our constitutionally sanctioned system with a minority of the popular vote and an Electoral College majority have been.CAVUTO: And to give President Obama due credit and Hillary Clinton, they were both stressing just that. They were duly elected, and fair and square he won.But in the meantime, we have Harry Reid on the floor of the Senate. I don't even know what he's saying. I know that he says the most outlandish stuff.And I understand, Karl, that you could say any outlandish thing you want on the Senate floor and not be held accountable for it.ROVE: Well, among the many things Harry Reid has said on the floor is that Mitt Romney paid no income taxes.CAVUTO: I remember that well.ROVE: Look, Harry -- one of the best things about this election is, this is the last time we will see Harry Reid in public office.He has proven himself to be a despicable human being in his personal conduct in the political arena. Republicans should be grateful to him, though, because his stewardship of the Senate leadership, taking in to himself the power to decide what amendments would be offered in bills, ruining the tradition of 200 years that the Senate would be untrampled democracy, open debate, and unlimited amendments, and deciding that he alone was in charge of deciding what amendments would be considered and voted upon, this is what caused Senate Democrats to lose their majority in 2014.He is -- it is a good thing for American democracy that this man is retiring to Searchlight, Nevada. It's not too soon for me. January 4 can't arrive too early for Harry Reid to hit the road and go home.CAVUTO: To that point, he is saying that the Klan, the Ku Klux Klan, is celebrating this election. Where does responsibility end here?ROVE: He served for many years in close concert with Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who was a Ku Klux Klan member, even while he had been in his early days in the Congress.So, Harry Reid is a demagogue. We are spending way -- we spend too much time on those high school students. I would rather, though, go back and talk about them than to talk about this human being. This is a man -- I was sitting in the White House, and the Democrats were blocking five appellate nominees to the United States Courts of Appeals.And Harry Reid called me and said, you know what, every one of these five people is unfit for office, morally unfit for office, but we will give you two of them. You withdraw three names, and we will approve two of your names.I said, really, really, Senator, if they're morally unfit, shouldn't you be under a moral obligation not to allow any of them to serve? And said, not only that, but do you know these people?And one of them was Charles Pickering of Mississippi. I said, do you know what he did as a young district attorney in Laurel, Mississippi? He took on the Ku Klux Klan in the middle of the 1960s and got tossed out at the next election. And you're attacking this guy as a racist. This is a man who together with leaders in the black community and a Democratic governor worked together to reconcile the races in Mississippi by bringing people together behind the scenes to talk about their grievances and a way forward.And this is a man you are attacking as a bigot. And I said, every one of the other four nominees are people of exemplary quality and character and you're trashing them and saying they're morally unfit, but you're willing to let us have two of the morally unfit people. This is the kind of guy he is.CAVUTO: I didn't even know that.Karl Rove, thank you very, very much.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
