The Bush administration wants to clamp down on all those malpractice suits.What is the administration up to? Let's ask Health and Human Services, secretary, Tommy Thompson.Secretary, always a pleasure. Thank you for coming.SECRETARY TOMMY THOMPSON, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Neil, as always, a pleasure. Thank you very much for having me on your program.CAVUTO: So this is going after lawyers?THOMPSON: No, it is going after the frivolous lawsuits. It is going to hopefully allow for doctors and hospitals who pay really high malpractice insurance payments, are going to be able to see those premiums be held as sort of a status quo, a stabilized rate, instead of keeping going up. The rates are going up at an alarming rate. And as a result of that, a lot of good doctors are driven out of the practice.They can't make it, and they say, well, what is this use? And they can't practice without it, so they walk away from their practice.CAVUTO: Do you worry, Secretary, with the best of intentions, some doctors begin to get risky, maybe even sloppy, fearing that there is little punishment?THOMPSON: No, absolutely not. Because a lot of states, like my home state of Wisconsin, the president's home state of Texas, California has had a limit on non-economic damages for years. And those states continue to have good health practices, good health care. It is in those states that don't have any limits that really have seen an alarming increase in premiums for liability insurance.Such high premiums that a lot of doctors are forced to either make the decision of not having insurance or getting out of the practice. And that, to me, is just a very, a very terrible decision that some good doctors and good hospitals have to make.CAVUTO: Secretary, you know a lot of people have debated this issue in the past and, invariably, the thing the trial attorneys always hold up is the one doctor who makes a mistake, takes out either the wrong limb or leaves sutures in a patient, those heinous cases that get people's attention, and they say doctors like that, the bad ones, should pay and pay through the nose. And that always wins out. I'm never quite sure why, but that more emotional argument wins out.How are you going to win yours?THOMPSON: Well, I think just by pointing out the common sense facts. That there is a lot of states that have limits, and those states have good quality health care. There are many other ways to ferret out bad doctors and bad practitioners.You have peer review in just about every state. You have your medical associations that review bad practices. You have many different ways to do it. Plus, you still allow for the court system to work.All economic damages will continue to be paid. Loss of time, a loss of wages. And these type of things will be paid immediately in a lawsuit. It is just that it will be a cap on non-economic damages of pain and suffering of $250,000.CAVUTO: Do you worry, Secretary, that let's say John Edwards is the nominee of the Democrats, and of course a trial attorney by fame and gained a great deal of wealth through that.THOMPSON: Right.CAVUTO: He always pits this against you guys are on the side of the big doctors. And he could say, even if he's a big lawyer, the big doctors are more heinous. What do you say?THOMPSON: Well, I say to anybody that will listen -- plus I'm an attorney -- I will say to them that there are some bad practitioners. There are bad lawyers, as there are bad doctors. There are bad TV producers. Any place that you go there are bad and good.And what you have to do is you have to still have the court system set up to take care of that. You have peer reviews set up to do that. And I know the trial lawyers try to say, well, this is just helping out the insurance companies. That is absolutely not the case.Frivolous lawsuits and high insurance premiums are driving good doctors, some good doctors out of practice. Arkansas is one of those states that has a very difficult time of having OBGYN doctors practice in that state because of the high liability insurance. And I would think that those individual expecting mothers would like to have a good doctor taking care of them instead of having high insurance premiums that drive those doctors out of practice.CAVUTO: Secretary, it's almost as bad as saying there are bad TV anchors out there. We don't know where they are, but...THOMPSON: I made very clear I wouldn't say that, Neil, because we know there aren't any such things.CAVUTO: All right. Secretary Tommy Thompson, in Washington, thank you, sir. Appreciate it.THOMPSON: Thank you very much, Neil.Content and Programming Copyright 2004 Fox News Network, Inc. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Tonight, the House Oversight Committee pushing for an investigation into new -- yes, new, and more -- accusations against the IRS. This time, groups who already have tax-exempt status say the IRS targeted them.One of those groups is the Leadership Institute. Its communications director, Abby Alger, joins us. Nice to see you, Abby.ABIGAIL ALGER, THE LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE: Hi, Greta. Thanks for having me.VAN SUSTEREN: First of all, tell me what your organization is.ALGER: So the Leadership Institute has been training conservatives since 1979. We have more than 120,000 graduates of our program. And that's why we were so surprised in June 2011 when the IRS kicked off a 13-month audit into our tax-exempt status that cost us more than $50,000 in legal fees and required more than 23,000 pages of paperwork.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, now, you already had a tax-exempt status. So this was an audit, right? So you were not applying for tax-exempt status, is that correct?ALGER: Absolutely. Our audit was about our existing tax-exempt status, and I'm sure of interest to the viewers, occurred from the Baltimore office instead of the now infamous Cincinnati IRS office.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, whether we like it or not, the IRS audits people all the time. Some of it's very legitimate, these audits. So I'm curious, what makes you think that your audit was unfair or it was targeted because you're conservative?ALGER: Well, there's three things, Greta. The first is the timeline. The audit of us as an existing organization closely parallels the audits of all the new conservative organizations applying for their tax status for the first time.The second is that a new conservative organization, the Hawaii Tea Party, was specifically asked about their relationship to the Leadership Institute and to turn over the training materials that they received from us.The third is the nature of the questions that we received from the IRS. So there's either amazing telepathy occurring across the IRS offices or there's something more going on behind the scenes.VAN SUSTEREN: OK, what were the questions that you thought were inappropriate or made you sort of -- at least made you suspicious this was an inappropriate political targeting?ALGER: So there were a wide range of questions, and they started with the applications for our summer internships and the physical work locations of our interns, ranging to the ways that we advertised for the more than 300 events that we host every year, to sample correspondence between employers and our staff members for Conservativejobs.com, our free job listings Web site.VAN SUSTEREN: Do you know of any other organization, conservative or liberal, got questions that are similar to that? Because if there's sort of the -- if liberal groups were targeted and that these are questions liberal groups get, then it would be less alarming. But if you're singled out, that's a big difference.ALGER: For us, it was the questions, which we haven't heard from another group. But more importantly, that link between us and the Hawaii Tea Party because that shows the link between the Baltimore office, the Cincinnati office, the connection being the Leadership Institute and the timing of the event.VAN SUSTEREN: How did they hook you up with Hawaii? I mean, that's quite a geographical jump.ALGER: So we, just like with other conservative organizations, hosted training events in Hawaii with the Hawaii Tea Party. We do that with more than 100 organizations across the country every single year. But in this case, the question of between the Hawaii Tea Party and between the Leadership Institute and how they drew that line, we'd love to know that. And that's why we support the call for further investigation because right now, the IRS has all the cards.VAN SUSTEREN: Do you intend to push to be part of any of these hearings on Capitol Hill?ALGER: We've certainly been in communication with Hill staff. If you notice, the open letter today from Congressmen Issa and Jordan included a number of citations of one of our vice presidents, who shared a large amount of information relating to our audit.So we certainly intend to share our experience to help others learn from it, and more importantly, to stand up for the hundreds of groups, potentially, around the country that are afraid to come forward about their audits.VAN SUSTEREN: What do you think about the president calling it phony?ALGER: I think it's incredibly interesting. And I would love to see all the cards laid on the table on behalf of the IRS so we can start seeing what happened, when it happened, and more importantly, who knew what when.VAN SUSTEREN: And in terms of the fact that he and rest of his -- he's got Jack Lew, essentially, the Treasury secretary, saying -- and also the press secretary -- does that in any way, you know, pique your interest?ALGER: I think so. And in this case, the question is, for a further investigation, for more information to come out, the only people who potentially benefit are the American taxpayers, who deserve to know what the IRS is doing. The only people who are potentially hurt are the IRS and the Obama administration. So in this case, I'm happy to side with the taxpayers and say that we need to have more information.VAN SUSTEREN: Abby, thank you, and good luck.ALGER: Thank you.VAN SUSTEREN: And it isn't just the Leadership Institute, the president of another conservative group calling its treatment by the IRS pure and simple harassment.Michelle Easton from the Claire Boothe Luce Policy Institute joins us. Nice to see you.MICHELLE EASTON, CLAIRE BOOTHE LUCE POLICY INSTITUTE: Hi, Greta.VAN SUSTEREN: Can you tell me what your organization is?EASTON: We were formed 20 years ago to prepare and promote conservative women leaders.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, now, did you -- you've now had an audit. Did you already have an exemption already and then they initiated -- the IRS initiated an audit against your organization?EASTON: Yes. It was January 2011. I got a call from an agent in Richmond, not Cincinnati, saying they had selected 2008 to audit us. And I had never -- I never thought it was a coincidence, first that they selected 2008, which was the year I took six weeks off, went off the payroll, resigned temporarily to work for Sarah Palin. And I never thought it was a coincidence that they selected 2011, the year so important in the timing of our country's leadership.And then suddenly, a few months ago, all this information came out about the improper actions of the IRS and the pattern of harassment, and I said, I knew it wasn't a coincidence! I'm an attorney, Greta. I'm extraordinarily careful. I have been for 20 years. And an audit of us, as far as I could see, was pure harassment.VAN SUSTEREN: You know, as you know as a lawyer, and even as a taxpayer, you know that the IRS audits lots of people at different times. Was there -- what was it, though, that made you think that it was a political targeting besides the timing? Were there any questions that were unusual or any -- did they ask you anything about any organizations?EASTON: Well, you know, when they tell you they're going to audit you, I said right away, Oh, you know, why? Oh, we can't share that information. Oh, well, did someone file a complaint? Oh, we can't share that information. Was it random? Well, maybe it was random. And they're so secretive about it.Tell us! Tell us who complained, or if it's random, have a public drawing of the random ones so that groups and individuals don't have that stigma that comes with an IRS audit.And once we learned the pattern of this, well, then it seemed like it was time to talk about it because people feel so isolated and so stigmatized when they're audited. But now we're learning there was a pattern. There were huge numbers of conservative groups who were denied the exemption, and I believe there's probably large numbers of groups who were audited unfairly, as we were.There was not any reason in the world to audit the Claire Boothe Luce Policy Institute. And the first thing they asked for, Greta, in the first document request (INAUDIBLE) they asked for the names of all our contributors and the amounts of money they gave. Well, you know they can't get that! That is private information. And we had to fight and fight to secure the privacy of our supporters.VAN SUSTEREN: And I think there's even actually -- I think there's even case law in the Supreme Court about asking for the names of the membership...EASTON: There is.VAN SUSTEREN: ... which -- you know, which prevents it. So there -- at least, that was...(CROSSTALK) VAN SUSTEREN: ... improper question.EASTON: Civil Rights case.VAN SUSTEREN: NAACP versus Alabama was the case.EASTON: That's correct.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, now, the president has said that this stuff about the IRS, they're phony -- it's a phony scandal. And you say what?EASTON: Well, I say our whole tax system in America is based on the cooperation of the American people. But we've seen now -- we've seen that the IRS is really a political institution, and I say the IRS deserves the lack of confidence that American people really have in it now.VAN SUSTEREN: But the president is rather dismissive. He thinks that, you know, that you and others are just sort of, you know, you're -- you're (INAUDIBLE) and everybody else is talking about it is just drumming this up, that it's just silly and phony.EASTON: It's not going to work. The IRS is a huge bureaucracy that spreads fear in the hearts of individuals and organizations. And when they gang up on one particular part of people, of conservative people and conservative groups, there's nothing phony about that. It's abuse of governmental power!VAN SUSTEREN: Michelle, thank you very much. Good luck.EASTON: Thanks."	['Issa', 'Jordan', 'Hill', 'Obama']	[]
