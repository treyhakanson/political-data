This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Tonight, new information about the I.T. company in charge of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. The company Platte River Networks now getting a taste of what it's like to be at the center of presidential politics. The tech firm has remained quite, but one reporter just got the inside scopes. Speaking to top executives, that report from Rosalind S. Helderman from the ""Washington Post"" joins us now.Rosalind, nice to see you. And tell me, what do you learn from speaking to the representatives of the company?ROSALIND S. HELDERMAN, WASHINGTON POST: I've learned this has not been a fun experience for them in the last week or so. This is a small company in Denver. They've got 40 employees. They say 85 percent of their clients are located within an hour of the Denver metro area.And since it's broke, that they took on the management of Hillary Clinton server in 2013, a few months after she has left office. They've been getting hate calls and Twitter attacks. It's not been fun for them. I think the executive told me we're normal people. We're not used to this.VAN SUSTEREN: Are they democratic donors or how did they get the account to begin with.HELDERMAN: So that's a really interesting question that we haven't been able to figure out. The Clinton campaign has not answered our questions about that. They do not appear to have strong political ties. We're still working on that, but their top executives have not given political donations.They have not worked previously for large scale campaigns. We found they did $990 worth of work for a short lived gubernatorial campaign in Colorado, and that's pretty much it.And so they say that they submitted a proposal to the Clintons, Bill and Hillary Clinton in 2013 and were hired. They did not tell us it was one of the questions we asked that they didn't answer, how they knew that that opportunity existed to submit the proposal.VAN SUSTEREN: Any indication of the money involved to manage this account would be? Any thought, I mean, do you have any?HELDERMAN: We really don't know. I spoke to one former employee who speculated that for normal people, a server like this would not be big business. It's one server for a few e-mail accounts. But you got to imagine that given the level of the Clintons that they were probably paying some premium.VAN SUSTEREN: And I understand, they're coming as successful, I mean, well-respected in the Denver community, got an award.HELDERMAN: It seems to me they won the Small Business of the Year from the Denver Chamber of Commerce in 2012. They were runner-up for best I.T. company in a local business magazine this year. So they seem to be respected, but small and unusual choice for this level of activity.VAN SUSTEREN: I'm sure Rosalind, you will have more information on this. I suspect that you're going to do more reporting on this. Thank you very much.HELDERMAN: Thank you."	['Clinton']	[]
