This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Boling along with Jedediah Bila, Eboni Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""So breaking news in the 2016 race today, Donald Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski charged with misdemeanor battery over an incident with former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields at a campaign event earlier this month, Fields fired charges alleging Lewandowski forcefully grab her arm while she attempted to ask Trump a question. Lewandowski's attorney says his client is absolutely innocent and he's completely confident he will be exonerated. Both sides say this video you're watching right now benefits their case individually. Trump is adamantly standing by his aide.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Corey is a fine person. I looked at the tape, that the tapes were supplied by me. Tapes to me are very conclusive. A lot of people are looking and saying how can anybody be charged? He was actually -- if you look at her, in my book, and according to a lot of people, she's grabbing at me. And he's acting as an intermediary and trying to block her from doing that. The news conference was over. It was done. It was finished and she was running up and grabbing and asking questions. Very unfair to a good person, he's got a family. He's got four beautiful children. I think it is very, very unfair to a man who would take a wonderful family back in New Hampshire who gets, what, a criminal situation over that?(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: More now from chief political correspondent Carl Cameron. Carl, this is quite disruptive to these campaigns. Is it not?CARL CAMERON, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it doesn't come at a time to Donald Trump would like, but this sort of thing never could. But Donald Trump and Corey Lewandowski have argued from the very beginning that nothing ever happened, that there was no assault. There was no battery, and that it is completely overblown. And frankly, an attempt to smear Donald Trump by going through his staff; what Ted Cruz has called his henchmen in the last few days. The video does show Corey Lewandowski and the former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields engaged next to Donald Trump. The laws of Florida say any unauthorized, any unwanted touching can be construed as a possible, simple battery or misdemeanor battery. And it has already become a major distraction in this very important state of Wisconsin where Donald Trump is making his very first campaign appearance. He'll be doing so in Janesville, Wisconsin. The home of the House Speaker Paul Ryan, as both John Kasich and Ted Cruz are campaigning across the badger state, and now making an issue of this saying that in short, it comes from the top and there is a culture of violence and hostility in the world of Trump. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a very sad development. And this is the consequence of the culture of the Trump campaign. The abusive culture when you have a campaign that is built on personal insults, on attacks, and now physical violence.GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can only talk about what I would do. We probably would suspend somebody, you know. I think it depend what it is and what the evidence was. But we'll see things that we think are inappropriate, we take action.(END VIDEO CLIPS)CAMERON: In fact, John Kasich senior political adviser said if it was somebody who doesn't know, and then he probably would have been fired by now already, Eric?BOLLING: All right. Thank you, Carl. I appreciate the update. OK, we'll bring it around the table here a little bit. Eboni, Carl mentioned in Florida, any unauthorized touching could be simple misdemeanor battery.EBONI WILLIAMS, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah.BOLLING: That's not a very high bar to clear.WILLIAMS: No, it's not Eric. You know, it is about -- it can crime. It's a misdemeanor, so not a felony we're talking about. And here's what we know. Certainly --BOLLING: Can I just add?WILLIAMS: Sure.BOLLING: Is it an intent crime? Either there has to be some intent?WILLIAMS: There has to be some intention behind it. And this is where it gets interesting, right? I'm going to circle back to this. Let me just legally geek out for one second here. OK, so Corey hasn't been convicted. He still have this (inaudible) that time that he's proven guilty. But I want to say this. We know for the fact that law enforcement is actually brought charges now, criminal charges that they had to have probable cause, because you can't bring charges without it. Probable cause, that's a different standard of proof than beyond reasonable doubt, it says more probable than not; 51 percent likely all say that indeed, he did the crime alleged. Law enforcement -- they will release a statement and they said they relied heavily on the video provided by Trump organization, OK? And it looked very similar to Michelle's account of what happened. They take those together with other eyewitness testimony and they find probable cause. So that's why we had at least charges at this point. Now, when it comes to the feds, what will they're gonna argue? Because the tape looks for many people like, OK, there's a clear touching there. You argue the intent, Eric. You say well, maybe I brushed up on side or maybe I even grabbed her, but this was the reason why it was not to harm or damaged her. Corey has got a little bit over problem from the defense stand point to me, if he was my client I would be frustrated with a tweet that he sent out immediately following the event that said, ""I didn't touch her."" Because now you're denying something that factually looks in conflict.BOLLING: Dana, what is the optics of it right now? What should they be? What should the Trump campaign be doing?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, they should have done the right thing from the beginning which is, he should have apologized and then maybe it would not have escalated. But it is never wrong to do the right thing. And apologizing for something like that in the middle of a scrum, I think that would have been possibly acceptable to her. But when the first reaction is to lie about it and say it never happened, and then to try to smear her reputation. I mean, Donald Trump just said in his interview on the plane that it is unfair to Corey Lewandowski. But why is it fair to Michelle Fields to smear her reputation? She lost her job. She resigned, but it was basically because Breitbart didn't back her up. There are other things that she lost out on. The other thing from the optic standpoint is if you're the Trump campaign and you know you that you have vulnerability with women, and your numbers with women are going down. One, your instincts were to smear a young woman, two is to lie about it, and three now is to suggest that she's still in the wrong. I would say at this point, you should cut your losses because your track record of the last month with women is not going on get any better if this kind of things continues.BOLLING: Greg?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah. I mean, if this were the ""The Apprentice,"" Donald Trump would have fired Corey before he fired Kevin Jonas. That's how bad Corey is. I mean, he's -- so it tells you that Trump, somehow has standards that are higher for a TV show than he has for his own presidency. Back in Iowa, I expressed outrage over Corey Lewandowski's intentional intimidation of people at Fox News. The threats he was making. You'd better do this or watch out. I saw this as a problem. And it was problem for me because Donald Trump speaks about his goals, of only hiring the best people around him. And who is around him, this thug? Who is around him, Omarosa? I mean, let's be honest. He does not know what good people are. And you're right, he should do something. He should do something now. Remember, Donald didn't yank her. It is not Donald who did it.PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: It is the person who works for him. He should distance himself from him. But -- and one last thing, I think it all could have been avoided through actual conversation between two people. The problem is people now go on Twitter. So Michelle went on Twitter and her boyfriend went on Twitter. But they went on Twitter because who revolutionized going on Twitter for grievances -- Donald Trump. That's where he fights his battle are on Twitter. So that's where she went. They -- it was flurry of demeaning behavior from the Trump camp. They should have just said, hey, it was a mistake; that mistakes happen, and that all could have avoided. But instead, they forced her hand. Because as she said on Megyn Kelly, she did not want to press charges, but when somebody calls you delusional. When says he make up stuffs, calls you a liar, which Donald Trump did. They knew have no choice but to press charges to prove that you are sincere. And the conclusive proof is in that video. It's in that video.BOLLING: So I -- you're pointing the finger at Corey Lewandowski.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: . or Donald Trump?GUTFELD: I think Trump, Trump -- if Trump doesn't act then it's on him. And he's got to show that --PERINO: But he already has.GUTFELD: Yeah, I know. That's the sad thing. But he has to -- you should -- if you wants to be president, you have to have the temperament. You can't have thugs around you. You can't.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Jed, respond to that if you want.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: But do you remember about six months ago, it was a Rubio campaign adviser who punched a Rand Paul campaign person in the face, on tape. They had it. And it was in the state Michigan. And Michigan dropped it because it wasn't enough -- enough there.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: They define probable cause.GUTFELD: You think they deny it, though?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: That was on tape.GUTFELD: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)JEDEDIAH BILA, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah, but the problem here is you have a guy running for president who is a front-runner who is backing up a guy who lied, and Corey said, he didn't touch her. At one point I think he said he never met her, he never touched her. So once he's put that out there and that is determined to be a lie, I don't understand how Donald Trump isn't apologizing. Because he obviously believes someone who told a lie, that's not what we are seeing on tape, those footage of it. And at this point from a political perspective, this guy is a huge liability. He just does not help Donald Trump. I don't care about those people who are retweeting him and saying, yeah, Donald. Anyone with eyes who's sees the video knows that this guy lied and you're backing him up. So, you want to be a big man, be a big man and say you know what? This is not the story I heard. This is not how went down and have the guts to fire this guy, because obviously he doesn't have the guts to resign himself.BOLLING: So would anyone disagree with Corey Lewandowski now saying, you know what? It was busy. It was a media scrum. I was trying on get the candidate out.BILA: Where is the apology then?BOLLING: There are people -- so if he said, in the aftermath, I saw the video. You know what? It happened. I apologize. Would that --WILLIAMS: Ah, the lawyer would be freaking out, Eric. At this point, it is too late for that. At this point nothing --PERINO: Yeah.WILLIAMS: He can't make a statement like that. That would be in his legal disinterests. At this point he needs to have his day in court and argue a lack of intent around the contact at that point -- yeah.BOLLING: Wouldn't that be arguing a lack of intent? Look, I didn't realize. I didn't mean to hurt her, I just found --WILLIAMS: Yeah, but he's got to do that now in the court room.BOLLING: He's got to do in courtroom.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: But he already said, in his own words, that he never met her. That she is delusional. That she's a lair --BILA: Yeah.PERINO: I mean basically --WILLIAMS: And the prosecutors are going to ripped him for that if he goes on trial.PERINO: Yeah. So how can you now apologize? I mean, you've already had --BILA: He had --PERINO: You've been charged with a misdemeanor crime.BILA: He had a chance to apologize. And what -- I mean, once she tweeted out, she had -- she only said she had bruises. I mean, this was -- there was a space of time I think where this guy could have come out and said, you know what, I didn't realize that I injured you. That was not my intent. I apologize. You don't come out and try to slander somebody's reputation and say you never met them, when in fact, yeah, you did. You grabbed her arm and she was damaged as a result of it. This doesn't look good for him, and I'm sorry it doesn't look good for Donald.WILLIAMS: Politically, really quick, I think there's no upside to keeping Corey. That what --BILA: Right, exactly.WILLIAMS: The only down side. If I'm Donald Trump, to Greg's point, you disconnect, you distance yourself. As we're saying earlier, I'd rather cut off a toe than I have to cut a leg later.BOLLING: OK, let's talk -- let's do the politics on this.BILA: Yeah.BOLLING: Wisconsin is huge. Both of them went out -- if Donald Trump nails down Wisconsin, his path is clear. He if doesn't, Ted Cruz can make a case that it's less clear. Is will this affect Wisconsin?PERINO: Well, I don't think it helps. I don't know how much people will necessary be paying attention to it. And Donald Trump is there talking today, trying to talk today about jobs and the economy. One of the things that you want in a campaign is you want like a clear runway, so that you can focus on your message and should focus relentlessly on jobs and trade if you're going to be in Wisconsin. But if you're spending half the time on your interview on your fancy plane, talking about how your campaign manager, this poor guy, with his beautiful family, he's been attacked unfairly. But while this other is part of the story is that a young woman was attacked unfairly by the campaign, then that's probably not good. And I also think that republican women, the numbers, I don't know exactly what they are in Wisconsin, but that I believe that they track with the national numbers. The republican women, 37 percent were saying, OK, he could be our guy in the future. That was down to 24 percent in March. So -- at early March, and now so it is March 29, 30th. I don't think it is headed in the right direction.GUTFELD: But the other thing too is you think about people who, the team's sport -- ideology of sports, you know -- of politics. Once you are all in on something, it's almost impossible to change your mind. Because then, emotionally, you have to admit that you're wrong. So the genesis of this story was that, you know, it didn't happen. It did happen but it might have been the wrong guy who grabbed her. How could it happen if there's no tape? Whoa, there's tape, but it was nothing. Wait, in your tape shows that it is more than nothing. Well then, maybe she deserved it because of the scrum of the reporters. No matter what happens, there will always be a strong, vocal supportive group of Trump supporters who will say, eh!BILA: Yeah. But you know what? A lot of those people who (inaudible) me is a lot of people supporting Trump. If this were President Obama, one of the key issues, though.GUTFELD: Or they go down lower.BILA: . was that President Obama doesn't know how to say, I was wrong. And guess what, they're right about that. When he makes a mistake or he makes a misjudgment or he speaks too soon or something, whether involves police or what not, and you find that out. You want to say, why can't you say I had it wrong? Have some humility.(CROSSTALK)BILA: Right.GUTFELD: Yeah.BILA: So that's, you know what, demand the same thing from the guy who has values that you admire, who has economic policies that you admire. You can't have one set of rules for the guy whose politics differ from yours and other set for the guy whose politics are the same. Demand the same standard across the board.GUTFELD: Absolutely.BOLLING: Final thought?WILLIAMS: Yeah. I mean, I think it's an opportunity, right? For Donald Trump to kind of demonstrate the leadership, you used ""The Apprentice"" example. He's the guy that can make the hard decisions. This is a hard, difficult decision. I understand there is a temptation, maybe on the Trump camp to show loyalty to his person. But you know, do the right thing. Do the thing that makes legal sense. They're really, the politically savvy thing. It was just about doing the right thing.BOLLING: All right, we have to go. Make sure to catch our powerful primetime lineup. Tonight, I'm filling in for Bill O'Reilly and we'll have more on the charges today against Trump's campaign manager at 8:00 p.m. eastern. At 10:00 p.m., Trump gives his reaction on ""Hannity,"" a big night ahead. Coming up why Hillary Clinton's camp is threatening not to do any more debates with Bernie Sanders, ahead on ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Bernie Sanders is fighting hard to narrow the delegate gap with Hillary Clinton, and he is calling for more debates this time in Clinton's home turf of New York before the States primary on April 19th. Clinton's camp calls the latest debate request a stunt and says they'll only consider Sanders to request for another debate if he changes his tone.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOEL BENENSON, CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHIEF STRATEGIST: Senator Sanders doesn't get to decide when we debate, particularly when he's running a very negative campaign against us. Let's see if he goes back to the kind of tone he said he was going to set early on. If he does that, then we'll talk about debates. But we're not going to talk about it.KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ""AT THIS HOUR"" HOST: So no chance of a New York debate?BENENSON: I didn't say that. I said we're not going to talk about it. We're going to see what kind of tone he sets. If his campaign wants to run the kind of negative campaign and run the negative ads like they did in North Carolina, in Illinois, all over the country on March 15th, that's going to be disappointing to a lot of democrats who feel we have to start focusing on republicans whether it's Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, and about our differences, so we win in November. That's what democrats ought to be doing. That's what she's doing.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Sanders hit back by posting this video on his Twitter page of Clinton during her 2008 campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Honestly, I mean, I just believe that this is the most important job in the world. It's the toughest job in the world. You should be willing to campaign for every vote. You should be willing to debate anytime, anywhere.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So Greg, I have a theory of why she doesn't want to debate in New York.GUTFELD: How come?PERINO: Because she doesn't want Bernie to be able to say, your ties to Wall Street, the guy is right down here that paid you $600,000 for speeches, that's who you're in the pocket of. So she doesn't want to avoid a debate in New York.GUTFELD: That's an excellent theory.PERINO: Thank you.GUTFELD: Which I don't have an answer for it.PERINO: OK. What do you want talk about?GUTFELD: I want to say that she is the last person on earth to lecture anyone on tone. She sounds like the product of two car alarms mating. Do you know what she's guilty of? A lot of people don't bring up, misandry, which is bigotry against men. She is saying she is criticizing Bernie's tone, but what if that's how men sound? Remember, when people were criticizing Hillary, there was people were saying, well, oh, they're criticizing her because that's how a woman sounds when she's loud. Well, she's just doing the same thing. Maybe that's how a man sounds when he is being serious and he wants to express a point. But she's -- and the other part is, she's kind of saying that she's a delicate flower, which would be offensive to women.PERINO: But what -- so Jedediah, how can he change his tone? I mean, there -- what Ben has been saying is that he is so negative towards her. But he doesn't even bring up any of her vulnerable points.BILA: He's been so --PERINO: What so did they want to change?BILA: He's been so -- maybe she wants him to be less likable so he can be more like her. I mean, I don't know. She -- it's ridiculous. He's been bating (ph) her. I'm sitting at home watching those debates saying, come on, Bernie, talk about the e-mail.PERINO: He can do it.BILA: . talk about transparency. You can do it. And he's not going there. So I don't know what expects to me that doesn't play well for her. She looks like a big baby and she looks like she's afraid of him. And I think she should be. This is the guy who came out in nowhere, basically. He is much more likable than she is. He's got a lot of Hollywood on his side. He has a lot of young voters. He is doing a lot of what President Obama did very well, which is to get people excited. You've got, you know, the likes of Susan Sarandon out there saying that she's not going to vote for Hillary, she want to vote for Bernie Sanders. So I think she's intimidated by what, and I think you're right. I think Wall Street is a super soft, a sore point for her. And I think being here, he'll have the opportunity to highlight that, and she can't take the heat.PERINO: Eric, I have another theory that if she wins in Wisconsin on next Tuesday, April 5th, that there will be no debate in New York City. That she won't agree to it. But that if she loses in Wisconsin, she'll be worried and she'll ask for that debate.BOLLING: I'm going to disagree -- agree with your first one and disagree with the second. I think this is brilliant strategy. She is putting it out right now. Basically, and the tone, the way I read this is, well, it is like the panthers playing the stealers. The panthers like to play the stealers where they only agree to pay the defense, when they're not going to put an offense. When Ben Roethlisberger is on the bench, they like playing him. But if Ben gets back in the game, panthers don't want to play the Stealers.GUTFELD: Hillary was there.BOLLING: No, Hillary Clinton --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Hillary Clinton doesn't want to go up against Bernie Sanders when he's going to go negative on her. She wants, and just -- she wants to go against him when he's just pro- Bernie. But going negative on her will work. So she says, ""I got to lead. I'm about to lock this thing down. Why would i risk it?"" And you know, Dana, once she gets past Wisconsin, we get north east where there is the high level of African-American voters. She is going to lock it down. There's no reason to blow it now.PERINO: What's the consternation, the level of concern on the democrat side, Ebony, about the super delegate process, which is one of the most undemocratic things. The republican primary process is a mess. You could consider it that in terms of she's organized. But it's highly democratic compared to what the super delegate process is that Bernie is complaining about.WILLIAMS: No. I think it is a hot mess, Dana. And I think that this is where Bernie supporters get really, you know, excited about an uproar. Revolution -- we hear this revolution concept, it around. This have to super delegate stuff. And you know, Bernie saying like, you know, I don't stand a chance with those rules that play. And that's why he is saying, I won, you know, four -- five contests over the weekend or something. Let these super delegates reconsider. And listen to the constituency. I want to say this about the tone issue, though. I think it's highly -- it's the height of hypocrisy for Hillary Clinton and her camp to talk about Bernie Sanders' tone being inappropriate, when this guy, her chief strategist rather, Benenson says that Sanders is going to campaign like a Brooklynite.GUTFELD: No.WILLIAMS: Because the senator --PERINO: That's true.WILLIAMS: That's, that is what --GUTFELD: That is (inaudible) of course of something.WILLIAMS: And she will be in campaign like a senator. You like Brooklyn shaming this man. I mean --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Is there something else?WILLIAMS: I mean what in the world?WILLIAMS: Is there something else behind that when you say Brooklynite? Isn't that alluding to being a Jew?WILLIAMS: Oh stop it.GUTFELD: Yeah, perhaps?WILLIAMS: No, but that --PERINO: That seems to me.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: All right Greg, I see your point there. But no, just -- I don't like that. I mean.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: This is the guy (inaudible), that's' where he's from. I don't think, you know, I have a bit of a southern thing going on.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I think it was a bet, but --GUTFELD: I thought just anti-Semitic.PERINO: But he was editor longer than she has.GUTFELD: She's an anti- Semi.BILA: I love his tone.(CROSSTALK)BILA: If I were the government girl, I will be filling that --(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)BILA: I would.(LAUGHTER)BILA: I like his tone.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Right. It's only good when she is there. Not when Bernie, yeah.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: I don't think that was really nasty. And I assume he like that.GUTFELD: He actually pledges to listen too.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Everything she said is wrong.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Everything she said is wrong --BOLLING: Let's just hope he's the nominee.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: Who wouldn't want to go up against a socialist?GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: All right next.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . free speech, Donald Trump, and some chalk are distressing a bunch of college students down in Georgia. Greg's (inaudible) them when we return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Imagine a place that poisons your teens' emotional well-being, targeting their vulnerabilities, laying waste to their spine, inculcating weakness, replacing reason with hysteria. Once designed for enrichment, it's now an ego asylum, where character is reduced to a bubbling stew of anguish. That is college.At Emory University, pro-Trump messages in chalk have scarred co-eds so badly student government is offering counseling -- poor things. Yes, the phrase Trump 2016 found on cement is so harrowing to these sucklings, the school president sent a sympathy email.Now the scribbles could have been solve easily by erasing them. It is chalk after all. But that something an adult would do. These are emotional toddlers. Babble buckets. Forget about a wall on the Southern border. Build it around Emory. Observe the offensive words, I know, I'm getting vapors just looking at them. Can the National Guard please air drop fainting couches, warm blankies and smelling salts to these wuss kittens?This is the new lie of the campus left: that one must balance free speech with feeling safe. College must be a safe haven, safe from words. But college is supposed to challenge, not coddle. Doing the reverse, just leads to fake incidents of hate that provide spotlights to these attention gobblers.So while this happened, the U.S. military is evacuating families of Defense personnel from southern Turkey due to security fears. Maybe the Emory students can trade places and find out what a real unsafe space is all about.So apparently now, ""Trump '16"" is a bigoted statement. How could...BILA: I know.GUTFELD: That is amazing.BILA: Everything is offensive. You can't say anything anymore. It's so scary to me. I worry so much about the future. Because can you imagine sending these kids off to war? I mean, no really, if you...GUTFELD: How about their first jobs?BILA: Forget it, everything. And there's this extended adolescence that's happening now. And I've dated guys in their 20s. It's scary.GUTFELD: That's on you.BILA: They want a safe space from me. Apparently, I'm dangerous.GUTFELD: Date people in their 50s.BILA: Yes, I'm getting there. But, you know, I just -- I will. That's next.But it's crazy. It's like when you go to college, and when I was younger, that was supposed to toughen you up.GUTFELD: Yes.BILA: It was supposed to challenge you. You were supposed to go into classrooms and hear different opinions and get uncomfortable. Part of growing is discomfort.GUTFELD: Tell me about it.BILA: These kids don't know -- especially for you. These kids don't know what that means because they're coddled. The good thing is some of these students fought back. The Young Americans for Liberty at Emory fought back, and they had a ""make Emory great again"" slogan that they put - good for them. Because these deans and administrators, what a bunch of babies.GUTFELD: Yes.BILA: Catering to parents. And get a back bone.GUTFELD: It is creating a healthy pushback. Eboni, one of the activists claim that the phrase ""Trump 2016"" put them in pain, and one said, quote, ""We have nothing to lose by our -- but our chains.""I don't even know what that -- that's a bit insulting.BOLLING: Is that what you want, to get rid of the chains?GUTFELD: I don't get it.WILLIAMS: I don't know what that means. I mean, this is like -- it's so silly, and it is laughable, in a way. But the serious part of this is this. Racial intimidation on college campuses, that's a real thing. That actually happens. You know, ask the students at Duke University last year, where there were nooses on campus. Students at the University of Delaware, nooses. So that -- by all means, if Trump 2016 is your threshold for racial intimidation, seriously, God bless you.PERINO: Better not drive down the highway and see the bumper stickers.WILLIAMS: Yes, it's crazy.PERINO: Like have a panic attack and run into another car.GUTFELD: Eric, I have a theory. Your son is about to go to college.BOLLING: Right.GUTFELD: I think there should be two college systems: the classic one that challenges you and the adult daycare. It's separated.BOLLING: There are. And there's going to be a handful, like Hillsdale College, like five or six university that are in the classic, where they don't treat kids like they're babies and they're wussies and whatnot. But the rest -- the vast majority of the rest of liberal -- of higher learning in America are like that and moving fast and faster towards that. You said build a wall around Emory. Build a wall around 80, 90 percent of the universities in the country. It's sad. It's scary as a parent.GUTFELD: Have the students pay for it.BOLLING: That's totally...GUTFELD: Pay for it.PERINO: Parents will pay for it.BOLLING: The parents pay for it.PERINO: The parents ask them to pay for it.GUTFELD: Do we have time...BOLLING: Can we make the professors pay for it?GUTFELD: Yes. They're on tenure any way. It's not like they have to afford anything.Do we talk to just talk about what's going on in Wisconsin right now?PERINO: I can't shame the Georgian...GUTFELD: Shame them. Shame. Shame them right now.PERINO: I just did.GUTFELD: OK. Trump -- Trump is getting ready to speak. This is a rally in Janesville. Again, this speaks to a lot of the irrational, this irrational behavior that Trump seems to cause.PERINO: That's not irrational. They're just...GUTFELD: Protesting, that's true.PERINO: ... protesting in the normal fashion.GUTFELD: I think it's irrational.PERINO: Because you don't go to a protest. But like, if you -- if you have strong feelings for or against somebody, and you want to go hold up a placard and walk around...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ... and not punch people, that's OK.WILLIAMS: That's America.PERINO: Just don't get out the chalk.GUTFELD: I'm saying the hate is -- the hate is so strong.PERINO: I don't think so.GUTFELD: No?PERINO: Well, not when they're just like placards, and you're walking around saying this is what you believe in. And that guy just waved to us. I mean, hello.GUTFELD: Yes, he's friendly. But apparently, there's been one or two incidents, I think, involving pepper spray.BILA: Do you feel unsafe, Greg?GUTFELD: I feel unsafe. I need to be hugged.BILA: You think so?GUTFELD: Yes, I'm going to hug Ingraham (ph), later. All right.BILA: We'll get around to that in the commercial break.GUTFELD: I'm done with you, and everybody else.Ahead, President Obama lectures the media for letting the 2016 candidates off easy, like it did for him eight years ago. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BILA: President Obama is once again lecturing journalists on their coverage of this year's presidential election. He's calling on the media to hold candidates and themselves to a higher standard, not just deliver profits for shareholders.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Also has an obligation to invest a good chunk of that profit back into news and back into public affairs and to maintain certain standards. And to not dumb down the news. The electorate would be better served if we spent less time focused on the ""he said, she said"" back and forth of our politics. Because while fairness is the hallmark of good journalism, false equivalency all too often these days can be a fatal flaw.(END VIDEO CLIP)BILA: The president argues today's candidates aren't being held accountable or getting the same kind of scrutiny when he ran for the White House.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: If you go back and see what I said in 2007, and you see what I did, they match up.In 2008 in the campaign, people asked me really tough questions about whether they matched up. And we had a spend a lot of time worrying about whether what I said I could deliver on.(END VIDEO CLIP)BILA: So we looked back in our archives to see whether that comment matched up. Here's what we found.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR: The feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama speak, my -- I felt this thrill go up my leg. I don't have that too often.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's almost hard to remain objective, because the -- it's infectious.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Coffee or tea?OBAMA: Tea.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Beatles or Rolling Stones.OBAMA: Rolling Stones.(END VIDEO CLIP)BILA: Tough stuff, Greg.GUTFELD: Yes.BILA: As I remember, the hardest question he got around 2008 was from Joe the Plumber...GUTFELD: Right.BILA: ... who met him on the street and asked him about wealth redistribution and forced him to have a conversation about what he actually wanted to do. So what's he talking about? Come on.GUTFELD: What I love is he's lecturing our media, something that he couldn't do in Cuba at all. That would have been too brave and too Reagan- esque to say, ""Tear down your media wall."" So instead he comes here, Tang- obama, was busy sight-seeing.I said this too many times, but I'm going to repeat myself. He's the quarterback who slept with every cheerleader but still mad that one won't. And that one was FOX News. We weren't that easy, so we didn't jump into bed with him.And it just reflects that -- the human nature that we seek comfort in our shared assumptions. We love the media until it's divorced from us. Everybody is like this.BILA: What about what he's saying, Dana, about, like, gossip sometimes. We focus on gossip. Sometimes I feel like with the gossipy angle, sometimes it's news. The stuff with Ted Cruz and Donald Trump going at each other over their wives and whatnot, that's still a story. It's part of the presidential battle.PERINO: And it will show the character of somebody, for sure. But yesterday, one of the things we talked about was the ""Washington Post"" article by Robert O'Hara Jr. about Hillary Clinton's e-mail scandal and the root of it. And it's long and exhaustive.So exhaustive journalism exists if you look for it and if you take time to read it. It is true that the back and forth is really important. I was kind of laughing a little bit. One of the things President Obama has done very well is to use things like ""Between Two Ferns,"" or going on Fallon and all the late-night shows, going on ""Ellen"" and going on -- using popular culture to drive the news in order to achieve his campaign goals. They're not asking you a lot of, like, really in-depth questions on those shows. But he was very successful in using them in order to help advance his political goals.BILA: Every time it seems that he gets tough questions, Eric, when someone like a Bill O'Reilly or whoever asks him a huge question, he's defensive. He's almost like, ""The audacity you had to ask me something that's actually challenging."" And everyone sees that. So how does he come off saying this?BOLLING: So he wants us, I guess, to stop covering his golfing, you know, the headings on the golfing or the baseball games and the wave, or the tango and instead ask tough questions: ""Well, OK, President Obama. But income inequality, you ran on income inequality. It's worse under you. How about wages? Wages are down under you. How about household net worth and household incomes are both down under you?""He answered those. Yes, ISIS is the JV team. What are you talking about? They're still killing people under you.Be sure you know what you're asking for. And if that's really what you want to get, that's fine. But if there is a Republican president next, will the rules still apply to them? Or is -- everyone has to just be serious right now?BILA: Right. Like, does he want the tough questions for everybody else, but for him just what he had for dinner last night and who he's rooting for in whatever this March Madness stuff is Eric keeps talking about is?WILLIAMS: I once heard the president say that. I actually thought he was harkening back to his primary season. And I do think during that, at least from what I recall, I do think he was asked very tough questions. And I think there was a reason behind it. I'm talking about him and Hillary in their primary portion.Because people were unfamiliar for Barack Obama. He was brand-new to the United States, and people didn't know who he was or what he was about. So sure, he was asked very tough questions about foreign policy and would you be ready to answer the phone call at 3 a.m.I also think that's why we saw from Marco Rubio, when he was still in it, that he would knee-jerk to those kind of long-winded policy questions. They're trying to show, in their youth and relative political inexperience, that they are capable. I think -- that's what I took of his context.BILA: See, I remember Hillary taking a beating from reporters. I remember seeing Hillary would say, ""Hold on. I thought I was going to get a free ride here. And now all of a sudden, this guy is getting all the easy questions.""WILLIAMS: I remember brutal debates. I thought that 2008 primary on the Dems side was absolutely brutal. And I thought they both were questioned heavily.GUTFELD: There's one thing that he brought up quickly about the -- how he said that the false equivalency is a problem, meaning there really isn't two sides to every story. He's alluding to something like climate change where you have to be strongly -- you must strongly endorse his view of climate change. But the idea of being skeptical of any part of it is false. There cannot be two sides, because there might only be one right answer.PERINO: The other thing was on the profits.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: He said that -- he was talking about media companies. And, you know, there is -- there is a group of people who think that something like a publicly-funded media would be better. We have a few of those, actually.WILLIAMS: Yes, I know.PERINO: But media companies exist, and there's jobs for it. And there are profits.BILA: Well, that's true.Well, our very own Geraldo Rivera promised a surprise for week two of ""Dancing with the Stars,"" and viewers got one. But it wasn't enough to keep him in contention for that Mirrorball trophy. Hear Geraldo's explanation for what happened on FOX News this morning. That's coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: It was Latin night on ""Dancing with the Stars."" But even Geraldo's genetic advantage couldn't save him from becoming the first contestant to get the boot. But he did put up a solid effort to make his dancing great again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS: Vladimir, hi, it's Donald. That was huge. It was huge.Hey, Vlad, can you hold on for a second? Melania.(MUSIC)TOM BERGERON, HOST, ABC'S ""DANCING WITH THE STARS"": The first couple to be eliminated this season is Geraldo and Edyta.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: You've got to hand it to him, that was a pretty hilarious Trump impersonation. He and his partner, Edyta, gave a postmortem on ""FOX & Friends"" this morning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE DOOCY, CO-HOST, ""FOX & FRIENDS"": Geraldo, what happened?RIVERA: Well, we had a wonderful professional, elegant, talented, charismatic dancer teamed with a 72-year-old one-legged man.DOOCY: You can't feel one of your feet, correct?RIVERA: It doesn't make me a bad person.DOOCY: Edyta, how do you feel?EDYTA SLIWINSKA, PROFESSIONAL DANCER, ABC'S ""DANCING WITH THE STARS"": I feel like he did so great. I'm a little bit sad, because I think Geraldo brings so much more to this show. But, you know, being eliminated is not such a bad thing. Now we get to hang out. Not in a dance studio.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: OK. That's hilarious. Was she just not giving anyone else here Melania light but me? Like she really legitimately kind of reminded me of her.OK, so we got Tucker Carlson out after the first week, Geraldo Rivera out after the first week. Greg Gutfeld, how long do you go in this thing?GUTFELD: I would go to the very end, because I'm a hell of a dancer.This would have been better if the Oval -- if they had done the Oval Office skit but it was Bill Clinton instead of Donald Trump, because the dancing would have been more interesting.I have an idea for a reality show called ""Dancing Drunk,"" judged by -- you get judged how you dance with every ensuing shot. Because that's how people dance, getting progressively drunker at weddings. That would be a tremendous reality show.BILA: That's true.WILLIAMS: Liquid Rhythm. I like it, I like it.OK, Dana, what would be your preferred dance? Are you a tango gal? Are you a salsa? What are you?PERINO: I would love to learn all of it in the privacy of, like, with no cameras, nothing. I -- I find public speaking not to be a problem at all. I could never have done what Geraldo did.WILLIAMS: Really?PERINO: I think I would be so nervous. I couldn't have done it. I almost threw up when I was on ""Celebrity Jeopardy."" I definitely could not have danced in front of the cameras.WILLIAMS: So we won't see you...GUTFELD: ""Celebrity Bombing.""WILLIAMS: ... in a leotard and a spray tan. OK, good to know, Dana.OK, Eric, you strike me -- this is just me, because you know you're my all- American guy. Ballroom, top hat. I see it. I see it. Is this something you would do?BOLLING: I would do it, but I can't dance ballroom. I mean, no, no, no.Gracious, Geraldo, gracious in defeat. I mean, he literally said, ""If I wasn't voted off, I would have demanded a recount."" Right. He saw it coming.But great shirt. Great job, Geraldo. Way to go for it. Look, he tried. I'm all for trying stuff.PERINO: I can't do step, I should say.WILLIAMS: I can do a little.PERINO: That's not that hard. It's like country dancing is, like, easy.BILA: I would do it. I had good rhythm, but I don't remember steps. But I'd have to bring my mother in. She's an amazing dancer. She can come in, and she can teach me. I would salsa, though. I'd keep it sexy. Why not?GUTFELD: Polka.WILLIAMS: You're a polka?GUTFELD: Polka is amazing. Don't...PERINO: You would do the Hokey-Pokey.GUTFELD: No, the polka is an amazing dance.WILLIAMS: OK, well, you wouldn't catch me dancing live.""One More Thing"" is up next.You want to polka?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: ""One More Thing"" and Greg starts.GUTFELD: All right. Back by popular demand. People say that without any proof at all. Greg and Dana's Town Hall. April 24. It's a Sunday at the Hershey Theater in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Special guest, of course, opening will be Larry Gatlin. We'll have a meet and greet. We'll talk about politics, the campaign, the election. We'll talk about dogs and booze and books. Go to GGutfeld.com or HersheyEntertainment.com to pick up tickets. It will be great.BOLLING: And that is a fantastic venue. That's a great venue.PERINO: I've never been.BOLLING: Oh, it's amazing. Hershey is awesome.PERINO: I heard it's beautiful.BOLLING: Yes.All right, Dana, you're up.PERINO: All right. Do you know anybody who likes to complain about anything, especially the weather? There's a new thing in Australia done by an artist called Angela Garrick. She created Weather Vent, where you can call and you can vent on a voicemail about the weather, which I thought was pretty funny. But nothing could match this one. This is a little sound bite of one of the voicemails left behind.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's so hot today. Kills me. I wish it was cold. I got tar all over me because it was so hot the bike handles melted on this bike. Now I feel fried. Cause I've been cooking all day.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Fantastic.PERINO: Everyone's playing it over and over again, this one.GUTFELD: Lou Dobbs.PERINO: Anyway, Weather Vent.BOLLING: Is -- is marijuana legal in Australia?All right. So tonight, make sure you check out ""O'Reilly Factor."" Stick around, 8 a.m. tonight. Actually, all night. Just check out the primetime lineup. Don't change the channel tonight. We're going to go deep this whole controversy with Corey Lewandowski.Last Wednesday we had these puppies on this show right here to be adopted. This was through the Humane Society of New York. And OK, you see them all there, right there. So three of those dogs have been adopted.PERINO: That was cute.BILA: So cute.BOLLING: And these two right here -- hold on, hold on. These two still waiting to get adopted. That's Viola and Antoine. Make sure you go to HumaneSociety.com.PERINO: Antoine was the one that Jesse was holding. He was scared of it.GUTFELD: The way I hold a child.BOLLING: Guess he didn't like that one. Anyway, adopt those dogs, or others. HumaneSociety.com.Who's up next? Jedediah.BILA: Me, yes. So today we have another one of Greg's friends causing destruction. Meet Harley, the cockatoo. As you can see, there's plenty of space in this room. Yet Harley feels the need to knock these blocks over repeatedly, Greg, setting a bad example once again.Actually, this cockatoo hates blocks. It's been known. There's a YouTube channel that the owners have devoted, YouTube, packed by Hollywood cockatoo. And apparently, lots of blocks are knocks over. So you definitely want to check it out. He's adorable, unlike someone at this table. (AUDIO GAP)BOLLING: Eboni, you're up.WILLIAMS: Thank you so much.OK. So everybody could use a hug, right? Even NBA players. Check out this super cute video. This is last night at the New York Knicks game in New Orleans. The Knicks were down in the fourth quarter. Look at this cute little kid, runs out there and gives Carmelo Anthony a hug. Chin up, Carmelo. You got this one. That's so cute. And I don't know if you guys saw it, but Melo gave him a little pat on the head, because he, like, welcomed it.BOLLING: I think he was posted (ph) Carmelo.PERINO: That could be dangerous, actually.WILLIAMS: He went straight to him. He made a beeline.BOLLING: I think that was an offensive foul. That's a charge.WILLIAMS: I like it. You know what? Flop.Why ask for permission?

"This is a rush transcript from ""Journal: Editorial Report,"" May 14, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  This week on the ""Journal: Editorial Report,"" Donald Trump goes to Washington.  A look at his meeting with Paul Ryan and where they're likely to agree and disagree.  Plus, Bernie Sanders will take it to the convention after polls show he will be the stronger candidate in November.  So will Hillary be saved by the super delegates?And in the battle for campaign cash, Trumps turns to big-money donors.  Can he compete with a Clinton money machine?  But first, these headlines.  (FOX NEWS REPORT)GIGOT:  Welcome to the ""Journal: Editorial Report.""  I'm Paul Gigot.  ""A positive step,"" that is how presumptive GOP nominee, Donald Trump, and House Speaker Paul Ryan described their meeting on Capitol Hill Thursday. In a joint statement, the two said they were totally committed to unifying a divided Republican Party ahead of the November election, but both men acknowledged that the process could take some time.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  This was our first meeting. I was encouraged with this meeting.  But this is a process.  It takes a little time.  You don't put it together in 45 minutes.  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE & CEO, TRUMP ORGANIZATION:  I don't mind going through a little bit of a slow process.  It's a very big subject.  I mean, we have a lot of things.  And I think, for the most part, we agree on a lot of different items.  And we're getting there.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Joining the panel this week Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; Potomac Watch columnist, Kim Strassel; associate editorial page editor, James Freeman; and Best of the Web Today columnist, James Taranto.  So, James, how much of this sweetness and light is real and how much tension is still existing behind the scenes?  JAMES TARANTO, BEST OF THE WEB TODAY COLUMNIST:  I think the real tension is the tension between the supporters of these two men, the Trump supporters who can't stand Washington, and the Ryan supporters who are --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Can't stand Trump.  (LAUGHTER)TARANTO:  Right, can't stand Trump, think he isn't a real conservative and so forth.  So I think this is a negotiation between the two of them, that is whose ultimate objective is to bring their followers along reluctantly. And from that standpoint, it's important the negotiation not take place too quickly.  Imagine if Ryan came out last week and said, well, Trump is the nominee, I endorse him.  He would have been viewed by these conservatives as a sellout and his endorsement would be worth a lot less.  (CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Well, they have to -- well, wait, I take your point.But there's some philosophical differences here, James, profound between Ryan and Trump on trade, foreign policy, immigration.  We can't -- is that going to emerge later on?  JAMES FREEMAN, ASSOCIATE EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  I would argue that there are not deep philosophical differences because I think what you have with Ryan is a philosophical conservative for limited government.  I think with Trump, you have a non-ideological candidate.  So where they do have things in common, they both think Washington needs to get off the back of business.  That means lower taxes, less regulation.  Obviously, they have a lot of differences, on trade and immigration.  I would hope that this discussion allows --(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN:  -- Ryan to pull him a little bit that way but they agree on the fundamental idea, which is you've got to get the American economy growing like it used to.  GIGOT:  But also on political style, Dan.  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR:  Yeah.GIGOT:  Ryan is -- has rhetoric that's inclusive.  He wants to reach out and to expand the party, reach out to minorities.  Trump, what we know, his caustic style, his attack style.  I mean, you know, we know in private that Donald Trump can be very charming.  HENNINGER:  Right.GIGOT:  Because we've met with him in private.  And no doubt he was in that meeting.  But do you ever think there's going to be a Ryan/Trump condominium?  HENNINGER:  Well, one would hope so.  I think the short answer of what they said after that meeting is the Republican Party, a major political party, is not unified, all right?  GIGOT:  Right.  HENNINGER:  I think it goes beyond merely the supporters out there in the country.  Paul Ryan represents all the members of the House that have to stand for re-election and about seven Republican Senators whose seats are at risk.  And their position is now either, I'm behind Trump, I'm against Trump, or I don't know whether to support him or not.  That's a confused Republican party running against Democrats who are going to be united and energized running against Donald Trump.  So I think the Republicans are on their back feet right now because of this disunity.  GIGOT:  Kim, what about the point that James Taranto made that some of Paul Ryan's supporters are inclined -- are already saying, ""sellout, how dare you, you're damaging your reputation by even associating with Donald Trump,"" and appearing to say, you know, things are moving forward.  KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Look, I mean, I think this is a very Paul Ryan thing he has done.  You look back over his entire history in the House as speaker, this is a guy known for bringing along members of his conference to issues that are difficult sometimes for them to get behind. He's a very reform-minded politician.  And my view is that probably part of this was set up as an opportunity to get to know Trump and maybe potentially at the first opportunity to present to Trump -- who, by the way, has run a fairly isolated campaign, outside of Washington.GIGOT:  Right.STRASSEL:  To say, look, these are our concerns, this is what we're facing as an electoral pressure out there, we need you to be aware, and these are some of the issues that our followers have, and maybe try to sort of pull him along in an optimistic way.  GIGOT:  And the self-interest of Ryan, James, here, political self- interest, is what?  TARANTO:  Well, he doesn't want to throw the election, as some conservative intellectuals would like the Republicans to do.  He wants the Republican Party to be unified to win.  He's going to do better under a President Trump even if they don't agree on everything than he would do under a President Hillary Clinton, which would be, as he put it, another four years of Obama.  GIGOT:  And he wants to prevent a wipeout, a Republican wipeout.  If Trump does as poorly as the polls suggest, some polls suggest he might, then you don't want to lose the House because it's the only barrier against progressive government like 2009 and 2010.  FREEMAN:  Right.  And along the lines we were talking about, I think conservatives can get comfortable thinking about what a Ryan/Trump partnership would lead to.  But, hey, this blow-out stuff, we've looked at Trump's sky high negative ratings over the last year.  All of a sudden, you look at some of these polls, Quinnipiac, he's ahead in Ohio --(CROSSTALK)  GIGOT:  One poll.  Yeah, OK.  FREEMAN:  But this may be, all of a sudden, a much closer race than people expected.  GIGOT:  When we come back, Bernie Sanders promising to fight on to the convention after new polls show trouble for Hillary Clinton in some key battleground states.  So will she be saved by the super delegates?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Fresh off a double-digit win in West Virginia, the Sanders campaign said Wednesday the Democratic Party would be courting disaster by nominating Hillary Clinton.  In a fundraising e-mail, campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, cited what he called a scary new Quinnipiac University poll showing Clinton virtually tied with or losing to Donald Trump in the battleground states of Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio.  That same poll shows Sanders running stronger against the likely Republican nominee.  In the e-mail, Weaver told supporters, quote, ""Because we must do everything we can to defeat Trump in November, our mission is to win as many pledged delegates as we can between now and June 14th, then we're going to have a contested convention.""So, Kim, I think most people agree that, barring an act of God or an act of FBI Director Jim Comey, Hillary Clinton will be the nominee.  But how much trouble can Bernie Sanders cause her between now and the convention?  STRASSEL:  If you look at the number of pledged delegates out there now, there is only a difference of less than 300 between Bernie -- between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.  And also, Paul, the momentum has been with Sanders.  You know, we have a handful of primary contests and caucuses left.  If he were to run the table on those, which, by the way, is possible that he could, he will have won 19 of the 25 last primaries and caucuses in this race.  GIGOT:  Wow.  STRASSEL:  So, yeah.GIGOT:  Wow.STRASSEL:  Exactly.  That number is real.  And he'd have won about 55 percent of the delegates since Super Tuesday.  So her claim isn't necessarily as strong, especially if it's a claim based entirely on super delegates, which increasingly it is.  GIGOT:  Dan, what is this?  Is this buyer's remorse among Democrats, recognizing she may be a weak candidate?  What's going on?  HENNINGER:  It's definitely recognizing that she could be a weak candidate. They probably should have seen that from the beginning, but here we are. They thought she was just going to waltz to the nomination.  Bernie Sanders comes in, you know, from left field, literally, and suddenly, he's got all the support from young Democratic voters.  And now they don't know how to deal with these people.  And now we're going to go to the convention in Philadelphia, the Sanders people are all going to get into a battle with the Democratic National Committee.  Debbie Wassermann Schultz is stiffing them on committee chairmanships for the convention, and they're talking about not accepting that, and they're going to want a role in the platform in Philadelphia, they're going to want a role in prime spiking engagements, and it's all going to be Bernie's message, which Hillary is trying so hard to get away from so she can run to the center in the general.  GIGOT:  James, I know you hang with the Sandersistas.  (LAUGHTER)So what I want to know is do they want -- other than the things Dan suggested -- do they want Bernie on the ticket?  Is that a possibility?  FREEMAN:  Well, I think when you look at it now, I think they still -- I think the dream lives that he will be the nominee.  I think that dream is alive, and those polls hearten them.  I think also, if you think about it, if he managed to run the table here and actually came into Philadelphia with a delegate lead among the delegates actually chosen by rank-and-file voters, which could theoretically still happen, you have an implosion in the Democratic party because I do not think you can sustain a Clinton nomination on the idea of pledged or super delegates, the party insiders putting their thumb on this.  GIGOT:  Oh, I think you're wrong.  I think they can -- Democrats will try to do that.  But here's the question, James.  Would Bernie Sanders actually be a better candidate you think against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton?  TARANTO:  It's hard to say.  I mean, I still tend to think he's probably too left wing when people really think about it.  But he's a much more likable person than Mrs. Clinton is.  GIGOT:  He's more authentic.  TARANTO:  Yeah.  We talk about what a weak candidate she is -- she is turning out to be.  Well, you don't need these recent polls to tell you that.  She was a weak candidate in 2008 when she was inevitable and she lost to Barack Obama.  GIGOT:  Right.  TARANTO:  This year, they cleared the field of everyone except the fringe nobodies and --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Who became a fringe somebody.  TARANTO:  And one of these fringe nobodies became a somebody.  (LAUGHTER)You know, Sanders is a man who has won 10 times statewide, in an American state, running as an avowed Socialist.  Granted, it's Vermont, but still, that's quite an accomplishment.  He has something going for him as a politician.  GIGOT:  Kim, let's talk about the news story, a very good story in the ""Wall Street Journal,"" news site reported this week about a donation that the Clinton Global Initiative, which is a relative of the Clinton Foundation, made to a private for-profit company and which stretches the rules of what non-profits are supposed to do.  Tell us about that story.  STRASSEL:  Well, this is -- it's important to say they arranged it, so in this role, CGI acted as a matchmaker.  What they did is they get wealthy people who make commitments to good causes and then they help place that money with the good causes.  But, as you say, in this case, they had a wealthy individual step forward with money and they funneled that money to a for-profit company that is owned and operated and shares are held in by a bunch of Clinton cronies, a neighbor of theirs in Chappaqua, people who are high up in Democratic politics, who had helped out on Clinton campaigns, and, by the way, had made other donations themselves to the Clinton Foundation.  So it's the kind of classic Clinton sleaze that everyone is used to hearing about and it really puts people off.  And this is certainly not going to help Mrs. Clinton with all of those favorability and trust --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  The argument in the Clinton Foundation is saying this is just standard business.  We do this all the time, facilitating donations, but it's really -- is that right?  STRASSEL:  No, they facilitate donations between philanthropists and do- good organizations out there.  This is very different.  This was facilitating a wealthy individual who would underwrite a company owned by their friends.  And, by the way, if they thought there was nothing wrong with it, they wouldn't have scrubbed it from their website, which, by the way, they did, and they admitted they thought it might leave a kind of bad taste out there if people saw it.  GIGOT:  All right.  Thank you, Kim.When we come back, as the battle for campaign cash heats up, Donald Trump turns to the high-dollar donors he once attacked.  So can he compete with the Clinton fundraising machine?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  The race to raise campaign cash is heating up and Donald Trump is now courting the very same high-dollar donors he once attacked, facing what could be a $1.5 billion campaign against Hillary Clinton.  Trump said last week that he will not self-finance his general election run, and plans are reportedly in the works to kick off an aggressive schedule of fundraising beginning in Los Angeles at the end of the month.So, Kim, you wrote a very good column this week, very informative about Donald Trump's money issues.  So is it possible, could it be that this billionaire is actually cash poor for a general election run?  STRASSEL:  You have to ask that question.  I think there's a good argument that his decision not to release his tax filings, he says they're under audit but they're probably other reason.  One is that they probably contain a lot of very complicated tax maneuvers that might make him look like he's not paying the taxes everybody else does.  But the other issue is this question of how liquid wealthy he is.  No doubt, a lot of his money is tied up in real estate and investments.  Not something that's easily accessible.  He had a lawsuit back in 2006 in which a reporter ended up getting hold of his tax forms, made it sound like he isn't as flush as he possibly -- may not have been released.  They're under seal.  But the reporter suggested that one reason he might not want to release those things is because you would know then what his net income was.  GIGOT:  So, sign on former Goldman Sachs employee, Steve Mnuchin, to raise money.  But will the fundraisers come?  Some are coming around.  Sheldon Adelson, but others, like Paul Singer, said they're not going to give to Trump.  What do you think his prospects are?  HENNINGER:  I think they're doubtful at best.  Ken Langone gave an interview this week in which he said this was his last round in politics. I'm out of this after this.  I've had enough.  I've served my time in hell.  (LAUGHTER)Sheldon Adelson wrote a piece for ""The Washington Post"" in which he said, ""I disagree with Donald Trump on a lot of things but he has business experience and so I'm going to support him.""  Boon Pickens is holding what he calls a reception for Trump down in Texas.So this doesn't add up to a tremendous amount of enthusiasm.  But to get people to donate up to a billion dollars, you'll require a lot of donor enthusiasm.  It's not there yet.  GIGOT:  What does this say, James, about his decision to go to big-dollar donors about his argument earlier that fundraising is inherently corrupt? Apparently, not?  FREEMAN:  Yeah, he's moved on from that.  (LAUGHTER)I don't think it's going to hurt him because the comparison is Hillary Clinton.  (LAUGHTER)So I also think he's not going to have the money that she's going to have, but maybe, in this unconventional campaign, in an unconventional year, it's not going to matter, just like it hasn't mattered to this point.  And I think it has to do with maybe his ability to make a lot out of earned media or free media.  Now, I don't think now that he's running against Clinton the media is going to be as friendly to him.  GIGOT:  You don't think?  (LAUGHTER)FREEMAN:  They're not.  But there's a fundamental problem for Mrs. Clinton, even though she's going to have a lot of money.  He is good on TV.  She is not good on TV.  TARANTO:  Right.  And the media were not terribly friendly to Trump during the primary.  They just gave him a lot of air time.  And, you know, I suppose the media could start ignoring Trump now and hurt him, but I don't see that happening.  GIGOT:  What about the issue of his tax returns, OK?  We advised him early on, get them out.  You know, we said Republican voters would want to know if there's any potential vulnerabilities, like Kim suggested there could be.  Now, of course, Hillary Clinton's making an issue of it.  Mitt Romney is making an issue of it.  And will it hurt him, James?  TARANTO:  I don't know.  The question is, do voters care about this?  I don't know.  It has become a matter of -- it's become a political norm that presidential candidates show their tax returns.GIGOT:  Right.TARANTO:  It started with the Checkers speech where Richard Nixon called on Adlai Stevenson and his running mate to release their tax returns to show that they had nothing to hide.  Since then, it became a norm.  But I think it may be something that people in the media and good government-types care about more than --(CROSSTALK)HENNINGER:  And if so, why isn't he releasing the returns?  I mean, so he doesn't pay taxes in.  He's in real estate, and probably his charitable contributions are minimal.  I think James is right.  It's not that big a deal.  What else might be in them?  GIGOT:  But -- exactly.  The reason that he -- the Republicans should care about this and Donald Trump should care about this, if Democrats make this an issue, they'll invent things.  I mean, that's what Harry Reid said.  FREEMAN:  Right.GIGOT:  Mitt Romney just invents --(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN:  I don't think it's going to matter one way or the other because it's not 2012.  They had spent a year or two defining Mitt Romney as this evil, rich guy.  He wouldn't stand up for himself, wouldn't defend his business career.  Trump's appeal is different.  He reaches middle class people.  He reaches working class people.  I don't think they care about this issue.  And the comparison, again, to the Clintons.  GIGOT:  All right.  That's the fallback, the comparison to the Clintons.  We have to take one more break.  When we come back, our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Time now for our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.  Kim, start us off.  STRASSEL:  Ever since the server scandal broke for Hillary Clinton, her campaign team has been insisting and dismissing this as nothing more than a routine security inquiry.  So this is a hit to FBI Director James Comey, who this week stomped down that nonsense.  Asked about it, he said he was not familiar with the term ""security inquiry"" and said that all you needed to know about his organization was contained in its name, i.e., it was the federal bureau not of inquiry but of investigation.  Let's hope that he is as blunt with the findings as he is with terminology.  GIGOT:  All right.  James?  FREEMAN:  Paul, this is a hit to Chick-Fil-A for graciously opening its new New York location just a block from our office.  (LAUGHTER)We appreciate that.  And also a hit for defying our mayor here in New York, Bill de Blasio, who doesn't like the restaurant chain because its owners have political beliefs different from his own.  Terribly --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  On same-sex marriage.  FREEMAN:  That's right.  But the good news is we've heard New York values knocked a lot this year, but New Yorkers know a good chicken sandwich and they have been lining up.  HENNINGER:  And speaking of which, I'm giving a miss to the Food and Drug Administration, which has decided it will redefine the word ""healthy."" That's right.  You may not know it, but the Food and Drug Administration has the authority to decide whether you can put the word ""healthy"" on your food based on things like fat content.  Under the old definition, Frosted Flakes and Pop-Tarts qualify as healthy.  Avocados do not because they have too much fat.  I personally am going to continue to eat avocados, fat and all.  GIGOT:  All right.  Dan, thank you very much.And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us at JER on FNC.  That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" September 21, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters and she climbs ant hills for exercise, Dana Perino, ""The Five.""Last night, riots erupted after a pair of deadly shootings. My observations:It's impossible to know all the facts this fast, but in the world of ""social injustice,"" one can't afford to wait. After terror, our leaders say ""don't jump to conclusions,"" but not in these situations. Why is that?Fact is humans lump unique acts together, if it suits them. Meaning: No matter how different Tulsa was from Charlotte, it's easy to form a theme from both making it less complex and more black and white. Even if a police officer and victim is black.What drives each act, though, is compliance. Once that first step goes south in a traffic stop, it creates a cascade of actions that can go south, too.The Tulsa and Charlotte shootings are way different. But they all started in one place: Perceptions of noncompliance and reactions ramp up as part of training.Each time an officer -- black or white -- confronts someone, noncompliance triggers the training, the adrenaline, the fear, the unbending mind of law enforcement.Last, compliance doesn't just apply to cop work, but to life. Lately it seems we're abandoning any form of conflict resolution. We can't discuss this stuff, without retreating to specific sides. We've all been there in our unbending minds, where emotion transcends truth.And so violent protest seems less rare these days; as media and activists green light it as a replacement for reason, facts become annoying hurdles to action.I just want to play a clip of Chief Kerr Putney from Mecklenburg Police Department. He is describing yesterday's shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which is a far different shooting than Terence Crutcher, which is -- when you look that video, it's incredibly disturbing. But here is Chief Kerr Putney, talking about Keith Lamont Scott, the shooting of him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KERR PUTNEY, CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG POLICE CHIEF: He exited the vehicle armed with a handgun. The officers observed him get back into that vehicle at which time they approached the vehicle to engage the subject. The officers gave loud, clear, verbal commands which were also heard by many of the witnesses. They were instructing the subject once he got out of the vehicle to drop the weapon. In spite of the verbal commands, Mr. Scott, as I said, exited his vehicle armed with a handgun as the officers continued to yell at him to drop it. He stepped out posing a threat to the officers, and Officer Brently Vinson subsequently fired his weapon, striking the subject.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So Juan, when you hear about how that unfolded and how different it is from the Tulsa shooting where is, where the man is unarmed and it looks like it just looks really bad. It tells me that these things cannot be grouped together, because when you group these events together, you create a story line that leads to things like riots or like Dallas, unfortunate events that people were emotion drives them to wrong answers. Does that make sense?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Yeah. I think, you know, obviously compliance is key because I have said this to my sons, one of whom has a heavy foot on the gas pedal. You know, hey, when a cop stops you, you got to keep your hands in plain view, you got to be respectful. I've heard people on this network say, oh, you know, gosh. Why would you say such a thing about police? But let me tell you, if you are black, you say such a thing to your kids about police. So compliance is very real. Now the other side of this as we saw in the Tulsa shooting --GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: But we've also seen in Minneapolis this year. I believe it was Minneapolis .DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Yes.WILLIAMS: . where the guy was in the car and he says to the officer, ""I'm reaching for my wallet.""GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: I have a permit to carry a gun. And he still gets shot. And I think there's a lot of fear on half of people like myself that, you know what, you show up and it's, you know, let's say you had a couple drinks Greg. Let's say your medication is not right and a cop says, hey, you better do this and you are slow or you look a little stumbling and then suddenly .KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Disoriented. Yeah.WILLIAMS: . bam. You know, what did I do? You suddenly -- this is what the sister of the guy in Tulsa said.GUTFELD: Right --WILLIAMS: That brown skin, and especially if you are a male and if you are large, you know what, suddenly you are criminalized, just the sight of you is taken as significant threat to the officer. You are talking about .GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: . officers responding because they feel threatened. I'm very sensitive to that. I think I wouldn't want to be one of these officers. I praise God for having officers who do such a difficult job. But I'm saying, as a citizen, it hurts me that I have to fear for myself, my family, my children, when we deal with police.GUTFELD: Yeah. But the -- Kimberly, the idea of grouping these stories together as story like when you look at Tulsa, you can see how horrible that is. And you can that see perhaps there was, there were choices that shouldn't be made .GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: . obviously. But you look at this other one with Mr. Scott, he was armed. I mean, when we group these things together, we eliminate facts to create a story. And that to me is is dangerous.GUILFOYLE: And you eliminate meaningful discussion based on the unique factual circumstances of each situation. So you might have write then at the wrong narrative and it's grouped together, and people can easily misplace the facts from one and attribute it to the other story. There isn't the clarity, the focus and the learning moment that you might have to be able to talk to the people -- talk to the public, explain the circumstances without prejudging the other situation they were able. This is just a big problem. This is an epidemic in this country and here is, two more examples that they're very different in terms of the facts and how it played out and ultimately, the end conclusion.GUTFELD: Yeah. Jesse, this, this -- the other issue I find here is when they ascribe intent to the shootings, as though a police officer wakes up in the morning and decides, ""This is how I want to end my day.""JESSE WATTERS, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah.GUTFELD: It's not like terror where a person goes out, plants a bomb because he wants to kill people. The police officer, the black officer in North Carolina didn't wake up and say, ""This is -- I'm going to go out and shoot somebody.""WATTERS: Yeah, police save lives for a living. They don't take lives for a living. But let's look at the facts here, there's a narrative out there that police are just killing unarmed black people. Just in 2016, police killed 702 people. Only a hundred and sixty -three of them were black. That's only 23 percent. So that narrative is out the window. And if you look at the facts of this case, this guy Scott, he had a DUI conviction, he had an assault conviction. He was armed. He didn't obey commands. He was shot; a black man by a black police officers. But the nation of Islam comes in, in the scene and says, ""Black people in Charlotte need to now boycott all white businesses. That makes no sense. Then which contributes to the riots, the daughter of this victim .GUILFOYLE: OK.WATTERS: . comes now on Facebook live and say, ""He was just reading a book."" So that's one of those ""hands up, don't shoot"" narratives that's false. They recovered no book. And the thing goes viral and now people are rioting. Martin Luther King never rioted. He never looted. And that's one of the reasons he was so effective. So if black Americans have such a problem with police officers stereotyping them as criminals, the reaction shouldn't be to then, go commit criminal acts out in the street, loot and cause mayhem. It's not a great look.GUTFELD: You know Dana, if you control for compliance, 100 percent that the only error would be on the police. And so isn't that kind of, and you will always, afterwards, have that area investigated, at least that's what we are seeing now.PERINO: Well, in this heightened environment, police are going to be held to account or at least have to answer to things. But I think that's an improvement over past decades, Juan. But I was actually -- if I could ask Juan a question. I'm curious about the fact that it was a black police officer that was the officer that shot the man in North Carolina.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Does that change anything in terms of the thinking or the discussion or any of the online chatter that you hear?WILLIAMS: No --PERINO: Or is it about cops --WILLIAMS: It's about police.PERINO: It's not about white cops, it's about police.WILLIAMS: Yes, it's about, you know, it's about the thin blue line. I think Greg has pointed out on the show that, in fact, I think it's black and Latino officers are more likely .GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: . to fire quickly. And this officer was plainclothes, Dana. But even so, he was with officers who were in uniform. But the issue becomes not one of is it a black officer or a white officer, it's the idea that police are either fearful or quick to respond, use excessive force in dealing with black people or Latino people. But especially -- and I was thinking, this is an important distinction, poor people, people who are living often times dysfunctional, crazy neighborhoods where you do have a lot of the drugs, the gangs, kids were out of control is that, the question is, OK, sometimes you have bad behavior taking place. Is that, is that a license then for people who have the authority of law to use excessive force?GUTFELD: And it's also well -- and the police officer is, his job is to go into that environment. And if it is unstable environment, that adds, you know --WILLIAMS: It does.GUTFELD: An extra emotional, you know, conflict --WILLIAMS: Right. So the ""Washington Post"" has a statistic that speaks to what Jesse was talking about and said, 24 percent of the people who have been shot so far this year, fatally shot by police are black people.WATTERS: Right.WILLIAMS: Now black people are 13 percent of the population, similarly about, you know, when it comes to black men, about 6 percent of the population, it's 40 percent. It's unbelievable.WATTERS: But they are committing disproportionate amounts of the crime and they are having more interactions with police officers .WILLIAMS: Jesse. JesseWATTERS: . in the inner city.WILLIAMS: Jesse, listen. Let's talk about -- OK, how many black versus white doing drugs? Similar numbers Jesse.WATTERS: Listen, heroin is a big problem.WILLIAMS: I understand.WATTERS: Crack is a big problem.WILLIAMS: Yeah.WATTERS: It's infesting the inner cities.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: Where as people live in the inner cities, mostly blacks. So that's part of the problem.WILLIAMS: What?WATTERS: You are seeing a lot more densely populated regions infected with drug abuse and drug trafficking.WILLIAMS: Jesse, we have terrible drug problems in this country.WATTERS: They are concentrated in the urban are areas and that's where close contact with law enforcement takes place.WILLIAMS: I think we have terrible drug problems in this country in Appalachia, up in the, you know, OxyContin is a plague in this country.GUILFOYLE: OK.WILLIAMS: Heroin now, out in all kinds of areas. I'm just telling you, the concentration of law enforcement --WATTERS: OK, so the police are less racist in Appalachia?WILLIAMS: I don't --(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: I will leave that to you, Jesse.GUILFOYLE: Yeah --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah, I just think that we also want to be very careful. There's a lot of different statistics and things out there. One of the things we should be up in arms is about, that I'd like to see them talk about the communities and then churches, you know, throughout to this country is black on black crime in areas that suffer, you know, disproportionately, socio-economically. And you see they are struggling for jobs, they are struggling to have safe communities and clean streets. So, I want to be very careful to not just focus all of it on police officers, because we've also seen some incredible leadership coming out of the police departments .WATTERS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . in African-American a police chiefs, police superintendents coming forward, speaking, being part of the solution as well. And discussions like this, yes, are very helpful. And, you know, one loss of life in a situation like this is one too many.GUTFELD: Well, that's the thing -- that's the second part of this story is that it's so hard to talk about this.WILLIAMS: Oh.GUTFELD: You know, I was -- I listened to a podcast with Sam Harris and Hannibal Buress, talking about this. And they were talking about how hard it is to talk about this. It turned into an absolute brawl, a total fight. And with the conversation was about having a conversation. It's because we are too busy -- where everything is becoming team sport.PERINO: Can I make one last point?GUTFELD: Sure.PERINO: I know we got to go. In your monologue, you are talking about like grouping these two things together when actually the facts are separate. But I also think that let's put -- obviously, I'm not a black person, but if I could try to put myself in their shoes --WATTERS: Obviously.PERINO: So the other night, on Saturday, when we had terrorist attacks in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota, we immediately, as Americans, although, aha! You connect the dots because you think -- OK, well, this is obviously Islamic terrorism for being perpetrated against United States. So, when two events happen on the same day and there -- you basically start a brushfire with social media, it's understandable that people .GUTFELD: Exactly.PERINO: . group them together instead of waiting for the facts.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: Yeah, it's a natural human behavior .PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: . to seek --PERINO: To aggregate.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: It's an evolutionary (inaudible) --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And so it's hard to --GUTFELD: The patternsWILLIAMS: Yeah, but it's not the case that we have so few. I mean, it's just, it's constant.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: It's almost like a constant flow around the country. And so the specifics that you talk about may be real, the differences, even the malicious stuff about no hands up, which Jesse said was true. But this is just so constant, so regular, and not all of it is fatal, a lot it is just excessive force.GUTFELD: All right. We could end there. Ahead, Trump argues that black communities in the U.S. are in the worst shape they've ever been. How he says he can fix them, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Yesterday, Donald Trump made this declaration about black America.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We're going to rebuild our inner cities, because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Wow. So how would Donald Trump rebuild struggling communities? He was asked that question earlier at town hall with Sean Hannity.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We need jobs. We need jobs, desperately need jobs. So obviously, we need the schools, we need the education. We need all sorts of things, and especially the inner cities. The inner cities are -- I mean, can you say never, but certainly one of the worst stages ever in the history of the inner city. It's so unsafe where you walk down the street and you get shot or your child gets shot. So we're going to really fix the inner cities. We're going to spend a lot of time. The democrats have run them for a hundred years, mostly uninterrupted. I mean nobody else, (inaudible) uninterrupted, and you see what's happened.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: The full interview airs tonight on Sean Hannity show, 10:00 p.m. eastern. Don't miss it.GUTFELD: I hope they play the new ad.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Just kidding. I'm kidding, Sean, just a joke.WATTERS: What ad, joke.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Gee, OK.GUILFOYLE: Noticed the camera stayed on the wide shot.WILLIAMS: Holy molly.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But Gregory, on to more serious issues.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Gregory, the worst ever?GUTFELD: Yeah, it might, that might be a stretch. I mean, there are things in the past that are better off --WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUTFELD: . but they are worse. But he, but we are seeing spikes in violence, and roughly 20, 25 cities across the United States. Even as overall, violence goes down, we're still seeing these increases, but I mean -- yes, he has an interesting way of going back -- when he is saying what do you have to lose, he is saying -- he's initially saying you are not going to get anything new from Hillary. It's like watching an old ""Law & Order"" rerun. And he's, and he is guaranteeing that it's going to be different with me. It's going to be -- you say, peak behind door number three. It might actually work, because his numbers are going up with blacks.WILLIAMS: No, no.GUTFELD: I say --WILLIAMS: Why? They weren't up in an ""L.A. Times"" poll, it was --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: You know, like a tracking poll. But the ""Wall Street journal"" has him at 1 percent.WATTERS: But don't --GUTFELD: That hasn't it gone up to something like --WILLIAMS: Why not? It bumps up and then he said, ""I'm doing better,"" but I'm saying, he's gotten the average, anyway. Dana?PERINO: Well, part of this is not only that he might believe what he is saying and care about what he is saying, but he also wants to depress African-American turnout for Hillary Clinton .WILLIAMS: Correct.PERINO: . even if they don't come out to vote for him .GUILFOYLE: Mark (ph).PERINO: . having those few people that might, he might be able to pick off are good. There are, I think a couple things that are working in his favor that he could, actually talk more about this. One of them, in particular Juan, is something you will agree with, which is school choice.WILLIAMS: Absolutely.PERINO: And we know that the NAACP and that Hillary Clinton have said, ""No more on the school choice thing,"" that she's not for that. But we actually know that it works, we know that the evidence of that, just this year in New York City. The other thing is that the government really -- in order to improve people's lives, there's actually not much that the government can actually do. A thing that a president can do is to help us try to set conditions for economic growth, but people really need opportunity. The other thing that somebody like Donald Trump could do, working with the governors, in particular, and even the mayors is the overregulation of all things is for when you want to become a entrepreneur or if you want to become a plumber, if you want to become an interior decorator, if you want to braid hair, if you want -- all the regulations and the costs of entering into that is really bad. And the last thing I would say is, the -- as a conservative, what you would want is smaller government and we can rebuild the cities. One of the ways that you actually can work with communities is to support the faith-based communities, something that President Bush did. President Obama pulled back on that, but I think that that was money well spent in those communities.WILLIAMS: Well, that's an important point on school choice. I would think that you should also emphasize that it seems like Hillary Clinton was a supporter of school choice. Then when the unions got involved, and teachers unions .PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: ... they pushed her and she caved.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: I find that appalling. Anyway, Jesse, I want to see, what you see, though, from Donald Trump, he is doing some outreach now, but in fact, the lament about Donald Trump from the black community is he was exciting white nationalist, anger and grievance for most of this campaign. And now suddenly, he is paying attention to black people?WATTERS: It's funny how the democrats and the media always criticize republican candidates for president because they don't go politics for the black vote. And then the first time a republican comes along and politics for the black vote and the same media and democrats criticize that person. I think he is doing legit outreach. When I go to these neighborhoods, no one likes Hillary. The other reason they want Hillary in the White House is they want Bill back in the White House.WILLIAMS: (inaudible).WATTERS: Maybe they don't like Trump, but people say they are open to Trump. And you have to admit, Juan, blacks have suffered under President Obama's policies.WILLIAMS: I don't believe that.WATTERS: Crime is up in these inner cities, he said, Wages are down. Home ownership is down. Poverty is up. Food stamps are up. What do you have to lose? --WILLIAMS: Well, I think here's --WATTERS: You know what I mean?WILLIAMS: And you have to be --WATTERS: You have to roll the dice. That's what he is saying, let's roll it.WILLIAMS: That's what he is saying, but I'm saying to you, you have an opportunity to lose your progress. Here is a guy who is talking about Obama where he is, he's not really an American, trying to undercut the first black president --WATTERS: But Don King endorsed him.WILLIAMS: Yeah.WATTERS: So I think that's going to change the game.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: And I mean - well, anyway, my point to you is, he is playing footsie with David Duke, I mean with the white national --WATTERS: Wait a second. Wait a second, Juan --GUILFOYLE: All right.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: Reverend Wright was Obama's pastor for 30 years --WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah. That's the equivalent of --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Come on.WILLIAMS: OK. All right, all right, all right. Kimberly --GUILFOYLE: To be fair, I mean, he did disavow. So I mean, it's unfortunate, you can't control all your supporters. Look at some of the people that support me.GUTFELD: I know.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. So, but in this -- I'm kidding for all of you out there.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: You are fine. You are fine. We're good. We're good.WILLIAMS: We love them.GUILFOYLE: But you know, Trump, at least he is trying. And at least he is asking the question, and he is putting forth the narrative. It's like, just give me a moment. Why don't you ask yourself? What have the democrats, what the liberals done for you in your school, in your communities, for your jobs, for your families over the past 50 years? You have been loyal to them. You have trusted them. You have counted and, in fact, depended on them. Do you feel that you have been let down? If you do, please listen to me. Please give me a chance to do right by you. That's important.WILLIAMS: Can I suggest one question?GUILFOYLE: And at least, maybe other republicans coming forward will also follow suit.WILLIAMS: Right.GUILFOYLE: Because you haven't seen that kind of rhetoric and that questioning since, you know, basically 1964 --WILLIAMS: So very, very quick --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Oh, I think that's fair.WILLIAMS: Yeah, that's what I'm saying very quickly to you, if this was another republican, I might say, aha, Kimberly -- but when I hear Donald Trump, who had to settle a suit with the Justice Department because he was accused of discriminating against black and Latinos in housing here in New York, I think this guy? Is this guy really the one?GUILFOYLE: OK. Well, I mean, again, as a lawyer, that's an accusation --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I know he settled.GUILFOYLE: I -- sure. People settle things all the time, every day .WILLIAMS: All right.GUILFOYLE: . across this country. That's how the system works.WATTERS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Nevertheless --WATTERS: Settled.WILLIAMS: No.GUILFOYLE: Nevertheless, you know, you have, you should know the specific circumstances. I'm just talking about what the inroads he is trying to make and the fact that, yeah, maybe Washington -- ""The Wall Street Journal"" has it, but since - what is it? Since September 10, it's gone up to 19.6 percent, the traffic -- the tracking poll of African-Americans .WATTERS: That's (inaudible) time.GUILFOYLE: . from 3 percent. Yeah.WILLIAMS: And it's back then--GUILFOYLE: So who knows?WILLIAMS: It went back then.GUTFELD: But Juan --GUILFOYLE: Who knows?GUTFELD: Juan, everybody is making a big deal about Don King's endorsement, calling him a convicted murderer. He endorsed Obama twice.WILLIAMS: Is that right?GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Well, oh, gosh.GUILFOYLE: That's what --PERINO: They're all democrats.WILLIAMS: Yeah.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: That was a misunderstanding, too.PERINO: They were.GUILFOYLE: The unfortunate death was due to the frustration of the ghetto. That was his --WILLIAMS: All right. Make sure to catch Trump's town hall on Hannity tonight, 10:00 p.m. eastern.GUTFELD: I love you, Sean.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I love you, just kidding.WILLIAMS: Ahead, do you recognize either of these two men?GUILFOYLE: My gosh.WILLIAMS: The FBI is looking for them. They were seen walking off with the New York City bomber's backpack on Saturday night. How you can help them .WATTERS: That's right.WILLIAMS: . track them down, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: We are learning a lot more today about the terror suspect charged with Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey. His possible motive, his path to radicalization and what the feds knew about him, two years go years ago. But first, the FBI is asking for your help to find these two men seen on surveillance video, handling the second bomb that did not detonate in Manhattan. Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge has more. Catherine?CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, thank you, Dana. The FBI releasing new images from surveillance video that was captured Saturday night and they are seeking information on the two men who were seen taking a pressure cooker bomb out of the suitcase and leaving it on the street. As you mentioned, that is the device that did not explode. This new poster goes to the reporting Rahami may not have acted alone. And while the men are described today as witnesses, not suspects, and the suitcase as evidence, it does leave open the possibility that others were involved and seemed to undermine statement made at Monday's news conference that they got everyone and no cell is operating in New York and New Jersey. Meantime, Rahami, as you know was carrying a personal journal when he was shot and captured on Monday. Today, Fox News exclusively obtaining eight images from that notebook showing he was knee deep in jihadist propaganda when he allegedly planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey.The journal was badly damaged in the takedown, riddled with bullet holes and soaked in blood. But you can clearly see the references to Osama bin Laden, to the American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who is really the godfather of the digital jihad, as well as the Ft. Hood shooter, Nidal Hasan, who killed three and injured more than 30 others in the 2009 rampage at the Texas army base.What's striking is that this 13-page indictment released last night that lays out the federal charges talks about the notebook as well as the references to al Qaeda and the cleric, but there really is this glaring omission. While Rahami wrote about a terrorist called Adnani, who is a senior spokesman and leader of the Islamic State, there's absolutely nothing in the indictment about him, effectively whitewashing Rahami's ISIS sympathies.We have asked the U.S. attorney as well as the Justice Department to explain what seems a very significant discrepancy, Dana.PERINO: All right. Thank you so much, Catherine. We really appreciate it.HERRIDGE: You're welcome.PERINO: We should just keep you the whole time.GUILFOYLE: I know.PERINO: I want to take it around the table. Two things, Kimberly...GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: ... I wanted to ask you. One is the picture of the two men, the suspects, it reminded me of -- remember in Brussels when the airport bombs were let off, and they had the pictures of one or two guys? They were leaving. And ultimately, they helped try to track him down.The second thing is this question of the scrubbing of that information, the possible scrubbing of that. How important is that?GUILFOYLE: I think it's significant, because now, actually, we have, you know, proof to the contrary. So it really is a glaring omission. When you see that they have that -- again, an intel, information-rich source right there to say look at the journal, look at his writing, take him for his word. He was very specific. He held it with him to the end, to the death, I mean, riddled with bullets and blood on it. Unbelievable imagery there. It was incredible for FOX News to get that eight-page exclusive. It tells the truth.So then it begs the question: what is the administration, what is the Department of Justice doing? Why would they not include that information, which would only strengthen the facts in the indictment, you know, against him? And then as to the other two individuals, I mean, highly suspicious. You're going to believe their...PERINO: Who walks up and takes somebody's backpack from them? ""Oh, I think I'll pick up this backpack and move on.""GUILFOYLE: Someone complicit.PERINO: Right?GUTFELD: No. That happens in New York a lot. A lot of people -- a lot of people pick stuff up.You know what's interesting to me? Again, you have a current terrorist preoccupied with an earlier terrorist. And this is the same thing that goes with mass shooters. It lends itself to the theory that compounding infamy through repetitive coverage escalates terror. Jihadism is a contagion that is spread by attention. So it's not more about adding to the story of terror. It's about -- about going -- matching our story with their story.WILLIAMS: Can I -- can I interrupt to mock you?GUTFELD: Yes, sure.WILLIAMS: But didn't you -- didn't you go after John Kerry for saying this a few weeks ago?GUTFELD: Yes, I did. But I also -- I also said that -- I'm trying to remember what I said. But I also mocked him, as well.WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.GUTFELD: No, but it's about -- it is about -- it's a war of narratives in a way. But the problem is that over the last four decade, the left has destroyed our narrative. America is no longer an exceptional country so you can provide the narrative against ISIS.We're supposed to say, like, this is the greatest country ever. But we have academic -- we have the academia, we have the entertainment, we have the media telling us -- deconstructing our country as evil. So it's no longer a surprise that people sit during the national anthem.PERINO: Jesse, I wanted to ask you something, but you can say anything you want, since you're going last here. But hindsight is 20/20 in these investigations. But how can we improve our foresight? Because you had the father two years ago tell the FBI, ""My son stabbed my other son, and he's a terrorist,"" and then he went to Afghanistan, and he's not on a watch list.WATTERS: Yes, not only that, if you look at the last eight years, there have been a lot of domestic terrorist attacks. And they all contain similar components.You have suspicious travel.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WATTERS: This guy went to some crazy war zone in Pakistan.You have contact with law enforcement. This guy stabbed his own brother. His dad dropped the dime on him. The FBI never even interviewed him.You have radical online footprints. This guy had his own YouTube channel looking at crazy videos. He was buying shrapnel off of eBay.WILLIAMS: I want to get to that point.WATTERS: So why can't the national security officials in this country loosen these things -- crack down on these things so these things don't happen again? Wake up, guys.WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I was struck by that. That he's on eBay buying the ingredients for a bomb. First of all, I didn't know you could do such a thing. But if you are, why isn't someone paying attention?PERINO: I think we will find out that they were, something else happened. Hindsight is 20/20. But perhaps...GUILFOYLE: And also, you have resources that you brought up and raised on this show yesterday to say maybe this is really a call to say we need more -- additional resources to combat this so that you can tie these threads together and connect it.PERINO: If I were a candidate debating on Monday night, I'd bring that up. But who am I?All right. Coming up, the Obama administration inadvertently makes the case for why America should not take in more refugees if we can't properly vet them. It happened right here on FOX News this morning. So stay tuned for that, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Yesterday, President Obama announced the U.S. will take in 110,000 more refugees in the coming year, despite the threat that terrorists could slip in with them. The State Department even concedes it's a possibility.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KIRBY, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: I would tell you that, you know, more than 10,000 Syrian refugees that we've admitted into the country by this month have all been extremely and very stridently vetted. In fact, Syrian refugees...BRIAN KILMEADE, CO-HOST, ""FOX & FRIENDS"": By whom?KIRBY: By the home interagency, DHS. Intelligence...KILMEADE: We don't have the paperwork, Admiral. You know that.KIRBY: They are going through a very serious interagency vetting process. The most that any refugee goes through. Is it perfect? Can it be perfect? Can it be foolproof? Well, probably not, no. But it is very, very serious.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Spokesman John Kirby also acknowledged this morning on FOX News that ISIS has already infiltrated refugee camps overseas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KIRBY: I wouldn't debate the fact that there's the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert themselves -- and we see that -- in some of the refugee camps in Jordan and in Turkey where they try to insert themselves into the population.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. And just a little note here. Dana, we have invited John Kirby to join us on ""The Five,"" and we will sit here until he comes. So get comfortable.PERINO: OK, I'll be here. I'd love to see him. Because I love that -- obviously, that job is an incredible one. And he's refreshingly honest.GUILFOYLE: He is.PERINO: This is true. This actually could happen.What I find interesting is that on Monday, I was reading -- or I think it was Tuesday -- The Financial Times. I knew you would love that.GUILFOYLE: Wonk (UNINTELLIGIBLE).WATTERS: Wonk, wonk.PERINO: The front-page headline story is about Angela Merkel saying to her country, ""I messed up. I let in way too many refugees. We weren't ready for this. And if I had to go back and do it over again, I would have changed things."" So if she's saying that in the face of having -- for bad politics for her but also just bad policy, then it would stand to reason that we might actually want to rethink things, as well. I'm not saying not to allow in refugees. But the process has to be more iron-tight.The other thing is, John Kirby points out eight out of ten of the refugees are women and children. Well, that's good. OK, fine. The thing about having men come along with them -- their families, their husbands, their fathers -- is that you need help in providing for these people. So somebody has to work in order to make all of this assimilation actually work out.So I have lots of other things, but I will...WILLIAMS: But I would say to you...PERINO: I will give you the talking stick.WILLIAMS: I would say to you, Ms. Perino, that in fact, when you look at Angela Merkel and Germany, they let in millions. We have let in -- I don't even think we've let in 10,000.PERINO: I know. But here's the other thing. Why don't you try to solve this problem at its source? That's...WILLIAMS: That's a good argument. But I'm saying it's also an argument for human understanding of people who find themselves suffering devastation. So when Donald Trump Jr. talks about Skittles...GUTFELD: Glad you brought that up.WILLIAMS: I mean, these are human beings.GUTFELD: OK, this is -- I love this. May I? May I?WATTERS: Go ahead.GUTFELD: This is the first time in history...GUILFOYLE: Mother may I, please.GUTFELD: ... where intellectuals don't understand metaphors. Everybody understands a metaphor: a few bad apples. Your mother used to say, ""There's always a few bad apples.""PERINO: In the bunch.GUTFELD: How dare you compare people to apples? That's the point of a metaphor.By the way, the left has used the Skittles metaphor and the M&Ms metaphor when talking about the police. Oh, a few bad cops. Or gun owners, a few bad gun owners, or college students. A few of those college students, they're assaulters (ph).So the idea of, like, the Skittles metaphor somehow being inhuman. No, it's simply an analogy.The other point about this that drives me nuts, the left chastises the right for denying progress when it comes to science, for ignoring change, adhering to our arcane beliefs. Well, the world has changed. The world has changed. Jihadist has changed the battlefield. The globe is the battlefield.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: Jihadists changed the world. So why is the left being so regressive? Why is the left actually adapting to the change in this world and admitting that change has to happen and that we cannot think the same way anymore?GUILFOYLE: OK, also...GUTFELD: Sorry.GUILFOYLE: I ought to call on myself.PERINO: Go for it.GUILFOYLE: I just don't find it to be so humanitarian if you're not, in fact, adhering to a proper and fair vetting process. And we already know from intelligence reports that the vetting process in Syria is compromised. And you would expect it, because that is a war zone, and it's very difficult.But let's get a little bit of elevation on this and say what else can we do to help rebuild communities there, to help restore jobs and communities over there so people don't have to be displaced, so they don't have to be uprooted from their country?And you see some other countries now saying, ""Guess what? We're going to throttle back on this a little bit, and we're going to try and provide aid over there, because maybe that's another way to look at the problem.""Because it does take time to be able to do the vetting. And the answer isn't, like, who looks like the better guy on the block, you know, Germany or the U.S. by sheer numbers? That's not a fair analysis.GUTFELD: But here's the problem. We are -- we are constantly yelled at for, quote, nation building. If we ever try to help anybody, we've got -- oh, that's nation building. So when all the refugees come here, they were chided for trying to build our own nation.WATTERS: Hillary also has her fingerprints all over the refugee crisis. It was boiled over on her watch and Obama's watch. She left Iraq. She pushed the Arab Spring.WILLIAMS: Oh, boy.WATTERS: Now they have nowhere to go. So she says, ""Oh, come here,"" because she feels responsible. But why should we have to play Russian roulette to soothe her guilty conscience?WILLIAMS: Wow. This is awful.WATTERS: The State Department is running the program.WILLIAMS: My God.WATTERS: These are the same people that lost...WILLIAMS: They say -- that's two years. You just heard...WATTERS: ... track of $6 million...WILLIAMS: Here we go.WATTERS: ... that couldn't protect an embassy on 9/11.WILLIAMS: I see, OK.WATTERS: Got suckered by the Iranians. I don't trust these people, you know. Let them live at your house, Juan.WILLIAMS: Fine. Listen, I'm telling you, they live in our community. This is like saying, ""Not in my neighborhood"" to people who are disabled or mentally ill or drug addicts.WATTERS: Yes, you know what? Send them to the Upper West Side. Send them to Georgetown. Send them to Martha's Vineyard.WILLIAMS: I'm telling you, and especially on the Skittles thing, nobody says that, because there are a few bad cops, there shouldn't be cops.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: It's that what we're talking about are human beings in crisis situations. Dana and Kimberly make a point about we can do more on the ground. But it's not to say that this great country should shut its doors.GUTFELD: No.GUILFOYLE: No one is saying to do that.GUTFELD: Not at all.WATTERS: We just don't trust the government to vet them.GUILFOYLE: Let's do it the right way.GUTFELD: Skittles are a metaphor. We aren't really calling them candy.GUILFOYLE: And I want to stand up for green M&Ms, who always are disparaged.But Dana, I think you made a great point about providing -- they have to be able to have communities here, and their husbands have to be able to work.PERINO: And also, here's the other thing. When you are a refugee, what you want as a refugee, you want to go home.GUTFELD: You want to be safe.PERINO: What we're assuming here is that they're going to come here. But why do we assume that now? Because the average length of a refugee's stay overseas wherever they go is -- 30 years ago, it was nine years. Now it's 26 years. That's an entire generation, which is how you get Rahami here at 7 years old, and then 21 years later, he becomes radicalized.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: I mean, that -- it's so much more complicated than.GUILFOYLE: And how are we going to pay for it all? You're not doing anybody a favor...PERINO: Are we willing to pay for it?GUILFOYLE: ... by bringing them over here and go like this, ""Mm, good luck.""All right, fine. Let's buy another commercial to pay for all this talk. How does one prepare to debate one of the most unpredictable presidential candidates in history? Hillary Clinton's team spilled some of her strategy today. You're going to hear it again. It's a secret.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: The first debate between Clinton and Trump is now five days away. We're getting some insight into how Hillary is prepping for the showdown. Her spokeswoman said today she's strategizing to face two different kinds of Trumps.GUILFOYLE: My goodness.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENNIFER PALMIERI, CLINTON'S COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: He can come on with a relatively -- relatively genteel persona that is calm. Or he could come in very aggressive and, you know, be aggressive in a way that you would not normally see a presidential, you know, Republican nominee behave. And so we're preparing for either -- for either one.And what's interesting is we're not necessarily finding that what she does changes much. But you just want to game it out.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So it sounds like Hillary has got her work cut out for her. She's got to prepare to face two different people.Kimberly, if Hillary starts coughing and she has a coughing fit...GUILFOYLE: Yes.WATTERS: ... what does Trump do?PERINO: Pat her on the back.GUILFOYLE: ""Cough drop, my dear.""WATTERS: Just a nice little...GUILFOYLE: Be a gentleman. Let's take a moment. Or ""Would you like some water or a cough drop, a Luden's perhaps? A Ricola? Something.""WATTERS: OK.GUILFOYLE: But be nice.WATTERS: So just play it cool? Don't step on it?GUILFOYLE: No.PERINO: And then wink at the camera.GUTFELD: And then say, ""You've got a phlegm.""WATTERS: Good one, Gutfeld.I think Juan is actually very concerned about this debate, because you have a big TV personality.WILLIAMS: Yes.WATTERS: He is loose. He's going in pretty fresh. He's a rookie. He is very funny. He's witty. He's got sharp elbows.GUILFOYLE: Man crush.WATTERS: And you have Hillary, who's programmed like a robot. She's been over-prepping. Do you think that she's going to get up there and freeze up, and Trump is just going to have this kind of winning personality?GUILFOYLE: He's not going to say yes to that.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: ... to the American people?WILLIAMS: Of course, you know, like for instance, Lester Holt, that famous Democrat -- ""Oh, my gosh, he's a Republican. I didn't know."" And then secondly, everybody...WATTERS: Working the moderator.WILLIAMS: Yes. He's a bully, and he's going to be bullying with the first woman to appear on this presidential stage. He's going to be one on one, not one on 16.WATTERS: They're playing the gender card already.WILLIAMS: No, I'm just saying you know what? For all of us, we're going to say if he doesn't stumble, if he doesn't say something stupid, outrageous, offensive, well, he wasn't bad.WATTERS: Yes, so the expectation game going in now, Trump is considered, basically, one comment away from blowing his whole campaign up. If you go in there with these low expectations, what kind of level of performance does he need to hit in order to say, Trump didn't lose. ""Oh, maybe Trump won""?PERINO: I think we might be putting too much emphasis on this first debate. It's an important one. I think they both have low expectations, because nobody knows what they're going to end up with.They could get 100 million viewers.WILLIAMS: yes.PERINO: That's a big deal. And also, if you want to learn more about what I think about it and Chris Stirewalt, we just recorded our podcast this afternoon.GUILFOYLE: Wow.PERINO: The whole thing is about the debate, and he talks about the contest versus polls, and we talk about pre-debate meals and what you would eat.WATTERS: Greg...GUTFELD: Wait, I thought the debate wasn't important.PERINO: Well, we have a podcast.GUTFELD: OK. You know what I think? The person who...WATTERS: Quickly, Greg.GUTFELD: The person who snaps first loses. And I think that Hillary, for practice, for the stand-in for Trump, they should have had Joe Pesci playing Tommy DeVito from ""Goodfellas."" That would have been the best stand-in.PERINO: Driving him...(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: All right. ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Time for ""One More Thing"" -- Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Well, today I'm remembering a beautiful soul and dear friend who recently passed away. My 81-year-old neighbor, Leslie Akin, born in 1935 in Brooklyn, New York. He was a beloved father of Chris and Doug, who are twins; Jill and David; and a grandfather of four. And a wonderful husband for 42 years to his beautiful wife, Wendy.Leslie will be remembered for his amazing sense of humor and glass-is-half- full outlook on life.His life was taken by CLL, Richter's transformation, and we can honor his legacy by fighting cancer. And I have more information on my Facebook page.Leslie, my friend, you will be missed by many, and you will truly never be forgotten.GUTFELD: Very nice. Dana.PERINO: All right. You might not know that today is the International Day of Peace. This is called for by the U.N. secretary-general. It's September 21. American University had a great event. It's called hashtag #WagePeace. And this is happening in America, of course, where there's a lot of peace.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Not so much around the world. But they had a really good event, and a lot of kids came out. And I wish them well.GUTFELD: Peace.PERINO: Out.GUTFELD: Out. All right.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I hate these people!(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Speaking of peace, there's a petition to get In and Out Burger to have a veggie burger. Forget who would even go to a burger joint for a vegetarian meal. That's stupid.PERINO: I would.GUTFELD: But I hate people who file petitions because they want something. ""Oh, I want something. Let's file a petition."" You know what? If you want something, go find it. All right.Juan.WILLIAMS: All right. Take a look at this reaction from Texas Rangers...GUILFOYLE: Are you well?WILLIAMS: ... third baseman Adrian Beltre. What caused that was an amazing behind-the-back catch by Rangers pitcher Nick Martinez. Martinez threw to first for the double play, as you see, leaving the batter, Andrelton Simmons, and Angels manager Mike Scioscia very annoyed, considering the Angels not only lost the game but they're still in last place...PERINO: I want that as a GIF.WILLIAMS: ... even with Mike Trout.GUTFELD: Jesse.WATTERS: OK. So this weekend at 8 p.m., we have a live ""Watters' World"" on Saturday night.PERINO: Oh, boy.WATTERS: Anything is possible.PERINO: Oh, boy.WATTERS: Also, tomorrow night on ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" we have a ""Watters' World"" where I go to a Hillary Clinton rally. Here's a picture I took there.GUTFELD: Terrible.WATTERS: It was a barn burner, as you can tell. People passing out, sleeping in the hallway of the event. And there will be more where that came from tomorrow night on ""The Factor.""GUILFOYLE: We're also live, too, Saturday.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Have fun.GUTFELD: And then I've got a show at 10 p.m. We're all -- we all have shows on.GUILFOYLE: And then Dana, you're live Sunday at 5. I'll tell you what.PERINO: I'll tell you what. And I'll be on ""FOX & Friends,"" an America's going to like something...GUTFELD: I will be...PERINO: It's going to be an awesome weekend.GUTFELD: I will be drinking somewhere tonight, I think. Probably downtown.GUILFOYLE: In your sippy cup? Your sippy cup?GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: I love it when we run out of things to talk about.GUTFELD: I won't tweet. They're telling me not to tweet.That's it for us. ""Special Report"" is next. Why?GUILFOYLE: Why?Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, FOX NEWS HOST:  This week on the ""Journal: Editorial Report,"" the fight is on as the so-called establishment Republicans battle it out in New Hampshire.  So is likely to emerge as the alternative to Cruz and Trump.  Plus, the Saudi execution of a Shiite cleric throws the Middle East deeper into turmoil.  Will the U.S. stand by its ally.And global markets kick off the year with a plunge and it's time for slowing growth.  Is a recession on the horizon?  We'll find out after these headlines.GIGOT:  Welcome to the ""Journal: Editorial Report.""  I'm Paul Gigot.Well, the fight is on as the Republican presidential candidates scramble to shore up support in two early voting states.  While Ted Cruz and Donald Trump battle for the top spot in Iowa, the so-called establishment candidates are locked in an increasingly nasty showdown in New Hampshire with a PAC supporting Marco Rubio hitting the air waves with an attack on New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER:  Chris Christie could well be Obama's favorite Republican governor.  Why?  His record.  He instituted an Internet sales tax, supported Common Core and liberal energy policies.  Incredibly Christie backed Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.  Chris Christie, one high-tax, Common Core, liberal energy-loving, Obamacare/Medicaid expanding president is enough.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; editorial board member, Joe Rago; and assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman.  So, James, why is Christie suddenly the focus of these attacks?  Not just from Marco Rubio but Bush and Kasich, too.  JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  I think they all recognize he's the threat.  The short answer is Christie is good at politics.  He's great at making the case, great at town halls.  New Hampshire likes retail politics.  As you have seen this election turn a little bit more to terrorism, national security, he does have the post 9/11 law enforcement background.  GIGOT:  Is this a critique of him as a liberal really plausible -- he governed with a Democratic legislature but he's not a liberal.  FREEMAN:  Watching that reminds me of all the things that ticked me off about Christie.  (LAUGHTER)As a New Jersey constituent we have not seen the conservative reform we hoped for.  You have a Democratic legislator he can't do much about.  He held the line.  Where do you set the bar on his performance?  Given what he's dealing with it's hard to say he's governed as a liberal in New Jersey.  GIGOT:  Joe, you were up in New Hampshire.  You followed Christie.  What did you learn?  JOE RAGO, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  I think James put his finger on it.  He has so much charisma and raw political talent.  He's connecting with New Hampshire voters.  He's all about the first-in-the-nation primary, the participatory tradition --  GIGOT:  He handles question after question for two hours.  RAGO:  Sure.  Saw him at a town hall in Rochester at a hotel.  He's just so fluid.  He's so smooth.  And one thing that's remarkable that he's done in New Hampshire is he's improved his favorability ratings, which almost never happens in American politics.  He was liked in March by about 40 percent of voters, now 65 percent.  He's only a point behind Donald Trump.  He's the highest in the field except for Trump.  GIGOT:  Let's look at the response ad to the Marco Rubio attack.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Do not be fooled.  Any significant division within the Republican Party leads to the same awful result, Hillary Rodham Clinton in January of 2017 taking the oath of office as president of the United States.  This country cannot afford that outcome.  We Republicans have a duty, I believe, a profound moral duty, to work together.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Dan, he dodges all the points about the issues and goes at the question of Republican unity.  Effective response?  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR:  Very effective.  That was the high road.  Chris Christie is capable of running along the low road.  He's also said Marco Rubio has been spoon fed every one of his political victories.  Totally false, the victory over Charlie Crist was an outsider's victory.  All of the candidates decided that positive wasn't working in the environment of Donald Trump.  Now they are all going negative.  Jeb Bush is attacking Christie.  Christie attacking Jeb Bush.  Marco Rubio in the center of it.  Negative works in campaigns, but does it turn off voters in the long run?GIGOT:  That's the question I want to ask you about Rubio, James.  He's campaigned as Mr. Sunshine, Mr. Optimism, Mr. American Dream.  Here you have the attack ad that's really down and dirty.  Does that have a potential to rub off in a negative way on Rubio?  FREEMAN:  He has a problem.  Christie has gone from nowhere to somewhere in a short period of time.  He's looking for a way to respond.  Rubio has not been able to break out of the pack in terms of the establishment primary.  I think he's got a problem maybe in the New Hampshire environment especially.  Unlike a Christie who can go on for hours and inform and entertain you, the Rubio presentation seems more superficial.  My impression is you can exhaust the policy discussion pretty quickly.  GIGOT:  Joe, whoever breaks out of New Hampshire as the alternative to Trump or Cruz who look to finish 1-2 in Iowa, they may be the main alternative to those two.  RAGO:  They are counting on the race consolidating the real danger in New Hampshire is you get an inconclusive result where maybe Jeb Bush gets 10 percent, Christie gets 10 percent, Rubio gets 10 percent.  It really doesn't tell you anything.  You just have Trump and Cruz on the rise with no alternative.  GIGOT:  Trump and Cruz, Dan.  Let me ask you about the Trump attack on Cruz's Canadian birth.  His mother was an American citizen at the time.  There is a debate over whether he's eligible for the presidency.  I think he is.  HENNINGER:  Mm-hmm.  GIGOT:  But Trump is feeding that birther narrative.  Going to work?  HENNINGER:  Donald Trump has a gift for finding the Achilles heel in these candidates.  I think for Ted Cruz he sometimes seems too eager for the nomination.  Look.  If he wins in Iowa, I think Donald Trump will start, if I may say so, carpet bombing Cruz.  GIGOT:  If Cruz wins, you mean?  HENNINGER:  If Cruz wins in Iowa, Trump will unload on him and put doubt in people's mind about whether he's viable.  GIGOT:  Thank you all.  When we come back, the Saudi execution of a Shiite cleric throw it is Middle East deeper into turmoil.  A look at the American response so far and the risk if the Saudi regime falls.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Saudi Arabia has severed diplomatic ties to Tehran after the embassy there was set on fire last weekend by protester.  The demonstrations were sparked by the Saudi execution of a prominent Shiite cleric and mark a dangerous turn in the long simmering Sunni/Shiite tensions in the Middle East.  We are back with Dan Henninger.  And Wall Street Journal columnists, Mary Anastasia O'Grady and Bret Stephens, are also here.  So, Bret, how dangerous is this turn in the Middle East?  BRET STEPHENS, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST:  I think what you are seeing now could be the beginning of a sectarian conflict we have been experiencing in Syria for the past four years.  GIGOT:  Writ large across the Middle East?  STEPHENS:  You are talking about the Sunni super power, Saudi Arabia, and the Shiite super power, Iran.  Clearly, the Cold War is becoming a hot war.   There is a proxy war already in Yemen.  There were allegations that is the Saudis targeted and bombed or attempted to bomb the Iranian embassy in the capital of Yemen.  Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar all joining Saudi Arabia in severing ties with Iran.  This could turn hot.  Be mindful, there could be nuclear proliferation involved as well.  GIGOT:  Russia and Iran, Mary, have an interest in higher oil prices.  The Saudis keeping with strong oil production have been keeping prices down.  They have an interest, the Russians, in Iran in fomenting turmoil in Saudi Arabia.  MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, COLUMNIST:  As Bret says, we already have proxy wars going on in the Middle East.  Not just Yemen but Syria is a proxy war.  I think the problem, the big problem in the Middle East now is the U.S. is absent.  The U.S. used to be very clearly a force for stability in the region.  Now Saudi Arabia knows the U.S. is really not there, doesn't have it back.  That's introducing a lot of instability.  GIGOT:  They say we can't rely on the United States.  They threw over Mubarak in Egypt, a longtime ally.  We can't trust them.  They are tilting toward Iran.  This is going to get worse before it gets better.  O'GRADY:  Exactly.  That's why, as Bret says, this will get worse before it gets better.GIGOT:  What about those who say, look, ""we don't have a dog in this fight,"" to quote Ted Cruz.  Shiite, Sunnis kill each other.  Who cares?  Doesn't matter.  Let them do it.  Let the Saudis fall.  HENNINGER:  This is really quite crazy thinking.  It is a consequence of what Mary is suggesting Obama basically pulling out of the Middle East.  The idea that we should let Saudi Arabia go.  If we abandoned Saudi Arabia, what is Egypt, Turkey and Jordan supposed to think.  They will rightly conclude we were abandoning them, too.  The idea the United States can pull out of what's going on in the Middle East completely is delusional.  GIGOT:  What is the strategic dangers, Bret, is the Saudis were to fall?  I'm not saying it's imminent, but it's not out of the question.  STEPHENS:  Saudi Arabia doesn't go away or the Saudis don't go away.  GIGOT:  The oil fields.  STEPHENS:  The oil fields don't go away.  Radicalism or radicals in Saudi Arabia don't go away.  There could be a situation that resembles Syria.  There is a large minority population in Saudi Arabia.  You could get governments more radical or certainly more anti-American than the one that we have now, which is at least pro American.  Look, there is a lot to dislike about Saudi Arabia the way it conducts its government.  There was a lot to dislike about the shah of Iran.  That should be an object lesson that just because you don't like your pro American autocrats, should be a recipe for distancing yourself with them because what comes next could be a great deal worse.  You already have one radical Islam mist enemy, Iran.  We don't need another one.  GIGOT:  Mary, let's turn to North Korea exploded its fourth nuclear test, third under President Obama's administration this week.  That threat, the nuclear threat from North Korea is growing beyond North Asia now.  They are developing the means to deliver a weapon, to even hit the U.S. mainland.  O'GRADY:  Again, a big failure of the Obama administration to be present in Asia.  You remember the Asia pivot sounds like a long time ago.  One of the major problems in Asia now is that China is really not in the interest of China to see North Korea doing this.  On the other hand, China thinks they like North Korea as the thorn in the side of the U.S.  So U.S.-Chinese relations are important.  I think the Obama administration has failed to bring China on board with the idea of containing North Korea.  STEPHENS:  Don't forget North Korea and Iran cooperated quickly on missile technology and, by some reports, also on nuclear technology.  No one should be surprised if Pyongyang is sharing the results of its tests with Tehran.  GIGOT:  One of the legacies will be greater nuclear proliferation rather than the end of the nuclear era, as President Obama said he hoped for.  All right, when we come back, stocks take a New Year tumble amid signs of economic slowdown.  So were our 2016 recession fears on target or overblown?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Markets around the world kicked off the New Year with a plunge this week, after a sell-off in Chinese stocks renewed fears about the strength of the world economy.  Signs here at home of an economic slowdown as well with the Atlanta Federal Reserve cutting its forecast for fourth-quarter growth nearly in half, to just 0.7 percent.  We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary O'Grady and James Freeman.  So, Mary, China behind -- is one of the factors behind this sell-off is fears of a slowdown.  Anything else, or is that it?  O'GRADY:  You know, Paul, for years, we've been saying that the Fed's insistence on pumping out free credit was going to create misallocation of capital around the world and I think what's adding to the China problem is the end of the oil boom in the U.S.  I mean, you have a lot of small, medium and even larger oil companies having a lot of financial trouble, some of them going bust.  Now, this is going to bleed in to banks and credit and lending and, you know, if there's a retrenchment there, that's going to affect the U.S. economy.  We're also in earnings season now.  The expectations for earnings that are coming up are that they're going to be disappointing.  The market goes up and down based on earnings.  If they're not there, there's going to be a lot disappointment.  GIGOT:  Friday, jobs numbers, Dan, good, 295,000 new jobs in December.  Now, job growth can be a lagging indicator.  And if the fourth quarter is as slow as people say, you might not get that carryover into the New Year.  But are we potentially look at a recession in this election year?  HENNINGER:  Well, I think, yeah, we are potentially looking at a recession or something close to it.  If we get very weak growth between zero and 1 percent effectively it would be a recession.  I'd like to introduce a political issue here, which is that that would be very bad for Hillary Clinton, as the one who's running more or less as the successor to the incumbent.  Remember in 1992, George H.W. Bush running against Bill Clinton.  Clinton accused him of presiding over a recession.  It had ended at that point, but it killed him.  I think the same thing could happen to Hillary Clinton if the economy is very weak this year.  GIGOT:  James, the Republicans haven't talked about the economy at all.  You can listen to these debates and there's the occasional mention of tax reform.  Other than that, it seems to be a nonissue.  They're talking about so many other things.  FREEMAN:  What they're saying about tax reform is great.  They're just not saying it loud enough or often enough.  So I think, as the campaign goes along it, they may focus more on that.  Last week, I predicted this would be the year we start to rally --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  You are Mr. Optimism.(CROSSTALK)  GIGOT:  Have you covered your long with your shorts now?  (LAUGHTER)FREEMAN:  I said people were going to anticipate the end of the Obama era.  I didn't say it was going to happen in the first week of the year.  This was obviously the roughest week in equity markets.  But Donald Luskin (ph) noted in our paper that the 70 percent of oil prices over the last year represents $2.9 trillion of savings to consumers worldwide.  This is enormous.  You couple this with people seeing the end of the Obama era and, eventually, we're going to get more discussion about tax reform in the Republican primary.  I think those animal spirits, that optimism starts coming back.  GIGOT:  Mary, oil and gas has been maybe the strongest part of the U.S. economy under this administration, during the Obama era.  To be suddenly laying off tens of thousands of jobs by necessity because of oil prices is going to take a big bite out of growth.  O'GRADY:  For sure.  Also, I would just say that I think we are seeing candidates talking about the dissatisfaction of the public in the economy, but they're blaming it on immigrants and they're saying they're going to fix the problem by kicking all these people out of the question.  People are worried and they're responding by responding to this demagoguery against immigrants.  If you look at the savings, it's not being spent.  Why isn't it being spent?  Because Milton Freeman, as explained to us, has something called the permanent income theory.  That means, if people see an increase in the money they have available, if they think it's permanent to them, they will spend it.  But if they think it's transitory, they're going to save it.  And I think most people are so worried about the economy that they're not going to spend that oil dividend.  GIGOT:  All right, Mary, thank you.  We have to take one more break.  When we come back, ""Hits & Misses"" of the week.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Time now for our ""Hits & Misses"" of the week -- Mr. Freeman?FREEMAN:  This is a hit, Paul, to the taxpayers who revolted when the IRS wanted to collect still more data about people who donate to charitable foundations.  This was rightly seen as laying the groundwork to make it easier to abuse conservatives next time.  Also a hit to Congressman Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who helped lead the rebellion.  He's almost as good a politician as he was an NCAA wrestler.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  Spoken by a wrestler.  RAGO:  Paul, another hit to Republicans in Congress this week who sent a bill repealing Obamacare to the president's desk for the first time.  Of course, he'll veto it, but Democratic obstruction in the Senate usually blocks even that this is an important moment.  That shows the new entitlement is only an election away from extinction and sets up an important contrast with Hillary Clinton in 2016.  GIGOT:  If the candidate makes it, he's willing to make the case.RAGO:  That's right.GIGOT:  Dan?  HENNINGER:  Well, Paul, a hit in the current circus-like presidential atmosphere that we're in to Gary Johnson who has thrown his hat in the ring.  You might say, who he?  Gary Johnson is the former governor of New Mexico.  He has given up his job as the CEO of a marijuana company, I kid you not, to run as the Libertarian candidate, because he thinks Rand Paul isn't sufficiently Libertarian.  I don't know if he's gotten in soon enough to get in the undercard Thursday night, but watch Gary Johnson.  GIGOT:  Thinks the marijuana votes will carry him to victory, OK.  (CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Maybe in Colorado.And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us @jeronfnc.  That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you all right here next week.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
