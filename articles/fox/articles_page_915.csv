This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight with a third Republican debate upon us. We have new polling tonight on a changing republican field.Plus, new questions about leadership, immigration and about Hillary Clinton in a special look at the 2016 race for the White House.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. We begin tonight with polls just out that used a different approach to judge the 2016 race. Measuring the voters' opinions on the Republican candidates rather than specifically just asking who they would vote for. Tell us what you think of them this poll tried to get at.And Dr. Ben Carson who is second to Trump in the RealClearPolitics.com average of polls, those that asked who Republicans would vote for, takes the number one spot easily when it comes to likability. Head and shoulders above his next competitor, Senator Marco Rubio and a mile ahead of Donald Trump. That is just the latest in the series of polls that had Dr. Carson ahead of Trump. A change that has Trump telling voters to take action.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Will you get your numbers up, please? So, by the way, before I forget, will you get the numbers up, Iowa, please. This is ridiculous. What the hell are you people doing to me? Please, do me a favor? Let me win Iowa? I refuse to say get your asses in gear. Because I don't want to use anything that's even a little bit off. So will you please do me a favor and work with my people and go out on February 1st and vote and give us a victory? I promise you, I will do such a good job. Now, if I lose Iowa, I will never speak to you people again. That I can promise.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: We have a powerful political line-up for you here tonight including Chris Stirewalt, Howie Kurtz, Marc Thiessen. But, first, we go tonight to Carl Cameron to set the stage. Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Megyn. The debate is still on going. But even before it began, Trump pre-spun it by tweeting that he thought CNBC, the hosts, weren't going to be fair to him. And that they're using fictitious polls. This is clearly an illustration of his frustration of having been knocked out of first place in Iowa by Ben Carson. And in the New York Times with the CBS poll this week now trailing Carson in the national poll. That poll shows that Ben Carson support is in-large measure from evangelical Christians in Iowa and across the country.And, particularly, some support from Tea Partiers. Ben Carson and Donald Trump have been sparring all week. Trump has been raising questions about his Seventh Day Adventist's faith, his positions on abortion and just suggesting that he's too low energy. Carson, for his part, both in the debate and in the last few days, has made it very clear he is not going to take the debate. The debate either for that matter. He believes that Donald Trump is creating what Carson calls a mud pit with all the name- calling and slams. And says, he's just not going to do that he'll be himself. Carson has to show that he has a command of interests of the issues themselves.And that he can answer questions in real specifics in very, very tight and bright scrutiny now that he is also one of the big frontrunners. After you talk about Trump and Carson, then you got to talk about Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. Bush has had a tough week and a half. Get it downsize his campaign. Earlier this week, he said if you have to demonize or be demonized, you might as well vote for Donald Trump. That make him sound sort of petulant in his -- he was entitled. That's a problem for him. And what Bush desperately needs to do in this debate is show that he's vigorous.That he's got a purpose in running for president and that he is not entitled and he's got his own ways of leading the country, not just last name. For Marco Rubio, it's an argument about a generation. He makes the point that Jeb Bush is of yesteryear, not just the last name. And while Bush calls Rubio, GOP Obama, Rubio comes back and says, it's time to have real change and get a real new type of republican conservative with new ideas.And lastly, Ted Cruz. The senator from Texas who made his name in Washington as it disrupt there going after the republican leadership almost as much as he goes after Democrats. Tonight, before the debate started, unveiled his plan for a flat tax. He supports abolishing the IRS and is making a pivot. His campaign plans to start giving out lots more policies and solutions, having spent the last couple years in the Senate talking about how he would break down what he sees as the problems in Washington.  A transition for Cruz as he tries to make his move into the top tier -- Megyn.KELLY: The debate bait. Nicely done campaign, Carl Cameron.Here with us more, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor. And Howie Kurtz, host of ""MediaBuzz"" right here on Fox. Debate bait. That was great. All those little late in any event.Good to see you both. And so you tell me, Stirewalt, it's only.  Because this is it. Carson goes into this debate tonight as the front rubber and at least delayed its national poll. And Trump who has said all along, I'm only a counter puncher. I'm only a counter puncher. Is now out there, I don't know what it is called, affirmatively punching? Striking it? What is it? When you're just punching. You're just punching. You're pummeling.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Just punching.  You're just punching at that point. Yes. Look, Donald Trump has a problem which is that Ben Carson is much better liked than he is. And the way you can think about favorability is what you've got in the bank that you can spend fighting somebody else. So, if you're Jeb Bush for example, you have low favorability. Trump has low favorability. Jeb Bush has even lower favorability. So, it's hard to get into a fight with somebody because every time you fight with somebody else, your favorability, your likability is going to go down, too. So the thing for Donald Trump is, as a guy who has gone through this campaign without having to spend money, without having to dig into his pocket to do this, now is the time he's going to have to start running attack ads against Ben Carson. Because Trump doesn't have the personal capital with voters to do this on his own.KELLY: What about it, Howie? Because already, before we've even started the debate, Trump was warning that it was going to be unfair.  Already to the shot at CNBC saying, I'm sure it's going to be an unfair debate. Where did that come from?HOWIE KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIA BUZZ"": Talk about working the refs. You know, Trump has been off his game during this latest Carson surge in the polls. First, he said he didn't believe, couple of the polls that showed that Ben Carson had in Iowa. And then he said the couple of pollsters didn't like him although their polls were perfectly fine when they showed him ahead. And then that clip that we saw of him, you know, kind of pleading with Iowa voters to get his numbers up, I know he was half joking, I know it shtick but it didn't sound great. And even a couple of little things like talking about the small million dollar real estate loan that his wealthy father gave when he was getting started, it just seems like he's off balance because he's lost his chief talking point which is that I'm ahead in every single poll.KELLY: How about the others on that stage tonight, Stirewalt. You know, Ben Carson, he has said some things that have caused a lot of controversy. And, yet, with almost no impact on his numbers. His numbers, if anything seemed to be going up. It seems like GOP voters are looking at him saying, I know it says some things that are -- but I like him so much.STIREWALT: Well, they like him so much, number one. And number two, the places in which the establishment press goes after Ben Carson are the places that make Republicans like him more. How dare you say you don't want a Muslim president? And Republican voters go, ding. When you say, how dare you say that abortion is like slavery? And they go, ding.KELLY: Yes.STIREWALT: So they're running ads essentially for Ben Carson. They think --KELLY: But Chris, even in the past two debates, Carson had, at best, you know, quiet evening. Right? He had a zinger at the end of the first debate. The second debate, I can't remember any. But his numbers continue. He's like the Teflon Don when it comes to the debate, it doesn't matter what happens for him. They just like him.STIREWALT: The closer you get to the end, the more important the substance of the answers become. So, right now, we are within. We're almost three months away from Iowa. It's going to get serious. But I would point out that at this point in the 2012 cycle, Republicans were still enjoying popping the popcorn and listening to Herman Cain. They were done with Rick Perry. They were ready for the Cain train.KELLY: Nine-nine-nine.STIREWALT: -- to Newt Gingrich.KELLY: Nine-nine-nine.STIREWALT: Blitz, as he called Wolf Blitzer. So, there is a thing that happens where you're interested in -- issues and then as you get close and you want to talk about more substance, I think Carson is going to surprise some people because I think that when he talks about a few key substantive points, he's very good in talking about it and he's very close to the debates as well.KELLY: Well, but of course tonight's debate is all about the economy, Howie. And this is supposed to be Trump's area of expertise. And so, a lot of people are saying that the pressure is on him and they sort of raise the bar on him to do extra well and, you know, wondering whether Carson can hang. I want to get your thoughts on that. But I also want to ask you about Carly because she made a big splash in the first two debates. And then her numbers went way up. And, now, they're back down. I mean, what - - I guess she could have another great debate. And then what happens?KURTZ: For whatever reason, she wasn't able to sustain the surge after that great performance in the CNN debate. So, this is a big opportunity for Carly Fiorina. But yes, she has to figure out how to build on it. As does Marco Rubio had two pretty good debates. Jeb Bush I think a lot of pressure on him. But going back to Ben Carson, I agree with Chris that Republicans like the things that he says that the mainstream press considers to be controversial or inflammatory. But here's the danger for Dr. Carson, he has said some things that are either confusing or contradictory on policy when it comes to taxes and immigration and the flat tax and things like that. The media scrutiny starting at the debate and continuing is really going to ratchet up on him because he's not just back in the pack anymore. And how he handles that I think could determine whether he breaks out of the Herman Cain mold and does have sustaining power beyond this.KELLY: Before we go, Jeb Bush, I mean, is it a make-it or break-it night? Or is that all B.S.? There's no make it or break it in the month of October in the presidential race and the year before, Stirewalt.STIREWALT: Well, tell that to Scott Walker. There are make-it or break-it. And the problem that Jeb Bush has is that he said that expectation stratospheric. He wrote in the race, he was going to push everybody out. He was going to do all the stuff. He's going to be great.  Now he's at the point at saying, he will spend his opponents to death. He will hit them with sacks of money in the face until they fall down.  Everyone yields to him. And he shall be the last survivor. And that's not very appealing. And it also means this. It means that if Jeb Bush cannot go out and do more, then fight with people. So fighting with people is not where Jeb Bush needs to be.KELLY: Uh-hm.STIREWALT: Jeb Bush needs to be presidential and rise above it all.  But if he does that, he risks looking like he's a sleeve on stage. So Jeb Bush is in a tough spot and he is feeling a lot of pressure from the donors who have funded his campaign that want return on their investment.KELLY: You make it sound very appealing to be in a fight with Jeb Bush. You are going to slap me in the face with a bunch of money? I'll take it. I like that.STIREWALT: Got to breakthrough. Jeb's got to breakthrough.KELLY: Great to see you both.STIREWALT: Bye.KURTZ: Same here, Megyn.KELLY: Well, Governor John Kasich has now unloaded on the republican frontrunners in a blistering speech about leadership. We'll show you that when Marc Thiessen joins us, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Do you know how crazy this election is? Let me tell you something, I've about had it with these people.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, there's little doubt that tonight's debate will prove crucial for the second-tier candidates. And in the past 24 hours, we've seen dramatic movements involving one of them. Ohio Governor John Kasich.  For months, he is largely stayed out of the fray. But now, he appears to be getting personal suggesting his rivals lack leadership and maybe incapable of running the country. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KASICH: Do you know how crazy this election is? Let me tell you something. I've about had it with these people. What has happened to our party? What has happened to the conservative movement? I'm fed up. I am sick and tired of listening to this non-sense and I am going to have to call it like it is as long as I'm in this race --(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Marc Thiessen is a FOX News contributor and former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush. Welcome to the party, Governor Kasich. There he is. I mean, it's like, with all due respected to him, he hasn't made news really at all in the entire election cycle. And so, this is his attempt to do so.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. It is apparently. And he's very frustrated and there's a good reason for that. His Real Clear politics average is 2.6 percent. That's why he's frustrated. That's why he's sick of this race. He reminds me a little bit of that old Saturday night live skit where John Levitt is playing Michael Dukakis and he's in the debate with Dana Carvey and George Bush and he looks in the camera and he says, I can't believe I'm losing to this guy.KELLY: We have that. Standby.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You still have 15 seconds left.DANA CARVEY, COMEDIAN: Let me just sum up, on track, stay the course, a thousand points of light.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Governor Dukakis, rebuttal?JON LOVITZ, AS DUKAKIS: I can't believe I'm losing to this guy?(END VIDEO CLIP)(LAUGHTER)KELLY: That's fantastic.THIESSEN: John Kasich can't believe that he's losing to Donald Trump and Ben Carson and Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio --  KELLY: Yes.THIESSEN: -- and Rand Paul and Huckabee.KELLY: But in his defense, that sentiment he's expressing, it could be so many of the men you just named. Right? I mean, you can -- I asked Governor Bush about this when he came on the program last week. That you look at him up there in the debate stage and you can almost read his mind that he's saying, I don't know how to deal with this. Like, what is it?  What is going on over here?THIESSEN: What's going on, quite frankly, is that the Republican electorate is really mad at their own party. I mean, there's an AP poll last week. Seventy seven percent of Republican voters want someone from the outside government and outsider who's going to shape things up in Washington. Only 22 percent want a politician who gets things done. So, John Kasich is a politician who is a case to be made, politician who gets things done. It's a really bad year to have that as your calling card.KELLY: Right. Like look at Scott Walker, John Kasich, both of whom have governed as Republican governors in, you know, purple states, have these proven track records and the GOP electorate has basically said, tell your story walking.THIESSEN: Yes. But you know what's interesting. I thought -- I actually thought going into this election is this is going to be a really good year for governors. Because if you think about it, people were frustrated with Washington. And one of the things people don't realize is that the Obama years have been in golden age of conservative governance, not in Washington, but in the states. We've got more republican governors elected now than in any time since the 1920s.More Republican state legislatures. So, half the country is leaving in states where there's Republican governor and a Republican legislature.  And so, they're enacting all this bold conservative reform. So, it made sense to think that voters would return to one of these performers in the states and make them the standard bearer to run against Washington. But it's not turning out that way. None of the governors are doing well. None of the politicians are in double digits in the Real Clear politics. Not a single politician is in double digit. If we take up all the people, all 11 candidates who either currently or have held elective office, together they get 36.8 percent of the vote.KELLY: Wow! All right. We're going to bring Marc back for our special midnight broadcast, post-debate. But I want to ask you. Any predictions? Do you have any predictions about anyone on that stage tonight?THIESSEN: I think that this is -- I got to watch Marco Rubio tonight.  He's sort of the horse that sort of desperately trailing but he's really running well and this day he has a chance to pull out. So, I'd be watching Marco Rubio and see what he does tonight.KELLY: We will talk about it later. Marc, great to see you.THIESSEN: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Well, the economy remains a top issue with voters. And the candidates are letting us know where they stand. Stuart Varney is next with the breakdown. And a look at which frontrunner may be in trouble here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to try one more time, sir. This is debt that's already obligated. Would you not favor increasing the debt limit to pay the debts already incurred?DR. BEN CARSON, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What I'm saying is what we have to do is restructure the way that we create debt.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: This is my wheel house. That's what I do well. The economy is what I do well.If I become president, we will do something really special. We will make this country greater than ever before. We'll have more jobs. We'll have more of everything.And the other thing I was really number one on was anything having to do with the economy, okay. Jobs, et cetera, et cetera. I was so high up, and then the other people, there was no number two, practically.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Well, there's no secret that Donald Trump believes that he's in very good shape when the talk turns to the economy. But what about his top rival. Dr. Carson. There are some new questions about a radio interview he gave earlier this month. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should we default on our debt?CARSON: Let me put it this way. If I were the president, I would not sign an increased budget. Absolutely would not do it. They would have to find a place to cut.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, to be clear, it's increasing the debt limit, not the budget. But I want to make sure I understand you. You'd let the United States default rather than raise the debt limit?CARSON: No, I would provide leadership that says, get on the stick, guys, and stop messing around. And cut where you need to cut because we're not raising any spending limits, period.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to try one more time, sir. This is debt that's already obligated. Would you not favor increasing the debt limit to pay the debts already incurred?CARSON: What I'm saying is what we have to do is restructure the way that we create debt. I mean, if we continue along this, where does it stop? It never stops.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining us now with a breakdown of the candidates and their economic positions, Stuart Varney, host of ""Varney & Company"" on the Fox Business Network. Stuart, good to see you.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS HOST, ""VARNEY & COMPANY"": Hello.KELLY: So his critics say that just shows a fundamental lack of understanding of what the debt limit is. Fair?VARNEY: Yes, he does show a fundamental lack of understanding about what would happen if you do not raise the debt ceiling. Just imagine it, he walks into the White House, he's the president and says, I'm not raising the debt ceiling. Thirty days later, 60 days later, we literally run out of money. And that new president is immediately faced with a total shutdown of all kinds of spending.KELLY: He seemed to be saying, I will be a leader and I will make them tighten the belt such that we don't get in that position.VARNEY: That's what he's trying to say, but it wouldn't work out like that in reality. If you said, I'm not raising the debt ceiling, period, it just wouldn't work.KELLY: What we've seen from a lot of these candidates is sweeping, rhetorical answers that don't really tell us how they're going to do anything. When it comes to the economy, has anybody done better than that?VARNEY: I think that all been very specific on how they would achieve economic growth. And they all want growth. They all want to return --KELLY: And does anyone standout from the pack on that?VARNEY: What stands out is the policy that's commented them all which is, tax cuts. Every single candidate on the republican side wants to cut - - individual tax rates and corporate tax rates. That's their way of getting the economy going. There's not a particular standout. It's that that policy is the policy of all of the republican candidates. And, frankly, I think it's a good policy. I'm very much in favor of it.KELLY: Of tax cuts.VARNEY: Absolutely.KELLY: But do you see because, you know, Ben Carson has taken a hit for talking about tithing. You know, how the church requires some of your money to go.VARNEY: Yes.KELLY: Can you explain that? What he's proposing?VARNEY: Well, he's brought his faith into economics. He's proposing a flat tax. He was on my program on the FOX Business Network and he said he would favor a tithe, which is a flat tax, of around 10 percent. In other words, everything that comes at you in terms of income, you pay 10 percent to the government. That's it. You don't work your way up the food chain. It's not going to work. It just doesn't work. I mean, 10 percent?  That would not bring in enough money to run this government. It's so simplistic.KELLY: Uh-hm. How about Rand Paul?VARNEY: Rand Paul is another flat tax guy. 14.5 percent. Ted Cruz is a flat tax guy. I don't know what the percentage is that he wants, but he's a flat tax guy.KELLY: Is any of that realistic? And we've heard candidates talk about that in the past. It's never happened. None of them has ever risen up to the frontrunner status and actually gone to the --  VARNEY: Megyn, I don't think it is realistic. It's reaching for the stars. It's going too far.KELLY: Is it pandering?VARNEY: No, I don't think it's pandering.KELLY: You know, what is realistic? Which of these republican candidates in your view has a realistic plan they could run against Hillary Clinton with assuming he's the nominee?VARNEY: I think Jeb Bush, I think Donald Trump, John Kasich, Marco Rubio. They have realistic tax cutting plans going for growth.KELLY: Uh-hm.VARNEY: Now, Marco Rubio would lower the top rate of individual tax to 35 percent. It's 39.6 now. He moves it down a little bit.KELLY: How do you feel about Trump's tax on the billionaires and the super-rich?VARNEY: Well, his tax --KELLY: He's talking about you.VARNEY: Thank you. I appreciate that. That's flattery and I like it. No, he's talking about taxing Hedge Fund managers. That's what he's really talking about there. And that's a popular move.KELLY: Oh, yes.VARNEY: Talk about a breakthrough --  KELLY: Giving out money.VARNEY: Oh, talk about a breakthrough, that's the way to go.KELLY: That's how people feel.VARNEY: And he's also talking about --KELLY: That's, of course, also what Barack Obama says at some point, you've made enough money.VARNEY: Yes, but he's also talking about bringing down the top tax to 25 percent.KELLY: Uh-hm.VARNEY: That's realistic.KELLY: What is it now?VARNEY: 39.6 percent but it goes to 43 percent with some allowances discounted on some --  KELLY: And if you live in New York State, it's like 70 or 80. I don't know. That's how it feels.VARNEY: If you're decent, real good money in New York City, and this is where you live, you're paying around 55, 56 cents on every dollar that you earn.KELLY: Uh-hm. Excellent.VARNEY: You think?KELLY: And, for that, for that you get pizza rats and --VARNEY: Can I leave now, please?KELLY: Now there's bagel squirrels. Have you heard of him?(LAUGHTER)We'll bring that to you another time. Stuart, it's great to see you.VARNEY: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Basically, the (INAUDIBLE) of taking on super-human strength.  It's come to that.VARNEY: While am in this segment?(LAUGHTER)KELLY: I'll post it online. You'll see what I'm talking about. And the next GOP primary debate will be on the FOX Business Network Tuesday, November 10th. FBN and the Wall Street Journal are teaming up with the RNC for the fourth debate. It will be moderated by FBN's Neil Cavuto and Maria Bartiromo live from Milwaukee at 9:00 p.m. Mark your calendars now.  That's less than two weeks away. I'll be watching.Well, one major voting groups is sending a warning to the GOP on the eve of tonight's debate. And the man carrying that message joins us next.Plus, the governor of Texas has drawn a new line in the sand on the issue of illegal immigrations. He joins us next on the story behind this and the presidential candidates who are standing beside him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEB BUSH, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: -- eliminate sanctuary cities, this is a brilliant incredibly stupid idea to allow --  (APPLAUSE)-- governments to violate federal law --(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, the battle over sanctuary cities and illegal immigration is heating up as the governor of Texas finds himself in a showdown with the county sheriff, who seems determine to provide special protections to the illegal immigrants living in Dallas. And the sanctuary city issue has been a hot button on the campaign trail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We have to get rid of these sanctuary cities. It's disgraceful.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: It's disgraceful.BUSH: We need to eliminate sanctuary cities. It's a brilliant, incredibly stupid idea.CARLY FIORINA, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Sanctions over the sanctuary cities of 1989. We now have 300 of them. We have been talking about in securing borders twenty five years and they never secure the border (inaudible).CARSON: I think a number of us are extremely concerned about this whole sanctuary city (inaudible).SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's an outrageous situation where you have this locality have basically decided because they've got a political agenda or a view of immigration law. They can somehow ignore the enforcement of these laws.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Republican Governor Greg Abbot is with us. He is the governor of Texas. Great to see you, Governor. So you've got the -- those GOP candidates for president on your side, but you don't have your Dallas county sheriff on your side and therein lies the problem for people like you and other states who are dealing with this problem. What are you going to do about folks like and the Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez who says, too bad.GOV. GREG ABBOTT, R-TEXAS: We are tired of these sanctuary city policies and they will not be tolerated in Texas. So as governor, I send a letter to the Dallas County sheriff, making clear what Texas is going to do. Because of policies like hers, Texas is going to pass a law that out laws sanctuary cities, that will put injunctions on sheriffs who fail to comply with -- detainer of provisions. But also, we are going to put the heavy hand of economic damages on this counties that failed to comply because we are going to ensure that local taxpayers have to pick up the tab, instead of the state of Texas, for noncompliance with immigration laws, but also, we're going to force upon them the waiver of damage limitations exposing this county.KELLY: (inaudible) wait. Wait, wait, wait.ABBOTT: To potential unlimited damage.KELLY: Because if you are super smart and you used to be the top law enforcement in your state, so you -- like take it to where we can understand. How are you going to make the citizens of Dallas pay the price for a sanctuary city policy?ABBOTT: The reason or the way that we do that is the state of Texas is now coming out-of-pocket for education cost, health care cost, law enforcement cost, related to sanctuary city policies that may be affecting people who are illegal to those particular counties. We're saying the taxpayers of Texas should not have to put that bill. If a local law enforcement officer who is elected by local citizens, decide to make that case, then the local citizens can kick that sheriff out of office.KELLY: And now, what are you -- you know, the argument by those who support sanctuary cities, and I know you mentioned Kate Steinle in your letter -- that was San Francisco. The argument is we need to make the illegal immigrant community feel that they can come talk to law enforcement, to report about other crimes, to report about domestic abuse, to report about bad situations, and if they feel that they're going to go to the cops and say, ""I saw something terrible"" and they're going to get cop slap on them, they're not going to do it.ABBOTT: Well, first, this deals with people who are in jail, not people who are out on the street. And what we're seeking to do is to require the sheriff to comply with the immigration customs enforcement demand that will be held for 48 hours before they're released from jail, so ICE can determine if they we have the ability to deport them. So these are average people on the street. These are people who are in jail, who are being detained and not allowed back on the street like the killer of Kate Steinle.KELLY: And you have the sheriff seems to have a different view saying, ""No matter what we do, someone is going to get upset.""ABBOTT: Well, listen, and that's the position of a law enforcement officer. And that is to enforce the law, regardless of who may get upset. And her obligation, the sheriff of Dallas County, the obligation of everyone in this state and nation is to ensure that we remain a land of laws and that means enforcing them, not applying them on a case-by-case basis as it is offer by the sheriff.KELLY: Governor, great to see you.ABBOTT: Thank you.KELLY: Well, as that story plays out, a variety of Hispanic republican groups have come together to announce that if Donald Trump wins the GOP nomination, the Republican Party and their view can kiss goodbye their votes. Joining me now Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the American Principles Project's Latino Partnership and Charles Hurt, Washington Times political columnist. Great to see you both, so.CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES POLITICAL COLUMNIST: Good to be here.ALFONSO AGUILAR, AMERICAN PRINCIPLES PROJECT: Hi, Megyn.KELLY: You had your meeting, which we talked about the other day.AGUILAR: Yes.KELLY: And it turns out Donald Trump was not a big winner. What -- how do the Hispanic -- these are republican Hispanic voters who have organized what -- how do they come to their conclusion?AGUILAR: Yeah. These are the top Hispanic, conservative and republican leaders and crews. And we had a retreat meeting all day yesterday, and we come out with a strong statement saying that if Donald Trump is the GOP nominee, we will not support his candidacy. (inaudible) that we are the groups. That conservative, The Republican Party, conservative campaigns come to, to engage Latino voters. We're not going to work for his campaign. We believe that if he is the GOP candidate, he will lose the election. We want to see a conservative candidate, strong conservative, but we want somebody who is constructive on the immigration issue. Insulting immigrants, calling for policies like mass deportation or ending birthright citizenship, that's not the way to we know we're Latinos. And in any case, it's really bad policy, not even conservative policy I would argue.KELLY: Charlie, I mean, as a practical matter, what would that do to Donald Trump if he were the GOP nomination or nominee?HURT: It would probably end up making his poll numbers go up or something bizarre like that. But you know, honestly, the problem with all of this is, you know, Donald Trump has -- obviously, he is a lot of course, and in politic language, they get a lot of people who are involved in politics very upset. But that exact same blunt, plain language, it's exactly why so many people have been drawn to him and that includes a lot of Hispanics.KELLY: It sounds like he's talking about policy, too.AGUILAR: No.KELLY: A policy too.AGUILAR: No.HURT: And -- but if you take -- if you pick apart, take away all of the sort of in politic language that he uses and the rough language that he uses, and you look at his actual policies, basically, what Donald Trump is in favor of is the exact same thing that Mitt Romney was in favor. It's the exact same thing that is all the law.KELLY: So Mitt Romney did not do well with Hispanics, Charles.AGUILAR: No, no.KELLY: He did not do well.HURT: But Megyn, he -- Megyn.(CROSSTALK)HURT: But 27 percent is not terrible.(CROSSTALK)AGUILAR: There is absolutely no evidence. What Charlie just said is just factually wrong. There's actually no evidence that Hispanics are gravitating towards Donald Trump. This is something that he keeps on saying, ""Oh, Hispanics love me."" That's factually wrong. Gallup has a poll that shows that his favorability rating with Hispanics is negative 51.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: If not Trump, who can he get behind in the GOP deal?AGUILAR: Oh, there are many.HURT: We're saying is the democrats.KELLY: Is there anybody else who was disqualified in your view?AGUILAR: No. Let me say who I think are good. Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Rand Paul, these are all.HURT: Jeb Bush is in favor of ending birthright citizenship. Why does he get a pass and Donald.(CROSSTALK)AGUILAR: I'm sorry, but you have -- Jeb Bush is not for ending birthright citizenship.HURT: Yeah.AGUILAR: Go back and read. Jeb Bush is for preserving the constitutional right of citizenship by birth. You're absolutely wrong about that.KELLY: How about Ted Cruz because when we talk the other day, you were on defense about him too.AGUILAR: Well, what we did is we issued a warning to candidates, that if they embrace Donald Trump's rhetoric imposition, we're going to call him out. We're going to have the next meeting in Nevada, right before the republican debate in Nevada. And we're going to see how the candidates are doing.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: All right, let me get to Charlie last word that he -- here's the thing Charlie. This is the same thing we saw last time around, 2012. Mitt Romney went to the right on the issue of illegal immigration. It helps him secure the nomination and it helps cost him the election, or so the pundits say. And is the GOP putting itself in that same position this time around?HURT: It's -- yeah. I think it's a very - it's a tough situation, but 27 percent of the Hispanic vote is not terrible for a republican in this climate, especially where you have so many people who are taking this issue and turning it into a divisive wedge issue.AGUILAR: Oh my, God.HURT: And trying to, and trying to -- and accusing people of being racist (inaudible), simply because they want to enforce.AGUILAR: Oh my, God.HURT: The current laws that are on the books.KELLY: But the problem with the GOP nominee is the GOP --AGUILAR: No.KELLY: The white voting population is shrinking in the country and the Hispanic population is growing, and the African-American population has been voting overwhelmingly democrat. And so the Republican nominee.AGUILAR: What?KELLY: Either needs to surge huge with the white voters or needs to do better with the Hispanic voters than Mitt Romney did.HURT: And as you know Megyn, all the professional policies here like to slice.(CROSSTALK)HURT: All by, you know, by race and gender. And the one thing that it's been appealing about Donald Trump is that he is sort of blown that up and he just talks to everybody the same way, and it's very offensive sometimes. But at least he's not doing, you know slicing the population by women and race which I find especially offensive.KELLY: OK, I got to go.HURT: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: I'm just looking at the exit poll the last time around.HURT: Yeah.KELLY: All right, great to see you both.HURT: Thanks.KELLY: Well, Jeb Bush has gone after Hillary Clinton in a hard-hitting new ad. And up next, Mark Thiessen returns a long with his old pal, Bill Burton on that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And she will be a third term of Obama.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How will you not be a third term of president Obama?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What letter grade that you would give to the administration?HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'd give him an A.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Which enemy are you most proud of?CLINTON: Well, in addition to the NRA, probably the republicans.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, as the republican rivals go head-to-head, one of the top contenders is instead targeting the democratic frontrunner. Jeb Bush has just released a new ad, targeting the record of democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: You should not be paralyzed by the republicans and their constant refrain, big government this and big government that. I know we can afford it because we're going to make the wealthy pay for it.We cannot afford a republican to succeed Barack Obama as president of the United States.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a constitution and the Congress is supposed to make wall, not the president.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.CLINTON: That's why I would go even the executive orders that President Obama has signed when I am president.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And she would be a third term of Obama.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How would you not be a third term of President Obama?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What letter grade is you give this administration?CLINTON: I give him an A.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Which enemy are you most proud of?CLINTON: Well, in addition to the NRA, probably the republicans.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Back with us now Marc Thiessen, Fox News contributor, former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush. And Bill Burton, former White House deputy press secretary under President Obama, So thanks for being back. So Bill, let me ask you, as a communications man, is that ad effective? And who is it trying to reach? Who -- to whom might that appeal?BILL BURTON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA: So, you know, I love Hillary Clinton. I want her to be elected president of the United States. But I have to say, that's a very good add. Like I feel I've been very unimpressed by most of the republican ads, but that was very well done. It's how you produce.KELLY: What do you like.BURTON: I like that it does such a good job of communicating with republican primary voters about who Hillary Clinton is and what kind of threat she is to republican values. It's very -- it's well put together. I think that it's not -- obviously, not going to play well in a general election, but that's not the game right now. We're a hundred away -- a hundred days away from Iowa. And that's who Jeb Bush's campaign is trying to communicate with.KELLY: But what is this about, Marc. He can't, you know, he has failed to really have any home runs on the debate stage or at these townhall meetings. So is this, you know, is this a better medium for Jeb Bush?MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, he certainly needs it and, look, I mean the problem, what I think he's trying to address here is the fact that Donald Trump's attack on him as being a low energy guy, have really hit home. And with republican voters, the biggest fear that republican voters have is that we're going to nominate another Mitt Romney, who's going to sit there while people like Bill Burton with his super PAC ads attack his record and the republican nominee doesn't fight back. And there is -- so they -- the last thing they want is a low energy guide who's not going to fight back. So what he's trying to do here is communicate to republican voters, and very importantly, to republican donors that he's going to fight back, but he's not going to look and sit back and wait for Hillary to attack and he's going to go after her.KELLY: Bill, what is the buzz in the democrat's circles now? Do they believe this is over? That Hillary's got them secured on the GOP -- on the dems side obviously, I mean that seems pretty clear. It's according to poll numbers, although, and it could happen. Who knows what the FBI is doing. But did they believe she's got the White House secure?BURTON: I think people think that Hillary has the inside track to get into the nomination. Bernie Sanders obviously has made a very strong run and now he's getting very tough. You know, as a result to the fact that Hillary has had a couple really good weeks. Bernie is really -- hitting her hard. He's coming out. He's attacking this whole campaign apparatus and becoming a little less disciplined in the way that they're coming after her. But, even so, I think that Hillary is in good shape. But the problem for Jeb Bush is that -- for Hillary Clinton, she went months and months and just tried to stay disciplined. And it takes a long time to get credit for being disciplined. For Jeb Bush, you know, he's been buffeted by Howard -- by Donald Trump and they're going to attack. Am I not going to attack. Now he's attacking. Now he's like, ""Oh, attack Hillary Clinton."" It's hard for him to seem strong, but it doesn't seem like he has a real strategy that he's sticking with and being effective with.KELLY: What do you make of it Marc? Because I talked to a lot of republicans who say, ""Who is going to do it? Who will emerge?""THIESSEN: I don't know who will emerge, but I'll tell you, I think Hillary Clinton is probably the weakest nominee we've had in a very long time. I mean, the fact that she like as the other day with the Vas, that problems isn't widespread. You know, 300,000 people according to the VA inspector general were lost their lives while they were waiting on VA lists. She said in that debate -- in her debate. She said (inaudible), she asked what's her biggest enemy that she's most proud of, the republicans. The republicans are her enemy, really not ISIS, not al-Qaeda, not Russia?(CROSSTALK)KELLY: The VA thinks she tried to walk back today Bill, by saying I just we shouldn't throw out the whole system and privatize it. But on that, you know, one of my top enemies is the republican. That is off-putting to some viewers -- some voters.BURTON: Well, I mentioned off-putting to a lot of viewers, like every republican viewers probably.KELLY: And even independents, I would imagine.BURTON: But at the same time, you know, Hillary Clinton is in politics. She's a partisan democrat fighting for democratic values and, of course, republicans are going to try to.KELLY: Yeah. They don't think.BURTON: Fight against her and the fact that.KELLY: You guys are going back. I'm going to see at midnight. Bill, great to see you, and Marc, you too. Stand by, we will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: We have a behind the scenes story on the republican debate tonight. When the candidates were not slamming their opponents, their competitors or what they have deem the lackluster economic growth under the Obama administration. They were very upset about their dressing rooms. Trace Gallagher has that story. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, LOS ANGELES: Megyn, the Coors Events Center has three levels, 37,000 square feet and it seats 11,000. So Rand Paul's campaign was a little disenchanted when he got this seat. In other words, if the Paul campaign said their green room was a toilet, they'd be correct. Chris Christie was also given a rest room for a green room. Christie's aide complained loud and clear, but an adviser for Rand Paul went a step further by tweeting out side by side comparisons beginning with this, quoting, ""Guess which green room belongs to Donald Trump and which belongs to Rand Paul."" We're told Trump's big screen and big lounge chairs had nothing to do with his big poll numbers. The Paul team then sent a picture of Carly Fiorina's green room with the caption, ""Hint, someone has a Jacuzzi."" And then one more tweet asking the world to quote, ""Check out Marco's theater."" Today, the chair of the republican national committee was asked by Martha McCallum about the disparity in digs. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: This is an athletic facility. It's not quite a Jacuzzi. It's a locker room. They're doing everything they can to space off places for all the candidates. I think all of it has been resolved.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: For the record, Carly Fiorina really did get a Jacuzzi, but apparently, this whole matter has been resolved because the Paul campaign later tweeted this picture, thanking the GOP for upgrading their green room. By the way, check out John Kasich's green room. He invited anyone who was bored to come over for a game of horse, and we never got to see Ben Carson's green room, but again, there were no complaints from the Carson campaign either.KELLY: It's just like when you go to a hotel. If you complain and you, you know, whine about it, they may upgrade you. Trace, thank you. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Tonight, at midnight Eastern Time, a special live edition of ""The Kelly File."" Don't miss the only place for fair and balance coverage of the GOP debate. Frank Luntz is with us along with this focus group of GOP Iowa voters, Chris Stirewalt, Howard Kurtz, Marc Thiessen, Bill Burton and more.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We spend tens of billions of dollars on illegal immigration. Yes, it will cost us something to clean up the act because we are really a mess right now. But in the end it's going to be much better and it's going to be the way it should be. And Bret, the key is, they can come back in, but they have to come back in legally through a process.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I do not believe you can round up and deport 11 million people, especially people that have been here 15 years, have not otherwise violated the law, can pass background checks and so forth. And there's got to be a process to deal with that realistically.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: A majority of the candidates standing on that Republican debate stage have previously publicly supported amnesty. And I am the only candidate standing on that debate stage who has never supported amnesty.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, the issue of immigration is front and center once again. As we look at the presidential race, the Real Clear Politics average of polls, these are the recent polls, nationally, there you see Donald Trump and Ben Carson essentially tied, and the rest of the field. And take a look at New Hampshire. Donald Trump has a bigger lead there in the recent polls in New Hampshire, up 12.6.Let's bring in our panel, Charlie Hurt, political columnist for The Washington Times, Amy Walter, national editor for The Cook Political Report, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, the Trump interview was extremely interesting. He's extremely good at this, because he dances and he dekes and he feints and then he disappears without backing down. When you asked him, for example, about his critique of the Romney plan, which was self-deportation, which is a lot softer than a force-able deportation, which he's advocating now, and you said, well, didn't you say it was crazy and mean-spirited? He denied ever having said it was mean- spirited. In fact he did.BAIER: We've got the quote actually from 2012 in a Newsmax interview: ""Republicans didn't have anything going for them with respect to Latinos and with respect to Asians. The Democrats didn't have a policy for dealing with illegal immigrants. What they did have going for them is they weren't mean-spirited about it."" He was asked about Romney. ""Romney had a crazy policy of self-deportation which was maniacal, it sounded as bad as it was and he lost all the Latino vote, he lost the Asian vote, he lost anybody who was inspired to come into this country.""KRAUTHAMMER: And in one of your questions you tried to give him a pathway out of this by saying has something changed in the last four years that would account for your complete about-face where were you to the left of Romney and now are you way to the right of where Romney was by calling for forced deportation? And he didn't take it. He simply -- it's so you've got to ask yourself, what kind of revelation did he have that made a guy who essentially said, you know, that Romney had lost everybody who was inspired to come into the country, a very pro-immigration statement, and now ending up way to the right on this, and actually in introducing -- because he's a frontrunner, he's made this issue, which was way off the table, the central issue, deportation or not. It used to be citizenship or a work permit, you get to vote. What kind of barriers you want to have at the border to ensure that there are no more illegal immigration. But now the debate is deportation. We've never had that.BAIER: Charlie, what about this in the big picture of this Republican primary?CHARLES HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, I think a big reason why Donald Trump has done so well in terms of reaching voters is that he, if you look at his plan as Charles was saying, a lot of these things are no -- it's no different from what Mitt Romney proposed. When he talked about the deportation task force, you're talking about Immigration Customs Enforcement agents.BAIER: ICE.HURT: When you're talking about the Trump wall, you're talking about the secure fence of 2006 which of course President Obama and Secretary Clinton, or Senator Clinton at the time, both supported. But what he does this, he does it in a way that is so animated and he renames all of it, all of these things, like the Trump wall, with a big fat door that's going to be welcoming. He renames it. And voters think that, well, he doesn't sound like a politician. He must really mean it. He must really be willing to do all these things. And so I think he has sort of generated an enormous amount of trust certainly among Republican voters, Republican- leaning voters. But I think that that same thing that appeals to those voters could very easily appeal to a lot of Democratic voters as well.BAIER: Amy, what's interesting is the other candidates, I think. I think everyone knows where Trump is and he's laid out the plan. But to hear Ted Cruz, go after really Rubio and others, and here is New York Times 2013 about Ted Cruz then, about an amendment he put forward. ""What Mr. Cruz has tried to articulate in both word and deed is a middle ground. It got no support from Democrats in Washington but it goes further than many on the far right want to go by offering leniency to undocumented immigrants here already, a path to legal status but not to citizenship, a green card with no rights of naturalization."" Going further, it says ""Asked about what to do about the people here illegally, however, he stressed that he had never tried to undo the goal of allowing them to stay. ""The amendment that I introduced removed to path to citizenship but it did not change the underlying work for the gang of eight. That was the compromise,"" he said during a recent visit to El Paso. Mr. Cruz noted that he had not called for deportation whereas Mitt Romney famously advocated self-deportation."" But to hear him today in New Hampshire, it sounds like he was closer to Trump than he was to Rubio.JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: He sounds like that even on legal immigration, on H-1B visas, saying now that I've looked at it and there's abuse and there are problems with this we need to cut back on that as well.So, look, what Ted Cruz is running on is he is the consistent conservative. Everybody else he can point to who strayed from the straight and narrow on the conservative path and he's been the one who has been there all along. And yet, there are going to be instances, obviously other candidates are going to take advantage of this, to show that actually he hasn't been as consistent as he'd like to be.  And, look, the muddier the water gets on this issue of who's been where on immigration reform, the better it is for somebody like Marco Rubio, the better it is for somebody like Jeb Bush, who will be tagged as the support for amnesty candidates by conservatives in this race.KRAUTHAMMER: Look, the Cruz position is slippery and technical. What he means is I never called for citizenship. But what he's not saying is what you just showed is that he actually introduced an amendment that instead of offering citizenship would offer essentially permanent residence and a green card, which is a position I happen to support. But when it comes -- but to then declare that I've been consistent, I've been against amnesty -- yes, narrowly yes, if you say that means citizenship. But essentially he has been for legalization of the 11 million. That's a position that I think he's trying to obscure now, and that's an example of opportunism.PACE: He'll say at the end of the day I voted against the gang of eight bill. Marco Rubio voted for it. He's for amnesty. I'm not. We can get into all the technical details, but let's face it --KRAUTHAMMER: But introducing an amendment is not a technical detail.PACE: I agree.BAIER: It is a big detail. What about quickly, the issue of immigration for Republicans? There's so many other issues that are seem to be low-hanging fruit there. This is a lot of time on the issue of immigration that is splitting this party up.HURT: Well, it is, it is a potent issue and it has been a potent issue for a very long time. And I think that the media, a lot of the mainstream media tries to ignore it and pretend like it's not an important issue. But it touches on so many other issues, like the economy, like health care. Like education. You know, it touches on all those things in a way that obviously Donald Trump has done a magnificent job of weaponizing to his advantage.And I think actually going back to what Amy was saying, that all of this obfuscation about politicians trying to cover up their record, I think in a lot of ways that helps Donald Trump, too, because he can just say, you all are all wrong. I'm going to build the Trump wall. And that's working for him.BAIER: By the way, you've got the Trump down.HURT: I worked on it.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" September 11, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.Fifteen years after 9/11, we'll examine the security of our homeland.  Are Americans more or less safe?  And how is it shaping the Trump/Clinton campaign?  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  As we pause to remember one of the darkest days in our nation's history, we get an assessment of future threats.  JEH JOHNSON, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  You cannot eliminate all risk, whether it is a terrorist attack or a mass shooting.  WALLACE:  Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson on keeping America safe.  Then, a debate between former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump advisor, and Congressman Xavier Becerra, a Clinton backer on which candidate is better equipped to be commander in chief.  Plus, is Russia trying to disrupt the U.S. elections?  ASH CARTER, DEFENSE SECRETARY:  We will not ignore attempts to interfere with our democratic processes.  WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel what could happen in November.  And our power player of the week, NFL quarterback Kirk Cousins playing for a lot more than winning games.  KIRK COUSINS, WASHINGTON REDSKINS QUARTERBACK:  God wired me to be a leader and to want to impact people.  WALLACE:  All right now on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  Today marks 15 years since the worst terror attack on U.S. soil.  Once again, we pause to reflect on those who died and in less than two months, we go to the polls to choose our next commander-in-chief.  In a moment, we'll speak with Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson about the threat the nation faces now, but first we take you to Ground Zero in Manhattan where family members are reading the names of the almost 3,000 people who lost their lives that terrible day.  They're about to mark the moment when the second plane hit the World Trade Center's South Tower.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Janice Lee Blaney.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Craig Michael Blass.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sean Booker Sr.(BELLS CHIMING)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Canfield D. Boone.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  May Jane --  WALLACE:  Earlier, I spoke with Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson about the threats we still face 15 years after 9/11.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Secretary Johnson, thank you for talking with us.  On this 15th anniversary of 9/11, how would you characterize the threat to the U.S. homeland right now?  JOHNSON:  Chris, we are stronger against another 9/11 style terrorist directed attack over seas.  Our government has become pretty good at detecting something hatched from overseas, launched overseas.  Our intelligence community is pretty good at picking that up.  Where we're challenged, however, is with the lone wolf style attack, the self-radicalized actor who is here in the homeland.  Terrorist organizations have the ability to into our home and through the Internet and recruit and inspire.  And that's a relatively new environment and requires a whole of government response.  WALLACE:  But I want to try, if I can, sir, to break down the threat, and let me put a couple of things up on the screen.  Terrorists now have a greater safe haven in ISIS than they've had any time since 9/11. The FBI says there are more than 900 active investigations against lone wolves and other suspects in all 50 states.  A test last year found TSA screeners missed weapons 95 percent of the time.  Last year, almost 500,000 people overstayed their visas and the number of African and Asian migrants trying to cross the border is rising.  Secretary Johnson, I don't have to tell you those are all serious holes in our national safety net.  JOHNSON:  A couple of things, Chris.  First, our U.S. military, along with our international partners, as we speak, is taking back territory from ISIL in Iraq/Syria.  We've taken out a number of the leaders, those focused on external attacks.  You're correct to note the number of open pending investigations by the FBI here in the homeland.  The FBI's become pretty good when it comes to their counterterrorism capability, detecting these types of things.  Aviation security, TSA is actually stronger now in my view than it was a year ago after those horrible I.G. test results.  As you know, we've replaced the TSA administrator, hired a new one, Pete Neffenger, who's doing a terrific job.  We were challenged earlier this summer.  Wait times have been reduced.  But we have not short cut aviation security and we're investing in more aviation security technology and more TSOs.  In terms of the southwest border, I just recently asked for them to focus on immigrants coming illegally from other hemispheres, from the Middle East and so forth, to detect them and block them before they even get to the homeland, working with governments in South America, Central America to prevent that from happening.  You're correct that we're seeing illegal migrants coming from Africa, coming from the Middle East.  And we're doubling down on preventing that happening before they even reach the southwest border.  WALLACE:  So, bottom line, is the threat we face now worse or less serious than during 9/11, because the chairman of the 9/11 Commission, Tom Keane and Lee Hamilton, say they think it's worse.  JOHNSON:  We're stronger when it comes to preventing against a 9/11 style attack.  We very plainly have a serious threat environment when it comes to the lone wolf actor, those who self-radicalize.  That's a relatively new phenomenon that we've got to protect against.  The public can play a role, building bridges to communities where terrorists were trying to recruit from within.  It's a new environment and a lot of people are working hard to protect against it.  But it's still here and it's probably going to be with us for a while, Chris.  WALLACE:  I want to turn to Russian hacking into our political system, Democratic Party files, election databases in at least two states, Arizona and Illinois.  Do you believe that the Russians are trying to undermine confidence in our democratic processes and what is the possibility that they could actually disrupt the vote count in November?  JOHNSON:  First, there's an open investigation into the DNC hack, into various intrusions that we've seen into state election systems.  It would be pretty hard to, Chris, alter a ballot count, alter how we tabulate votes in this country in part because the system is so decentralized.  There are some 9,000 jurisdictions involved in the election process.  But I've been sending the message to state and local election officials that my department, our cyber security experts, are in a position to help them further secure their presence on the internet where it exists.  We're in the midst of having that conversation literally right now.  And so, we're going to keep at that between now and November 8th and beyond.  WALLACE:  Mr. Secretary, does it bother you when you hear a major American political figure say that Vladimir Putin is more of a leader than President Obama?  JOHNSON: Well, Chris, I don't comment on what the political candidates say this election season.  I think we have to be extremely careful, however, in what we say about foreign leaders.  Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the aisle have a lot of concerns about what Vladimir Putin is up to.  So I think we need to be careful in our rhetoric, and that's -- that's a non-partisan bipartisan statement, Chris.  WALLACE:  Let me ask you about another non-partisan bipartisan issue.  In July of last year, you stopped using your government computer for personal e-mails and you banned all homeland security officials from doing the same.  Question: Why?  JOHNSON:  Well, accessing your personal e-mail online on a desktop at work is not a cybersecurity best practice.  And so, in Homeland Security, certainly in the leadership of Homeland Security, we've got to set the example.  We've got to be a model in terms of best practices.  WALLACE:  Do you know if your material -- material you receive is classified whether or not it's marked, whether or not there's a header?  Do you know simply from the content and do you feel an obligation to protect classified material regardless of the marking?  JOHNSON:  Well, I certainly feel an obligation to protect classified material regardless of the marking.  From my Department of Defense days I think I can recognize it.  In fact, very often when I'm in a skiff talking with my people I question whether something has been correctly classified based upon what I'm reading, based upon the subject of what I'm reading.  But classified material should be on a wholly separate system, separate and apart from the unclassified daily e-mail traffic that we see on our official networks.  WALLACE:  Finally, sir, you were a lawyer working in New York City on 9/11.  In fact, it turns out that this is your birthday.  I wonder, what is your central memory from that terrible day and how does it shape the way you approach your job as the secretary of homeland security?  JOHNSON:  Well, thanks for asking.  I was a lawyer in private law practice here in Manhattan on 9/11/2001.  I had just left the Pentagon nine months earlier as general counsel of the Air Force.  And I recall, everybody remembers the weather that day, how beautiful it was.  I recall, frankly, a real feeling of guilt that I had left public service.  I wanted to be back at the Pentagon where it was going to be all hands on deck.  And I remember coming down to a street in Manhattan, looking for a hospital where I could donate blood.But given the nature of the tragedy, the blood banks were full and nothing was needed.  You were either dead or you escaped.  And, Chris, I've dedicated myself over the last nearly eight years now in defense and homeland security to addressing the homeland security threats, making us safer and improving our national security.  Thanks for asking.  WALLACE:  Mr. Secretary, thank you for talking with us what I know is for all of us a very difficult day.  Thank you, sir.  JOHNSON:  Thank you, sir.  (END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Up next, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump clash over national security.  We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the threats one of them will face as commander-in-chief.  Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about how safe the nation is 15 years after 9/11?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday.  And we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A live look at the Pentagon where a crowd is now gathering to remember the 189 people who lost their lives there on September 11th.  And it's time now for our Sunday group: syndicated columnist George Will, Fox News political analyst, Juan Williams, Julie Pace who covers the White House and the campaign for ""The Associated Press"", and ""Washington Examiner"" contributor Lisa Boothe.  George, there's so much more security in this country now than there was 15 years ago but the threat has also grown.  Bottom line, are we safer?  GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  I think we're probably safer from terrorism.  There's an asterisk.  I'll come back to that.  For several reasons, the war began badly, the war on terrorism.  But our wars often begin badly, Oran (ph) or Pearl Harbor the Kasserine Pass of Korea.  And then, we begin to learn.  And we've done a lot of learning about terrorism and as the secretary just stressed, we've made technological developments.  Some of which we know, some of which we're not allowed to know.  I think we are safer.  I think the world at large is less safe, because the threat has metastasized and particularly because Europe, with unassimilated communities of immigrants, is just proximate, more proximate to the caliphate, the ISIS caliphate than it was.  That said, it seems to me America today is measurably less safe than it was 15 years ago for a number of reasons.  Putin is rampant on Russia dismantling the European nation threatening the Baltic states which are NATO members.  China is extremely aggressive in the South China Sea, which can be a threat at any point.  North Korea launches a missile that will someday soon be able to reach Chicago.  And then, Iran is another regime we cannot read but are right to be worried about.  The world is more ominous.WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel on this particular subject.  We got this on Facebook from Paul Puskuldjian.  Fascinating.  ""I was in the World Financial Center for the bombing in 1993 and then again in the World Financial Center for the attacks on 9/11.  The harsh reality is since 1993 not much has changed.""Juan, how do you answer Paul?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think a lot has changed.  And, you know, some of the obvious things are obviously creation of the Department of Homeland Security.  You just heard Chris's interview with Secretary Jeh Johnson.  Homeland Security is now, I think, the third largest agency in government.  Trillions spent to hardened targets that I think all of us have gone through airports and know that experience.  But I think that what Paul's talking about, Chris, is something that's reflected in the polls, like 40 percent of Americans think at this moment, that terrorists have more ability, more likely to attack us now than back in 2001.  And you see this in our politics.  Lots of politicians going for fear, concern, anxiety in their thinking.  This is particularly true among Republicans.  Higher percentage of Republicans, over half think there's more chance of an attack, only a third of independents and Democrats.  But I would just point out again to Paul -- we've had the Patriot Act.  The government has the ability to look at e-mail messages, financial transactions.  We have troops stationed.  We've degraded al Qaeda.  We've degraded ISIS.  All of these things in terms of the mass kind of attacks you experienced, either going back to '93 or 2001, I think there's less a chance.  What you heard, though, a few moments ago from George Will is absolutely true, that in turns of the lone wolf attack, or in terms of global political strategies coming in terms of a threat from Putin and China, yes, there's reason to have some sleepless nights.  WALLACE: Well, I want to turn to that subject, particularly Putin and the threat, and not necessarily the threat of terror but a different threat, and that is the threat of Russian hacking of our American political system, both the Democratic campaign organizations and apparently state electoral systems, at least in two states, Arizona and Illinois.  Julie, how seriously do they take this at the White House, the possibility that Putin and the Russians could be trying to disrupt our elections?  And what do they think Putin is up to?  JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  I think they're taking it quite seriously.  I think that's why you are seeing the White House right now wait for this FBI investigation to be complete before they officially say that this was Russia.  They want to make sure all the evidence is complete and they have that all in hand.  In terms of what they do, this is just such a complicated issue every time we deal with Russia because one of your major tools is sanction.  You could levy sanctions on Russia.  We're also trying to partner with Russia in Syria.  You saw Lavrov and Kerry meeting over the last few days.  The question of what Russia is trying to do, though, here I think is fairly obvious.  They are trying to create some sort of uncertainty in this election and in the process and then, ultimately, in the results which if you --WALLACE:  To what end though?  PACE:  I don't know what end.  I think the idea of creating chaos in American democracy might be the end because if you really think about this idea, no matter what happens in our electoral campaigns, we generally are confident that the outcome was accurate and correct, and if they can create some uncertainty around just the process and create just nervousness in the American population, maybe that is just their end.  WALLACE:  I want to pick up on that with you, Lisa, because the Russians don't have to disrupt our elections if they just create doubt about the outcome, about the reliability of the vote count.  They've kind of achieved their goal, haven't they?  LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, absolutely, and that's what they've just done.  And I think this is also just Russia attempting to flex its power, also flexing its muscles in regards to cyber warfare and cyber attacks.  Secretary Johnson had said he does not believe that Russia could ultimately affect the outcome because the election system is so decentralized and it is so vast.  That being said, Russia has been hacking Eastern European banks prior to 9/11.  Germany recently accused Russia's hacking parliament, as well as Chancellor Merkel's website.  Further, Russia was or at least is being accused of first electrical failure in Western Ukraine, knocking out electricity for 11 -- or 80,000 Ukrainians.  So, it wouldn't be surprising if Russia, you know, potentially tries to meddle with U.S. relations.  Also, Russia is the master of subversion and Putin was a former KGB analyst.  He knows that all too well.  WALLACE:  In Ukraine in 2014, in fact, there was a Russian effort to disrupt the electoral website there just before the presidential election.  George, this effort would seem to be right out of the Kremlin playbook.  WILL:  Absolutely.  I think it's quite right that what they want to say is we have our problems in Russia, at least we have orderly elections, so orderly, in fact, we know the outcome before we have the elections.  But beyond that, I just want to say that there is something wrong with the systems that are supposedly our rivals.  And to demoralize the United States, that is, to get people to think they have a government that is somehow tainted, its legitimacy compromised by inadequacies in the elections is an enormous benefit for the diminution of American power.  WALLACE:  You know, it's interesting because Putin believed that the United States and specifically Hillary Clinton helped try to work against him when he was running for election.  Do you think this is payback in some sense both to the United States and to Clinton?  WILL:  I don't know.  I don't know whether we did that.  I hope we did that because he was an extremely dangerous man.  But I don't think Mr. Putin needs a motive to --WALLACE:  You were nodding your head.  PACE:  I remember so clearly in the early days of the Obama administration, when Medvedev would come to Washington.  Obama was going out to have burgers with him for lunch.  There was a real effort to bolster him, make him appear as more of a Western-leaning figure, hoping that in Russia, that the population also would want that.  I think that has proven not to be true.  But, yes, there was a real effort to try to create another power center in Russia.  WALLACE:  All right, panel.  We have to take a break here.  We'll see you a little later.Up next, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump engage on national security, and we'll continue the debate with two top supporters.  Plus, what do you think?  Who would make a better commander-in-chief and why.  Let me know on Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and use #fns.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, the candidates spar over foreign policy and who will keep America safe.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  She's trigger happy and very unstable.  HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  He's very loose in his talk about nukes.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel to join the debate over who's fit to be commander in chief.  That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Who lost their lives in the service for others, your families love and miss you.  Today, we honor your memory and your life and the lives of all who lost that day.  WALLACE:  Observances continue at Ground Zero in New York city on this 15th anniversary of 9/11.  As family members read the names of the almost 3,000 people who were killed in four separate attacks.  Joining me now to discuss the new focus on national security, former Speaker Newt Gingrich, one of Trump's top advisors and Clinton advocate, Congressman Xavier BecerraGentlemen, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""  REP. XAVIER BECERRA, D-CALIFORNIA:  Thank you.  WALLACE:  Before we get to national security, I want to ask you both about remarks that Clinton made at a fund-raiser in New York City on Friday night.  Here she is.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  To just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables, right?  The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Congressman Becerra, she says that half, half of Trump's supporters are, quote, ""not America"".  Your reaction?BECERRA:  Well --  WALLACE:  She's talking, let me just say, she's talking about millions of people.BECERRA:  Yes.  She said she was generalizing but since then, she has also said she regrets that comment about half.  There are some, I don't think anyone denies that there are people there who are deplorable.  The white supremacists, the David Dukes of the world who are supporting Donald Trump.  And the great thing is that it's clear that there's at least one adult in this race who's willing to say, ""I regret a remark I made.""  But the more important thing here, bottom line is, we've never had a president who would be taking office, governing from a position of hate and anger.  And I don't think any of us -- I, as a son of immigrants, watching someone attack immigrants or watching -- women who are watching a -- a candidate who has said deplorable things about women. I don't think what we want is someone who will get into office based on advocating, campaigning, and then governing based on anger and hate.WALLACE: Speaker Gingrich, as the congressman mentioned, Hillary Clinton released a statement yesterday trying to clean this up. She says this. ""Last night I was, quote, 'grossly generalistic,"" and that's never a good idea. I regret saying 'half' -- that was wrong."" Does that make it any better?NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: No. Hillary's beginning to fall apart. I mean she comes out of a terrible national security debate where everybody -- where she lost so badly that the left had to attack Matt Lauer because they couldn't accept Hillary did that badly. She then says ISIS is praying for Trump to win. She then turns with this grotesque statement, which -- which any reasonable person -- I mean Romney got hammered for talking about 47 percent who dependent on government. She just made a statement in which she lumped together millions of Americans. She can go back and try to clean it up. That was, I think a deliberate statement on her part. She wants to pick a fight. Well, fine, let's get Sheriff Clark, who's an African-American sheriff in Milwaukee, who's for Trump, he can debate her on racism. Let's get Ben Carson, who's an African-American candidate, he can debate her on racism. The left has for years used vicious language to block serious discussion of their policy failures in the inner city. This is more of the same.WALLACE:  Congressman Becerra, just looking at the record, she has made this comment, not necessarily said half, but talked about Trump supporters being this basket of deplorables. It's a line she's used repeatedly.BECERRA: David Duke, he's deplorable. The white supremacists who go -- go out and say that they are supporting Donald Trump, they're deplorable. The people who agree that anyone based on their religion should not be allowed to -- to come to this country, they're deplorable. I think what she is saying, a lot of us -- my father could not walk into a restaurant when he was a young man because of the signs that said ""no dogs or Mexicans allowed. He was a U.S. citizen. He's not a hater, though, of this country. He loves this country. And what we have to understand is that we should not have people who be -- who get elected to office based on campaigning on anger and hate. And -- and, Newt, accept that fact that she said, I regret those remarks.GINGRICH: OK. Yes, but -- but --BECERRA: At least she's willing to say that. Donald Trump can't utter those words.GINGRICH: But -- but -- but --WALLACE:  All right, let -- let -- let -- let the speaker talk about then we'll move on.GINGRICH: But let me say direct -- Donald Trump has repeatedly, explicitly repudiated David Duke. Now, that's a fact. I mean Donald Trump has issued statement after statement. He has been on television saying this. So this idea that Donald Trump somehow is secretly courting people, that's wrong. Trump goes to a black church in Detroit to talk about the failure of Democratic Party politics -- policies in the inner city. Now let's have a debate about the failure of the Democratic Party in the inner city, which, of course, leads then to yelling racist because if they can't smear Trump, they're going to lose a lot of votes.WALLACE:  All right. All right.BECERRA: Are all Mexican immigrants --WALLACE:  Gentlemen, gentlemen, I'm going to move on to a --BECERRA: Rapists or --WALLACE:  I'm going to move on --GINGRICH: No, of course not.WALLACE: I'm going to move on to another subject.BECERRA: OK, so let him say he regrets that remark.WALLACE:  All right, they can keep talking, I will talk to you folks.And let's turn to Trump and his running mate and their continued support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Here they are.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It's a very different system. And I don't happen to like the system. But certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-IND., VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Mr. Speaker, we're talking about someone who runs, in Putin, a repressive regime, who kills his opponents, who invades other countries and he's more of a leader than --GINGRICH: Well, and more effective.WALLACE:  No, he said more of a leader.GINGRICH: In achieving -- in achieving his goals. But -- but let's -- let's go back to George W. Bush, who looked into Putin's eyes --WALLACE:  He said, ""he's been a leader far more than our president has been a leader."" And Mike Pence said, ""Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country.""GINGRICH: I think he certainly has been a very strong leader. But -- but let's go all the way back to George W. Bush, who said she looked into Putin's eyes and saw his soul. Let's go back to Hillary, who actually got a button out of a hot tub, painted the wrong word on it for ""reset."" Actually -- she actually painted ""overcharge"" because her interpreter was wrong. That's -- that was her opening. Let's go to this week where Secretary Kerry is sitting down, trying to work out a deal in Syria with the Russians. Let's go to Iran, where this administration's --WALLACE: But -- but you can't -- you can't be comfortable with this continued praise of Vladimir Putin.GINGRICH: I'm not -- I'm not comfortable or uncomfortable with it. I think -- I think that Putin is a fact. I don't think our effort to -- to say bad things -- I mean it's been pathetic. There was a red line on -- on Syria. It didn't work. There was a red line on Crimea, it didn't work. I man at what point do we recognize that this guy exists and calling him names may not be the best strategy we have.WALLACE:  Let me bring -- bring you into this, Congressman Becerra. I want you to respond to that, and also to the fact that Trump went on RT, that's the Russian television propaganda arm, to praise Putin and to criticize American media. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Just tremendous dishonesty with the media. Not all of it, obviously, but tremendous dishonesty.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Congressman, your reaction?BECERRA: How could you not feel uncomfortable with a candidate for president praising Putin at the same time that he admonishes our generals, he criticizes our own troops and he shames the families of American soldiers? It's -- he's running for president of the United States, not president of Russia. And it's -- to me, it's not just deplorable, it's, again, a sign of how he campaigns and why so much of what he does is deplorable. He seems to be kowtowing more to Putin than he does trying to get Americans to want to support him.GINGRICH: Let me say -- wait, let me refrain this for a second. Donald Trump went on Larry King. Now, I don't think Larry King is an arm of Russian propaganda.WALLACE:  Well, we --GINGRICH: No, but let -- but let's be clear.WALLACE:  Most of -- all of us at this table understand he appears on RT.GINGRICH: Yes. But I'm -- I'm just saying, he went on ""The Larry King Show."" Larry King has been an icon of American talk for 60 years. And I think if Larry King called up, you don't suddenly go, oh, my God, this would help the Russians. You go, Larry, you're an old friend, of course I'll do your show.BECERRA: Do -- you don't think that the Russians allow that network to public -- televise and publicize anything people want, do you?GINGRICH: I think that network allows Larry King to be on it and I think Trump did Larry King.WALLACE:  OK. Gentlemen --BECERRA: So (INAUDIBLE) suits the Republican.WALLACE:  I -- I need to -- I want to move on to another subject. Hillary Clinton had yet another explanation this week for her mishandling of classified information on her private e-mail system. Here is her latest defense and what FBI Director Comey had to say last July.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Classified material has a header which says ""top secret,"" ""secret,"" ""confidential."" None of the e-mails sent or received by me had such a header.JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: Even if information is not marked classified in an e-mail, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Congressman, that's the FBI director saying it doesn't matter if it's marked classified or not, it doesn't matter whether there's a header or not, classified is classified.BECERRA: So you want to be careful with it. And I believe the secretary has said numerous times that she regrets that she used a private server --WALLACE:  Then why was she talking about the header?BECERRA: Because people were trying to make the case that she should be prosecuted for having used the -- the private server because of classified information.WALLACE:  Well, we already know she's not going to be prosecuted, so she was defending her actions --BECERRA: Right, and the reason --WALLACE:  By saying there wasn't a header.BECERRA: And the reason she's not going to be prosecuted, Chris, is because the FBI found that she didn't intentionally disclose any classified information.WALLACE:  Would you agree that the header -- and we just talked about this with Secretary Johnson -- doesn't matter?BECERRA: I -- I, too, have reviewed classified information. Classified information typically has a very bolt and obvious header that says ""classified"" or ""top secret."" And what she is saying is that the documents that she may have passed along through her e-mails did not contain those bold, printed words. And the --WALLACE:  Congressman, I --BECERRA: Director Comey agrees that there was not information that boldly, clearly identified --WALLACE:  No, he didn't say -- he did not say that. He said that she did not have criminal intent. He didn't in any way say --BECERRA: There --WALLACE:  This -- I want to bring this up to you because this is the classified nondisclosure agreement that Secretary Clinton signed just as she became secretary of state in January of 2009. And here's what it says. ""Classified information is marked or unmarked classified information, including oral communication, I understand and accept that by being granted access to classified information, special confidence and trust shall be placed in me by the United States Government.""Congressman Becerra, it's clear the marking, the header doesn't matter. It's the content that matters.BECERRA: If it's classified, it would have that marking on it. And I don't believe there's any evidence that shows that Secretary Clinton intended to disclose any classified information. But as she has said, she understands it was a mistake to use a private server. She does not -- and as Colin Powell has also said, there are ways you use your e-mail that could become problematic, and that's why you (INAUDIBLE) to avoid it.WALLACE:  All right, I -- I -- I'm sorry, speaker, I'm going to bring you in for one last subject and that is because Trump's comments this week about U.S. generals and Clinton's response. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble. They have been reduced to a point where it's embarrassing about our country.CLINTON: What would Ronald Reagan say about a Republican nominee who attacks America's generals and heaps praise on Russia's president?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Speaker Gingrich, the country's generals are an embarrassment and in addition he seems to think, he said in that -- that candidate forum, that he could replace them. As you well know, I suspect as we all know here, yes, he could replace the -- the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, but he couldn't replace generals up and down the line. There's a system for that. He doesn't seem to understand that.GINGRICH: Well, let me say, first of all, I suspect he is reflecting the views of people like General Flynn. I suspect he's reflecting the views of the 50 plus analysts at CENTCOM who have now said they were explicitly forced and threatened in order to give false reports about ISIS. I think that there is a very severe problem in the degree to which the Obama administration has politicized the system inside the defense department. And you saw that with the recent memo for the secretary of defense on how to handle Speaker Ryan, which was an extraordinarily manipulative document. So I think there is a reflection among many retired generals and admirals that the Obama administration's influence has been negative and destructive and I'm -- I have --WALLACE:  But does that mean the generals are an embarrassment?GINGRICH: I -- I am very surprised that the CENTCOM scandal in which a general officer was -- was coercing his subordinates into -- into -- into putting in false reports has not become a larger national scandal.WALLACE:  I would love to consider this conversation with both of you and, in fact, we'll have you both back to continue it. Speaker Gingrich, Congressman Becerra, thank you both -- thanks for your time today.BECERRA: Thanks, Chris.WALLACE:  When we come back, Trump praises Putin and Clinton defends her e-mail. Our Sunday group returns to break it all down.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts and our truly -- when they call it intelligence, it's there for a reason -- what our experts said to do.CLINTON: I think what he said was totally inappropriate and undisciplined. I would never comment on any aspect of an intelligence briefing that I received.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Donald Trump giving a controversial look inside his intelligence briefings, and Hillary Clinton calling him out on that.And we're back now with the panel.So, so much material, so little time to go over it. Let's start again with Clinton's remark to a big fundraiser in New York on Friday. Here she is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: To just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables, right? The racists, sexists, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic, you name it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  George, the Clinton camp, I think it's fair to say, has been scrambling all weekend to try to clean this up. They say that she was referring to the people who attend Trump rallies, not to the millions of people who have voted -- I see you shaking your head already -- who have voted for him. How damaging is this?WILL: It's damaging for the following reason. First of all, every young writer is told early on in his career, when you say something that really sounds fun, like basket of deplorables, when in doubt, take it out, because it's probably going too far. But beyond that, Peter Hart (ph), a very talented, vastly experienced Democratic consultant in this town says the following. Go back to every election since the Second World War starting with Truman and Dewey, in every election except the Nixon elections, the most likeable candidate wins. Take all your fancy metrics and all your peculiar algorithms, likability is what decides this thing.Now, the Clinton campaign's problem from the start has been, the country has decided she's not honest and trustworthy and it's not easy to change that. But maybe they could make her not honest, not trustworthy but likeable. So the -- she goes to this event and she does something that's just not -- it's condescension. It's like President Obama talking about the people bitterly clinging to their guns and religion. Or 47 percent of Americans are takers, not makers.WALLACE:  Mitt Romney.WILL: Mitt Romney. The problem is cultural in this country, not just economic. That is, people don't feel just left behind, they feel looked down upon, despised by their elites. And that's much more volatile than an economic grievance.WALLACE:  Juan, I want to ask your opinion about this because a lot of people are comparing it to Mitt Romney at a big fundraiser in Florida with a lot of rich people, saying 47 percent of Americans just want handouts. Is this that bad?WILLIAMS: No, I don't think so at all. I think Mitt Romney made a mistake. I mean if you just want to look at the facts of it. But in this case, I think what Clinton has done, two weeks before the first debate, Chris, is I think she's sharpened the focus on who Trump is and people who choose to associate with Trump. I mean you've got to realize, when you think about it, Trump is not your normal conservative. He is not your normal Republican.WALLACE:  But to say that half of his supporters --WILLIAMS: She said she was generalizing. But the point -- and I think the point that will be taken away from this, I mean the Republican point is the one about condescension, looking down from the elitist point of view. But I think for most voters the point will be, hmm, Trump is trying to mainstream a lot of fringe groups, the birthers, racists. I mean you look at the poll numbers. Most -- and I think it's like 35 percent of Americans think Trump is a racist. And about 56 percent think that he has negative attitudes towards women, immigrants and minorities. So for them to say that there're a b group of people who associate with Trump, who have deplorable views, I don't think is that shocking. I think the question is, how do they take Hillary Clinton? Hillary Clinton's Democratic supporters aren't turned off by this at all. The question is about independents. And I think especially independent minded Republican, college educated women, how will they react?WALLACE:  Lisa, Trump had his own problems this week, as I discussed with our two guests before. He continues to praise Vladimir Putin. He said that America's generals have been reduced to rubble and are an embarrassment. He talked about his confidential intelligence briefings he's getting as a presidential candidate. Is that helping him in his trying to get past the threshold as a potential commander in chief?BOOTHE: No, it doesn't. I mean if you look at the issue, especially on a day like today, September 11th, on the issue of taking the fight to ISIS, that is an issue that Donald Trump polls well on in essentially every poll. But, yes, I mean, there is this narrative that Hillary Clinton is trying to drive about Donald Trump, questioning his temperament, questioning his judgment more broadly on national security and his abilities to be commander in chief. And I do think when he says things like that on both those accounts it does play into that narrative that Hillary Clinton is driving.But that being said, Hillary Clinton has to be able to also articulate and make that argument effectively. And what we've seen from Hillary Clinton is a candidate who has been on the defense for the past couple of weeks despite the fact that Hillary Clinton has been in the public eye for decades. She's had countless amounts of media training, mock debate practice. This is a candidate who should be much stronger than she is. And what we've seen from her is a weak candidate, whether it was the interview with Matt Lauer, the commander-in-chief forum, or even her basket of deplorables comment. This is a candidate who was incredibly weak despite having decades of experience.WALLACE:  Well, and -- and to that point, let's put up some polls which are -- which are fascinating because for all of Trump's supposed problems, the polls continue to close. Trump was down more than four points in Florida a couple of weeks ago. He's now tied. In Ohio, he's moved from down five to down one. And in Pennsylvania, that's narrowed from a 9-point gap Clinton advantage to six points.Julie, how worried are Democrats that for all of Trump's problems this race is close and getting closer?PACE: Here are two basic lines of thinking from Democrats right now. One is, how can this race possibly be this close given that Trump has insulted numerous groups of Americans and said things like praising Putin and criticizing the generals that would disqualify most presidential candidates? On the other hand, you hear Democrats who look at 2012, where Obama, in the end, won by a wide margin and the polls actually looked pretty similar at this stage. They go back to Clinton's ground game, which is quite strong in a lot of these states and say, in a close race you have to give her the edge given what she has on the ground.WALLACE:  George, your thoughts about why Trump is still within striking distance and, in fact, the race is tightening?WILL: Well, first of all, Mrs. Clinton is -- has this likability problem she can't solve. As you say, this could change very quickly. When Ronald Regan went to Cleveland for his one debate against Jimmy Carter, they were essentially tied in the polls. A week later, catalyzed by the debates, Reagan won a landslide. So there could be a lot of movement in this -- in this electorate yet. And it makes the first debate all the more important.WALLACE:  Are you suggesting that if Reagan -- if Regan -- if Trump were to pass the commander-in-chief sort of in people's eyes, their view of -- past that threshold, you could see that kind of a shift?WILL: I think you could if -- if either candidate does something that changes the almost universally deplorable narratives about both of them.WALLACE:  Do you agree with that, Juan?WILLIAMS: I would not say --WALLACE:  Would you think it's -- basically that much up for grabs?WILLIAMS: Well, there's about 20 percent. It's higher right now. Undecideds are higher in this race than they've been in previous elections at this time. And part of that is that people don't like -- if you look at unfavorability ratings, they don't like Trump or Clinton very much. And, remember, the media plays a role here, too. The media wants a horse race. And I think lots of times, I think that's why there was so much criticism of Matt Lauer and how he handled the debate. A lot of attention, Chris Wallace.BOOTHE: No pressure.WALLACE:  It wasn't a debate, it was an interview.Last word, quick.BOOTHE: But Hillary Clinton also has her own vulnerabilities when it comes to judgment and being commander in chief. You look at the way she handled her private e-mail server, as well as the Clinton Foundation. Further, you look at the failed Russian reset, the Uranium One deal that's been in question as well. And Bill Clinton giving speeches in Russia and getting a personal thank you call from Putin.WALLACE:  Lots to cover. As I say, so -- so much material, so little time. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins talks about winning on and off the field.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Today is the first Sunday of the NFL season. And we want to introduce you to someone who's playing for a lot more than just trying to pile up victories on the field. Here is our ""Power Player of the Week.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)COUSINS: At the end of the day, if you don't win football games, people aren't going to want to listen to what you have to say. So football's most important and we've got to win on the field. But when you do that, it sure opens some doors for some real impact to happen beyond just football.WALLACE (voice-over): Kirk Cousins is quarterback of the Washington Redskins and he's hoping to turn victories on the field into visibility for a cause he's been backing for years. He was a teenager when a man named Gary Howgan (ph) came to his church.COUSINS: I remember in that moment as a 17-year-old saying, if I ever -- if God ever blesses me enough to have the finances to really make a difference, that's an organization, that's a man that I want to get behind.WALLACE:  He's talking about the International Justice Mission that over the last 20 years has rescued 28,000 people from slavery and child sex trafficking around the world.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These little kids were on this boat and they were abused beyond imagination.WALLACE:  Kids like Joshua (ph), who's in forced labor and Ghana, and Elsa (ph), who's a survivor of sex trafficking in the Philippians.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Or dangerous situation, move yourself to a position of cover.WALLACE:  IJM puts lawyers and investigators into the field to push local law enforcement to bust these rings. They've secured more than 1,000 convictions, which brings us back to Kirk Cousins.COUSINS: You like that! You like that!WALLACE:  After leading the Redskins to their biggest comeback ever last year, the usually mild mannered quarterback had this outburst that caught on. T-shirt sales brought in $50,000 and rally towels for a playoff game raised another 30,000 that all went to IJM.COUSINS: I'm a big believe in the quote by John Lessy (ph) that says, ""set yourself on fire and people will come from miles to watch you burn."" In other words, when you live and play with passion, people want to see that.WALLACE:  But as Cousins knows, his platform depends on winning.WALLACE (on camera): Is that a lot of pressure?COUSINS: I played my senior year of high school football with no scholarship offers and had to prove myself to college recruiters at that point. That was pressure. And last year I was playing in my fourth year knowing that it was a make or break opportunity. And that was pressure. And so while there's pressure, it's -- it's nothing new.WALLACE (voice-over): Adding to that pressure, after their playoff run last season, Cousins and the Redskins could not agree on a long-term contract, so he's playing under what's called the franchise tag (ph), one year for $20 million. Cousins wants to keep playing and keep supporting IJM.COUSINS: God wired me to be a leader and to want to impact people and I see this as a great opportunity to do that. It's a challenge every day and it can feel like a weight or responsibility at times, but what an honor and a privilege and I pray every day that the Lord will help me to steward it well.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Cousins and the Redskins start their season Monday night when they take on the Pittsburgh Steelers. If you'd like to learn more about IJM, please visit our website, foxnewssunday.com.And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next ""Fox News Sunday.""Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" March 14, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know how many people have been hurt at our rallies? I think like basically none other than I guess maybe somebody got hit once. But there's no violence. I'm a peace loving person, folks.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The guy who is now saying he's going to pay the legal fees of the guy who sucker punched a protester the other day at a rally, I mean, the rhetoric he uses is irresponsible.GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This country is not about us tearing one another down or having fist fights at a campaign rally.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No one has the right to threaten violence. At the same time it is true that in every campaign responsibility starts at the top.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: A lot of focus on the trail about Donald Trump's campaign events. This as we get ready for Super Tuesday two. As you take a look at the map you can see all the states that are voting, and don't forget the Northern Mariana Islands, nine delegates, winner take all. The big ones, though, Florida and Ohio. In Florida, the RCP average of polls, the average of recent polls, has Donald Trump up big over Marco Rubio. In Ohio, a different story, where Governor Kasich in the average of recent polls has a slight lead over Donald Trump, but it is very tight. And as you take a look at the delegates currently, you need 1,237, a majority of delegates available to get and clinch the GOP nomination.So with that, let's bring in our panel: editor in chief of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Laura, a lot of the focus over the weekend, these Donald Trump events, he's dealt with it numerous times. Your thoughts?LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE.COM: I think there's a disconnect between what people are thinking in Washington and New York, and what, shocking, is being thought in the rest of the country. I think you can hold two thoughts in your mind at the same time. Number one, that some of these Trump comments off the stump, they're not wise. You don't tell people to punch people. It's just is not smart. Don't do it. At the same time, I think conservatives ought to be careful, especially the candidates who are in any way, shape, or form blaming the speakers for people who come in not as protesters with signs, silent or respectfully, but for one purpose -- to attack and to disrupt.And the videos are out there, what's being done in front of women and children, horrible language, very threatening, an inch away from people's faces. That's not real protesting. That's just violence. That's the kind of stuff you see at WTO rallies. I think this could have perversely for the people who are doing the protests, it could maybe help Trump in places like Ohio. I think people think there's a sense of unfairness even if they are aren't comfortable with some of the things that Trump is saying.BAIER: Mara, Marc Thiessen, Washington Post op-ed, not exactly on the books as a fan of Donald Trump, wrote this -- ""Organized group of left wing agitators intentionally come to Trump rallies to provoke his supporters. What we're witnessing is the latest example of the American left's totalitarian instinct to shut down speech that it finds abhorrent. This is not to suggest that Trump is blameless in the ugliness that is unfolding. He's using them to rally blue collar America by saying we're not going to take this anymore and we are not going to bow to the Alinskyite tactics of the radical left.""MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: It's certainly true that in past presidential campaign when there have been protestors it's generally helped the Republican law and order candidate. But I think there are two things going on. One is about the protesters behavior, and if they are violating the law, if they're doing something to the people who are going there, they can be arrested and removed. A lot of them are.But then there's a big -- a legitimate controversy about for the first time ever we have a presidential candidate encouraging his supporters to, quote, ""beat the crap out of the guy and I'll pay your legal fees,"" or ""I want to punch him in the face,"" or ""the good old days when people like that were carried out on stretchers."" Those are comments that really do cross a line.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think that's right. There are two separate phenomenon, the one obviously that happened in Chicago, it's organized, and this is the far left, also the far right. We saw it in the '20s and the '30s, the tactic of shutting the opposition down. And it isn't only something happening in presidential politics. This is happening on campus all the time, speakers who aren't allowed to speak outside of the Trumps and the others. We're just talking about the norm on campus, which is that the left acts in a totalitarian way controlling who speaks. That's a phenomenon. It should be condemned. And Trump and the supporters who are the victims here are not to be blamed. There's a second phenomenon which is other events which are happening in Trump events, and you get, as Mara said, Trump winking and nodding, saying, you know, in the old days we carried them out on a stretcher, meaning we used to beat people like that until they were unable to walk. We saw a guy on tape sucker punching a demonstrator in the face, and then saying on camera, if we see him again, we may have to kill him. That's lynch talk. And when asked about it, Trump said I don't condone it. That's great. But he refused to condemn it. And that I think is really unconscionable.BAIER: He did say he was considering paying those legal fees still.KRAUTHAMMER: And that's even worse.BAIER: Let's move on from the rallies. Today John Kasich was campaigning with the past GOP nominee, Mitt Romney.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MITT ROMNEY, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Unlike the other people running, he has a real track record. He has the kind of record that you want in Washington, and that's why I'm convinced that you're going to do the right thing tomorrow. Agreed?(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So Mitt Romney, who obviously gave this blistering speech against Donald Trump, the last nominee, but in this environment, Laura, is this the right person to be campaigning for you in Ohio?INGRAHAM: I think it's a cataclysmic mistake on the part of John Kasich. I think we all have a lot of respect for Mitt Romney, but let's face it. He gave that speech against Trump, and Trump goes in and blows everybody out of the water in Michigan, which is one of Mitt Romney's home states. He wins in Massachusetts, another Mitt Romney home state. I don't know how he would do in California, but I bet he would be pretty competitive.Kasich, he has to see what's happening in these rust belt states. He's the governor and he's pretty popular. If I'm Kasich, I'm going to tell people, I hear you. I'm going to do these deals differently. I'll do them smarter. I'll do them better. Trump says he will, but I know how to do it and I'm going to do it really well and you're going to love what you see from me. To me that would be a smarter move than bringing in the same guy who's lost twice before, establishing his establishment credentials. I think it's a mistake.BAIER: Mara, let me ask you, if Kasich wins and he pulls out this victory, and Laura's right, he has an 80 percent approval rating in Ohio, this goes a long way when you're governor. If he does that, does the nomination battle take a hiccup for Trump to get to 1,237?LIASSON: It does. If Rubio could also win his home state, which looks much less likely, then that's a real speed bump if Trump loses Ohio and Florida. But yes, I think it's a hiccup. But then what happens next? You go on to New York, New Jersey, California. Those are big states. Who is going to do better than Trump in those states? John Kasich? I don't think so. The other thing about Ohio, this is a governor, not a senator. He pretty much controls the Ohio Republican party.BAIER: The machine.LIASSON: The machine has endorsed him. The Florida Republican party did not make a choice in this election. They stayed neutral. So he has control of the machinery. He has a lot of advantages in Ohio that no other home state senator did.BAIER: We head to New York tonight to do a show from New York ahead of coverage tomorrow. I'm going to lay out a couple of the scenarios on the delegate math and how you get there or you don't get there. But it gets tougher for any candidate not Donald Trump if he wins both of them. And it's pretty much a lock.KRAUTHAMMER: It's probably over if he wins both. There are mathematical ways of stopping Trump, but I don't see it actually happening on the ground. The momentum will build. The other two candidates will drop out. For the way -- Romney outlined the only way there would be a way to stop Trump, which is for the others to stay in the race. I could see if Rubio drops out after tomorrow, you still have Kasich, if he stays in there, holds some of the states, they all hold on to their delegates. It's possible you could get Trump coming into Cleveland with a 45 percent plurality. And then you have an open convention. So that's the road. I would even say if Trump doesn't win Ohio, that is a more likely scenario than Trump winning everything, but both are sort of almost even.BAIER: Quickly, Ted Cruz. I mean, he continues to say he can shoot the moon and get to 1,237. It is really tough mathematically to see that. He's playing in Florida and he's coming in close to second.INGRAHAM: I've been watching what's happening in Pennsylvania, which is coming up. It's another key state where the issue of trade is so important. I don't think he competes there well. New York, New Jersey, obviously not. California, people think it's all immigrants. But there are a lot of old time Republican voters there too. Does he have the money to compete in California? I don't think he has as much money as he'd like. I think it's going to be hard for him. But he's run a very smart campaign. I think he has an enormous amount of credibility for good reason among conservatives. So if anyone is thinking Ted Cruz is going to drop out if Trump wins Ohio and Florida, why should he?BAIER: What's amazing, if Trump was not in this race, Ted Cruz would be riding this outsider wave.INGRAHAM: He had a plan. It was a completely plausible plan. He did consolidate the conservative vote, except for he didn't count on Donald Trump, didn't count on Donald Trump winning evangelicals. But he's done about as best as anyone could. The way he's playing tomorrow night is smart. He's looking for delegates. He is not trying to win these states. He's just trying to rack up delegates.BAIER: Illinois and North Carolina.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  Welcome to the ""Journal: Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.  Issues of national security dominating the presidential campaign this week as the nation commemorates the 15th anniversary of the September 11th attacks.  Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump participated in a commander-in-chief forum Wednesday night before an audience of veterans and active-duty military personnel.  And both candidates raised some eyebrows with their answers, with Donald Trump doubling down on his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hillary Clinton promising not to put ground troops in Syria and Iraq.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  If he says great things about me I'm going to say great things about him me.  I've already said he is very much of a leader.  You can say isn't that a terrible thing?  And the man has a very strong control over a country.  Now it's a very different season and I don't know to like the system but certainly in that system he's been a leader.  Far more than our president has been a leader.  HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They are not going to get ground troops.  We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again.  And we're not putting ground troops into Syria.  We're going to defeat ISIS without committing American ground troops.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Joining the panel this week Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; columnists, Mary Anastasia O'Grady and Bill McGurn; and Mary Kissel, host of ""Opinion Journal"" on ""WSJ Live.""  Dan, it seems to me the core argument that Hillary Clinton is trying to make here is that Donald Trump is unfit to be commander-in-chief, leading military forces, making life-and-death decisions.  How did Trump meet that challenge?  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR:  Well, I thought he did pretty well, by and large, in that confrontation with her and Matt Lauer, though he has this propensity to shoot himself in the foot.  And if that doesn't work, he shoots himself in the other foot with remarks like Putin has 82 percent approval rating --(LAUGHTER)-- and Russia making -- you wonder what's the other 18 percent or even where they are -- and seizing the oil.  I mean, we didn't seize the oil. We're not going to seize the oil.  Why keep bringing it up?  That said, Paul, the fact is that in the CNN poll, Hillary Clinton's rating for commander-in-chief, people who want her to be commander-in-chief, is 50 percent.  In The Washington Post, it's 46 percent.  Why isn't a person who has been secretary of state for four years, a U.S. Senator, the most famous public woman in the world, getting more support than that to become commander-in-chief?  Hillary Clinton has some sort of difficult ceiling that has fallen over her on these issues.  I think there's room for Donald Trump to grow if he will stop shooting himself in the foot.  GIGOT:  Mary?  MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, COLUMNIST:  I think Dan hits on the right point, but just to go a little bit further with it, the problem for Donald Trump is not that Hillary Clinton would be a disaster as commander-in-chief, but that he doesn't take advantage of the fact that the real problem in Iraq is that the Obama administration gave Iraq back after we had done the surge and we had a victory.  And once they gave Iraq back, the whole thing fell apart.  What does Trump do instead?  He talks about we should never go to walk, which, A, is not true and, B, is not a very strong argument for national security.  GIGOT:  There's a real debate whether or not he was opposed to the war at the start.  O'GRADY:  He came out and said, yeah, that he was mildly in favor of going?  GIGOT:  Bill, this Putin bromance by Trump, you know, Putin is somebody who is working against American interests in Europe and he's working against American interests in the Middle East.  BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  Right.  GIGOT:  Why would you say such favorable things about this authoritarian? I don't get it.  MCGURN:  Very simple reason, Paul, he's not Irish.  If you're Irish --(LAUGHTER)-- you recognize enemy.  ""My enemy can also be my enemy.""  (LAUGHTER)And it's amazing, given, you know, his stand on Iran because Syria is crucial to Iran and so forth.  He just seems to have a binary track that, because the Russians might kill some ISIS leaders, then they're on our side.  We ignore Ukraine.  Ignore Europe.  We ignore the rest of the Syrian problem.  So it's just -- I think it's a binary track.  GIGOT:  He's playing into Hillary Clinton's hands with this, Mary.  MARY KISSEL, HOST, OPINION JOURNAL ON WSJ LIVE:  He certainly is.  He certainly is.  It's a shame because there's so much about Hillary Clinton's record that you could critique.  You could look, for example, her support of the Iran deal.  You could look at the reset with Putin in Russia that went so wrong.  You can look at her handling of Libya.  You can look at Chinese aggression in the South China Sea and what she said about that. And as Mary said, he just misses all of these opportunities.  GIGOT:  On that Russia point, Hillary Clinton and a lot of Democrats, including President Obama, are now suddenly very hawkish about Vladimir Putin.  That wasn't the case for six or seven years.  And Hillary Clinton was the architect of the reset.  Suddenly, she thinks it's back to the Cold War here.  And some of that might be artificial?  O'GRADY:  Right now, these two candidates are fighting for Independent and undecided voters.  I think most of those voters are not expecting some kind of mapped-out plan about how they're going to, you know, defeat Vladimir Putin.  But they want instincts.  They want the right gut reaction.  In the case of Russia, both Mrs. Clinton and Trump have treated the human rights violations inside the country as something that's totally unimportant. That is not what the United States -- tradition of the United States has been since the Cold War.  GIGOT:  Dan, what do you make of the ground troop assertion by Mrs. Clinton?  No ground troops ever in Syria and Iraq.  HENNINGER:  Yeah.  I'll tell you what I make of that, Paul.  What I make of that is that Hillary Clinton does not believe that, but Hillary Clinton said that because that's what her party wants her to say.  This is not the party of Bill Clinton or the party of Harry Truman.  It is now the Democratic party of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi.  And they do not want to commit the military anywhere in the world because that would require increases in military spending, which Donald Trump is proposing.  Hillary Clinton is constrained by her party. We have to keep that in mind that it isn't just this one person.  It's an entire Democratic Party mindset that will govern her national security policy.  That is not true on the Republican side with Donald Trump.  GIGOT:  Briefly, Bill, by the way, there are troops, ground troops --(CROSSTALK)  MCGURN:  There are troops in Syria and Iraq.  (LAUGHTER)And Americans don't realize what we have.  Dan is absolutely right.  The only thing the party cares about is her vote authorizing force in Iraq. They don't care -- the worst vote was her opposition to the surge.  GIGOT:  To the surge.MCGURN:  And so forth, which was political.  But that party doesn't want us involved anywhere.  And that's what she's going to be constrained by is she's elected president.  GIGOT:  She may regret that because she may have to deploy ground troops to defeat ISIS.  MCGURN:  Right.GIGOT:  All right.Up next, the race for the White House continues to tighten with a new batch of polls showing Donald Trump closing in on Hillary Clinton nationally and even in key battleground states.  Pollster Doug Schoen breaks it down, next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  More evidence this week that the race for president is tightening, with the latest RealClearPolitics polling average giving Hillary Clinton a narrow 2.7 point lead over Donald Trump, down from 4.5 points last week.   And in a four-way race, with Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party Candidate Jill Stein, that lead shrinks further to 2.1 point.  Trump is chipping away at Clinton's lead in some battleground states as well with a new batch of Quinnipiac polls showing the race neck and neck in Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio.  Doug Schoen is a Democratic pollster and former adviser to President Bill Clinton.  Welcome back.DOUG SCHOEN, POLLSTER & FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR TO BILL CLINTON:   Thanks, Paul.  GIGOT:  When you were last here, I gave you a hard time because the brace had widened with Clinton and you had said this is a really a pick-'em race. Now it's back to where you said, so I congratulations.  SCHOEN:  Thank you.  GIGOT:  Now, why is it tightening again?  SCHOEN:  A couple of reasons.  First, the convention bounce that Secretary Clinton had has largely eroded.  Second, the continuing e-mail scandal she has shown no signs of abating with the release of the FBI notes and additional e-mails.  And third, Paul, I don't think fundamentally the American people or a majority of them want to elect Secretary Clinton.  And they have two choices they have doubts about, Secretary Clinton and Donald Trump.  GIGOT:  What are the doubts about Clinton?  Is it the fact they're reluctant to vote for somebody in the public eye for 25 years and been so controversial and they want to move on to something new?  Is it that basic?  SCHOEN:  It is that basic.  And there's one other thing.  There is a lack of trust and credibility in the secretary of state, with negative ratings in those areas, around 60, sometimes as high as 65 percent.  It's very hard, not impossible, I underscore, but very hard to get elected president when a majority, a substantial majority of the American people don't really think that you can be trusted to be honest and credible.  GIGOT:  The flip side of that, OK, as I look at the polls here, head to head, it looks like her support has fallen.  SCHOEN:  It has.  GIGOT:  OK.  But Trump's has not necessarily risen.  So that's why they're now more or less even.  SCHOEN:  Right.  GIGOT:  So what does Trump have -- first of all, do you agree with that analysis?  SCHOEN:  I do very much agree with that.  GIGOT:  What has to happen for us to break out of that tie?  SCHOEN:  People have different doubts about Trump.  They wonder about his temperament.  They wonder about his qualifications and his positions in some of the issues that we've been talking about, both you and I, on your panel earlier, about Russian and Putin, and foreign policy.  The question is, is Donald Trump up to the job, which is why the first debate, I think, is so important.  What I took away from the town hall with Matt Lauer was that Trump is in the hunt, is credible, but he's by no means closed the sale, Paul.  GIGOT:  So is Trump now getting the support of enough Republicans to win? I mean, my sense is he's got to get above 90 percent or so and he was down in the low to mid 70s before.  SCHOEN:  He's gotten in the low to mid 80s now.  So it's going in the right direction.  The problem he has is getting the rest of the Republicans back so that the 90 percent number is hit, and then expanding his constituency with women and minorities to get at least a traditional Republican vote, because right now he's polling below norm in those two or three groups.  GIGOT:  I talked to a Republican this week who said that, as he was following a race in August in Pennsylvania, for example, a state that Donald Trump says he can win and hopes to win.  SCHOEN:  And needs to win.  GIGOT:  OK.  Needs to win.  All right.  But he said that if you looked at what happened in the Philadelphia suburbs, not the core of Philly, but in the suburbs where there are a lot of Republicans, Trump, the bottom fell out of his support in August.  Who are those voters and what does he need to do to get them back?  SCHOEN:  They are suburban, educated, moderate conservatives, certainly not extreme conservatives --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  College educated?  SCHOEN:  Absolutely, college educated, and people who see themselves as refined, civilized people who don't like the Clintons.  They're not Democrats.  But they pride themselves on their independence and their rationality.  And much about the Trump message and presentation so far has been off putting.GIGOT:  The Judge Curiel attacks, the Khan attack, that would have rubbed them very much the wrong way.  SCHOEN:  Absolutely, the wrong way.  What they do respond to is a message of change because they don't like President Obama, they don't like Secretary Clinton.  They want alternative politics and policies.  So far, Trump has begun but hasn't quite developed a coherent narrative.  GIGOT:   We also have two third-party candidates.SCHOEN:  We do.GIGOT:  Particularly, Gary Johnson, a Libertarian.  I see him in the polls 7 percent to 12 percent.  SCHOEN:  Correct.GIGOT:  That's higher than a Libertarian has looked in a long time in a presidential race.  And Jill Stein, 3 percent or 4 percent.  How do you explain their staying power and would you anticipate that that goes down over time?  SCHOEN:  Sure.  I think their staying power is a reflection of rejection of Trump and Clinton.  GIGOT:  It's about those two?  SCHOEN:  It's about those two.  One interesting thing with Gary Johnson, his voters on the down-ballot votes are about 2-1 Republican, but yet they are people who heretofore look like they're inclined towards Secretary Clinton in a two-way race than Donald Trump.  So who they are and how they vote is going to be a key question going forward.  GIGOT:  Why would they be Republicans and then be more inclined to vote for Mrs. Clinton?  It's just --(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN:  Disaffection from Donald Trump.  GIGOT:  With Trump.  So is it better for Trump or Clinton to have Johnson in the debates?  SCHOEN:  I think it is probably better for Clinton to have him -- Johnson and Stein -- Stein won't be in, but Johnson -- to just deflect from the one-on-one confrontation.  But so far, I think the Aleppo comment, not knowing where it was, that will freeze his vote.  GIGOT:  All right.  Thank you, Doug Schoen, for being here.  SCHOEN:  Thank you, Paul.GIGOT:  We appreciate it.When we come back, with scandals continuing to dog Hillary Clinton, her campaign turns the tables on Donald Trump, accusing the GOP nominee of some Pay-to-Play of his own.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I got tickled the other day when Mr. Trump called my foundation a criminal enterprise.  (LAUGHTER)That was pretty funny considering he made a political contribution to the attorney general of Florida who at the time had an office investigating Trump University.  And mysteriously the investigation vanished.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Former President Bill Clinton this week attempting to turn the tables on Donald Trumps as the fallout continues over Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server and accusations of Pay-to-Play at the Clinton Foundation.  At issue is a $25,000 donation Trump's foundation made to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013 at the same time her office was considering joining an investigation into Trump University.  Bondi decided against joining the multistate fraud probe.  And Trump was recently forced to pay a $2500 fine to the IRS for making a political contribution through a tax-exempt charitable group.  We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary O'Grady, Bill McGurn and Mary Kissel.  Mary, Donald Trump famously said during the primaries, when I give a donation to politicians, I do it because I know I can buy them.  (LAUGHTER)O'GRADY:  Yeah.GIGOT:  Is this an illustration of that?  O'GRADY:  I think it is.  I think frankly it stinks.  But to hear Bill Clinton accuse Donald Trump of Pay-to-Play is really a joke, isn't it? This is the guy who took how many millions of dollars from authoritarian third world regimes for his own pocket?  I mean, give me a break here.  GIGOT:  So the Bondi episode is troubling to you, ethically?  O'GRADY:  I think so.  GIGOT:  Is that fair?  Is that fair?  O'GRADY:  Absolutely.  GIGOT:  But it's a question of proportion?  Is that the issue, Bill?  MCGURN:  Paul, I think it's two things.  One is, the real scandal here is what's legal.  If Donald Trump had made this a regular contribution, it would all be legal.  It's because he did it through his charity.  And second --GIGOT:  That's why he paid the fine.  MCGURN:  That's why he paid the fine.  But if he did it just as a regular contribution it would have been fine.  GIGOT:  What do you think?MCGURN:  But it's still smelly.  GIGOT:  What do you think?MCGURN:  I think it stinks.  But the interesting thing about it the Bill Clinton defense is this is the classic Clinton defense, ""They're as sleazy as we are.""  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  Everybody does it, right, Dan?  HENNINGER:  Well, yeah, I suppose everybody does do it, Paul.  But we're talking about politics.  And you know, on a scale of one to 10, the Clinton Foundation is about 100.  And this Bondi thing is about a two.  I mean, you're just not going to be able to sustain this contribution to Pam Bondi over the next two months.  On the other hand, Democrats all across the country have been pleading with the Clintons to separate themselves from the Clinton Foundation before the roof collapses on them.  It's just one problem after another.  And the Democrats are worried that there's going to be a landmine out there related to the Clinton Foundation that is going to blow up on them before the election.  But they will not give it up.  They say, all we do is good things with this charity --(LAUGHTER)-- end of story.  That's not the end of the story.  GIGOT:  All right.  But on the FBI notes released last week before the labor day holiday, conveniently, by the FBI, what did you learn from them, from that -- those documents that you think are significant?  O'GRADY:  Well, I think, first of all, it confirmed the sense that people had about Jim Comey when he decided not to go after Hillary Clinton.  GIGOT:  The FBI director.O'GRADY:  Yeah.  I mean, he -- first of all, by releasing them on that Friday before a long weekend, there was a real sense that he was just trying to get it out there but at a time when it wouldn't get much press.   And then inside of those notes. you find that, you know, all of her denials about never having, you know, used her private server to do anything related to classified information are just out-and-out lies.  And the FBI knew that.  They did not bother to interview her at the beginning of the investigation but rather waited until the very end, which is very unusual for the way that these kinds of investigations go.  GIGOT:  It happens, but not regular practice.  O'GRADY:  It doesn't make sense really.  But there's a whole string of strange things that happened in this so-called investigation that really don't add up.  And leave the electorate feeling like Jim Comey really did not do a full-fledged investigation of her because she is the Democratic nominee for the election in November and he didn't want to blow that up.  GIGOT:  Jim Comey issued a statement that leaked this week to former FBI officials, Mary, saying, look, I didn't do it, we only did it on that Friday, not for political reasons, we just wanted to get it out as soon as possible.  You buying that?  KISSEL:  No.  Nobody buys that.  And I thought the memo was frankly bizarre and very defensive in its tone.  Comey is clearly feeling pressure not just internally from the current agents working for the FBI but also from retired agents, and who knows what else.  But he, as Mary said, has very clearly damaged that agency's reputation.  MCGURN:  I agree.  Look, the situation we're in now is people not only don't believe Mrs. Clinton, they don't believe the FBI, because when you have to issue a memo like that telling people we don't play games --(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)MCGURN:  -- it's because you're playing games.  GIGOT:  It's not a good look.  MCGURN:  And I think the thing is I think that within the bureau and former agents, they all recognize this.  GIGOT:  Mary, do you think that the Bondi example neutralizes, as a political matter, and for the rest of the campaign, the Clinton problem with the e-mails of the foundation?  O'GRADY:  I don't but that doesn't surprise you.  Whether the electorate thinks so is a key question, especially these uncommitted voters who they're still trying to get.  I think the reason why Bill Clinton found it so easy to explain what he thought happened in the Bondi case because he knows how it works and he's an expert at it.  I think the magnitude of the Clinton problem is so much bigger than what happened with Trump that it's not going to be a big issue for Trump.  GIGOT:  Briefly, Mary?KISSEL:  But let's be clear, Donald Trump paid a fine.  What happened to Hillary Clinton for misusing all of this classified information?  Nothing.  GIGOT:  Maybe going to the White House.  Still ahead, U.S. intelligence officials are investigating what they say is a covert Russian plan to disrupt the American presidential election.  So should the candidates brace for an October surprise?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We know, based on our own intelligence analysis, that the Russians were behind the hack of the DNC and the providing of information for it to be disclosed from the DNC.  Every American should be concerned about Russia doing anything to try to tilt and influence our election.  (END VIDEO CLIP)PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  That was Hillary Clinton this week warning that Russia may be trying to sabotage the U.S. presidential election.  Growing evidence that Moscow was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee earlier this summer as well as breach of election systems in Illinois and Arizona has U.S. intelligence agency on high alert.  So should the candidates brace for an October surprise?  Gordon Crovitz is the ""Information Age"" columnist for the Wall Street Journal.  Welcome, Gordon.GORDON CROVITZ, INFORMATION AGE COLUMNIST:  Thank you, Paul.  GIGOT:  What do we know so far about the evidence that these were Russian hacks?  CROVITZ:  Let's first start with Russia's info war strategy generally. Stalin had something called special propaganda.  Vladimir Putin is a KGB officer, learned all about it, updated it for the digital age.  And what that entails is trying to create disillusionment and distrust in democracies about their own systems, whether it's NSA or government officials or maybe now voters.   GIGOT:  And he has tried to influence elections in Europe.  CROVITZ:  Absolutely.  He hacked, or Russians hacked the Ukrainian Election Commission, Georgia.  In the United States, we have 9,000 polling places across the country.  We have many, many systems.  We know how vulnerable every computer-generated piece of information is.  This is why there's so much concern now about what the Russians might do next.  GIGOT:  All right.  Let's take the DNC hacks first.  The public officials, the American officials are saying they think it's Russian hacks -- Russians behind it.  But they haven't laid out a trail of evidence yet.  The FBI is still investigating.  What do you think?  Do you think it was the Russians?  CROVITZ:  I think there's no doubt that it was Russians.  And it's not just the DNC.  The Russians also almost certainly have all 60,000 of Hillary Clinton's e-mails, half of which, you will recall, she turned over. Another 15,000 the FBI found.  GIGOT:  What is -- Jim Comey and the FBI said there was evidence that people tried to hack her e-mails but there's no evidence that they got in. Now, they can reverse-trace those things.  Why would you -- are you so sure that they have her e-mails?  CROVITZ:  It's much easier to reverse and determine if something has been hacked if it actually has any protection against hacking.  (LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)CROVITZ:  Her home basement service had no protection and intelligence the officials believe that many, many countries have her e-mails, certainly including the Russians.  So the Russians hacked -- got her e-mails. There's also evidence of hacking, as we discussed, the DNC, but also the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.  So Putin has at his fingertips much more information than American voters do about Hillary Clinton, about the Clinton Foundation.  If there's an October surprise relating to the e-mails, they may come from Russia.  The Russians are able to triangulate all of this information that is not available --(CROSSTALK)  GIGOT:  What it seems to me you've seen a series of public officials/Carter defense secretary, you saw the director of National Intelligence, Mr. Clapper, all point to Russian involvement.  You saw secretary Clinton in that clip saying that Russia is involved.  It sounds to me like it's almost preemptive, saying, look, if something happens in October that's who is at fault and, by the way, it's Trump's buddy.  CROVITZ:  Yeah.  GIGOT:  What do you think of that strategy on their part?  CROVITZ:  Well, I think they may have stumbled on to what is actually happening.  I think it probably is the Russians.  (LAUGHTER)Whether it is because they're trying to support Trump, I think is a different question.  The Russian strategy is to create discord and disillusionment and distrust generally.  GIGOT: Across the board.  CROVITZ:  There evidence the RNC has been hacked as well, the Republican National Committee.  So I think the Russians are an equal-opportunity disrupter in this area.  It's a separate question of whether Putin supports Trump or not.  GIGOT:  What about this issue of being able to disrupt the actual election, that is, the polling stations that you referred to?  If you think about this, we have a close election, like a Florida 2000, and the complication, additional complication of the fact that there was some -- the accusation of foreign influence, I mean, we could have a real problem here with credibility of the next president.  CROVITZ:  Yes.  The hanging chads of some years ago.  GIGOT:  Yeah.  This would be much worse.  CROVITZ:  Much worse.  And difficult to detect, and may or may not be found.  One of the issues that people are concerned about to begin with is voting from overseas, where a lot of those ballots are transmitted digitally. We'll start with that.  And then there are the 9,000 polling places.  GIGOT:  What can we do to prevent that from happening?  I'm talking about the polling place disruption?  CROVITZ:  I think it's very difficult.  I think we've come to the issue quite late in the process.  We don't really have systems in place.  As you know, even the bigger government agencies --GIGOT:  Get hacked.(LAUGHTER)CROVITZ:  -- get hacked.  Certainly, home-brew computers got hacked.  GIGOT:  So we don't want a close election.  (LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  The other thing is the response that the United States has done to hacking in the past.  All right?  We know they brought charges against a few hackers, feckless charges, in China.  We know they did almost nothing, the administration did, against North Korea for the Sony hack.  Has that been a message to the Russians that, hey -- or anybody else, hey, you know what, you can get away with it?  CROVITZ:  You know, if there's no price to be paid, why not?  I think that's what the Russians have learned so far.  GIGOT:  I think, yeah, that's a reasonable -- reasonable conclusion.  What should Obama do?  CROVITZ:  I think there has to be some steps taken.  Let's start with naming names, let's start with Obama and officially and on the record and not just unnamed officials.  Let's start with that.  But then the United States actually is pretty good at its own hacking and its own cyber activities.  Why not disclose Vladimir Putin's bank accounts? Why not the bank accounts of his cronies?  What about all the visas for the children of the cronies who don't want to live in Russia and prefer to live in the United States?  There's a lot that an administration can do to discourage this sort of Russian info war.  GIGOT:  Go on offense.  All right, Gordon, thank you for being here.  Still ahead, Libertarian Gary Johnson in the spotlight this week, but it's not necessarily for his strengths on foreign policy.  Will his serious stumble hurt him as he fights for inclusion in the first presidential debate?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT LAUER, NBC ANCHOR:  What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo?  GARY JOHNSON, LIBERTARIAN PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  About?LAUER:  Aleppo?  JOHNSON:  And what is Aleppo?  LAUER:  You're kidding.  JOHNSON:  No.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Presidential Candidate Gary Johnson taking some heat this week following that exchange on MSNBC.  The Libertarian is holding steady at 9 percent in the latest RealClearPolitics national polling average, short of the 15 percent you need to participate in the presidential debates.  But calls are growing for his inclusion, with 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeting this week, ""I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall.""  We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Anastasia O'Grady, Bill McGurn and Mary Kissel.  So, he's a noninterventionist, Gary Johnson, Mary, that's probably a good thing if you're not going intervene in Syria, if you don't know where it is or where the capitol is.  (LAUGHTER)What do you make of -- what do you make in general of Johnson?MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, COLUMNIST:  First of all, I think we should establish for the record that he's really not a Libertarian.  I mean, Johnson was a former governor of New Mexico.  He had many mainstream Republican positions.  He's in favor of gay marriage, which is not a Libertarian position.  The Libertarians say governments should not be involved in marriage.  He is in favor --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  And Mary knows Libertarians, OK?  (LAUGHTER)O'GRADY:  He is in favor of legalizing drugs, but largely because he believes that the prohibition on drugs is driving crime at the border and driving organized crime, and that's one of his big issues.  Having said all that, he is not an interventionist and, you know, that's why he got into trouble here.  I happen to think that there was something charming about the way that he responded to can question --(LAUGHTER)--- because Gary Johnson has some -- I would say a modicum of humility. And the other two candidates -- which is one reason why he's doing as well as he is in the polls, because people look at the other two candidates and they think they're actually crazy and not suited for the presidency.  (LAUGHTER)So they're looking for someone who is sort of low key, understands he doesn't know everything all the time, and can kind of take advice from experts.  GIGOT:  Dan, what do you make of Gary Johnson doing as well as he has in the polls?  And how much is this going to -- this exchange going to hurt him?  He's really desperately trying to get to 15 percent because if he can get there, or close, and he gets in the debates, that's what catapulted Ross Perot, for example, at the end of the race in 1992, the 19 percent he got.  What do you make of Johnson's chances to get there?  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR:  Well, they don't look too good. I'm of two minds on this issue, Paul.  There's a part of me that would like Gary Johnson to get on this stage because people are talking about him as an alternative.  And let's find out whether he is a credible candidate or whether, like Martin O'Malley, the failed Democratic presidential candidate, there's just nothing there.  Now, the cutoff is 15 percent, Paul.  In the RealClearPolitics average right now, he's at 9 percent.  GIGOT:  Right.  HENNINGER:  That's a long way from 15 percent.  And I would not favor just pressing Gary Johnson into the debate now because that means you would have to bring in the Green Candidate Jill Stein as well, and it would turn it into a circus.  I think four dancing elephants are more than the American people can handle right now.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  I guess the argument would be, Mary, look, Johnson to really have a chance would have to start winning some states.  And if you don't have a chance to win any states, then the election is going to come down to Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in the Electoral College.  So should the voters get that to see those two go head to head without the distraction of a third-party candidate?  MARY KISSEL, HOST, OPINION JOURNAL ON WSJ LIVE:  No, I don't think so.  I think rules are rules.  He's doing well in Utah and New Mexico and a place like Colorado.  Of course, that's a big Libertarian state, a lot of marijuana over there.  GIGOT:  They may carry Boulder.  I don't know.  KISSEL:  He may carry Boulder.  But the line is set at 15 percent.  It's set by the Commission on Presidential Debates and I --(CROSSTALK)KISSEL:  And I believe in rules.  GIGOT:  Any disagreement on that?  O'GRADY:  I disagree only in a sense that one of the big issues in this campaign has to do with government spending, and neither one of the candidates has explained how they are going to deal with this huge deficit and rising debt.  And Gary Johnson would force them to have to --BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  Interesting.O'GRADY:  --say something about that.  (CROSSTALK)MCGURN:  That's what a debate is for.  Debate is for who is likely to be president of the United States.  I think we do have rules.  15 percent --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Don't you want the issues debated though?  MCGURN:  I do want the issues debated.  But I think we do have rules and not just let -- look, the harder part for Gary Johnson is the really tough question to ask people is, who is Gary Johnson? Probably more people could identify Aleppo than a Libertarian candidate.  GIGOT:  But isn't that the point then?  If -- if the polls show, Mary, that the people are so public -- the candidate, neither, in some polls, are close to winning.  If they're so disenchant we'd the main candidates, why not give somebody like Johnson a chance on stage?  KISSEL:  Because he has no mathematical chance of winning.  The Commission on Presidential Debates, that's part of the criteria.  You have to have a mathematical road to victory.  And by the way, let's not discount the moderators here.  Do we really need Gary Johnson on the stage to have a debate about how to balance the federal budget?  (CROSSTALK)KISSEL:  Isn't that the job of the moderators?  (LAUGHTER)MCGURN:  Right.  GIGOT:  To drive the questions, you mean?  KISSEL:  To ask the hard questions.  GIGOT:  All right.  When we come back, the Obama administration's war on for-profit colleges claims its latest victim.  So is putting Bill Clinton on your payroll the key to survival for these embattled institutions?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: The Obama administration's war on for-profit colleges continues, and the latest victim, ITT Technical Institute, which shut its doors this week stranding some 43,000 students at its 137 campuses nationwide.  It's a fate that did not befall another for-profit college, Laureate International Universities, where former President Bill Clinton was paid $17.6 million between 2010 and 2015 to serve as its honorary chancellor.  ""Wall Street Journal"" editorial writer, Allysia Finley, joins us with more.  So, Allysia, you've been following this story for us.  What was the case against ITT, and was it fair?  ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL WRITER:  Right.  So ITT is a for-profit, meaning that it has shareholders.  What happened is a bunch of regulators, a creditor, a creditor, as well as the SEC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, levied a bunch of accusations, allegations that were never proven in court.  And the Department of Education used these allegations as a pretext to basically cut off federal aid to students, shutting down the college.  GIGOT:  That would seem to be a violation of due process.  I mean, do they get a chance --(CROSSTALK)FINLEY:  Is that surprising?  GIGOT:  Well, you're saying that because of the Obama administration campaign.  FINLEY:  Right.  GIGOT:  They did this against Corinthian, too.  FINLEY:  Right so this is a pattern.  GIGOT:  Was the claim that they're misusing -- abusing students who rely on loans from the federal government?  Is that -- was that the nature of the accusation?  FINLEY:  These are all very nebulous.  But ironically, the CSPB and the SEC involve private student loans.  GIGOT:  OK, that the students took out to go to the school.  FINLEY:  Right, in which case, taxpayers are not on the hook.  GIGOT: This is part of a broader campaign that the administration has had. What's motivating it?  FINLEY:  One is that these for-profit colleges provide competition for community colleges, many of which are really struggling with enrollment. And actually for-profit provide, in many cases, better programs, better suited for veterans, single mothers, non-traditional students, and that's really putting a crimp in the community colleges.  GIGOT:  Some politicians just don't like that competition for community colleges, which are public institutions?  FINLEY:  Right.  GIGOT:  And some of them are very good.  FINLEY:  Yes.  GIGOT:  But for the for-profits, some of these are online institutions, people who have to work for a living but want an extra degree, can't spend two or four years with mom and dad paying to go to school.  Right?  That's part of the attraction of some of these for-profit institutions.  FINLEY:  Right.  They serve principally low-income, minorities, a lot of veterans, and those students who are in the military.  But these schools are also not unionized.  So Democrats don't like that.  GIGOT:  That's another issue.FINLEY:  That's another.GIGOT:  What about the performance of these schools like ITT versus, say, community colleges?  Is the performance a lot worse or better or what?  FINLEY:  It depends.  It's a case-by-case basis.  But at least we know in the case of ITT that its graduation rates were, in most cases, three to four times higher than a lot of the community colleges in the nearby areas.  GIGOT:  What about their debt levels?  FINLEY:  They did graduate with higher debt levels.  But because they earned more 10 years after graduating, they are better able to pay off their debt.  GIGOT:  Interesting.  OK.  Dan, so let's turn to Bill Clinton and Laureate.  $17.6 million, that's higher than the minimum wage.  What do you make of that arrangement? And what was the relation of Laureate to the State Department and Hillary Clinton?  HENNINGER:  Well, I mean, it's just astonishing that a company like this would be paying Bill Clinton $17 million, to do what?  It was mainly to be kind of a doorman, to introduce them to --(LAUGHTER)-- to people at the State Department, connect them to institutions overseas.  They had institutions overseas.  And nothing gets made of that.  I mean, I think the underlying story here, Paul, having listened to Allysia discuss what happened to ITT and Corinthian, consider the incredible power of the federal government to literally put private companies like this out of business without any real proof that they've committed a crime at all.   What country are we living in?  I would suggest as well that if Hillary Clinton becomes president, this sort of thing is going to continue.  This is what the Democrats think -- is sort of the ideas Elizabeth Warren developed when she was head of the Consumer Financial Safety Bureau.  (CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Bill, just briefly.  MCGURN:  Yeah.  Look, I think the larger story here is ideological. Remember Mencken's line on Puritans?  We have to rewrite it.  American progressives are haunted by the idea that somebody somewhere is making a profit.  And that's what they're going to go after.  This might have been money well-spent for Laureate if it had brought them immunity from the General Obama war on private schools.  GIGOT:  All right.Thanks, Allysia.Thanks, Bill.Thanks, Dan.We have to take one more break.  When we come back, ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Time now for ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.Dan, first to you.  HENNINGER:  I'm giving my hit to Matt Lauer, the ""Today"" show host, who moderated the commander-in-chief forum.  The day afterwards, every liberal pundit in Clintonista with access to a quick Twitter account barrel-bombed and carpet-bombed --(LAUGHTER)-- Matt Lauer because he was too hard on Hillary Clinton.  So he must have been doing something right.  But if the next commander-in-chief has to be protected from Matt Lauer, she's got a big problem.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  He was just as tough on Trump, Dan, I thought.  All right, Mary.  KISSEL:  I'd like to give a hit to U.S. hockey coach, George Tortorella, for telling his players this week, quote, ""If they sit on the bench for the national anthem, they will sit there for the rest of the game,"" end quote. I think this is a good message, Paul.  It's in response to San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick's refusing to stand for the national anthem and the raising of the flag in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.  I think it goes to show, just because you can do something, it doesn't necessarily mean you should.  GIGOT:  All right, thank you, Mary.Bill?MCGURN:  A miss to a Louisiana bakery that represents the latest chapter in the ongoing wars about who gets to bake what for what ceremonies.  (LAUGHTER)This is not about marriage.  An 18-year-old Louisiana girl named McKenzie Gill (ph) went to get a cake and she wanted a flag on the back and ""Trump 2016"" on it.  The bakery refused her.  She vented on Facebook and she went and got her cake elsewhere.  So this is one young lady who bought her cake and ate it, too.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  Mary?O'GRADY:  Paul, this is a hit for the human spirit.  This is the 15th anniversary of 9/11.  And I was there on that day.  I never would have imagined what lower Manhattan looks like today.  There are 29 hotels in the neighborhood compared to six on 9/11.  There are 60,000 people living in the downtown area.  That's three times what lived there in 2000.  And last year, there were 14 million visitors to the area.  Human beings will not be defeated.  GIGOT:  Hear, hear, Mary.  Thank you.  And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us at JER on FNC.  That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel.  Thanks to all of you for watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
