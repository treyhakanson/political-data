This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight. Almost five hours of testimony from the director of the FBI is raising serious new questions about the judgment and experience of a woman who President Obama calls the most qualified person ever to run for the highest office in the land.Good evening and welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly.  For hours today on Capitol Hill, lawmakers grilled the director of the FBI over his decision not to recommend criminal charges for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over her use of a private e-mail server. And in moments, two of those lawmakers will be here. Chairman of the House Oversight Committee Congressman Jason Chaffetz will tell us why he now thinks the FBI needs to open another criminal probe of Mrs. Clinton's behavior.And Congressman Trey Gowdy will explain the legal strategy behind his fierce exchange with Director Comey. As we've made clear on this broadcast, the FBI Director does not think Mrs. Clinton committed a crime, but he does believe that she showed, quote, ""extreme carelessness in her handling of the nation's most sensitive secrets."" It is a criticism hitting directly at the heart of Mrs. Clinton's pitch to American voters.  That she is the knowledgeable, steady hand the country needs. Today Director Comey's testimony appeared to challenge some of those very claims.  Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: As a candidate for president, there's nothing I take more seriously than our national security.JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: I don't think that our investigation established that she was actually particularly sophisticated with respect to classified information.CLINTON: I have some experience with the tough calls and the hard work of statecraft.COMEY: In the one involving top-secret information, Secretary Clinton though also not only received but also sent e-mails that talked about the same subject.CLINTON: But I have a lot more experience as a senator, as secretary of state, that I am more than happy to talk about throughout this campaign.COMEY: She should have known not to send classified information. As I said, that's the definition of negligence.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: And there has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office than Hillary Clinton. Ever.COMEY: I think she was extremely careless. I think she was negligent.  That I could establish.CLINTON: I'm proud to run on my record because I think the choice before the American people in this election is clear.COMEY: Why should any person follow the law if our leaders don't? The notion that it's either prosecute or you walk around, you know, smiling all day long is just not true for those people who work for the government.  The broader question is one for democracy to answer. It's not for me.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: We begin tonight with Marc Thiessen, who's a former chief press secretary to President George W. Bush -- chief speechwriter to George W. Bush and a FOX News contributor. And Austan Goolsbee is a former adviser to President Obama and a professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.Wow, so it was quite an indictment really if you parse out what Director Comey said today, Marc, and you look back on, you know, Hillary Clinton's initial claim there. I take nothing more seriously than our national security. Your thoughts.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No, absolutely. So the whole premise of her campaign is that she has the experience, judgment, and competence to defend our national security. And Director Comey just blew those claims out of the water today. I mean, you showed the clip of her saying, that I have the experience to make the tough decisions of statecraft. Tough decisions like what? Whether to put tough secret information on an unsecured, unclassified server, that's a tough call. I mean for the American people, it's not a tough call, but apparently for Hillary Clinton it is.KELLY: Uh-hm.THIESSEN: And this is, you know, what's interesting is, is that incompetence is the only reason she is not being prosecuted. James Comey said that the reason she's not being prosecuted is because she didn't have the intent to endanger our national security. Well, that is either intent or it's incompetence. It's one of the other. It's either she knew what she was doing, in which case it's a crime, or she didn't know that it was dangerous to our national security to put top secret special access information on a private server in her basement that had less security than Gmail, in which case she's not qualified to be president of the United States.KELLY: Austan, can you take on that last point?AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO'S BOOTH SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: Well, I appreciate you having me back. I continue to think why you want legal insight from a guy with an economics PH.D. is beyond me. I doubt it's for my good looks either.KELLY: No. This isn't about legal insight. This is about, you know, him saying, Marc just put it perfectly. Either she had the intent, or she's too incompetent, you know, to be president. That's his position.GOOLSBEE: Well, that is his position. I think what you saw from Marc there is reflective of what you're seeing from some of the Republicans on these committees, what you may hear from the congressmen themselves as they come later, which is a tendency to dramatically overreach and overstate what the matters are. So if you looked at the testimony today, it's clear the lines you chose were picked -- I'm not going to say cherry-picked, but they were picked to present an argument.One of the arguments about the level of sophistication that Hillary Clinton had, had to do with, did she recognize that misclassified documents, documents that are supposed to say the level of classification on the top, according to the government's regulations, that the classification was stuck in the middle and so had she seen it. And Director Comey said that he didn't know her level of sophistication of looking for those symbols, but that a reasonable person could easily have missed it and that there were only three such e-mails that were marked classified, and they were all misclassified.KELLY: But, Austan, he also found that she was negligent, and that necessarily means she fell below the standard that would have been maintained by a reasonable person in similar circumstances. You make it sound like he said, oh, you know, poor thing. She just missed this really hard thing. No, it was Director Comey out there saying she was negligent, which was his new word today, and extremely careless. And I put that one I guess to you, Marc, because it wasn't just that Director Comey said she missed stuff that was really tough to miss. He said she missed stuff anybody would have seen. That was his point.THIESSEN: Yes, no, absolutely. In his statement yesterday, he said that it doesn't matter whether it was marked. She's the one who classifies stuff. She should know what's classified and what isn't, and there's a law she has a responsibility to know. But, again, these are not -- Austan is trying to say this is the Republicans or the congressmen are going to say this. This is not a Republican congressman. It's not me, a conservative commentator. This is Obama's director of the FBI saying the words, not just negligence, the definition of negligence. Extremely careless. Should have known better. Do those sound like the words of somebody you would trust with the nuclear codes? And Austan and I both know --GOOLSBEE: Would you feel differently Marc --THIESSEN: Austan and I both know that if either one of us when we were on the White House senior staff had done with Hillary Clinton had done, we would have been fired on the spot and we would never get a security clearance again, and if her name wasn't Clinton, neither would she.KELLY: How about that, Austan? Would you believe that? Would have been fired? Would you have been out here?THIESSEN: Would you be fired, Austan?GOOLSBEE: I was in the cabinet. I wouldn't be fired. I was in the cabinet. I received many confidential briefings. We would always get the jobs numbers the day before, and the fact is that when he's highlighted that this is about three e-mails --THIESSEN: It's not about three e-mails. It's not true.GOOLSBEE: Wait. Please let me finish.THIESSEN: Sure.GOOLSBEE: Three days ago, the Republicans said that she had classified marked e-mails on her server that contradicted her previous statements and that Director Comey had shown that she was lying. Today, Director Comey illustrated that those were only three e-mails.KELLY: Austan, you're significantly downplaying this.GOOLSBEE: And they were the lowest level of classification.KELLY: The number of -- to be charitable to her, misrepresentations. We ran through them two nights ago. There were at least eight that she said that weren't true, that she never sent or received classified information.  Not true. I mean the list -- like we could go through it again, but it's just easier to go to Facebook.com/thekellyfile. But to suggest just that one line rehabilitates her is really disingenuous.GOOLSBEE: Look, I said from the beginning on this, and what the standards are of evidence of what is the legal definition of negligence or what have you, I don't know. I do know that, A, when you look at what the Republicans are doing, they did this to Obama. They did this when they tried to impeach Clinton. And they will have a hard time if they cannot get a Republican. For Marc to call him Obama's FBI director, it's true, and he's a Republican.KELLY: He's a republican. I got to leave it at that. But I like this speaking in outline. As a former lawyer, that actually appeals to me.  Like, I can follow roman numeral one, A, B. Thank you for doing that for me.GOOLSBEE: Okay.KELLY: And it's great to see you both.THIESSEN: Thanks, Megyn.GOOLSBEE: Thanks.KELLY: So Director Comey's toughest questions seem to come from our next two guests.Up next, House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz joins us on what he thinks the FBI missed and what he wants them to do now. And Congressman Trey Gowdy reveals the secret strategy behind the fierce questions he put today to the director.Plus, Donald Trump visits Capitol Hill and it got a little ugly with a couple of senators. Charles Krauthammer and Governor Mike Huckabee are here just ahead on the fallout.And breaking tonight, growing protests in several major cities right now.  Marchers angry about two separate police shootings in the last 48 hours, both involving black suspects. And now President Obama has just weighed in. We're watching the story unfold live on a busy ""Kelly File"" tonight.  Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new fallout from the FBI director's testimony today on the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal. Moments after the hearing ended, Republicans in the Senate joined the House in launching a new push to block Mrs. Clinton and her top aides from handling any more of America's secrets, saying their behavior has, quote, ""put lives at risk."" We also heard new revelations about Mrs. Clinton's personal lawyers who went through her e-mails. Director Comey saying they lacked the security clearance to do that. And he went on to say they may have deleted classified information.Plus, the director testified that up to ten other people had access to her server without having the necessary security clearance. But one of the most talked about moments today came when Congressman Trey Gowdy confronted Director Comey with a laundry list of false statements that Mrs. Clinton has made in the course of this investigation. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TREY GOWDY, R-S.C.: Secretary Clinton said she never sent or received any classified information over her private e-mail. Was that true?COMEY: Our investigation found that there was classified information sent.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her e-mails, either sent or received. Was that true?COMEY: That's not true.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone on my e-mail. There is no classified material. Was that true?COMEY: There was classified material e-mailed.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said she used just one device. Was that true?COMEY: She used multiple devices.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said all work-related e-mails were returned to the State Department. Was that true?COMEY: No. We found work-related e-mails.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said her lawyers read every one of the e-mails and were overly inclusive. Did her lawyers read the e-mail content individually?COMEY: No.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, House Oversight Committee member Congressman Trey Gowdy.Congressman, good to see you and good for you because it takes work to actually go through the record and tick it off like that so that the American public has an understanding about what you're doing in there. And you went to the heart of it, which is what he proved -- what the FBI proved. Maybe it was a crime, maybe it wasn't, but it was absolutely that she misled over and over and over again. Your thoughts.GOWDY: Well, there's no question she made false statements to the public, but the reason I went through that exercise with Director Comey is, let's assume he's right, and there's an intent element in the statute. I think there was circumstantial evidence that she had the intent, and one way to prove circumstantial -- prove intent by circumstantial evidence is false exculpatory statements. Innocent people don't lie. So if you have a series of false statements, then you need to ask yourself while do you feel the need to mislead. It might be consciousness of guilt.KELLY: Uh-hm. And what do you think the response to that is? I mean, he's basically looking at history saying we just haven't done it, we haven't prosecuted people for gross negligence.GOWDY: You know, John Radcliff is one of my colleagues from Texas. He believes that it has been done. But let's assume Director Comey is right.  That's true with every statute until somebody decides to do it.KELLY: But should you be doing it for the first time or near the first time with somebody who is running for president? You know, it would have been pretty dicey.GOWDY: It would have been although there were other statutes he had at his disposal. I go back to the plain text. There's a reason Congress said grossly negligent. If you think that that statute is void for vagueness, it would have been a good idea to let us know sometime before today.KELLY: Mm-hmm. Do you think that he's a straight shooter? People are really going after Director Comey?GOWDY: Yes. No, I do.KELLY: Do you think politics were at play here in his decision?GOWDY: Boy, the second one is tough, but I'll tell you why. Yes, I think he's a straight shooter. I think the exact same thing about Jim Comey that I did this time last week and I will this time next week. I think he's a straight arrow. We just fundamentally disagree on that element and whether or not he could have proven intent by circumstantial evidence. Did politics influence it? I can tell you based on my previous life, it is always tougher to convict or prosecute someone who is well known.KELLY: Mm-hmm.GOWDY: It just is. He might not feel comfortable telling you that, but I will tell you that.KELLY: Do you think --GOWDY: But I don't know whether that influenced him.KELLY: Do you think there's any chance that she, Hillary Clinton, is not going to get access to, you know, top secret information, classified information as a candidate now between now and November given what she did?GOWDY: Well, you know, he was pretty clear if she worked for the FBI, she'd have some difficulties. Paul Ryan today said, deny her access. What she did, Megyn, is really unprecedented and incredibly reckless. You can't stop the president of the United States from accessing classified information, but she ain't there yet.KELLY: Mm-hmm.GOWDY: So I hope people will put the politics aside. You're talking about men and women whose political ideations we don't know anything about and who are risking their lives to gain intelligence for us, and you put it on something with less security than Gmail? Come on.KELLY: Mm-hmm. Congressman, great to see you. Thanks for being here.GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. Thank you.KELLY: Another major revelation out of today's hearing was that the FBI never investigated whether Hillary Clinton lied about her e-mails in her under-oath testimony to Congress. They said no one ever referred that to us. We never looked into whether she lied under oath. Catherine Herridge reported on our air last night that this was likely to become a major issue. And our next guest is now calling for a new FBI investigation into that very question.Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz is chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Great to see you tonight, sir.REP. JASON CHAFFETZ, R-UTAH: Thank you.KELLY: You seem surprised that he hadn't investigated that. Have you made the referral now, and do you expect the FBI to launch another investigation?CHAFFETZ: Well, I didn't know that the FBI needed a permission slip in order to see if somebody lied under oath. I really thought that that was part of the investigation. But if he needs paperwork from the House of Representatives to look at that, then we will certainly give him that. And I think Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the Judiciary, Trey Gowdy, myself, a host of other people will get on that letter if that's what he needs.KELLY: Uh-hm. And where do you see that going because they say, look, if she committed perjury in her testimony before the House by saying, I never had anything that was classified, I never sent or received classified information which we just saw in that exchange, now that was true. The bar to prove perjury is very high. I think they said six times in 60 years has anybody been convicted for perjury or even a related charge. It's really hard to prove in Congress.CHAFFETZ: Well, again, I just want the FBI to dive into it and look at it.  Based on the fact pattern that Director Comey put out there, it's clear that she misled the public. But it's a whole different level when you come to Congress, you raise your right hand and you affirm under oath that what you're saying is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and then the FBI finds that those items are false.KELLY: Can you --CHAFFETZ: There should be a consequence for that as well.KELLY: Can you explain why the hearings today were necessary, right? Last night on the air we were talking about, why don't you just take what you got from Director Comey, all the lies and so on, and go with it? Why rake him over the coals about not taking the extra step?CHAFFETZ: Well, look, we learned a lot more about this problem and the pervasiveness. You know, the second panel, we actually exposed the fact that these classified e-mails have such a high classification, not even members of Congress, not even as chairman of the Oversight Committee do I have the necessary security clearance to look at those. And yet we heard for the very first time from Director Comey that there were up to ten people that had access to this information. So it's gone beyond just that server. They were now -- this classified information in a non-secure setting with people who did not have the adequate security clearances.KELLY: Will anything happen to her as a result of this? Forget politics.  The voters will decide in November. But what could happen to her because of this?CHAFFETZ: Well, I mean, literally just a short time ago, the State Department has now announced that they've reopened their investigation not only to Secretary Clinton, but to the employees within the State Department. We want people to be held accountable, but we've also got to fix this because classified information is there for a reason. It puts people's lives in danger.KELLY: Uh-hmm.CHAFFETZ: It opens up our nation to severe consequences, and she created this herself. It wasn't Republicans. It wasn't -- she did this to herself. She did it to this nation, and we've got to go back and try to repair it.KELLY: Uh-hm. And then when you started looking into it and the media also did --CHAFFETZ: Yes.KELLY: Everyone was dismissed as absurd. Absurd. Congressman Jason Chaffetz, always a pleasure. Great to see you.CHAFFETZ: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: But we also have new fallout tonight from what became a contentious meeting between presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and some Republicans in Congress today. The details of what happened behind closed doors with Dr. Charles Krauthammer and Governor Mike Huckabee, next.Plus hundreds of protesters are marching through New York, Philadelphia, and Atlanta tonight at this hour, angry about two police shootings in the last 48 hours. We have live pictures for you here. Look at this. Look at Times Square tonight, where we are told everything is shut down. The protesters are chanting about racist cops. We'll show you what President Obama said about all of this just ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: To be concerned about these issues is not political correctness. It's just being American.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER: From the World Headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: Well, we are getting new reaction tonight to a series of reportedly tense meetings on Capitol Hill between Donald Trump and some key GOP members of the House and Senate. Including his former rival for the nomination, Senator Ted Cruz. Dr. Charles Krauthammer is here with his take on a day that's already been billed as controversial. And Governor Mike Huckabee joins us with the latest on the criticisms Trump is getting for what was said at those meetings.But first campaign Carl Cameron reports from Washington. Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Megyn.  Trump met privately first of all with about 200 House Republicans then separately with Senate Republicans and got mixed reviews after both of the meetings. A number of Trump backers were quick to say it was a great speech and a wonderful meeting, but there were also plenty who said it was a stream of consciousness rant like any of his rallies and lots of hyperbole and not a lot of facts or policy. Arizona Senator Jeff Flake actually confronted Trump for having said, fellow Arizona Senator John McCain was not a war hero almost a year ago.Trump recognized Flake as a major critic almost immediately, particularly on trade, and according to those in the room, Trump threatened to defeat Flake for re-election, who reminded him he's not up for re-election until 2018. Then there was Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska. He actually did go to the meeting, though he is a staunch Trump opponent. And afterwards his spokesman said nothing's change. Sasse believes the country is in a bad place with Trump and Clinton as the candidates and the election remains in his words a dumpster fire.Having said that, House Speaker Paul Ryan who has been critical of Trump said it was a good meeting and Trump did a great job engaging members of Congress and made it clear that he wants to work with him. That's a big deal. And finally, just former rival Ted Cruz, he meet privately with Trump this morning and says Trump asked him to speak at the convention and he agreed. He said Trump also asked for advice on judicial appointments and Cruz offered to help. But there was no discussion of endorsement, which obviously Trump would like but didn't ask for -- Megyn.KELLY: Carl, thank you. As Carl just mentioned, Senator Ted Cruz held a meeting with Mr. Trump today. Just a little over two months after Senator Cruz said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: I tell you what I really think of Donald. This man is a pathological liar. He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth.  Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and goes, dude, what's your problem? The man is utterly amoral. Morality does not exist for him. It's why he went after Heidi directly and smeared my wife.  Donald will betray his supporters on every issue.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now with more, nationally syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer. Charles, great to see you.So, let's just start with Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz, who the last day of the primary came out and just annihilated Trump, saying, I'm going to tell you what I really think of him. And then, you know, just spewed the most hateful, vile things he could think of. And now we're supposed to listen to him speak at the convention like he's some credible witness for Trump's presidency?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think this is exactly what Trump began his campaign by campaigning against this kind of obvious insincerity one way or the other. But perhaps on both sides, for Cruz, this is a guy who said I don't know if I could ever support somebody who insulted my wife the way that Trump did. On the other hand, Trump had intimated that he wouldn't allow Cruz to speak at the convention unless he was endorsed. So I think these counts as some kind of compromise and kind of a plus for Trump in getting Cruz at least nominally on board and perhaps he'll get his endorsement eventually.  KELLY: Hmm. I wonder how the women of America are going to react to Ted Cruz getting up there and saying, you know, good things about the man who insulted Ted Cruz's own wife and her appearance.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, I'm not sure that Cruz endeared himself to the women or the men of America preceding this event. I mean he's a staunch conservative, and his appeal was ideological. I'm not sure it ever was personal.KELLY: Politics is so weird or as Stirewalt calls it, grody. Let's talk about how Trump did today because there were mixed reports about the things he said, and some of the feathers he ruffled when he was on Capitol Hill, in particular all over the Senate. Your thoughts.KRAUTHAMMER: I think it's the same Achilles' heel he's had all the way through. When he stays away from personal stuff, his being offended, not being respected enough, not being given the proper homage -- the way he went after Governor Susana Martinez of New Mexico, completely gratuitously, really self-destructively.It didn't help him. As long -- when he stays away from, that he does okay. His issues are very appealing. The populist appeal on both immigration and trade, and when he talks policy, which I assume, according to Speaker Ryan, he mostly did in with the House members, he did reasonably well.But in the Senate, he wanted to pick a bone with those who haven't bended a knee to him, including, as we just heard, Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake. And that led to an embarrassing encounter where Trump appeared to obviously not even know that Flake isn't even up for re-election.KELLY: And flake, you know, with the opening line to Trump said, ""Yes, I'm the other senator from Arizona, the one who didn't get captured. And I want to talk to you about statements like that."" It did not go well. And then Trump apparently told, you know, instead of Senator Mark Kirk who's not supporting him called him a loser, and, you know...KRAUTHAMMER: And Ben Sasse.KELLY: It was never going to go well with Ben Sasse, who thinks it was a dumpster fire. But what of the misstatement of the constitution, you know, that he really likes Article 12 and of course there is no article 12.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, given the -- if you want to give him the benefit of the doubt and I'll leave it up to you and the viewers, you can say that he just mistook article for amendment. So he was thinking -- he was asked would you defend Article 1, which means the powers of Congress.Assuming that he misinterpreted that to mean the first amendment, so he goes on to 12, et cetera, amendments. But it does tell you that we are dealing with a candidate whose lack of knowledge, lack of preparedness in terms of the fundamentals of government is quite breathtaking.KELLY: Charles Krauthammer, great to see you, sir.KELLY: My pleasure.KELLY: Joining me now with more, Governor Mike Huckabee. Governor, great to see you. So, what do you make of Ted Cruz? ""Trump is utterly immoral. He's a pathological liar. I'm Ted Cruz. Welcome to the Trump convention.""MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well, let me tell you something, one of the reasons you don't say that kind of stuff during a primary is that one of two things will happen. You will be the nominee, and all the people that you said, that you know, you're talking about have got to come up there and put their arms on you, or you've got to go up there and put your arms around the people you said were a bunch of bums.If you're the Democrats, you're going to beat the daylights out of a guy like that. You're going to say, ""Okay, quit (inaudible) your lines when you said this or when you said this.KELLY: Well, how is anybody supposed to take him seriously when he gets up there? And what's he going to say? Donald Trump is the man for us! The most he could do credibly would be something sort of weak softly, like better than Hillary and who needs that at the convention?HUCKABEE: Or he can just go up there and say, I've seen the light, dear Jesus. I'm now going to be there with Donald Trump.KELLY: Oh, please.HUCKABEE: But no, it's disingenuous no matter what and it's really...KELLY: Thank God for Ohio.HUCKABEE: That's it. And it's a very awkward thing. So, I think the longer you're in politics, the more you're careful about saying things that you're going to have to eat later with syrup on top of it.KELLY: What do you make of the conduct of some of these senators in this meeting? Trump goes to Capitol Hill. He didn't have to do it. He's trying to unite the party. These people, they don't like him. They give him a hard time like, you know, Ben Sasse is not a Trump fan. Why bother? You, know, why show up to give him a hard time?HUCKABEE: You know, I guess to get some attention because we're talking about him tonight. But look, here's the fact, if Donald Trump is president, I think he likely will be, but I hope he is. It will be a bad place for Jeff Flake to be in two years not because he will have his election upended by Donald Trump.It probably won't be that big og an effect, but when Senator Flake needs something for Arizona, he ain't going to get it. And I'm going to tell you something, presidents can play hardball and can punish the people who didn't want to stand up there with him.KELLY: How?HUCKABEE: Do you think there'll ever be an appointment to West Point, Annapolis or the Air Force Academy that will come through his office? Do you think there'll ever be a grant with his name on it that he'll ever be invited to make the dedicatory speech out of Rhode (ph)? I mean, I'm telling you, there are ways that are painful.KELLY: You can get punished.HUCKABEE: And you never get just -- even so much as a White House pass for some tourists from your state.KELLY: Are we going to hear from you at this convention?HUCKABEE: Donald Trump told me a few weeks ago that he would like for me to speak. I don't know when. I don't know if it's going to be at 2:00 in the morning while their crew is setting up.KELLY: That's just a little offensive.HUCKABEE: I just don't know. But I'd like to know pretty soon because I need to be working on it.KELLY: Hey, Trump, 9:00 p.m. would be a great time for Governor Huckabee. We'd love to see him.HUCKABEE: Let's do it. I'm all about it.KELLY: Great to see you sir.HUCKABEE: Thanks Megyn.KELLY: So, our control room is right now watching some angry protests in at least four American cities. Times Square is, I mean they are in trouble tonight in terms of the numbers. It's just lockdown there. Big crowds in New York. Big crowds in Dallas.Marchers chanting about, ""Racist cops"" after two black men were killed by police officers in separate incidents less than 24 hours apart. Mark and Arthur, you're next. And then we'll bring you the breaking news from the president on all of this. Stay tuned.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, protesters are gathering across the country after the second black man in less than 24 hours was shot and killed by a police officer. The new case came in Minnesota, where Philando Castile was shot during a routine traffic stop. The aftermath of the shooting was captured and live streamed on Facebook. Listen to Castile's girlfriend narrate what happened just moments before.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Stay with me. We got pulled over for a busted taillight in the back, and the police just -- he's -- he's covered. He killed my boyfriend. He's licensed -- he's carrying -- he's licensed to carry. He was trying to get out his I.D. and his wallet out of his pocket, and he let the officer know that he was -- he had a firearm, and he was reaching for his wallet. And the officer just shot him in his arm.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hand off it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He had -- you told him to get his I.D. sir, his driver's license. Oh, my God, please don't tell me he's dead.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Mike Tobin is in Minneapolis with the very latest. Mike?MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: All right Megyn, we're watching the demonstrators. A group of them just splintered off and went off marching but hundreds remain in front of the Governor's mansion here in St. Paul. They really have been at it all day and all night since the shooting. No indication of any trouble. This has been a very peaceful demonstration and Governor Dayton has been very sympathetic with them, saying that this latest police-involved fatality is evidence of racism.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. MARK DAYTON, D-MINN.: Would this have happened if those passengers, the driver or the passenger were white? I don't think it would have. So I'm forced to confront and I think all of us in Minnesota are forced to confront this kind of racism exists.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN: It was just around 9:00 last night when Philando Castile was driving through the Falcon Heights suburb of St. Paul. According to his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, he was pulled over for a broken taillight. He disclosed that he had a weapon and a permit for that weapon, but when he went for his license and registration according to Reynolds, the police officer opened fire.Now, Reynolds explained why she didn't render aid. She said she thought she would be fired upon if she suddenly lunged across Castile and tried to help him. She said that she uploaded the whole thing to Facebook because she thought police ultimately would try to cover up the evidence. But that live stream captured one heart breaking image, or heart breaking sound, I should say, of a little girl in the back seat who saw the whole thing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's okay, mommy.DIAMOND REYNOLDS, CASTILE'S GIRLFRIEND: I can't believe they just did this. I'm (bleep).UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's okay. I'm right here with you.TOBIN: Now, Castile worked with the St. Paul school district since 2002 in food preparation. He recently had been promoted to supervisor at a local Montessori school. He said he was kind and respectful. That's what people said about him. He did have a record but mostly misdemeanors, nothing violent. Megyn?KELLY: Mike, thank you. Our legal panel is here with more. Arthur Aidala is a New York trial attorney and a Fox News legal analyst. Mike Eiglarsh is a criminal defense attorney former prosecutor. Wow, I mean, that sound of the daughter is heart breaking, and underscores the human element of this, right?It's like we jump into these legal debates and you skim right over the human element of what happened. Anyway, it's -- it's hard to watch, and yet that doesn't answer the question about whether what we saw on that tape is illegal or, as the governor said, racist. I'll start with you on it, Mark.MARK EIGLARSH, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: I'm not prepared to make any conclusions at all. He may be right. He may be wrong too. I say let's wait until all the evidence is in, and then we'll know through a legal lens whether this officer reasonably feared death or great bodily harm, which is the legal standard. Since we don't have all the evidence yet, why not just wait?KELLY: The thing is Arthur, something important is missing on that tape, which is -- we saw the aftermath, but we didn't see the prelude.ARTHU AIDALA, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Right, and that's why this officer, unlike the officers in Baton Rouge, where you kind of see the beginning, middle, and end of that encounter, this officer at least would have the opportunity of presenting his perception of what took place. I just want to say, Megyn, I'm a little frazzled because I just walked through the protest to come here, through, you know, Times Square and Fifth Avenue is totally closed off.It's just ironic to watch white police officers, black police officers, Asians, and Hispanic police officers protecting the people on the streets screaming, ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, these racist cops have got to go."" And although they make a point, you then see the New York City police, which is every color of the rainbow, protecting these people who are screaming almost in their faces. It's just -- it's unsettling. I apologize. It's unsettling to say the least.KELLY: I know. And there are real consequences to categorizing all cops as racist too. I mean, we've seen the consequences of that. According to the head of the FBI in various cities, people -- you know, we need to be careful in the wake of these events. But, Mark, can I just ask you about the girlfriend?Everyone is talking about the girlfriend, live streaming the event. We heard the explanation from Mike Tobin, but why wasn't she -- I mean she says he's dead, and he wasn't dead at that point. Like I'm not saying 911 could have gotten there, but what the...EIGLARSH: I am so glad you brought that up. Look, I don't know how I'd react under similar circumstances. I'd like to think that live streaming the event as my loved one is in pain, still alive, is the last thing that I would do.AIDALA: Okay, but...EIGLARSH: I'm glad we have something on video, but the cop also stood there. It didn't look like he was rendering aid. Again, I don't have all the facts, but that troubled me.AIDALA: But you also hear the police officer scream at her shortly thereafter in the middle of it, don't move. Let me see your hands. Don't move. And she said I was afraid if I approached my loved one, you know, he was going to shoot me as well and...EIGLARSH: Arthur, you got a phone. Call 911.KELLY: Let's just listen in for a second. Let's listen one second to what's happening in Times Square. Let's listen in if we can.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE/UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace is what we're hearing tonight. As you can see, just tempers and tensions are inflamed over this issue. And the thing is, Mark, whether this was a racist cop who shot this guy or not, we've seen so many of these, you know? Is it that more are happening or is it that more cameras are there?EIGLARSH: Well, we're certainly seeing more of them. And like every plane crash, you think that it's happening a lot more frequently than it might be. I like this. It doesn't mean that I agree with what's being said one way or another. But peaceful protests, that's what this country was founded upon. Go right ahead. Get it out as long as it's peaceful.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But to go directly to the racist place, Arthur, you know, I understand the skin colors of those people involved, but to go directly to...EIGLARSH: Their rights.KELLY: Their right, Mark?EIGLARSH: It is a right. Listen, the first amendment allows people to spew (ph) outrageous and offensive...KELLY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's no question they can say it. But I'm saying to you, Arthur, that to go directly -- Jesse Jackson was on the program last night going right to that -- these cops are racist...EIGLARSH: Oh yeah, I wouldn't got there (ph).AIDALA: Well, look, I think what the governor said was if that was a white person in there reaching for their wallet, this police officer wouldn't shoot at that person. The problem is and I guess everyone is afraid to say it, is that statistically speaking in this country, that a person of color is more likely to have that weapon than a person -- than a Caucasian.You know, I know that's not the right thing to say, but that's what the statistics bear out. So, therefore, it plays a role. Wasn't it Jesse Jackson who also said, if I turn around and I see a person of color behind me, I get more nervous than if I turn around and see a white person behind me? I think it was Jesse Jackson.EIGLARSH: Yeah, it was. It was.AIDALA: This whole thing stinks.KELLY: We have much more that we need to cover with you guys. We mentioned Baton Rouge, we haven't gotten into that yet and things are getting tense in Times Square. We're going to hold the panel over and Kevin Jackson is with us after the break. I'm sorry, Eric Guster is with us right after the break. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, the situation here in Times Square just steps away from our studios. This is right behind us. You can hear Arthur Aidala talk about his trip here to Fox News moments ago where folks are out on the streets protesting in the wake of this situation in Minnesota.Another situation in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, involving the shooting of two black men by white police officers in circumstances that looked questionable but have not yet been resolved by those looking into it. Let's just take a listen for a minute.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE/UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hands up, don't shoot. Hands up, don't shoot. Hands up, don't shoot.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: You can see the sign, ""We will not be silent."" And the president of the United States was not silent either. He came out and commented today. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: When people say black lives matter, that doesn't mean blue lives don't matter, it just means all lives matter. But right now, the big concern is the fact that the data shows black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents.To be concerned about these issues is not political correctness. It's just being American.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And we're watching -- let's take a look. Let's just keep our eye on it so we know what's happening there. So far the protest appears mostly peaceful where you can hear the messages, although the messages are incendiary, accusing the cops as a whole of being racist. And as our panel points out, you've got many, many police officers of color in the crowd tonight.I want to bring back in our panel, Mark and Arthur are still with me along with attorney Eric Guster. Eric, we haven't heard from you on this. Your take as we watch the anger in the streets. And just the -- I mean so far its respectful anger, but the charges of racism before we know all the facts.ERIC GUSTER, ATTORNEY: Well, the facts that we do know is that black men or black individuals are three times more likely to be stopped by police, two times more likely to be shot by police. And that's why these people are here protesting. And Megyn, the most beautiful thing about this protest is that that audience, the people out there marching, are at least 50 percent white. New York is a melting pot of the United States.It has all types of nationalities, all types of people, and this is an American problem just like what President Obama said. This is an American problem and Americans are out there together to combat this issue because it's such a reality in so many communities of color and communities involving poor people.KELLY: Look, we don't have a police officer on the panel tonight or a former police officer. But as former prosecutors, you guys have spent a lot of time with cops, and the thing is it always feels a little discomfiting to be armchair quarterbacking these incidents in the moment, Mark. You know, it's like it's easy for us sitting in the anchor studio to say, ""Well, he never should have drawn his gun and shot that man,"" but these guys put their lives on the line every day.EIGLARSH: Yeah, I agree. We start the analysis or I do anyway with these officers didn't wake up wanting to kill anyone that day. So what happened? What led them down the path that they felt fear and believed that their life was in danger enough to pull the trigger? I've got to hear what they have to say before I make any conclusion.KELLY: And yet, Arthur, in the case in Minnesota, the allegations are that he was pulled over. He was asked for his license and registration. He said he had a gun, and according to, you know, his girlfriend, that was to tell them, hey, I got a gun on me. I mean, that's what she seems to be suggesting. And the next thing you know, he's shot.Now, I understand you might be fearful. He's reaching for his pocket. He's saying he has a gun. But, you know, what obligation do the cops have to beware of the trigger finger, the itchy trigger finger?AIDALA: Well, look, let's just start off with saying the Department of Justice, I believe in both of these cases, in Baton Rouge, the prosecutor there, the local prosecutor has agreed to hand it over to the Federal authorities to investigate it.I believe the same thing is going to happen in Minnesota. So, you're going to have the FBI looking into this. And one of the things they're going to look at, touching on what you just said, is what are the proper procedures? What are the -- I don't know, people are running there.KELLY: Yeah, they're running.AIDALA: What is a police officer supposed to do? What does the patrol guide say? But, you know, I want to touch for a second...KELLY: This is Dallas, Texas we're watching here.AIDALA: ...what the president of the United States said, the president of the United States said that black people are more vulnerable to these -- these shootings by police officers. The next question I want to ask the president of the United States, as the first black president, is why? Can we figure out why? Why is it?Is it just because of the color of someone's skin or is it based on other things besides that? And I would hope post-presidency that president Obama will focus on the black community and relieving them of this horrible situation that they seem to find themselves.KELLY: What of that, Eric, because you started off with statistics on, you know, the risk to black men when it comes to their encounters with police. An you heard Arthur's retort which is, well, there could be a non-racist explanation for that.GUSTER: But there is -- a lot of this is systematic, Megyn. It goes back to education and the school system and job opportunities because when you have lack of opportunities, then people turn to do something else. But this is a systematic issue with our criminal justice system, with our education system and it is a major failure for so many African-Americans and people who are poor as well.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: FYI, we're trying to watch what's happening in Dallas, Texas. We've seen protests in many locations. Did we lose the feed there? We're trying to -- we're keeping our eyes on it for you. In Times Square, you can see its calm, but very, very crowded. This looks like -- this looks like New Year's Eve in Times Square where we get over a million people.And this news just broke today. I mean these folks got out, and they got out fairly quickly to make their voices heard. Go ahead. You were saying, Arthur.AIDALA: I was saying I agree with everything he just said -- Eric just said. I do think it's systematic, et cetera, et cetera, and it needs to be dealt with and that's what I hope the president of the United States will deal with post-presidency.But talking about the police officers and why those police officers are reacting or overreacting or reacting in a ridiculous manner looking at it in hindsight is that because people of color, for whatever reasons, are the ones who have the higher percentage of violence in their background. I think that's statistically a fact. At least it is in New York.KELLY: All right. Look, we're looking back in Dallas, Texas. This is disturbing. This is -- I'm not sure what we're seeing, but it looks from this vantage point like an officer down. We're not sure. We are not sure. This is my speculation as I look at the screen. Stand by on that. I don't know what I'm seeing. This is the control room trying to tell me. They have a better vantage point, so I'm sorry for the speculation. The police are working on --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God.   KELLY: That's -- I mean, we're all seeing this together. This is not clear.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/10/07/fallout-from-leaked-trump-audio-from-2005/	Fallout from leaked Trump audio from 2005	"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" October 7, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST:  And welcome this Friday night to ""Hannity.""And this is a ""Fox News Alert,"" breaking news tonight about the 2016 campaign.  New audio was leaked of Donald Trump talking about women on a hot mike back in 2005.  Also tonight, Wikileaks has released damning new material about Hillary Clinton and her campaign.  Now, parts include excerpts of her Wall Street speeches.  We're going to get to all that in just a moment.But first, Hurricane Matthew continues to make it way up the Eastern Seaboard.  It is still a powerful Category 2 hurricane.And joining us now on the ground in Savannah, Georgia, is Rob Schmitt.   Rob, what's going on?ROB SCHMITT, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Sean, dumping (ph) rain, some powerful wind coming through, but the worst is not here yet, the eye of that storm probably still about 70 miles to our south, but moving in this direction.And as you know, as we've seen today, the storm hasn't been as bad as we thought because that eye still has not touched the United States.  That could happen here in Savannah or maybe to my north in Charleston.Right here, on I'm River Street here in Savannah.  We're down by the water. This is as close to sea level as we're going to get.  That's the Savannah River across the way in South Carolina.In Savannah right now, there is a mandatory evacuation under way anywhere east of I-95.  That's about a 20-mile stretch to the water.  There's about 100,000 people in the state of Georgia without power at this point.And what we're really concerned about tonight, Sean, is the fact that this storm appears to be moving into this direction and the eye could be hitting Savannah and surrounding areas right at the same time as high tide, and that's around 2:00 o'clock in the morning.So water, as it usually is with these storms, could be the most dangerous, the most deadly factor in this storm, not always wind, but this time water. Where I'm standing could be completely under water in just a matter of hours.HANNITY:  All right, Rob.  Thank you.And joining us now is Fox News chief meteorologist.  Rick Reichmuth is with us.  Rick, what's going on?RICK REICHMUTH, FOX METEOROLOGIST:  Hey, Sean.  Still hurricane warnings in effect for northern parts of Florida, although I think you're going to be getting a little bit better, getting some offshore winds.  But Georgia still, South Carolina, North Carolina under the gun here.We're about 36 hours in.  We have about 36 hours to go before this storm is completely gone.  And the rainfall totals are going to be extreme once it moves towards the north, worse than it was across areas of Florida.And so take a look at this, a widespread area around 10 inches of rain, and we'll see some isolated spots about 15 inches.  We had incredible flooding in North Carolina about two weeks ago, and that ground is saturated, the rivers are still full, and 10 inches of rain on top of that will be catastrophic.Storm surge is going to be extreme around Charleston, and at this point, we're expecting to see the second biggest storm surge ever in Charleston, right behind Hurricane Hugo, and that is saying something.Winds still at 120 miles an hour.  The pressure is still low means there's just an incredibly strong storm that is still here.  We have the rain to go.  We have the wind to go.The worst wind we've seen is just over 100 miles an hour that we saw in Florida.  And Rob is right, the storm stayed about 20 miles offshore, and that certainly spared us from the worst of the wind.  But we still have a lot of storm surge to go, especially across this coastal area that is especially prone to storm surge.Overnight tonight, towards tomorrow morning, the center of the storm again getting very close to land, likely around the Charleston area.  But take a look at how heavy this rain is.  For Saturday we have it.  It's gone in South Carolina by the evening.  But take a look at that, Sean.  It is about midday Sunday finally before this storm is completely off the Eastern Seaboard.HANNITY:  All right, Rick.  Thank you.  We'll continue to bring you live updates on Hurricane Matthew all throughout the program.But first, earlier today, The Washington Post released audio of Donald Trump from 2005.  He was caught on a hot mike while speaking with then host of ""Access Hollywood"" Billy Bush, now, right before he was to make a cameo on a soap opera.  Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I moved on her, and I failed. I'll admit it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Whoa!TRUMP:  I did try and (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  She was married.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP:  She wanted to get some furniture.  I said, I'll show you where they have some nice furniture.  I took her out furniture -- I moved on her like (EXPLETIVE DELETED), but I couldn't get there.  And she was married.  And all of a sudden, I see her.  She's now got the big phony (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  I mean, she's totally changed her look.I got to use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her.  You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them.  It's like a magnet, kiss, kiss.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP:  (INAUDIBLE) and when you're a star, they let you do it.  You can do anything.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Whatever you want.TRUMP:  Grab them by the (EXPLETIVE DELETED)(LAUGHTER)TRUMP:  You can do anything.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, after the tape was released, Donald Trump put out a statement.  It read, quote, ""This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago.  Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course, not even close.  But I apologize if anyone was offended.""Joining us now tonight with reaction, Fox News contributor Monica Crowley, the host of ""Justice,"" Judge Jeanine Pirro.All right, I can't -- nobody's going to defend this.  You can't defend -- it is wrong.  It is inappropriate.  It is outrageous.  I don't think anybody's going to argue with that.  Here's -- and you know what it is?  It is locker room, sounded like a lot of bragaddocio.Paul Ryan pulled out.  Reince Priebus said no woman should ever be described in these terms. Mitt Romney, of course, Jeb Bush of course, Senator Flake, of course.  And I -- you don't make excuses.  When you think something's wrong, it's wrong.Here is where we get into, I think. a very important question in this campaign right now because the media by and large, and people in the media and people out in the public, they don't know about Juanita Broaddrick, who claimed she was raped.  They don't know about Kathleen Willey, who claims she was groped and grabbed and fondled and kissed against her will.  They don't know that Paula Jones was paid an $850,000 settlement because then Arkansas attorney general, Bill Clinton, exposed himself, which is beyond perverted.And when Hillary tweeted out tonight, ""This is horrific.  We cannot allow this man to become president,"" I tweeted back, ""Well, why selective moral outrage?  Where were you when Juanita spoke out and Kathleen spoke out and Paula spoke out?""Now, I know some people in the audience are going to say, Hannity, you're defending Trump.  No, I think what he said is outrageous, inappropriate, wrong, and demeaning even.JEANINE PIRRO, ""JUSTICE"" HOST:  Well, you know, he apologized.HANNITY:  He did.PIRRO:  And that was the right thing to do it.  It is -- it is offensive, it is insulting, it is demeaning, all that language.  But here's the thing, Sean...HANNITY:  Wait.  Here's the thing...PIRRO:  When he got off...HANNITY:  He said words.PIRRO:  That's where I'm going.HANNITY:  But Clinton's actions...PIRRO:  He not only said words, she has done things that were illegal and she now -- and I think the Department of Justice...HANNITY:  Well, let's stay on this topic, though.PIRRO:  ... has to reopen.HANNITY:  Let's stay...PIRRO:  OK, he gets off the bus.  The proof is in the pudding.  For all that banter between two high schoolers on a bus -- he gets off the bus for this woman who's so gorgeous, he gives her an air kiss!  Nobody's grabbing anybody!  Nobody's touching anybody!  Nobody's a voyeur (ph)!HANNITY:  Listen, it was locker room talk...PIRRO:  It was -- it was...HANNITY:  ... granted.PIRRO:  ... shameful 11 years ago!  The man was in -- he was in entertainment!  He was in theater!  I don't excuse it!  I think it's horrific!But when you juxtapose words against the actions of a woman who sold arms to ISIS, against the actions of a woman whose life (ph) was going to destroy the women who were victimized by her husband...HANNITY:  I want to stay -- I want to stay focused for a second here because, yes, those words were wrong and outrageous.  I think we all agree here.  Now, what he said was wrong.  Now we have then president of the United States in the Oval Office with an intern, and oral sex was performed and a cigar was used.We're going to have this national discussion.  Let's have it.  I mean -- whoa, whoa!  I'm not holding back.  And exposing himself to a woman and accused of rape by a woman and grabbing a woman -- those were behaviors! Is there a double standard for Republicans that have standards and Democrats that have none because they all defended Bill Clinton?MONICA CROWLEY, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, of course, Sean.  Of course. That's just a truism for any Republican running for any office ever!  I knew watching that first presidential debate, when Mrs. Clinton at the very end of the debate dumped the Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, on Donald Trump-- I knew that that was the first salvo from her massive opposition research file against Donald Trump!  And you know that this is the next one, and there are many, many more to come that she has against him.So here's the question.  It's not what she's got against Donald Trump that they are selectively leaking now day by day.  It's how Donald Trump is going to react to this.HANNITY:  I want to get to that in a second...CROWLEY:  I agree with Jeanine that the...HANNITY:  But I want to stay focused here...CROWLEY:  ... apology was appropriate.  But he's got to...HANNITY:  What do you think he ought to do?CROWLEY:  ... pivot this around to what you're saying about actions versus words.  And also, in the next debate, Sean, Sunday night, if she raises this issue, he should say, You know what?  This country has very serious problems.  I understand you have to reach back 11 years to try to find something to smear me with, but the American people want concrete solutions to our problems...HANNITY:  But you see, I think Hillary saying this...CROWLEY:  ... and I'm here to offer them!HANNITY:  I think Hillary saying, ""This is horrific.  We cannot allow this man to be president"" -- now, wait a minute.  Hillary Clinton is quoted by one of her close friends as calling Monica Lewinsky, the intern, a narcissistic looney tune.  The surrogates of the Clintons went out there and said Paula Jones -- you drag a dollar through a trailer park -- a lot of horrible things were said here.So I guess my question is -- I've interviewed, for example, Juanita, Kathleen and Paula.  Here's just two of these women.  Let's watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  You described the scene where he was biting on your lip, and then when it was all over and he was leaving, said, You better put some ice on that.JUANITA BROADDRICK, ACCUSER:  Yes, and casually put on his sunglasses and walked out the door.  And I've told my friend, who came back and found me, that I was sitting there crying and so upset at the time, and I felt like somebody -- that the next person would be somebody coming through the door to get rid of the body.KATHLEEN WILLEY, ACCUSER:  It was a terrible ordeal for me.  And I -- no woman should be subjected to it.  It was assault.HANNITY:  He assaulted you.WILLEY:  Yes.HANNITY:  He -- and you -- he touched, grabbed, fondled...WILLEY:  Yes.HANNITY:  ... and kissed you...WILLEY:  Yes.HANNITY:  ... against your will.WILLEY:  Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Juanita once tweeted, ""I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Arkansas attorney general, raped me.  Hillary tried to silence me.  I'm now 73.  It never goes away.""Now, OK?  I'll sit here tonight and say what Donald Trump said is absolutely inappropriate, wrong, locker talk, demeaning even.Are we now going to have a discussion as a nation -- if we really care about the issue, the treatment of women, are we now going to have that discussion, which the media has never asked Hillary this campaign about Juanita.  They never asked about Kathleen.  They never asked about Monica, the narcissistic looney tune.They never asked about any of -- these are assaults, except in the case of Monica Lewinsky.  So if Hillary tweets, ""This is horrific.  We can't allow this man to become president,"" why did she sit silent when her husband was doing this in the White House?CROWLEY:  Well, let's be really clear.  Bill Clinton is not on the ballot, Mrs. Clinton is.  It is not about Bill Clinton's infidelities.  Very few people care whether...HANNITY:  But she's criticizing Donald Trump.CROWLEY:  The question is...HANNITY:  She didn't criticize her husband.CROWLEY:  ... about the allegations of rape and sexual assault, not about adultery with Bill Clinton.  And the question is because Mrs. Clinton is on the ballot, what was her role in smearing and destroying the women who were involved with her husband and/or accused him of these serious crimes?That's the question.  So if she wants to raise the women's issue, that's how Donald Trump should answer.HANNITY:  If what Donald Trump said is wrong, and we're agreeing he said -- what he said is wrong, is it -- was it wrong for her to refer to Monica Lewinsky as a narcissistic looney tune?PIRRO:  She called them bimbos, all of them!HANNITY:  That was a ""bimbo eruption.""PIRRO:  Yes, the bimbo eruptions.  She had a team that was out to destroy them!  There is a difference between the penal law, sexual assault, rape, you know, and words that are not...HANNITY:  All right...PIRRO:  ... in effect, doing anything to any other human being!(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Let's take this a step further.  There was a child rape victim.PIRRO:  Ah, the pedophile!HANNITY:  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hillary Clinton -- we have the tape of her -- long before she really got into the world of politics, she defended a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl.  She got the girl -- she got the rapist off.What's interesting -- we're about to play a tape where Hillary pretty much acknowledges she thought the guy was guilty.  And listen how -- he took a lie detector test and passed that forever, you know, changed my view that lie detector tests work, and laughs afterwards!Now, we're going to have this really important discussion about Donald Trump's comments.  Will the media now also show outrage over all these things up to this point in this campaign, 32 days out, that they've ignored about the other candidate?  It's all been out there!You may be seeing this for the first time.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON:  Do you remember the case where I represented that guy? It was -- it was a fascinating case.  It was a really interesting case. This guy was accused of raping a 12-year-old.  He took a lie detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed by faith in polygraphs. (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How did this turn out?  What...CLINTON:  Oh, plea bargained, got him off with time served in the county jail.  He'd been in the county jail about two months.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Wow!PIRRO:  The 12-year-old girl in this case, Hillary Clinton called her...HANNITY:  She has a name, by the way.  Kathy Shelton (ph) is her name.PIRRO:  All right.  Kathy Shelton now doesn't -- you know, realizes that -- that not only did Hillary ruin her life, but Hillary accused this 12-year- old girl of seeking out the company of men like the rapist.  She said she was emotionally unstable, and there was absolutely no evidence to support that.  She trashed the victim early in her career!  That is the course that she has taken throughout her life...HANNITY:  Clinton accused her...PIRRO:  ... so she could pursue her ambitions!HANNITY:  ... of seeking out older men.  But the comment about the lie detector test -- she knows he's guilty!PIRRO:  Right.CROWLEY:  But Mrs. Clinton enabled an accused rapist in this case and an alleged rapist in her husband, and we're talking about something Donald Trump said...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Locker room talk.CROWLEY:  You know what, Sean?  Russia today essentially threatened the United States with World War III with nuclear weapons, and we're talking about something Donald Trump was joking about 11 years ago!  This country has serious problems, and we need to be focused on that!HANNITY:  Listen, and so does the -- listen, the media needs to be indicted here because they're all into the tape!  They want to play it again and again and again!  Has anybody in the media played that Kathy Shelton tape but me?PIRRO:  I have, but I've heard anyone else do -- but here's the bottom line.  We now know what she said to Wall Street, that Wall Street, they're the best people to work (INAUDIBLE) Wall Street!HANNITY:  Listen, I need 12 hours to do tonight's show.PIRRO:  Open trade!HANNITY:  I can't get it all in.PIRRO:  Open borders!HANNITY:  I only have an hour!  And by the way, it irritates some people that I have one!(LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  All right, guys, good to see you.And coming up, we're going to continue to monitor Hurricane Matthew as it now batters the southeast coast.Plus, tonight, we're less than 48 hours away from the second presidential debate in St. Louis.  Today, Wikileaks, as Judge Jeanine said, released excerpts of Clinton's Wall Street speeches.  We're going to reveal what she was saying -- very interesting.  Jay Sekulow, Doug Schoen -- they'll way in with that and more straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to ""Hannity.""  So we're only two days away from the second presidential debate, and according to a brand-new Fox News poll just released tonight, the race is neck and neck.  In a four-way matchup, Hillary Clinton has a slim 2-point lead over Donald Trump, well, within the margin of error among likely voters.Joining us now, the author of ""Unholy Alliance,"" chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, Jay Sekulow, former Clinton pollster, Fox News contributor Doug Schoen.I know you have got a lot to say.  I'm getting to you.DOUG SCHOEN, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  Sure.HANNITY:  Jay, let me start with you.  I think we all agree what Trump says on this tape is wrong and inappropriate, as I said.  But does it now open a door and a narrative that probably wasn't going to come prior to these tapes being released, and that is the Kathy Shelton issue that I just played, the Juanita Broaddrick issue, the Kathleen Willey issue, the Paula Jones issue, Hillary's enabling and smearing and slandering of these women? And does it help Trump or hurt Trump?JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE:  I mean, my view is that this is -- Donald Trump has a very serious situation here, Sean.HANNITY:  Agreed.SEKULOW:  This was, as you said, indefensible.  It was a situation that was caught on tape.  It was 10 years ago, but it's -- look, the politics of reality are it's now front and center in this campaign.You had today a huge story -- it would have been a huge story on these e- mails and these speeches that have been released.  But this situation with the release of this audio and video I think is very damaging for that campaign.  Look...HANNITY:  I'm not going to disagree with you...SEKULOW:  ... Doug is much better at calling the polls on this...HANNITY:  ... but I'm asking a question.SEKULOW:  ... than I am, but I think it's very serious.HANNITY:  If Hillary says it's horrific and we can't allow this man in the White House, OK, that's her value and opinion.  But you've got to -- you know, you know, the media double standard, Jay.SEKULOW:  Yes.HANNITY:  Does it now raise -- in other words, is now -- a lot of things that have been off the table -- do they now come to the forefront?  In other words, is there going to be a national debate about her behavior, her husband's behavior, the treatment of women by both of them in many ways?SEKULOW:  Yes.  Well, look, it may become a national debate, Sean, but it's not a national debate that's going to help Donald Trump.  I mean, if anybody...HANNITY:  Why do you say that?SEKULOW:  ... thinks this is helping Donald Trump, I completely disagree. And I'm just being -- listen, I'm the grandfather...(CROSSTALK)SEKULOW:  ... of granddaughter, and it's unacceptable, what he said.HANNITY:  Do you think this kills Trump's campaign?SCHOEN:  No, I don't think it kills Trump's campaign, but I agree with Jay. It is an unnecessary distraction that...HANNITY:  Don't you think the Clinton campaign had this a long time?  Don't you think it was released on Wikileaks day?  Do you think this was an accident?SCHOEN:  Look, I don't think any...HANNITY:  I'm so cynical.  I've been around way too long.SCHOEN:  Sean, I don't think anything's an accident.  This is about winning and losing an election.  And when Donald Trump is on issues like change and corruption, he has a real chance to win.  When he's defending the indefensible, this tape, when elected officials are moving away from him, and with college-age women being his target audience and they would be most sensitive to this.  So I agree with Jay.  I think this is a big problem for Trump.HANNITY:  All right, so you were there in the Clinton White House...SCHOEN:  I was.HANNITY:  ... during the Lewinsky...SCHOEN:  Yes.HANNITY:  ... by the way, intern, cigar, oral sex, lies about it, impeached over it, and his ratings went up.SCHOEN:  Right.HANNITY:  SO what do you tell Donald Trump tonight?SCHOEN:  I tell Donald Trump to say, Look, I've made a mistake.  I've apologized.  Let's talk about the issues facing the American people, a stagnant economy...HANNITY:  You think that -- all right, so Sunday night, he goes into this debate.  And you know that Martha Raddatz and Anderson Cooper, this is issue one, two, three, four and five.SCHOEN:  Right.SEKULOW:  Yes.SCHOEN:  But here's the thing.  If he makes it clear he's sick and tired of distractions -- he's apologized.  He's made clear he's not politically correct.  And he wants to talk about the real problems and issues...HANNITY:  You think that works?SCHOEN:  It's a lot better than going to sex and getting into a smear-a- thon.  Absolutely.HANNITY:  You really...SCHOEN:  I absolutely believe that.HANNITY:  I actually -- listen...SCHOEN:  I would tell Trump that.HANNITY:  You know what?  I would actually give the same advice to him. Now, with that said, as a talk show host, to me, the phony moral outrage and selective moral outrage of Hillary is just -- the hypocrisy on display. That bothers me as a citizen...SCHOEN:  Right.HANNITY:  ... because there are a lot of millennials...(CROSSTALK)SEKULOW:  If you're Hillary Clinton's campaign manager right now, you know what you want to say?  You'd have her say nothing because this story is unfolding.  And that's (INAUDIBLE) the one tweet.  She's said nothing since then.  And I'm sure her campaign said, You say nothing, this thing is going to play out.  And it didn't play out well for Donald Trump.  You know, I'm just giving you the reality check as a lawyer.HANNITY:  So what would you tell him to do Sunday night?SEKULOW:  This is not helpful.HANNITY:  What would you tell him?SEKULOW:  Again, the e-mails would be the story but for this.HANNITY:  What would you tell him on Sunday night?SEKULOW:  Address the issues, don't get into a personal attack on Bill Clinton.  I don't think that helps him at all.  Deal with the fact that this is an administration of four more years and the kind of scandals we had, the fact that the Justice Department, the State Department, the White House were in cahoots with each other on all of these e-mail scandals...HANNITY:  Jay, I hear your indignation...(CROSSTALK)SEKULOW:  ... all the e-mail scandals in all those departments (ph) was the same lawyer.HANNITY:  I'm hearing your indignation...(CROSSTALK)SEKULOW:  ... same lawyer was at State, then the IRS!HANNITY:  My question is, I hear it, but there's a lot worse on the other side, and I don't hear the same indignation.SCHOEN:  But Sean...HANNITY:  Hang on.  Let me ask Jay...SCHOEN:  Please.HANNITY:  Why?  Why is there a double standard for you, then?  Jay?SEKULOW:  Well, look, I mean, it's not a question of a double standard, Sean.  It's a question -- I'm giving you the political reality of the evidence as it exists.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... why aren't you as outraged on these other issues that should have come up in this campaign but didn't come out because, I would argue, we have a biased media, but...SEKULOW:  Well, I agree with you that the media is biased.  I mean, I don't disagree with you at all...HANNITY:  But why are you more outraged...(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN:  Because Hillary Clinton wasn't the one...SEKULOW:  ... curveball.  You got one, you got to react to it.(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN:  ... allegations were about.  Look, Sean...HANNITY:  She was as guilty of smearing these women...SCHOEN:  Sean -- Sean, let me be clear.HANNITY:  Yes.SCHOEN:  The Russians are wreaking havoc in Syria!  They're destabilizing the Middle East, killing hundreds of thousands...HANNITY:  And you think a Trump pivot, apology -- I'm wrong, it as 11 years ago, it was stupid, pivot to the issues no matter what Hillary says...SCHOEN:  Absolutely!HANNITY:  ... wins the debate and wins the race?SEKULOW:  Yes.SCHOEN:  I don't know if he wins the race, but it sure is a lot better than getting into the mud.SEKULOW:  Absolutely.SCHOEN:  And you know what?  The problems in the country haven't changed in the last 48 hours.HANNITY:  Jay, you agree?SEKULOW:  I do.  I think if he -- if he -- if this becomes the cause on which he spends 10 minutes in the debate dealing with, he's going to lose this election.HANNITY:  All right.SEKULOW:  And if he doesn't get onto issues -- and look, he has to -- he should be out tonight, Sean, explaining this and apologizing for what he said.  That would handle it, not through a tweet, with a statement and get it over with.  If I was his lawyer, that's what I would tell him to do, get ahead of this.  He's not.  And every moment that's going by is worse, in my view.HANNITY:  All right, guys...SEKULOW:  And the media's not going to help him any.  We know that.  So the fact is, he better start addressing -- I agree with Doug.  He has to address the substantive issues here, or he's done.HANNITY:  All right, guys.  Good advice from both of you.  Appreciate it.Coming up...SCHOEN:  Thanks, Sean.HANNITY:  ... Wikileaks has released damning documents for the Clinton campaign.  Dinesh D'Souza, Dr. Gina Loudon -- they'll weigh in on that.Also, Hurricane Matthew continues to bear down on the southeast coast of the United States.  We're going to check in with our reporters on the ground and more on this busy Friday night.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to ""Hannity.""  Today, Wikileaks released over 2,000 e-mails allegedly from Clinton campaign staffers.  Now, the e-mails reportedly contain portions of Hillary Clinton's Wall Street speeches, in which she claimed to be, quote, ""far removed"" from we, the middle class. And they all contained information about opp research done on Clinton rival, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.Joining us now, best-selling author, creator of ""Hillary's America,"" which will be released on DVD October the 11th, Dinesh D'Souza, also radio talk show host and television talk show host Dr. Gina Loudon.  Good to see you both.GINA LOUDON, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Good to be with you, Sean.HANNITY:  Wikileaks, when I look at it -- let's see, she suggests Wall Street insiders are what is needed to fix Wall Street, she touts her relationship to Wall Street as a senator -- no wonder why she didn't want this released!Clinton talks about the challenges of running for office and how you basically have to lie and be a phony and you act one way in public and another way in private.Does this damage her, or was it overshadowed with this tape of Trump?DINESH D'SOUZA, ""HILLARY'S AMERICA"":  Well, I think the issue with Hillary-- in the first debate, Trump was right to emphasize the incompetence of Hillary, the failures of Hillary, but he didn't emphasize what he has himself been calling crooked Hillary.And the Wikileaks I think opens up a window into that because what Hillary does is that on the public campaign trail, she savages Wall Street.  She acts like she's their enemy.  But once she gets behind closed doors, not only does she receive large amounts of money from these guys, but she intimates to them, wink-wink, that she's actually their friend and she's happy to conspire with them against the American people when it's in her interest to do so, when she's paid enough.HANNITY:  Yes.  I just got a text from somebody -- I haven't been able to confirm this -- that apparently, that Dr. James Dobson said Trump is a new Christian and that what he said back in 2005 is probably not the same man today.  Do you think the American people would look at it that way, Dr. Loudon, or no way?LOUDON:  I do think the American people would look at it that way.  Sean, I was thinking tonight I wish we had one of your -- you know, town halls that you used to do, where you had all the people in a room because it would be interesting to ask a men full of -- a men -- a room full of men if they had never said anything remotely like that, aside from maybe pastors and priests, right, in their lives because I think that was locker room talk.Mr. Trump has apologized.  And when you hold that up and you look at what Hillary Clinton has done -- look, in Mr. Trump's case, in the entire record of his life, Sean, no one was raped, nobody has died, no...(CROSSTALK)LOUDON:  I mean, the list goes on.HANNITY:  This is important because we're talking about his words, and then we're talking about Bill Clinton's actions.  And Bill Clinton's actions and Hillary's defense of him...LOUDON:  Exactly!HANNITY:  ... not only defending him but also smearing women that made allegations -- you know, seems to be huge selective moral outrage here, and everyone is all offended.  The person that I laugh the most about is Hillary.  He can't be in the Oval Office.  She didn't say that about her husband and her husband's actions while he was in the White House.  She went to bat to call Monica a narcissistic loony toon.  So all of these people saying Hannity, you've got to condemn Trump.  All right, his words were wrong.  But Bill Clinton's actions are far worse.  So why is it covered this way, Dinesh?  D'SOUZA:  Well, I think that what we're seeing, we have seen a biased media in my entire adult lifetime but never before have I seen the media so aggressively huffing and puffing to drag this crooked hag across the finish line.  That is their objective.  And so to some degree, Sean, we're seeing journalists who wear the label of journalism.  But they're not really journalists.  They're actually doing a political mission for Hillary in this election.HANNITY:  Let me go back to a tape I played earlier about Kathy Shelton. And I'm not going to play it, but we played a cape of Hillary Clinton telling a story of how she defended a child rapist and how I even got him to take a lie detector test and forever told me those things don't work, and then laughed.  She ended up getting the child rapist off, and as a result Kathy Shelton has gone on to say horrible things about Hillary, that she was portrayed as a lifetime champion of women on the campaign trail, but just the opposite because of the way she attacked her as a 12-year-old girl.  Now my question, Dr. Loudon, if that was Trump, I bet everybody in America would have seen that tape.  I bet most people saw it right here for the first time tonight.  LOUDON:  This is a whole new level of global corruption we're seeing with the media and with politics both in the United States and abroad.  Let's not forget that even the cofounder of ""Politico,"" Sean, said that the media cards are stacked against Donald Trump.  This is a conspiracy like we have never seen before come to light, and we are witnessing it and we have a clear choice to make between someone who is part of that corruption and somebody who said some things once that I'm sure he regrets, and who hasn't.  HANNITY:  We're told that Donald Trump momentarily is going to be releasing in a two camera statement.  So when that happens we're going to bring it to our audience live.  I've got to fun.  Thank you both, Dr. Loudon, Dinesh, thank you.  And coming up, we have more hurricane Matthew news.  It is bringing a large storm surge and strong winds right up the southeast coast.  We'll also have our friends on the ground that are very bravely facing this storm, of course our reporters.  Plus, in less than 48 hours, Trump, Clinton face off in the second presidential debate, this one in St. Louis.  In light of today's breaking stories, what can we, the viewing public, expect?  And will another record breaking number of people be watching?  After today, maybe.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  This is a FOX News alert.  Any moment we expect Donald Trump is going to be releasing a video statement on the issue of the tape that was released by the Washington Post earlier today.  Also after hammering Florida, hurricane Matthew now is continuing to sit of the coast of Georgia at this moment, causing heavy flooding and high winds. Joining us now on the ground in Savannah, Georgia, is Rob Schmitt.  Rob, I'm very fond of Savannah, used to hang out by Tybee Island when I was in Atlanta.  How are things down there?  ROB SCHMITT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Sean, this is such a beautiful city with so much history that we hope is going to be protected tonight.  We're still waiting to get popped by Matthew.  It's been flirting with the U.S. coastline here for the last couple of days.  It still has not made it ashore.  That could happen here in Savannah, it could happen closer to Charleston, which is only about 100 miles straight up the road, South Carolina right across the Savannah River here.  We're going to have to wait to see where that line goes.  What's going to be very interesting about this storm is the fact that it's going to be high tide when it looks like it could move in here along this coastline.  Remember, that's exactly what happened with hurricane Sandy. That is what made that hurricane so devastating was all of that water. Water is really the problem when it comes to the hurricanes.  You saw it with Katrina, you saw with Sandy, water is really what makes things so dicey and dangerous.  Right now in Savannah it is a mandatory evacuation and a curfew is in effect.  You can't be out on the streets.  If you are, you need to get home or else you could get a big ticket.  We'll send it back to you.  HANNITY:  Thanks so much, Rob.  Stay safe, and all our best to our friends in Savannah.We are waiting Donald Trump's video statement.  Momentarily we're told it will come out.  Here with reaction to today's events FOX News contributor Mercedes Schlapp, former national justice director for Bernie Sanders Tezlyn Figaro is back with us.  Guys, good to see you both.  Mercedes, what's your reaction?  MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WASHINGTON TIMES:  Where do you want to start, Sean?  HANNITY:  Anywhere you want.  You can start anywhere you want.  (LAUGHTER)SCHLAPP:  I think, I have to say I think both campaigns are right now in crisis management mode.  I think for Donald Trump, you know, this tape, it's been devastating after having a rough week last week with the Alicia Machado tweets and the debate, and now with this.  And I think the one difference that you're seeing right now is that Donald Trump is taking action immediately.  He came out with a statement earlier apologizing.  I think he realized that the stakes are too high, that he needs to move and shift quickly to the issues.  And I think that's the right approach.  Will it be able to salvage the campaign?  You know, this is the wait and see.  We've seen the polls.  The polls are tight.  But I think that the steps that he's taking tonight are critical because he realizes that he's got to get back to the issues.  HANNITY:  Tezlyn, your thoughts?  TEZLYN FIGARO, FORMER NATIONAL JUSTICE DIRECTOR FOR BERNIE SANDERS:  I don't know if we're watching an episode of Porn Hub or politics.  (LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  Yes.  FIGARO:  All day long it's been the conversation about who is sleeping with who.  We want to be fair about it, let's talk about Bill Clinton and how women --HANNITY:  Hang on.  How dare you bring -- I've been watching Twitter all night.  How dare you Hannity talk about Bill Clinton and how he behaved in the Oval Office.  How dare you bring Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones up?  That's unfair, Hannity.  You can only talk about Donald Trump's words, not their actions.  And not what they said about these women.  FIGARO:  Well, you know, it's been going on since the beginning of time. Women were lined up with blue dresses since the kings.  HANNITY:  Whoa.  FIGARO:  In the Biblical days.  At the end of the day there are no victims. No one is confused.  If someone was waiting in line to kiss Donald Trump as a billionaire just as no one is confused when women have blue dresses in hand with Hillary Clinton.  My think is if Hillary Clinton pretends to be the black woman that she says she is, when is she going to put Bill Clinton out?  When is her moment, when is she going to burn the clothes on the White House lawn to really prove a point that she won't tolerate any of his foolishness from him and moving forward and so she continue on without Bill Clinton at her side. And that's why millennial women and young women between the age of 18 and 40 are not really buying into her message.  HANNITY:  I agree with all of that.  But I know the media as well as I do. Tonight we begin our 21st year here at the FOX News Channel.  I'm very appreciative to all of you for making this happen and allowing me to be here, although many people would love to see me go away one day.  Mercedes--SCHLAPP:  You're a keeper Sean.  You're definitely a keeper.  (LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  Thank you.  I understand people's outrage over the tape.  I heard it and said good grief, you know.  SCHLAPP:  Right.  HANNITY:  But why are people more outraged -- why does the media cover the words as strongly as they do, fair game to me, but yet all of this campaign most people do not know who this woman is, Kathy Shelton?  Hillary Clinton bragging on tape -- most people don't know that Hillary was part of a group that slammed and slandered these women that were accused.  So why is there that double standard?  SCHLAPP:  First of all, I think that the media and many liberals are thinking that this tape is really what's finally going to bury the Trump campaign.  They keep looking for the key moment, and yet he still manages to have nine lives and continue moving forward.  And I think for Hillary Clinton, you know, it really has been a long time since the 1990s.  And you know, they have to short term memory.  And there is that double standard of the fact that Hillary Clinton did make those comments, did call the women that were victims of her husband bimbos, and made several awful comments.   But it's --HANNITY:  Narcissistic loony toons.  She wanted to crucify Gennifer Flowers.  All true.  SCHLAPP:  But Hillary uses the sexist card constantly.  She used it on Bernie Sanders.  HANNITY:  Do you think this impacts the race?  That's the most important question.  We'll start with Tezlyn.  Do you think it impacts the race?FIGARO:  No.  Just like last week the people who support Trump will support him prior to the debate and after the debate.  HANNITY:  What about those people in the middle, the independents who haven't made up their minds yet?  Where do they go?FIGARO:  I really think independents have made up their mind.  I'm independent like myself and I think we've made up our mind before the race even really begun.  People have heard Hillary Clinton's story, they heard it when she ran the last time and lost and got beat.  HANNITY:  Real quick.  FIGARO:  Nothing has really changed.  HANNITY:  Mercedes?  SCHLAPP:  I think there's thos ewoman out there, and I just heard a couple of them saying can we get a do over and can we get two new candidates on the ballot?  HANNITY:  No do over. It's 32 days.  SCHLAPP:  That's right.  HANNITY:  I can't go back to March, 2015.  SCHLAPP:  I can't either.  I can't do it.  (LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  I need a break.  All right, guys, good to see you both.  And when we come back we're going to have more with Mercedes and Tezlyn after the break.  Plus, Donald Trump expected any moment to release a video statement.  When he does we will bring it to you right away right here tonight on ""Hannity.""  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to ""Hannity."" And we're being told that Donald Trump will be releasing a video statement momentarily.  When it happens we'll bring it to you right here on ""Hannity."" We continue with Mercedes Schlapp and Tezlen Figaro is back with us.  All right, so let's talk about Sunday.  He's going to release a statement, probably tonight, so I'm told. What does he do, Tezlyn, Sunday in the debate assuming that he releases a statement and addresses it before?  FIGARO:  Well, you know, I think that Trump probably won't focus on the statement but focus more on the missed opportunity that he had during the last debate, which was really show what he can do for the country, really focus on what Hillary Clinton has not done over the past 30 years.  He started out really strong in the last debate and I think he'll carry that through.  One thing we do know about Trump is that he is a businessman.  And I think he'll look at this as another business opportunity for him to be successful.  He doesn't like to lose.  So I don't think it will be more so about this Porn Hub discussion that we're talking about now but more so focused on the policies that are needed to move America forward.HANNITY:  Let me ask you, Mercedes, I know there is a lot of sanctimony especially among media people and they've never heard these horrible words before or locker room talk before.  I think they're all full of crap myself.  And I know everyone feigns outrage and they've never heard this before.  It's the worst thing they've ever heard.  And I go back to actions versus words, and is there going to be context given to Trump vis-a-vis the American people?  Are they going to see this as, you know what, we've all heard this before?  SCHLAPP:  It could play out in so many different ways, Sean.  I think that the Clinton campaign obviously they are going to take advantage of this and push it forward through more negative ads as they keep spending millions of dollars portraying Trump as being a sexist and a racist, et cetera, and all sort of isms.  And so I think the challenge will be with this direct response coming from Donald Trump and if he's able to stay on message during this town hall debate and say I'm not perfect.  I'm flawed.  But I'm here because I'm with the people.  And I'm here for those who don't have a voice and who have been left behind.  And I think if he speaks from the heart and he comes across as being authentic, I think it could help him.  I think he realizes at this point that this has been an awful mistake, and I think he wants to clear the air and move forward and move on and talk about what is important in America.  HANNITY:  And what would you tell him to do Sunday night?  SCHLAPP:  I think he's got to stick to the fact with this apology, which he's already said, and we'll see what he says in the video, and then say, look, we've got to focus on the policies.  We've got to focus on job creation, on national security, on safe communities.  Those are the messages that will resonate with the American voters, and pin it and talk about not only his strengths but about Hillary's deficiencies and the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton.  And I think, you know, we've seen now more and more that's coming out of the fact that obviously she struggles to connect with middle America and she says one thing publicly, and then she says something different privately to the Wall Street big money people.  And I think that's important to expose.HANNITY:  Tezlyn, again, let's go back to this, assuming he does this video, if not tonight I guess tomorrow morning.  We're told it's coming any minute, though.  Assuming this comes out.  Assuming it's sincere, assuming it resonates a little bit, then it's going to come up.  I imagined question one, two, three, and four.  What does he do?  Repeat the statement and move on?  FIGARO:  Guess what.  Nobody cares.  Where is Heidi Fleiss?  She has a long list of Democrats and Republican men who have been quite frequent --HANNITY:  If I get in trouble I want you defending me.  FIGARO:  Well, let's take a look at Marilyn Monroe with the beloved JFK. This has been going on since the beginning of time.  Nothing is new.  There is nothing new or different.  Women and men have laid at the feet of power people, including --   HANNITY:  I think Ken David had 500 concubines for crying out loud, isn't that what you said?FIGARO:  And I'm hoping Hillary Clinton has her a mistress on the side this time around.  HANNITY:  I don't know if the Clintons ever apologized to Paula Jones. They had to pay money.  I don't know if they apologized to lying about Gennifer Flowers.  He did admit in the Starr report.  I don't know if they apologized to Juanita, just the opposite, or Kathleen.  SCHLAPP:  But he got impeached.  He got disbarred.  He did have several consequences that the American people have forgotten.  HANNITY:  That is true.  SCHLAPP:  And millennials don't even know about.HANNITY:  All right, guys, thank you both.  And if that statement is released we'll show it to you momentarily as ""Hannity"" continues straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to ""Hannity."" This is going to be a fascinating 32 days.  A lot of people, rightly so, I would say, are outraged by the inappropriate comments that Donald Trump made, the words he spoke.  The question is, is this now going to be in play because there is a lot of actions by the Clintons that the media has ignored.  I challenge all in the media, are you now going to talk to the women that accused the Clintons of inappropriate behavior, of smears, of slanders?  Are you going to interview Kathy Shelton, Hillary Clinton represented the guy that she claims raped her.  And you hear Hillary on tape bragging and laughing about it.  In other words, does the next 32 days open up a whole new Pandora's Box? We'll see you Sunday night.  John Scott is next.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
