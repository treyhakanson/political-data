"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" November 17, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: At least two of my colleagues in the Senate aspiring to the presidency, Senator Cruz in particular, have voted to weaken the U.S. intelligence program just in the last month and a half. And the weakening of our intelligence gathering capabilities leaves America vulnerable.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Listen, I understand why Marco would want to tell voters now his position on immigration is the same as mine. I understand that he now regrets having been taken the position he did and having everyone see where he was. But I literally laughed out loud.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: Senator Ted Cruz started with immigration, took a couple kings swings at Senator Marco Rubio. Then Rubio firing back talking in the wake of Paris about the surveillance program and what's happening in the Senate. We're back with the panel. Robert, interesting that he chose two senators but didn't mention Rand Paul who, obviously, clearly has a dog in that hunt, but pointed out Senator Ted Cruz. What's going on between those two candidates now?ROBERT COSTA, THE WASHINGTON POST: These are two people who came in their 40s to the United States Senate, and they are watching outsiders Trump and Carson really dominate the race. But many insiders, people close to Rubio, close to Cruz, think eventually the field will narrow, the lanes will narrow, and you could have a Rubio-Cruz fight for the party.BAIER: But surprising to see Rubio take a swing like that?COSTA: Rubio has played on the ropes all year just waiting to throw a punch. Now it's getting closer to the Iowa caucuses. We're only months away. And you finally see Rubio starting to climb the ladder and throw some shots.BAIER: Ron?RON FOURNIER, THE NATIONAL JOURNAL: What Rubio has been great at is when he has been hit he has been able to turn that against the enemy, usually the press. With the ""New York Times"" at the story about his finances, he made that about indictment against the ""New York Times"" and played himself up as a blue collar guy. This is the first time he has thrown a direct punch like this.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, I think we are looking at the final four, Carson and Trump at the top right now, Cruz and Rubio -- as you say, these are go identically aged Cuban-American, first-term senators with silver tongues. One of them, I think, quite clearly is going to emerge as either the sort of acceptable second tier candidate who will go up against the winner of the bout of Trump. First there is Carson. And they are starting to fight now.BAIER: Trump is obviously getting a lot of attention for some of the things he said about ISIS. We played some of that earlier in the show. Ben Carson, a New York Times article coming out about his knowledge on foreign policy. ""Nobody,"" this is a quote, ""has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East. Duane Clarridge, a top advisor to Mr. Carson on terrorism and national security, said in an interview. He also said Mr. Carson needed weekly conference calls briefing him on foreign policy so, quote, ""We can make him smart."" The Carson campaign just responded, saying ""Mr. Clarridge has incomplete knowledge of the daily, not weekly briefings that Dr. Carson receives on foreign national security matters from former military and State Department officials. He is coming to the long career serving our military. Mr. Clarridge's input to Dr. Carson is appreciated, but he is clearly not one of Dr. Carson's top advisors. For the New York Times to take advantage an elderly gentleman and use him as their foil in their story is an affront to good journalistic practices."" Robert, I don't think we have heard the end of this.COSTA: No. And I have spoken to Barry Bennett, Carson's campaign manager. And he says Carson is trying to read up on foreign affairs. He just had lunch in New York City with Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state. But you see Carson's charm early on was that he was a political amateur. He's someone who has never been in office before. But in politics today in 2015, if you don't have a professional operation around you, people like this adviser go rogue and they cause problems.BAIER: Quickly, in the wake of Paris, does this make a difference?FOURNIER: It sure does. He is a decent man, a brilliant man. If you've watched him on the campaign trail, if you read the article, it's clear he not ready to be commander and chief.KRAUTHAMMER: It's not a matter of picking up a fact here and there. It's a matter of having thought about this for years and years as the experienced politicians have. He hasn't, and that's a liability that you cannot overcome in a short period of time.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: This is a ""Fox News"" alert. The Republican field is shrinking. Just hours after the New Hampshire primary, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina both suspending their campaigns, meaning they are dropping out. Now this after lackluster showings in New Hampshire.And last night's big winner, Donald Trump. And the big surprise, Ohio Governor John Kasich. He came out strong and finished in second place. And now the race heads south. Just before hopping on his plane and jetting off to South Carolina, New Hampshire winner Donald Trump went ON THE RECORD.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: Donald, nice to see you and thank you for joining us.DONALD TRUMP, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hello, Greta.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, Donald, last night, it was a whopping victory, 20 points in New Hampshire. It's more fun to win, isn't it?TRUMP: I love winning. It was a great win. It was a great victory. We love it.VAN SUSTEREN: Why do you think that on the Democratic side of the aisle that Hillary Clinton got -- she got clobbered by Bernie Sanders, 22 points over there.TRUMP: Yes it was surprising to see. And, you know, we are dealing with a socialist, perhaps even a communist. I listen to his speech last night. That was beyond socialism. So I don't know what's going on over there. That was a pretty big victory for him.VAN SUSTEREN: One of your hometown newspapers, ""The Daily News,"" Mort Zuckerman owns that and they had a pretty hostile cover front page to you. What's up with that?TRUMP: Well, I know him. He's an insecure guy. He's got a losing newspaper. He tried to sell it for the last two years. He can't get anybody to give him a dollar for it. It's a piece of garbage. And they put me on the cover every time they can. They always put me on the cover to try and sell the newspapers. It's going to fold up.I can't imagine anybody buying it. I mean, he's literally been begging people to buy it. But he's just an insecure guy. He's a loser.VAN SUSTEREN: Governor Chris Christie, you spoke last night. You had a long conversation. I assume that he congratulated you on your victory. What else did he tell you?TRUMP: Well, I just spoke to him a little while ago, again. And he spoke to me last night. And, you know, he's a friend of mine. He's a good guy? He is a tough cookie.VAN SUSTEREN: Also down in South Carolina, that's the next spot you are going. There is a former 2012 Romney campaign staff or consultant who has now got this Super PAC and it's taking a direct aim at you. Going up at the air. Your response to that Super PAC? They're aiming at you.TRUMP: Well, a lot of people have been aiming at me. You know, they are all aiming at me, I guess, and that's fine. And so far it's been only driving my numbers up. They should have devoted more time to Mitt Romney and helped him win instead of looking at, you know, taking other people down. But they have all been going after me. I've had, I guess, Bush spent 20 or $25 million on me. And he's like nowhere. He's going nowhere.And now Romney is doing a PAC, because Romney feels badly because frankly that was an election that he should have won. You know it and I know it. Four years ago, they should have won that election easily and they failed. So these people that -- these ex-Romney people should have focused more on getting Romney elected instead of doing Super PACs.VAN SUSTEREN: Is your strategy going to change much going into South Carolina? I mean, we're back to population or voting demographic, highly evangelical. Are you changing your strategy between New Hampshire and South Carolina?TRUMP: Not, too much. We really hit a chord. You know, we are talking about border security. We're talking about the military, the vets. And, you know, things that are pretty generic no matter where you are. I do great with the evangelicals. We have a great relationship. And I'm leading in evangelical vote in polling numbers, as you know, Greta. I'm leading over the nation. Throughout the nation I'm leading. And that's a great honor.And I don't think too much. Really strong military, great trade deals. You know, something I have been talking about right from the beginning. We want really great trade deals which we don't have now. We lose hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars on trade. I mean, just with China alone, we lose that. So, you know, I think the message is going to stay pretty much the same.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. The news today and some of the business news today is that Sears is going to accelerate the closing of 50 stores. And, you know, we always talk sort of big picture about politics. But closing 50 stores are really going to hurt a lot of families.If you are president today, is there anything you would say or do because these families, they are going to take the big hit.TRUMP: Well, the retailers have a lot of problems. Whether it's Sears or Macy's or any of them because it's sort of like becoming an older line business. But I don't know, Sears it looks like more of a financial play than anything else. You know, something is going to happen. They will either rent those stores or we rent the stores and they'll be knocked down and a building will be put there. It will all work out. Eventually, it will all work out.It doesn't look very good right now. I saw that. And Sears has a major headache as a company, you know that.VAN SUSTEREN: I went to Facebook and put your picture up and asked some questions. And Michael Patrick Martin, one of my Facebook people who likes me on Facebook says, what does it say about the polarization of the country that a socialist is winning the Democratic primary and how can you, that would be Donald Trump, compete in a general election with an opponent who claims virtually everything will be free.TRUMP: Well, because the taxes are not going to be free. Your taxes are going to be 95 percent. If you look at what this guy wants to do. I mean, frankly, they should be about 120 percent, if you really want to know the truth. Everything he wants to give away. You are talking about like 95 percent tax. Well, eventually, that will be explained. I'll explain it.VAN SUSTEREN: How do you run against it?(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: You run against it by explaining it. What I explained is just what I explained.VAN SUSTEREN: OK.TRUMP: Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. Another question -- another --TRUMP: Who's going to pay 95 percent tax? You literally would have to pay 95 percent tax to pay what this guy wants to do. I mean, he wants to take everything away from one group. But the truth is, once you get the taxes beyond a certain point, he is unelectable.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. Catherine Hagan, also on my Facebook page, says she's heard a lot about politicians talking about helping the vets and other people. But she says what about our seniors? And I see a lot of questions like, you know, if you are president, what are you going to do about social security and what about seniors?TRUMP: Well, you know, it's a great question, because I spent a lot of time with the vets and helping the vets. And people don't talk about the seniors. I'm talking about the seniors and I have been for a long while.The seniors are in a lot of trouble. And now they are talking about many people. They are talking about cutting social security. I am not going to cut social security. I'm bringing the jobs back. I'm lowering taxes. We're going to have a dynamic economy again, Greta. And we're not cutting social security.VAN SUSTEREN: We're just -- today, Carly Fiorina suspended her campaign. I don't know if you know that yet. But any thoughts about Carly's suspending hers?TRUMP: Well, I thought she was very nice. I thought she was very effective in a lot of different ways. I didn't know she suspended, but, you know, you have to do what you have to do. And we will see what happens with Chris, likewise.VAN SUSTEREN: One other question from Facebook. And I know you get this one a lot, but this is from Pat Myville (ph) and it says, why don't you act more presidential?I like you, but I don't like the bad words that you insert into your speech.Are we going to hear a little cleaner language or softer language or is this the Donald Trump?TRUMP: Well, sometimes, I will copy other people's language. But the other day, we had 5,000 people in New Hampshire. It was amazing. And in a blizzard, we have 5,000 thousand people. More than that. And a woman got up and used a little bit of a bad word and I said don't you dare use that word and everyone said what's the word? I said here's the word, but she used it and not me. We were just having fun.I reused her word. And I will tell you. The place stood up and they were giving a stand -- it was like a standing ovation. It's called politically correct. We're too politically correct. Now with that being said, as I get closer and closer to the goal, it's going to get different.You know, we started off Greta, you were there, right from the beginning, 17 people. Now we are down to not very many people, probably six in the end of the day, maybe even less than that. And once you get to a certain level, it changes. I will be changing very rapidly. I'm very capable of changing to anything I want to change to.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, billionaire -- another New York billionaire may get into the race, Mayor Bloomberg. At least we hear some sort of chatter.What have we -- what are your thoughts of another New York billionaire getting into the race if that happens?TRUMP: Well, I know Michael very well. He is a friend of mine. I hope he gets into the race. I think it would be good. I would love to compete against him. And I think we do very well. I would love to see Michael in the race.VAN SUSTEREN: What have -- in looking at this, you have now become a politician because you are in politics. What's the biggest thing that has surprised you from the inside or from being a politician that you never anticipated when you were just a billionaire businessman?TRUMP: I will tell you what really -- a little bit surprised me, but it's a pleasant surprise how smart the American public is. How much the American public cares and how they want to change the country and bring it back.And I have never seen anything like it. It's a slugfest. I mean, like tonight, I'm leaving as soon as we are finished here. I'm going to South Carolina. We have thousands and thousands of people showing up for an event, like a rally or whatever you want to call it that I set up like two days ago. It's unbelievable.So the love they have for this country, Greta, is unbelievable. And that's a very pleasant surprise. I assumed it, but not to the extent that I've seen. It's incredible.VAN SUSTEREN: Donald Trump, thank you very much for joining us. I hope you will come back soon.TRUMP: I will, thank you."

"This is a rush transcript from ""Journal Editorial Report,"" August 22, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, HOST: This week on the ""Journal Editorial Report,"" the Clinton campaign fights back as the e-mail controversy continues to take its toll on the Democratic frontrunner. Will voters buy her defense?  Plus, Donald Trump forces the GOP candidates to weigh in on some controversial immigration issues. We'll tell you where they stand.And Democrats roll out their plans to curb college costs. But could their proposal raise the price of a degree? Find out after these headlines.(FOX NEWS REPORT)GIGOT: Welcome to the ""Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.Hillary Clinton's camp is stepping up its response to allegations that she stored sensitive material on her private e-mail server after a court filing this week revealed that intelligence agencies have flagged more than 300 documents from Clinton's account that may contain classified information.  The problem, her campaign argued this week, isn't Clinton's handling of the emails, but the dysfunctional system used by the government to designate what's secret.During a testy exchange with reporters in Las Vegas Tuesday, the former secretary of state claims she's the innocent victim of that agency battle.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE & FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE:  It has nothing to do with me, and it has nothing to do with the fact that my account was personal. It's the process by which the government and sometimes, in disagreement between various agencies of the government, make decisions about what can and cannot be disclosed.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman; editorial board member Joe Rago; and Washington columnist, Kim Strassel.So, Kim, in the ongoing e-mail saga, what is the most important detail we learned this week?KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: I think the most important thing -- well, a couple of things. One, we have found out that the server that was turned over to the FBI was, in fact, according to Mrs. Clinton's lawyers, wiped clean. We still don't know what that means yet in terms of their ability to retrieve data, but that was one thing. We've also seen the Clinton camp become very defensive about this, which suggests that they and the Democratic Party realize that there's a bit of a problem for them.GIGOT: Right.STRASSEL: Because of revelations about classified material, which has also been in the news yet more again this week.GIGOT: But, Kim, also we've learned that there really was a lot of classified information that's crossed her e-mail back and forth. Maybe more than 300. That's just based on the documents that have been looked at so far. This is an escalating problem of mishandling classified information.STRASSEL: Yes, and we also have new reports -- there was a story out from Reuters this week that suggested that some of this information that just by its very nature, whether or not it was marked classified or not in her account, by its very nature should have always been viewed as classified because, for instance, it included high-level discussions between the secretary of state and foreign diplomats.GIGOT: So, James, her response, ""I didn't know it was classified when it came in to me, and I never sent knowingly classified information.""  Adequate?JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: No, it's not adequate.  You remember the Clinton campaign also said -- a few weeks ago, made a stink with the press saying, ""She's being investigated, it's not criminal yet,"" but it should be a criminal investigation because, for anyone not named Clinton, it would be. As Judge Mukasey, the former attorney general, wrote in our paper last week, it's punishable for up to a year in jail for having classified information in an unauthorized location, her server. It does not matter whether she allowed someone to mark ""classified"" on it.GIGOT: This would be misdemeanor?FREEMAN: Yes.GIGOT: OK.So, Joe, what about Judge Emmet Sullivan this week, in a court hearing said -- told the FBI and the State Department, get on the stick to get the information and response to a Freedom of Information Act request from Judicial Watch, information from her server as well as from the thumb drives that Hillary Clinton's lawyer turned out to the FBI. Reluctantly, but they have turned it over. How significant is the judge's order?JOE RAGO, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: I think it's pretty significant. You've kind of got these circling cases, there's three Freedom of Information cases in court, and sort of a growing outside suspicion from the intelligence community, from the FBI. They're really the only people that can force some kind of resolution to this. If it's left to the political system, you're going to continue to see these kinds of made-up excuses.  Look, she was the secretary of state, she decides what is classified.  That's one of her jobs. Just the fact that anything -- any of her official business was on a private server is troubling.GIGOT: James, how much damage is it doing to her standing politically?FREEMAN: Certainly, she's been gradually, not quickly, but gradually sinking in the polls since these revelations came out in the sprint.  Trustworthiness going down as well. Approval rating not looking good. But she's still kind of hanging in there. She's still the leading Democratic candidate, I guess you would say. But I think this legal problem and maybe more on the investigative side, the potentially criminal side than the lawsuit side, is going to be a problem because, unless she's saying she hired somebody to sit in the bathroom in Denver and review these things, the fact that they're unmarked is going to be a consequence of her running this private operation.Kim, you know, a wise man, once told me a slogan, ""If there's no alternative, there's no problem,"" and I think that the Clinton strategy on this is that. If there's no alternative to Hillary Clinton for the nominee, they figure the Democrats are going to circle the wagons, they'll get behind her, and all of this will fade as the campaign goes along. Is that why she's trying to use the partisanship defense here and saying it's all just the Republicans?STRASSEL: Absolutely. It's what Clintons do. The goal here, as you said, is to keep everyone focused on the prize, which, in the Clintons' minds, is the Clintons. I think the problem for the Clintons is Democrats are looking around, wondering if they don't need another person to come in.  The polls, in fact, just this week, there was a couple of really devastating ones for her showing her losing in head-to-head matchups against most of the top Republican tier candidates in places like Florida and Pennsylvania, which really matter. You've also begun to have some Democrats publicly starting to question her. A Democratic member of Congress, John Yarmuth, actually came out and said that he was very concerned that he could never get the facts from the Clinton campaign, worried that this might up-end her run.GIGOT: Well, Yarmuth's career is going to be over before too long, I'll tell you that.(LAUGHTER)All right.Still ahead, Donald Trump's call to end birth-right citizenship divides the Republican presidential field. A look at where the candidates stand on that and other immigration issues, and the potential fall-out in 2016, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE & CEO, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: A woman is going to have a baby, they wait on the border. Just before the baby, they come over to the border. They have the baby in the United States. We now take care of that baby -- Social Security, Medicare, education. Give me a break. It doesn't work that way. The parents have to come in legally.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Donald Trump taking on the issue of birth-right citizenship. The Republican frontrunner pushed immigration proposals this is week that include ending automatic citizenship for children born to parents here illegally, as well as deporting the 11 million undocumented immigrants already here.So, Joe, birth-right citizenship, you have looked at that issue and the legal history of it. Donald Trump says it's unconstitutional. What do you think?RAGO: I think he is promoting a crank theory of the Constitution that has absolutely no basis.GIGOT: This is in the 14th Amendment.RAGO: This is the 14th Amendment. It says anyone born --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: The Civil-War era.RAGO: The Civil-War era. Necessary to include black former slaves as part of American politics. It said anyone born on U.S. soil, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, shall be a U.S. citizen. It doesn't matter about their genetic heritage. It doesn't matter about their circumstances of their birth. It says anyone born in U.S. soil is --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: There was a Supreme Court decision in the late 19th century --RAGO: Right, 1898.GIGOT: -- involving a Chinese immigrant.RAGO: San Francisco-born Chinese dissent, raised exactly this issue. It's well settled as a matter of Supreme Court precedent. It's well settled as a matter of just the plain reading of the text. And there's sort of -- the restrictionists are coming out and saying, well, ""subject to the jurisdiction"" means that if an illegal alien is here in America and they have a kid, they're not subject to the jurisdiction. This is crazy.  They're essentially saying if an immigrant commits a crime, they cannot be prosecuted for it.GIGOT: James, so, but nonetheless, all the Republicans are getting behind Trump on this in some form or fashion. Smart politics?FREEMAN: I hope not. I think it's refreshing to see Chris Christie say that really the problem here is lawlessness, not immigration. Let's address lawlessness. Let's enforce our immigration laws. But let's realize Trump is doing horrible cost-benefit analysis. All he is looking at are costs. He talks about public schools. He is not looking at the resource that more people bring us when they work, when they produce, when they create. You can go to Silicon Valley and look at all the immigrants doing great things in technology. But even in terms of Mexican immigration -- I know people are focused on that -- South American immigration, there are jobs here in the United States. There are western growers who will pay $17 an hour. They can't find anyone to do the work. People want to come here, they want to work. That's what we need.GIGOT: But birth-right citizenship is something that is really just a symbolic issue. It doesn't really involve all that many immigrants, really. And besides, you need to have a constitutional amendment to overturn it, that's not going to happen. And --(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: It's not going to happen. It's also the wrong approach. We have a president who will not enforce the law. The solution is not to write more laws. It's to elect a president who will enforce the law. And you may see this issue kind of cool down once that happens.GIGOT: What about the deportation issue, Kim? That hasn't had as many of the Republican -- other Republican candidates get behind it. But this idea that everyone who is in the United States illegal would have to be deported. Now Trump has said -- he's backtracked a little bit since his first announcement on it, saying, well, they would have to go back, touch down, and then the good ones, as he put it, would be able to go back. I'm not so sure how he would sort the good from the bad there.(LAUGHTER)But the point being that -- he is still saying we have to put them basically on buses and send them back over the border. Is that realistic politically either?STRASSEL: No. But I think we're beginning to get to see what the real affect of Donald Trump in this race is going to be. It still seems unlikely he might win the nomination. But the question is, how many positions is he going to push Republicans into, unfeasible positions, by the time he exits this race. And the deportation thing is an excellent example of that. The idea of them all going on record -- and they haven't all, they have been a little more nuanced than they have on birth-right citizenship -- and rounding up 11 million people and somehow shipping them out, the cost of that would be enormous, the logistics would be practically impossible. It sounds good. It's symbolic, the way that you mentioned that birth-right citizenship is. But it's not necessarily a practical policy, nor is it a way forward on immigration reform.GIGOT: Do you think -- how big of a problem is it, Kim, briefly, for the Republicans following Trump down, or is this something that they'll be able to get away from if some of them endorse it during the campaign?STRASSEL: I don't think it's ever good when Republicans are going to go on record as rounding up babies to put them on buses and send them back over the border.GIGOT: All right.Still ahead, as students across the country head back to campus, a look at the skyrocketing cost of college tuition. It's a hot topic on the campaign trail as the Democratic candidate makes a play for Millennial voters. But will their plans really make that degree more affordable?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Well, as students across the country prepare to head back to school, skyrocketing college costs are becoming a hot topic on the campaign trail. A new report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York says average tuition climbed a whopping 46 percent from 2001 to 2012, while student loan debt exceeds $1.2 trillion in the U.S. But never fear. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders are both selling plans to make college more affordable, and maybe even free.""Wall Street Journal"" assistant editorial features editor, Kate Bachelder, joins with us more.So, Kate, what is Secretary Clinton proposing?KATE BACHELDER, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL FEATURES EDITOR: Well, Hillary is proposing a $350 billion plan.GIGOT: That's billion.BACHELDER: Yeah.GIGOT: Over 10 years.BACHELDER: Over 10 years, that would offer federal subsidies to states who guarantee free community college and debt-free four-year public education.  So she also would like to cut student loan interest rates, below Elizabeth Warrens', and she also wants to open up allowing borrowers to repay based on what they earn. It's already an option now but she would like to make it available to everyone.GIGOT: So reduce the cost of loans and then make it easier to write off those loans and not repay them?BACHELDER: Exactly.GIGOT: OK, now what about Bernie Sanders? Is he doubling down on that?BACHELDER: Well, Bernie Sanders wants to eliminate tuition. So it's a competition of who can make college the most free throw, and he wants to --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: Free in a sense that the students but not for the country.(CROSSTALK)BACHELDER: That's right.GIGOT: The taxpayers are paying, yeah.BACHELDER: But Bernie's plan is to basically make it so public schools, nobody has to pay tuition to get there. He's pitching public education as a public good that should be free for everyone in the sort of ideological case where Hillary is not really making that argument.GIGOT: Is there -- what's the evidence on whether or not these kinds of subsidy programs actually reduce the cost of college?BACHELDER: This is irony. She thinks that college is expensive because we haven't spent enough money. In reality, college is so expensive because we spent so much money. A new Federal Reserve study that we've written about says that for every dollar in aid, in loans, subsidized loans, and in Pell Grants, colleges raise tuition anywhere from 55 cents to 70 cents. So instead of this money going to students and helping them defray the costs of college, it's going to colleges as they raise tuition.GIGOT: So great for professors --BACHELDER: Right.GIGOT: -- great for administrators, but it doesn't overall reduce the cost of college education?BACHELDER: Right.GIGOT: OK.But, James, the politics of this, they clearly think it's a really good idea. They think it's going to sell. And it has, in the last couple of elections, worked for Barack Obama with the youth vote. What do you think about the politics of this going forward?FREEMAN: Yeah, I think maybe some of the youth vote starts to look at the trouble they get into as they try and pay back. So I guess the play here is let's make it all free. Let's hit taxpayers even more.GIGOT: Because that's who would ultimately pay.FREEMAN: Yeah.BACHELDER: Of course. But I think parents are also worried. I think this is a huge source for anxiety. And Republicans should be happy to talk about it. Student debt has nearly doubled under President Obama and it's not just the recession that's caused that.GIGOT: Who is talking about it on the campaign trail?BACHELDER: Marco Rubio has gone to talking about it and Scott Walker a great line that Hillary charges $220,000 just to show up at colleges -(LAUGHTER)-- while he's freezing tuition.GIGOT: So what is the alternative, the Republican alternative? Marco Rubio has an interesting plan, intriguing plan about college accreditation, which would ease the rules to make it easier for -- to get more competition in college, for example.BACHELDER: Right.GIGOT: One of the things the Hillary Clinton plan doesn't do, is it doesn't go to for-profits, which is a great source of education, particularly for people who have to work at night, young parents, parents of young children who can't afford full-time college. Are they proposing anything else, the Republicans?BACHELDER: Well, Marco Rubio has approved accreditation reform that would basically be good for people who don't need traditional education --GIGOT: Right.BACHELDER: -- and shouldn't be going to four-year colleges, and would do much better in a vocational program. So he would allow more programs like that to exist. That doesn't really address that most students want to go to a good four-year college, that this idea is that's where you want to get your education. So there aren't a lot of real Republican alternatives to that yet. And I think they should come up with them.GIGOT: They have to engage on this if they want to win, James, otherwise they're in trouble.FREEMAN: Yeah, but --(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: -- I think there is a natural advantage here. Big picture, I don't think what every kid dreams about is getting highly indebted and then running away from the debt because they can't find a job later to finance it. So I think, to the extent they talk about, how do we actually get some payoff for that education, how do we get the economy moving. That may be a stronger argument.GIGOT: All right. Thank you all very much.We have to take one more break. When we come back, ""Hits & Misses"" of the week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Time now for our ""Hits & Misses"" of the week.Kim, start us off.STRASSEL: Paul, you might have thought the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran couldn't get any worse, but, in fact, we found out about the existence of a secret side deal that our negotiators supposedly had nothing to do with and that Congress has not seen the contents of that, in essence, gives Iran the lead role in conducting its own inspections and then going back and alerting the international community that everything is A-OK. The whole point of this deal was, in fact, to make Iran stop producing nuclear weapons and also give the international community the tools it needed to guarantee that that's what was happening. None of that is happening. It's another reason for Congress should vote this down.GIGOT: All right, thanks, Kim.Joe?RAGO: Paul, not a great week for politics, as we've been discussing, but let me extend a hit to something a little bit more sustentative, which is Scott Walker's plan this week to replace Obamacare. He'd extend tax credits to individuals buying private health insurance on the individual market. It includes -- and befitting the governor, it includes a lot of innovative Medicaid reforms. This is intellectual progress for the GOP.  Hopefully it starts a robust debate as the candidates follow his lead.GIGOT: Replacing ObamaCare not just repealing it.James?FREEMAN: This is a hit, Paul, to two Army veterans who have been trying to make NFL football teams this summer. Nate Boyer, trying to become a 34- year-old rookie with the Seahawks.GIGOT: Wow.FREEMAN: -- with the Steelers. Now, this week, unfortunately, the Seahawks released Boyer. But I think other clubs should be looking at this guy. These are leaders and studs, and they ought to make rosters this summer. Let's hope they do.GIGOT: They're certainly tough enough for the job, that's for sure.FREEMAN: Absolutely.GIGOT: All right.That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. We hope to see you right here next week.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)ASHTON CARTER, DEFENSE SECRETARY: The Iraq forces just showed no will to fight. We can give them training. We can give them equipment. We obviously can't give them the will to fight.JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS: Does the White House agree with that assessment?JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, that certainly has been a problem that we've seen in the past. That's what allowed ISIL to make such significant gains last summer. So what the United States and our coalition has been focused on is making sure that we can enhance the capacity of the Iraqi Security Forces in supporting the Iraqi central government as they try to unite that country.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, an attempt by White House press secretary Josh Earnest to talk about the defense secretary, Ash Carter, characterizing the Iraqi troops and the fall of Ramadi. Vice President Biden went further, calling the Iraq prime minister to say that Iraqi troops are working hard and that they're committed to the goal, but it was a bit of a cleanup effort after what was said about the Iraqi military, although many analysts say very true. It does look like they melted away in both Mosul and Ramadi. So where are we now in this fight, both the politics and the policy. We're back with our panel. Steve?STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, look, this problem has a long history here. You have to go back and remember that when the Obama administration in effect said we are out of Iraq, we are done with Iraq. We are not going to it continue to press Maliki, Prime Minister Maliki, in effect what Maliki did was clear out the Sunni leaders of the military, took various units with Sunni leadership and replaced them with Shia, Shia who were close to the political parties that are loyal to Iran.So you, in effect, had Shiites fighting for the provincial capital Anbar province, a Sunni stronghold. It's no wonder that they didn't fight. But this is not something that happened yesterday. This is something that's happened over the years. The real question is will these new Shiite militias, the PMUs, be able to actually overtake Ramadi. I think military analysts are split on that. Some of them say that they will because they are better fighters. You can just increase the numbers. But others say that they won't and point to the difficulties that the United States had back when we were fighting in Ramadi with 20,000 troops on the ground. We didn't have success until we had 20,000 Sunnis fighting alongside us as part of the Anbar awakening, something that will not happen here. We are not going to see that here. So it's a pretty dire set of circumstances.BAIER: Yes, to your point, General Stan McChrystal on Fox today talking about Secretary Carter's comments about the Iraqis.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEN. STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL (RET), FORMER ISAF COMMANDER: It's pretty understandable that Iraqi forces out in Ramadi got shaken. But I don't think that's what Secretary Carter was talking about. I think Secretary Carter was talking about the will of the government of Iraq to be strong enough to show the kinds of leadership and the kinds of internal cohesion that's necessary here.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Kirsten, we have heard the president. We have heard the secretary of state say that the Iraqis have to step up. But seeing what we are seeing, is there the sense of frustration that the U.S. has to do more, and the White House is closing the door on doing more?KIRSTEN POWERS, USA TODAY: Yes. I think anybody watching this has to feel frustrated because it seems the answer is, if anything is going to change, Americans have to be more involved in it, and most Americans don't want that. And so we're in this catch-22 position where we look at it and say should there be even the people that are already over there, should they be, the president said they can't be in any combat role. Should they be --BAIER: Unleashed.POWERS: Yes, stepping into some sort of combat role. It just seems painfully obvious that nothing is going to change without that. But at the same time because we are so beleaguered about war and American people don't really want Americans being involved in another ground game in Iraq, I feel that the president's' happened are tied to a certain extent.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: The reason why Ramadi fell and why Anbar has fallen is because the Sunnis have correctly interpreted the actions of a government, first Maliki and now the new prime minister, as being highly sectarian. And in having to choose between ISIS and an Iraqi government that persecutes and goes after Sunnis, it's been a tough choice. Some have gone one way, some the other.To me the big mistake in our policy is trusting the Iraqi government and what's known as the Iraqi army, as Steve indicates, hallowed out and corrupted when all the Shiites were expelled -- all the Sunnis, sorry, were expelled and replaced by cronies of the government and henchmen of Iran. That army is not going to fight. What Carter said is exactly right. It had no will and ran away. The question is, why are we still supplying the friends that we have in Anbar, the Sunnis, through Baghdad, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Iran, central government will not arm them, and that's the problem. If we had people there who are sympathetic to our cause who got a directed shipment of arms, and as I said the other night, and like the Kurds also in the north, we would have a chance. Otherwise, we will have what we have now, a self-declared sectarian war. When the government announced the name of the operation for recapturing Ramadi, mentioning the name of the Shiite martyr that started the sectarian split 1,400 years ago, that was announcement this is a religious war, Iranian surrogates, Shiites against Sunnis. That's a war where we can't win no matter who wins.BAIER: And just on the point about providing weapons, weapons to the Kurds, who are the big fighters in the north, are still to this day going through Baghdad, a Baghdad that moved equipment to Ramadi and then ran away from it so now it's in the hands of ISIS.HAYES: It makes absolutely no sense. The Kurds understand the predicament. That's why they are begging us for these weapons. It makes sense to supply them directly to the Kurds, and I would argue directly to the few remaining Sunni tribesmen that we have alliances with going back to the Anbar awakening in 2006 and 2007.KRAUTHAMMER: It's the Kurds. It's the few Sunnis who support us. It's the Ukrainians. It isn't a matter of American boots on the ground. Why aren't we supplying these people with the weapons they need and they are begging us for? The administration has never answered that.BAIER: That is it for the panel. But stay tuned to see who may be tired of politics.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.Disappointing Jobs Report Fueling New Debate Over Need for Tax CutsGary B. Smith: Research comes out every day, the most latest from the National Bureau of economic research said that there is a positive correlation between tax cuts and job growth. But, even if we look back at real life examples, every major economic expansion we've had for the last 50 years, has been spurred by tax cuts. Kennedy in the '60s, Reagan in the '80s, Clinton in the '90s, that economy took off when he lowered the capital gains tax, each of those saw robust growth in jobs. I think the evidence is very clear, I don't know why you wouldn't cut taxes.Emily Tisch Sussman: First of all, I think we should put the jobs numbers that came out today in perspective. Yes, they may be lower than many had hoped, but we are still in our 69th straight month of private sector job growth. So, I think there should be a little bit of perspective on that. But as to the GOP plans moving forward, they are definitely catching on to something of this populist messaging, the populist sense in America today. So they're throwing a little bit of a bone towards, almost symbolic really, in tax cuts towards the middle class. But when we look at their job proposals as their tax proposals as a whole, what their primarily doing is to continue to benefit those at the top hoping it does trickle down, I just don't know if regular Americans are going to buy it. They want to see solid programs that help them.John Layfield: There is a trickle down and I agree with Gary B. in principal. Look, the bigger numbers here are six and a half years of a deficit that has almost doubled. Now we've tried it both ways, guys. So we cut taxes under President Bush, the deficit almost doubled. We raised taxes under President Obama, the deficit is almost going to double. President Obama's budget increases the deficit eight trillion dollars over the next 10 years. All of these republicans, none of them are balancing the budget. They're all roughly the same. No one has any fiscal responsibility. It's not about cutting taxes, it's not about raising taxes, we've go to balance the budget, we need major reform to major issues and the fact that we haven't had a president who can get along with congress over the last 20 years, is the biggest problem in our country.Susie Welch: There are a lot of different problems and tax cuts are one way, and in the past couple of years there's just been a apology gigantic and there's 21federal agencies and 15 federal departments that watch the free market. Some of that has to come apart and come down so that we can get them going again and have the job growth. We're looking at a long term picture and 50 percent of the people under employed or employed.Jonas Max Ferris: There are no plans to cover the cost of the radical tax cuts. They want to sound great. The best that we can get from the point is that no one can get anything and that could have the benefits of the job market. That's feasible. Whatever it is, that's going to make it a goal that we're going work for. Across the board to every bracket is not going happen. We're learning the deficit.Hurricane Joaquin May Not Be a Direct Hit, But That Doesn't Mean It's Not Going to Create a Big MessSusie Welch: This reminds me of a well to do relative that lives out t at that cannot see like a rich aunt that pays for you to go to college, but she cannot see what you're doing evidence. You could be partying or studying. That's the analogy of the federal government for paying. Who is happy that they exist? I have no idea how the money is spent, and neither do you. Nobody knows, but the money is out the door and there's no accountability to prevent it later. People want FEMA to go away completely. We need a federal emergency disaster, but one that has over site.Jonas Max Ferris: Well, let me tell you because I cannot make it to the studio because of the floods on the street. The city has taken money and puts hundreds of thousands of dollars into pumps and raises roads so that you can live there when the water comes up from the moon or floods or hurricanes. That makes people want to live there. There's a way to do this and that's the best example in the country. I will say that sandy has improved things. It's better than it was before. The government does not subsidize. If sandy happened, it would be as costly than the last time.John Layfield: I do agree with the private insurance and building them and rates and you see that in the areas with the hurricanes. It makes a big difference. There are certain thing that is the government needs to step in on. Look at sandy. There were the Alaska fish. You wonder where the money goes, Susie is right that no one knows. We're a reactive government. Not a proactive government. We can save so much more money through prevention. It's like the drought when it rains, it's over with. Nothing is done to fix it. We have to be proactive in the United States.Gary B. Smith: No, I don't. Susie mentioned that she thought that FEMA should exist, and I am one of the people that thinks that it should not. It's a waste. 29 States fund it for the other 21. If you choose and I live on a canal here, I pay through the nose for flood insurance and extra flood insurance. I am not putting that on the government. Like Jonas living in Miami you're in an area that's prone to hurricanes, floods and tornados. That's your choice. The state is responsible and the individual. Not the federal government. The federal government cannot manage anything. To have the blanket out there the governors when too FEMA was enacted learned to gain the system immediately. That's why the money is so wasteful.Emily Tisch Sussman: Look all of the things that we're calling for and more prevention in place and moreover site, these are the things that you just do not get when you continuously cut and cut way at the government. It's great to have more, but don't you have to fund that? Prevention is great. Those are things that you have to put in place. The biggest problem when you get into flood and tornado and hurricanes ask that many in the party are so reactive to the idea of weather and the climate change, that they write it in to bills.First Our Treasury Secretary Says We'll Run Out of Money in One Month, Then President Obama Says Raise Our Debt Limit or We'll Pay a Big PriceJohn Layfield: No, that's a revision to say that. He was the one that said that raising the debt ceiling was a failure of leadership and that America deserves better. I agreed with him then and I do now. It's a failure of leadership as it was then, and America deserves better. We have to raise the debt ceiling. It's silly not to do that. You have to tie it in a balance budget that's going to happen five or ten years from now. Until you do that, all you're going to do is ray it every few years and it's a failure of leadership. America deserves better.Emily Tisch Sussman: We have to be serious about this. We cannot put America at risk every time. This is something that they have to take seriously. These debt are in cured. We don't want to mess with something like this.Gary B. Smith: When I hear people say that we're putting the full faith in whatever of the United States, I want to tear my hair out. First of all we would have enough money if we pass the debt limit to pass it, social security, Medicare and Medicaid. Second of all in 85 we went three and a half months after the debt ceiling was hit before we raised it 95 four and a half months. This has been done before. This is the only way to write the ship. The president would have to prioritize the bills that he is going pay. That's his responsibility.Susie Welch: We can talk about this from an economic standpoint, but this is the politics. This is them trying to get them to shut down the government. It's about optics and how they look at the shut down and there they are shutting down the government again. This is just a political power play, and we can talk about it and deal with it when there publicans have it gain and then deal it with it in a way. Until then, it's just politics.Jonas Max Ferris: It's because of too much debt. Let's not forget that. I would say that they should not have any debt ceiling. It's one thing to make it go up. They're fighting over something that's not making an impact on it anyway. That's ridiculous.PredictionsGary B.
