Well how about this: A Democrat running for the state legislature in North Carolina not only refused to attack his opponent, he actually endorsed him and campaigned for him. And it, well, worked.Stan Morse beat Sam Brewer, the man he endorsed and campaigned for 54 to 46 percent to be the nominee from their district in Raleigh. Morse won despite submitting a concession speech the day before the election and spending Tuesday outside a Raleigh polling place asking people to vote for Brewer.The problem is that Morse actually meant it. He wanted to lose. He tells FOX News he only entered the race when it appeared the Republican incumbent would go unchallenged, not knowing Brewer had earlier thrown his hat in the ring. Now Morse says he doesn't know what he'll do.The Doctor Is InA group of students and faculty at Washington University in Saint Louis is planning to protest the awarding of an honorary doctorate to longtime conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly. The dissenters are upset with Schlafly's record of criticizing feminism -- particularly her opposition to the equal rights amendment in the 1970's.There has been no word of protest about any of the other five people being awarded honorary degrees, a list that includes liberal cable news broadcaster Chris Matthews and outspoken liberal musician Quincy Jones.The school is defending its decision to honor Schlafly, saying she has been a catalyst for vigorous debate on difficult issues.Blame GameThe president of the African nation of Senegal says the United Nations' food agency is a waste of money that should be eliminated. And Abdoulaye Wade also says the U.N.'s food and agriculture organization is itself largely to blame for the rising cost of food because of its inefficiency.Wade calls the agency a ""bottomless pit of money largely spent on its own functioning with very little effective operations on the ground.""He terms the traditional international food aide system a ""huge swindle"" and says the money often ends up being used for trips and luxury hotels instead of concrete actions on the ground.U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says he understands Wade's frustration, but says the food and agriculture organization is a key player in the push to improve agricultural productivity.Storm of the CenturyNovelist Stephen King is firing back against critics upset with a statement he made about education and the military.King said in April at the Library of Congress, ""If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that. It's not as bright.""One blogger likened King's remarks to those of former Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry about how young people without a good education can get ""stuck in Iraq.""King responds by saying, ""That a right-wing blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt. I live in a National Guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career -- military or otherwise.""-- FOX News Channel's Martin Hill contributed to this report."

Obama's policies	"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" February 11, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: The 61st annual National Prayer Breakfast -- one speaker getting even more media attention than President Obama, Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon Dr. Benjamin Carson giving his biblical interpretation of taxes and health care.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. BENJAMIN CARSON, JOHNS HOPKINS NEUROSURGEON: We spend a lot of money on health care, twice as much per capita as anybody else in the world, and yet not very efficient.You make $10 billion, you put in a billion. You make $10, you put in one. Of course, you got to get rid of the loopholes.(APPLAUSE)CARSON: But now -- now, some people say -- they say, Well, that's not fair because it doesn't hurt the guy who made $10 billion as much as the guy who made $10 -- where does it say you have to hurt the guy? He just put a billion dollars in the pot! You know, we don't need to hurt him!(END VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: Was Dr. Carson's speech inappropriate based on the location and the timing? Former congressman Allen West joins us. Good evening, sir.ALLEN WEST, FORMER CONGRESSMAN: Good evening. How are you doing, Greta?VAN SUSTEREN: Very well. And as you may have noted, that Dr. Carson is a world famous neurosurgeon making those comments has caused somewhat of a controversy among some because they were made at the prayer breakfast. Your thoughts on that, sir?WEST: Well, I don't think it should cause any controversy whatsoever. I thought that we lived in an America where you could have freedom of speech. And I believe that the doctor gave his assessment of some of the policies that involve his profession in the health care profession, and also talking about the culture of and the relationship of government to the individual.Now, I think what has everyone upset is that he violated the unwritten rule of being an African-American male and he criticized the policies of President Obama, which I can somewhat understand, having been on the other side of a lot of attacks, as well.But if you go back to September of 2012, there was the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Emanuel Cleaver, who gave an incredible statement saying that if anyone else were in the White House other than President Obama, that they would be marching on the White House, and that the President Obama knows that he is given a deference that would not be given to a white president.And we were talking about the incredible 14 percent unemployment rate in the black community. And I think that we cannot continue to go on believing that all we can do is ask the president what his favorite color is and continue to have these softball interviews. We have to start talking about the policies that are failing this country, and I think Dr. Carson -- hat tip to him for having that platform, being able to challenge those policies.VAN SUSTEREN: What do you think President Obama thought sitting there?WEST: Well, I think he felt for the first time, Someone has stood up to me, because pretty much so, he's been given a free pass, just recently, we saw in that ""60 Minutes"" interview. So it has become rather Pavolvian if you continue to reward this type of behavior and these type of failing policies without any type of challenge that comes from the media.And furthermore, when you see him going out and about, he continues to be placed in front of, you know, the fawning audiences that just clap, and they become campaign rallies more than anything else. So I believe that it is time that we have to start standing up and challenging the president, and let's see what happens tomorrow night with the State of the Union address.VAN SUSTEREN: Congressman, let me go on to another topic. We have so much to talk to you about -- I want to hear from you about. But I want to ask the viewers, do you think Dr. Carson's speech was inappropriate for the prayer breakfast or not? Go to GretaWire.com right now and tell us what you think about his speech at the prayer breakfast.All right, Congressman, now I want to talk to you about SEAL Team 6 member who was shot -- who was the one who shot and killed Usama bin Laden. Tonight he's making new accusations against the Obama administration, the former SEAL telling Esquire magazine that after 16 years in the Navy, and having now left the Navy, he had no job, no health insurance and no protection for himself or his family. He says he fears for their safety, and he wants to draw attention to the Pentagon's lack of support for troops once they come home.Congressman, what do you think about this Navy SEAL's accusation?WEST: Well, interestingly enough, General George Washington, President George Washington, had a famous quote that said future generations will just their service to this country by how well we treat her veterans. And this is an example of exactly that.You know, when you are in between that 15 to 20-year point, if you terminate your service, you do get a little bit less as far as a pension. And when you get to that 20-year point, that's when you are considered retired.Myself, I served 22 years. I got a 55 percent pension. But the thing is that when you look at Tricare benefits that this gentleman should have - - we should not have an administration that is going and trying to take away those Tricare benefits.And here is the gentleman who took away the world's most hated number one terrorist, and we should be treating him a whole lot better, and we should make sure because we are allowing the Muslim Brotherhood to pretty much operate freely in the United States of America, that he is protected and his family members are protected. And in transitioning out, he should have definitely had an incredible job opportunity waiting for him.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, I think when people get wind of the fact that he's looking for a job, you know, he ought to have one. You know, he has done the job that, you know, we all -- he and his colleagues and so many in the military, but he and his colleagues in particular, the job of getting Usama bin Laden, something that we all so desperately wanted to have happen.Congressman, thank you, sir.WEST: I will tell you...VAN SUSTEREN: What? Go ahead.WEST: ... he went above and beyond the call of duty.VAN SUSTEREN: Indeed, he did, and so many do. Thank you, sir.WEST: Thank you, Greta."	['Carson', 'Allen', 'Black', 'Obama']	[]
