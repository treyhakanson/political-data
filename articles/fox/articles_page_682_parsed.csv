This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, Hillary Clinton back on the campaign trail after a health scare sidelines the candidate and the political reporters are saying it could not come soon enough as a series of dramatic new polls show Donald Trump gaining traction across this country and in the states that matter.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. We are now just 54, 54 days away from a race that -- well, ending, that not long ago seemed to be Mrs. Clinton's for the taking.But the last week has produced the kind of headlines that has some Democrats, for lack of a better term, how you say freaking out. NBC News tonight saying Clinton is back on the trail and not a moment too soon for Dems.The Hill sent out an alert late today saying, ""polls darken for Democrats"" and even the liberal website, Vox, called this, ""A brutal series of polls for Mrs. Clinton.""In just moments, Charles Krauthammer is here on what's happening with these numbers and why. Plus pollster, Larry Sabato, is here with what he sees as the real worry for the Democrats.But first, Trace Gallagher, is in our west coast newsroom tonight with new data from the critical battleground states. Hey, Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS: Hey, Megyn and breaking right now, Real Clear Politics has just moved Colorado from leans Clinton to a toss-up. That's significant because it means the Electoral College projections are continuing to get much tighter.This week alone, Real Clear Politics has moved New Hampshire, Michigan and Colorado into the toss-up category. Back on August 15th, Hillary led in New Hampshire by eight, Michigan by seven and Colorado by eleven points.Also concerning for the Clinton campaign is that in just in the past 48 hours, RCP has Trump taking the lead in the all-important battleground states of Florida and Ohio. Both are well within the margin of error, mind you.But it's important to remember, the last time a candidate lost Ohio and won the presidency was 1960 and no president has lost Florida since 1992.The simple math here is that over the past month, 72 Electoral College votes have moved from Hillary Clinton's column to the toss-up column. So as of today, the map has Clinton with 200 electoral votes and Donald Trump with 164.Here's the concern for Trump. You need 270 to win. For Trump to hit the magic number, he would have to win the same 24 states that Mitt Romney won in 2012, which is certainly not a given, and he'd also have to win both Ohio and Florida.If you plug in all of the Real Clear Politics averages of where the candidates stand at this very second, even with Hillary Clinton's current dip in the polls, the Electoral College projection map gives her 293 electoral votes to Trump's 195, but the needle is moving in the right direction.KELLY: Trace, thank you.Well, as you heard, Hillary Clinton still holds the edge on the electoral voting map, but all the momentum seems to be with Trump. My next guest says if Clinton doesn't want to lose this lead, she better come roaring back and in a big way.Larry Sabato joins me now, the founder and director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Larry, good to see you. So when you look at New Hampshire, Michigan, Colorado, all moving from lean Dem into a toss- up.Not to mention Trump taking Florida and Ohio. It tells me that she suffered an electoral disaster over the past 30 days. Was it basket full of deplorables, the health? I mean, what was it?LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF VA CENTER FOR POLITICS: Actually, I think the last week was the most damaging. Most of these new polls were conducted at the time when she had said basket of deplorables and then you had the liable omission about her health problem.I think it was very damaging to her. The first part of the month was simply losing all of the convention bounce, which was expected. I mean, that was a big convention bounce she got. She wasn't going to keep it.But she's deteriorated further because of the things she did last weekend.  It's hurt her. I know the Clinton team doesn't believe in pushing panic buttons, but I think they ought to at least test it out.Because if they continue to deteriorate and they are getting close to the 270 mark, they've got to be worried about that and they're going to --KELLY: They're falling from being above 270 and she's fallen down below like dangerously close to it.SABATO: Absolutely. Look, if they don't increase the enthusiasm among the base Democratic voters especially minorities and also young people who, by the way, are flaking off to the third-party candidates, not criticizing the third-party candidates, but they are coming in second.KELLY: They do not care that Gary Johnson doesn't know what Aleppo is.  They still are going for Gary Johnson with big numbers. I want to ask you about that because we see -- a Fox News poll came out today and we see this often now, the two-way race and four-way race.The one between Clinton and Trump and the one with the two other candidates. And Clinton does better, according to our Fox News poll, if the other candidates are in. She does better if they are in.She's got a one-point lead over Trump with the other candidates in. If you take the other two candidates out, Trump is beating her by one point. So what does that tell us?SABATO: Well, Megyn, actually, most polls show exactly the opposite. I've become convinced that especially in the swing states, Gary Johnson, believe it or not, is hurting Clinton more than Trump. Why?Because he's become a parking space for so many of those millennials who supported Obama but don't like Clinton. And, of course, Jill Stein mainly takes from Clinton. She takes almost nothing from Trump.KELLY: Jill Stein who is going to make Madea Benjamin of Code Pink her secretary of state. I have to ask you this quickly. So when you look at the numbers and talk about the millennials, what rule could President Obama or Bernie Sanders play for Hillary because they are unleashing him in Ohio for her this week?SABATO: Surrogates help but they alone cannot pull you across the finish line. Only Hillary Clinton can get across the finish line and she's got to show vigor. She's got to show endurance and stamina, not just on the campaign trail but in those debates coming up.KELLY: She's got to fight for it. She took August off. She was just waiting and watching Trump hoping he would implode and he didn't. She's suffering. Larry, great to see you.SABATO: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Well, this poll surge is not only becoming a topic for the headline writers, it's also becoming an issue on the campaign trail with both candidates today talking about what's going on.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The polls are coming out. We're leading in so many polls, I can't tell you. I don't know where to begin, but that's a good feeling.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've always said that this is going to be a tight race. I've said it from the very beginning, whether I was up, down, it didn't matter. Those are the kinds of presidential elections that we have in America at this point in our history.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Dr. Charles Krauthammer, syndicated columnist and a Fox News contributor. Charles, good to see you. Let me start with her comment there. Up, down. The thing is, she sort of downplays the huge lead she had over him just three weeks ago. I mean, it's not an understatement to say that many neutral, political pundits were saying he was done.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, remember, he has that terrible several weeks right after the convention that were the worst of Donald Trump and then her campaign strategy, since she didn't really have a positive message, it's really hard to come up with an edge.I don't think that she can come up with an answer. She gave a speech today where she said I've got 38 proposals on my web site. It's about the most wooden thing any candidate could say.KELLY: Right, whoever goes there.KRAUTHAMMER: What their strategy has been is to demonize. Trump, you've seen the ads, the new ad that came out just this week, showing a leading Republican politicians saying that Trump is unstable, et cetera.So it was to make him very negative and unacceptable, beneath the threshold to be president. That's the strategy. But what happened was he ran into a very effective -- she ran into a very effective counterstrategy from his new team, Trump's new team which was warm and cuddly, kinder and gentler Donald Trump.So it counteracted that image. There he was in a black church, there he was speaking about compassion for illegal immigrants with a foggy message and then you've got a few days ago this enormous new entitlement for child care.Here's a guy who cares about African-Americans, cares are minorities, about immigrants, cares about mothers and women. So you run into that new Trump at the same time that she is escalated the rhetoric about the old, the bad, the bully Trump, talking about the basket of, you know --KELLY: Deplorables.KRAUTHAMMER: -- deplorables, who are irredeemable, anti-American extreme, and the two images are clashing and his strategy is working. Hers is not.KELLY: It's interesting because I mean, Trump supporters have been with him from the beginning. But to those people who rejected him because they felt he was a bully or anti-Hispanic or anti-black or women or what have you, do you think they are actually starting to be persuaded that what they saw for all those months was not real?KRAUTHAMMER: I'm as puzzled as you are by the phenomenon and I can tell by the tone of your question. I wasn't sure it could be done, but he has shown a lot of discipline. He has not gone off-script. Look, what was the worst of what happened in the bad time for him in the three weeks when he sank in the polls?It was his insensitivity to the gold star parents, the idea that this guy has no empathy. The entire campaign for Trump for the last three weeks has been an empathy emphasis.He cares about this. He cares about that. The tone, he's not shouting and all of that contributes to a makeover. Now, do I believe it? I don't know. Do other people believe it? It seems to be having some kind of an effect.Maybe not that people are rallying to him, but those who are completely opposed to him perhaps are opening their minds and given the fire she's been under on the honesty issue, on the transparency issue, they may be looking at the race through a different lens.KELLY: Let me ask you this as a psychiatrist. If I've been told that a child with two bad parents will try to idealize the least bad one, they need to have one, right?So do you think this is a situation where the mom figure is really not being, let's say, straight with us about how long she has? And I don't mean to say she's dying.I just mean her health has clearly been one of the many issues on which she has not been totally forthcoming and so it's like, OK, I have to choose one of these people and as she starts to look worse, he necessarily starts to look better.KRAUTHAMMER: I would agree with that, but without the psychiatric context but I don't play one on TV. Look, I think it's rather simple. You've got two choices.They are the two most unpopular candidates we have seen in our lifetime.  It's mostly people who are voting to prevent the other from getting in.  She has looked really bad with all of the new e-mail stuff, with all of the transparency issues.I don't think health has anything to do with this at all and then he's been this new image and perhaps that is -- look, I think the one thing that is true, in an age of social media, the life expectancy of a memory, of a sound bite, of an image, is very small.Sound bites are small, images are small, and there's no past, no memory.  So I think it turns out there's a new persona with only two months to go.  That's the question that this campaign hinges on.KELLY: It's incredible to think about. It' good news for Anthony Weiner.  Anyway, I've got to go. Great to see you. Go ahead, Charles.KRAUTHAMMER: Some memories are ineradicable and that's one of them.KELLY: It's great to see you.KRAUTHAMMER: OK.KELLY: Meantime, a defiant Donald Trump. Tonight, he went off script and back on the attack and in just moments we'll hear from his campaign and a top Hillary supporter on the new controversy catching fire.Plus, new developments on the Clinton e-mail front after Congress sent a subpoena to the FBI. The powerful chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Jason Chaffetz is here on the next steps in his investigation.And then, America's media took a stunning hit today. Howie Kurtz and Noah are next on how this issue is going to shape this election.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is it fair to just say the liberal media is out there trying to make a case against Donald Trump? The media was front and center of Sunday morning playing it over and over and over when Hillary Clinton tripped. She faces a double-standard every day right, left and center.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, The Washington Post just published a new interview with Donald Trump and gone was the toned down candidate we've seen in recent speeches.First, Trump went after CNN's Anderson Cooper saying, quote, ""I don't think Anderson Cooper should be a moderator because he works for CNN and over the last couple of days, I've seen how he behaves. He'll be biased. Very biased.""Then he issued a warning for Mrs. Clinton saying, quote, ""If she treats me with respect, I'll treat her with respect. If she doesn't, I'll reciprocate.""And when asked if President Obama was born in the United States, he said I'll answer that question at the right time. I just don't want to answer it yet.Trace Gallagher live in Los Angeles with more on how Mr. Trump may be turning up the volume -- Trace.GALLAGHER: You know, many would argue, Megyn, that Trump's rapid fire incendiary comments throughout the primary helped him win the GOP nomination. Others like Charles Krauthammer say his recent surge in the polls is part and parcel of the new more disciplined, more restrained Donald Trump.But in recent days, there are signs of the old Trump making cameo appearances. For example, on Sunday when Hillary Clinton collapsed at a 9/11 event, Trump initially gave her a get well wish, but last night, Trump took a shot at Clinton getting overheated. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I don't know, folks, do you think Hillary would be able to stand up here for an hour and do this? I don't think so.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Then there was the confrontation at a church in Flint, Michigan, where Pastor Faith Green Timmons interrupted Donald Trump for attacking Hillary Clinton. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Hillary failed on the economy, just like she's failed on foreign policy. Everything she touched, didn't work out. Nothing.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Trump, I invited you here to thank us and not give a political speech.TRUMP: OK. That's good.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Trump responded on ""Fox & Friends"" by saying the pastor was nervous and shaking because she was planning on interrupting him the whole time. Hillary Clinton defended the pastor as a rock for her community.When hacked e-mails of Colin Powell showed the former secretary of state called Trump a national disgrace, Trump shot right back on Twitter, quoting, ""I was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq equals disaster. We can do much better.""And when told that Senator Harry Reid said that Trump is not slim and trim, Trump said, ""Reid should start working out again with his rubber workout pieces,"" a reference to the exercise band that Reid snapped last year causing him to fall and break his ribs and bones in his face -- Megyn.KELLY: Thank you, Trace. Joining me now with reaction, Trump campaign national spokesperson, Katrina Pierson, and Clinton supporter and DNC Committee man from New York, Robert Zimmerman. Great to see you both.Let's talk about where Trump is, Katrina, because he's been on the straight and narrow for a few weeks and his poll numbers are doing great. Why start in on Anderson Cooper who is a very solid journalist and who is not even on the air this week, he's out of town.And why start threatening to go after Hillary and why for the love of God won't he say that Barack Obama was born in the United States?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2106 NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Well, here we are 15 months later and still there are many in the media that expect Donald Trump to be some robotic politician and that's just not who he is.He was asked to respond to Colin Powell's comments and he did. He's not going to let the media determine what he talks about and when and that's exactly what you're seeing. Mr. Trump is going to be Mr. Trump.He will respond when he feels like it. And it's just really unfortunate that Mr. Trump simply wants to focus on his policy, which is something that everyone has been saying they want to hear and yet we hear these diversionary tactics by the Clinton campaign and the media which is CNN.KELLY: But before I move on to Robert, what about the -- Barack Obama being born here? Because this is what his campaign manager and his chief surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, said about that issue because Trump had been pushing the birtherism thing saying Barack Obama wasn't born here. He wasn't born in Hawaii. This is what they said a couple of days ago.  Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: He believes President Obama was born here. I was born in New Jersey. He was born in Hawaii.RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR: Donald Trump believes now that he was born in the United States, but that issue was raised originally --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When is he going to say that this president --GIULIANI: I believe it, he believes it, we all believe it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He does? Are you --(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: So why wouldn't he say it when asked tonight?PIERSON: Well, simply because he doesn't talk about that anymore. First thing is Barack Obama is not on the ballot.KELLY: That is not going to fly.PIERSON: It is going to fly, Megan, because this is completely irrelevant to the election cycle.KELLY: It's not completely irrelevant. You have a lot of people in this country, in particular, African-Americans, who feel that that position was a racist position meant to de-legitimatize the president. I'm taking no position on this.I'm relaying to you what they've said. His own campaign manager came out and said that he has shifted his belief on this and now when asked directly he refuses to confirm that. Why?PIERSON: And you also have a poll in South Carolina that shows that Mr. Trump is pushing 30 percent on African-American support and Hillary Clinton --KELLY: That's a dodge.PIERSON: No, it's not, Megyn. I'm telling you. Mr. Trump has said he is not going to talk about it. I've given you the answer. You want to know why?KELLY: I just don't want to answer it yet. Robert, what do you think?PIERSON: The media is not going to force Mr. Trump to say anything that he is not ready to say.KELLY: The media didn't for him to come out and take a position being a birther, but he did.PIERSON: That came out of Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2008.KELLY: Given the chance to question her about it, we certain will, but right now we have you. Go ahead, Robert.ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, CLINTON SUPPORTER: OK, let's be clear, it's not about asking Donald Trump to be robotic. It's about asking him to have honor and decency and show respect for the truth. And that's really what is at issue here.KELLY: You support Hillary Clinton.ZIMMERMAN: I beg your pardon?KELLY: You're talking about respect for the truth and you're a Hillary Clinton supporter and the American people think that she's not truthful, to put it gently.ZIMMERMAN: Megyn, you're dodging the issue. We're talking about the fact that Donald Trump will not discuss whether -- may I finish my point, please? We're talking about Trump and refusing to recognize that President Obama is an American citizen and that reflects -- despite what his supporters say. It's disgraceful, racist and dishonest.For that manner, Pastor Timmons, like a typical bully and coward, he stood up and defended him when he was being heckled and when Pastor Timmons told him to respect the rule of what the church has asked him to do. He backed down and did what he was told.PIERSON: He was very respectful.ZIMMERMAN: And then when he left the church and was on Fox & Friends this morning, he lied about her. He called her a nervous mess, like a typical bully, when he was confronted, he backed down. When on his own, he went out there and tried to antagonize.KELLY: Go ahead, Kat.PIERSON: He made an observation. He felt like the woman was nervous.  That's not an attack. That is not racist, George. You weren't there. How can you sit there and say that? You weren't there?ZIMMERMAN: The media covered it.KELLY: He said she was so nervous, this is on ""Fox & Friends,"" she was a nervous mess and so I figured something was up, really.PIERSON: How is that an attack and how is that racist?ZIMMERMAN: I'll tell you why it's an attack because Pastor Timmons defended him at the church when he was heckled and in fact --PIERSON: She couldn't be nervous?ZIMMERMAN: And then when he left, like a typical bully, he started to malign her. But here is the bigger point, today, Donald Trump Jr. tried to minimize the holocaust, the unspeakable loss of six million lives by comparing it to a bad day on the campaign trail.KELLY: I don't know about that, Robert.PIERSON: George wants to divert from other things, like Hillary Clinton --ZIMMERMAN: First of all, it's Robert. Secondly, we're talking about --PIERSON: We're talking about, George, you brought up Donald Trump Jr. so I want to address that. He talked about the gas chamber because it's a form capital punishment right here in the United States as recently as 2010 --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Can I jump in? You lost the audience now. They don't know what you're talking about and that's my job to make sure they do. Donald Trump Jr. tonight said that -- he defended his comment saying that they would be warming up the gas chamber if Trump had said -- I'm trying to find the original comment. In any event, he made some comment about, if my dad did that, they would be warming up the gas chamber for him.ZIMMERMAN: That's right.KELLY: And then you have the anti-defamation -- he acted like Clinton, he would be getting the gas chamber. The Anti-Defamation League said that's inappropriate. You don't make references to the holocaust. He said it was actually a reference to capital punishment.We are going to leave at that. He's tried to clarify it. Great debate.  Great to see you both.I do workout. I don't have time. My job, my kids. That's really all I do, but I do workout.New drama with the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal as the powerful chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Jason Chaffetz sends a subpoena to the FBI and is now threatening the guy who set up Hillary Clinton's server.  Showdown at the House and Jason Chaffetz is here to explain, live.Plus, the American media took a huge hit today. We'll show you what it means for the 2016 race when Howie Kurtz and Noah (inaudible) join us next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I have really good news for you. I just heard that the press is stuck on their airplane. They can't get here. I love it.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Fifty-four days to go and Americans trust in the media has never been lower. Today, les than one in three Americans say they have some trust in mass media, but it's conservatives driving the drop with more than half of Democrats but only one in ten Republicans, well, about that, expressing trust. And who's proud of the plummet? The Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Listen.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)TRUMP: I had a lot to do with that poll. I think I had a lot to do because I've exposed the media. I really am -- I'm very proud to say that I think I had a lot to do with that poll number.(END AUDIO CLIP)KELLY: Moments ago in New Hampshire, Trump again showing not a ton of regard for the media starting in events before they arrived, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I have really good news for you. I just heard that the press is stuck on their airplane and they can't get here. I love it. So they're trying to get here now. They're going to be about 30 minutes late. They called us and said could you wait and I said absolutely not. Let's get going. Let's get going, New Hampshire.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, two journalists who have doggedly followed the median in this election cycle, Howie Kurtz, host of ""Media Buzz"" right here on Fox and Noah Rothman, assistant online editor of Commentary Magazine, great to see you both. So, you know, the problem is, without the press, we don't get to see him. He doesn't get as much coverage. They are not there to hear what he has to say and he can't get his word out as much, which he does like to do, but it's always fun to beat up on the media. Howie, what did you glean from these results?HOWARD KURTZ, ""MEDIABUZZ"" HOST: You know, I talked to Donald Trump tonight an interview for Sunday's ""Media Buzz"" about this very point and as he portrays it, the media has been so relentlessly dishonest toward him, in his view, that he's had no choice but to push back. And in effect, he thinks it's his credibility or the media's credibility at the same time, Megyn, in this incredibly polarized campaign.Hillary Clinton is sending out fundraising letters saying there's media bias against her so, no wonder this is part of the reason that public confidence is dropping. We're getting it from both sides.KELLY: Noah, do we know why faith in the media has dropped among conservatives? I realized Trump think it's because he has criticized the media relentlessly, but there are also a lot of conservatives who feel that the media fell down on the job in vetting Trump.NOAH ROTHMAN, COMMENTARY MAGAZINE ASSISTANT ONLINE EDITOR: Yeah, precisely, that has a lot to do with it. That number bottomed out among Republicans. Last year it was in the 30s, somewhere in the low 30s. This is just -- very few Republicans have any faith in the press and it has a lot to do with, A, Donald Trump saying that media people are horrible by their own terms and in press rallies but also per Republicans who didn't vote for Donald Trump who think that he got a lot of unfiltered coverage that he did not deserve, that resulted in the prominent position he had in the primaries.So, yeah, on both sides of that aisle, from among Republicans, there is no faith in the press.KELLY: So how is this, I mean, Howie, you look at -- it's the lowest point in 44 years, or in Gallup's polling history, the faith in the media. And so how does that play into this election?KURTZ: Well, first of all, I have to say, if you look at those numbers, the media were a stock. I mean, you'd have to sell it. That's how bad those numbers are. And it's a result over the years of self-inflicted wounds, bias, blunders, sensationalism, superficiality, so a lot of it is on us. It plays into the campaign because when we try to fact check the candidates, people don't believe us. When we try to report o the candidates, people think they are not getting the straight scoop from us.And so, also I have to say, although we should take most of the blame, our profession, there are a lot of partisan folks out there who don't really have any interest in journalistic (inaudible). They want us to either back their candidate or trash the other candidate or both, and so it's hard to please everybody when it's such a high bipartisan environment.KELLY: But then you have people like this woman over on MSNBC, Noah, who thinks that -- can we please play that thought? That it was bias for the media to show her falling down. We don't have it. We played it in the tease. She was like -- how did she put it, Hillary's --- she stumbled and the media kept playing it over and over. It was like the woman passed out. She did not appear conscious. She's supposed to be commander-in-chief. What were we supposed to do? Ignore it?ROTHMAN: And that's what's really absurd about the whole situation. She shunned the press. She kept the media cameras away. Her pool was kept in an enclosed space so they couldn't cover her. That video was surreptitiously filmed. If you had press pool on her, you might have had something that was a little more explanatory.They would have had to come up with something that made sense. Instead it was heat stroke, then pneumonia, then chronic dehydration and then sort of a flu and back to pneumonia. This is all of the simulation because they kept the press at arm's length. They have nobody else to blame but themselves for the situation.KELLY: No, and for keeping us in the dark and giving us different stories, of course we wondered and of course we're going to cover that. I mean, the woman wants to be president. We didn't know whether she's all right. Good to see you both.KURTZ: Good to see you Megyn.KELLY: And do we know that? They say we do. Also tonight, Donald Trump goes on Jimmy Fallon's show and what happens next may win him a lot of new fans. We'll show you.Plus, the powerful chairman of the House Oversight Committee Jason Chaffetz is here next and what he expects after he did this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JASON CHAFFETZ, R-UTAH: I've signed this subpoena. We want all the 302's and we would like the full file. You can accept service on behalf of the FBI?JASON HERRING, ACTING ASSISTAN FBI DIRECTOR: Certainly.CHAFFETZ: You are hereby served.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHAFFETZ: Will the FBI provide the Congress the full file with no redaction of personal identifiable information?HERRING: I cannot make that commitment sitting here today.CHAFFETZ: Them I'm going to issue a subpoena and I'm going to do it right now. So let's go. I've signed this subpoena. We want all of the 302's and we would like the full file. You can accept service on behalf of the FBI?HERRING: Certainly.CHAFFETZ: You are hereby served.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was the chairman of the House Oversight Committee serving a subpoena to the FBI in dramatic fashion on Monday, as Congress looks into how the feds handled Mrs. Clinton's e-mail investigations and whether they have been forthcoming with congressional investigators looking into it. But the story did not end there. Joining us now live tonight, Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the Oversight Committee, great to see you, sir. Thank you for being here.CHAFFETZ: Thanks for having me.KELLY: So that was an attempt to get the FBI to give you an unvarnished look at the interview and the notes and who they talked to. But today you had a beef with this guy, Brian Pagliano, who set it up the private server in Mrs. Clinton's New York residence, who you served a subpoena to come testify in front of you and he blew you off?CHAFFETZ: We sent him a second subpoena also to provide us the document that he supposedly got from the FBI that gave him immunity. He also blew that off. And you know what, subpoenas are not optional in this country. You have to comply with them.KELLY: Why wouldn't he want to appear before you?CHAFFETZ: I don't know. That's why you give people an opportunity. We can investigate anything at any time. It's how we do the checks and balances in this country. It's why we have this subpoena power to compel people to come before Congress. Sometimes they talk, sometimes they plead the fifth but you got to provide that opportunity and I expect them to show up.KELLY: Now they say the Democrats on the committee say you are trying to harass him. You're trying to humiliate him, that's what his lawyer said too, that this is only a political show and you're trying to drag this guy before you who has already asserted that he wants to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights.CHAFFETZ: No, we have a constitutional duty to also provide oversight at the executive branch. This is one of the largest security breaches in the history of the United States State Department. Classified information that could get people killed. Of course we're going to talk to the very person who essentially pulled the trigger and used the BleacBit and tried to destroy documents that were under subpoena. Of course we've got questions for him.KELLY: Julie Roginsky is here now and I want to get to her in one second. Hi, Julie.JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi.KELLY: She's with us, Fox News contributor and Democratic analyst. Yes, go ahead. Say it loud, say it proud.ROGINSKY: Thank you. Wow, what a welcome.KELLY: But before we get to you, I want to ask you whether this is going anywhere, right, because this is -- what is it all going to amount to? Because you're trying to talk to the people who set up the server and you're trying to talk to the FBI but the FBI has already issued its ruling. She's not going to be indicted.CHAFFETZ: But people that when Director Comey came before the oversight committee, he also said he looked at nothing that Hillary said under oath and also look at all of the things that Congress has asked for that haven't been provided.KELLY: So he was looking into whether she lied to you but you are looking into that.CHAFFETZ: Yes.KELLY: Julie, what say you?ROGINSKY: Well, I say, look, I understand you're exercising both your right as a congressman and your right as a partisan politician to make hay out of a political issue, but you know he's going to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights so, the whole purpose of this theater (ph) is to drag him up to the hill -- we've seen it done by both parties, it's not just limited to what you're doing -- drag him up to the hill, make him invoke his Fifth Amendment rights, once again, say somebody under Hillary Clinton's auspices (ph), invoked their Fifth Amendment rights, and you get applauded by the conservative base and we all go on with our lives and that's what this is about.I mean, look, I'm not a lawyer but it's very obvious to me that this person is not going to testify. You know it. Your fellow members of the oversight committee know it, and yet you're asking him to do this purely for the political theater. The political consultant in me applauds you, but the person who pays taxes in this country says why are you wasting tax payer money on an outcome that you know is going to end up being where it's going to be.CHAFFETZ: You don't actually know if they are going to do that until they actually get there. I want to hear it from him himself. He's also has immunity so, I want to look at that document. It begs the question why...KELLY: Does he have immunity from all committees in all circumstances?CHAFFETZ: That's what I'm going to ask him. I mean, that's probably what we need to ask these witnesses. You can't just say, well, nobody is going to want to talk to us because it's going to be inconvenient and just let it go. If you get into that game of just saying, hey, you can just blow off the Congress, you don't need to show up, nobody is going to show up.KELLY: OK, before we go, is this hurting her because her numbers are falling and as the e-mail scandal that we hear about day after day?ROGINSKY: Her numbers are falling not necessarily because of this. Her numbers are falling over the last several days and you know why. She had this horrible health incident. She's been off the trail and Trump has had the field t himself. Let see what happens after next Monday's debate and where those numbers are. But I will say to this congressman, if you heard from his lawyer tomorrow that he's going to invoke his Fifth Amendment Rights, would you still beg him to testify? Would you still insist that he testify?CHAFFETZ: He needs to come and testify.KELLY: We'll have to leave it at that. Good to see you both. Up next, Donald Trump on Jimmy Fallon and we have a clip.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: New questions tonight as Hillary Clinton returns to the campaign trail, days after a health scare at the 9/11 memorial service on Sunday. A video showed Mrs. Clinton leaving the event early and appearing to collapse as she was getting into a van. Hours later, she emerged from daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment looking like much better.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How are you feeling, Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Great. Great.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you talk to us for just a second? Give us a little statement?CLINTON: It's a beautiful day in New York.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Now, some are pointing to pictures of Hillary leaving the event and then hours later leaving Chelsea's apartment saying that woman on the right was not Hillary Clinton at all. It was a body double. Brian Kilmeade is co-host of ""Fox & Friends"" and author of ""Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates."" I could not believe how much circulation this actually got.BRIAN KILMEADE, ""FOX & FRIENDS"" CO-HOST: It's unbelievable, and you know what, just to back everybody, you have me do it. So let's go to (inaudible) which we just saw a moment ago where the circles he used to be around football plays and quarterbacks. Now, it's around buttons and suits -- pantsuits. He is there saying are the conspiracy theorist, that this one woman has a different body composition.One is slimmer than the other. They're saying one has more wrinkled skin than the other, one has higher cheekbones than the other and if there's one shot with her standing and her feet are kind of out, kind of like Ronald McDonald...KELLY: Pointed out.KILMEADE: ...and they say that Hillary Clinton never stands like that. The best theory is, there's no Secret Service. Secret service, as we know, cannot guard body doubles. So Secret Service are not allowed to do that. That makes sense. The child runs up and says hello while (inaudible) has to run up.KELLY: Except it doesn't make any sense whatsoever because it's absurd because that's clearly the same person who has the same stomach and the same skin and the same everything.KILMEADE: This is why you would not star in ""Murder She Wrote"" because you would have blown the whole plot in the first seven minutes and you have 25 minutes to film. I agree with you, however, this did not go away. If you see the comments underneath these stories, they build on it in a way I couldn't think of.KELLY: I can feel the Twitter lighting up right now telling us that we are wrong and you know, you know what us, because we're not buying into this.KILMEADE: I'm going to answer this real quick, Scott Baio is the MVP. He put it and tweeted out, ""Does anyone know the new Hillary Clinton impersonator that looks like her body double? Where is she?"" Another person in (inaudible) goes, ""I'm in Los Angeles."" So, Scott Baio blew the lid on this, now go find Joanie and our life will be complete.KELLY: She loves Chachi. In the wake of the Hillary Clinton health scare madness, this happened at a local station and we didn't want you to miss it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We begin with breaking news about Hillary Clinton's death. Hillary Clinton's doctor has just revealed the presidential candidate has been diagnosed with pneumonia.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Oh, it's bad. Live TV, you say stupid stuff.KILMEADE: Right, not me, but others.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: No, listen, Joe Torres I watch him every day and everybody in New York knows WABC is usually the number one station. Remember Roger Grimsby and Bill Beutel. You grew up watching them. Joe Torres said that -- he should have used the word health and Megyn the amazing thing is...KELLY: Not dead, she's alive.KILMEADE: If you said that, James would stop you and say something and you'd never be in...KELLY: And fix that.KILMEADE: You said they'll fix that. He went the whole show, nobody fixed it until the end they said he misspoke, but you know what he meant.KELLY: He clearly did misspeak. I mean, you have to laugh a little because as a news anchor, you know, you do say stupid stuff. You're my witness.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.KELLY: And it's embarrassing and then you have to correct it.KILMEADE: Again, I don't.KELLY: OK, well, just to make it right. Now, something happened tonight on the ""Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon"" involving Donald Trump, and watch what it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIMMY FALLON, HOST, ""THE TONIGHT SHOW"": Can I mess your hair up?(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: The answer is yes but the people in New Hampshire where I'm going to be in an hour from now, I hope they are going to understand.FALLON: You said yes.TRUMP: Go ahead.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FALLON: Yes! Donald Trump everybody.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Good for him.KILMEADE: Another reason why Jimmy Fallon is great and another reason why they say Donald Trump does have a sense of humor and humility about him. Am I right?KELLY: Absolutely right, and I would say that Jimmy Fallon is great and also he copied me.KILMEADE: What do you mean?KELLY: Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Come here. It's not that combed (ph). I actually comb it back.KELLY: Oh, I see. That's not receding hairline there.TRUMP: I know it's not there. It's a tiny, tiny bit of receding.KELLY: It looks good.TRUMP: I am getting a little bit older. It's not that bad. You're a little surprised.KELLY: I am.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That's from 2011. Trump has a great sense of humor and he has the ability to be self-deprecating and if he can show more of that, he may be contrasted starkly to his opponent.KILMEADE: Who has yet to show it, but maybe that's the October surprise, the sense of humor.KELLY: That's the thing because behind closed doors, they say she is funny.KILMEADE: How surprised would you be -- have you heard her behind closed doors?KELLY: Yes, absolutely.KILMEADE: How many doors are there? They get smart doors of nine layers you walk through all the way through with biosphere (ph)? I have not seen that.KELLY: If he can bring that, I mean, not like the hair to the presidential debate, but if he can bring a sense of humor and find a way to make people laugh, that will be huge for him. You know she won't take that risk.KILMEADE: Because you know her goal is to get -- unnerve him and get him angry to make him look like a bully. So, it doesn't matter what he says.KELLY: That's right. She wants angry Trump.KILMEADE: Right.KELLY: Mr. Kilmeade, thank you sir.KILMEADE: Thank you very much.KELLY: I'm going to do it, too. See you. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So let us know what you thought about the show tonight. Go to facebook.com/thekellyfile and follow me on Twitter @megynkelly. Let me know what you think. This is Dion.DION: I think I lost my ring.KELLY: Everyone needs one of these.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Figuring out now that lead story how America is changing, we have Charles Krauthammer having come up with three -- three, I got it -- there major reasons the USA is going over to this (inaudible) joins us now from Washington.And before we get to that, any quibbles with my memo?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: No, I think the basic point is right, clicking on the gay marriage decision.This is a recapitulation of what happened 40 years ago with the abortion decision. You can disagree or agree with the policy itself, but the fact is they went completely outside the constitution. And it's not so much that they created it right, is that by issuing the decree, in this case, to legalize gay marriage everywhere as in the abortion case. It took the issue out of the political arena, meaning that the people either express through referenda or through their legislatures can no longer pronounce themselves on the issue.Ruth Bader Ginsburg who, ironically, was one of those who ruled for gay marriage. She said before she has sent it (ph) to the Supreme Court as a criticism of the abortion decision that it prevented a stable social settlement of the abortion issue which at that time was headed and they reform direction, which is exactly what was happening with gay marriage, and yet the Supreme Court steps in while the country is moving on an issue, making a decision state by state, democratically the way the constitution wanted it and says no more debate, no more decisions. Whatever you've -- whatever laws you have or state constitutions you have, they are invalid. We decide the law of the land.O'REILLY: But that's not what the constitution says. It's clearly a delineation of the three branches of government. Supreme Court is not supposed to make law, and they are. But here is the -- this is even .KRAUTHAMMER: Well that's my point.O'REILLY: Yeah, this is even worst. This is even worst. They got two justices who perform gay marriages. These judges in this country can, and then they vote on (ph). That's a farce. They should have recuse themselves and look, you know, ""We perform these marriages, we believe in gay marriage, but we know that the court has to look at it in at somewhat objective way and evaluate both sides of the story. We're in capable of doing that because we've already thrown into it. So we're going to recuse."" That would have been the honest thing to do.KRAUTHAMMER: But the issue is -- and even the policy -- the chief justice dissent indicated that, you know, on the policy had he beaten state legislature, he pretty might have supported gaybies (ph) or gay marriage. But he says it's not our job .O'REILLY: Yeah, this is.KRAUTHAMMER: . to pass legislation.O'REILLY: Right.KRAUTHAMMER: Our job is to decide what's constitutional and to decide whether anybody else can decide. And he said that's not what we should have done in this case.O'REILLY: And these guys know it, that's the thing. That's what really troubles me. Each of these nine Supreme Court justices know they're not doing what they are compelled to do by the constitution, they're not.OK, three reasons why America is heading for a secular paradise. Number one?KRAUTHAMMER: You try to get me into a Rick Perry situation here? Number one is Charles Darwin. And this is been a secular -- the secularization of the West is as phenomenon at least 150 years old and the main reason is the rise of Science. We could spend a whole hour on that but it's happened everywhere.The remarkable story about America is that we are the least secularized. The pews in the churches in Britain and France, Italy are empty. They are not empty in America. So that's an interesting for. We had become more secular without a doubt, but nowhere near where the rest of the West is.O'REILLY: No. But the science has not been able to prove the existence of any kind of force that would create the universe other than a DNA (ph). They have not.KRAUTHAMMER: I mean, look -- But that's not the point. The point is, whether logical or not or whether you can produce an argument or not, it is a fact that the secularization of the West is a direct result of the rise of science and you might say the narrowing of the areas of ignorance and uncertainty that we had for centuries.O'REILLY: I only have a minute left so .KRAUTHAMMER: Whether or not is justified or not as a separate issue.O'REILLY: I only have a minute so .KRAUTHAMMER: . but it's a sociological fact.O'REILLY: OK. 30 seconds on number two, 30 seconds on number three, too.KRAUTHAMMER: Number two is that the left -- the second or left realizing it wasn't going to win on politics decided to march through the cultural institutions, the universities, the media, Hollywood. And number three, the reason that's important is young people no longer are raised by their parents. They get outside influenced through their ears, through the internet, on television has never before in human history, 68 hours a day, the left controls the culture and the culture, in the end, drives the politics.O'REILLY: And the parents have abdicated their child rearing responsibilities.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, abdicated or not, they cannot resist the influence of the culture because of the technology for no other reason.O'REILLY: All right, Charles Krauthammer everybody.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight. After days of campaign trail turmoil from battling a Gold Star family to rehashing old controversies, Donald Trump's closest advisers say big changes are coming as a huge haul of new polls give us a revealing new look at the state of this race less than 100 days out from the election.Good evening and welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly.  Exactly seven days after the end of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Hillary Clinton is seeing her biggest polling bounce in nearly six weeks. And that is not all. In multiple battleground states, critical to winning the White House, new polls now show Mrs.  Clinton is leading. In Florida, she's up by six points. In Pennsylvania, a state Trump wants, she's up by 11 points. Michigan, she has a nine-point lead.Lots of white working class voters there, considered to be Trump voters, but she's up 41 to 32 percent. And in New Hampshire, a whopping -- yes, wow. Seventeen points in that state there. We have a big lineup for you tonight including Larry Sabato from the University of Virginia Center for Politics. He's got new projections state by state. And then Bill Bennett, former education secretary and host of ""The Bill Bennett Podcast"" weighs in on the state of the race.But we begin with senior national correspondent John Roberts reporting from Portland, Maine, as a Trump rally there is just wrapping up. John.JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, you know, the campaign was really pushing back hard against this idea of some sort of intervention. I mean when we were with you last night, we cast it more as sort of a strategic recalculation or redirection of the message. But it's clear that somebody has gotten into Donald Trump's ear because in two events that he had in Florida yesterday and again here in Portland, Maine, today he was absolutely for the most part strictly on message.No forays into those tangential impulsive eruptions that have gotten him in to so much trouble since the convention. What he did today really was he told people here in the crowd what he would do, should he become president.  And then as Republicans have been asking of him time and time again, really kind of laid into a prosecution of Hillary Clinton's record and that of the Obama administration. Particularly zeroing in on a couple of issues, one of them being the creation of ISIS. Listen to what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The Obama/Clinton foreign policy has handed huge portions of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and other areas to ISIS.  Okay. Huge portions. We don't know. Is ISIS coming into our country?(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: Another area that Trump focused in on was Hillary Clinton's interview with Chris Wallace on ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"" over the weekend and how what she said didn't really seem to match what James Comey said she did.  Listen to how Trump cast it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If I ever did that interview and if I ever gave that answer, I want to tell you I think I'd get the electric chair, I swear. I think I would.  It would be headlines all over the world. It's true. Double standard.  This is a quadruple standard.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: One ardent Trump supporter came up to me after the speech and said the headlines should be that he stuck to the script. Another fellow who told me before the rally that Trump is his best hope, he believes, to win the presidency over Hillary Clinton, but he's just not looking presidential. He came up to me and said he really did a good job. And, Megyn, he even managed in the speech here in Portland today to not mention you. So that is an improvement over yesterday -- Megyn.KELLY: Excellent. John Roberts, thank you.Joining us now with more, Larry Sabato, who just updated his projections for the Electoral College vote, which his crystal ball has been looking at for months now. Larry, good to see you. And really the shocking thing about your update is it hasn't changed. Your projection has not changed in months now. Some states moved a little like, this one's more likely Trump.  This one's more likely Clinton. But tell us what the bottom-line is.LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UVA CENTER FOR POLITICS: The bottom-line is Hillary Clinton, 347 electoral votes. Donald Trump, 191. And, Megyn, you're absolutely right. While we've fiddled with a few states and increased or decreased their likelihood to vote for one or the other candidate, the bottom-line numbers have been the same since March. We don't rely simply on polling. Polls go up, and polls go down. And right now Hillary Clinton's got an incredible convention bounce. But some of that will fade quickly.KELLY: Mm-hmm. And so I mean obviously you need 270 to win. So you have her winning by a lot. I mean would that be considered a landslide if she pulled in those numbers?Not a landslide, but a very healthy win, no question about it. And, remember, it's early August. Lots of things happen. But Donald Trump has got to make some things happen.KELLY: Yes. So that's my question to you.SABATO: Yes.KELLY: The only states that you moved like this one is looking maybe a little bit more Trump, was Pennsylvania, like a little, you thought. And then you thought Virginia, Arizona, Georgia, and Utah and Colorado all moved a little closer to Hillary. So what does Trump need to do? I mean what kind of -- given what you put into your mix, what does he need to do to change these numbers?SABATO: Megyn, I only see two issues that can actually elect him and a couple of paths in the Electoral College. The two issues are the economy, which he should be talking about morning, noon, and night, but somehow doesn't get around to half or more of the time. And, of course, terrorism.  Those are the two things that can elect him because the incumbent administration is held responsible for both of those.KELLY: Mm-hmm.SABATO: He's got to focus like a laser on both of those every day. Today was a good start, but is it going to continue, or is he going to lose focus again?KELLY: In your history of studying these elections, Larry, has somebody who is, you know, looking at the type of polling that Trump is looking at and looking at these likely projections on an Electoral College map as you were showing, can they turn it around? Has that happened? Well, you know, he's got 100 days left, but he's got some time.SABATO: Yes. The patron saint of losing candidates, Harry Truman, turned it around in 1948.KELLY: Mm-hmm.SABATO: So, you know, if we hear in late October Donald Trump invoking Harry Truman, well, we'll know that that's his chance to win and also that he probably isn't going to.KELLY: We'll wait and see how that folds out. Larry, wait, before I let you go, I've been wanting to ask you this question. Are you related to this My Pillow guy? Look. Look. Do you know him? Every time I see him, I think of you.SABATO: I think he's a distant cousin, and he has never even given me a free pillow, Megyn.(LAUGHTER)I'm also distantly related to Antonio Sabato who was at the Republican convention. We are almost twins. We've got the same six-pack and everything.KELLY: I was thinking the same thing when I saw him and you. Larry, thank you.SABATO: Thanks.KELLY: I've been dying to ask him that.Joining us now with more, Bill Bennett, who looks nothing like Larry.  Great to see you, Bill. So, here's my question for you. So you heard Larry. He's a straight shooter.  BILL BENNETT, HOST, ""THE BILL BENNETT PODCAST"": Wait, wait.KELLY: What?BENNETT: Wait. Three mypillows.com. Three.KELLY: Are they good? Do you recommend them?BENNETT: They're fabulous. I don't look like anybody, but I love my My Pillow.KELLY: Who knew? There you go. And like, they pay for ad space, and they didn't even pay for this. All right. So the question is whether, you know, you heard Larry say what he thinks Trump has to do to turn around those polls and get himself back on the streets. But many people believe Trump should not do that. Trump should be Trump. Your thoughts?BENNETT: Well, Trump should be Trump, but Trump should be Trump on the issues. And I would remind everybody that no one has voted yet. Hello?  The thoughts of his demise, the announcement of his demise and political death are premature. I was talking to your researchers, too, before the show, Megyn, your excellent people. About July 25th, Donald Trump had a lead, according to 538, you know, Nate Silver, 51 percent chance of winning the election. Now it's what? August 4th, August 5th. I mean things change, and things change fast.KELLY: Right.BENNETT: So let's remember that.KELLY: That's absolutely right. I was just looking at that myself. One week ago, the Real Clear Politics average had Trump up two points. Now, eight days later, he's six points behind. So it's an eight-point swing in the average of polling, which means Trump had a very bad week, but it doesn't mean he's done.BENNETT: Right. That's because a lot of the American people are saying, I don't like him, and I don't like her. And there's a lot of people in the middle. And what Trump needs to do is -- I agree with Larry -- stick to those two issues about ISIS and the economy. 1.2 to five percent growth in the second quarter. The only president in history not to have more than three-and-a-half percent growth in any single year. And I would add a third I to that, and that's immigration. But what he has to do is stop making people pay attention to his liabilities and make them pay attention to her liabilities.KELLY: Mm-hmm. If we see sort of a straight and narrow Trump, right, for the next couple of months, like on those issues, not making, quote, unquote, ""gaffes,"" is that all it takes? You know, do you think that's all it will take for him to change his numbers and win?BENNETT: No. I think it will take some argument, some serious arguments about those issues. And I think, as I was saying to somebody the other day. He said, you know, you wrote the book of virtues Bill Bennett. How can you be supporting Trump? And what I say is, I understand how you feel about some of the things he said. But it may be better to lower your standards on things the guy says temporarily than to lose your country permanently.Just think what the stakes are. Think about the Supreme Court. Think about foreign policy. Think about the economy. These are very serious matters. Our friend Paul Ryan reminds us we only have a very few years to turn back this economy. So he needs to make the case on those issues. But he can still be Trump. I don't think Trump ever stops being Trump.KELLY: Mm-hmm.BENNETT: -- said of Edmond Burke, he had the gift of always being himself.  I mean, if he starts acting like George Herbert Walker Bush, it won't happen.KELLY: We're going to know, yes. Good point. Bill, it's a pleasure.BENNETT: Always. Thank you, Megyn. Thank you.KELLY: Sweet dreams. I'm just picturing Bill tonight. I'm getting one.  My pillows are too, like big. Do you ever have -- they're like overly fluffy. It's like this is unnatural. You know, he should send me one for free after all this. I don't think I'm allowed to ask for that.Moving on, we are also tracking new questions tonight about whether Hillary Clinton's fingerprints are all over one of the more controversial deals of Mr. Obama's entire presidency. The reports that we paid 400 million bucks in cash to Iran in a cash-for-hostages trade.Charles Krauthammer is here on that.Plus, the larger media today lost its mind over questions of whether Melania Trump is an illegal immigrant. Howie Kurtz and Governor Mike Huckabee are next on how this started and what it's all about.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MELANIA TRUMP, WIFE OF DONALD TRUMP: I follow the law. I follow a law the way it's supposed to be.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Developing tonight, we are watching the fallout from a day long media frenzy over the question of whether Donald Trump's wife, Melania, is in this country illegally. Ironically the investigation started after ""The New York Post"" dug up some decades old nude pictures of Melania from when she just started her modeling career in New York City. Then some journalist said, that's a story I would like to be assigned to, and started digging and digging and digging.And Trace Gallagher was one of the ones who raised his hand. And he is here with the details tonight. Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Only looked at them once, Megyn.  Look, there is still no concrete evidence that Melania Trump has ever misrepresented her immigration status. And in fairness, one of the reporters bringing this information to light has had issues with Melania Trump before. But there are certainly inconsistencies in the various statements Melania has made over the years. For example, Trump says she first came to New York in 1996, but that nude photo shoot you talked about of then Melania Knauss, was taken in New York in 1995 for the January '96 edition of the now defunct Max Magazine.For Melania Trump to have legally worked in the U.S. in '95, she would have needed an H1 B visa, which is valid for at least three years. But in her own words, Melania Trump suggested she wasn't here on a long-term visa but rather a temporary visa, telling Harper's Bazaar Magazine, quote, ""you follow the rules. You follow the law."" Every few months you need to fly back to Europe and stamp your visa. After a few visas, I applied for a green card and got it in 2001. But immigration lawyers say if she truly was here on a visa that needed to be stamped in her own country every six months, she would not have been authorized to work in the U.S.And if she lied about intending to work, it's visa fraud, which could jeopardize her current citizenship even though she's married to a U.S. citizen. The Trump campaign is standing by Melania's statement, which reads, quote, ""I have at all times been in full compliance with the immigration laws of this country, period. Any allegation to the contrary is simply untrue."" And tonight, a partner in the Paris modeling agency that Melania worked for in the mid-90s is backing up her claim, saying Melania was working in the U.S. on a legal, long-term H1B visa and that she's mistaken about needing to get it stamped every few months.  Immigration records could clear this whole thing up, but they cannot be released without Melania Trump's permission -- Megyn.KELLY: Wow. Trace, thank you.Joining me now, Howie Kurtz, host of FOX News ""MEDIA BUZZ."" So they're hot on the trail of the most relevant issue to voters. You know, you got to tip your hat, whether she had the thing stamped or had an H1B visa. And you know, America awaits the answer.HOWIE KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIA BUZZ"": What? Sorry, I was distracted by those old modeling photos.KELLY: Well, she's a beautiful woman.KURTZ: This Melania story is so totally overblown. And we were actually having a debate about what kind of visa she had in 1995 and whether she was allowed under the terms of that visa depending on what it was to do some modeling work on the side. Who cares? There's no evidence that she didn't become an American citizen legally, and it's kind of sad that it grew out of this sheer exploitation of publishing these old nude photos.KELLY: And there's only going to be more of this, right? I mean you tell me whether this is just about politics and trying to get him for his stance on illegal immigration, and it's only going to get uglier between now and November.KURTZ: Right. Look, I get that illegal immigration is one of Donald Trump's signature issues and if it could be proven that his wife, who he didn't know at the time, of course, didn't come here legally, that would be news. That has not been proven. And you know, it's all about some anti- Trump animus in the press and getting at her husband. And you don't have to take my word for it. I've looked at a piece from Slate about this which actually just coming out and says, the story isn't about Melania. It's about her husband spewing hate against foreigners. In other words, we're using this somewhat overblown issue to get at him and Melania is just sort of a collateral damage.KELLY: A question for you about the nude pictures which appeared in ""The New York Post."" What's up with that because I mean did the Trump campaign complain about that? Do we know why those are appearing right now?  They're from, you know, a couple decades ago.KURTZ: I can't figure out who leaked it, how it got to ""The New York Post."" It didn't seem to draw a vociferous complaint from the Trump campaign, perhaps because they didn't want to draw attention to it. And I understand, you know, it's a tabloid and it sells on the newsstand, but she was a model. She sometimes posed a racy photos. We know this about Melania Trump. She is now a very different person, an asset in his campaign. And, you know, I guess some in the media just can't resist going back to those days, whether it's questions about her body or questions about, you know, the details of the visa.KELLY: Howie, great to see you.KURTZ: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Joining us now with more, Governor Mike Huckabee. Fox News contributor and a Republican presidential candidate. Governor, great to see you.MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you.KELLY: I mean, honestly, because there's not enough to discuss about what Donald Trump does.HUCKABEE: Yes.KELLY: They had to dig into Melania's visa history.HUCKABEE: Well, and she has been very clear that she did everything legally. They have not proved that any of that is untrue. This is just allegations. This is the dumbest thing I've seen the press do, and the press does some pretty dumb things. This may be up there at the top.KELLY: There, she for some reason has become some folks' favorite target.  You remember ""The New York Times"" had an article calling her a mannequin and a trophy wife. She's gotten hit before. Remember one of those Super Pacs put out the ad saying, is this what you want for your first lady? Now this with the nude pictures. Now they're going after the immigration status. What happened to just like what you leave the spouses alone?HUCKABEE: First of all, she's not the candidate. Second of all, she is an absolutely lovely human being. If you've ever been around her, you know that she is charming. She's amazingly intelligent. She's run businesses.  She's raising a son in a very responsible way. What more do you want out of somebody who could be the first lady of the United States?KELLY: So they don't like her.HUCKABEE: And she is a citizen.KELLY: Some on the mainstream press don't like her because, A, she's married to Donald.HUCKABEE: I hadn't noticed that. You're kidding.KELLY: They don't like her because she's married to Donald. Right?HUCKABEE: And I mean if we have to hate the spouse, I guess according to American politics, and also because she -- a lot of people don't like somebody who has chosen to be a full-time mom, unapologetically. She owns that she plays a more sort of deferential role in her marriage. They have a more traditional arrangement. Donald never changed a diaper. You know?  And that actually bothers some people, I would say some feminists on the far left in this country who feel like that somehow undermines the choices other women make.HUCKABEE: Well, one of the dumbest things about this is that they're talking about something that happened over 20 years ago, and she was in her 20s. As I say, she's not the candidate. Why don't we talk about Obama's college transcripts?KELLY: Or why don't we talk about Bill Clinton if we're going to talk about spouses.HUCKABEE: Yes. Or Obama's being in the chum gang, you know, when he was going --KELLY: I don't know what that is. Isn't chum what you give to the sharks to try to get them --HUCKABEE: No. It was back when he was in high school and college and they really, you know, smoked marijuana a lot, and it was a little group of guys.KELLY: Look at the governor, educating me on the Mary Jane.HUCKABEE: I'm going to have to help you out on this.  KELLY: Doesn't it usually go on the other way around when we're on this set?HUCKABEE: I'm more savvy than you think I am, Megyn.KELLY: I can see that.HUCKABEE: You'd be shocked at what I know.KELLY: See, I'm saucy, but I never did the drugs. That was never my --HUCKABEE: This whole thing about Melania, this is an absolutely manufactured story. It's ridiculous, and I don't think it's going to do anything but make people more supportive of Donald Trump and more sympathetic toward Melania.KELLY: Yes. That's right.HUCKABEE: And so --KELLY: That's right. Even if they could -- even if they could prove that she was in the country illegally back then, which it doesn't sound like they've got it at all, is that going to change a single vote? You think a single Donald Trump voter is going to say, he's a hypocrite. He didn't know her visa wasn't perfectly in order before he married her and made her a legitimate American citizen. Aha!HUCKABEE: That's the biggest thing that they have a responsibility to do is prove it. Prove it. And they haven't done it. She has categorically stated that she was here legally. We know now she's been a citizen since 2006. So what's the issue?KELLY: Yes.HUCKABEE: There isn't one. This is nonsense. It's classic reason why people hate the media.KELLY: Maybe we could talk about ISIS. You know, that actually might change some votes one way or another.HUCKABEE: Four hundred million dollar, you know, blood money with the Iranians in an unmarked airplane. Gee, that might be worth talking about.KELLY: Speaking of which, Charles Krauthammer. Great to see you, Gov.HUCKABEE: Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY: So, one of the biggest legends in Hollywood just waded into this presidential race. And Clint Eastwood did not hold anything back when it came to Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton and the state of this country.Brian Kilmeade joins us on that.Plus, the former secretary of state took a bit of a victory lap about the Iran deal during the Democratic National Convention. But now there are questions about this possible cash for hostages deal. Is she proud of that piece too? Charles Krauthammer is here on how she's handling that, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you know that was coming, and do you approve of it?HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, the White House has addressed this, and I think actually this is kind of old news.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER: From the World Headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: We are tracking a new headache for Hillary Clinton tonight as she deals with questions this week on whether there was a cash for hostages deal with the nation of Iran. And this takes on a whole new dynamic when you consider that last winter in the height of her campaign, she was letting people know just how fond she was of her role in that deal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And it wasn't just last winter. She was even taking a victory lap on the Iran deal just last week at the DNC.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Now we have to enforce it, and we must keep supporting Israel's security.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: But now that controversy has exploded over this $400 million middle of the night cash payment to Tehran, Mrs. Clinton doesn't seem quite so eager to embrace the deal. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today America learned there was a shipment of $400 million worth of foreign currency on a secret air cargo flight to that country. Did you know that was coming, and do you approve of it?CLINTON: Well, the White House has addressed this, and I think actually this is kind of old news.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That being said. Do you approve of it?CLINTON: Well, look, I think we know that the agreement has put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Republicans will say no way, no, how do you fork over cash to that regime?CLINTON: Well, that's because they want to continue to criticize the agreement.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Charles Krauthammer is a FOX News contributor and a syndicated columnist. Charles, great to see you. So, she wouldn't go so far as to say I disapprove of it. She just went to the same old thing that we've heard from President Obama these past 48 hours, which is, this is old news.  This is old news.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, she's obviously hiding from the issue, and it's because it brings up the larger issue of the Iran nuclear deal. But I mean you can pin a lot on Hillary but it's hard to pin the cash-for-hostages deal on her. It happened long after she left office, and I can't even imagine that she was in on any of that negotiation. What you can accuse her of, what you can pin on her is that she began the whole process years before with secret negotiations in Gulf states with Iran that led ultimately to negotiations taken over by John Kerry where he and Obama gave away the store, gave away everything.This, the cash-for-hostages deal was an addendum thrown in at the end. At the end, they were giving up everything. They were so desperate to get a deal, they were giving away all kinds of positions and demands that they had insisted on. I'm talking about Obama and Kerry, and one of them in the end was to give over cash and what was not even mentioned, a lot of Iranians who were spies and who were supposed to be jailed or we were asking for extradition were released in exchange for our hostages. So they got their hostages or their spies plus...KELLY: Yeah.KRAUTHAMMER: ...plus the cash.KELLY: But why do we have to keep pretending that it's not clear, that it was for hostages when we have the middle of the night payment, not in U.S. currency because of our sanctions, and then this testimonial from one of the hostages, Saeed Abedini, who came out today and said, guess what happened when we were waiting to leave Iran? Watch.SAEED ABEDINI, CHRISTIAN PASTOR RELEASED FROM IRAN: And you know, they told us, you're going to be there for 20 minutes, but it took like hours and hours. We slept at the airport and then I asked them why you don't let us go because the plane was there, pilot was there. Everyone was ready that we leave the country. They said we are waiting for another plane, and until that plane doesn't come, we never let you go.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And the understanding as we know what was on that plane, $400 million in cash.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, that's what happens when you exchange hostages for cash. It's called a ransom. We've all seen it in the movies. You wait for the other car to arrive with the cash, and then you do the exchange. This is very simple, and the fact that they deny it -- Obama did it with a straight face and with a kind of mocking tone -- shows utter contempt for the intelligence of the American people.KELLY: It's also a sign of deception. The ""Spy the Lie"" guy (ph) say, when you start mocking the question, that's one of the many tells that there's dishonesty or potential deception.KRAUTHAMMER: And the idea that it's old news, nobody knew until now that there was a secret exchange of cash. And, again, why cash? Number one, because it broke the law. We're not supposed to deal in dollars with Iran. It was a way to launder the money through Switzerland. And, second, because when you are distributing the money to terrorists, Hezbollah, Hamas, who would be killing Jews, and Americans and Europeans and others with that money, you give it out in cash it's completely unaccountable. This is obvious what's happened, and the denial, I think, is a real insult.KELLY: So, how big a deal do you think this is? You know, how big a deal is it, and how big a deal will it be, if any, in this election now for her?KRAUTHAMMER: I don't think it will have any effect on the election. As I say, her connection with this particular transaction, disgraceful as it is, is too --KELLY: But she's a Democrat. She was in the administration, you know, does what he does affect her, he, president Obama?KRAUTHAMMER: When he gave his speech at the DNC, which was the best speech of the whole convention, and then she came out and embraced him, that's when she locked herself into his legacy in an indelible way. That image did it. She is running as his successor. She is actually running way to the left of him on some issues because of Sanders, but she is running as the status quo candidate for the third term. That was an image that we saw. There's no getting out of it.So, in that sense, everything that happens that embarrasses the Obama administration or that elicits opposition and distrust by the American people is going to harm her. But of all the issues, there are a hell of a lot of others, the economy, the dealing with terrorism in general, the collapse of our position abroad, all of that, I think is far more telling than this particular incident just in terms of her political fortunes.KELLY: Charles Krauthammer, always great to hear from you. Thank you, sir.KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure.KELLY: Also tonight, what's up with the guy dressed in a soiled clown suit, parading around at night with a bunch of black balloons? Well, we'll show you what's up. Hide the children.Plus, president Obama had to answer questions today about why he gave a get out of jail free card to hundreds of inmates who still had years to serve. His answers, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Everybody on this set loves my pillow. I am the only one who hasn't -- our director, Scott, has six. Oh, they want me -- they want me to do the news. So developing tonight, there's new reaction to president Obama after he had to face the media and the music today about his record-setting release of hundreds of federal prisoners.Mr. Obama cut their sentences in a move that means he's now granted more commutations than the previous nine presidents combined. Trace Gallagher is covering the news conference for us. Hey T.G.GALLAGHER: Megyn, almost all of those set to be released are men. Most were serving time for non-violent drug crimes, and 67 of them were serving life sentences. Now, certainly toward the end of their terms, presidents tend to commute sentences and issue pardons at a much higher rate. But with an additional 214 commutations, president Obama has now cut the sentences of more felons than any president in the past 100 years.Obama has long stated that non-violent drug offenders should be given second chances, and that most were sent to prison under outdated and harsh sentencing laws. But the president, who favors much stricter gun laws, also gave clemency to some convicted firearms violations. Today the president was asked about that. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The fact they had 20 years earlier an enhancement because he had a firearm is different than a situation where somebody is engaged in armed robbery and shot somebody.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Critics also point out there is still 11,000 petitions for commutations pending, and the president hasn't moved as quickly as he'd promised in his 2014 clemency initiative. They also say that unlike a pardon, a commutation does not mean full legal forgiveness, which makes finding a job and restoring voting rights much easier. Mr. Obama says before he leaves office, he will pardon about the same number of felons as other presidents do. Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you. Joining me now with more, Heather McDonald, fellow at the Manhattan Institute and author of ""The War on Cops"" and Nomiki Konst, host of ""The Filter"" on Sirius XM Progress and founder of the Accountability Project, great to see you both. So Heather, let me start with you on this. So, what does this mean, 214 inmates, sentences commuted, including 67 life sentences?HEATHER MCDONALD, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE FELLOW: What it means, Megyn, is it completely explodes the lies that the president has been telling about the criminal justice system for the last several years. We've been hearing endlessly that there's a racist move afoot to lock away thousands of harmless sad sacks for nothing more than possessing a few grams of pot.The fact that there are so many of these commutes (ph) with federal gun convictions on their record, shows that in fact, it is very difficult to find the prototypical pot smoker out there. You ask an elderly resident of Harlem what she feels about a drug dealer on her corner with a gun in his waistband, and she feels completely threatened. She feels like she's under the threat of violence.KELLY: Nomiki?NOMIKI KONST, SIRIUS XM PROGRESS THE FILTER SHOW HOST: Well, Harlem is a very different place today. I don't know if you've been to New York recently, but the average prisoner in New York City -- we are spending $168,000 a year on the average prisoner. And a lot of these prisoners were locked up in the early '90s due to three strikes laws because they were caught with an ounce of weed. The majority of them where...KELLY: Heather's point is those are not the people who are being let out. These are people with violent -- with gun crimes on their records.KONST: They had gun possession, and it was a different time. It was 20 years ago. They weren't robbing banks. I mean, listen, the facts are the facts. This is a bipartisan issue now because we know that the costs of keeping people in prison are $80 billion a year. We know that the majority of these offenders are minor drug offenders that were locked up due to three strikes laws. It's a bipartisan issue.KELLY: Is that true, heather?MCDONALD: This is changing the subject. Again, if it were the case that we had so many of these truly non-violent drug offenders in federal prison, that would be the exclusive target of these commutations. You can't find them. In fact, drugs make up a minute portion of our prison population.KONST: Fifty-one percent of our prison population is made up of drug offenders due to marijuana use.MCDONALD: In the federal -- in the federal system, one percent are there for possession and that's only 12 percent of our nation's...KONST: That is not true at all.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Heather's been saying this issue. She's been studying this issue.MCDONALD: ...of the federal populations there for drug possession and most of those have been bargained down. That's only 12 percent of our federal -- of our prisoners, however.KELLY: But let me ask you this Nomiki, let me ask you this. OK, so this criminal justice reform has become an issue for both sides. You're absolutely right. Even the Koch brothers are -- they work with Van Jones and president Obama on criminal justice reform, right? But they seem to be more focused on not criminalizing minor drug crimes or not, you know, locking somebody up for -- especially addicts who, you know.But I don't know if that means we commute the sentences of people who are in prison for life, who have, you know, violent gun crime issues on their record.KONST: Well, I think the president was very clear that these weren't violent guns. These are people who are holding guns -- had guns in possession, you know, at a time when they were locked up in the 90s.KELLY: I thought the (inaudible) said that's violent. Don't they say that's violent when they say we have to ban all guns?KONST: Well, I completely agree with you. But let's keep in mind that in the early 90s, our crime record is half of what it was in the early 90s -- in 1990. We are in a completely different world today.MCDONALD: I don't understand the argument.KONST: Well, one thing to keep in mind here is in the early 90s when...MCDONALD: A drug dealer with a gun is terrorizing that communityKONST: Hang on a second, Heather. Heather, hang on a second.KELLY: Quickly, Nomiki. I got 10 seconds on and I'm coming up a breakKONST: Crime is down by half. The prison companies who lobby for this...MCDONALD: Because it's not going to weigh (ph), that's why.KONST: With $5.5 billion lobbying for this.  KELLY: Well, we didn't solve it, but I did learn something, so I thank you both. Brian Kilmeade is up next. Just don't miss it. Hot mess, it's going to be good.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, one of the most legendary names in Hollywood is handing an epic schooling to what he called the entitled millennials. In a new interview with ""Esquire,"" Clint Eastwood says we are living amongst a generation of scaredy cats, overly concerned with being politically correct.Eastwood also throws support a little bit behind Donald Trump saying, ""He's on to something because secretly everybody is getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That's the kiss blank (ph) generation we're in right now."" Joining me now, Brian Kilmeade, co-host of ""Fox & Friends"" and the host of ""Kilmeade & Friends"" on Fox News radio.BRIAN KILMEADE, ""FOX & FRIENDS"" CO-HOST: We're going to have to say blank a lot(CROSSTALK)...because Clint uses so few profanities. That's what happens when you're 86.KELLY: You just don't care.KILMEADE: Yeah. I mean he has his -- he talks to ""Esquire"" magazine with his son and at the end of it, they said let's talk a little bit of politics. At which time he makes it clear that he is not a Hillary Clinton fan. He says, ""I can't see hearing that voice for the next four years."" He doesn't want more of the same, and does like the fact that Donald Trump tells it like it is.KELLY: Yeah, but says he's not endorsing him. He said stupid things, but they all have, he says. And then he goes on to say that this is the -- it's another word for cat -- generation.KILMEADE: How about this? The Russian band had a first name that was jailed for a while. Look it up. It's the same...KELLY: I think another name for cat gets it done.KILMEADE: OK.KELLY: Yes, in any event...KILMEADE: Well, we have varied judges here.KELLY: He talks about, for example, Trump's comments about the judge whose parents were from Mexico and he said, look, it was a dumb thing to say, but Clint said effin get over it. I mean he lays it on the line in a very plain spoken way.KILMEADE: Right. You know what this reminds me of Megyn, as much as he's Clint Eastwood, the Hollywood legend, he is like every senior person in our lives. You notice your mom, your dad, your grandparents, wherever they are, they tend to all of a sudden just say it like it is.KELLY: Yeah, it's true.KILMEADE: They're not stressed. They're relieved. They don't have any type of regrets. They let it fly.KELLY: Can I tell you this, so my 100-year-old nanna just had to go in the the hospital because she wasn't feeling well. And the first thing she reported back was, that male nurse is looking at my can. So you're right.KILMEADE: Right. By the way, was he? We don't know. We need to check him first.KELLY: We're still looking into it. All right, so that's Clint. Secondly, you may be aware that the Olympics are starting in Rio, but not without controversy.KILMEADE: Yes. Let's start with soccer -- women's soccer. I think they're going for their fourth straight gold medal. They beat New Zealand 2-0, but that's not the story. Hope Solo is the story because she wants to be a mom and she's worried about the Zika virus. For a while she said I don't think I'm going. Then she finally does show up.But I don't know if you guys have it, if not, just picture somebody in a beekeeper outfit. Hope Solo had fun with all of the inoculations on her bed. The people of Brazil didn't like this.KELLY: Come on, it's not her fault they have mosquitoes that carry Zika.KILMEADE: Right. But they really got back at her, and it really made history. For the first time in the history of sports that I know of, modern sports, they might have done it in Greece, they chanted the word of a virus. They chanted ""Zika, Zika, Zika"" in the stadium.KELLY: Let's listen to it. Do we have that? I want to hear that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CROWD CHANTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Wow.KILMEADE: It's as if they're cheering on the virus.KELLY: The mosquito.KILMEADE: Right. I mean the first time I ever heard a cheer for a virus.KELLY: But she -- look, so she played -- to her credit, she was able to laugh it off. Not so much these athletes who are going to have to perform on the open seas in Rio where viruses, bacteria, and human feces are swimming around in what has turned out to be human sewage, you know, teeming through the waters.KILMEADE: In 2009, when they got this, Brazil said I'll fix all that and don't worry about it, and bottom line is we tried for these Olympics. We couldn't get it. Remember when Barack Obama flew over when he was just president. We lost it to Rio, who they said the only thing worse than the water is the air. They say three teaspoons of this air will cause you to get violently ill.KELLY: The air?KILMEADE: Worse than Beijing -- the air, the water. And by the way, they tell the tourists, don't put your head in the water. How do you feel if you're a swimmer and you're competing in the water?KELLY: I don't know, and there is some basketball team -- our basketball team is staying out on some luxury liner. They're like forget this. We're going to stay on a ship.KILMEADE: Really, it's Team USA. They're staying at the Silversea Silver Cloud. It's a 196-cabin, nine-deck super ship.KELLY: And I know, you got to say, we need to make lemonade out of lemons.KILMEADE: Right. It has seven-foot beds. These are multimillionaires. They're putting their career on the line for this. They don't want to walk out with problems. Australia for example has Andrew Bogut who's an NBA star. He is staying in the rooms without lights. He had to use Saran wraps to hang his own shower curtain. There he is.KELLY: OK, wait. But, listen, it could be worse because he could be living in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where they have a major issue right now, and, no, it's not Chucky.(VIDEO PLAYING)KILMEADE: It's Gags, The Green Bay clown. It is. It's true. It started at 2:00 a.m. on August 1st. Gags the Green Bay clown was spotted. He has sallow, empty eyes. He is walking around in a soiled unitard, and he has a wrinkled collar. He is scaring people, but according to the sheriff, he's not doing anything illegal. He looks like he will, but he hasn't struck yet. So here's the deal. I went to doing this called -- what's it called again?KELLY: Research.KILMEADE: Yes. I tried to research this. I'm going to start doing this all the time. And find out what is the fear of clowns? What's it about? It's actually got a name (inaudible) coulrophobia, that's it. Coulrophobia if you have a fear of clowns. The number one fear for Americans, public speaking. Second is -- second is --KELLY: Death?KILMEADE: Second is death. Third is fear of clowns. It's about fear of ghosts. Second is zombies. We fear zombies.KELLY: Really.KILMEADE: So if you're walking around and you see a clown and you shudder, don't worry about it. You have the third most common fear in America.KELLY: And yet we subject our young children to these guys, right? Like, here, he's going to touch your face and paint it. You're going to love it.KILMEADE: Don't worry, the big guy with the scary face has shoes that will explode, and we pay him to do that to infect your kids forever.KELLY: Gags is his name? Gags, that's the Wisconsin guy?KILMEADE: Stay away. Even though he hasn't struck yet, he could. Gags, the Green Bay clown.KELLY: Be afraid. Be very afraid. Brian Kilmeade, great to see you. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So, speaking of scary clowns, a few years back a bunch of people were visiting ""Fox & Friends"" and they were celebrating the anniversary of Chucky and they put on the mask and ran all over the building. Everybody was scared. I am running off to vacation for kind of two weeks, and it is a vacation, and I'll see you when I come back.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
