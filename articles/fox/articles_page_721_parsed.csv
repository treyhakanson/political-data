"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" August 5, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.TRISH REGAN, FOX NEWS HOST:  Big news breaking tonight on the campaign trail as Donald Trump comes out to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan.  And surprisingly, he's not the only one who got the Trump seal of approval.  In a move that could signal a new phase in Trump's run for the White House.  Welcome, everyone, to ""The Kelly File Special: The Road to November."" I'm Trish Regan, in for Megyn Kelly tonight.  For months the relationship between the Republican nominee and the nation's most powerful Republican has appeared tenuous at best.  But tonight, just days before Speaker Ryan's Wisconsin primary, Mr. Trump traveled to Ryan's home state to declare his support for the speaker.  But in a shocking move, Mr. Trump also endorsed two other prominent Republicans he's been butting heads with.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  We will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory. And very importantly, toward real change.  So in our shared mission to make America great again, I support and endorse our Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Paul Ryan.  Good.  He's a good man.  He's a good man, and he's a good guy. And we may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree, and we're going to get it done, and we're going to do a lot of wonderful things. He's a good man.  And while I'm at it, I hold in the highest esteem Senator John McCain.  For his service to our country, in uniform and in public office, and I fully support and endorse his re-election.  Very important. We'll work together.  I also fully support and endorse Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN:  All right.  In just a couple moments, we're going to be joined by Chris Stirewalt and Howie Kurtz to talk about what it all means for the party and how the media has been handling this.  But we begin tonight with senior national correspondent John Roberts reporting live from Green Bay, Wisconsin, where Mr. Trump has been holding his rally.  And John, it looks like McCain and Kelly Ayotte, they made out pretty well tonight.  JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, and Paul Ryan as well.  Let me first of all just assure Trump's supporters that Donald Trump has not completely changed his spots.  He's the same Donald Trump.  He called Hillary Clinton the queen of corruption, disgusting, just referred to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas.  So the old Donald Trump is still very much there.  But what's really, really different tonight Trish and I was really struck by this is when he was  talking, when he was leading up to the endorsement of Speaker Ryan, Senator McCain, and Senator Ayotte, the whole kind  of framework of the way that he's been talking about this election was completely different this evening.  You know, he's in the past talked about, well, I'd like to have the support of the Republican Party, but if I don't, I'm going to do it alone.  I mean, these were some of the things that he was saying in the preamble.  Quote, ""It's not about me or any one candidate. It's about America.""  He was reading from notes by the way, to make sure that he got all of this the way that the campaign really wanted.  He said, we've done something, all of us. I'm just a messenger.  And then he went on to say, I need a Republican Senate and House to accomplish all of the changes I have to make.  I think the leaders of the Republican National Committee, I think that the Ryan people, and I think that some of the others across the country looked at this and said, this is the type of candidate we want.  This is the type of candidate who is standing up as the leader of the Republican Party, the standard bearer.  He's talking about party unity.  We'll see if that lasts, Trish.  I mean, he's kind of gone down this road a little bit in the past only to veer off of it.  But I think just in the last 48 hours, maybe it was an intervention but a lot of people have gotten in his ear to say this is the message that you need to hit going forward.  And he's been right on message when it comes to attacking Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration and other Democrats.  So, again, we'll see how long it lasts-- Trish.  REGAN:  All right.  Thank so much, John Roberts.  So, what does this endorsement mean for the Republican Party?Joining us now right now, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor, and Howie Kurtz, host of ""Media Buzz"" on FOX News.  Howie, you know, he went a step further than folks thought he would there, not just endorsing Ryan but of course coming through from McCain and Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire.  Does this signal a turning point for Donald Trump and the Republican Party?HOWIE KURTZ, FOX NEWS HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"":  Come on, Trump looked about as enthusiastic as if he were endorsing the Zika virus.  I mean nobody is fooled by this papering over of the differences.  The fundamental and political and personal differences between Trump and Paul Ryan, Trump and John McCain.  As early as this morning, an adviser close to Trump told me, well, he doesn't endorse in primaries.  But clearly he was under pressure from his own people, from his own party, to stop the bleeding, by which I mean the negative media coverage, a lot of which has had to deal with this unseemly spectacle of GOP presidential nominee publicly feuding with the GOP House Speaker.  REGAN:  Well, Chris, if that's the case, is it going to cost him at all?  I mean, one would think, okay, it's going to bring in more Republicans.  But don't forget, he doesn't want to alienate his base at all.  CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  Well, in the narrow sense, this is a price that Trump is paying for having screwed up on the Khan family and his spat with them, the parents of the officer killed in Iraq.  So this is -- he has to pay this price.  He upset his party.  He made them angry.  They yelled at him.  They told him that they might drop their endorsement of him.  So this is sort of the price that he has to pay, but it works in --  REGAN:  Yes.  But let me just jump in there and say, you know, look, would it have been appropriate for him not to? I mean there was part of me that thought, okay, he's just stringing everybody along here.  At some point, he'll come through with Paul Ryan.  He just wants to give him a taste of his own medicine because, don't forget, Paul Ryan did the exact same thing to him, Chris.  STIREWALT:  Well, I'm sure it was in part Trish, an effort to belittle Paul Ryan and make this seem worse.  But also it served an important purpose for Trump.  They put this story out.  Remember, The Washington Post, which Trump forbids to cover his campaign rallies as a news outlet, he invited them in at the beginning of the week to make sure that it was clear that he did not endorse Ryan and that he was against McCain.  So he put this story out there.  It is a counterweight to the problems with the Khan family. So, this is in one sense, it's been a very bad week for Donald Trump.  But in another sense, he had this story as a counter narrative, and at the end, Paul Ryan was going to win anyway.  And now Donald Trump can claim some of the credit for that.  REGAN:  Well, there you go.  And I'm sure we'll hear from him on that front when Paul Ryan does win.  From a media perspective, what's your thought on the coverage of this thus far, Howie?KURTZ:  This past week, I have never seen anything like it.  This barrage of bullets, it's like the mainstream media put out a mob hit on Donald Trump.  Now, look, there were a lot of unforced errors here beginning with attacking a Gold Star family, wandering off message, holding rallies where he was re-litigating issues in the primaries.  Megyn Kelly, the disabled New York Times reporter.  But for all of that, there seems to be -- and with Trump dipping in the polls, which I know you want to get to, there seems to be a collective feeling in the mainstream media that the race is slipping away.  They're all that riding him off.  You have conservative pundits as well as liberal pundits calling him crazy or mentally unbalanced or acting like a child.  It is really intense.  REGAN:  You think they're kind of enjoying it.  You look at those polls and of course, we had the Fox News poll out recently.  But I would point out that throughout this entire process, polls have been pretty erratic and all over the place.  Granted, you know, the latest polls aren't great when you look at them from his perspective.  Nonetheless --  KURTZ:  It's August.  REGAN:  I agree with you.  There's still another 100 days to go, and anything can happen.  And we have seen, certainly, in this campaign that anything can happen, and he does make some dramatic comebacks and he may in fact do it again.  But are there commentators, are there journalists out there that are effectively dancing on his grave right now, that are enjoying this because it's kind of like I told you so?KURTZ:  I think there is a moment of vindication here, particularly for many of these conservative commentators who were never Trump in the primaries.  Now they feel like, see, we warned you if you nominated this guy, this was going to happen.  At the same time, I think that, look, Trump has been running against the President since the day he got in this race. That's not going to design his race.  But it leaves him with few defenders in the media when, you know, every single thing he does -- he threw a baby out of the rally whatever -- becomes the latest metaphor for how badly he's doing.  In fact, given the barrage here, Trish.  It's still a fairly competitive race.  REGAN:  All right.  Chris, can he change the story beginning tonight?STIREWALT:  Well, he planted the story.  He changed the story.  All of this gets it off the Khans, which is good, because that was a real dog for Trump.  But let's have been clear.  The polls have not been up and down. The polls have not been all over the place.  All of this huff and puff, this junk that people are talking about now, well, Trump is collapsing or this is happening, the polls haven't changed that much.  If you throw out the garbage polls that media outlets and politicians use when it looks good for them, if you stick with real polls like the FOX News poll, ""Wall Street Journal"" poll and other polls, Trump is down.  But this race hasn't changed that much.  Structurally, Trump has never been that far down, and he is within striking distance.  This isn't a collapse, the race just looks different now because it's after the convention.  REGAN:  And -- once you had those third party candidates into it, Hillary Clinton actually fares worse.  Anyway, still good to see you guys tonight. Thank you so much, Chris and Howie.  There are dramatic new developments tonight on Donald Trump's fight with a Gold Star family after the dad took his story to Pakistani TV.  This is just ahead.  Plus after a week of controversy on the campaign trail, some Republicans want the GOP candidate to change his message.  Marc Thiessen, Richard Fowler, and Boris Epshteyn are next on whether that could be a dangerous idea.  And then almost eight months after her last news conference, Hillary Clinton today agreed to take some reporter questions.  What do you know? Wait until you see how that one went, just ahead.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  Are you mischaracterizing Director Comey's testimony, and is this not undercutting your efforts to rebuild trust with the American people?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN:  All right.  As Howie Kurtz was just mentioning a moment ago, before the big news broke tonight about Donald Trump endorsing Speaker Paul Ryan, we were hearing reports this week suggesting some Republicans were hoping to have what they called an intervention with their candidate.  The list included RNC Chair Reince Priebus, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.  The goal would be to reportedly help Trump change his tone and focus on his opponent.  It all comes after a week in which we heard statements like these here. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  If Hillary puts her people on the Supreme Court, okay, like who knows?  Elizabeth Warren maybe will go.  Maybe.  Pocahontas.  Pocahontas. And those commercials were so false, just like Hillary's commercials. They're so false.  They're so false.  Like she's got the one with blood coming out of her eyes, and I meant her nose or her ears or her mouth.  But these people are perverted.  I said in New Jersey, they were dancing.  Those people that knocked down the World Trade Center, most likely under the Trump policy, wouldn't have been here.  But the reporter all of a sudden remembered it totally different from his story, and he was groveling.  I won't make the motions because if I do, they'll say something, you know.  Nobody is better to people with disabilities than me.  I spend millions and millions of dollars on buildings taking care of people with disabilities.  (END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN:  Okay.  So he was having some fun there.  Marc Thiessen an American Enterprise Institute and FOX News contributor joins us now along with Richard Fowler, nationally syndicated radio talk show host and senior fellow with the New Leaders Council.  And Boris Epshteyn, a Republican strategist and senior adviser with the Trump campaign.  Good to see all you guys tonight.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good evening, Trish.REGAN:  Boris, starting with you, regardless of whether this meeting is actually happening or not this weekend, it does seem as though people out there are trying to rein him in.  His endorsements tonight, they may be part of that effort.  So, let me ask you.  Does he need to be reined in, or do you fear it's going to cause him to lose some of the very essence of what makes him so popular with his base?BORIS EPSHTEYN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  He does not need to be reined in. There was no intervention.  Some unnamed source and Rudy Giuliani went out there and said that that term shouldn't have been used.  There's ongoing discussions by Donald Trump, with his family, the campaign and leading Republicans.  Of course, that's what makes a good campaign.  That's probably why Donald Trump who received 14 million votes in the primary, more than any Republican in the history of the GOP.  As he continues for the next 94 days, sort of winning on November 8, you will see that Donald Trump you've seen over the last year.  But of course you also see a dogged concentration on national security, on foreign policy, on the economy and showing the American people what a terrible candidate Hillary Clinton is.  REGAN:  So Marc, Boris is making the point that this is just politics as normal for the Trump campaign.  But it seemed as though, as we were heading into the convention in Philadelphia, Donald Trump was faring pretty well. In fact in one poll he was tied with Hillary Clinton, and now all of a sudden, he's struggling.  And in between that, you had the Khan situation and you heard some of those comments of course that were just made recently in Daytona Beach, Florida.  So does he need to focus his message a little bit more?  You've got an economy that's seriously struggling right now.  An international situation which is clearly in a form of chaos.  Does he need to focus on these two things and stay away from the rest of it?MARC THIESSEN, FORMER CHIEF SPEECHWRITER, PRESIDENT G.W. BUSH:  Oh, my gosh, he has something.  Look, the fact that, you know, the fact that the Republican presidential nominee just endorsed the Republican speaker and two Republican senators for re-election is not news.  The fact that it is news shows what a disaster the Trump campaign has been for the last week. This is a dog bites man story.  It shouldn't be leading our news story.  I mean, this is normal procedure.  But it just shows what a terrible week Donald Trump has had.  I mean if you think about the last week, what a target-rich environment this was for Donald Trump.  Hillary Clinton caught again lying about her e-mails on ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY."" Four Pinocchios from ""The Washington Post.""  Pants on fire from PolitiFact. Then we discovered that the Obama administration shift $400 million on Swiss Franc on a secret flight to Tehran.  He should have been talking about that.  Instead he spent the first part of the week fighting with a Gold Star family who lost a son in Iraq and then he spent the second part of the week fighting with Paul Ryan, John McCain, and Kelly Ayotte who criticized him for fighting with a Gold Star family.  If Hillary Clinton had scripted Donald Trump's campaign this week to distract from her troubles, she couldn't have done it any better.  REGAN:  I think Richard Fowler might agree with you on that.  Right Richard?  RICHARD FOWLER, NATIONAL SYNDICATED RADIO TALK HOST:  I absolutely do agree.  Donald Trump is like a dog chasing its tail.  I always seen over the past because it's nothing new.  Boris talks about how the campaign is going to be focused on national security.  And when?  That's the question everybody keeps asking.  Let me finish Boris.  The Trump strategists have over and over and over said, oh, he's now going to focus on Homeland Security.  He's now going to focus on this.  Then he goes back to misogyny. He goes back to attacking people with discrimination.  He goes back to talking about how much money he spent on retrofitting his buildings, which is part of the Americans with disabilities act as folks at home already know.  Donald Trump, he might be a billionaire, but he does not know how to run a presidential campaign.  A presidential campaign is about telling the story of the American people, and sadly he is not a good storyteller.  All the story is make America great again.REGAN:  Look, Boris, he's had some challenges this week.  I mean, you got to admit it.  EPSHTEYN:  Sure.REGAN:  You can't ignore the elephant in the room there.  He has had some challenges.  Can he recover now from this?  I think that's the question. We've got 100 days to go here, and anything can happen in politics.  He seems as though he's trying to pivot here tonight by making these endorsements.  Is it going to be -- and I know we said this before.  But is this going to be a different kind of Donald Trump from here on out?EPSHTEYN:  It won't be a different kind of Donald Trump.  You will see both sides of the spectrum.  There's two parts to this.  Donald Trump is an unbelievably strong candidate.  Again, the best candidate the GOP has ever seen by votes in the primary.  The other part is Hillary Clinton is a liar. She's not only someone who lies, she lies about lying as was just proven. And then you have to talk about the $400 million ransom paid to Iran. Donald Trump has been against the Iran deal from the beginning.  That's probably why he joined this rate, to make absolutely sure that that deal --  REGAN:  I mean these are big issues and you're absolutely right.  There's a lot for him to chew on there.  The other thing I'd mention to Marc and get your final thoughts on this is, I think we are in an extraordinary time where traditional politics has basically been thrown out the window.  And, you know, he has tapped into an amazing amount of anger and frustration in this country.  And it almost feels as like most Americans are saying or many Americans are saying, you know what?  Enough.  I want change, and I'm willing to take the risk that goes with that.  What do you say, Marc?THIESSEN:  I absolutely think that that's possible, and Donald -- but the problem is, is that Donald Trump wasn't talking about those things that Boris just mentioned.  He was talking about a Gold Star family.  He was talking about -- he spent the entire week fighting with these Republicans. When you send your kids out to a soccer game, you send them out, and you say, go shoot on the other team's goal.  He spent the entire week shooting on his own team's goal, and he's going to lose if he doesn't --  EPSHTEYN:  But that's not what actually happened.  THIESSEN:  But that's exactly what happened.  No.  You look at --  (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)REGAN:  He's going to listen to a lot of people right now for sure and get back on message because it's the economy, the economy, the economy, and national security.  Thanks so much, guys.  Good to have you with us tonight.  FOWLER:  Thanks, Trish.THIESSEN:  Thank you.REGAN:  Dramatic new developments today in the showdown between Donald Trump and the father of a Muslim soldier who died fighting for America.  Rich Lowry and Attorney David Wohl are next on what this dad said about Trump and what he said about America when he took his story to Pakistani TV.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN:  The father of a Muslim soldier who died fighting for America has touched off new controversy tonight after taking his story to Pakistani TV. In a new interview with his native country, Khizr Khan invokes Allah in his attack against the GOP nominee.  Pakistani news outlet Dunya summed up the Gold Star father's appearance by saying, quote, ""Khizr Khan says Allah makes people like Trump make such mistakes to discredit them permanently.""  In other words, Allah is against Trump.  I guess Allah is rooting for Hillary in this one.  Why did Mr. Khan feel the need to take his message global while repeatedly insisting he is done giving interviews?  David Wohl is an attorney and a Donald Trump supporter.  And Rich Lowry, he is here.  He is the editor of the National Review and a FOX News contributor.  David, starting with you, I mean the left had tried to hold up Mr. Khan as being totally above board.  But now he's out there talking to international media, Pakistani TV.  How much do you think this hurts him, his reputation, and Hillary Clinton for that matter?DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY:  Yes.  Well, there are certain things playing to his audience.  There's no doubt about that.  I mean, his audience is Muslim fundamentalists, no doubt, a lot of them in Pakistan.  But you know it. First at the DNC, he politicized his son's death.  Now he's putting it in the context of religious extremism, so I think it does put into context his whole speech at the DNC when he basically was off point when he said Mr. Trump wants a Muslim ban.  Mr. Trump wants a suspension of Muslim immigration from hotbeds of terrorism.  Everybody knows that.  I think Mr. Khan studied his proposal carefully, he would agree with him.  But you have to wonder at this point whether he's on the DNC payroll going global with this bizarre message that Allah is against Trump.  I mean, did Allah also cause Hillary Clinton to become a pathological liar and perjurer?  REGAN:  By the way, don't worry.  We've got more coming up on Hillary in just a moment.  But Rich, I mean, your thoughts?  I mean, it's one thing, right, for him to be criticizing Trump here in America.  It seems like a whole other thing when you start going over and talking to Pakistan TV and you start talking about how Allah is against Trump.  RICH LOWRY, EDITOR, NATIONAL REVIEW:  Well, first of all, I haven't seen the full transcript of this interview, but if the synopsis is correct, one, I disagree with his theology.  I don't think it's Allah who is making Donald Trump say these things.  I think Donald Trump is quite capable of saying all these things himself.  And my advice to Trump and the Trump campaign and Trump supporters would be to move on.  As Mike Pence said, you can't fake good kids.  Captain Khan was an American hero, a great patriot.   By all accounts, Mr. Khan does legitimately carry around a U.S. constitution in his pocket.  He gives away U.S. constitutions.  He and his wife are very involved in the University of Virginia ROTC program.  They honor those kids.  They encourage them to serve this country.  REGAN:  Yes.  But again, you know, clearly he has a message he wants to get out.  LOWRY:  This is a horrible week attacking his family.  And if I were a Trump supporter, I'd stop it right here.   REGAN:  He's got a message, Mr. Khan does, that he wants to get out, not just here in this country but obviously overseas.  And so, that's causing some people --  LOWRY:  But Trish, I mean, you would have to agree --  (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)REGAN:  But hang on.  First Rich, and then we'll go with David.  LOWRY:  Trish, you'd have to agree if your son goes to serve in Iraq and dies trying to protect other servicemen, that says something not just about him, but about your family.  And that's why it was a real mistake for Trump to fall into this trap and to attack this family.  And he should stop it, and I assume very smart, confident people have told him to cease and desist.  REGAN:  You know, we saw him -- we saw him, David, tonight come out and endorse not just Paul Ryan but also John McCain and Kelly Ayotte.  WOHL:  Yes.  He's on message, Trish.  REGAN: As I've asked some other of our guests here, is this a turning point? Is he getting back on message? Can he put the rest of these things behind him now?WHOL: Yeah Trish, you know something; absolutely it's a turning point. You saw a very professional, very polished guy tonight. You're going to see this stuff put aside. You're going to see him start focusing on Hillary Clinton, who when she's off prompter did what she did today saying, basically what she said that Jim Comey said that she was telling the truth. She short circuited.You're going to see a lot of short-circuiting on Hillary Clinton's behalf in the next 90 days. This campaign is just getting going, and Mr. Trump has a way of turning many controversies into rocket fuel for his campaign. And that's exactly what's going to happen right here. Count on it. This controversy is over and done with.REGAN: We'll be watching for it. David, Rich, thank you so much. I'm glad you mentioned Hillary because Hillary Clinton is doing something today, something that she actually hasn't done in roughly eight months. Our next panel is going to talk about what happened when Hillary Clinton agreed to take reporter questions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you mischaracterizing Director Comey's testimony and is this not undercutting your efforts to rebuild trust with the American people?(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: A rare moment for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail today. She took questions from reporters. Imagine that. You know, this actually hasn't happened since December 4th, 2015 in Fort Dodge, Iowa, nearly 250 days ago. And today, at an event for black and Hispanic journalists in Washington, D.C. Reporters made it pretty clear just how unique this moment was. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you for inviting me to address you today, and I look forward to taking some of your questions.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think on behalf of all of us, we encourage you to do this more often with reporters across the country. Especially those news organizations that travel the country with you everywhere you go.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: Well, Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin is in Washington where Mrs. Clinton also doubled down on some very questionable claims in her ongoing e-mail scandal. Jennifer.JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Trish, it's been eight months and one day since Hillary Clinton held a press conference. Today she answered questions from the National Associations of Black and Hispanic Journalists. One of the questions she received was to clarify remarks she made in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday's"" Chris Wallace, in which she said that FBI Director James Comey had said she was truthful in dealing with her e- mail server.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Director Comey had said that my answers in my FBI interview were truthful. That's really the bottom line here. What I told the FBI, which he said was truthful, is consistent with what I have said publicly. So, I may have short circuited it, and for that, I, you know, will try to clarify because I think Chris Wallace and I were probably talking past each other.(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN: But here is what Comey told Congressman Trey Gowdy under oath.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TREY GOWDY, SOUTH CAROLINE REPRESENTATIVE: Secretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her e-mails either sent or received. Was that true?JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: That's not true. There were a small number of portion markings on I think three of the documents.(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN: Clinton went on to explain today why she continues to say she never sent classified information.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: A classified document has a big heading on the top which makes very clear what the classification is. Director Comey made the point that the three e-mails out of the 30,000 did not have the appropriate markings, and it was therefore reasonable to conclude that anyone, including myself, would have not suspected that they were classified.(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN: In a poll conducted by the University of Chicago, more than half of the young white voters polled said that they believed that Hillary Clinton intentionally broke the law with her private e-mail server, but only 21 percent of African-American voters polled believe that she intentionally broke the law. Trish.REGAN: All right, thank you so much, Jennifer. Considering what a big deal the media makes over Donald Trump's challenging moments, why don't they seem to care more about Hillary Clinton effectively lying? I mean she wasn't forthcoming with our own Chris Wallace in her interview on Sunday. She wasn't truthful when talking about sending classified e-mails. And she continued to double down on her position regarding her server again today.So, why doesn't the mainstream media care? Tezlyn Figaro is a member of the National Association of Black Journalist and a former Bernie Sanders presidential campaign staffer. Alan Colmes is the host of the ""Alan Colmes Show,"" and Katrina Pierson is a Trump campaign national spokesperson. Katrina, I'm going to start with you. I mean, why can't Hillary Clinton just admit what she did was wrong and be done with it?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Well, you know, Trish, I think what we see today is exactly why Hillary Clinton avoids doing press conferences because she doesn't want to answer the questions. The entire case for her non-indictment is the fact that they can't prove intent.And the fact that she admits to any of those questions, then her case is blown out of the water. So she has to walk this very fine line and continue to repeat those lies hoping that the public, the mass public, doesn't find out the truth.REGAN: Tezlyn, when you look at the way the media covers Trump -- and they cover every little challenge he has along the way, some of which haven't been so little, some of which have been pretty big. But then you look at the way the media covers Hillary Clinton, and I would think, you know, as someone who had worked in Bernie Sanders' campaign, you might have been at times pretty frustrated that the media didn't make a bigger deal out of the e-mail issue.TEZLYN FIGARO, FORMER BERNIE SANDERS STAFFER: Well, sure. I mean we see with WikiLeaks, you know, that faucet of truth is still dripping loud and people continue to ignore it, that we see that there is bias within the media, particularly the liberal media. You know, what I would encourage my colleagues to do with the NABJ is instead of getting caught up in selfies and a coke and a smile, that we actually look beyond the speeches and look beyond the rhetoric and actually hold if Hillary Clinton is the president of the United States, hold her and every politician that addresses the body of black and brown journalists with the policies that they present and actually hold them accountable to those promises.One of the things that we've seen challenging time and time again is when you talk about a base of 90 percent of African-Americans who voted for president Obama and of course she's riding on that same hope, which she called the firewall, we look at that as a challenge because a lot of journalists can't ask the questions that they need to ask. They ask softball questions because they don't want to offend the readers.So we really want to get deep into what we should be asking, how we hold people accountable, and we have to start with asking those tough questions. Hillary Clinton spoke to the NABJ today and Hispanics...REGAN: You got to ask the tough questions, and by the way, she's got to answer them.FIGARO: She has to take herself outside of her comfort zone, make herself available like Mr. Trump has, whether you agree or don't agree his off the (inaudible) comments, whether you like it or you don't like it. He's made himself available to the media and she has to do the same.REGAN: Yeah, transparency -- transparency matters. Let me share with you, Alan, what Jack Welch tweeted a short time ago. Jack Welch of course, the former CEO of G.E., he said, ""How about blatant lying by first Clinton on Fox News Sunday regarding FBI and Obama on ransom payment if Republican MSMedia mainstream explodes.""In other words, if this had been a Republican that lied, if this had been a Republican, Alan, that had maintained her own e-mail server, there's no chance that Republican ever would have gotten away with it. Why does the media give her a pass?ALAN COLMES, FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The media is not giving her a pass. This woman by the way stood up between for about 11 hours speaking to Congress answering tough questions by hostile questioners. She went on Chris Wallace's show ""Fox News Sunday,"" no slouch in the tough question department. This narrative that she is somehow avoiding the media is just not true. She has been forthcoming.REGAN: She's bee forthcoming?COLMES: In fact, if Donald Trump were smart, he'd avoid the media more because every time he opens his mouth, he's not telling the truth.REGAN: I'm sorry, she's been forthcoming, Alan?COLMES: He's lying about an Iran tape. And, Katrina, you got in trouble for saying that Obama was responsible for the death of Khan. Come on, talk about lying.REGAN: Alan, you said she's been forthcoming. I don't think she's been very forthcoming. I mean, it takes 250 days, nearly 250 days to get a press conference out of her?  COLMES: You know what, you had a Republican head of the FBI say that there was not enough information to indict, that he would not bring a case -- he would not bring a case in a situation like this. I mean, how much more do you want to go on about this?REGAN: Katrina Pierson, (inaudible). I'm not going to play the tape again because she said over and over again -- Katrina, get in here.(CROSSTALK)PIERSON: I'm really glad -- I'm really glad that Alan Colmes -- Absolutely. I'm really glad that Mr. Colmes brought up Hillary's testimony because that now is under question considering how there's a possibility she committed perjury when answering those questions. It is going to be big problem for her.COLMES: You've got a lying candidate, Katrina. Your candidate lies about everything.REGAN: Let Katrina finish.PIERSON: Alan, Alan(CROSSTALK)REGAN: I'd like to hear from Katrina. Katrina, go ahead.FIGARO: The decisions that Mr. Trump has made...PIERSON: Alan, no one has died, and that is the problem here. She lied about people who were under her watch who died, and then she stood in front of their caskets and lied to the faces of their families. I think that is far, far more --COLMES: You know, Katrina, it's amazing(CROSSTALK)COLMES: If I could speak.REGAN: We are doing it here tonight. Thank you to the whole team. I appreciate you joining me. Still ahead, Megyn's emotional interview with the wife of a late neurosurgeon who spoke freely about his journey with terminal illness in a powerful new book.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS THE KELLY FILE SHOW HOST: In 2013, Paul Kalanithi was a promising neurosurgeon nearing the final days of residency. Then a terminal cancer diagnosis changed everything. In an instant, the man behind life-saving surgeries was now helpless to cure his own illness.His struggle is documented in the book, ""When Breath Becomes Air,"" a memoir written by Paul but completed by his wife Lucy, who picked up the writing when Paul could no longer do it, and what a message they share. In just a moment, we'll speak with Lucy about her life with Paul. But first we go to Trace Gallagher for more on their incredible story, Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER: Megyn, Paul and Lucy Kalanithi met during their first year of medical school at Yale. They later married and moved to California to begin their residencies, he at Stanford, she at UC San Francisco. In the book, ""When Breath Becomes Air,"" the Kalanithi's acknowledge that before the diagnosis, their marriage was struggling. When Paul realized he was sick, he writes, quoting, ""we sat on the couch, and when I told her, she knew. She leaned her head on my shoulder, and the distance between us vanished.""Despite the diagnosis, they decided to have a baby. Elizabeth Arcadia was born in July 2014. Lucy wrote about the implications, quoting again, ""I fear it might make his death so much more painful if he had to say goodbye to a child."" Paul's response to her, ""well, wouldn't it be great if it did?"" Paul later wrote to his daughter, ""...you filled a dying man's days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more, but rests satisfied.""During his undergrad at Stanford, Paul Kalanithi studied literature and dreamed of being a writer and despite the physical suffering, he continued to write. And Lucy kept her promise to finish the manuscript and shepherd it to publication. Writing in the ""New York Times,"" quote, ""And now as I prepare to watch Paul's work take on a life of its own, I begin to take on a life of my own.I've learned like the timing of bereavement -- perhaps like the initial stages of falling in love -- is utterly unpredictable."" She says she can no longer comfort him but the other vow she made on her wedding day stretch well beyond death, Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you. Dr. Lucy Kalanithi joins me now. She's a clinical assistant professor at Stanford School of Medicine and the wife of the late Paul Kalanithi, neurosurgeon, and author of ""When Breath Becomes Air."" Lucy, thank you so much for being here. It is such a beautiful story and so powerful in so many ways, giving everyone thoughts about life and death and what we're doing here and Paul's search throughout his whole life for the meaning of life and of death. Did he find it?LUCY KALANITHI, LATE NEUROSURGEON'S WIFE: You know, I was talking with a friend of Paul's recently who said something I really loved. He said, ""I think that Paul felt the struggle to find meaning is the meaning."" And I kind of think that's true and I love it.KELLY: Yeah. That jumps off the pages. This is a man who, in addition to going to Yale med school, studied literature at Stanford, studied the history of medicine at Cambridge, and was in a nonstop search to better understand death, only to find time after time in the academic setting, the details were unknowable. It wasn't until his diagnosis that the lights started to go off for him.KALANITHI: Right. You're right. He was really interested his whole life in mortality as sort of an intellectual, philosophical problem. And then he wanted to grapple with it, so he entered medicine to be a doctor. And then at age 36, he himself was diagnosed with terminal cancer as you know. And so suddenly, it was a very personal, emotional challenge for him.KELLY: The two of you growing together, med school, you know, it's so challenging, and he writes in the book about the moment, the diagnosis. It's a less than a 0.01 percent chance that a 36-year-old man is going to wind up with this kind of terminal cancer. And he writes in the beginning of the book, ""I flipped through the CAT scan images, the diagnosis is obvious. The lungs were matted wit innumerable tumors, the spine deformed, a full lobe of the liver obliterated. Cancer, widely disseminated.I was a neurosurgical resident entering my final year of training. Over the last six years, I had examined scores of such scans on the off chance that some procedure might benefit the patient. But this scan was different. It was my own."" And even you, a trained doctor yourself, looked at him and asked, do you think there's any possibility it's something else? And he told you the truth. No.KALANITHIH: Right. I mean, I really remember that moment because we looked at the scan together. Nobody delivered the news slowly. We were both doctors, and so we pulled up the CAT scan and looked right at it, and we could see cancer throughout his organs and his spine. And one of the first things Paul said was -- he said, I want you to re-marry, and it was so beautiful and surprising and an immediate recognition of what we would be facing and the fact that we each wanted to help each other through all of it.KELLY: He writes about how he talked with his doctors many times about -- because this is, you know, he was in the top of the top of the top of the heap. I mean the best, most promising neurosurgical resident and then doctor they had. And so he wanted to continue working, and yet wasn't sure if this is what he should do with his time he had left because he also wanted to write. But you talk about how much he worked in the book, saying he worked tirelessly to secure my future, and I worked tirelessly to secure his present. And even to the point where you finished the book for him.KALANITHI: Initially he went back to work, and then he became too ill to do brain surgery and he started writing, which was his lifelong dream. And he died while he was working on the manuscript for ""When Breath Becomes Air."" And I wrote the epilogue to the book and I don't consider myself a writer, but it felt like an urgent, important thing to describe how Paul died and then to reflect on his life and what's been going on since.KELLY: The way he died is oddly inspirational. I mean, usually we say the way he lived. But the way he chose to die and handle his dying somehow makes you a little less afraid of it and somehow inspired by him. The way you put it when you wrote the epilogue was this, ""for much of his life, Paul wondered about death and whether he could face it with integrity. In the end, the answer was yes. I was his wife and a witness.""KALANITHI: Yeah. It's so lovely to me to hear you describe your experience of reading the book, and you're right. At the end of his life, Paul faced a really difficult choice about whether to prioritize quality of life or quantity of life. And people write to me or tweet at me, and it all feels like a eulogy or a condolence letter or this really personal connection with people over what Paul's decisions and writing meant to them in their lives.KELLY: Well, I have been personally inspired, and I know my team here feels the same. I'm so grateful that you shared his story, that he did as well. What a parting gift for us all, especially little Cady. God bless you. Good luck to you.KALANITHI: Thank you so much. Thank you.KELLY: All the best.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: Pretty amazing story. We're going to be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN: Thanks so much to all of you for watching. Megyn is having fun. She's off on vacation so I'm going to be back here again on Monday night. I will see you there. I'm also going to see you Monday day on Fox Business on ""The Intelligence Report"" where I am every day at 2:00 p.m. eastern. I'll see you there Monday. Have a terrific weekend, everyone. Governor Huckabee is in for Sean Hannity next. Good night.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

4	4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/07/01/what-does-bangladesh-terror-mean-for-fight-against-isis/	What does Bangladesh terror mean for the fight against ISIS	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" July 1, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(COMMERCIAL BREAKS)SEBASTIAN GORKA, MARINE CORPS UNIVERSITY: Look at what has happened in the jihadi world in the last two years, two attacks in Paris, an attack in Brussels, San Bernardino linked to ISIS, Orlando, linked to ISIS, Istanbul apparently linked to ISIS, and now we have Bangladesh. The world is on fire.MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA COVERT OPS OFFICER: The concern has been, it's not -- this is something that just developed now with this attack. The concern has been over the past year, year and a half, that we're seeing a new generation of jihadists rising up.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: We're still getting more details out of Bangladesh, as the death toll now officially stands at two police officers, but many believed to be hostages inside. ISIS claiming responsibility in Dhaka, the hostages held at a restaurant near the U.S. embassy there in Bangladesh. And that is the diplomat's area, and a restaurant frequented by western and other diplomats.Let's bring in our panel and start there: Fox News media analyst and host of Fox's ""MediaBuzz"" Howard Kurtz; Karen Tumulty, national political correspondent for The Washington Post, and Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard.All right, Steve, obviously this is still ongoing, but the fact that ISIS is claiming responsibility and it seems like we're seeing more and more of these attempts, Ramadan coming to an end.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes, certainly. We've seen an increase in attacks in Bangladesh in south Asia more broadly over the past year, year-an-a-half. And this is similar in some respects to an attack that took place in Jakarta at a Starbucks, similar operationally, and it was also an area that's frequented by diplomats, by westerners, what have you.This looks like it would be an operational leap forward. It looks better coordinated. There are talk of nine attackers, so this may be more serious and suggest that ISIS is really building a support system in Bangladesh as it is throughout south Asia. I think the irony is, as you point out, at the end of Ramadan, and just two weeks ago the president of the United States stood before cameras and said these are not holy warriors. They certainly think they're holy warriors.BAIER: Karen, this is a challenge for this administration as it continues to try to deal with how its dealing with ISIS.KAREN TUMULTY, THE WASHINGTON POST: That's right. And Bangladesh is a country that has been viewed as moderate. There has been attacks, but until now they've been done by small groups with machetes. The government has tried to pin the blame so far just on sort of domestic groups, political opposition. This is something on a scale that has not been seen there. And I think it is going to be a very delicate question, both in this country and there in sort of acknowledging that there's something bigger afoot in this country.BAIER: Eye-opening after this and as you heard Sebastian Gorka say in Turkey and Orlando for people here, it's in their mind.HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST: It does feel like the new normal. And the more that ISIS or ISIS recruits can pull off these smaller scale attacks on soft targets like restaurants, the more countries it can hit, the more television coverage it can generate, the more ISIS can wield its weapon of fear. And there is a hunger, I think, and you see this reflected in the campaign for a strategy that takes the fight to ISIS, because we can't defend every soft target, every nightclub, every airport counter in the world. But there is a hunger for the administration to do something, but it needs allies. The U.S. can't do it all on this global scale.BAIER: We'll keep you updated here. If we get any more details we'll bring them to you here on FOX.Let's turn now to the U.S. election and the thing that has dominated really the last couple of days, and that is this meeting on a plane.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: It's important to make it clear that that meeting with President Clinton does not have a bearing on how this matter is going to be reviewed, resolved, and accepted by me, because that is the question that it raises. And the fact that the meeting that I had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work, it's something that I take seriously and deeply and painfully.DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It just happened to be, oh, just a coincidence, you know. He just happened to be at the airport at this time. Think of it, just happened to be at the airport. I think he really opened it up. He opened up a Pandora's Box, and it shows what's going on, and it shows what's happening with our laws and with our government.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: Karen, we reported today that FBI agents, at least some of them, many of them, are very upset with this development and how it looks, and also the fact that Bill Clinton is not only just the former president, he's also potentially a witness or a target in the Clinton Foundation investigation part.TUMULTY: Yes, this is Bill Clinton's greatest misjudgment on a tarmac since LAX had to shut down two runways so he could get a haircut. Yes, and just the fact that, you know, Bill Clinton, who conducted his entire presidency in the independent council era would not understand what, you know, at a minimum the appearances of this meeting would be, it's just astonishing.BAIER: What we didn't hear is that the attorney general was recusing herself, officially, and that, you know, says something, too.HAYES: No, it really says something. And the fact that they couldn't get their stories straight all day, remember, the original report, I think it was broken on ""Good Morning America,"" suggested that she was going to accept the FBI's investigation and move on. Then she spoke and said she would accept the FBI's recommendations. Then she said, I expect to accept the FBI recommendations. And then later she says, finally, there are leaks later this afternoon saying that she remains involved and will be the ultimate decider. So nothing has changed from where we were this morning. She remains involved. And it's just a lot easier if you tell the truth.And I think that, you know, the big problem here is, why was the FBI telling this reporter or telling reporters or people on the tarmac they couldn't take pictures of this? Whether it was a cover-up or not, it sounds like this was something they didn't want to get out. And, you know, this is exactly why people don't trust Washington.BAIER: And this, whatever happens, will have an asterisks now, for some people.KURTZ: Adding to public distrust on the ultimate outcome. Look, I can tell you as an old justice reporter, this is a head-slapping case of bad judgment. It's not just about the optics. Law enforcement officials are not supposed to engage in what are called ex parte contacts with anybody that could be the subject or target or a witness in an investigation. Bill Clinton is a charming guy, but Loretta Lynch should have picked off that plane.And on the question of her role, an update from the top Justice Department spokesman this afternoon to Yahoo! News, the two political appointees, says the spokesman, directly under Loretta Lynch will review the career prosecutor's recommendation, and, though unlikely, could overrule it. So there is still a political layer here.BAIER: But quickly, the politics fallout, as Donald Trump, obviously talking about this again today, does it benefit him in some way, politically?TUMULTY: Well, yes, because it does cast doubt, whether if the FBI does not recommend indictments, whether that's going to be viewed as an exoneration. There's just sort of too much, kind of, going on, putting noise into what is supposed to be a pretty straightforward investigation. The FBI takes breaches of national security very, very seriously. And that is what is at question here with this whole question of a private e-mail account.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
