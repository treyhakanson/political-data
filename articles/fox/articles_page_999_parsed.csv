This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld, it's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""We are covering three breaking news stories; two overseas and one at home. First, Donald Trump named his VP pick today. It is Indiana Governor Mike Pence. They will appear together in New York tomorrow and we will get to that in a little bit. We also have new developments on the horrific new terror attack in France. The third major one in that country within the last two years, 84 people are dead. More than 50 are still fighting for their lives and around 150 others are wounded after a terrorist in a truck plowed through crowds celebrating Bastille Day in Nice. But first, a group within Turkey's military has engaged in what appears to be an attempted coup. Let's get the latest now from ""America's Newsroom"" host Bill Hemmer in Nice, France. Bill, a lot to catch us up on and we're glad that you're here.BILL HEMMER, ""AMERICA NEWSROOM"" CO-HOST: Certainly. Dana, let's start in Turkey and just understand the context of this country and what they've been going through for four years now. Turkey has had a war on the southern border in Syria. It is put tremendous pressure on the people, tremendous pressure on the government. In addition, they've had the challenge from the Kurdistan Workers' Party for some time. And that sliver of the world, Dana, has been so tender and so precarious for so long. It is also been -- it's been a major route for ISIS fighters in and out of Europe. If you go back to November in Paris during the bombings there that we covered, those Belgian terrorists admitted in the open how publicly they would move across the borders between Western Europe, Eastern Europe, into Turkey and back again. In addition, you've got a third factor in Turkey, that's this immigration effect. There are tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees who have created tremendous pressure on the country of Turkey. So what we believe we're watching right now based on the reporting we're getting is that there is a claim about a military coup. Now I want to emphasize some of the leaders in the government are suggesting this was just a small faction within the military. But as we try and flush this out over the coming hours, and perhaps the coming days, we'll get a truer picture of what's happening in there, but tremendous pressure on the government and its people. I think it's very interesting also, if you look at the statement that apparently came from the Turkish military, what they talked about was security within the country. Think about that now as we go through this story from Istanbul.PERINO: And Bill, you flew Nice so that you could report on that. We have obviously -- just fresh and breaking news. Now 84 people are dead, there's a hundred and fifty wounded and 50 are still fighting for their lives. What is the update from this ground?HEMMER: You know, Dana, there's a makeshift memorial that was created behind me here just in the last couple of hours. It reminds me of being in terrorist back in November in Place de la Republique where they --(AUDIO GAP)HEMMER: . that was --(AUDIO GAP)HEMMER: . for this country.(AUDIO GAP)HEMMER: . couple of minutes, you see people coming together and they hug and the tears come rolling down their eyes because for the third time now, in 18 months, this country has been hit by a major terrorist attack. We're learning some details about the driver of that truck age 31, born in Tunisia but lived locally here in East France. But he did have a criminal record. Not extensive, but a criminal record estranged from his wife, accused of domestic violence that went back about four years. He also apparently has got a bar fight here in Nice back in January, has got a road rage incident in the month of March. He was convicted in that incident, Dana. He was sentenced to jail for six months, did not serve, did no time because it was just his first conviction. We're starting to piece together, though, what happened here about 25 hours ago. There are about 1,200 security cameras throughout the city of Nice, France. They believe in the hills outside of town, they can trace him loading weapons and grenades in the back of that 19-ton truck. And then they can follow him throughout the city arriving at a police checkpoint just about a half mile from our location here. Something happened that allowed him to get past that police checkpoint, and he jammed that accelerator, Dana. And the carnage left in its wake is just astounding; 84, 85 dead. That number will change throughout the night. And of the wounded more than 200 wounded, 25 are on life support as we speak.PERINO: All right.HEMMER: More in a moment from Nice, France.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Bill, thank you so much. And we are also joined now by Dr. Sebastian Gorka, who is on the phone with us to bring us up to speed both on Turkey and to give us some perspective also on this latest terrorist attack in Nice. Dr. Gorka, thanks for being with us today. Your thoughts on -- take your story, whichever one you want to start with.DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, ""DEFEATING JIHAD"" AUTHOR: Well, very quickly. Nice is, is very significant not only because of the scale, but because it -- oh, well, it proves that --PERINO: Sorry, doctor. You're on by phone. You're obviously here with us and thank you so much.GORKA: Yes.PERINO: Go ahead.GORKA: OK. All right well, OK. Let's talk about the most important geostrategic event, that's Turkey. The events in France are an atrocity. Our heart goes out to all who are kill -- all who were killed and the victims who are lying in the hospital right now. The geostrategic important of the coup in Turkey cannot, literally cannot be over emphasized. This is the largest military in Europe belonging to NATO. It was a pivotal ally during the cold war. And in the last few years under the reign, and I mean the reign of Erdogan, it has been -- it has become a fundamentalist nation, or nation run by a crypt of Muslim brotherhood, type of elite. And now the military has said, ""Enough is enough. We're taking our country back."" Remember, the legacy of attitude (ph), the founder of the secular Turkish state was that the military was always going to be the guarantor of democracy. They were intimidated under Erdogan; the former chair of the joint chiefs was arrested on a completely false trumped up terrorism charge. He tried to intimidate the political elite. He tried to intimidate the military elite. Now the military has stepped up to the plate and said, ""You've been playing footsy under the table with the Islamists, you've been helping ISIS. We're going to stop it."" This is big news.PERINO: So you have basically Erdogan made a deal with the devil and now .GORKA: Totally.PERINO: . we're seeing results of that.GORKA: Yeah, I mean --PERINO: Eric Bolling has a question for you, Sir.GORKA: Yeah.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Dr. Gorka, let me see if I can bring these two events together and then weigh in on this. So Turkey wanted to become part of the European Union which would entail millions of Turkish and possibly refugees into the European Union, into the homeland on Europe. Meanwhile, we have in Nice, allegedly this crazed idiot yells Allahu Akbar before he mows down 84 and possibly more coming up. Do they -- are we seeing a pattern here? Should we take a lesson from what they've done wrong in Europe?GORKA: Oh, absolutely Eric. So think about what Brexit was about. Brexit wasn't just about sovereignty and faceless bureaucrats in Brussels deciding, you know, what a British sausage could have in it. It was about national security. It was about the idea that you cannot vet people coming from a war zone as refugees into the continent of Europe with some countries like Germany accepting more than a million so-called refugees who then have freedom of movement inside the EU. And Secretary Kerry, although he denied this, somebody should tell him the facts. One of the Brussels bombers got in to Europe on a fake Syrian passport and was awarded refugee status in the EU. This isn't a hypothetical, Eric, this is a reality. ISIS is doing this and they have plans to do it here in America, as well. So the question of Muslim populations, integration, the exploitation of those communities that aren't integrated, this is national security at the highest level.PERINO: Greg Gutfeld.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hey, doctor. You know, when we see events that happen in Nice or in other places, they're always -- there's always the candle lighting and the vigils, and then we move on. Is there any sense at all that we will not be moving on? That we've kind of had enough of the candles and the vigils and now it is actually time for action?GORKA: Yeah, you know who that's up to, Greg? That's up to us. That's up to the French voters. That's up to the German voters, the American voters, because the elite have failed us. I really, you know, if you talk to the operators, if you meet with the French intelligence agents, the law enforcement agents, you meet with the FBI special agents pounding the pavement trying to keep us safe, they get. They know the threat to America. That's not the problem. The problem is the political elite that say, you know, these are not the droids you're looking for, there's no such things as jihad. Religion is irrelevant. You need jobs for these guys and we're going to solve the problem. That's the issue, lack of leadership. And leadership only takes things seriously if they feel as if they're going to lose their job or if they're replaced with people who are true leaders. Look what happened last night with Hillary. I was in the green room here in New York, in D.C., waiting to go on. And we see Hillary Clinton on the ""Bill O'Reilly"" show. I thought I'd stepped through the looking glass into an ultimate universe. Why did that happened? Because she knows, she finally clicked after Nice. November isn't going to be about pocketbooks, it's not going to be about ObamaCare. November for Americans is going to be about national security. Am I going to be safe when I step out of my home every morning? And she's desperate. But you know it, and ""The Five"" know it, this is about national security now.PERINO: Kimberly Guilfoyle.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hi, Dr. Gorka. Thanks for being with us. So with national security and our interests here in America at the foremost important right now, especially given just the complex events that are going on in Turkey, what we saw in Nice and the number of other attacks that have happened throughout the world. What would be your advice to the White House, to this administration, that should be done immediately so we don't lose time between now and the next election in November?GORKA: Well, look. In my book ""Defeating Jihad,"" there are three very simple things; get politics out of the threat assessment. No more political correctness. No more censorship. Be honest. Who is the enemy, what do they call themselves, what is their plan and recognize they're evil. They're not victims. They're evil. Secondly, we have to empower our Muslim allies, and this includes Turkey if Turkey stabilizes. We cannot be the face of this war. White Christians, black-skinned Christians or Atheists can't be the face of this war. It has to be the local Sunnis who are paying the biggest price right now that includes the Egyptians, the Jordanians. Those governments who have been (inaudible) systematically for seven years by Obama, they have to be encouraged to come together. We have to convince them, we want them to win and we have to help them to crush ISIS. And lastly, you know, I'm a kid of the cold war, and I grew up understanding that the totalitarian are always just a generation away. These guys are totalitarians. The jihadists are just as much a totalitarians as the communists or the fascists. They just have this religious overlay. We can only win if we delegitimatize their message. We have to have a giant counterpropaganda campaign like Ronald Reagan had in the 1980s. Those three things together -- sorry it's not five -- those three things together and we could defeat the jihadist in a matter of a year and a half.PERINO: That's really excellent perspective. We're going to keep going with you.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Juan Williams.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Oh, hi, Sebastian. I just had a quick question about, what do we know about this 31-year-old who perpetrated this horrific act in Nice? From what I am reading, he is a Tunisian national, and there has been no direct connection made between his actions and the terrorists, but we do know that the terrorists have celebrated what he has done in terms of their social media. So I'm just curious if we are -- where are we in establishing a direct link to the terrorists?GORKA: Right. So what the facts are, we know he's a French Tunisian which is very significant, incredibly significant. Because Tunisia, of all the nations of the region has supplied the highest number of jihadist to ISIS, which is really shocking because the conventional wisdom is that Tunisians are liberal, no, it's not, and they provided the greatest number of jihadist. He has an S-file in France, which means he's had running's with the law; petty crime, violent crime. I don't think he served time. He was convicted, but I'm not sure he served time. But if he did, that's another potential avenue because we've seen lot of jihadist be recruited in prison in Europe and also here in America. And the last thing is the really disappointing thing where people still in, you know, we've got schools of people in intensive care still. We've got Americans dead, including a child. And already, there are people trying to generate the narrative that, oh, he wasn't a real Muslim. He drank pork and he was a bad guy. So his cousin, of course, is trying to generate the kind of narrative we expect of the Obama White House here. So the news is interesting, it's not conclusive with regards to connections to the jihadi conspiracy. But Juan, the point is it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter whether he was, you know, controlled by ISIS or not. If he's shouting Allahu Akbar, he's a jihadi.PERINO: So also, Dr. Gorka, last night on the Megyn Kelly show, on ""the Kelly File,"" Marc Thiessen was talking about -- he actually had the document from the ""Inspire"" magazine .GORKA: Yes.PERINO: . which is the ""Propaganda Magazine"" that said, ""Step by step, if you want to be a jihadist, this is exactly how you should carry out an attack."" So I don't see why we're spending time thinking about whether or not there's a terror connection. It was actually, almost described perfectly in ""Inspire"" magazine.GORKA: Well, absolutely. This is issue two, I think in 2010, the English language, al-Qaeda magazine. And remember, ISIS came out of al-Qaeda. ISIS is the former al-Qaeda in Iraq. And in this magazine, you can download now, you know, the FBI may knock on your door tomorrow, but you can download it. There's a photograph of an F-150 pickup truck. And the article in English says, ""You don't need a gun. You don't need to build a pressure cooker bomb. Just take your truck and mow the infidel down like you're mowing grass."" This attack should not have surprised anybody. And the fact that we have reports that the driver, the jihadi, was sitting on the boulevard for three to six hours, waiting to do the attack, and he got away with it. That's very bad. That's very bad.PERINO: Eric have question.BOLLING: Dr. Gorka, a comment and you can tell me if I'm wrong, if I'm crazy, but I have a hunch you're going to agree with me. So President Obama came out this morning, this afternoon, about 3 o`clock or so, and he spent about 10 minutes talking about this Nice attack. And he warned of a kneejerk reaction, an Islamophobic reaction by the world and the American people. And then he said, ""And I recommend diplomacy."" And I'm -- my mind almost exploded at that moment. I'm thinking, here's a terrorist, here's someone who may not think is a terrorist, but if he yells Allahu Akbar, and as Dana points out or Thiessen points out, they use exactly the same tactics in at terrorist magazine, I would called him a terrorist. That would by definition be a terrorist for me.GUILFOYLE: Yeah -- just kidding.BOLLING: But for the president to say we need to use diplomacy, who are we being diplomatic with, terrorists now? Is that what he's recommending?GORKA: Do I really have to comment? It's --(LAUGHTER)GORKA: It's unconscionable. I mean, the idea that after Fort Hood, the chief of staff of the army said, he's priority concern is that we don't threaten multiculturalism in the armed forces. After Orlando, we have the attorney general say, ""We will win with our best weapon which is love."" Can you tell that please, to the people who were burned alive in the ovens of Auschwitz? When you're facing totalitarians whether its fascists, whether it's a KKK, communist, Hitler or whether it's the jihadist, there's nothing to negotiate about. You can't love them. You can't win with diplomacy. You crush them into the ground. I really -- every time we have a horrific event, I say, please, God, let this be the moment when the administration says, OK, we messed up. We're going to take it seriously now. We're going crush these individuals.WILLIAMS: All right, so Sebastian, let me give you the other side from the Dr. Bolling perspective, which is that here in the United States, we have been so blessed in terms of not suffering the degree of horror that we've seen and repeated now .PERINO: That's not blessing.WILLIAMS: . for the last few months --PERINO: That's not a blessing.WILLIAMS: Well I think --PERINO: That's effort and work.WILLIAMS: So here's my point to you. If, in fact, we have been able to hold, to hold the Muslim community in this country as a part of an integrated hold, with they're not concentrated in ghettos, not segregated and the like as we often see in many of the European countries. And for that reason, they have been much more taken into the mainstream. Isn't that, as well as keeping our Arab-Muslim allies working with us to our advantage?GORKA: Yeah. Let me share with you the statistics of the facts of the case. We have killed or arrested 107 ISIS suspects in America since the caliphate was declared two years ago. Not seven. Not 77, a hundred and seven. Less than 20 percent were people that we discovered because their community told them about us. We found them through the internet or by accident. That is a very bad number, a very pad proportion.PERINO: All right. Dr. Gorka, you're gonna -- I think you're going to stick around.GUILFOYLE: OK.PERINO: We have just to take a quick break and we will be back with more on these developments. Thanks.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: And now to another breaking story today, Trump's announcement of Mike Pence as his running mate. He made the announcement on Twitter this morning, quote, ""I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my vice presidential running mate."" News conference tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. But reporters caught up with the Indiana governor in New York City earlier.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, INDIANA GOVERNOR: Very excited, humble and very grateful. We love Indiana. We love our country. My family and I couldn't be more honored .(CROSSTALK)PENCE: . to have the opportunity to run with and serve with the next president of the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. And Sean Hannity has an exclusive interview with Pence tonight at 10:00 p.m. eastern, so you definitely don't want to miss that. So let's go now to Campaign Carl, he is live at Trump Tower with all the very latest. Carl, very nice to see you.CARL CAMERON, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Likewise, Kimberly. The Trump campaign and Mr. Pence had a meeting today. It lasted about hour and a half. The governor of Indiana made it very clear with his filing in Indianapolis that he's not going to be running for governor, obviously, today. The stage craft of this pretty much revealed the realities of who this election was going to be, couple of days ago. And Mr. Trump wasn't all that thrilled with the way it appeared to be leaking so rapidly yesterday. There was considerable consternation about it. He was upset about and irritated about it. He thought it could have been a little bit of a better starting point, but for their professional relationship now is the ticket. But such as it is, tomorrow at 11:00, they will have a news conference, take questions and we will see Donald Trump and Mike pence as a twosome, answering questions from the press and explaining why their ticket they believe will be better than Hillary and whoever she picks.GUILFOYLE: All right. Thank you. So we've got a bunch of questions. Eric, what do you think about the pick in terms of how it's playing out in the press today?BOLLING: Well, I think everyone is kind of digesting what Mike Pence is about. I was very encouraged to see Paul Ryan with the positive tweet about Mike Pence. I was encouraged to see Marco Rubio, very early in the morning with a positive tweet about Mike Pence. I think what they'll going to go and Trump --if I'm reading this selection right, is that they'll going to go for the economy and jobs. Pence have been very, very sure. He instituted the biggest tax cut in the state of Indiana's history, created a lot of jobs. He was also a -- an earmarked reformer when he was a congressman, as well.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, it's true.BOLLING: And I think it's really smart for them to take that because we know all these exit polls, people say the most important things, yeah national security, yes. But economy and jobs number one. So it sounds like a good pick.GUILFOYLE: OK Dana, what do you think? I know you like it for a bumper sticker.PERINO: Oh, Trump-Pence.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: So as well, five letters, perfect. But I think in our A-block, we were talking to Dr. Gorka who -- in his opinion, then this election comes down to national security. I think that campaigns can do both, right? So that it's possible that you can be, as Donald Trump said earlier this week, ""I'm the law and order candidate,"" which I think extends to national security, not just domestic problems we might have here at home, as well as do the jobs things. I mean he's got -- Pence has very good relationships with a lot of people in the establishment, right? So it's like Ryan, Rubio, those guys all put up positive statements. That's not a bad thing for the Trump campaign at all. I do think that Pence --GUILFOYLE: Also the Tea Party people?PERINO: Oh, definitely.GUILFOYLE: The party caucus.PERINO: The relationships there. So I actually think that this will be -- this is a good, safe pick for him. I do feel for Newt Gingrich and Chris Christie, who I think put up a good fight for it. And maybe they'll end up doing something else. Of course, already Chris Christie has a very important job of running the transition; huge responsibility.GUILFOYLE: Huge responsibility. Yeah. It couldn't be more important. Greg?GUTFELD: Well, I'm not sure that this is the choice that Trump wanted. You know, I think Trump wanted to do something daring, and I think this was maybe -- hoisted upon him to polish his edges, because remember, Trump is the switchblade and Pence is kind of like a spork. He's like, he pleases everybody; both a knife and a fork.PERINO: And that was spork, actually.GUTFELD: Everybody loves a spork. And I mean, and the fact is, you know, Trump -- I mean Trump is --GUILFOYLE: We have on the bus.GUTFELD: It goes back to what Gorka says about -- it's all about national security. And I think Trump -- last night probably thought, Flynn, after looking at Nice going like, this is it, this is it, but he couldn't .GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: . do it.GUILFOYLE: But all those people can be in important positions. You have Christie as AG. You can have Flynn at NSA or something of that level and you know --GUTFELD: I'm thinking -- I think he has a better chance of controlling Pence than Newt.GUILFOYLE: Yes. All right, Juanito.WILLIAMS: Well, I think this is all about the Midwest. Because, I think that what we see here is, if you pick Mike Pence who is strong in the Midwest, as opposed to Newt Gingrich who has a national profile, and guess what, Mike Pence is a guy who's tight with social conservatives.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: Specifically on the abortion issue where Trump has been kind of, people aren't sure what he thinks. They're not sure if he even goes to church, and all that. Mike Pence backs him up, gives him a base, but it's the reaching out to white men in the Midwest on the trade issue that really, I think helps Donald Trump here. If his strategy has any chance, he's got to go through western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan; that's where Mike Pence is a known factor. And of course, as we heard around the table, he's good with the GOP establishment.GUILFOYLE: It sounds like an endorsement from Juan Williams, a very learned man. All right, next. We return to the terror attack in France, we'll be back in a moment. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: After each terror attack, the western instinct is to always stress restraint. Be careful. Don't act rash. And as for retaliating, we're often told, ""Hey, we're better than that."" So how's that working out? For once, let's be worse.For every time I hear that our leaders have been briefed, you know it's about what not to say, not about what we should do, which is why we move slower than a James Taylor song.This inaction normalizes terror. It means we're stuck with Islamism forever. Our shrug is their drug.Some headlines said that a truck, a truck attacked the event. No. There was someone driving that truck, and what was driving that someone was Islamism. If only we treated terror like something the media finds truly hateful, like smoking or drunk driving. Would our leaders take Islamism seriously if they killed for fossil fuels?Instead, our leader hide the facts. Apparently -- this is amazing -- the French government hid news of gruesome torture of the Bataclan victims. If I gave you the details, you'd pass out. But why hide deeds that should shock the world? We don't do that with other brutality.Every time you hide the truth, evil wins.So this isn't about the easy availability of trucks. It's about our failure to fight evil. Ambivalence, masked by online sorrow, now replaces real action. Expressing solidarity on Twitter feels good, but the war will be won on the battlefield, not online.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: It's time for solidarity. Get away from me, fly.PERINO: It's not a fly.GUTFELD: Wow. What was that?GUILFOYLE: That was a wasp.GUTFELD: That was a wasp? All right. Holy -- that had to be a metaphor. Maybe I should go to church.BOLLING: Yes. Yes, that was God telling me to wise up.PERINO: Maybe.GUILFOYLE: Never a dull moment. What can I say?GUTFELD: That's a first. All right.We're also following the attempted coup taking place right now in Turkey. Hemmer, you're watching the news feed. What have you got?BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Greg, just trying to piece this together now, based on the reports, the headlines we're getting out of Turkey. Impossible to verify, but this is what we're hearing.The airport's closed. Heavy gunfire reported in the capital of Ankara. Military planes flying over the Bosporus Strait. That's near Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey. Tanks reported in some city streets. And again, this is just we're picking up right now on the feed out of Turkey.State TV did read a statement on behalf of the military, talking about this coup. They cited two things. No. 1, rising autocratic rule within the Turkish government. And No. 2, increased terrorism.I think that second point is very important. That goes to national security. That goes to a country that's been dealing with a Syrian war on the southern border for four years, the rising threat of ISIS, the immigration strains that have been placed on Turkey, whereas the E.U. has sort of, going back to last March, told Turkey what to do about more immigrants and refugee. In other words, keep them. That they were coming. And you had to accept them.I think you find that now in this military coup in Turkey. You find it here in France going back in the past year. The rising parties on the right, talk about nationalism. They talk about security here in France. It is also true in Italy. I think you mentioned this about 20 minutes ago. Brexit was a part of that, as well.So that's what you see right now here in Europe and stretching into further east in Turkey.One more point: John Kerry was with reporters in Moscow a bit earlier. He said the following: he hopes for stability, peace, and continuity at Turkey. We'll see whether or not we get that real soon.Back to you in New York.GUTFELD: Thanks, Bill.So Dana, we heard from Mr. Kerry. That's always encouraging.PERINO: The State Department, copy, paste.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ""We hope for stability."" That's always available.But I understand that the State Department, they have languages they have to use. There's international norms. I get all that.I do think that, in addition to all the things Bill Hemmer said, there is mounting pressure in the United States for President Obama to do more.Remember, you had three secretaries of defense -- Hagel, Panetta, and Gates -- all resign over the fact that they had a different perspective. And this was one of them, that they wanted to fight harder.Now today we find out that not only is President Obama doing this, I think troubling partnership with Putin in Russia to fight ISIS, you saw Assad, the president there saying they -- they're not serious about it.But I think pressure is mounting for President Obama to do more.Found out today also that the 82rd Airborne is going to deploy. There will be boots on the ground in December of this year, which is different than what President Obama promised. And that's OK. And if they are willing to change the policies, I think we should applaud them and support them so our military can do what we need them to do.Charles Krauthammer reminded us last night on ""O'Reilly,"" we can fight them there or we'll fight them here. And I'd rather fight them there.GUTFELD: Yes, better late than never, right Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Well, I mean, I guess. I mean, you know, yes, it's important that they're finally waking up, but at our country's national security expense.So there's much to be done. There's much that should have been done. And it's really a matter of leadership and making the right decisions and not being, you know, tied up in this semantic molasses where they can't even say ""radical Islamist terrorism.""So let's get going; let's, like, start it today.GUTFELD: Eric, this is bad news for ISIS?BOLLING: I'm trying to figure this out. In -- we pointed out that Erdogan is -- he's out of the country.PERINO: I think he was on vacation.BOLLING: So, well, the original thought is, well, he went away, so that -- that was the opportunity for this military faction to perpetrate a coup.Or was it that he was warned or told, tipped off to leave, because this was going down. I think the CIA needs to really dig deep and find out what's going on. Remember, he's the guy who oversaw all these ISIS oil transports going through the border. He didn't put a stop to it. He could have put a stop to it.This is going to unravel into something really...GUILFOYLE: And Putin is loving this right now, too. So that's been a very complicated and problematic...GUTFELD: Putin's going to be our new best friend.PERINO: It might not be good for Putin in Turkey, the situation.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: I know, it may not be, because it could go the other way.So you know what strikes me is that listening last night to O'Reilly and then seeing Trump and Hillary Clinton, it was really something.And here you have Trump saying, ""You know what? We just need to be tougher. We need a harder strategy. We need to be tougher on our borders.""And then Clinton comes along and says, ""We need a surge in terms of intelligence."" And what this -- I was like, what is that? Well, he's saying that we need to have more intelligence on the ground, more cooperation with our western allies in terms of this intelligence search. I had not heard this before.GUTFELD: Well, you know why? Would you share your intelligence with Hillary?WILLIAMS: You got me.GUTFELD: Unsecured server.Lieutenant General Flynn will join us when we return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Breaking news on three fronts: Trump, Turkey, and the terror in France.Joining us now is a man who can talk about all three of those and more. Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, author of the book ""Field of Fight.""Thank you for joining us, General Flynn.So we've been talking about what President Obama said earlier regarding Nice, the terror. Last night, Juan brought up that Hillary Clinton also said something like we should use more diplomacy.Sir, talk to us: what do we need to be doing to fight this war on terror?LT. GEN. MICHAEL FLYNN, AUTHOR, ""FIELD OF FIGHT"" (via phone): First of all, thanks for having me, Eric. And I really -- I do love the show that you guys have.So to fight this war, one of the primary things that we must do is we have to discredit this ideology and we have to get the Muslim world, the Arab leaders of the Muslim world, to stand up and be counted.We have got to ask, you know, demand from them, not ask, but demand from them to actually, you know, say what is happening inside of their own system, and start to discredit this -- this radical cancerous form inside of the world of Islam. We cannot continue to have this sort of activity on the international stage.So -- so there has to be some accountability, and it has to come from the leaders of the -- in the Middle East, Africa, and the central Asian republic state. I mean, this is a big deal. We cannot have this kind of terrorism around the world like this.BOLLING: General, we've got a bunch of questions for you. Bring it around the table, K.G.GUILFOYLE: General, it's Kimberly Guilfoyle. So I've long been an admirer of your background in intelligence and national security.Given your background specifically in the intelligence realm, it seems to me that there's much more that we should be doing now to be able to gather information in real time, to be able to thwart these attacks and hunt the people down that want to do us harm.FLYNN: Yes, I mean, first of all, the president came out and said, ""Well, we're going to share more information. We're going give them all these resources."" You mean we haven't been doing that?GUILFOYLE: Right.FLYNN: I mean, come on. You know, I mean, we have to figure out new ways to operate in this world that is -- that is moving at a different speed. It's moving at the speed of light. It's very complex. We have a broader array of what I would describe as the hybrid types of threat. You know, Islamic radicalism is one of them. And it is -- this is a major threat at our door right now. We are going to see these types of attacks continue.So it's beyond just intelligence sharing. This is -- this is, you know, having the willingness and the determination to develop an international strategy that goes out to these guys.And the No. 1 thing that we have to do is we have to discredit this doctrine, this radical Islamic doctrine that exists, but we are going to have to make some new demands, new demands on what I call is a sort of a new 21st Century alliance. And that's where the Arab world comes in. These -- these individuals that run the countries, the kings, the prime ministers, and the presidents, they have to be -- have to stand up and be counted, Kimberly.BOLLING: All right. I have so many questions, but I'm going to just pick one.The choice that the fiend made in Nice was a patriotic event. And I wonder if that, in a way, speaks to the -- the problems with assimilation in the sense that he knew no true believers would get hurt if he went to that event.FLYNN: Yes. You know, I'll tell you what. That's a -- that's a real hard one. Respectively (ph) not.But I will tell you that it -- the kind of event that they were -- that they were having, which is their version of their Independence Day in France, this is the kind of stuff that this culture, that this radical form of this, you know, Islam, they don't like this kind of stuff.I mean, there's three things that they want to do. They want to make you their slave. They want to turn you to their way of life. And if you don't -- you're not able to perform as a slave or they can't turn you to their way of life, you're going to die. And so this is a really sick -- a sick system. And -- and it has to be -- we have to fix this, and it's going to come with some fighting, but it's also going to come with some serious soul searching on the part of these countries where this stuff exists.BOLLING: All right. General, we've got two more questions. We don't have a lot of time. So Dana is next.PERINO: General, I know that you write about this in your new book. And in terms of President Obama, in terms of the pressure that he might be under right now, who is he hearing from? I know he wasn't hearing from you. But if the 82nd Airborne is going to deploy in December, is there going to be a show of force here? Is there something new that's happening? And will rules of engagement change if pressure is brought to bear from the military on the White House?FLYNN: Yes. I hope he's listening to General Joe Dunford. I'm a big fan of Joe Dunford as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.And I will tell you that, you know, you guys are also watching the unfolding of this military coup, potentially, in Turkey. This is not a small issue.I just literally five minutes ago got a note from a Turkish friend in Turkey, and they are highly, highly concerned. I mean, so -- and I know I don't have time to talk about that. But there's so much complexity, and I'm afraid that the president doesn't have the really big strategic thinkers that we need right now. And we really desperately need them. And he doesn't have them. I personally don't think that he's getting the kind of advice that he needs, that is -- that this is now a time for tough diplomacy. This is a time for big demands that the United States has to put on.BOLLING: General Flynn, we're going to have to leave it there. We really appreciate your time tonight, sir.FLYNN: Yes. Thanks a lot for having me on, guys. You have a great show.GUILFOYLE: Thank you.BOLLING: Thank you very much. Very much. Be safe.GUTFELD: Thank you.BOLLING: All right, thank you. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: The crush of news has been so overwhelming, and today no exception. We have an ongoing coup in Turkey. We're still catching up with what took place in France, and of course, Donald Trump has selected Mike Pence, governor of Indiana as his running mate.The one story that we all know about here, politics and Governor Pence. Let me go to Greg.And Greg, Mike Pence describes himself as Rush Limbaugh on decaf. Is that good?GUTFELD: I guess so. I do think that it has a lot to do with -- I think that Donald Trump is a secular -- more of a secular candidate, and I think that he's -- this is a choice to kind of, like, fill that religiosity, that part of him. It's kind of like he's his Father Mulcahy.GUTFELD: Dana, want to -- so where they differ and a lot of the news media now suddenly focusing heavily on Pence, in a way most people don't know who he is, say he disagrees on Trump on the Indiana judge. Remember that Trump said that he's Mexican, can't be fair.Second, he disagrees with Trump on the ban on Muslim immigrants.Third, he endorsed Ted Cruz during the primaries, and fourth, he's for free trade.PERINO: Right. So not unusual that there would be some differences between people, one, but also between a vice-presidential candidate and a president.And Trump and Pence must have figured out a way to at least have a rapport enough that they could come to an understanding. And Pence will probably have to eat some words, and Trump will have to probably swallow some that he would like to say as this new marriage gets introduced to America.WILLIAMS: And Eric, overnight, there were reports that Trump might have changed his mind.BOLLING: No. I didn't hear about that. But OK, very quickly, last night we heard Hillary Clinton using the same words that President Obama used this morning. We need more diplomacy. I would say that she wanted to be the next third term Obama. She's going to do it.WILLIAMS: All right. We're going to take a break right here. Stay wuss. ""The Five"" will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Welcome back to ""The Five."" A busy news day. Kimberly Guilfoyle, your thoughts?GUILFOYLE: Indeed, just when you just see all the confluence of events, what's happening in Turkey with an overthrow underway, the terror attacks that have just been happening over the course of the past month, it just gives you real pause to consider national security should be at the foremost importance for our country at this time, and leadership in that direction is much needed.PERINO: We have a minute left before we have to go. I just saw right before we left that Erdogan, the president of Turkey, who is out of the country, is seeking asylum in Germany, which is pretty interesting.GUTFELD: Amazing.PERINO: Because do you remember, it was just a few weeks ago that Germany passed a law saying it was illegal to insult President Erdogan.GUTFELD: What could happen next, an asteroid? This has been -- this is the worst year, I think, in my memory in terms of horrifying news and just instability.PERINO: And then now we have the RNC convention to go to. Eric, are you looking forward to it?BOLLING: That's going to be great. We have a lot to talk about. We won't have a shortage of things to talk about.PERINO: That's right. Well, as you know, it's been a busy day for news, a very important time not only for our country but for the world. And that is why this election is so important.In a few moments, we are heading to the Republican convention on our bus tour we've been telling you about. And we hope to talk to you along the way. You can follow us on Facebook right now to watch as we embark on this road trip. Facebook.com/TheFiveFNC.Thank you for joining us tonight.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Breaking tonight, new details coming in the classroom of an Oregon Community College when a deranged gunman opened fire, reportedly targeting Christians.  Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. You were looking live at the White House tonight where President Obama ordered flags flown at half-staff.  In Roseburg, Oregon, the investigation is underway into that 26-year-old gunman.  We will not name or show you the face of this shooter, as is the policy of this program.  But we are learning more about who he was.  An army basic training dropout who expressed disdain for religion specifically targeted Christians and showed a fascination with the country's worst mass murderers.  We are hearing exactly what happened when the gunman burst through the classroom door.  A young woman severely wounded and playing dead is recovering in a hospital room tonight and sent us this picture.  Her father joins us with her story and how she says the gunman spared the life of one man so he could deliver the message.  Plus, stories of heroism.  Like that of Chris Mintz, a 30-year-old army vet and father who risked his life to save others.  And survivors are painting a searing image of what it was like to see a madman taking innocent lives.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Shaking his head and then he was pointing like the gun, like he was doing this, and he was like pointing the gun.  He didn't really know how to control his emotions.  I feel like he was screaming and I had seen him walking back and forth in the classroom.  And he was shooting the ground and I think he was shooting people.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  We begin tonight with Dan Springer who is live in Roseburg, Oregon.  Dan.DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And Megyn, two big developments late this afternoon.  First, we've been asking the question why Umpqua Community College.  Well, today, the sheriff confirmed that the shooter was indeed enrolled at the college.  And in fact he was a student in the class where the shooting began yesterday.  Also, the sheriff now announced that the names of the nine victims who were killed in the shooting.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The victims are Lucero Alcaraz of Roseburg, 19-years-old.  Quinn Glen Cooper of Roseburg, 18 years-old.  (END VIDEO CLIP)SPRINGER:  The sheriff continues, 59-year-old Kim Dietz, 18-year-old Lucas Eibel, 33-year-old Jason Johnson, 67-year-old Lawrence Levine who was the only teacher killed.  Forty four-year-old Sarena Moore, 20-year-old Treven Anspach, and 18-year-old Rebecca Carnes.  Some of the families have been began to release pictures.  There will be more to come and many more stories of the lives cut short.  We learned more about the gunman who witnesses said asked his victims to state their religion.  If it was Christian he shot them in the head.  Anywhere else, he shot them in the leg.  His internet blog post and a note left at the scene were field with hate.  He has been around guns most of his life and has had access to many guns.  Many guns yesterday.  There were six at the scene and seven more at his apartment.  All were legal.  There were acts of heroism.  Chris Mintz tried to block the shooter from coming into the classroom.  He was shot seven times but survived.  And how about the first responders who were charging toward the gunman and the mother who was treating victims at the local hospital not knowing of her daughter a freshmen at UCC would be next to the door on a stretcher.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Unknowing, not knowing if your daughter is going to be brought in.  That's what scared me the most.  I didn't know.  And it was probably an hour before I got to talk to her on the phone to know that I actually knew she was okay.  (END VIDEO CLIP)SPRINGER:  Classes here at the college will be canceled all of next week.  But the college will be opened to students who need counseling on Monday -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Dan Springer, thank you.  Well, as we mentioned just moments go, we are hearing the firsthand account of one young woman in the classroom when the shooting started.  Ana Boylan lay on the ground wounded and played dead praying that this gunman would not see the cross she has tattooed on her neck.  Tonight, she is recovering in a hospital room after undergoing surgery, to have a bullet removed that was lodged near her spine.  And we are joined by her father, Stacy Boylan.  Stacy, thank you so much for being here with us tonight.  How did you first learn about the fact that there was a shooting incident at the college yesterday?STACY BOYLAN, FATHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM:  I received a phone call from my brother while I was at work.  And it was shocking.  And it was completely unreal.  My wife and I got in the car and found out where she was being life lighted and we headed down here as soon as possible.  KELLY:  How did you first learn that she was one of the ones who had been shot?BOYLAN:  So she had gotten a hold of my son who is also a student there.  Who is about 600 yards away in another building and when he received a phone call from her, she screamed that I'd been shot.  And that there was so much fear and panic in her voice, and she just said I love you and he told her how much he loved her over and over and over again.  As soon as that call was over, he just tried to get a hold of anyone and everyone he could to get the news out that this had happened.  So I knew right away that she had been shot.  KELLY:  When were you first able to speak with her yourself?  BOYLAN:  Not until the hospital.  When I got to the hospital, they were prepping her for surgery.  And when I got there, she reached my hand, and I just held her and she said, ""Dad, I didn't know what else to do.  I was on the ground and I was praying and I kept hearing your voice and I kept saying don't move.  Just stay down.  Don't say a word.  Don't move.""  And there was so much pain, and she doesn't even to this moment know why he went passed her.  KELLY:  He came into the classroom, he shot the professor first, I understand.  And then what happened?  Does Stacy remember -- I mean, does Ana remember when she was shot?BOYLAN:  She was shot from the initial, is what she understands.  She went to go underneath the desk.  He came in with the guns shooting.  And she went to go down underneath the desk and that's when I believe she was hit with the bullet in the back and then she slid down to the ground.  She heard more gunfire.  There was another gun shot and then she heard him say the gunman say, ""I'd been wanting to do that for a long time.""  And then she said that his laugh was just not human.  And she just laid still.  There were more gunshots and then he stopped shooting.  He told everyone to come to the middle of the room.  And then he started asking people to stand up.  And they would stand up and he started asking what their religion was.  And some brave people who were faithful said that I'm a Christian.  And he said good, then you'll meet God in just about a second.  And he would shoot them in the head.  And then others who didn't answer specifically or mumbled or too afraid to speak, he would wound and they would drop to the floor and he just continued to do this.  KELLY:  And there was a moment when he spoke to another young woman in the classroom about Ana.  Tell us about that.  BOYLAN:  Yes.  So my daughter was in the same class with her friend.  And at one point, he had said, the girl, the blonde haired girl with the black jacket stand up.  And Ana knew that was her.  And she didn't move.  And he reiterated that again and she didn't move, and then he looked over to the girl next to her which was her friend and said, is she dead or alive?  And her friend said, I don't know.  And he didn't continue to shoot my daughter.  And he didn't continue to shoot my daughter and she's her today because of those moments.  KELLY:  You have a cross tattooed on yourself.  She has one.  And your son has as well.  She was worried he would see it, right?BOYLAN:  That's correct.  Yes.  She knew.  Because he was killing anyone who said they were Christian outright.  And if he had seen that cross on her neck and it's visible if her hair would have been out of the way, that that would have given her a way she would probably be dead.  KELLY:  What was the piece of advice you give her in the hospital room about what she should not take way from this?  What she should not do in the wake of this?  BOYLAN:  I told her that this kind of terror and fear, to not let it get inside of her.  That if she allows this to change her life for the worse, that he will win because of that.  And so, she continues to be strong.  There has been an outpouring of support.  An incredible outpouring of support from the local people and friends and family and just, even people I didn't even know coming out of the woodworks and coming around from this activity.  KELLY:  Is she going to be okay, Stacy?BOYLAN:  She has recovered well from the surgery.  Amazingly.  It could have gone better.  KELLY:  Thank God.BOYLAN:  And they were able to extract the bullet without further injury.  And I mean, my daughter is double tough and she is stubborn and she's not going to let this go down.  And I just want to thank everybody who has been supportive, given her love by the grace of God, I'm able to have this conversation with you and tell you that, you know, my daughter lives.  And, yet, I feel horrible and so bad for the families that lost loved ones.  KELLY:  Thank you so much for telling us your story.  All our best wishes to her and to your family as you go through this terrible time.  Thank you for being here, Stacy.  BOYLAN:  Thank you, Megyn.  KELLY:  Unbelievable.  Well, for the second time and as many days, President Obama demanded new laws in the wake of this shooting and went from attacking the NRA to attacking Republicans.  Sheriff David Clarke and Jeremy Bird, a former staffer for the Obama campaign to take up this debate right after the break.  Plus later, as Russia sends new waves of airstrikes across Syria and America is accused of tethering and weakness.  We will speak with General Michael Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and get his thoughts on President Obama's strategy here.  And then ""The New York Times"" publishes a profile of Donald Trump's wife that is anything but flattering.  They've already had to make five corrections to it.  Chris Stirewalt and Howie Kurtz are here on what the paper said.  What it sent out on Twitter.  And why the fallout may just be starting.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Ivanka will be part of the campaign, so will Melania very much so after September.  So, it's start kicking in really big league.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The people who are troubled by this have to be as intense and as organized, and as adamant about this as folks on the other side who are absolutist and think that any gun safety measures are somehow an assault on freedom or communistic or a plot by me to take over and stay in power forever or something.  I mean, there are all kinds of crackpot conspiracy theories that - around there.  Some of which by the way are ratified by elected officials and other party on occasion.  So, we've got to change the politics of this.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  That was President Obama earlier today attacking the GOP on the issue of gun control during remarks at a press conference.  He doubled down on his demand for new laws in the wake of the Oregon shooting.  Despite the fact that the guns we now know were owned legally and that school was a gun-free zone.  Joining me now Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke.  And Jeremy Bird who served as national field director during President Obama's 2012 campaign.  Thank you both for being here.  Jeremy, let me start with you.  JEREMY BIRD, NATIONAL FIELD DIRECTOR, OBAMA 2012 CAMPAIGN:  Thanks for having us, Megyn.KELLY:  What specifically -- what specifically could have been changed?  What gun law could have been changed that would have prevented the shooting?BIRD:  Look, I'm not sure.  It's the honest answer, right?  Each one of these incidents is completely unique.  What we do know though is over the last several years, we continue to see these kinds of violence, these kinds of mass shootings all over our country.  And what the President was saying both last night and today is that inaction is just not an option.  And we know that states that have this laws in place that makes it harder for people that has mental illness, that makes it harder for folks that make people get background checks, it reduces gun violence.  And so, we need to do everything needs answers --   KELLY:  Let me ask you this.  (CROSSTALK)BIRD:  Sure.KELLY:  But we've seen cities like Chicago that have some of those strictest guns laws in the country with the worst crime in the country and the most gun deaths.  So, how do you square that?BIRD:  Yes.  Look.  So, I think we need a national background check law here and guns are going to cross orders and --   KELLY:  But that background check doesn't necessarily detect mental health problems.  BIRD:  Well, it would help.  It would be one step.  See, the problems here is that, there are steps that we can do to decrease this.  We're not going to solve it all.  We need a comprehensive approach to solving this problem.  But we need to do something and stop just thinking that the status quo was okay because it's not.  KELLY:  Okay.  Sheriff Clarke, let me ask you.  President Obama has said, we can't sort through and identify ahead of time who might take actions like this.  The only thing we can do is make sure they can't have an entire arsenal when something snaps in them.  It sounds like he's giving up on the mental health piece of it.  SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY:  Well, first of all, we have ample evidence of the President usurping his authority into the constitution and relation to what he just said.  Look, I get tired of being lectured by somebody who was basically a platoon of armed individuals that cover him and his family and rightfully so but on a daily basis.  While he expects the rest of us here at ground level, average citizens, ordinary citizens, to have to outsource their personal safety to the government.  I'll answer your question what law should be changed.  We should get rid of these gun-free zones, we should allow people, you know, under certain circumstances, you know concealed carry license holders to be able to play a role in their own safety.  I think it's heartless to expect people in these gun free zones to be lined up and slaughtered with no way to defend themselves.  These gun-free zones have become killing fields.  That is the one constant in all of these mass murders including me a military recruiting section --  KELLY:  What do you think, Sheriff?  Let me ask you --  CLARKE: -- the President of the United States doesn't even thrust soldiers, stateside to go on.KELLY:  But what do you think is the solution?  Because this guy, he had some issues.  Some mental issues.  But it doesn't look like he'd been in and out of treatment programs or hospitals or something that would have propped up in a background check.  It has to be really severed for it to come out in the -- so how -- what are your thoughts on how we prevent somebody like who isn't really in the system from mental health issues from getting a gun?CLARKE:  Yes.  There's no fantasy here.  There are no absolutes.  Here's some things that I think might work, though.  First of all, we're not going to ever eliminate the likelihood of something like this happening again.  Okay?  Unfortunately we're in an open society.  But here's what I think should happen, citizens should be allow -- under the constitution, they have their right anyway.  The player role in their own personal safety.  The only thing that stopped that incident yesterday was when a good guy, a police officer with a gun showed up and they were able to neutralize that homicidal maniac.  But as you know, Megyn, it was too late, the carnage had already occurred.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.CLARKE:  So, if somebody, what we can do is mitigate, in other words, this guy comes into the class and starts lining people up, one, two, three people, even unarmed security guards.  I think it's the craziest thing in the world for a student to have to be relying on an unarmed security guard for their safety.  Because if there's one, two or three people wore the firearm in that classroom, a lot of that carnage could have been avoided.  Not all of it maybe --  KELLY:  Okay.CLARKE: -- maybe he gets off a shot or two, and that's about it!  KELLY:  Guys, thank you.  CLARKE:  Thank you, Megyn.BIRD:  Thank you, Megyn.KELLY:  Well, while the gun control debate is in full swing again, did you hear much discussion today about how the shooter specifically targeted Christians?  Up next, we'll take a look at that issue.  Plus, a new poll out today suggests more changes for the Republican field.  We'll show you why Jeb Bush is suddenly the center of attention and what it means for the rest of these candidates?   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEB BUSH, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  If I don't toot my own horn, who's going to toot it?  You know, of course my record is one that I'm proud off.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHERIFF JOHN HANLIN, DOUGLAS COUNTY, OREGON SHERIFF:  I will not name the shooter.  I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act.  We encourage you not to glorify and create sensationalism for him.  He in no way deserves this.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Good for you, Sheriff Hanlin.  The sheriff of Douglas County, Oregon, saying he will not give this shooter the notoriety he seeks.  And we'll talk more about that in a moment.  But we do know that he was specifically targeting Christians.  You heard that father earlier talk about that at the top of the hour.  But you probably haven't heard much about this from the media our elected officials.  Trace Gallagher live with more in our Los Angeles Newsroom.  Trace.  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, ""The New York Times"" said, the shooter inquired about the religion of the victims.  But there was no mentioned in the Times that the inquiry meant a difference between life and death.  ""The Los Angeles Times"" said, the gunman had white supremacist leanings, was anti-government and anti-religion.  But nothing about Christians being singled out and shot.  Some major media outlets even skipped over what maybe the most compelling witness statements of all.  Eighteen year old Courtney Moore saying, the shooter ordered students to get on the ground and then told them to stand up and state their religion.  And the father of witness Ana Boylan moments ago recounting to ""The Kelly File"" that his daughter told him quoting, and some brave people who are faithful said, ""I am a Christian.""  And he said, ""Good, then you'll meet God in just about a second,"" and he would shoot them in the head.  In his comments, President Obama also didn't talk about the religion aspect of the crime.  When he ordered federal flags to fly at half-staff, he said only that it was, quote, ""Out of respect for the victims of gun violence.""  Authorities say, the shooter left a hate-filled note at the scene of the rampage.  That included racist statements, sexual frustration and comments about the world being against him.  His online rants also reveal anger and isolation.  And he wrote about the man who shot and killed several college students in Santa Barbara as well as the shooter who took the lives of a Virginia TV reporter and her photographer saying, quoting again, ""A man who was known by no one is now known by everyone.  His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of any day.""  Seems the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight.  In his final note, the Umpqua College shooter also reportedly wrote that he'd be welcomed in hell and embraced by the devil -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Trace, thank you.  Joining us now with more, Dr. Daniel Bober who was a forensic psychiatrist.  I have been saying this for a long time.  We even news media need to be more responsible, and more careful in our own role in fanning these flames.  While we make these men infamous with the coverage we gave them.  What say you?DR. DANIEL BOBER, FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST:  You something, there was actually data that backs -- there was a study that was done at Arizona State University in 2014 looking at this.  We know that with suicides, for example, and kids, there's a contagion effect where when one child commits suicide, it encourages others to do that, as well.  But we know also with these types of killings that when someone commits a mass murder, there's also a contagion effect or copycat phenomenon.  So when we celebrate it, when we publicize it in some way, we promote it in that 20 to 30 percent of these killings can be attributed to ones that have done it before that are copying them.  KELLY:  You look at his own words.  For the media out there that are reluctant to adopt this policy.  I say, the print media can make a record.  They can put the name out there so it's identifiable.  But for the broadcast media, you remember this -- remember what this killer said. Let's put it on the board.  ""A man who was known by no one is now known by everyone.  His face splashed across every screen.  His name across the lips of every person on the planet all in the course of one day.  It seems the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight.""  What should the media be doing?  Do you say as a professional doctor?  BOBER:  He got exactly what he wanted.  People are in a sense celebrating it, they're promoting it. I think as the media, they need to be more responsible.  Not focus on the graphic content.  And yes, the media has to report the news, but maybe just say his name one time and then refer to him as the shooter or the killer.  KELLY:  Because what does it do to a would be killer to see another killer in a way glorified, his face across all the screens.  His name over and over and over.  BOBER:  I think you're planning the seeds for further violence.  I think you're promoting the next person to do it.  KELLY:  I'm not saying this in solve it, but it can hurt to dial it back, folks, dial it back.  Let me know your thoughts.  BOBER:  I agree.  KELLY:  Doctor, thank you.BOBER:  My pleasure.KELLY:  Let me know your thought on Twitter on Megyn Kelly.  Well, on the middle of the third day of the Russians flying air strikes across Syria, you know, the unprofessional air strikes, there are growing questions about whether the Obama administration ignored warnings about a failed strategy in the run-up to this mess.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER (RET), SENIOR FELLOW, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  You may recall Lieutenant General Mike Flynn.  You had him on the program several times, he's a friend of mine.  Mike went to Congress and laid out what was really going on with ISIS.  And frankly, I don't know if Mike will tell you this or not but that was one of the direct things which led him to being kicked out of DIA.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Well, the man Colonel Shaffer was talking about moments ago here on FOX.  Former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  General Michael Flynn is here next on President Obama's strategy, then and now and his concerns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA:  The last point I just want to make about this, because you know sometimes the conversation here on the beltway differs from the conversation internationally.  Mr. Putin has to go in to Syria, not out of strength but out of weakness, because his client Mr. Assad was crumbling and it was insufficient for him simply to them arms and money.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  That was President Obama earlier today as we watched the third of Russian air strikes in the Middle East. But, as the Commander In Chief accuses his Kremlin counter part of weakness, the headline writers see it differently.  The New York Post suggesting Putin wants to ""Humiliate Obama,"" the Weekly Standard, calling this ""extraordinary show of weakness,"" and as the London-based Economists suggests, while Putin dares, Obama dithers.  Tonight we have Former President George W. Bush's Speechwriter Marc Thiessen with a fact check of President Obama's claims.  But we begin tonight with the Former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, General Michael Flynn.  General Flynn, let me start where Tony Schaeffer left off, suggesting that you and others had been trying to warn this administration about the threat actually posed by ISIS for some time.  He believes your testimony before Congress to that effect as what led to you being forced out as DIA Chief.  Is that true?LT GEN MICHAEL FLYNN, FMR DIRECTOR DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY:  Oh, Megyn, what I would just tell you are -- I believe the intelligence assessment that the President has received over the last few years have actually been pretty accurate.  And I know the intelligence assessments that we provide, that my agency provides.  And I think we're spot on.  Now, I think what we learned this week with Putin placing Russian forces in Syria -- if we ever saw a Russian reset.  We just saw the Russians reset into the Middle East in a big, and I don't agree with what the President said today.  This is not out of weakness.  He's demonstrating a lot of savvy and cunning by doing what he's doing -- for a variety of reasons.  The other thing I would say, Megyn, is that we just learned also this week -- what I would describe as the unmentioned redlines that Putin has had in the Middle East.  And potentially the fall of Assad, potentially the crumbling of the Syrian army in the face of ISIS -- what I would just say is it's kind of like the old thing -- you know when I was a kid, first things first.  I think what we have to do is decide what is the greatest threat that we face there.  It is the radical, Islamic militants.  That's number one.KELLY:  Who Putin is not killing.  He's not killing them.  He's killing the people he trained over there to fight Assad.FLYNN:  I'm not going to apologize for anything that the Russians are doing.  But I don't know.  We'll have to wait and see what the real results are there.  But I would just say we have to decide to do something because the Russians just made a big move and we can't just say, Mr. Putin, go home.  It's not going to happen.  The reality is the dynamics in the Middle East radically changed this week because we failed to lead.  And I think that the President had a great opportunity today to put some clarity behind what it was that we're doing, and I just think he missed a great opportunity.  He really did.  I watched it, hoping that he was going to say something to the effect of what we were going to do, how much we were going to change.KELLY:  What do you think we should do?FLYNN:  I think right now, we're going to have to decide that we have sort of one enemy that we know that we have in common.  And that is the radical Islamists that are -- the Islamic state.  We have to decide that that is the greater threat right now despite all of the problems with a guy like Assad.KELLY:  What should we be telling Putin when he tells us get your jets out of there and get your people out of there?  FLYNN:  I don't think we should listen to Putin at all when it comes to that.  I think we should in no uncertain terms tell him how we operate and what we need to do.  We're sort of passed that point.  Some of those things can still discussed but we're passed it.  We just passed a major -- a big milestone here in the escalation of conflict in the Middle East, and it is going to grow worse before it gets better.  And I don't think that we should be you know asking Mr. Putin for anything.  I thing we ought to be telling the Russians what is that we are going to do in order to accomplish our mission.  And I also think that, at this stage, because the Russians -- I think you're right, the Russians are going to keep Assad in power.  And what we need to do, we need to say at the international community, we're going to deal with the Islamic radical threat first.And internationally, maybe we go after Assad in an international court or something like that.  But this situation just changed radically.  And there is not going to be easy answers, in fact, we are actually moving closer to greater conflict and what that does it limits the number of options that we have.  It increases our risk and, Megyn, sadly it's going to increase the cost to try to solve this problem, because we really did nothing.KELLY:  General Flynn has been jumping up and down about for years. We appreciate you being here tonight, sir, thank you.FLYNN:  Thanks, Megyn.KELLY:  Joining me now, Marc Thiessen, a Fox News Contributor and Former Speech Writer for President George W. Bush.  Mark, let's pick it up with what President Obama said that Putin comes at this from a position of weakness, and that we don't want to get involved in a quagmire which is what Putin's about to do for himself.  MARC THIESSEN, FMR SPEECHWRITER FOR PRES GEORGE W BUSH:  Yeah, Vladimir Putin is the one who weakened -- today, right exactly.  I mean look, Barack Obama is like the kid who is getting bullied at school, and when he comes home and his mom says well, it's just because he's insecure, it's because he's a bully.  Putin is following Lenin's Maxim, probe with bayonets, if you find steel withdraw, if you find mush proceed.  And what he's finding in Barack Obama is absolute mush, and so he's proceeding and that's what he's doing right now in Syria.KELLY:  However, the President says we don't want to go over there and get sucked into another mess, let's let Putin handle it, he's going to create a mess for himself, so be it.  THIESSEN:  And that's what Donald Trump said, as well.  Barack Obama in that press conference today expressed more outrage about Republican congressmen doing nothing about gun violence -- with Vladimir Putin is doing in Syria.  Barack Obama is doing while Vladimir Putin goes and massacres our own allies, U.S.-trained Syrian fighters with impunity.  He did nothing while Barack Obama -- while Assad crossed his red line and massacred his people with chemical weapons.  He did nothing while for five years while ISIS turned that country into a terrorist sanctuary.KELLY:  But now, Marc, he says we don't want to go to war with Russia.THIESSEN:  Of course we don't want to go to war with Russia.  But the problem is he created a vacuum in Syria that Putin has now filled.  If America had been showing leadership and taking the lead on this fight -- we sat on the sidelines for five years and did nothing in Syria.  And then we've got this air campaign now.  We're doing 11 -- 75 percent of them come back without their bombs dropped.  That's not showing weakness?  Vladimir Putin looks at the air campaign against ISIS, the fact that we didn't enforce our red lines.  First he went into Ukraine and now he's going into Syria and he's going to be in Baghdad soon.  I guarantee you the next step is going to be -- they're going to have Russian troops in Baghdad filling our bases that we used to operate in helping to fight ISIS over there because...(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  And the end result of that to us is what?  Why is that a concern?THIESSEN:  The end result of that is Vladimir Putin is in Syria and is going to go into Iraq and be in the Middle East for one reason, he's there at the invitation of the Iranians.  The Iranians are trying to extend their influence throughout the region and they're trying to push us out and push our interest out.  So we have an access between Russia and Iran which Assad is part of that, and they're trying now -- security agreement with Baghdad too to help fight ISIS over there.  They're planting us in the Middle East and helping Iran, so that's bad for Israel, that's bad for the United States, and that's bad for American interests.KELLY:  Marc Thiessen, thank you, sir.  THIESSEN:  Thanks, Megyn.KELLY:  Also breaking tonight, new reaction to rumors that Mitt Romney may yet jump into the 2016 race.  Not only did Anne Romney say something recently, but the man who has been the architect of Romney's last campaign has raised some eyebrows too, and he's here.  He's here.Plus, it's make it or break it time for the 15 Republican candidates still in this race.  And we still -- we have a brand new poll out tonight on who is suddenly facing real, new trouble.  Stirewalt is here and Howie Kurtz is here too.  And then the New York Times publishes a profile of Donald Trump's wife that is anything but flattering -- and as I said, these two guys are willing to weigh in on Melania Trump and the New York Times.  Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Well, the media has covered virtually every move that Donald Trump has made in this campaign.  And now two high-profile publications are focused on his wife, Melania.  The New York Times running a piece describing her as the silent partner, the Washington Post calling her ""New Model for first lady,"" both pieces focus on Mrs. Trump's career as a model and her background as an immigrant, both reports are creating some controversy.  We'll explain why.  Joining me now Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News Digital Politics Editor, and Howie Kurtz, Host of Fox News' Media Buzz.  So this, from the New York Times, Howie, that talks about her modeling career referring to her as a mannequin, instead of a model, focusing on the salacious moments in her modeling career, and then writing -- not for her husband's Presidential aspirations, she might resemble that of any number of trophy spouses in New York, really?HOWARD KURTZ, ""MEDIABUZZ"" HOST:  That jumped off the page at me.  On this surface this piece looks like its describing Melania Trump as being sexy and glamorous.  But it is so condescending, trophy spouse, and what other potential first lady gets treated like this.  There was even a tweet that the Times later deleted -- that Melania had posted on her twitter account that showed a close-up of her in a very skimpy bikini bottom -- its being salacious and condescending to a woman who is obviously a devoted mother and isn't into politics.KELLY:  What has she done, Chris to deserve the ire of the New York Times?  They seem to be irritated that she's not some strident feminist who doesn't believe in walking the runway as a model.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  It's probably easier for her when her husband was a Democrat.  He is a Republican now. They are treating her -- you know this is not the first time we've seen a candidate spouse treated this way.  Senator McCain if you recall was -- got pretty rough treatment from the press and for some time.  And I will say that the technical term is grody and this sort of behavior is all too common.KELLY:  Mannequin, really?  Talking about her as a trophy wife -- if somebody else did this about a Democrat the New York Times would be crying sexism.  But they can do -- it's fair game because it's Donald Trump's wife and he's running as a Republican.  It's really disrespectful.  It is disrespectful to her.Let's move on.  Because there is something in the polls today that is not good for Jeb Bush.  A new poll has come out.  Donald Trump is the front runner by far, 25, Ben Carson's got 16, and way down below is Jeb Bush at 4 percent, Howie, 4.KURTZ:  This is just a stunning number for the former Governor of Florida.  It's time to say it out loud.  His campaign is not working very well.  He's not showing much passion.  He can't deliver a jab.  He speaks in policy speak and he has to fix this and fast.  As far as Trump having that big lead, all the pundits -- and you know who you are out there who said people are sick of him, he's declining, this guy is a charmer -- remarkable staying power.  But I would say the headline is Jeb, I respect what Jeb did in Florida but he can't run on a record from a decade ago.  KELLY:  What happened to all the Republicans, Chris, who said that they didn't about having a smooth talker or a great debater, they just wanted to find somebody -- true conservative on policy and so on, and Jeb Bush has got a conservative record in Florida, I understand the immigration issue and the common core issue.  But what's happening?STIREWALT:  I think what's happening here is Jeb Bush has too much competition.  I don't just mean with Trump who he -- with whom he unsuccessfully engaged for a period of time.  I mean that in this cycle, unlike in the previous cycle, what you saw Mitt Romney was, Romney stayed steady, he faced a series of four or five alternatives that shot up and then exploded.  He wasn't splitting the vote up with any other candidates on the more traditional side of the ballot.  This time, Jeb Bush has real competition.  Not just in the form of Ben Carson, not just in the form of Carly Fiorina, not just in the form John Kasich, but first and foremost, Marco Rubio and that's why Jeb Bush's campaign is on the attack...KELLY:  Do you believe, Chris, that some are suggesting that Jeb is done?  STIREWALT:  No.  It's still early.  You know what he's about to do?  He's about to scramble his eggs.  He's going to make a new campaign out of this because what they've done to this point has not worked.  And you cannot be running fifth or sixth.  You cannot be at four percent and make a credible argument that you are the inevitable one.KELLY:  Because even though they say it's causes cancer, it's so much easier to fry an egg on -- great to see you both.  KURTZ:  Thanks, Megyn.KELLY:  Well, we also have new reaction tonight, to suggestions that Mitt Romney might yet jump into this race, one of Romney's Chief 2012 Advisors, Stuart Stevens joins the Kelly File next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Former 2012 Republican Nominee Mitt Romney and his wife Anne Romney announced in January that they would not be running for the White House again after trying twice, but with no clear nominee yet in sight and loyal supporters pushing Mitt to get back in, could Romney's insistent note change?  Anne Romney recently told Fox's own Brian Kilmeade that they are ""Assessing this race.""  Stuart Stevens joins us now.  He's been called Mitt Romney's top political advisor and he's the Author of a new book, the Last Season, a father, a son, and lifetime of college football, Stuart, great to see you, thank you for being here tonight.  STUART STEVENS, THE LAST SEASON AUTHOR:  Good to see you, Megyn, thank you.KELLY:  For those who like Mitt Romney want him back in, is there room for hope?STEVENS:  I don't think Mitt Romney is going to run.  He's pretty straightforward.  He said he's not and I think everybody should just -- what you see is what you get.KELLY:  Why are they assessing?STEVENS:  You have to ask Anne Romney that.  I think it's something that a lot of people have asked him to do.  And I think they're being respectful to it.  It's clearly -- there's no dominant frontrunner, I think, they would be comfortable with, but I don't think he's going to run.KELLY:  So you're saying there's a chance.  All right, let's talk about the current frontrunner.  Because Romney made news when he came out and said Donald Trump is not going to be the nominee.  Why did he say that?  STEVENS:  Because he has good political sense and he's been to this process twice and he knows how it works.KELLY:  Why do you believe it?STEVENS:  The idea that I think anyone is going to be the nominee who has not been elected to some other political position is very, very remote.KELLY:  So you rule out Carson and Fiorina too.STEVENS:  Yeah, I do.  I have a lot of respect for them.  I don't think they'll be the nominee.  Look, I think a good question to ask is could this person be elected governor of the state they're running in. Could Donald Trump be elected Governor of Iowa, hard to imagine, Governor of New Hampshire, can't see it, South Carolina, not in a million years.KELLY:  But he's leading a lot in those polls, in New Hampshire he's a runaway.STEVENS:  In 2011 in April, Donald Trump was getting 26 percent.  We were joking about it with Mitt Romney.  There are a certain percentage of people that like -- we laughed about it. There are a certain percentage of people who like to vote for Donald Trump and say they are, but I think that after January 1st, the big difference in this year is that the Iowa Caucus is February 1st, not right after the New Year.  From January 2nd to the 1st of February, you're going to have a very intense period in this race and there's going to be a lot of movement.KELLY:  Stuart, I like to get your thoughts again, fascinating man. And you've done in a lot in politics, great to see you, good luck with your book.  STEVENS:  Great to see you, Megyn. Thank you.KELLY:  We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Before we go, Chris Mintz, the army vet who was shot seven times by the Oregon shooter while he tried to save lives needs help. He's facing a lot of medical bills and rehabilitation.  And we're going to post his Gofundme account at Facebook.com/thekellyfile.  There will likely be others who need your help as well, thank you for watching, everyone, this is ""The Kelly File.""Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" October 29, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN DELLA VOLPE, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: Young people are politically up for grabs. They care deeply about the country. They may disapprove of Obama relative to where he was in 2008, 2009, 2010. But the message from this poll is they don't like anything or anybody associated with Washington, D.C. Among the most enthusiastic of all segments within this 18 to 29-year-old cohort are young people who voted for Mitt Romney just a couple years ago. So Republicans are more enthusiastic.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: It's really interesting. You always hear young people are overwhelmingly going to vote Democratic. But Harvard has a new poll out.  First of all, the presidential approval rating with young people, take a look at this -- approval 43 percent, 53 percent disapprove. Now, congressional control, what is your preference for the outcome of the midterm elections in 2014? There you see all respondents at 50/43, but definite voters, 47 percent Democratic-led Congress, 51 percent Republican- led Congress.And just to give you some perspective, this Harvard University poll, if you look at the same question asked back in 2010, 55 percent definite voters, Democratic-led congress, 43 percent Republican-led Congress. And remember, 2010, huge gains for Republicans. They picked up 63 House seats.  It was a big Republican year.We're back with the panel. Steve, surprised by these numbers?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: A little bit. But if you go back and you look particularly at the polling of millennials after the revelations from Edward Snowden, after the NSA controversy, you saw an immediate and precipitous drop for President Obama's support among that age cohort. In an Economist poll that was taken two months after that he dropped 14 points.So I think that sort of accelerated a trend that we were already seeing with a movement away from the president. But it's still striking when you look at the fact that the president is underwater in approval- disapproval, the fact that these millennials say they want to vote Republicans. If you look at the extent to which the president won them and won them clearly in 2008, he won them by 34 points. In 2012, he won them by 23 points. This is a huge and dramatic shift. And I think it reflects the level of dissatisfaction with President Obama among the populace in general but among the people who worked hardest to elect them.BAIER: Yes, I mean, despite all a the things that we hear positively about the economy, there is still this angst, especially in young people, about where that job is going to be, living in their parents' home, all kinds of things, student loans.NINA EASTON, COLUMNIST, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: Yeah, you know I was there at the Institute of Politics in 2012 when they released that same survey. It was several months before the election and showed young voters more up for grabs. Obama was able to grab them. The economy looked like it had some trajectory, had some legs. I think these voters this year are responding to the same kinds of things that everybody else is responding to, that sense of dis-ease, unease about foreign policy, about the way this country is heading, about the stuttering economy, and the fact that they are dying under the weight of student loans. So, I think that all has an important impact.The other interesting thing is it's having the same impact on women. So, you are seeing the gender gap close. So I wanted to point out, one race in upstate New York you have, we're about to elect, the voters there are about to elect the youngest woman to Congress ever. She's 30 years old and she's a Republican. Her name is Elise Stefanik. So, it's very interesting.BAIER: She is leading there.EASTON: She is leading by a lot.BAIER: OK. Juan?WILLIAMS: Well, I think there is still a substantial gender gap between Republicans and Democrats. I think what's striking about this is that Democrats are so reliant right now, Bret, on turnout models. If you look at the difference between people who are registered voters and those who are likely voters, what you see is a shift typically from Democratic preference to Republican preference. And that symbolizes, I think, the energy in the Republican base right now for this midterm election, and the typically you get older, whiter, more conservative church-going people to vote rather than young people, the millennials.But then you come to this poll and you say, well, gee, you know what? Even if the Democrats are successful at pushing out a greater number of young people, this may not be the same group of young people that turned out in 2010. And that's definitely a problem for Democrats. Because if you get young people who do show up, voting with some Republican preference, well, that undermines so much of your turnout and model strategy going forward to November 4th.BAIER: Good point. That's it for the panel. But stay tuned for some relevant midterm analysis.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
