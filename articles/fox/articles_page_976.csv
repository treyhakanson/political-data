This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Today President Obama continued his European trip, attempting to talk tough about Russia just a few short weeks after being embarrassed by Vladimir Putin and Crimea. But our very own Charles Krauthammer, he wasn't fooled by the facade. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""THE O'REILLY FACTOR"")CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: They look down their noses, meaning the president and the secretary of state, at Putin and say he's a 19th century man. He doesn't understand the rules of the 21st century. Obama and Kerry are the ones living in a fantasy world. Putin is a 19th century man, and using the rules of that century in our century.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And here now with his take is the author of a brand new book -- I love baseball, he knows baseball as well as anybody -- ""A Nice Little Place on the North Side, Wrigley Field at One Hundred."" And that means he has a lot of patience, the patience of Job, Fox News contributor George Will. Good to see you in New York. How are you?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Couldn't be better.HANNITY: Let me start with what Charles is saying there and the president and his actions. More broadly, beyond Crimea, Vladimir Putin, but Syria, Egypt, the Arab spring, how would you assess this foreign policy?WILL: They really believe the world changed when we turned into the 21st century. They didn't notice the first thing that happened in the 21st century was an act of war against the United States in downtown Manhattan and at the Pentagon. They really think that war somehow is out of date. War is the great human constant. Western literature begins with Homer. It's all about war, and it's been war ever since, and it won't change.Scoop Jackson, a great Cold War Democratic senator said of the Soviet Union, and it's true of Putin. He said the Soviet Union is like a burglar walking down the hall of a hotel testing all the doors until it finds one that is open, and then he goes in. We have to make sure the doors are closed and he believes the doors are closed.HANNITY: Do you think he has ambitions beyond Crimea, maybe the Ukraine, maybe Estonia? Does he envision putting the band back together and the old Soviet Union coming back into existence?WILL: Absolutely. He's not Hitler, but he's read Hitler's playbook. Two days before the Munich conference Hitler gave a speech in 1938 September saying there are 10 million ethnic Germans, German speakers, living outside the borders of the Reich in the Sudetenland, in Czechoslovakia and in Poland. He said, ""It is intolerable for me to accept this. I would be unworthy to lead the German people."" I think Putin feels exactly the same way. If he can't bring them home to mother Russia, he's going to move Russia's borders out to get them.HANNITY: Before we get to baseball which is one of my other favorite topics, let me ask you about yet another delay. What does the latest delay in ObamaCare four years into this -- how often do you have a midterm election in 2010 and then a midterm election four years later, it's the same topic that is going to drive people to the polls on the very same issue? It doesn't happen. You talk about peace and prosperity driving elections. Obamacare for two elections?WILL: Obama is -- this is Obama at the improv. That suggests comedy, and this is a comedy, but it's not funny because he is traducing fundamental constitutional values and the separation of powers by assuming to himself the right to exclude Congress in the writing of statutes and in the rewriting of statutes. It's not permitted, and at the end of the day Congress has to stand up, assert itself, and stop it.HANNITY: Is Jonathan Turley right? Are we at a constitutional tipping point?WILL: I think so. Remember, this country was founded, Sean, in reaction against executive power, that of George III. It's been a constant theme of American life, trying to contain the president, who will expand whenever he can.HANNITY: OK. Over the years I've had many opportunities to get to know you, interview you. You're -- beyond your level of politics you have a passion, a love for baseball. And you wrote this book about Wrigley field at 100. Your beloved Cubs, are they going to win a World Series this year?WILL: This year?!(LAUGHTER)WILL: I don't think so.HANNITY: I'm looking for my Yankees to win this year.WILL: Last time they went to the World Series was 1908. That's two years before Mark Twain died and before Ronald Reagan was born. The last time they were in the World Series was 1945, when I was four years old. Not this year.HANNITY: Hard to be a Cubs fan, then?WILL: It's part of the fascination. Two things, the chemistry of loyalty that makes us loyal not just to the team but to the ballpark, to the radio announcer, to the team logo and colors. It's irrational, and that is part of fun of it.HANNITY: Does it bother you that the Yankees, for example, went out and paid for Tanaka this year, Ellsbury this year, Carlos Beltran this year? Is that just part of the free market or does it frustrate you that they can buy a successful team?WILL: Well, you can't buy a successful team reliably.HANNITY: Not reliably, but --WILL: They had the biggest payroll last year and they watched the postseason at home. Get who played in post season? Tampa, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Oakland, small market teams but very intelligently-run teams. Baseball has done a wonderful thing to improve competitive balance, partly by evening out the revenues with revenue sharing, and it just turns out money alone is not enough. It's like in politics. You can throw money at the wall and some will stick. If you throw money at problems you'll solve some, but not all of them. You have to have intelligence at the end of the day.HANNITY: Let me ask you this question. Putting aside steroids, anabolic steroids, what about something like human growth hormone, which we know aids in healing. These players have short periods of their life where they are eligible to play at a professional level. If it can aid and help in healing, modern medicine make that's possible, should that be allowed to be used specifically?WILL: I don't think so. There is no test yet for human growth hormones, although Major League Baseball is helping fund a study that will get that. It was human growth hormone -- probably, we don't know for sure -- that caused Barry Bonds' in his late 30s cap size to change.HANNITY: Don't you think it was more testosterone, anabolic steroids?WILL: We don't know. We do know there was chemistry was involved, and we did not want games settled by who has the best chemist.HANNITY: OK. Good to see you. Great book. I love watching my Yankees and Mets this year.WILL: Good.HANNITY: All right, George Will.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""The Kelly File"":  Breaking tonight.  Republican front- runner Donald Trump going after political elites, his opponents, and the entire election system in a way we have not seen before.  Welcome to THE KELLY FILE, everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly.  Donald Trump trading the podium for the pen, writing a  blistering piece in The Wall Street Journal, that has gotten a lot of headlines, including asking the following -- let me ask America a question, how has the system been working out for you and your family?  Accusing GOP Party insiders of disenfranchising voters and calling for a reform of the nomination process.  Trump coming out swinging now in a way that some say could enlarge his support beyond his core base.  And tonight, the RNC is responding. Releasing this memo stating the rules surrounding the delegate selection process have been clearly laid out.  Each process is easy to understand for those willing to learn it.  Joining me now, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor.  Chris, good to see you.  CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  Howdy!KELLY:  Howdy!  So, what essentially is Donald Trump doing with this piece?STIREWALT:  So it's one thing to say that you think the system needs to be reformed, and because remember, he's a populist.  And like populist progressives, they want more direct democracy.  Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump agree.  So that's one thing say and hear, reform the system and make it work better.  That means in the future, because we're almost already done with this one, that's different than what he was doing before.  Because what he was doing before was saying Ted Cruz is winning by cheating.  It's cheating, it's cheating, it's cheating.  What he realized, I think, or his campaign realized, now that there is actually (audio gap) something like a campaign around him (audio gap), he's hiring these K Street guys.  He's getting the people --   KELLY:  Like Paul Manafort, he knows what he's doing.  STIREWALT:  Yes.  Exactly.  If he's done it for (audio gap) before, and for Vladimir (audio gap) friends in the Ukraine, he can probably figure out the Colorado delegate apportionment process.  KELLY:  Yes.STIREWALT:  But what Trump is doing, it's going legit, it's saying, I'm going to make a substantive argument about larger issues, I'm going to talk about this up here, not just say that I hate Ted Cruz and he's a cheater, cheater, and --  KELLY:  Well, he still is still kind of -- he is still talking about the system being rigged.  STIREWALT:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.KELLY:  And you know, he's not a fan of Ted Cruz, we know this.  Nor vice versa.  But it seems interesting, because everybody is looking at Trump right now whether he's going to do the pivot and try to enlarge his support.  You know, his theory about the 5th Avenue rule, he can kill anybody -- he said shoot --  STIREWALT:  Just maiming.  (LAUGHTER)KELLY:  They might leave if there had been an actual death.  STIREWALT:  Right.KELLY:  But the shooting he says, and they wouldn't leave him and he has been proven right.  And of course, that was all a joke, but what he meant was, my supporters are loyal to me.  And now, the question is, they're not going to leave him if he reaches out a little bit.  If he reaches out in a way that maybe they wouldn't have liked six moments ago but could be acceptable to them now.  Is that what he's doing?STIREWALT:  I think he's tried before and had limited success.  But what he understands now is that he needs the Republican establishment in order to get this done.  Most likely scenario playing out right now is that he gets to the convention in Cleveland, just short.  Hundred short let's say or 150 short.  And if he comes in short, you know what he's going to need?  Unbound delegates to come and give him their support, because as we've talked about, if he can't win on the first ballot, it's going to be very hard for him to win the --   KELLY:  But can I ask you --  STIREWALT:  Yes.KELLY:  Can I ask you because Trump is out there tonight saying, I think I'm going to get there to 1237 by the convention.  STIREWALT:  Sure.KELLY:  I know that they all say -- even Ted Cruz is saying, I'm going to do it.  He's exactly not going to do it.STIREWALT:  Right.KELLY:  But Donald Trump is the one who has a shot.  And my question to you is, is there a way that's not absurd that Trump could do it?  I mean, you know like obviously Ted Cruz could do it.  He would have to win everything--  STIREWALT:  Right.  Right.  KELLY: -- entirely from this point forward, which he's not going to do.  STIREWALT:  Right.KELLY:  So, Is there a way that's not absurd for Trump to do it?  STIREWALT:  Well, it's substantially less absurd.  And basically what it means is, you run up the score in New York, you tripped the winner take all on a statewide and on district levels, across the state, you take a bunch of delegates there.  And then for Trump, it basically comes down to shoot the moon in California.  And there's no state that has responded better where white voters has responded better to his rhetoric on immigration that it is in California.  And go to California and just crush it.  There are so many delegates in California that it's conceivable, and it's not absurd that he could do it.  However, you know what we've seen from Ted Cruz?  People vote for him, and he's become better as a candidate.  He has improved to some degree.  And Republicans seem to be more accepting of Cruz than they were at the beginning.  So I think the shape of the race is here.  John Kasich is strictly absurd, 138 -- he'll have to reinvent the Pythagorean Theorem in order to somehow become the Republican nominee.  But--  KELLY:  Chris paid attention in Math.  STIREWALT:  Just to get out of it.  But we know that for Trump, it is possible.  It's just remote and he needs that in terms of policy of some establishment supporters on his side.  KELLY:  Fascinating.  Great to see you, sir.  STIREWALT:  You bet.  KELLY:  So, for more reaction to this, we put together a little panel, a little panel for you.  Maybe you saw a little bit of this panel last night. New York Republican voters who will vote in four days and we asked them what they think of Mr. Trump's criticism of the nominating process.  Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Raise your hand if you think Trump has a point that the system is rigged.  Interesting.  Even some non-Trump supporters believe that.  In the back, in the back, why do you think that?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it's an example that came out yesterday, John Kasich's wife made a statement, keep supporting John Kasich so we can continue to deny the nomination to Trump.  To me, that's pretty telling.  KELLY:  But that's strategy.  Right?  That's strategy.  They're arguing about whether the system, as created, is rigged to deny like a non-party endorsed person, which is Trump's claim.  Yes?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not that it's rigged, it's way too complicated and way too problematic.  It's not rigged.KELLY:  Doesn't everyone agree on that?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.KELLY:  I mean, that's not a point of contention.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But we should change the system (audio gap) in the Republican and Democratic side.  There's no rigging, it's just an issue of the system itself.  KELLY:  But that's in the next election.  I mean, it seems like the Trump people are upset about this.  Yes.  Go ahead.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In some of these states, there's been a direct effort to take the vote of the voters in the primary, Donald Trump is one, and they've gone around and tried to pick delegates who don't agree with the voters of their own state.  KELLY:  So that they can be freed up on the second vote -- so that they can be freed up on the second vote if they get to a second vote?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Absolutely.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have a whole situation here where Donald Trump and all the other candidates knew in August what the rules of the Colorado convention were going to be.  And they could put a ground game in.  Donald Trump chose not to.  So, whether or not he was competent, I'll let the voters decide.  But he's trying to tweet his way to the presidency.  You can't do that.  KELLY:  Go ahead.  In the front.  In the front here.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's not too complicated for Cruz to figure it out. He has a really good ground game, he is gaining delegates.  Trump just hired a state director in California.KELLY:  Paul Manafort.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And Trump is, you know, he's losing one state after another.  When is he going to catch on and how the system works?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why are they so afraid of Trump?  What is it about Trump that they're so afraid of?KELLY:  Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You know, what?  The way I feel, just like this young lady said, Cruz is smart enough to figure it out.  It's about the delegates.  And one of the things, Trump is always saying he's going to surround himself with the best and brightest.  Where were the best and brightest to tell him you have to go and you have to talk with the delegates and win them?  And two of his children didn't even know to change their registration so they could vote for their father in the primary.  KELLY:  Hello?(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)Okay.  Go ahead.  In the front.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It shouldn't have to do anything with the delegates.   This should be about the voter, voting for who they want to be the nominee. Right now, if you look at it now, who is gaining?  Trump, Bernie Sanders. The voters do not want a politician.  We want an outsider.  Overwhelmingly, the country wants an outsider.  And, you know, I've seen this in my own town.  I'm not going to use the word rigged because it's not that it's rigged.  It's at the way the system is designed, it benefits the incumbents and it benefits the party bosses.  I see it on the national level.  I see it in my own town where I live, the same thing, they have a caucus.  If somebody wants to get in, you know, we have 7,000 registered Republicans in my town.  Two hundred people show up to the caucus.  KELLY:  Now, here's my question.  Here's my question.  So, they're not going to change the rules midway through.  But the question is whether this is going to motivate Trump supporters like nothing else.  Like, they're going to come out in droves now in the remaining elections, because they're more motivated ever to make their voices heard.  Yes.  Go ahead.  In front of you.  Yes.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The only thing that Donald Trump is doing is dividing America, dividing the minority groups, dividing the Latinos, dividing the African-Americans.  That's the only thing Donald Trump is doing.  I mean, look what happened today in Long Island.  Look what happened today here in New York City.  So he's not winning the minority votes.  He's never going to be a president of the United States, no way he's going to become president.  KELLY:  Yes.  In the middle.  In the middle.  In the middle of the middle. You.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh.  How was he able to amass all of these millions and millions of votes if he's a divider?  I would think he's a uniter.  (ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's so absurd that we're talking about the caucus that is really the closest to the people.  Every person in Colorado that was Republican was invited to go to the caucus.  Donald Trump, it's all his own fault.  He refused.  He scheduled to go and didn't even step his toe in Colorado.  KELLY:  What about that?  What about that because he did not go to that caucus and Ted Cruz did?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They voted for delegates who were not bound.  I mean, that's like you give your children a vote, what do you want to eat tonight? This food or that food, they tell you and you say no, you can't have it. These delegates, they vote --  (ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE)KELLY:  Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is a forum to set up how we vote.  This is the actual vote.  When he doesn't win, then the forum is all wrong.  (ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE)KELLY:  Sir, in the front.  I can see that you're a Ted Cruz supporter.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When you have a game, a baseball game, whatever, and both teams agree to follow the rules and one loses, it can't say oh, it's not fair.  They both have the same rules.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Feisty panel.  We'll have more with them later.  So, now we've heard from some of the voters.  And up next, the RNC chairman will speak about the candidates, the convention, and what happens if this comes down to a floor fight?  Plus, Mitt Romney has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump.  So tonight, we're speaking with Mr. Romney's niece about why she will be voting Trump on the first ballot in Cleveland.  Plus, the President's executive order on immigration will face its biggest challenge yet on Monday when the Supreme Court is asked to decide whether he has violated the constitution.  And the lawyer fighting the White House is here tonight before his big battle.  Then critics are fuming about a new movie they say is an attempt to revise history and changed the way we look at the Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill situation.  Both sides tonight with an unbelievable segment.  Don't go away.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You have to understand that this kind of response is not a typical and I can't explain it.  It takes an expert in psychology to explain how that can happen.  But it can happen.  Because it happened to me.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The Republicans want to play cute with us, right?  If I don't make it, you're going to have millions of people that don't vote for a Republican, they're not going to vote at all. Millions of people.  They're very, very angry and they're disenfranchised.  And then we have a rigged system on top of it.  But despite the rigging, I think we get there before the convention.  I think we do.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  That was Donald Trump just a few hours ago at a rally in Hartford, Connecticut as his fight with the RNC carries on.  A new FOX poll shows the businessman has widened his lead nationally.  Mr. Trump now stands at 45 percent, 18 points ahead of his closest competitor.  Ted Cruz has lost support while John Kasich is also picking up momentum.  Still, the question remains, will anyone actually clinch the nomination before the July convention?  Earlier I spoke with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus about the possibility of a contested contention.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Everybody is looking forward to this July convention, wondering what is going to happen.  I understand that on the first vote, if Trump doesn't get 1237 or nobody does, then many of the delegates become unbound on the second vote.  And then they move on to the third vote, they're saying anything can happen, maybe they can go to somebody outside of the three men who are now running.  Is that -- how would that happen?  I know that that's not the likeliest scenario, but if they did decide okay, Cruz can't get it, Kasich can't, Trump can't, who would decide who the other potential candidate is?REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  The delegates on the floor would.  I mean, I think it's highly unlikely, Megyn, but if playing out your hypothetical, if we go through 25 ballots and no one can get to the majority, then the body would decide, you know, who the potential nominee would be.  KELLY:  People just start throwing out names like the delegates -- the delegates can just start throwing out names, and if they get what, like a majority of the delegates to say yes, let's get that person in or how does it work?PRIEBUS:  Whoever can get the majority votes of the delegates on the floor is going to be the nominee of the party.  Now, I think that hypothetical is highly unlikely --  KELLY:  Uh-hm.PRIEBUS:  But if you play it out, that's what the rules say.  The majority rules and whatever the majority on the floor decides is who the nominee is going to be.  KELLY:  So some buzz could get going among the delegates, they could be like, you know, General Mattis, or whatever it is and then it goes from there.  Let me ask you this.  So, between June 7th when California votes among other states in July, you know, the end of July when the convention happens, these candidates are allowed to woo the delegates, like they can, you know, they can wine them, they can dine them, they can't give them cash, but they can do a bunch of other stuff.  So what do you think we should expect to see if no one has a clear majority as of June 7th, what do you think Trump is going to do with these delegates?  What do you anticipate Cruz is going to do with them?PRIEBUS:  I have no idea, Megyn.  You know, here's the thing for everyone to understand.  No one has been through this before.  There are no experts at this process.  So, the last time we had a multi-ballot convention was in 1940.  So, you know, I know we're filling a lot of space on television, but no one really knows what to expect.  KELLY:  That's got to be disconcerting for you.  PRIEBUS:  Well, you know, listen, I mean, it is, because you always have to back down a lot of narratives.  I think we spend a lot of time on hypotheticals that I don't think are going to be reality.  I do think that the people running have the advantage.  I think this sort of hypothetical of some 25th ballot thing happening is very unlikely.  But we have to be ready for anything, and this is something that's new for our party and we don't know whether Ted Cruz or Donald Trump can actually get to the majority before the convention, which would put all of this to rest.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.PRIEBUS:  But we will be prepared as a party and that's my job is for us to be prepared and to help people understand the process --  KELLY:  Do you do any like meditation technique --   (CROSSTALK)You may need to have some Eastern medicine or something introducing into your life between now and July.  It's just a thought.  You take it or reject it at your leisure.  PRIEBUS:  You bet.  KELLY:  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  Great to see you.  PRIEBUS:  You bet.  Thank you.  KELLY:  Well, my next guest has pledged to support Donald Trump at the convention, at least on the first ballot.  Ronna Romney McDaniel is chairman of the Michigan Republican Party.  And yes, she is a member of that Romney family.  Ronna, thank you so much for being here.  So your uncle is not going to like this.  Does he know that you're going vote for Donald Trump?RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, MICHIGAN REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIRMAN:  I left that up to my dad to tell my uncle.  That was not a phone call I wanted to make. I'm pretty sure I'm out of the will at this point.  (LAUGHTER)KELLY:  But wait.  You're doing this as a delegate in Michigan, right?MCDANIEL:  I'm actually the chair of the Michigan Republican Party, and I recognize that on March 8, Michiganders came in record numbers, we had 1.3 million Republicans come out in our election.  It was wonderful.  We want those voters engaged in the process.  So, as an RNC delegate, I chose to bind myself to the majority of the vote of Michigan.  I remain neutralist chair but I will be a Trump delegate in Cleveland.  KELLY:  What about on the second ballot, that's the big question with the Trump delegates, will they stick by him on the second ballot if we get there?MCDANIEL:  That's a great question.  I think as chair, it's incumbent upon me to show the voters that I am willing to represent them in Cleveland.  So my intention is to stay with the voters of Michigan, to show them that the Michigan Republican Party is not disenfranchising their vote.  We'll see what happens in Cleveland.  We're not there yet, thank goodness.  KELLY:  So you think Trump has a point when he says, you know, what about all those people who went and voted?  You know, because he's used that word, that they would be disenfranchised if their delegates abandoned their orders, if you will, on the second ballot, even though the rules allow abandonment at that point.  MCDANIEL:  I'm in a little different role as chair of the party.  Because I have to unify everybody at the end.  And if they feel like I'm playing games, it's hard for them to trust me as we go into a creedal coalition (ph).  But there are two parts of this election, which is the candidates. They know the rules.  They've been in place since October of 2015.  But the voters don't know the rules.  This is a whole new process to them.  It's getting more attention than it's ever received.  So in Michigan, we have worked very hard to be transparent, to explain to them the process, because we need them to trust us.  So they'll go vote for our candidate in November.  KELLY:  Do you like Donald Trump?  Do you personally support his candidacy or are you not taking a position on that?MCDANIEL:  I support any of our candidates about Hillary Clinton.  I'm going to be supporting our nominee wholeheartedly going into November.  KELLY:  Quick question for you.  So you're in Michigan.  This is a state in which Kasich and Trump kind of cut a deal.  I don't want to get into the weeds because it's tough to understand.  But when it came to the delegate allegation, they kind of cut the deal and Ted Cruz got kicked off.  And it lead to a lot of people saying, Trump and Kasich are going to work together.  Kasich could be Trump's VP.  This is all a VP play by John Kasich.  Did they were together in a way that made you wonder whether they have a coalition, Trump and Kasich?MCDANIEL:  It was actually more about personal relationships after our convention.  We did have a meeting of delegates to select who would serve on the rules committee, the credentials committee and the platform committee in Cleveland.  And you only have two spots for each of those committees.  So I'm not surprised that two of the campaigns cut a deal. And I think more of that was based on personal relationships between the delegates representing each of those candidates.  KELLY:  Ronna, enjoy the skiing in, I guess it will be Colorado next year, not Utah.  Great to see you.  MCDANIEL:  Great to see you.  Thank you.  KELLY:  All the best.  So we're less than 72 hours away from a critical moment in the fight over illegal immigration, as the U.S.  Supreme Court on Monday, prepares to hear some 26 states argue that President Obama is defying the constitution with his executive orders protecting some millions of illegal immigrants in the country right now.  We have a primetime exclusive tonight with the man who will lead that argument on Monday coming up.  Plus, as the Democratic Party finds itself growing further apart, can the Republicans come together?  Our panel is back on that.  Wait until you hear what they have to say, next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Raise your hand, Cruz people, if you could get behind Trump.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right here.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  At this point, it would be very difficult, but we have to.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, yes.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER:  From the World Headquarters of FOX News, it's THE KELLY FILE with Megyn Kelly.  KELLY:  Welcome back to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders squared off last night in their last face-to-face meeting before Tuesday's New York primary.  It turned out to be a debate so contentious, it's being dubbed ""Brawl in Brooklyn.""  Here's just a sample.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.  HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You know, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Wait.  Come on.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS:  That's just not accurate.CLINTON: I have stood on the debate stage with Senator Sanders eight prior times.SANDERS:  Excuse me.  CLINTON:  I have said the exact same thing.  WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  Secretary, Senator, please --  CLINTON:  If we can raise it to $15 in New York or Los Angeles or Seattle, let's do it.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER:  Secretary, the viewers -- if you're both screaming at each other, the viewers won't be able to hear either of you.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Hmm.  Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry just filed this report on what came after that.  Ed.ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, tonight, Hillary Clinton is far from New York.  She's in San Francisco for the first of two fundraisers with George (audio gap) Clooney, scaring up funds because Bernie Sanders has been outraising her big-time.  Sanders is even further away.  He flew thousands of miles into the Vatican, not for a meeting with Pope Francis.  The Democratic socialist attended a conference, what he calls a moral economy, drawing inspiration from the Pope's own calls to get greed out of Wall Street.  A gamble to go that far a few days before this critical New York primary, but maybe Sanders and Clinton simply wanted to get out of dodge after a nasty Brooklyn brawl that may be their final face-to-face debate of this entire campaign.  A feisty Sanders landed jabs.  But the Clinton camp thinks he came across as angry and again struggled with specifics on how Wall Street money impacted her votes in the Senate.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example.  It is important -- it is important -- it's always important, it maybe inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight.  I stood up against these behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.  I called them out.  SANDERS:  Secretary Clinton called them out?  Oh, my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this.  (CROWD CHEERING)(END VIDEO CLIP)HENRY:  Bottom-line, this race has tightened nationally.  The latest FOX poll showing Clinton is only up a couple of points, though she still has a double digit lead right here in New York and it will take a herculean effort for Sanders to catch Clinton in her adopted home state.  But win or lose Tuesday, Sanders now has the money to stay in this race all the way until the Democratic convention in July, making this a longer, nastier struggle than Clinton ever imagined -- Megyn.    KELLY:  Oh, boy.  Ed, thank you.  As the Democratic candidates attack each other, does it open the door for the GOP to unite, and ultimately, defeat the Democrats come November? That's the question we presented to our panel of New York Republican voters last night.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, THE KELLY FILE SHOW HOST:  All right.  So first of all, raise your hand it is you're a Trump supporter.  Trump supporters, could you ever get behind Ted Cruz?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  We have to.  KELLY:  Is there any Trump supporter who could not support Ted Cruz?  One, Boris, that's it.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would have a tough time.  Actually, the New York values, I think it was a siren call against Jews and anti-Semitism.  KELLY:   Oh, you do?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do.  Remember the West Wing episode?(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Oh, boy.(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Do you think it was an anti-Semitic remark?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No!UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Can I say something?  Ted Cruz was just saying, just sort of echo a little bit of this sort of parallel, I think as a New Yorker, what I would like other New Yorkers at home that are going to vote on Tuesday to remember, for the last 7-1/2 years, as Republicans and conservatives, we've all complained about how Obama had no platform, he has no policy, and he's a danger to American national security, and to our infrastructure.  He's like the enemy within, and a lot of people feel that way.  On the flip side, Trump is literally the parallel on the right side of what Obama is.  He does not have policy.  He is.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How can you say that?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He wants to pull out of NATO.  The man is actually a danger.  And Ted Cruz is the only one who consistently this entire time in the Senate, fought for everything that American voters asked the Republicans to do.  He single handedly fought for every single one of those issues.  And now, people are going to be blinded by celebrity and try to vote for Donald Trump.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's a first-term senator.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Go.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If he really accomplished so much, how come he's not winning?(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you watching the same election that everybody else is watching?(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Go ahead.  Are you done?  Go ahead.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The fact that you can turn around and compare Obama to Donald Trump is ridiculous.  First of all, Obama, first term senator, community organizer, extremely anti-American, let's not forget Reverend Wright.  KELLY:  Let's not go over the top.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Donald Trump built a business, someone who has dealt with the intricacies of New York City to build skyscrapers.  This is a smart man.  Let me tell you something, out of everyone up there.(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  OK.  You, sir.  (CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One of the things that's good, we see the middle ground is Kasich.  Kasich is the one who really has been battlefield tested and if they need somebody to get behind, if he is not in front, he is the one of substance.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Let me ask about that.  Trump and Cruz people, could you get behind John Kasich?  Raise your hand if you could.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.KELLY:   No?  Not at all?(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  So wait, Kasich people, could you -- raise your hand if you could get behind Donald Trump, raise your hand.  Kasich people, could you get behind Ted Cruz.  So you're open.  But we didn't ask the Cruz people whether they could ever get behind Donald Trump.  Raise your hand, Cruz people, if you could get behind Trump.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right here.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  At this point, it would be very difficult, but we have to.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Raise your hand if you would never do it.  Why?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Donald Trump has absolutely no respect for women.  As a Republican woman, I get questioned, you're too smart to be a Republican, why are you a Republican?  He has zero respect from day one, to bringing up a spouse's medical history, how he treated Carly, frankly, how he treated you, Megyn, this is a disgrace.  And I don't understand how any Republican woman could vote for Donald Trump.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  They're saying would you rather have Hillary?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No to Hillary.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  They're saying would you rather have Hillary?  That's what they're asking.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No to Hillary.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Feisty panel.  I'm going to start doing this more.  (LAUGHTER)KELLY:  Coming up on Monday, it's the Supreme Court versus the commander- in-chief.  As more than half the states in the nation suggest that President Obama's executive action on immigration defies the Constitution.  There are some big stakes in this case on Monday and the Texas attorney general Ken Paxton is leading the charge.  He's next.  Plus, a new HBO movie revisits the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas hearings, that captivated the nation so many years ago.  One former Bush administration member is here, and he says this movie gives Anita Hill more credibility than she deserves.  We'll have both sides.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Unless you kowtow to the old order, this is what will happen to you.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  It may be one of the biggest challenges yet to President Obama's legacy.  On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments regarding the president's executive actions on immigration, an order that would allow an estimated four million people or more who are here in the U.S. illegally to stay, and obtain legal status.  With more than half of the state of the nation arguing that the commander-in-chief is trampling on the Constitution here, this is turning out to be about much more than just immigration policy.  Joining us now, a primetime exclusive, Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton.  Good to see you, Sir.  Thank you for being here.KEN PAXTON, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Thanks for having me here.  KELLY:  So how do you like your chances on Monday?PAXTON:  I think we have a great case.  We think it's very clear that he violated the Constitution and this specific executive action is clearly illegal.  KELLY:  You won repeatedly on this issue.  You challenged the executive order saying he was out of bounds constitutionally.  You've won, you've won, and you've won again.  Now, you go up to the Supreme Court, that's one man down because of the death of Justice Scalia.  PAXTON:  Right.KELLY:  How does that affect your chances?PAXTON:  You know, we're very optimistic.  We won at the Fifth Circuit twice.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  That's a more conservative leaning court.  PAXTON:  Yes, but we feel very strongly about our chances, because this is such a strong constitutional argument.  KELLY:  What happens if court rejects your argument and sides with the Obama administration, do the executive actions on illegal immigration stand and the four million people can stay and obtain legal status?PAXTON:  So basically if we lost, the injunction would go away and we would have the trial on the merits.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  So if you lose, it doesn't mean everyone could stay.PAXTON:  That's right.KELLY:  It just means you'll have to have a trial?PAXTON:  That's right.  KELLY:  Why do you think he overstepped his bounds?  The administration says prosecutorial discretion, we get to decide how to allocate resources, and we don't have the resources to go deport these four million people.  PAXTON:  let me give you the premise (inaudible).  Over a six-year period, he said I can't do this, it's up to Congress.(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  I know.  But now he says, I was wrong.  He says I'm not a king, now he says I am a king.  (CROSSTALK)PAXTON:  He said over 20 times, but then, when he actually changed the law, he actually came out and said, I changed the law.  It is his own words when he signed the executive action into law.KELLY:  Will the court look at that?  What he said?PAXTON:  We brought it up.  We hope they will.  KELLY:  He says look, there's a 2012 case, Arizona versus the United States, this is the administration.  They say this is from the court, Justice Anthony Kennedy writing for the court, discretion and enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate human concerns.  Unauthorized workers try and support their families for example likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit serious crimes.  They say all they need to do is get Justice Kennedy to come over to the side of the liberals, and use this sentence, and win.  PAXTON:  Yeah.  But this isn't discretion.  This is changing what Congress said and doing just the opposite.  This isn't prosecutorial discretion, this is clearly changing law in a major way, it's not tweaking.  KELLY:  Are you predicting victory?PAXTON:  We're very encouraged.  KELLY:  Ken, great to see you.  Thank you for being here.PAXTON:  Thank you for having me on.KELLY:  All the best.  Good luck.  PAXTON:  Thank you.KELLY:  And next, the executive producer and writer of the new HBO movie confirmation is here to talk about politics, gender and race that captivated the nation 25 years ago.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Is there any basis for it?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  None.  She worked for me.  I treated her the same way I treat other people.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Why is she saying this?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't know.  How can I answer that?  Someone lies about me, how am I supposed to know why?  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Tomorrow night, HBO will be premiering a new docudrama entitled Confirmation.  And it's already generating some controversy.  It tells the story to some extent of the explosive 1991 Supreme Court nomination and confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas where Anita Hill, a 35-year-old law professor from Oklahoma, testified she had been sexually harassed by the nominee.  At the time, the hearings stirred controversy about race, gender, and sexual harassment in the workplace.  Now, the movie has drawn fire from some of the folks involved in the process.  Here's a clip. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why in God's name when he left his position of power or status, or authority over you, why in God's name would you ever speak to a man like that for the rest of your life?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's a very good question.  And I am sure that I cannot answer it to your satisfaction.  That is one of the things that I have tried to do here today.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a circus.  It's national disgrace.  From my standpoint, as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, it's a high tech lynching for blacks who in any way deemed to think for themselves, do for themselves, to have different ideas.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Wow.  In moments, we'll be joined by Susannah Grant, the executive producer and writer of Confirmation.  And Mark Paoletta, a Former George H.W. Bush administration lawyer who helped usher Clarence Thomas through his Supreme Court confirmation.  We begin tonight with Mark.  Mark, good to see you.MARK PAOLETTA, FORMER GEORGE H.W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION LAWYER:  Thank you.   Thank you for having me.  KELLY:  So you read the screen play -- the script for this movie?PAOLETTA:  That's right.  KELLY:  And you didn't like it from the start.  Why?PAOLETTA:  It was fundamentally dishonest.  What I saw an intentional effort to leave out the damaging testimony that undermined Anita Hill's testimony.  KELLY:  Like what, can you remember anything for example?PAOLETTA:  Sure.  One of the things that the American people remember that she went from one job to another, she claimed she was harassed on the Department of Education.KELLY:  By Clarence Thomas.PAOLETTA:  By Clarence Thomas.  And then she moved to the EOC with Clarence Thomas.  Who does that?  That's in the movie, OK, but it took three explanations why she went with him that were fundamentally false and proven false during the hearings.  That's what the American people saw and that's why they determined at the end of this hearing, trusted Clarence Thomas, 2- 1.  KELLY:  Do you think she made the whole thing up?PAOLETTA:  I do believe she made the whole thing up.  I think she got caught in a lie.  And some of her witnesses, the timetables didn't match up.  But I do believe she told a lie.KELLY:  Why would she lie about it?PAOLETTA:  I think she left her old law firm and she told some friends she had been sexually harassed.(CROSSTALK)PAOLETTA:  At the law firm.  And it happened long before she ever worked with him.  KELLY:  You think she wanted attention?PAOLETTA:  She got caught in a lie and she doubled down, and went forward with this lie.  And again, the movie shows her -- when the Senate Committee contacts her, immediately cooperating.  Anita Hill tried to take down Clarence Thomas with an anonymous complaint.  And her demand is that Thomas not know her name.  KELLY:  But do you think that can be because she was his victim and she didn't want to face him?  I think that's another explanation.PAOLETTA:  I think she was trying to manipulate the process and take him down without having to come forward.  KELLY:  How do you think these hearings -- the nation was captivated by these hearings at that time.  PAOLETTA:  Yeah.(TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY)KELLY:  --a huge role in this.  PAOLETTA:  Right.  KELLY:  And they were not exactly on Ms. Hill's side.  PAOLETTA:  I think Joe Biden was very much.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Sorry.  (Inaudible) was not on her side at all.  PAOLETTA:  He was asking fair questions of how the story added up.  KELLY:  What is your problem with the movie, other than not including the things to diminish her credibility?PAOLETTA:  Right.  Well, again, it's an effort to rewrite the history to show Anita was more credible than she was.  KELLY:  Why?  Why do that?PAOLETTA:  To make it like she was telling the truth and Clarence Thomas is lying.  KELLY:  All right.  Stand by.  Because we have Susannah Grant with us, too.   She is the executive producer and writer of Confirmation.  Susannah, your thoughts on Mark's charge there?SUSANNAH GRANT, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND WRITER OF CONFIRMATION:  Well, I first want to tell you that I reached out to Mark Paoletta while I was working on this script a few times and I would have welcomed his input.  I reached out to as many people as I possibly could who are involved in the hearings, affiliated with both of the parties.  And I wanted, my intention all along was to get this as truthful and as accurate as possible.  I really would have welcomed his input then.  (CROSSTALK)GRANT:  Look, I'm not in the business of defending Anita Hill.  She can do that herself.  But I will say that there's a tremendous amount of independent documentation of these hearings done by very experienced journalists and you will find that the points that Mr. Paoletta brings up just don't pass muster when you really dig in to the facts.  KELLY:  Do you feel like you have an opinion?  Having written the script, do you have an opinion about whether Anita Hill was telling the truth?GRANT:  You know, Megyn, what I figured out at the absolute outset of this was that there are only two people who know what happened between those two people.  And you know, who knows if they're really even clear on it?  So I went into this with the clear understanding that I could never answer that question.  That wasn't what was interesting to me.  I don't think that's what's most interesting about these hearings.  What I think is interesting about these hearings that they were a watershed event in our collective cultural history.  They completely changed how we perceive and talk about women's rights in the workplace.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  One of the first times to hear about sexual harassment in the workplace, 1991.  It's not that it hasn't been happening, it's that this shined a big spotlight on it.  Whether it happened in this case is a different question.  But this did shine a big problem -- spotlight on that issue.  GRANT:  Absolutely.  And the reason it was as explosive and the reason it captivated everyone's attention so much was because it was an unnamed unease within so many women's experiences.  This unfairness in their workplace and another thing that I really like about it, there's sort of an uncredited character in the movie and that's the American citizenry.  We have a lot of scenes where the phones in the senators' offices started ringing off the hook and it's the American people demanding that their representatives follow through on this.  They were not going to reconvene the hearings until the American people called up and said no.  This is something we really want to pay attention to.  I insist that you as my representative pay attention to this.  KELLY:  And yet.GRANT:  And they did.  I get very inspired by this.  KELLY:  I have a question for you.  To what extent -- people believe that after Robert Bork was defeated, and that was the first time the process turned political.  It used to be if you're a qualified judge, good judge, you got on the bench.  Scalia got on there 98-0 even though they knew he was a conservative.  His judicial philosophy wasn't a secret.  And with Robert Bork, it started to change and the Republicans felt it's a continuation of that, they're doing it now to another nominee.  Is that political angle well covered?GRANT:  I hope so.  It's certainly -- I hope you'll see the movie and you'll see that's actually how we start the movie, with the complete politicization of the confirmation process.  And obviously, that was a huge factor in this -- in the whole process.  KELLY:  They felt that.(CROSSTALK)GRANT:  I'm very interested in the clash of the profoundly political and intensely personal that this dramatized.  KELLY:  Well, I mean, the acting looks spectacular.  The clip alone is intriguing.  Susannah, thank you very much.  Mark, you're still here.  Did you want to say something?PAOLETTA:  Sure.  I find it interesting.  A couple years later, Anita Hill goes on television and defends Bill Clinton against sexual harassment and sexual assault charges in 1998.  KELLY:  Uh-huh.  Fascinating.  I think we have piqued the audience's curiosity.  Thank you for being here, Mark and Susannah.  PAOLETTA:  Thanks for having me.KELLY:  We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  What do you think those Anita Hill allegations?  Did you believe her at the time?  Go to facebook.com/thekellyfile.  Follow me on Twitter, @megynkelly.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, just 24 hours after the big Republican debate. Media outlets across America are now declaring this contest effectively a four-man race. And tonight, two of the four will be right here.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. Seven men squared off last night and one of the most entertaining debates of the 2016 election cycle. But when the dust settled, analysts declared the regular season is now over and the playoffs are finally here. But are they right? We'll have more on that in a moment.First, National Journal saying, South Carolina debate crowns a GOP final four that Trump shows he is a front-runner. Rubio and Cruz duke it out and Christie hangs tough. Townhall arguing Trump Cruz and Rubio pulled away from the pocket's last night's debate. And National Review with a similar take. Saying, the Republican primary is increasingly focus on four men. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie.In moments, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will be here. Plus, we'll have in-depth analysis from the life of Chris Stirewalt and Howard Kurtz. Bret Baier, one of my co-moderator at the next debates which happens on January 28th. And then we will speak with Dana Perino about the biggest price of all. The general election in which of these guys could possibly best Hillary Clinton.But we begin tonight with Frank Luntz and his focus group. They got the chance to speak to one of the other candidates that made very big headlines last night. Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Watch this.FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: Senator Ted Cruz.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Senator, what would you want this South Carolina audience to know about you and your candidacy?SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, listen, rather than give a speech you guys have endured a two-and-a-half hour debate. So the last thing you need is filibustering. I do think we saw some good contrast tonight. I do think we had a good opportunity to compare the candidates, compare our records, compare our vision. I thought, by the way, I thought FOX Business did a fabulous job moderating. I haven't always thought that. But this one, I thought there were good questions. You know, what I would like to do rather than yabber at folks is just have a conversation. I mean, I would love to ask you guys, what do you wish had been asked? What do you wish we had been talking about?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want to hear about the health care. How are we going to change that?CRUZ: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How many health care feels and how it fears for the future of our country and health care? How can we change it if you're elected?CRUZ: Listen, health care is fundamental to all of us. I think we need to start by repealing every word of ObamaCare. I think ObamaCare has been a disaster. Excellent.(LAUGHTER)I've never seen those dials. I watched them on TV but never seen them.LUNTZ: There's your score right there. You have an 83-86.CRUZ: But well, listen, once we repeal ObamaCare, nobody thinks we're done. We need common sense health care reform and I think it needs to follow principles of expanding competition, expanding the marketplace, and empowering consumers to make health care decisions in consultation with their doctors.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you say repeal, how easy is that to actually do?CRUZ: So, it's a great question. It is not easy to do. And the sad reality is an awful lot of politicians in Washington, both Democrats and a lot of Republicans, are largely resigned to ObamaCare being a permanent feature of our economy. The only way I think we can repeal it is to make this election a referendum on repealing ObamaCare and also on adopting a simple flat tax. Those are the two big legislative packages that I'm running on. Neither one of those could get done today in Washington.But if we come out of November 2016 with a mandate from the people, you change the rules, you change the dynamics in Washington. There is an old joke that politics is Hollywood for ugly people. Which my wife says I resemble that joke.(LAUGHTER)But, you know, that -- go back to 1981. Think about the last time we beat what I call the Washington cartel. The career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests. The Reagan revolution came from the people and this was this incredible tidal wave that changes Washington. And, you know, in 1981, Tip O'Neill, the democratic speaker of the House, told Ronald Reagan, don't even send your tax plan over. It is dead on arrival. I've got 20 votes to kill it. And Reagan didn't go and try to cajole him and use his Irish wit.Reagan went over their heads. Reagan went to the American people, made the case to the American people. People began lighting up the phones. And tip saw his votes disappearing, 20 became 19, became 18, became 17. And that's how we got tax reform cutting the top rate from 70 percent to 28 percent. That's the only way we actually repeal ObamaCare is that same sort of grassroots movement from the people.LUNTZ: But they are very skeptical. And I want the second row to answer this question. I'm going to start with you. I asked you all what you think of Congress. And none of you like the Republicans there, even though you're all Republican, give the senator a word or phrase to describe what you think of Congress.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do-nothing.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Traitors.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I hate to say this, but with all due respect, it's a big embarrassing joke.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yep.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joke.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Out of touch.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I say traitor except for you. Because I started to read your book.CRUZ: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I say, unprincipled.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Weak.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Inept.LUNTZ: So, it's a way it close out this segment. Why are you different?CRUZ: Well, listen, I agree with everything that's been said. I mean, people are frustrated out of our minds. For one thing we keep winning elections. We won a tidal wave election in 2010. One control of the House. We won another tidal wave election in 2014 and what does leadership do? Funds all of Obama's priorities. It funds ObamaCare, it funds amnesty. It funds the Iran deal, it funds the Syrian refugees. I mean, it's nuts. And the only way to change it, look, is coming from the people. You know, what I tried to do in the Senate from day one is been two things, tell the truth and do what I said I would do.And I promise you, by the way, as bad as you think it is, it's worse. Susan mentioned very kindly that she is reading my book. You know, the whole book is what I call the Washington cartel. It's about telling the inside story. Where what's happening is, leadership in both parties are not listening to the people who elected them. They are listening to the big money in Washington and the only way to change it is going back to the last time we did it. Building grassroots movement. Why all of my time is in the grassroots trying to energize, trying to empower because frankly I can't break the cartel, but you can. That's the only power strong enough. It is the people rising up and forcing the elected officials in both parties to listen to them and be accountable to them.LUNTZ: Do you guys agree to that? Does he sound different to you?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.LUNTZ: You will get a chance to ask him -- wait. Does he sound different to you? Yes or no? Who says he sounds different than the typical member of Congress, raise your hands.Not bad. Who says he doesn't? Two people. What question would you ask Senator Cruz?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The question I would ask you is, what makes you think you can beat Hillary Clinton?LUNTZ: Great question.CRUZ: Great question. It is the single most important question. I think our country is in crisis. If we keep going down this road, we will going to lose our country. My daughters are seven and five. I'm scared for the country they inherit if we don't win. Now what we hear over and over again on TV from all the folks in Washington, is the way we win is to run to the middle. Is to run and basically to run Democrat-like. That's what we're told. And I'm a numbers guy, a data guy. We got to win.If you look at the last election, we won, 2004, you compare it to 2008 and `12, the single biggest difference is the millions of conservatives who showed up in '04, who stayed home in '08 and stayed home in bigger numbers in '12. And they fall basically in two categories. Evangelical Christians and Reagan Democrats, blue collar working class, I think the number one issue if we were going to win in 2016, is how do you bring those millions of conservatives back to the polls? And I'll tell you, Heidi and I before we launched the campaign, I mean, we spent a lot of months in prayer thinking about it.You don't lightly throw a young family with two little girls into the insanity of a presidential race. And the biggest factor that led us to go forward is that I look at the other candidates, people who I like and respect, I don't see any other candidates who I think are likely to energize and mobilize and inspire those millions of conservatives that have been staying home and to bring together that old Reagan coalition. And the reason I decided to run is that I think based on the record I've built of standing and fighting for conservative principles over and over again that I'm in the best position to bring the evangelicals back, to bring the Reagan Democrats back, to reassemble that Reagan coalition and that's the only way I believe we win.LUNTZ: How many of you think, if it is Ted Cruz versus Hillary Clinton, how many of you think Ted Cruz wins?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He better.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No question.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: How about that?Joining me now, Chris Stirewalt, our FOX News digital politics editor and Howie Kurtz, host of ""MediaBuzz"" right here on FNC. It's pretty extraordinary to see that exchange moments after he was up on that stage, and it does speak to Ted Cruz's gift of, you know, being able to articulate his positions and where he stands so well. Let me start with that last piece, Stirewalt though. The piece about the millions of conservatives who stayed at home. I've read a lot of pieces saying that is a myth and that is not true and that the way the Republicans actually have to win this year, and you tell me, this is just what I've read from smart people, is to get -- is to peel off some of the Obama coalition.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, first, I like how they ask, do you think you could beat Hillary Clinton when he was standing right there. What the heck were they going to say? No, this guy is a loser. Get him out of here. They are both right. Ted Cruz is right is that what we are talking right here are white males essentially in the upper Midwest. We're talking about Ohio. Pennsylvania. Wisconsin. We're talking about those voters. They underperform.They underperform 2012 there. Those folks are not the Obama coalition. And Republicans expected them to turn out and they were not there. That having been said, that ain't going to feed the bulldog. Republicans needs to be able to do both things at once. They need to walk and chew gum. They need to get their coalition strengthened and revitalized but simultaneously be able to do well with, yes Hispanic voters, yes, Asian voters, yes younger voters. But first and foremost, what do they have to do? They have to succeed with female voters --KELLY: Women.STIREWALT: -- and especially female voters who have college degrees and are more affluent.KELLY: Uh-hm. Howie, do you agree before we went to that segment with the headlines that this is now a four-man race?HOWARD KURTZ, ""MEDIA BUZZ"" HOST: No. I think it is a two-person race with Rubio and Christie having had good -- at the moment.KELLY: Cruz and Trump you're saying?KURTZ: And Ted and Trump. Yes. But here is the thing, I mean, Ted is a good talker. As we saw right there. And he stood up to Trump. And that helped him. But it remains to be seen whether the Texas debate champion is built for the kind of New York Street fighting he needs for Trump. And speaking of New York, you know, we all in this business Megyn, we score who scored who landed the punch, who deflected the karate chop. From talking to civilians and listening to the media echo chamber, I think that that exchange that we say Trump won over New York values, when he invoked the heartbreak and the bravery of 9/11 may have been more than just winning the moment. In talking to civilians as I say, I think a guy who's known for a bombast and insults was able to project a more compassionate site in a way that could resonate beyond just a few news cycles.KELLY: Uh-hm. Chris, last night, people were saying, Rich Lowry was suggesting, if Trump wins Iowa and New Hampshire, he runs the table. And that's it. Today, there were some push back on claims like that by people like Charlie Cook saying, hold on. There is a whole lot more delegates that come after those initial states. And when we get to March, that's where we get into the winner take all and suggesting it is not really going to be done after Iowa and New Hampshire. Your thoughts.STIREWALT: When it comes to picking a president, picking a nominee, you eat like a cowboy. Cowboy's only got one dish. So, he can only eat one thing at a time.KELLY: Beans.STIREWALT: Usually beans. That's Mel Brooks. But you only can have one, and through the month of February, you can only have one election at a time. So how you do in Iowa affects how do you in New Hampshire. Which affects how do you in South Carolina. Which affects how you do in Nevada. Which then talks about going into March where you get two big days plus a Michigan primary. There's a lot of interconnectedness. There's a lot of inner dependency here. So, here is what I would say, to anybody who says, well, you win there, she wins that, you run the table, it's over. Yes. Or no. We don't know this cycle. We don't know what it is like to have a person with a hundred percent name ID who is creating absolute snap crackle pop in the electorate like Donald Trump is.KELLY: Uh-hm.STIREWALT: But in both directions. We don't know how this is going to pan out. So, we would be fools to sit here --KELLY: Go ahead, Howie.KURTZ: I would just say this. If Ted Cruz doesn't get Iowa after getting expectations so high, he will miss his best chance to slow down the Trump express.KELLY: Uh-hm.KURTZ: And by the way, Washington Post top political writer has a story today with the headlines, can Donald Trump actually be the Republican nominee. And I would say, can it actually be after all these months of Trump being dominants that we are still asking that question. Of course he can. Whether he will be stopped is another question.KELLY: Great to see you both. Thank you.STIREWALT: You bet.KURTZ: Thank you.KELLY: Long night for them. And I appreciate them staying out and doing this.Well, as we mentioned, one of the men who finds himself in the so-called final four after last night's debate will join us in moments. We will ask Governor Chris Christie about the controversy that continues to dog him as he tries to defend his record.Plus, would you vote for a candidate you like even if you believed they could not beat Hillary Clinton? Dana Perino is just ahead on how that question could start changing this race.And then, it's the Powerball winner who wasn't. Horrifying new details on how one poor nurse with the terrible, terrible son, went from thinking that she won the billion dollars to learning it appears to have been a cruel prank.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I said he supported Sonia Sotomayor, who is one of the most liberal justices on the Supreme Court because he supported her nomination. He denies it. This is a quote, politicker New Jersey on July 17th, 2009, this is a quote. I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was Senator Marco Rubio just hours ago reacting to his clash with Governor Chris Christie at the FOX Business Network debate last night. Mr. Rubio and Christie found themselves in a sort of mini debate over Governor Christie's record on everything from the Supreme Court as you heard there, to gun control and even common core. Governor Christie joins us in a moment to respond.But first Trace Gallagher is here with how the fact checkers scored this. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, PolitiFact says the Governor Christie's claim that he did not support Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor is flat out false. We found out that he certainly did call her nomination and historic moment that should make the Latino community and all-Americans proud but it is also clear that she would not have been at the top of Chris Christie's list. Quote, ""While Judge Sotomayor would not have been my choice President Obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the Supreme Court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability, competence and ability.""Christie also claims he never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood but in a New Jersey star Ledger Article from September of `94, Christie was quoted saying, I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency to find private donations."" Christie is now convinced he was misquoted. The Washington Post says, he was either misleading voters in `94 or is doing so now. As for Christie supporting common core educational standards, turns out he did before he didn't. He said quote, ""This is one of those areas where I've agreed more with the President than not.""But last year, he said, again quoting, ""It's been five years since common core was adopted. Truth is, it's not working."" Christie also claims common core has been eliminated in New Jersey and while it has been substantially cut back, it has not yet been eliminated. When it comes to gun control, Chris Christie has used his experience as a federal prosecutor to argue both sides. In 2009, the Washington Post wrote that as a federal prosecutor, Christie saw that a certain gun control measures can help take illegal guns away without infringing on second amendment rights. Now he's become more pro-gun rights saying, quoting, ""The biggest reason I changed my mind was my seven years as a federal prosecutor"" -- Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you.Joining us now, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican candidate for president. Governor, good to see you. Thanks for being here.So, what do you make of these? Let's just tick through them quickly. Because I want to give you the chance to respond. On Sotomayor, you tell me, you seemed to be saying, I didn't want her, she wasn't my choice. But you did ultimately throw your support behind her. So when Rubio said you supported her, what is wrong about that?GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is wrong. Because what I said was, she wasn't my kind of judge. She would not have been my choice. And she is not somebody that would have wanted on the bench. But what I did say afterwards Megyn was that, she deserved an up or down vote. And people should give her an up or down vote the same way I demanded that they give Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts in an up or down vote.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But you said specifically, I support her appointment to the Supreme Court. I support her. You called it a historic moment. An inspiring success story that should not only make the Latino community proud but all- Americans.CHRISTIE: It is an inspiring success story for the Latino community. It doesn't mean I would have appointed her to the Supreme Court. I clearly said that I didn't. I wouldn't have supported her to the Supreme Court.KELLY: OK.CHRISTIE: So, the fact is though, Megyn, this is the stuff that you do if you're United States senator, and this is why nothing gets done down there. Because you take people's words out of context. You don't give it a complete meaning. And then you create gridlock. I mean, that's what Marco has been very good at, when he showed up for work.KELLY: He is trying to paint you as a guy who is pretty liberal and not as conservative as he is. And so, that's why he is taking off his example. Let's talk about the Planned Parenthood one.CHRISTIE: Megyn, wait a second, Megyn. Before -- Megyn --KELLY: Go ahead.CHRISTIE: Megyn, before we go on, I mean, it is kind of funny that the guy who is the author of the gang of eight amnesty bill, he coauthored it with Chuck Schumer, that granted amnesty, to people who are here illegally, is now saying that someone else is not a conservative. And as soon as the heat got turned up there, he turned tail and ran.KELLY: But now I want to tick through these with you. Because I know you can defend your record --CHRISTIE: Sure.KELLY: So, I would love to hear your defense. The Planned Parenthood thing is in black and white. The Washington Post says, you said it, you say I was misquoted. It is a pretty detailed explanation of, you didn't want public funds going to Planned Parenthood. That is what you were trying to tell them.CHRISTIE: Correct. Yes.KELLY: But in making that case, they say, you got specific and said, look, I support them privately with my personal contributions. That should be the goal of any agency to find private donations. They completely busted that up? They got that totally wrong? Did you dispute it at the time?CHRISTIE: No. Here is how they got it wrong, Megyn. What I said was, that organizations like that should be supported with private funds. And I do that. Not that organization. That organizations like that should not be getting government funding. And that's how they messed up the quote.KELLY: How about the gun?CHRISTIE: And I don't hold it against him. Because he works for me now.KELLY: Because last time, last night on the guns, you touted the fact that you once proposed a ban that you once vetoed a bill that would have banned future sales of this .50 caliber rifle. But isn't it true that you were the one who first proposed that ban on the .50 caliber rifle? Before you were against it, you were the one proposing it?CHRISTIE: No, it was a commission that I put together, it was a group of folks who made recommendations to me. I look forward at all those recommendations, and then the legislature came back and what they wanted to do was not only ban future sales, they wanted to confiscate guns that have already been purchased and I said, you know, this bill just goes too far and I vetoed it.KELLY: But you were the one who proposed a ban on the .50 caliber rifle, right?CHRISTIE: Megyn, a group of people who are putting forward advice to me on a whole range of gun control and gun related bills put that forward. It was forwarded out of the governor's office. And the legislature did not do what we asked them to do. Here is the problem with Senator Rubio. Last night he rattled off a bunch of things that his awful research guys have given him. Then when I started answering back, he didn't answer back last night, when I was on the stage. He waits until he gets to New Hampshire. And you'll notice, look at the split screen, when I'm talking to him, he can't even look at me.He cannot even look at me after making those charges. And so, you know, the fact is that Marco has a lot of guts when I'm not standing next to him. But last night when I'm standing next to him, he would not have brought it up if Neil Cavuto would not have brought it up himself in the question. And then when I answered it and he has the opportunity, he could have said right back to me, no, Governor you're wrong, those defenses are wrong. He certainly argued back and forth enough with Ted Cruz last night. Why didn't he take a look at me and tell me that I wasn't telling the truth when I was saying, he was being disingenuous. Because he didn't have the guts to do it. Because he knows that he is twisting the facts like any senator does. They twist the facts. Filibuster. And he didn't, you know, he couldn't justify his position.KELLY: Maybe he was embarrassed that you guys were wearing the same outfit. It's like, that's how, you know, women do it at a party. Just try not to make eye contact. It's awkward.(LAUGHTER)Governor. Thank you for doing this.CHRISTIE: Well, you know, I always send Marco my tie choice beforehand. And if he disregards it, then that's up to him.KELLY: That's right. That's on him. All the best.CHRISTIE: On him, Megyn.KELLY: See you soon.CHRISTIE: Thank you.KELLY: It is awkward, right? That's why I have to wear something like this with a collar blocking. Because you never know what's going to happen.So now you have heard from Governor Christie. You heard from Senator Cruz. What about the rest of the field?Bret Baier is here next with his takeaway from the showdown in South Carolina and what it means for the next debate hosted by FNC on January 28.Plus, after a son pulled a billion dollar Powerball prank on his mother, her boss steps in to try to make it right. A story you have to see straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander-in-chief of the United States. Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander-in-chief. And someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was Florida Senator Marco Rubio last night scoring points on democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton with the reference to both her e- mail scandal and to the ongoing questions over how she handled Benghazi and the terror attack that happened there September 11th, 2012.Joining me now, host of ""Special Report"" and one of my co-moderators in the upcoming FOX News debate Bret Baier. So, Bret, we are lucky, because we get the last crack at these guys before the actual voting begins and with the Iowa caucuses. And the next debate is January 28, just in case people aren't aware.BRET BAIER, ""SPECIAL REPORT"" ANCHOR: It's going to be fun.KELLY: It's going to be really fun. We're getting ready with our questions now. So, those are sort of the twin issues. He went to the place that hurts for Hillary, e-mails and Benghazi. Let's just talk about that because you have done a lot of work on Benghazi, did an hour-long special, it was very compelling. And now the movie has come out ""13 Hours,"" do you think that's going to resurrect as an issue? I mean, how big an issue in this race?BAIER: Yes. Listen, Megyn, I think you're hearing more and more candidates raise it. I think you had Donald Trump rent out a theater in Des Moines so people could see the movie ""13 Hours"" as part of a, you know, a voter ploy, I think. Also you know, you heard the President mentioned Benghazi in the State of the Union. From a pop culture standpoint, the Benghazi story just by this movie will reach more people. It won't be as tough to understand in that format. So, a lot of people will likely see that movie.Plus you have the Benghazi Committee that eventually will come out with a report with details. New details we're told that will paint the different picture behind the scenes. So I think it will factor in, if not now then in the general election.KELLY: What do you make of the predictions we heard in the first segment? Howie Kurtz is saying he thinks it's a two-man race now. He thinks it is Trump, Cruz and you could say good bye to everybody else.BAIER: I think two-man race is a little tough to jump there. A lot can happen, as you know, in a short period of time. A lot depends on the ground game. And we don't know until you get to the first vote.KELLY: Don't they decide late in Iowa? Like history shows they decide pretty late, right before the contest.BAIER: Exactly. And some of the people -- I was just there talking to a number of caucus goers, and they told me that they were leaning one way but they decided in the last two weeks, last cycle. Sometimes in the last week, so you know who shows up in the firehouse in the middle of winter is different than some poll answering a telephone call.KELLY: And the ground game. We heard so much about the ground game in Iowa. Apparently, Ted Cruz is very organized in this respect. Trump is not. But Trump's response is you've got -- you know 6,000 people who come to one of my rallies. You're telling me they're not going to show up on voting day? Even if they don't have a history of doing it, he doesn't believe they're not going to do it this time.BAIER: That is a fair point. There's a lot of passion on the Trump side. But also in these Trump rallies, there are people with the campaigns saying don't forget you have to register as a Republican. You know there are a lot of independents and Democrats who come out to see Trump and support Trump. That factors in New Hampshire because it is an open primary. In Iowa you have to be registered Republican.KELLY: What do you think our challenge is with less than two weeks to go until our next debate?BAIER: You know it is all about timing. It is all about spinning struggling plates.KELLY: I thought that wouldn't happen this time.BAIER: No, Neil and Maria I think did a great job with all of the exchanges.KELLY: Agreed.BAIER: I this we will try to get to substance but also let it breath and let them talk about the issues that are key on the trail.KELLY: Going to be exciting. If you could only hear the debates we have behind the scenes. First we beat up on each other. Brett and Chris and I, and then we go out there...BAIER: Then polish them down.KELLY: Yes. Brett's always talking about the dismount. Improve on the dismount of your question.BAIER: Always the dismount.KELLY: And I think their questions are too wordy, great to see you, Brett.BAIER: Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY: Well, the Republican primary is one thing, but the general election is something else altogether. Who now has a realistic shot at winning at all and who doesn't? Dana Perino is here with new polling on the biggest question of all, just ahead. And Frank Luntz and our focus group are back with the issues that made them mad as hell. See how that may play out in early voting.FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: How many of you are mad as hell -- everybody.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Even before the first votes are cast, this is shaping up to be an election for the history books, as so-called nontraditional candidates find themselves driving the process, and trampling all over early predictions. So what is driving the voters who are supporting those candidates? Well, Frank Luntz put that question to the focus group. Here he is with more.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LUNTZ: More than half of them will tell you they are mad as hell and not going to take it any more. Let's find out what our South Carolinian voters think. How many of you are mad as hell -- everybody. What are you so angry at?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right now we are paying as much for refugees and immigrants in this country as we are paying for our V.A. veterans care right now, $168 billion a year.LUNTZ: Are you that mad?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am mad.LUNTZ: Over what?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our health care is going straight down the toilet. We can't convince any doctors to treat patients. Our military is not being supported. And our borders are open.LUNTZ: This anger that people feel, it's not productive, is it?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Health care. I got laid off because of ObamaCare. And it's not fair, people losing jobs, people losing money. And people aren't -- I got to buy health care now and it is $350 a month. I can't afford that.LUNTZ: Some people have been protected by it. Some people now have health care available. Why does that make you so angry?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What bothers me the most in the country is that you can't even speak the truth anymore or else you will be called a racist or bigot or any other...LUNTZ: So political correctness, does that bother you?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It bothers me very much.LUNTZ: Because?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because I have a right to my opinion without being labeled something. It is ridiculous. It has.LUNTZ: You're calling it discrimination. How? Explain that.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, because anyone who says anything has to watch everything they say, and you can't label a spade a spade. And everyone is afraid to talk.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What it really boils down for me is the cultural change. I could have never imagined that in eight years of my country I could have seen such a huge cultural change.LUNTZ: What do you mean by that?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: An overwhelming umbrella of everything. It goes to how we treat our veterans, it goes to how we treat our older people, and it is a cultural change. How we are educating our children or not educating our children. How we treat one another. We have a majority of Republicans in a congress and we can't get anything done. They are all voting with the Democrats.LUNTZ: Who is mad at congress? You're Republicans. It's a Republican leadership.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All of them lie.LUNTZ: Republicans in congress?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They have lied to us. They can't get anything done. They are lying because they say they will defeat Obamacare. They've done nothing. They say they will protect social security...LUNTZ: What do you want from them?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want them to stop lying. Tell the truth.LUNTZ: I want to understand what's going on with Republicans in congress because they've got the house and senate.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want my government back. I want my government back that is supposed to be a citizen legislature, not supposed to be a political class that has taken over and it is us versus them.LUNTZ: What do you want congress to do? They have a Democratic President.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They have been timid, weak. Grow a backbone. Follow the constitution. Change it.LUNTZ: You would impeach Barack Obama? How many of you -- seriously? How many of you by show of hands would impeach Barack Obama? Come on. Are you for real?(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He has broken so many laws that it is ridiculous that he is still in office.LUNTZ: You would impeach Barack Obama?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Executive overreach.LUNTZ: That's impeachable?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not impeachable but it shouldn't...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nobody should be above the law, including the President of the United States.LUNTZ: How many people believe in term limits for members of congress?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.LUNTZ: How many if you could, would throw every member of congress out and every incumbent and start over? That's just about all of you. In they are watching in Washington, you're in big, big trouble.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Coming up, meet the Powerball winner who wasn't. And what is turning out to be a billion dollar prank.Up next after this break, Dana Perino on the effort to win the ultimate prize, the White House.LUNTZ: How many of you by show of hands think at least one of them should drop out? Raise your hands.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LUNTZ: How many of you by show of hands think at least one of them should drop out? Raise your hands. Ok, here we go. I am going to countdown and tell the American people which candidate should be gone after tonight, ready, three, two, one...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Christie.KELLY: One thing is absolutely clear. Frank Luntz's focus group believes someone needs to drop out of this White House race. Who should it be? That's less clear. Dana Perino is co-host of ""The Five"" and former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, and author of the book ""And the Good News Is,"" good to see you.DANA PERINO, ""THE FIV""E CO-HOST: Yes, I just got back from Charleston.KELLY: I know. You were there on a whirlwind tour.PERINO: Yes. I haven't had a chance to be there this year so I did get a feel for the crowd.KELLY: Obviously, Trump did very well. Cruz did very well. The question is, now that we seen to have the lanes defined, Trump and Cruz battling it out for true conservative. Or I don't know whether Trump is a true conservative in most people's view, but the alternate lane, versus Rubio and Christie. What should the American electorate think about when it comes to electability?PERINO: One thing that comes from the discussion of the debate, which was able to meet the goal, they set out for. I would say that one is Rubio. He said himself aside. If you say who the top three are, you take three dresses into the dressing room to try on like one, two, and three. I would say Trump, Cruz and Rubio at this point.KELLY: Does one of these make us look fat?PERINO: That's the question -- when you put it on in front of the three- way mirror. I always have to have everything hemmed.KELLY: Do you think Rubio's got that lane secured? So is it a three-man race or four-man race?PERINO: I think Christie could surprise and do well in New Hampshire. Can he do that? I don't know. He hired some people. It is different groups leading up to it. One of the most important groups we've talked about on your show is women. And single women will make up 25 percent of the electorate in 2016.KELLY: General electorate.PERINO: General electorate. Why is that important? Because President Obama won women by 10 percent point, 55 to 44 percent in the general election, so if you look at something like Trump and Cruz they don't do that well with women. They have some room to grow, I would say. Rubio does a little bit better with women and that's an important one for him. And another one to look out though of course is Hispanics. If you look the match-up with Clintons and Hispanics, across the board, they are pretty good.KELLY: What do you mean pretty good?PERINO: For Clinton they are good. In terms of Latinos for Clinton, versus Trump 69 percent to 27 percent, that's a huge difference.KELLY: Isn't that what it wound up being for Romney?PERINO: It is better for Clinton than even for Obama when it comes to Romney, because 43, President George W. Bush won 44 percent of Hispanics in 2004.KELLY: Is that even possible?PERINO: Romney won 27 percent. It might not be possible. But if they don't try they won't be close to winning a general election because of demographic changes. It was estimated that Romney needed to win at least 35 percent of Hispanic vote to even hope to win general election...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Trump, he doesn't do very well with women in the general electorate. He doesn't do well with Hispanics in the general electorate. But some say he's going to peel off some Democrats, unlike other candidates. He's such a populist on certain issues, especially economic issues that he's going to pull off more Democrats than the other ways would.PERINO: That is possibly true. I met a woman last night in the hall who said do you want to talk to a former Democrat who became a Republican because I am supporting Trump? I said sure. That might be one of the ways Obama beat Clinton, brought new voters to the table. If Trump can bring new voters, he can have a shot.KELLY: Fascinating, 17 days to go until the first caucuses in the country in Iowa. And we'll be there, Dana, great to see you.PERINO: Thanks.KELLY: There have been plenty of Powerball stories this week. But this will make you feel -- you will -- you will cry in your soup. Stay tuned for that.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: When a long-time nursing home employee learned she may have won it all in this week's Powerball, her colleagues and even her bosses suggested she could not be more deserving. But in one of the most brutal, evil, awful twists we have seen this week, not only did this woman not win, she may have been pranked by a member of her own family. Trace Gallagher has more from the west coast newsroom, Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER: Megyn, the 62-year-old nurse got the Powerball ticket from her boss, who bought 18,000 tickets for all of his employees and residents at his many senior care facilities. On the night of the drawing, the nurse's son sent her a cell phone picture of what he said was her winning ticket. The nurse kept working, but as word got out, the nursing home started celebrating. Then the whole party came crashing down when lottery officials got skeptical and anonymous sources started knocking down the claims.Turns out, the woman was pranked by her son, who thought it would be amusing to tell his mom that she was $528 million richer, funny, right? Well, not so much for the rest of the nurse's family who called the prank embarrassing. The owner of the nursing home called it despicable, but has now said he's offering a nice consolation prize. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Someone said this is a joke I would probably want you to let her know that I am going to get her an all-paid vacation wherever she wants to go. Because this is -- this is one of those bad jokes.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  What is next in this wild presidential race after Donald Trump comes out swinging following Hillary Clinton's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention?  Hi, everybody.  Welcome.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  This is ""Sunday Morning Futures.""Trump taking the weekend off from campaigning, but that is not stopping him from shaking things up in this election.  Trump's son Eric Trump will join me in just a few moments.  Plus, Trump getting a lot of pushback for his comments about the parents of the Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq who spoke at the DNC.  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise on whether it's hurting efforts to unify the Republican Party.Also, will Hillary Clinton get a similar bump in the polls that Donald Trump saw after his convention speech?  Pollster Frank Luntz is with is with his predictions as we look ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(MUSIC)BARTIROMO:  Hillary Clinton formally accepting the Democratic nomination for president this past week.  But many are saying Donald Trump may have stolen the spotlight.  Since Clinton, President Obama, Vice President Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg focused their speeches on attacking Trump.  Joining me now to react is Eric Trump.  He's the executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the Trump Organization and the son of Donald Trump.  Good to see you, Eric.ERIC TRUMP, SON OF DONALD TRUMP:  Always great being with you.  BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.What a week.  A lot of attacks.  A lot of vitriol against your father.  What is your reaction to what we heard?TRUMP:  First of all, they were all career politicians.  I was laughing last night.  I mean, it's career politicians after career politician, right?  I mean, this is the problem in the country.  It's people who have been in the same spot, who have tried the same things over and over.  I mean, if you look at Hillary, when she spoke a couple of nights ago, she didn't even mention the real problems, right?  She never once mentioned ISIS.  She didn't mention radical Islamic terrorism.  You're having people going to clubs in Orlando, you're having people shoot up streets, you're having people in trucks in Nice mow down -- I mean, the attacks on -- couple days ago, you had a priest in France who's beheaded in his own church.  And she didn't even mention ISIS.  She didn't mention the trade imbalance last month that we had that was $63 billion, $63 billion.  The $19 trillion worth of national debt that we have.  I mean, these are the real problems that are plaguing this country.  You know, not a single one was mention.  Yet, you know, she just sat there and tried to demonize my father.  It's just -- it's a really interesting tactic and I don't think it's going to work.BARTIROMO:  I was surprised that the issue did not come up.  I did see a lot of conversation about that on social media.  People were upset.  But they also want more specifics from Donald Trump.  They want to know what your father's plan is.  Do you think we're going to get more substance and more specifics in terms of how to defeat ISIS from your side?  TRUMP:  Yes, listen, there's no question about it.  I think he spent a lot of time talking about it.  I think -- first of all, the other side's not even willing to talk about it.  You've got to start there.  You've got to actually acknowledge the problem.I think he has been pretty forceful with it.  Starting with locking down our borders, starting by, you know, going in, actually doing real background checks on the people who are coming into this nation, telling the whole world he's not going to allow hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees that we can vet, you know, into this country.And, you know, and then also giving the same parallel and going back to Germany and you see the problems that Germany's having, right, where they're letting, you know, millions of refugees into that country, and then you see all these problems that are popping up all over the place, which is really -- you know, almost why the country's in a state of anarchy lately because of this.So, I actually think he has been pretty specific on some of the things he's going to do.  We get a lot more specific as we reach November.  BARTIROMO:  Let me ask about your father's response to a lot of this, because, obviously, he was a big topic of conversation this past week at the Democratic Convention.  One of the reasons is the press conference he gave where he said, look, Russia, let's find those 30,000 e-mails that Hillary Clinton deleted.  You know, right after that, the other side pounced, basically saying that's irresponsible.  That's dangerous to invite Russia to do perhaps even more hacking.  TRUMP:  Isn't that amazing that they say that's irresponsible, that's dangerous, when all those 33,000 e-mails were supposed to be about yoga and the hair stylists and the personal --BARTIROMO:  But is it responsible to get -- to ask Russia out and out to come and hack America?TRUMP:  First of all, I think it was kind of tongue in cheek to what he said, and I think it was pretty sarcastic.BARTIROMO:  He said it was sarcastic.TRUMP:  Second of all, I think it's really interesting.  The first time you've ever heard President Obama talk about cybersecurity, at least that I've heard President Obama talked about security was when the DNC gets hacked.  Companies like ours, every single hotel company in the world, every major corporation, every single day, people from around the world, whether it'd be Russia, whether it'd be China, so many perpetrators, are breaking into companies trying to steal personal information.  BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  TRUMP:  Trying to steal credit card information, right?  Trying to steal trade secrets, intellectual property.  It costs our nation trillions and trillions of dollars a year.  And, you know, the first time that President Obama talks about cybersecurity was when the DNC gets hacked.  And quite frankly, he's totally embarrassed because so many of the things in the DNC e-mails were totally, totally, totally inappropriate.I mean, one of those things Maria was about her own country, right?  Let's go put fake job postings on Craigslist, pretending we're the Trump organization, soliciting, you know, young women who are very good looking, let's see if we can embarrass.  I mean, these are sick people.  To think about that, these are sick people.BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing.  I mean, is your father missing an opportunity to stay on message and stick to the issue?  Because actually, the other side was very affected in turning this into a Russia story, but the actual story was that the Democrats basically -- Bernie never had a shot and they made it so difficult for Bernie Sanders and his supporters to have any ground.  And yet, your father may have fallen for it.  TRUMP:  Listen, I feel for Bernie.  I know how hard this process is, having lived it for the last, you know, a year.  I mean, it's the most grueling, hard process.  You know, say what you will, but Bernie believed.  He's like my father in that way.  They may be on opposite sides of the aisle, but Bernie believed.  And to go in there and you see Debbie Wasserman Schultz who had totally rigged it for Hillary.  They've been best friends.  You look at the relationship with Kaine and everything else to the DNC.  It was totally rigged system.  Bernie didn't have a shot.  BARTIROMO:  I got to ask you about his comments on NATO, as well as an economy that really once again Friday, we saw a horrible GDP number.  But in terms of NATO, people are wondering, you know, he said, look, all NATO countries have to pay their fair share.  People are questioning the ""or else"".  Are we going to be dissolving our NATO relationship?  What is he trying to say with regard to NATO?  TRUMP:  I think he's been very clear.  Of the 28 countries in NATO, only five pay their way.  Five pay their way.So, the U.S. taxpayer is paying a disproportional burden of NATO. In fact, the vast majority of NATO, right?  So, I mean, we become the world's police force and our tax dollars pay for that.  At the same time, our national deficit is $19 trillion and climbing quickly.  We have roads that are falling part, we have schools that are falling apart.  I mean, you and I walked through La Guardia probably every single week, right?  I mean, you'll have TSA screening machines and literally a tarp above them with a tube going into a bucket because our roofs are leaking and our major infrastructure in our biggest cities in this nation.  It's a disgrace.  My father's whole point with NATO is everybody's got to pay.  If they want that protection, you have to pay for that protection.  I mean, you can't have a one-way straight where you have this allegiance of 28 people but only five of those countries are actually paying their way.  That's just not fair.BARTIROMO:  On the economy, we know Donald Trump's tax plan includes a 15 percent corporate tax rate which obviously would be really positive for businesses who want a hire and put that money back to work.  But the trade part of his economic plan is being questioned.  Are we going to see increasing tariffs or tariffs on the countries that we have been enjoying free trade with?  Isn't that going to make the economy which is growing at a snail's pace, doesn't that make things more difficult?  TRUMP:  He wants to bring jobs back to this country, right?  He wants to bring jobs back to this country.  Now, some will argue, OK, well, a product might be 2 cents more, but the difference is people will be able to afford to buy them because they'll have jobs.  Between 2000 and 2015, I've talked about this point all the time, we've lost one-third of our manufacturing in this country.  I mean, think about it, one-third of our jobs have left this country, manufacturing jobs have left this country.  They've gone to China, they've gone to Mexico, they've gone to other places.  I mentioned earlier, right, we had a $63 billion trade imbalance last month.  The month of June, we had $63 billion trade imbalance.  We're getting ripped off by the entire world.  I mean, our trade deficit with China is almost $500 billion.  BARTIROMO:  Does that mean tariff -- I mean, if you're going to raise tariffs, if you're going to put new tariffs in place, doesn't that make products more expensive?  TRUMP:  I don't think he wants to put new tariffs.  I think he's willing to if he has to.  BARTIROMO:  Eric, final question here, what moment in the sun you had.  A lot of people, you know, really praised you and your brothers and sisters for really doing well for your father at the Republican National Convention.  How was it for you getting up to that podium and speaking to tens of millions of people?TRUMP:  It was surreal.  First of all, I build hotels for a living, right? I mean, this is -- you know, politics is obviously a new game for us.  But it was amazing.  To see the patriotism in that room, to see American flags, to see the people going crazy.  It was a lot of fun.  And more importantly, to speak on behalf of somebody you love tremendously, and there's no one in the world who knows my father better than I do, and he would do an amazing job.  I say this time and time again.  He'll do such an amazing job.  And so, if I can contribute in my small way to going out there and kind of reinforce the man he is and the father he's been, you know, it was an honor to be on that stage.  BARTIROMO:  How did Hillary Clinton do?  TRUMP:  Listen, I think -- I think she tried to demonize my father.  I think her whole speech last night was trying to demonize my father and this kind of ironic, even her checkered past.  I mean, we don't need a third term of Obama.  We don't need more national debt.  We need more of the problems that we had and we don't need more public corruption.  We need somebody to go in and blow up Washington, D.C., and, you know, you need an outsider to do it.  I mean, you really need somebody that stops the games within the Beltway, because it's -- you know, I've been exposed to it over the last 12 months like I never saw before when I was kind of, you know, not part of this process.  It is disgusting.  I mean, honestly, our political system is just -- it's broken in ways that I never -- I could have never imagined.  BARTIROMO:  It's pretty extraordinary.  Eric Trump, great to see you.  TRUMP:  Great being with you, Maria.BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  TRUMP:  Always, great.BARTIROMO:  Eric Trump.  Hillary Clinton making a plea for unity at the convention meanwhile as she urged the Democrats to come together after a bruising primary season.  Did it work?  I will ask Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy, next.  You can follow me on Twitter.  What do you want to hear from Dan Malloy?   @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures, let us know.  Stay with us.  We're looking ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Hillary Clinton basking in the glow of her historical moment at the Democratic National Convention this past week in Philadelphia.  The nominee pushing for party unity while also turning her fire on her Republican opponent as she accepted that nomination.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Our country's motto is e pluribus unum, out of many, we are one.Will we stay true to that motto?  Well, we heard Donald Trump's last week at his convention.  He wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO:  And joining me right now to talk about it is Clinton supporter, Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy.  He's also chair of the Democratic Governors Association and the DNC platform committee.  Sir, good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for joining us.  GOV. DAN MALLOY, D-CONNECTICUT:  It's good to be with you again.  BARTIROMO:  So, you were -- had this starring role at the convention last week, but before we get to that, you come home to storm clouds of your own. A federal probe into campaign funds, the latest headache for you.  Did you misappropriate funds when you were running for reelection sir?  MALLOY:  Well, first of all, it's an election examination of fundraising and expenditures.  I'm quite confident that it will be resolved and we go forward from there.  BARTIROMO:  So, did you use funds from state actors for your own campaign? That's the charge.  MALLOY:  No, whatever was done was done legally.  Whatever money was raised, was raised legally.  And I'm sure that that's the outcome of the investigation.  BARTIROMO:  Governor, when you were out there last week in Philadelphia trying to push forward party unity and then you get faced with this situation where all of these e-mails are dumped and Debbie Wasserman Schultz is pushed out, how do you balance it, how do you bring people together, knowing that those e-mails told a story that the whole thing was rigged and Bernie never had a shot?  MALLOY:  They don't tell that story quite frankly.  Everyone's entitled to have your own opinion, even if you work for an organization.  And I think what you're talking about is people expressing their own opinion, but not the opinion of the organization.  And point of fact, in a number of those memos, the person was expressing their own point of view and saying the boss disagrees.  The boss was Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  That's who they were referring to.  You know, listen, I think that what the big question here is, is why would Donald Trump ask the foreign governments to spy on former secretary of state.  Isn't this a little bit outside the boundaries of what is reasonable?  This is a guy who tweets his way or wants to tweet his way to the presidency, but yet calls on other people to do illegal things to candidates for president, beyond the pale.  BARTIROMO:  But it is a fair question.  You just heard Eric Trump answer that.  He said that with sarcasm.  And he did -- wasn't actually asking Russians to hack America.  But, look, put that aside --MALLOY:  Wait, wait.  I got to stop you there.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO:  -- because the content of the email, Governor, we know the contents of the e-mail.  It basically said let's come up with a narrative that Bernie's an atheist and not Jewish.  That will really play well.  I mean, the contents of e-mails are the contents on the e-mails.  This is not about Russia.  This is about the Democratic National Committee getting together with a strategy to make sure debates weren't watched closely, that Bernie didn't have the same opportunities that Hillary Clinton has had.  MALLOY:  That was a long speech.  So, let me just put it this way, I wonder if you've ever expressed your personal opinion in an e-mail to someone.BARTIROMO:  Of course.MALLOY:  Even though you're a newscaster and have to be neutral.  I'm sure you have.  That's what people do.  BARTIROMO:  But I'm not running for president.  I'm not running for president, Governor.  (CROSSTALK)MALLOY:  Eric was on your show -- what's that?  BARTIROMO:  I'm not running for president.  When you're talking about the highest office in the land, people just want to know that the game is straight, that this is all fair.  That it's not rigged, but those e-mails showed us differently.  MALLOY:  No, I don't think they did, quite frankly.  And here, I give you a challenge.BARTIROMO:  OK.MALLOY:  Why doesn't Donald Trump release all of his e-mails for the last year, last two years, or last three years --BARTIROMO:  People are asking him to release a lot of stuff, for sure, including the tax returns.  But let me ask you about policy, Governor, I really -- I think the American people at this point are tired of the name- calling and they want to hear about policy.  What do you believe is going to be Hillary Clinton's most important policy to move the needle on economic growth?  MALLOY:  Listen, I think she's laid out a very aggressive platform, not the least of which is to invest in America, something that the Republicans in the Congress have not permitted to happen.  You had a discussion with Eric about infrastructure.BARTIROMO:  Right.MALLOY:  She has laid out on infrastructure program.  We've talked about corporate tax reform.  We've talked about bringing back foreign profits.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO:  But in doing so, she wants to raise taxes.  MALLOY:  And done so in a level of detail that the Trump people quite frankly can't even wrap their minds around.  BARTIROMO:  As a way to do it, as a way to pay for it, she wants to raise taxes on the highest earners, including small business.  Isn't that one of the policies you've implemented and caused a complete outflow of people leaving Connecticut?  Including large corporations like General Electric, Governor?MALLOY:  You've just said two things that don't go together.  She wants to raise taxes on the richest Americans and small business.  It's not true.  BARTIROMO:  How is it not true, Governor?  She's going to raise taxes to the highest earnings that hit small business.MALLOY:  There is no proposal to raise taxes on small business.  BARTIROMO:  It's included -- you have small businesses that hit the level of income that the highest earners hit.  That's the point.  They're going to get hit just because she's raising taxes on the highest earners.  Then they're not going to create jobs.  That's the whole point.  MALLOY:  Listen, you can't have it both ways.  Are the Kochs small business?  Is that what you're talking about?  BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?MALLOY:  I mean, are the Koch brothers small business?  Is that what you're talking about?  Because they might have companies --BARTIROMO:  I'm not talking about the Koch brothers.  I'm talking about an Uber driver.  I'm talking about the guy down the street that has a delicatessen.  I'm talking about the small business companies in this country that are the job creators.  MALLOY:  You're telling me you've seen a proposal from Democrats to raise taxes on Uber drivers.  BARTIROMO:  Go to the website.MALLOY:  Where?  BARTIROMO:  Go to the website.  Go to Hillary's website.  It's all there A to Z.MALLOY:  I'm on the website all the time.  I think I'm on the website much more frequently than you are.BARTIROMO:  Governor, it's good to have you.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  MALLOY:  Thank you.  BARTIROMO:  Governor Malloy.  Donald Trump facing backlash after he criticizes the Muslim American parents of U.S. soldier who was killed in Iraq.  How Republican leaders are responding to calls that they should denounce their presidential nominee.  We'll take a look at that as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures"", next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The father of a Muslim-American army captain whose son was killed in Iraq is imploring Republicans to take action against their presidential nominee. Khizr Khan denouncing Trump during last week's DNC, saying he, quote, ""consistently smears"" the character of Muslims and accusing Trump of making little sacrifice for our country.  In a statement, a spokesperson for the House Speaker Paul Ryan said the speaker has made clear many times that he rejects this idea and himself has talked about how Muslim Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country.  Joining me right now for more on this is Republican Congressman Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who is also the House Majority Whip.  Congressman, good to see you.  REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA., HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  Good morning, Maria.  Good to be back with you.BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this war of words.  SCALISE:  Well, first, let me express my sympathies to the Khan family for their loss.  You know, obviously any time one of our men and women in uniform pay that ultimate price, our hearts go out to them.  These are heroes helping us in the war against terror.  So, I think we have nothing but the deepest sympathies and my prayers as well to the Khan family.  BARTIROMO:  Yes.And Donald Trump tweeted out, ""Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about radical Islamic terror and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it.""This is -- Trump is separating this situation from what he's trying to do with the borders.  Can he do that?  SCALISE:  Well, I think he's hit on something that most Americans are really concerned about.  That is radical Islamic terrorism is not just a threat to other parts of the world.  It's a threat to the United States. It has come here to our soil.  And Hillary Clinton's policies when she was secretary of state helped create the formation of ISIS, not only the advancement of Russia moving through anywhere Eastern Europe.  You look at Iran.  Hillary Clinton last week double down on this horrible deal with Iran that literally lets Iran have path way to a nuclear weapon.  People understand what's at stake and Donald Trump's made it clear he's going to protect America, he's going to make America strong again, and it's got to happen, because our allies across the world are calling on us to step up, and Hillary Clinton had led policies that have made America weaker.  We've got to reverse these policies.BARTIROMO:  And, of course, the platform of the Republicans has included a wall, a border wall.  Is that enough to show the party and the American people, the independents out there, that the party is together and they're getting behind Donald Trump?  We were all at the Republican National Convention two weeks ago, it was obvious that there are certain people who will not get on board.  The Bushes were not there.  Ted Cruz would not endorse, the governor of Ohio.  SCALISE:  Well, look, a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters were literally turning their back on Hillary Clinton as she was speaking, disgracefully, there were a lot of people in the room at the Democratic convention who wouldn't even applaud when they talked about our service men and women.  So, I think there's other issues there.  I never heard Hillary Clinton denouncing that.  But Donald Trump has said he's going to secure our borders.  It's something that President Obama and Hillary Clinton haven't done.  In fact, Hillary Clinton wants to bring in thousands of Syrian refugees who ISIS has said their going to infiltrate.  Everybody knows, including the FBI said they can't even vet these people coming into the United States.  We've got to secure our borders, strengthen our national security.  And let's help our allies around the world.  Stop hitting and attacking Israel and letting Iran get the pathway to a nuclear weapon.  Donald Trump said he will reverse that bad deal.  Hillary wants to support that horrible deal with Iran that lets them get a nuclear weapon.  There's a huge contrast between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on national security, which is going to be a top issue.  BARTIROMO:  And you think that's resonating with independent voters.  You know, Ed Rollins has said on this program many times, this is the highest number of undecided and independents in this election than we've seen in decades.  So, you've got Hillary supporters here, and Donald Trump supporters here and this enormous block in the middle of folks who have not made up their mind and who are independent.  How do the Republicans resonate with that audience?  SCALISE:  Well, I think the positions that Donald Trump has on national security and job creation are going to be the two driving issues of this campaign.  On both fronts, Donald Trump has the right policies and Hillary Clinton supports continuing in essence a third term of Barack Obama which -- look at Obama, 14 million more Americans have left the workforce, given up looking for work because the economy's so bad.  And Hillary Clinton talks about how great everything is.  She talked about how great our foreign policy is, when everybody looks at what's going on around the world and realizes that America's walked way from a lot of our allies.  They're calling on us to do more to help them in the war against terror.  And Hillary Clinton won't call it radical Islamic terrorism.  When Muslim leaders around the world are saying these people are hijacking our religion, call it out for what it is, radical Islamic terrorism.  She won't utter the word.  So, I think there's a huge contrast.  And I think when you look at that first debate in September, it's going to be Super Bowl type numbers.  I think everybody is going to be watching, and they're going to see a real contrast in vision and approach.  And that's what's going to drive this election, is what are their plans to turn the economy around, to make America safe again.  Donald Trump has a clear different direction to strengthen America. Hillary Clinton wants this same failed path.  BARTIROMO:  I agree.  Everybody is going to be watching that debate closely.Congressman, good to have you.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.  SCALISE:  Great being back, Maria.  BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Congressman Steve Scalise joining us there.  The FBI director says he's confident ISIS will be defeated in the Middle East, but adds that this is could come with serious consequences here at home.  Why he thinks Americans are in danger, as we look ahead this morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""  We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A new warning from the FBI director in the fight against ISIS.  James Comey says defeating ISIS in its stronghold of Syria and Iraq will lead to more terrorism in Europe and the United States.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR:  Not all of the Islamic State's killers are going to die on the battle field.  Hundreds and hundreds of them which the coalition succeeds, and I'm confident it will, in crushing the Islamic State, through the fingers of that crush are going to come hundreds of really dangerous people.  They're going to flow out primarily towards Western Europe.  But we might as well be right next door to Western Europe given the ease that people can travel.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Dr. Sebastian Gorka. He's the Major General Matthew C. Horner distinguish chair of military theory at Marine Corps University.  He's the author of ""Defeating Jihad"".  Dr. Gorka, good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.  DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, MARINE CORPS UNIVERSITY:  Thank you.  It's my pleasure.  BARTIROMO:  What's your take on Jim Comey's commentary there?  Yes, we crush them ultimately, but lots of people come out of that crush who are incredibly dangerous and who will continue their fight.  GORKA:  Well, Maria, I'm not as confident as Director Comey that we're on the cusp of crushing ISIS.  If you just look at the weakness of our local allies and the collapse of the Iraqi forces, I don't think that's imminent at all.  But his broader conclusion is absolutely correct.  The more they lose territory in the region, the more likely they are to send people over here. I've just posted on my Twitter feed, thanks to Tom Joscelyn at the ""Long War Journal"", the latest issue of Dabiq, the ISIS English language magazine, has just been published.  And it's entitled ""Break the Cross."" It has a photograph of an ISIS fighter on top of a Christian Church in the Middle East, taking down the cross on the church.They have declared war on all of us.  They've declared war on Christians everywhere.  This is exactly what we should expect.  ISIS has said already, they're going to put their people into the refugee streams.  We know one of the Brussels attackers was on a false Syrian passport and he had won refugee status.  This is the new war, Maria, and this is what we have to be prepared for.BARTIROMO:  It's really extraordinary, actually, Dr. Gorka.  How do you think we are going to get through this?  Is there a candidate who has the best plan here to defeat ISIS?  What's your view?  GORKA:  Look, that's a really tough question to answer strangely.  On the one side with Hillary Clinton, we have somebody who says she's going to basically continue everything President Obama has done.  She refused for the longest time until the Nice attack to even use the phrase radical Islam and then said something like radical jihadism, whatever that is.  But her tenure as president I think would be as bad if not worse than President Obama's because remember, she was secretary of state when we had the disastrous policies in Libya, when we had the catastrophe in Benghazi, we had the pullout of our troops in Iraq.  So, no, I'm not confident she can save American lives.  And then, you asked me about Mr. Trump.  I've met Mr. Trump.  I've advised on national security issues last year.  He clearly believes we are at war.   He wants to win.  He has no time for political correctness.  But I have yet to see the details, at least the broad outline of what he wishes to do to defeat ISIS.  So, that's not comforting either.  BARTIROMO:  What about those that criticize the border wall who say we don't want to become so isolating?  GORKA:  No, that goes against common sense.  Why does anybody put a wall around anything?  To protect it.  Do you value America?  Do you wish to have America be safe?  The wall is a necessity if you want to protect America and to stop things happening like the attacks we've seen lately.  If you look at just common crime, it makes sense.  Why do you build a wall ever?  Because you want to protect the things that you value.  BARTIROMO:  Right.  Dr. Gorka, good to see you.  Thanks so much for your insights.  GORKA:  Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Dr. Sebastian Gorka there.Let's get a check in now on ""Media Buzz"" top of the hour.  Howie Kurtz is standing by.Howie, good morning to you.HOWIE KURTZ, ""MEDIABUZZ"" HOST:  Good morning, Maria.  We'll look at the mostly positive coverage of Hillary Clinton's convention when we were in Philadelphia.  Contrast that with Donald Trump's convention in Cleveland.  Also, look at the way in which Donald Trump hijacked part of the media spotlight with that marathon press conference, and now, how the press has kind of elevated this Muslim father whose son tragically killed in Iraq, and the way in which he has drawn Donald Trump into a war of words.  That and much more coming up on the show.  BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will see you in about 20 minutes, Howie.  Thanks so much.  Up next, Donald Trump got a big boost in the polls after the Republican convention.  SO, will Hillary Clinton get that kind of a post-convention bounce?  Frank Luntz is with me to talk about it, as we look ahead this morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures"".  We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Donald Trump enjoying a boost in the polls after the Republican convention.   Will Hillary Clinton get the same kind of bounce after the Democratic National Convention?  As it stands now, the latest Real Clear Politics average shows Clinton leading by about one point.  What a tight race.Let's bring it up right now with Frank Luntz.  He is pollster and FOX News contributor.  And always great to see you, Frank.  Thanks for joining us.  FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Pleasure.  BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  What are you expecting after the Democratic National Convention for Hillary Clinton's numbers?  LUNTZ:  I'm expecting her to go to roughly three or four-point lead which is exactly what existed before the Republican Convention.  Both candidates will get smaller than average bounces.  But you normally look at it in this point in the 21st century is a bounce of about 4 percent, 5 percent, 6 percent.  Anything bigger and it's truly significant.The other thing Maria is that I don't believe there's a significant number of undecided voters out there.  In fact, I think it's only about 10 percent.  And the reason why, is that people will say to you, will say to a pollster, well, I'm undecided.  How likely are you to vote for Hillary Clinton? Well, I'm not sure.  Well, what about Donald Trump?  No way.  So, they say they're undecided because they haven't made the absolute commitment to one candidate, but they've already dismissed the other.  I think it's really only one out of ten voters that are truly undecided at this point.  BARTIROMO:  I see.  OK.  So, not as many undecided.What about independents, Frank?  LUNTZ:  There's a greater degree because many Americans are rejecting the Republican and Democratic ideology.BARTIROMO:  They don't want to be labeled.  LUNTZ:  Exactly.  But that's part of this whole millennial thing, where they don't want to be grouped into some category.  It's not that they aren't.  They may still vote that way, they just don't want to be labeled that way.  BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the issues that are important to people.We know that national security and the economy keep coming up as the number one and number two issues for the American people.  Do you think that is what is going to drive them?  What will drive voters going into this election in November?  LUNTZ:  Well, I'm going to challenge conventional wisdom again, because what will drive independents and what will drive those who are the remainder of the undecideds isn't issues.  It's not policy.  It's the attributes, the character traits of the candidates.  Do I trust them?  Do they say what they mean and mean what they say?  Are they going to be a consistent leader in times of crisis?Those are the attributes.  Look, if you're a Republican, you have an ideology.  If you're a Democrat, you have a philosophy.  But if you're an independent, you're looking at the character traits of the candidate. That's what's going to help you make that decision.  And, frankly, both Trump and Clinton helped themselves during their conventions by promoting who they are as people.  Not just where they stand on the issues.  BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Yes, because it was largely about that at the Democratic National Convention, right?  I mean, Bill Clinton talking about we met in 1971 and took us through their lives.  Her daughter Chelsea doing the same thing, talking about what kind of a mother she has been.  And then on the Republican side, same thing.  It's what we heard from all of Trump's children.  Do you think that's going to resonate more than OK, here's what I'm going to do for you and here's why this economic policy will move the needle on your family's fortunes?  LUNTZ:  So, I want to be candid through this entire election process. Donald Trump Jr. outperformed expectations more than any of the relatives.  BARTIROMO:  I agree with you.LUNTZ:  You assume Chelsea Clinton is going to do well, because she's been doing this now since he was a child.  This is something brand-new for Trump Jr.  And there was this humility that the public responded so favorably to.Now, let me do the converse.  To my surprise, Bill Clinton did not perform as well.  I'm going to be talking about this on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" tomorrow night.  Clinton's presentation people thought was disingenuous and did not tell the whole story.  Maria, if you're going to talk about the personality and the persona of the candidate, you have to be candid, you have to be open, and you're going to need to acknowledge the good and the bad, or the public's simply not going to believe you.  BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You did not see the kind of euphoria after Bill Clinton for sure.  And, yes, you make a really good point, because people have their feelings about Hillary and Donald.  And if you try to be somebody you're not, who they don't think that's who you are, they will react and they will reject.  LUNTZ:  And there's a lesson to this, which is the strongest speech of them all was the Khan family.  I know that Howie Kurtz in a moment is going to discuss that making him into a celebrity.  The fact is, his presentation was incredibly powerful and it caused undecided voters to pause and consider what he was saying.  BARTIROMO:  Authentic.  Yes.LUNTZ:  He's authentic and it's not a politician.  This is where the Democrats made mistake, and the Republicans could have gone even further. It's real people that the American people want to hear from, not their elected officials.  BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.  Great to see you, Frank.  Thanks so much.LUNTZ:  Thank you.BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon, Frank Luntz.Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump turning their attention to the general election now.  Will their conventions set new tones in their campaigns? Our political panel weighs in next.  We're looking ahead right now, ""Sunday Morning Futures"" continues.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  With the conventions now behind them, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are officially pivoting to the general election.  Their first debate is expected in September, end of September.  They're out on the campaign trail, making their case to the American people.  I want to bring in our panel right now, Ed Rollins, the former campaign manager for the Reagan Bush ticket in 1984, chief strategist for Great America PAC and a FOX News political analyst.  Jessica Tarlov with us.  She is a Democratic strategist and a strategist, and senior political analyst at Schoen Consulting.  Steve Moore is with us, an economic adviser to Donald Trump and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation.  Good to see, everybody.  ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Thank you.JESSICA TARLOV, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Good morning.Take us through what happens now, Ed Rollins.ROLLINS:  August is the hardest month of all, because it's a month in which there's no big items.  The Olympics is a big distraction.  A lot of people going to vacation.  So, you go out and you campaign a lot, but you don't necessarily move numbers.I think the key thing, as Luntz said, I think it's going to be a three or four-point race when Hillary gets the final bump, and then you'll slog it away.  You'll have to make sure if you're Donald Trump, who's not going to run a conventional campaign, she is -- he's not.  That she not basically damage him with a negative advertising while the rest, they're going to do the four-month while he is out doing rallies and tweets and what have you.  BARTIROMO:  So the narratives are real important for these next two months. What's the Democratic narrative?  What's most important that you think, Jess, is going to resonate with voters?  TARLOV:  Well, I think the shift that they've made, where they acknowledge the progressivism of the party platform now and all that Obama has accomplished.  But you saw both Hillary and Tim Kaine making the shift to say, we know things aren't perfect, and that was the first time that they've done that, where they said we've made dramatic gains, but we know that your ages haven't increased that much.  We know we still have work to do.  So, I'm looking to see them in August going out there, to do kind of I feel your pain tour.  But we have the answers and we are sane and we're competent.  Those were the key words I took away from the convention on the Democrats.BARTIROMO:  Yes, certainly from Michael Bloomberg.  He gave a great speech.TARLOV:  And the independence.  Tim Kaine, he's so good for religious voters and independents.  You know, very moderate out there.  I know it disappointed the Bernie supporters.  BARTIROMO:  Yes.TARLOV:  But I think he's a smart pick for this general.BARTIROMO:  This is a hard narrative to tell when you have the kind of numbers we saw on Friday, Steve Moore, like the GDP number.  STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE FOUNDATION:  I agree with that.  By the way, I think Michael Bloomberg was mostly jealous of Donald Trump.  But you're right.  These numbers, I think they eclipse, for all the talk about those two conventions.  This is the most important thing that's happened in the last couple of weeks politically, which is that we got this horrible economic number.  The economy now for the last six to nine months is growing at 1 percent.  I look back at the last 50 years.  The party in power does not get elected for the White House, when you got those.  I mean you remember when you were working around Reagan against Jimmy Carter.  I mean, it just killed Carter when those economic collapsed.BARTIROMO:  Really?MOORE:  So, I think it's really a difficult story and narrative for Hillary.  She tried, you know, to thread that needle.  And the other problem is, if you listen to that speech, what does she propose?  Raise the minimum wage.  More public works, shovel-ready projects, tax the rich.  That's exactly what Obama has done for the last eight years.  So, there's nothing new here.  BARTIROMO:  Listen, Dan Malloy just said to me, the governor of Connecticut, I don't know where you're getting that.  He's not going to raise taxes on small business.  But if you're raising taxes on the highest earners, connect the dots for us.  (CROSSTALK)MOORE:  And you know what's interesting?  You're exactly right.  Over half of them are small business owners or investors or operators.  So, how are you going to get more jobs if you tax the businesses?  But the interesting thing about that interview with Dan Malloy, is he did raise taxes on the rich in Connecticut.  In Connecticut, the economy is a disaster right now.  And, in fact, they are losing jobs and they have big budget deficits.  BARTIROMO:  That's why HIS poll numbers are where they are.  ROLLINS:  And population.  People are moving out of Connecticut.BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.  And even corporations like GE.  The critical thing is there that, both got out of their conventions what they wanted, the hard part for Hillary, who has a unified party, I admit. She's got to get some of the Bernie people back in the camp, but she is trying to sell the Obama message again when 70 percent to 80 percent of the country, depending on the polls, think the country is on the wrong direction.  That's a very, very hard uphill swim.  Where Trump basically is coming in, give me the ball, I'll fix it.  I'm LeBron James.  Give me the ball.  I'll win the championship for you.  BARTIROMO:  Yes.ROLLINS:  And that's --  (CROSSTALK)MOORE:  Trump is so undisciplined.  Now, if he would just stick to talking about terrorism --BARTIROMO:  Can he do it?(CROSSTALK)TARLOV:  Well, he obviously can't.  I mean, if you look at the attacks on the Khan's family and Khan's mother wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post that came out this morning where she essentially said, you know, I didn't need to say anything, America and everyone watching felt my pain.  I knew what I had about the loss of my son, and about what Donald Trump is talking.  You know, calling General Allen a failed general, no one on the left stood up and said Michael Flynn is a failed general because he backs Donald Trump.  And when you're running as the America, right, we're going to make America great again, and you're going out there and you're attacking our finest, which our military is.  I think that's the major problem.  And where the Democrats are going to move here, is they are painting them as un-American.  And Americans care about their pocketbooks, but they also care about our national pride and who we are as a nation.  ROLLINS:  You can't paint him as un-American.  I think the one that you came through is a very strong leader.  In the contrast here, she is a good policy wonk.  She obviously would carry out the Obama agenda, if that's what you want.  But he's a strong change agent, and I think the country wants a change agent.  He basically has to not get distracted by these kinds of things we're talking about right here.  He has to stay right on his message and his message is, I can fix ISIS by going after them heavily, I can fix the economy by doing some of the things I've talked about, and I can make the government work because I have never been there and I don't think it functions will and I'm going to change it.  MOORE:  I live in Virginia, the battleground state, so I'm seeing all these TV ads.  And Hillary's TV ad is, you know, I was there.  I met with all of these foreign leaders.  BARTIROMO:  That's the problem.MOORE:  I'm not sure it works, because people say, yeah, you created this problem.  BARTIROMO:  Right.Quick break, and then the one thing to watch in the week ahead from our panel, right here in ""Sunday Morning Futures"".  Back in a minute.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Back with the panel looking ahead.What are you looking at, Steve?  MOORE:  Later this week, we're going to come out with the Trump economic plan, the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan.  We'll take growth from 1 percent to 4 percent.  BARTIROMO:  Wow.Jessica?  TARLOV:  I'm looking to see how well the Democrats continue to unify what's going to happen with all the Bernie Sanders supporters.  Not the anarchists who are picking up trouble, but the Bernie people.BARTIROMO:  Ed Rollins?ROLLINS:  I'm going to look at the polls.  Polls, a lot of polls coming out this week.  She'll regain the momentum.  She'll be three or four points ahead, as Luntz said, maybe a little bit more and then we move forward.  BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thanks so much to our panel.  I'll see you next week on Fox.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" January 15, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Breaking tonight, just 24 hours after the big Republican debate.  Media outlets across America are now declaring this contest effectively a four-man race.  And tonight, two of the four will be right here.  Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly.  Seven men squared off last night and one of the most entertaining debates of the 2016 election cycle.  But when the dust settled, analysts declared the regular season is now over and the playoffs are finally here.  But are they right?  We'll have more on that in a moment.  First, National Journal saying, South Carolina debate crowns a GOP final four that Trump shows he is a front-runner.  Rubio and Cruz duke it out and Christie hangs tough.  Townhall arguing Trump Cruz and Rubio pulled away from the pocket's last night's debate.  And National Review with a similar take.  Saying, the Republican primary is increasingly focus on four men.   Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie.  In moments, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will be here.  Plus, we'll have in-depth analysis from the life of Chris Stirewalt and Howard Kurtz.  Bret Baier, one of my co-moderator at the next debates which happens on January 28th.  And then we will speak with Dana Perino about the biggest price of all.  The general election in which of these guys could possibly best Hillary Clinton.  But we begin tonight with Frank Luntz and his focus group.  They got the chance to speak to one of the other candidates that made very big headlines last night.  Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Watch this.  FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER:  Senator Ted Cruz.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Senator, what would you want this South Carolina audience to know about you and your candidacy?SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, listen, rather than give a speech you guys have endured a two-and-a-half hour debate.  So the last thing you need is filibustering.  I do think we saw some good contrast tonight.  I do think we had a good opportunity to compare the candidates, compare our records, compare our vision.  I thought, by the way, I thought FOX Business did a fabulous job moderating.  I haven't always thought that.  But this one, I thought there were good questions.  You know, what I would like to do rather than yabber at folks is just have a conversation.  I mean, I would love to ask you guys, what do you wish had been asked?  What do you wish we had been talking about?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I want to hear about the health care.  How are we going to change that?  CRUZ:  Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many health care feels and how it fears for the future of our country and health care?  How can we change it if you're elected?CRUZ:  Listen, health care is fundamental to all of us.  I think we need to start by repealing every word of ObamaCare.  I think ObamaCare has been a disaster.  Excellent.(LAUGHTER)I've never seen those dials.  I watched them on TV but never seen them.  LUNTZ:  There's your score right there.  You have an 83-86.  CRUZ:  But well, listen, once we repeal ObamaCare, nobody thinks we're done.  We need common sense health care reform and I think it needs to follow principles of expanding competition, expanding the marketplace, and empowering consumers to make health care decisions in consultation with their doctors.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When you say repeal, how easy is that to actually do?CRUZ:  So, it's a great question.  It is not easy to do.  And the sad reality is an awful lot of politicians in Washington, both Democrats and a lot of Republicans, are largely resigned to ObamaCare being a permanent feature of our economy.  The only way I think we can repeal it is to make this election a referendum on repealing ObamaCare and also on adopting a simple flat tax.  Those are the two big legislative packages that I'm running on.  Neither one of those could get done today in Washington.  But if we come out of November 2016 with a mandate from the people, you change the rules, you change the dynamics in Washington.  There is an old joke that politics is Hollywood for ugly people.  Which my wife says I resemble that joke.  (LAUGHTER)But, you know, that -- go back to 1981.  Think about the last time we beat what I call the Washington cartel.  The career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests.  The Reagan revolution came from the people and this was this incredible tidal wave that changes Washington.  And, you know, in 1981, Tip O'Neill, the democratic speaker of the House, told Ronald Reagan, don't even send your tax plan over.  It is dead on arrival.  I've got 20 votes to kill it.  And Reagan didn't go and try to cajole him and use his Irish wit.  Reagan went over their heads.  Reagan went to the American people, made the case to the American people.  People began lighting up the phones.  And tip saw his votes disappearing, 20 became 19, became 18, became 17.  And that's how we got tax reform cutting the top rate from 70 percent to 28 percent.  That's the only way we actually repeal ObamaCare is that same sort of grassroots movement from the people.  LUNTZ:  But they are very skeptical.  And I want the second row to answer this question.  I'm going to start with you.  I asked you all what you think of Congress.  And none of you like the Republicans there, even though you're all Republican, give the senator a word or phrase to describe what you think of Congress.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do-nothing.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Traitors.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I hate to say this, but with all due respect, it's a big embarrassing joke.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yep.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Joke.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Out of touch.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I say traitor except for you.  Because I started to read your book.  CRUZ:  Thank you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I say, unprincipled.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Weak.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Inept.  LUNTZ:  So, it's a way it close out this segment.  Why are you different?  CRUZ:  Well, listen, I agree with everything that's been said.  I mean, people are frustrated out of our minds.  For one thing we keep winning elections.  We won a tidal wave election in 2010.  One control of the House.  We won another tidal wave election in 2014 and what does leadership do?  Funds all of Obama's priorities.  It funds ObamaCare, it funds amnesty.  It funds the Iran deal, it funds the Syrian refugees.  I mean, it's nuts.  And the only way to change it, look, is coming from the people.  You know, what I tried to do in the Senate from day one is been two things, tell the truth and do what I said I would do.  And I promise you, by the way, as bad as you think it is, it's worse.  Susan mentioned very kindly that she is reading my book.  You know, the whole book is what I call the Washington cartel.  It's about telling the inside story.  Where what's happening is, leadership in both parties are not listening to the people who elected them.  They are listening to the big money in Washington and the only way to change it is going back to the last time we did it.  Building grassroots movement.  Why all of my time is in the grassroots trying to energize, trying to empower because frankly I can't break the cartel, but you can.  That's the only power strong enough.  It is the people rising up and forcing the elected officials in both parties to listen to them and be accountable to them.  LUNTZ:  Do you guys agree to that?  Does he sound different to you?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.LUNTZ:  You will get a chance to ask him -- wait.  Does he sound different to you?  Yes or no?  Who says he sounds different than the typical member of Congress, raise your hands.  Not bad.  Who says he doesn't?  Two people.  What question would you ask Senator Cruz?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The question I would ask you is, what makes you think you can beat Hillary Clinton?LUNTZ:  Great question.  CRUZ:  Great question.  It is the single most important question.  I think our country is in crisis.  If we keep going down this road, we will going to lose our country.  My daughters are seven and five.  I'm scared for the country they inherit if we don't win.  Now what we hear over and over again on TV from all the folks in Washington, is the way we win is to run to the middle.  Is to run and basically to run Democrat-like.  That's what we're told.  And I'm a numbers guy, a data guy.  We got to win.  If you look at the last election, we won, 2004, you compare it to 2008 and `12, the single biggest difference is the millions of conservatives who showed up in '04, who stayed home in '08 and stayed home in bigger numbers in '12.  And they fall basically in two categories.  Evangelical Christians and Reagan Democrats, blue collar working class, I think the number one issue if we were going to win in 2016, is how do you bring those millions of conservatives back to the polls?  And I'll tell you, Heidi and I before we launched the campaign, I mean, we spent a lot of months in prayer thinking about it.  You don't lightly throw a young family with two little girls into the insanity of a presidential race.  And the biggest factor that led us to go forward is that I look at the other candidates, people who I like and respect, I don't see any other candidates who I think are likely to energize and mobilize and inspire those millions of conservatives that have been staying home and to bring together that old Reagan coalition.  And the reason I decided to run is that I think based on the record I've built of standing and fighting for conservative principles over and over again that I'm in the best position to bring the evangelicals back, to bring the Reagan Democrats back, to reassemble that Reagan coalition and that's the only way I believe we win.  LUNTZ:  How many of you think, if it is Ted Cruz versus Hillary Clinton, how many of you think Ted Cruz wins?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He better.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No question.  (LAUGHTER)KELLY:  How about that?  Joining me now, Chris Stirewalt, our FOX News digital politics editor and Howie Kurtz, host of Media Buzz right here on FNC.  It's pretty extraordinary to see that exchange moments after he was up on that stage, and it does speak to Ted Cruz's gift of, you know, being able to articulate his positions and where he stands so well.  Let me start with that last piece, Stirewalt though.  The piece about the millions of conservatives who stayed at home.  I've read a lot of pieces saying that is a myth and that is not true and that the way the Republicans actually have to win this year, and you tell me, this is just what I've read from smart people, is to get -- is to peel off some of the Obama coalition.  CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  Well, first, I like how they ask, do you think you could beat Hillary Clinton when he was standing right there.  What the heck were they going to say?  No, this guy is a loser.  Get him out of here.  They are both right.  Ted Cruz is right is that what we are talking right here are white males essentially in the upper Midwest.  We're talking about Ohio.  Pennsylvania.  Wisconsin.  We're talking about those voters.  They underperform.  They underperform 2012 there.  Those folks are not the Obama coalition.   And Republicans expected them to turn out and they were not there.  That having been said, that ain't going to feed the bulldog.  Republicans needs to be able to do both things at once.  They need to walk and chew gum.  They need to get their coalition strengthened and revitalized but simultaneously be able to do well with, yes Hispanic voters, yes, Asian voters, yes younger voters.  But first and foremost, what do they have to do?  They have to succeed with female voters --  KELLY:  Women.STIREWALT: -- and especially female voters who have college degrees and are more affluent.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  Howie, do you agree before we went to that segment with the headlines that this is now a four-man race?HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"":  No.  I think it is a two-person race with Rubio and Christie having had good -- at the moment.  KELLY:  Cruz and Trump you're saying?KURTZ:  And Ted and Trump.  Yes.  But here is the thing, I mean, Ted is a good talker.  As we saw right there.  And he stood up to Trump.  And that helped him.  But it remains to be seen whether the Texas debate champion is built for the kind of New York Street fighting he needs for Trump.  And speaking of New York, you know, we all in this business Megyn, we score who scored who landed the punch, who deflected the karate chop.  From talking to civilians and listening to the media echo chamber, I think that that exchange that we say Trump won over New York values, when he invoked the heartbreak and the bravery of 9/11 may have been more than just winning the moment.  In talking to civilians as I say, I think a guy who's known for a bombast and insults was able to project a more compassionate site in a way that could resonate beyond just a few news cycles.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  Chris, last night, people were saying, Rich Lowry was suggesting, if Trump wins Iowa and New Hampshire, he runs the table.  And that's it.  Today, there were some push back on claims like that by people like Charlie Cook saying, hold on.  There is a whole lot more delegates that come after those initial states.  And when we get to March, that's where we get into the winner take all and suggesting it is not really going to be done after Iowa and New Hampshire.  Your thoughts.STIREWALT:  When it comes to picking a president, picking a nominee, you eat like a cowboy.  Cowboy's only got one dish.  So, he can only eat one thing at a time.  KELLY:  Beans.  STIREWALT:  Usually beans.  That's Mel Brooks.  But you only can have one, and through the month of February, you can only have one election at a time.  So how you do in Iowa affects how do you in New Hampshire.  Which affects how do you in South Carolina.  Which affects how you do in Nevada.   Which then talks about going into March where you get two big days plus a Michigan primary.  There's a lot of interconnectedness.  There's a lot of inner dependency here.  So, here is what I would say, to anybody who says, well, you win there, she wins that, you run the table, it's over.  Yes.  Or no.  We don't know this cycle.  We don't know what it is like to have a person with a hundred percent name ID who is creating absolute snap crackle pop in the electorate like Donald Trump is.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.STIREWALT:  But in both directions.  We don't know how this is going to pan out.  So, we would be fools to sit here --KELLY:  Go ahead, Howie.  KURTZ:  I would just say this.  If Ted Cruz doesn't get Iowa after getting expectations so high, he will miss his best chance to slow down the Trump express.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.KURTZ:  And by the way, Washington Post top political writer has a story today with the headlines, can Donald Trump actually be the Republican nominee.  And I would say, can it actually be after all these months of Trump being dominants that we are still asking that question.  Of course he can.  Whether he will be stopped is another question.  KELLY:  Great to see you both.  Thank you.  STIREWALT:  You bet.KURTZ:  Thank you.KELLY:  Long night for them.  And I appreciate them staying out and doing this.   Well, as we mentioned, one of the men who finds himself in the so-called final four after last night's debate will join us in moments.  We will ask Governor Chris Christie about the controversy that continues to dog him as he tries to defend his record.  Plus, would you vote for a candidate you like even if you believed they could not beat Hillary Clinton?  Dana Perino is just ahead on how that question could start changing this race.  And then, it's the Powerball winner who wasn't.  Horrifying new details on how one poor nurse with the terrible, terrible son, went from thinking that she won the billion dollars to learning it appears to have been a cruel prank.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I said he supported Sonia Sotomayor, who is one of the most liberal justices on the Supreme Court because he supported her nomination.  He denies it.  This is a quote, politicker New Jersey on July 17th, 2009, this is a quote.  I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  That was Senator Marco Rubio just hours ago reacting to his clash with Governor Chris Christie at the Fox Business Network debate last night. Mr. Rubio and Christie found themselves in a sort of mini debate over Governor Christie's record on everything from the Supreme Court as you heard there, to gun control and even common core.  Governor Christie joins us in a moment to respond.  But first Trace Gallagher is here with how the fact checkers scored this.   Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, PolitiFact says the Governor Christie's claim that he did not support Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor is flat out false.  We found out that he certainly did call her nomination and historic moment that should make the Latino community and all-Americans proud but it is also clear that she would not have been at the top of Chris Christie's list.  Quote, ""While Judge Sotomayor would not have been my choice President Obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the Supreme Court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability, competence and ability.""  Christie also claims he never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood but in a New Jersey star Ledger Article from September of `94, Christie was quoted saying, I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency to find private donations.""  Christie is now convinced he was misquoted.  The Washington Post says, he was either misleading voters in `94 or is doing so now.  As for Christie supporting common core educational standards, turns out he did before he didn't.  He said quote, ""This is one of those areas where I've agreed more with the President than not.""But last year, he said, again quoting, ""It's been five years since common core was adopted.  Truth is, it's not working.""  Christie also claims common core has been eliminated in New Jersey and while it has been substantially cut back, it has not yet been eliminated.  When it comes to gun control, Chris Christie has used his experience as a federal prosecutor to argue both sides.  In 2009, the Washington Post wrote that as a federal prosecutor, Christie saw that a certain gun control measures can help take illegal guns away without infringing on second amendment rights.  Now he's become more pro-gun rights saying, quoting, ""The biggest reason I changed my mind was my seven years as a federal prosecutor"" -- Megyn.KELLY:  Trace, thank you.  Joining us now, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican candidate for president.  Governor, good to see you.  Thanks for being here.  So, what do you make of these?  Let's just tick through them quickly.  Because I want to give you the chance to respond.  On Sotomayor, you tell me, you seemed to be saying, I didn't want her, she wasn't my choice.  But you did ultimately throw your support behind her.  So when Rubio said you supported her, what is wrong about that?GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He is wrong.  Because what I said was, she wasn't my kind of judge.  She would not have been my choice.  And she is not somebody that would have wanted on the bench.  But what I did say afterwards Megyn was that, she deserved an up or down vote.  And people should give her an up or down vote the same way I demanded that they give Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts in an up or down vote.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  But you said specifically, I support her appointment to the Supreme Court.  I support her.  You called it a historic moment.  An inspiring success story that should not only make the Latino community proud but all- Americans.  CHRISTIE:  It is an inspiring success story for the Latino community.  It doesn't mean I would have appointed her to the Supreme Court.  I clearly said that I didn't.  I wouldn't have supported her to the Supreme Court.  KELLY:  OK.  CHRISTIE:  So, the fact is though, Megyn, this is the stuff that you do if you're United States senator, and this is why nothing gets done down there.  Because you take people's words out of context.  You don't give it a complete meaning.  And then you create gridlock.  I mean, that's what Marco has been very good at, when he showed up for work.  KELLY:  He is trying to paint you as a guy who is pretty liberal and not as conservative as he is.  And so, that's why he is taking off his example.  Let's talk about the Planned Parenthood one.CHRISTIE:  Megyn, wait a second, Megyn.  Before -- Megyn --  KELLY:  Go ahead.  CHRISTIE:  Megyn, before we go on, I mean, it is kind of funny that the guy who is the author of the gang of eight amnesty bill, he coauthored it with Chuck Schumer, that granted amnesty, to people who are here illegally, is now saying that someone else is not a conservative.  And as soon as the heat got turned up there, he turned tail and ran.  KELLY:  But now I want to tick through these with you.  Because I know you can defend your record --  CHRISTIE:  Sure.KELLY:  So, I would love to hear your defense.  The Planned Parenthood thing is in black and white.  The Washington Post says, you said it, you say I was misquoted.  It is a pretty detailed explanation of, you didn't want public funds going to Planned Parenthood.  That is what you were trying to tell them.  CHRISTIE:  Correct.  Yes.KELLY:  But in making that case, they say, you got specific and said, look, I support them privately with my personal contributions.  That should be the goal of any agency to find private donations.  They completely busted that up?  They got that totally wrong?  Did you dispute it at the time?CHRISTIE:  No.  Here is how they got it wrong, Megyn.  What I said was, that organizations like that should be supported with private funds.  And I do that.  Not that organization.  That organizations like that should not be getting government funding.  And that's how they messed up the quote.  KELLY:  How about the gun?CHRISTIE:  And I don't hold it against him.  Because he works for me now.  KELLY:  Because last time, last night on the guns, you touted the fact that you once proposed a ban that you once vetoed a bill that would have banned future sales of this .50 caliber rifle.  But isn't it true that you were the one who first proposed that ban on the .50 caliber rifle?  Before you were against it, you were the one proposing it?CHRISTIE:  No, it was a commission that I put together, it was a group of folks who made recommendations to me.  I look forward at all those recommendations, and then the legislature came back and what they wanted to do was not only ban future sales, they wanted to confiscate guns that have already been purchased and I said, you know, this bill just goes too far and I vetoed it.  KELLY:  But you were the one who proposed a ban on the .50 caliber rifle, right?CHRISTIE:  Megyn, a group of people who are putting forward advice to me on a whole range of gun control and gun related bills put that forward.  It was forwarded out of the governor's office.  And the legislature did not do what we asked them to do.  Here is the problem with Senator Rubio.  Last night he rattled off a bunch of things that his awful research guys have given him.  Then when I started answering back, he didn't answer back last night, when I was on the stage.  He waits until he gets to New Hampshire.  And you'll notice, look at the split screen, when I'm talking to him, he can't even look at me.  He cannot even look at me after making those charges.  And so, you know, the fact is that Marco has a lot of guts when I'm not standing next to him.  But last night when I'm standing next to him, he would not have brought it up if Neil Cavuto would not have brought it up himself in the question.  And then when I answered it and he has the opportunity, he could have said right back to me, no, Governor you're wrong, those defenses are wrong.  He certainly argued back and forth enough with Ted Cruz last night.  Why didn't he take a look at me and tell me that I wasn't telling the truth when I was saying, he was being disingenuous.  Because he didn't have the guts to do it.  Because he knows that he is twisting the facts like any senator does.  They twist the facts.  Filibuster.  And he didn't, you know, he couldn't justify his position.  KELLY:  Maybe he was embarrassed that you guys were wearing the same outfit.  It's like, that's how, you know, women do it at a party.  Just try not to make eye contact.  It's awkward.  (LAUGHTER)Governor.  Thank you for doing this.  CHRISTIE:  Well, you know, I always send Marco my tie choice beforehand.  And if he disregards it, then that's up to him.  KELLY:  That's right.  That's on him.  All the best.  CHRISTIE:  On him, Megyn.  KELLY:  See you soon.  CHRISTIE:  Thank you.  KELLY:  It is awkward, right?  That's why I have to wear something like this with a collar blocking.  Because you never know what's going to happen.  So now you have heard from Governor Christie.  You heard from Senator Cruz. What about the rest of the field?  Bret Baier is here next with his takeaway from the showdown in South Carolina and what it means for the next debate hosted by FNC on January 28.  Plus, after a son pulled a billion dollar Powerball prank on his mother, her boss steps in to try to make it right.  A story you have to see straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO:  Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander-in-chief of the United States.  Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander-in-chief.  And someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  That was Florida Senator Marco Rubio last night scoring points on democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton with the reference to both her e- mail scandal and to the ongoing questions over how she handled Benghazi and the terror attack that happened there September 11th, 2012.  Joining me now, host of ""Special Report"" and one of my co-moderators in the upcoming Fox News debate Bret Baier.  So, Bret, we are lucky, because we get the last crack at these guys before the actual voting begins and with the Iowa caucuses.  And the next debate is January 28, just in case people aren't aware.  BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST, ""SPECIAL REPORT"":  It's going to be fun.  KELLY:  It's going to be really fun.  We're getting ready with our questions now.  So, those are sort of the twin issues.  He went to the place that hurts for Hillary, e-mails and Benghazi.  Let's just talk about that because you have done a lot of work on Benghazi, did an hour-long special, it was very compelling.  And now the movie has come out ""13 Hours,"" do you think that's going to resurrect as an issue?  I mean, how big an issue in this race?BAIER:  Yes.  Listen, Megyn, I think you're hearing more and more candidates raise it.  I think you had Donald Trump rent out a theater in Des Moines so people could see the movie ""13 Hours"" as part of a, you know, a voter ploy, I think.  Also you know, you heard the President mentioned Benghazi in the State of the Union.  From a pop culture standpoint, the Benghazi story just by this movie will reach more people.  It won't be as tough to understand in that format.  So, a lot of people will likely see that movie.  Plus you have the Benghazi Committee that eventually will come out with a report with details.  New details we're told that will paint the different picture behind the scenes.  So I think it will factor in, if not now then in the general election.KELLY:  What do you make of the predictions we heard in the first segment?  Howie Kurtz is saying he thinks it's a two-man race now.  He thinks it is Trump, Cruz and you could say good bye to everybody else.BAIER:  I think two-man race is a little tough to jump there.  A lot can happen, as you know, in a short period of time.  A lot depends on the ground game.  And we don't know until you get to the first vote.KELLY:  Don't they decide late in Iowa?  Like history shows they decide pretty late, right before the contest.BAIER:  Exactly.  And some of the people -- I was just there talking to a number of caucus goers, and they told me that they were leaning one way but they decided in the last two weeks, last cycle.  Sometimes in the last week, so you know who shows up in the firehouse in the middle of winter is different than some poll answering a telephone call.KELLY:  And the ground game.  We heard so much about the ground game in Iowa.  Apparently, Ted Cruz is very organized in this respect.  Trump is not.  But Trump's response is you've got -- you know 6,000 people who come to one of my rallies.  You're telling me they're not going to show up on voting day?  Even if they don't have a history of doing it, he doesn't believe they're not going to do it this time.BAIER:  That is a fair point.  There's a lot of passion on the Trump side.  But also in these Trump rallies, there are people with the campaigns saying don't forget you have to register as a Republican.  You know there are a lot of independents and Democrats who come out to see Trump and support Trump.  That factors in New Hampshire because it is an open primary.  In Iowa you have to be registered Republican.KELLY:  What do you think our challenge is with less than two weeks to go until our next debate?BAIER:  You know it is all about timing.  It is all about spinning struggling plates.KELLY:  I thought that wouldn't happen this time.BAIER:  No, Neil and Maria I think did a great job with all of the exchanges.KELLY:  Agreed.BAIER:  I this we will try to get to substance but also let it breath and let them talk about the issues that are key on the trail.KELLY:  Going to be exciting.  If you could only hear the debates we have behind the scenes.  First we beat up on each other.  Brett and Chris and I, and then we go out there...BAIER:  Then polish them down.KELLY:  Yes.  Brett's always talking about the dismount.  Improve on the dismount of your question.BAIER:  Always the dismount.KELLY:  And I think their questions are too wordy, great to see you, Brett.BAIER:  Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY:  Well, the Republican primary is one thing, but the general election is something else altogether.  Who now has a realistic shot at winning at all and who doesn't?  Dana Perino is here with new polling on the biggest question of all, just ahead.  And Frank Luntz and our focus group are back with the issues that made them mad as hell.  See how that may play out in early voting.FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER:  How many of you are mad as hell -- everybody.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Even before the first votes are cast, this is shaping up to be an election for the history books, as so-called nontraditional candidates find themselves driving the process, and trampling all over early predictions.  So what is driving the voters who are supporting those candidates?  Well, Frank Luntz put that question to the focus group.  Here he is with more.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LUNTZ:  More than half of them will tell you they are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore.  Let's find out what our South Carolinian voters think.  How many of you are mad as hell -- everybody.  What are you so angry at?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right now we are paying as much for refugees and immigrants in this country as we are paying for our V.A. veterans care right now, $168 billion a year.LUNTZ:  Are you that mad?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I am mad.LUNTZ:  Over what?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Our health care is going straight down the toilet.  We can't convince any doctors to treat patients.  Our military is not being supported.  And our borders are open.LUNTZ:  This anger that people feel, it's not productive, is it?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Health care.  I got laid off because of ObamaCare.  And it's not fair, people losing jobs, people losing money.  And people aren't-- I got to buy health care now and it is $350 a month.  I can't afford that.LUNTZ:  Some people have been protected by it.  Some people now have health care available.  Why does that make you so angry?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What bothers me the most in the country is that you can't even speak the truth anymore or else you will be called a racist or bigot or any other...LUNTZ:  So political correctness, does that bother you?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It bothers me very much.LUNTZ:  Because?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Because I have a right to my opinion without being labeled something.  It is ridiculous.  It has.LUNTZ:  You're calling it discrimination.  How?  Explain that.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, because anyone who says anything has to watch everything they say, and you can't label a spade a spade.  And everyone is afraid to talk.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What it really boils down for me is the cultural change.  I could have never imagined that in eight years of my country I could have seen such a huge cultural change.  LUNTZ:  What do you mean by that?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  An overwhelming umbrella of everything.  It goes to how we treat our veterans, it goes to how we treat our older people, and it is a cultural change.  How we are educating our children or not educating our children.  How we treat one another.  We have a majority of Republicans in a congress and we can't get anything done.  They are all voting with the Democrats.LUNTZ:  Who is mad at congress?  You're Republicans.  It's a Republican leadership.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All of them lie.LUNTZ:  Republicans in congress?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They have lied to us.  They can't get anything done.  They are lying because they say they will defeat Obamacare.  They've done nothing. They say they will protect social security...LUNTZ:  What do you want from them?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I want them to stop lying.  Tell the truth.LUNTZ:  I want to understand what's going on with Republicans in congress because they've got the house and senate.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want my government back.  I want my government back that is supposed to be a citizen legislature, not supposed to be a political class that has taken over and it is us versus them.LUNTZ:  What do you want congress to do?  They have a Democratic president.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They have been timid, weak.  Grow a backbone.  Follow the constitution.  Change it.LUNTZ:  You would impeach Barack Obama?  How many of you -- seriously?  How many of you by show of hands would impeach Barack Obama?  Come on.  Are you for real?(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He has broken so many laws that it is ridiculous that he is still in office.LUNTZ:  You would impeach Barack Obama?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Executive overreach.LUNTZ:  That's impeachable?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not impeachable but it shouldn't...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Nobody should be above the law, including the President of the United States.LUNTZ:  How many people believe in term limits for members of congress?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Absolutely.LUNTZ:  How many if you could, would throw every member of congress out and every incumbent and start over?  That's just about all of you.  In they are watching in Washington, you're in big, big trouble.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Coming up, meet the Powerball winner who wasn't.  And what is turning out to be a billion dollar prank.Up next after this break, Dana Perino on the effort to win the ultimate prize, the White House.LUNTZ:  How many of you by show of hands think at least one of them should drop out?  Raise your hands.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)LUNTZ:  How many of you by show of hands think at least one of them should drop out?  Raise your hands.  Ok, here we go.  I am going to countdown and tell the American people which candidate should be gone after tonight, ready, three, two, one...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Christie.KELLY:  One thing is absolutely clear.  Frank Luntz's focus group believes someone needs to drop out of this White House race.  Who should it be?  That's less clear.  Dana Perino is co-Host of ""The Five"" and former White House Press Secretary under President George W. Bush, and Author of the book ""And the Good News is,"" good to see you.DANA PERINO, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST:  Yes, I just got back from Charleston.KELLY:  I know.  You were there on a whirlwind tour.PERINO:  Yes.  I haven't had a chance to be there this year so I did get a feel for the crowd.  KELLY:  Obviously, Trump did very well.  Cruz did very well.  The question is, now that we seem to have the lanes defined, Trump and Cruz battling it out for true conservative.  Or I don't know whether Trump is a true conservative in most people's view, but the alternate lane, versus Rubio and Christie.  What should the American electorate think about when it comes to electability?PERINO:  One thing that comes from the discussion of the debate, which was able to meet the goal, they set out for.  I would say that one is Rubio.  He said himself aside.  If you say who the top three are, you take three dresses into the dressing room to try on like one, two, and three.  I would say Trump, Cruz and Rubio at this point.KELLY:  Does one of these make us look fat?PERINO:  That's the question -- when you put it on in front of the three- way mirror.  I always have to have everything hemmed.KELLY:  Do you think Rubio's got that lane secured?  So is it a three-man race or four-man race?PERINO:  I think Christie could surprise and do well in New Hampshire.  Can he do that?  I don't know.  He hired some people.  It is different groups leading up to it.  One of the most important groups we've talked about on your show is women.  And single women will make up 25 percent of the electorate in 2016.KELLY:  General electorate.PERINO:  General electorate.  Why is that important?  Because President Obama won women by 10 percent point, 55 to 44 percent in the general election, so if you look at something like Trump and Cruz they don't do that well with women.  They have some room to grow, I would say.  Rubio does a little bit better with women and that's an important one for him.  And another one to look out though of course is Hispanics.  If you look the match-up with Clintons and Hispanics, across the board, they are pretty good.KELLY:  What do you mean pretty good?PERINO:  For Clinton they are good.  In terms of Latinos for Clinton, versus Trump 69 percent to 27 percent, that's a huge difference.KELLY:  Isn't that what it wound up being for Romney?PERINO:  It is better for Clinton than even for Obama when it comes to Romney, because 43, President George W. Bush won 44 percent of Hispanics in 2004.KELLY:  Is that even possible?PERINO:  Romney won 27 percent.  It might not be possible.  But if they don't try they won't be close to winning a general election because of demographic changes.  It was estimated that Romney needed to win at least 35 percent of Hispanic vote to even hope to win general election...(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Trump, he doesn't do very well with women in the general electorate.  He doesn't do well with Hispanics in the general electorate.  But some say he's going to peel off some Democrats, unlike other candidates.  He's such a populist on certain issues, especially economic issues that he's going to pull off more Democrats than the other ways would.PERINO:  That is possibly true.  I met a woman last night in the hall who said do you want to talk to a former Democrat who became a Republican because I am supporting Trump?  I said sure.  That might be one of the ways Obama beat Clinton, brought new voters to the table.  If Trump can bring new voters, he can have a shot.KELLY:  Fascinating, 17 days to go until the first caucuses in the country in Iowa.  And we'll be there, Dana, great to see you.PERINO:  Thanks.KELLY:  There have been plenty of Powerball stories this week.  But this will make you feel -- you will -- you will cry in your soup.  Stay tuned for that.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  When a long-time nursing home employee learned she may have won it all in this week's Powerball, her colleagues and even her bosses suggested she could not be more deserving.  But in one of the most brutal, evil, awful twists we have seen this week, not only did this woman not win, she may have been pranked by a member of her own family.  Trace Gallagher has more from the west coast newsroom, Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER:  Megyn, the 62-year-old nurse got the Powerball ticket from her boss, who bought 18,000 tickets for all of his employees and residents at his many senior care facilities.  On the night of the drawing, the nurse's son sent her a cell phone picture of what he said was her winning ticket.  The nurse kept working, but as word got out, the nursing home started celebrating.  Then the whole party came crashing down when lottery officials got skeptical and anonymous sources started knocking down the claims.Turns out, the woman was pranked by her son, who thought it would be amusing to tell his mom that she was $528 million richer, funny, right?  Well, not so much for the rest of the nurse's family who called the prank embarrassing.  The owner of the nursing home called it despicable, but has now said he's offering a nice consolation prize.  Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Someone said this is a joke I would probably want you to let her know that I am going to get her an all-paid vacation wherever she wants to go.  Because this is -- this is one of those bad jokes.  Not funny.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  The nursing homeowner also offered to send her family along for the vacation, but something tells me only six of the seven kids will get invited.  So the so Cal winner is still a mystery, as is the Florida winner, a family in Mumford, Tennessee, claims to hold one of the winning tickets there.  And as soon as the Tennessee lottery makes it official, we'll make it official.KELLY:  Ah.  They have already been on TV but what proof is that?  Trace, great to see you, thank you, we'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Go to facebook.com/kellyfile file and let me know what you thought of tonight's show, and who you think won last night's debate.  Less than two weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses.  I am Megyn Kelly.  This is the Kelly File.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
