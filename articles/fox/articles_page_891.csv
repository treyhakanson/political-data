Flynn: We must not forget Orlando and San Bernardino	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" June 29, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, Fox News Channel learning details of a training unit that is specifically preparing Islamic State terrorists to carry out attacks on Western targets around the world, including the United States.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. Fox News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge learned some remarkable new details from her sources of the terror threat to the United States. She's with us here in moments. Ironically, this new reporting comes on the same day the director of the Central Intelligence Agency went on the record saying, he would not be surprised if we saw an Islamic State terror attack on the homeland just like the one we saw at one of Europe's busiest airports roughly 24 hours ago.Plus, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency is asking tonight why no one is talking about Orlando any longer. When the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11 happened just a couple of weeks ago, already we moved on. He is actually with us here tonight and we will hear from General Michael Flynn in moments.Plus, Congressman Peter King is here on the warnings from Director Brennan and what might happen before the end of Ramadan next week.But we begin tonight with reporting from our own Catherine Herridge live in Washington this evening. Catherine?CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, the U.S. government officials briefed on the intelligence says ISIS has as many as six terror cells whose only job is to train and armed terrorists outside Iraq and Syria. Today the CIA director said he would be surprised if ISIS wasn't targeting American airports.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: When individuals are trained to carry out these attacks, these so-called suicide attacks, that kill and maim so many people, they really don't have to worry about an escape route. It makes carrying out an attack so much easier.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: And tonight we're learning new details about the bombings, the sequence of events and the level of coordination with the first bomb going off outside the entrance to the international arrival's terminal. The second bomber detonates once inside the arrival's hall and the third inside the terminal itself. Once he was shot by security and unable to run.  Based on the 42 dead and more than 200 injured, a counterterrorism contact suggested the suicide vest use weapons grade explosives also pointed to the high number of shrapnel injuries and pock mark damage to the terminal.We saw a similar damage in the ISIS directed suicide attack in March at the Brussels airport. But the bombs appear to be totally different. In Brussels, they used suitcases packed with TATP which is an explosive made from materials you can buy at the hardware store. But it is highly unstable. This attack is having a clear direct impact on American airports. Visible security patrols today are increasing at the pick-up and drop-off zones and tonight homeland security is considering whether they need to expand the airport perimeter -- Megyn.KELLY: Catherine Herridge, thank you.HERRIDGE: You're welcome.KELLY: Joining me now to react, New York Republican Congressman Peter King, chairman of the subcommittee and counterterrorism and intelligence.  Congressman, good to see you here tonight.REP. PETER KING, R-N.Y.: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: So your information about the airport and CIA's director's admission that he would be surprise if ISIS is not targeting them.KING: Megyn, I'm not surprised at all. And I really want to give John Brennan credit. Because he seems to be the one voice in the administration that's telling the truth here. We should not at all be surprised that ISIS is planning attacks again the U.S. In fact, over a month ago, they called for attacks in Europe in the U.S. during Ramadan. And Ramadan still has 67 days to go. And listen ISIS fighters are trained. They are very much trained.And right now Director Comey probably has over 800 investigations going on in this country alone involving ISIS. So, we definitely have to be on our guard. And the fact is, we can move out the perimeter. We can have all of the security at the airport and we should. Don't get me wrong. But the fact is, the only way to stop these attacks is to stop them before they start and that requires intelligence, it requires surveillance, it requires monitoring, it requires having sources, undercovers, all that which the Obama administration didn't want to talk about.KELLY: We have heard talk of increasing, but we have heard it reported that they increase security at the airports in the New York and the New Jersey areas and now some are talking about changing the structure. Should we change the structure in this airport such as security, that the security lines we all have to go through with the magnetometers, should they be when you first get into the airport? I mean, is this likely to happen and is this just a comfort discussion, you know, as the cancer metastasizes?KING: Well, I think we have new technology. Looking at new perimeters.  Perhaps more use of guard dogs, and bomb inspection dogs. Also license readers and all that, all of technology and moving out the perimeter if we have to. But again, Megyn, if someone arrives at the airport and they have explosives, so they have AR-15 or an AK-47, odds are they will going to succeed. If they go to a subway station or shopping center, they will going to succeed. The only way that we have a real hope of stopping them is to stop before they start. And that requires a surveillance and the Obama people call it snooping and spying.KELLY: There is no support for that?KING: That's what we have to do.KELLY: There's not support for that. Or for Senator John McCain's push to expand the capability of the Feds to look at people's, suspected people's Facebook accounts and Twitter accounts. Things that wouldn't necessarily be made public?KING: Yes. And again, we are in time of war. And for instance, I believe that if that has been done with the shooter in Orlando we could have found out a lot more about him beforehand. Right now we are still treating 15 years later too many of these cases as ordinary law enforcement cases. And now you have General Flynn coming on. He is a real advocate to being aggressive. We're going to forward in this. We have to.This is not like going after a burglar or even going after a bank robber or murder. We are talking about going after an army that wants to kill us and has troops right here in our country and they are being investigated by the FBI. But again, we can't treat it as law enforcement. We have to be preemptive and go out and stop them and get them.KELLY: Congressman Peter King. Thank you, sir.KING: Megyn, thank you.KELLY: Well, our next guest spent more than three decades in the military, including more than ten years doing intelligence work. Eventually becoming the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency which is the sister to the CIA.General Michael Flynn is tonight asking why is the Obama administration was so quick to move on from Orlando. The worst attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. Less than three weeks after it happened.General Michael Flynn joins me now. He is also the author of the new book, ""The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies.""General, good to see you.GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN, AUTHOR, ""THE FIELD OF FIGHT"": Thanks for having me.KELLY: Why do you think that is? No one is talking about Orlando anymore.FLYNN: Yes. I'll tell you. So after the terrorist attack, this most recent terrorist attack in Turkey, you know, I'm paying very close attention to this entire problem that we are facing. And all of a sudden Orlando just drops off the screen. We barely, if anybody is even talking about San Bernardino. I feel bad. I'll bet you those people that lost loved ones, no one is even talking to them anymore. So, I mean, we have a problem as Congressman King just pointed out, we have a problem right here in our homeland.Turkey is another example of this radical ideology that we are facing and we must discredit this ideology. We can build all sorts of fences and security systems that we want but until we really go after the ideology, which is this radical Islamist ideology, Megyn, until we decide to do that, all the tactics in the world, all of the little things that we do around airports, that's just actually increases the cost and that is to the advantage of our enemy.KELLY: It just -- it doesn't feel like it doesn't --FLYNN: No.KELLY: It doesn't feel like it is doing anything other than the now comfort check.FLYNN: And actually every time they do one of these things, what it does is it increases the cost for our own security and we just can't afford to do this anymore. We must decide that, you know, internationally we have not really stated what our real strategy is, as America --KELLY: But wait -- but let me ask you about that. Because the Obama administration has made progress --FLYNN: No.KELLY: Yes, in Iraq.FLYNN: No.KELLY: We have taken back cities. They no longer control Fallujah.FLYNN: Yes.KELLY: They're on their heels. Now, Mosul is basically what they have --FLYNN: So, here is how people have to look at this. We have a very, very tactical strategy. Meaning it's very narrow, it's very sort of short term.  And we go after, we do these little attacks in Iraq, in Fallujah, in Raqqa, you know, in Ramadi and all of these little places. ISIS, they actually counterattack in San Bernardino, in Orlando, in Turkey, and actually in many other places.(CROSSTALK)I don't think in the last month -- Megyn, there's been over a thousand people killed and thousands wounded in just the last month.KELLY: But how do we stop that? Because you've heard President Obama, I mean, the administration sounds almost defeated when it comes to homegrown terror. Like, it is really hard. It's a needle in a haystack. It's actually a piece of hay that will ultimately become a needle and detecting that is nearly impossible.FLYNN: Right. Secretary Kerry and I think he did an unbelievable discredit to all of us in the United States. All Americans when he said, hey, you know, these, we can't really stop these things. These are going to continue to happen --KELLY: They are desperate. He said --FLYNN: Yes.KELLY: ISIS is desperate.FLYNN: Yes. I mean, come on! Are you kidding me? So we have to put up with this nonsense? No, we do not have to put up with this nonsense. The first thing that we have to do is we have to destroy what I would call the jihadist or the soldiers of this effort and we have to capture and kill their leadership. That can be done and that is done sort of locally in the Middle East and other parts of the Arab world. The Muslim, the radicalized Islamic world. The second thing, and actually, I still believe it's most important is we must discredit this ideology.Now, we also have to then warn, put out a warning to all of the nations around the world that are supporting these guys. And give them fair warning. You either support them or we're going to come in and get them from you. I mean, this is a very dramatic effort that we are going to have to put up with and I can't -- I'm not going to sit here and tell you that this is not going to be cheap and this is not going to come without violence. It is. But when we start -- when we continue to see the level of fear that's being increased, the level of cost that's being increased by these guys, I mean, the international community cannot stand for this type of behavior on an international stage like we have seen again and again and again.And here we have the President of the United States up in Canada talking about climate change. I mean, God, we just had the largest attack, as you just said, on our own soil in Orlando. Why are we talking about that? Who is talking about that? You know, I mean, Fort Hood, Chattanooga, Boston.  People forget about 9/11. I mean, and this is not about guns. They used planes, they used suicide bombs in Turkey, they used, you know, cylinders in Boston. So, we have a responsibility and we have to rebuild the trust between the American public and our federal government and our federal government has got to get its act together to go after these guys.KELLY: The normalization of this sort of homegrown domestic terror, if you will, is downright disturbing. General, I got to run. Great to see you as always.FLYNN: Okay. Great. Thank you.KELLY: Thank you, sir.Well, in the wake of yesterday's terror attack, people are starting to compare Donald Trump's response to that of President Obama. We will show you how those two stack up side by side, fair and balanced in a moment, when Chris Stirewalt and Dana Perino join us right after this break.Also, this Hillary Clinton tell-all from a former secret service officer is already the number two seller on Amazon. So, why is it getting so little media coverage? The author is here live.Plus, the Attorney General of the United States supposed to be leading a criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton. So why did she have a closed- door meeting today with Mrs. Clinton's husband? We, THE KELLY FILE, caught up with Attorney General Loretta Lynch and got to asked her. And she was not happy. Stay tuned for that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't believe that gives off the appearance of any impropriety while your agency is investigating his wife?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new fall out from the terror attack that left more than 40 dead and more than 200 injured at folks across the country now start to compare the reaction to these terrorists attack in Istanbul. The reaction from Donald Trump to that of the man he wants to replace, President Barack Obama. Take a look, and you decide.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Beyond killing innocents. They are continually losing ground.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They are spreading like wildfire. ISIS is spreading.  OBAMA: They are going to be on the run wherever they hide.TRUMP: They probably think we're weak, we're stupid.OBAMA: We will not rest until we have dismantled.TRUMP: So we can't do waterboarding. But they can do chopping off heads.OBAMA: We intend to do what is necessary to make sure that these kinds of terrible events are not happening.TRUMP: We have to fight so viciously and violently because we are dealing with violent people. Vicious people.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor and Dana Perino who is a former White House Secretary to George W. Bush and co-host of ""The Five."" Good to see you both. What a contrast, right? I mean, you take it Stirewalt.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, look, you could hardly find a greater study in contrast than the two points. Remember, the President, no drama Obama message is always, everything is fine. And it's normalizing. This is sort of the new normal. Sometimes there are terrorist attacks, sometimes no terrorist attacks, sometimes an ISIS state in Northern Iraq but things are fine. It's okay. Trump is, the world is exploding, everything is falling apart, and I'm going to kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. You couldn't be different. Couldn't be more different.KELLY: And the thing, the problem Dana for Hillary Clinton is, she will get associated with President Obama --DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": Yep.KELLY: -- whereas the people seem more in tune, at least in term of feelings, with Trump. Eighty four percent now say they are nervous about our nation's ability to prevent a terrorist attack. Eighty four percent.  Back in June 2005 it was just 50 percent.PERINO: What a troubling statistic. I mean, just forget it even who the president is at the moment but if you have 84 percent of people in America worried about their national safety, which is something they should not have to worry about because the federal government should be able to handle that, that is a problem. I also I feel like President Obama has the same exact language that he uses after all of these attacks. And if he says there is no existential threat against us one more time, it's going to drive me crazy because we just came off of Orlando.KELLY: Right.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: That's an existential threat. And I understand that he doesn't want us to worry all the time, he wants us to keep everybody calm. He is also trying to protect the narrative that he has done everything he can to keep us safe. Well, at the same time, Donald Trump is actually -- I don't think he is so much saying that I'm going to kill, kill, kill. It is that, I will be able to fight for you. We have to do something rather than just sitting here saying there is no existential threat.KELLY: Uh-hm. But the problem, Stirewalt with Trump's message is okay, so he is saying, I'm going to water board, I will do all of these things that we were not really allowed to do, right? The law has been changed such that we can't. And that's about as specific as he got. What we heard mostly from him was generalizations which led to this exchange. Here is Trump and then the exchange ahead with Mark Cuban on the program last night. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: There is something going on that's really, really bad. All right?  It's bad. And we better get smart and we better get tough.MARK CUBAN, ENTREPRENEUR: Whether it's Hillary or Donald, you can't just say this is bad, bad, very bad and we need to get tough. You know, at some point, both sides have got to dig in and start at least trying to come up with solutions.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: You tell me whether he is right.STIREWALT: Look, in 2008, if Barack Obama had a great opportunity, which comes rarely. You get to run as a challenger against, when a party is trying to keep the White House, this is why it is hard to keep the White House for three terms in a row for her own party, is that Barack Obama in 2008 could say I'm going to heal the earth and everybody will get ice cream cones.KELLY: But she did. She did say that.STIREWALT: I got mine. I got my ice cream cone.KELLY: And I don't remember the cones. But he did say he's going to heal the earth. This is the moment when the -- remember?STIREWALT: The earth would be healed. And though, ice cream I think would have gone further. But when you're running against an incumbent party in the White House, John McCain had to run as the incumbent and Barack Obama could promise everything. He could talk about George W. Bush's dumb war in Iraq. He could say he would fix it and it would be so smart. And that the real problem is that these dummies don't know how to do it and I'll do it right. That's a privilege and advantage that you get when you're running this way. Hillary Clinton has to run basically as an incumbent. Donald Trump can say anything. She can barely say anything at all.KELLY: Uh-hm. But the problem for him is that the rhetoric he has used in GOP primaries does not seem to play quite as well in the general election because the polls show that the American public preferred her response to the terror attack in Orlando to Donald Trump's.PERINO: Yes. And so now we have a situation where I think Mark Cuban is exactly right. Now that you know exactly sort of where they stand, that he says he would be more hawkish than she would be. Even though in her book she said that she wanted to do more in Syria but was overruled by Barack Obama. But Chris is right, she is stuck. Is he's Obama's third term that, you know, 56 percent of Democrats or 80 percent of Democrats think he is doing a great job.The rest of the country doesn't. So, she is in a box. That is absolutely true. But I think Mark Cuban is right. I would like to ask both the candidates, what specifically would you do differently from a strategic and tactical point of view from in your first 90 days in office? Because you are going to inherit this problem.KELLY: Right. Right. Task force. Something.PERINO: Well, and her --KELLY: And now we have a Congress -- one of home to see the fireworks, so we have been left unprotected. I mean, the President is in Canada and the Congress is watching the fireworks. Okay. What a shock. Eighty four percent think we're vulnerable to another attack. Panel, good to see you.PERINO: Thank you.STIREWALT: You bet.KELLY: Well, imagine how the debate would go if you put the victims of terror attacks and members of the military together with some Muslim activist and scholars. We just did that and it went a little like this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you can go love them and you stick your head in the sand and then when they come back and they kill your family, I'll be there to back you up.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: We've got that in moments.Plus, a former secret service officer stationed inside the Clinton White House is out now with shocking new allegations. He is here tonight to tell us why he thinks the media is largely ignoring his story.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, 42ND PRESIDENT: I did not have sexual relations with that woman. Ms. Lewinski.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER: From the World's Headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: Well, you just heard Lieutenant General Michael Flynn say that if we really want to combat and defeat ISIS, it's going to be violent. Well, some do not see that as an answer. Earlier, we assembled the powerful panel unlike any we have ever had. Among those present, terror attack survivors from Orlando. And from Fort Hood. First responders including the woman who shot Nidal Hasan in Fort Hood. Those on the left and the right and members of the Muslim community. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: After all of the wars that we fought, after all of the Iraqis that had been killed in the name of the United States of America since 1991, all of the blood that's been spilled, no doubt heroically, we are still no safer. So maybe we should start to think of ways of dealing with this that does not directly involve killing more people or having more wars. Crazy liberal ideas, I know.KELLY: Okay. I have to let a veteran respond to that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, the problem is that ISIS sprung up when we stopped going in the area and we stopped killing bad guys in the area. So, you can go love them and you stick your head in the sand and when they come back and kill your family, I'll be there to back you up.KELLY: We shouldn't be giving the impression that because those in this room who are willing to say, radical Islam is at war with the United States, that's condemnation of Islam. You know, that seems to be a false choice that others impose. Why can't you have both ideas in your head?  That Islam is a peace-loving religion. And but that it can be corrupted to a place where it is political and it's radical and it's dangerous. Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know, when the Tea Party was up and coming, they had no problems throwing out, you know, throwing the Tea Party and calling them racist and go, why can't they call it what it is? How do you fight something that you can't call out? You need to call it out. You need to stop thinking about the kumbaya and your bumper sticker is bleeding all over the place, so spare me.KELLY: Kimberly, go ahead. Go ahead, Kimberly.KIMBERLY MUNLEY, FORT HOOD POLICE SERGEANT: I completely agree with you.  Because we toss up the word talk about political correctness. Well, I'm sorry, that's the problem. Because we exclude his pledge to ISIS during the attack. We exclude Hasan being able to go up and his own free will and announce his pledge to, at the time, with the Taliban, and then he switched over to ISIS, whatever is the going factor at the time. And we suppress that information. That information is not put out to the public. Because it is politically sensitive.KELLY: What do you think of the push on guns, I'm curious?MUNLEY: The push on guns is a whole different story. They can throw that out there on every serious, you know, terrorist attack out there. That's not the problem. He was on a watch list. He shouldn't have been able to buy a weapon. That is plain and simple. But that's not the solution.  Because they are going to get the weapons. They are going to get the -- whatever the pressure cookers. Whatever they want to get to accomplish the goal.KELLY: Go ahead. I've got to go, but you go ahead, sir.ALONZO LUNSFORD, RETIRED STAFF SERGEANT, FORT HOOD SURVIVOR: Where the problem lies is that we look at our future leaders. Just like they say that these kids don't have anything to look to, our administration has failed. Because the economics, because of how they're teaching our kids.  They are spending more time teaching our kids to pass integrated tests than they are teaching about the values that will make this country great.Then when someone said that the Islamics, when they're going to kill people, they are only looking for Muslim to kill, when we got hit. Major Hasan didn't ask those 14 people that died that day, if you were Muslim, if you were Christian, if you were Jewish, whatever. He just started shooting and said, Allahu Akbar.And even when we was having the trial, the man said, inshallah, it's God's will. We got to call it what it is because you got grab the stick by the head and you got to kill it and you cannot do it nice. I've never seen anybody win a fight by fighting nice. You've got to change the rules of engagement because as a military personnel here, we've been here and we've done that. It is hard when you see somebody making an IED and you can't take a person out because you have to get permission from higher-ups. That's the snake right there.As far as guns are concerned, I'm a dad and I'm a school teacher. When I went down, my son -- I'm a single father therefore my son clinging (ph) to my arm (inaudible) dad, from now on if you should fall, I will step up. He knows how to operate everything in my arsenal and that's how it's going to be. Yes, you have to fight fire with fire.(Applause)KELLY: Extraordinary. And we have much more from that panel. Tune in to ""The Kelly File"" special ""Terror in America"" this Friday at 9:00. And trust me, you do not want it miss this.Up next, former Secret Service Officer Gary Byrne is here with a first-hand account of the scandals he says he saw play out in the Clinton White House.Plus, if Attorney General Loretta Lynch is leading a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton, why was she today meeting with Mrs. Clinton's husband? Former DOJ attorney Jay Christian Adams is here on why this does not look so good. Plus, we'll show you what happened when ""The Kelly File"" cornered Lynch with some hard questions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't believe that that gives off the appearance of any impropriety while your agency is investigating his wife?  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, the Department of Justice is leading criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's State Department e-mails and possibly the Clinton Foundation but that did not keep Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former president Bill Clinton from having a cozy private meeting on her plane this week.Ms. Lynch said the meeting was unplanned and the investigations never came up but legal experts say it looks bad. And Fox News producer Dan Gallo cornered Miss Lynch on behalf of ""The Kelly File"" on that very question this afternoon. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LORETTA LYNCH, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: He did come over and say hello and speak to my husband and myself and talked about his grandchildren and his travels and things like that. So that was the extent of that. And no discussions were held on any cases or anything of that and he didn't raise anything about that either.DAN GALLO, FOX NEWS FIELD PRODUCER: You don't believe that that gives the appearance of any impropriety while you're agency is investigating his wife?LYNCH: My agency is involved in a matter of looking at State Department policies and issues. It's being handled by career investigators and career agents who always follow the facts and law and do the same thorough and independent examination in this matter that they've done in all. So that's how that will be handled. Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, former DOJ attorney Jay Christian Adams, Chris good to see you tonight. So, was this inappropriate that they had -- their planes were at the airport and he came on over to her plane?JAY CHRISTIAN ADAMS, FORMER DOJ ATTORNEY: Loretta Lynch is the individual, Megyn, who's going to decide ultimately whether or not to send to the grand jury a recommendation to indict Hillary Clinton for keeping a private server in Bill Clinton's basement. And so this is extremely bad judgment. Bill Clinton might be a witness. You know, Loretta Lynch said something there as very important.She said that career people follow the facts and the law. They'll also follow her lead. And her lead is that she's buddies with Bill Clinton. They know that the goal post is that much smaller for them to get a recommendation to go to an indictment. So, this is very bad for her to do this.KELLY: It was interesting to hear her say what they didn't talk about. First she said we talked a great deal about his grandchildren, primarily about social items in our travels and then she said there was no discussion of any pending matter before the department. No discussion of Benghazi. No discussion of the State Department e-mail.She did not mention the Clinton Foundation which Bill Clinton has been very involved in. And it raises the question of what exactly she left out in her description and what was his motivation of in going in that plane and talking to her.ADAMS: Yeah, well his motivation, you can never know. But the problem is that this has the appearance of impropriety. Attorneys general are supposed to be above this sort of nonsense. You didn't see this sort of behavior from Michael McCasey and other attorneys general, both Democrat and Republican. They would never get within arm's length of a target of a criminal investigation and a potential witness or a family member of that target.That's not what you do. Notice how she also down played the DOJ role like we're looking into State Department policies. That's the same nonsense that the Hillary campaign has been saying and James Comey, the director of the FBI blatantly contradicted.KELLY: Exactly right. Hillary Clinton came out and said -- how did she put it -- it was just, oh, it's a policy review, it's a policy review. And James Comey came out and said I don't even know what that is. We investigate criminal cases. We're the FBI.But listen, in her defense and Bill Clinton's defense, isn't it possible that with the former president of the United States, he is not just any husband. He is former president of the United States, that he would meet with dignitaries like this and officials like this just to glad hand.ADAMS: Absolutely. But people are not trusting Washington institutions. People are not trusting beltway insiders. It's growing in skepticism around the country. And people are wondering, why has this not gone to a grand jury? For what we know about it, a county D.A. could probably get a conviction in this case. She is keeping classified information on a home brew server in her basement. So this has all the wrong messages to an increasingly skeptical America about the institutions in Washington, D.C.KELLY: That is a question about what was in her head in terms of the intent that they will be looking into as well. Chris, great to see you.ADAMS: You too, Megyn.KELLY: So, the Clintons are also the subject of an explosive new tell-all book written by a former Secret Service officer who protected the first family at the White House. That officer, Gary Byrne, said he witnessed signs of physical altercations, alleged drug abuse among staffers and multiple mistresses on the part of then President Bill Clinton.Now he says a volcanic Mrs. Clinton is unfit, in his view, for the presidency. Joining me now is Gary Byrne, the author of ""Crisis of Character."" Gary, thank you very much for being here. So, how close did you get to the Clintons when they were in the White House?GARY BYRNE, FORMER SECRET SERVICE OFFICER: Megyn, when I worked at the White House as a Secret Service uniformed division officer, I was -- one of my posts was the oval office post right outside the oval office. And I was stationed there for approximately three years. And I saw the first family, the president especially, and all the senior staff every day.KELLY: Now, you talk about she had some salty language and...BYRNE: Sure.KELLY: ...you know said things not just to him but to Secret Service agents that you didn't much appreciate.BYRNE: Yes.KELLY: But you know, was that worst of it? Or I mean, was it sort of, you allege some physical abuse. Was it only towards Bill Clinton and was it after his affairs?BYRNE: Well the physical abuse that we never, I guess we will be talking about is one morning, the president showed up at the oval office with black mark under his eye, a black eye that they were trying to conceal with make- up. And the night before there had been a bad argument upstairs in the private living quarters. And I heard this when I came in that morning -- the next morning. Supposedly when they were having this argument there was a crash.When it was investigated later on there was a broken vase. Now, this story I know has been reported as a lamp or whatever. I saw the vase. After I was told what happened, I walked down to the curator's office on the ground floor of the White House and inside the curator's office was a small cardboard box with the blue vase, mostly blue and a little bit white. And you know, that told you that there was something happening and it got broke.KELLY: Well, what about -- one of the allegations is that she was abusive, she was a foul-mouth and abusive to her protective detail. Throwing a bible at one agent and driving many others to alcohol and hookers? Now, come on. She drove the Secret Service to hookers? Come on.BYRNE: No. So, basically what I'm saying is that the extra pressure that was put on employees there, the Secret Service officers and agents, yes they did make some mistakes for their behave your. I'm not saying it's her fault. I'm saying that when you treat people like that -- now picture yourself, Megyn...KELLY: They are Secret Service guys. I mean, they're tough. They don't go see a hooker because of the first lady's foul mouth.BYRNE: So, put yourself in their place. You're a Secret Service who's risking your life to protect them. You're sitting in the limousine and for whatever reason, the first lady has a fit, she takes a bible and hits you in the back of the head with it. That's not normal behavior. Would you accept that behavior where you work now? No, you wouldn't, nobody would.And these are things that happen -- it didn't happen every day but it happened quite a bit. If you take all the scandals that the Clintons were involved in, Megyn, you couldn't put them all on two pieces of paper single-spaced. It's incredible.KELLY: You know that -- you know that superiors of yours, the president of the Association of Former Agents at the Secret Service said you were too low ranking to have witnessed everything you claim. They say you could be on the presidential detail for decades and not rack up the number of scenes that you claim that you saw.BYRNE: So, here's the thing, Megyn. I was never on the presidential protection details. I was part of the uniformed division. The uniformed division works fixed post in the White House. Those fixed posts have been there for over 50 years. They never moved. I was where I said I was and the story that I'm telling you is the story of my life. One of the reasons I'm telling it is because you I want my kids know their father did the right thing when he was supposed to.KELLY: Well, the last thing Gary and this is-- this isn't me impugning you. I just want to read the allegation in front of me.  BYRNE: Sure. That's fine.KELLY: But BuzzFeed is reporting that your story in the book, you claim in the book that you saw lipstick and President Clinton's semen on towels that were brought to you by a steward. You claim in your book you removed the towels from the White House grounds and you disposed of them.BYRNE: I did. Put them in a grocery bag.KELLY: But BuzzFeed has reported that under oath you testified during the Ken Starr investigation in the Monica Lewinski case, and there you said the steward just showed you the towels, said something about lipstick and you testified you didn't see any of the stains and that the steward kept them and you don't know what he did with them, that's what you said under oath. And that was the end of it. So, two very different stories. How do you explain the discrepancy?BYRNE: Well, it's very simple Megyn. There were different incidences. At one time, they were talking tissues and another time they were talking about towels. Now, as you will know as a lawyer, it's not my job to steal (ph) her investigation. If that's what they were locked onto -- you have to put yourself in my position. At that time, we had many roles.We couldn't just go in and tell them the truth. Anything involving the president, we couldn't talk about and rules change weekly. The truth is, the only reason these uniform division officers like myself were being compelled to testify and -- was because the Secret Service basically pushed us forward to the executives of the Secret Service who knew everything that Judge Starr wanted wouldn't have to testify themselves.KELLY: I understand.BYRNE: So, that's the only reason I was ever involved in it. Bill Clinton's bad behavior and then because of the Secret Service pushing us forward. Everything in my book Megyn is true. That's my life.KELLY: Gary, thank you for being here. I appreciate it.BYRNE: Thank you so much. I appreciate it.KELLY: Joining me now with a response, Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky. Julie, what did you make of it?JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, it is not what I make of it. It's what his former superiors make of it. They say it's complete nonsense, and what I just heard is incredibly startling to me. He is saying under oath he couldn't tell the truth?KELLY: He is saying I didn't control what they asked me about. They asked me about one issue involving a towel or a tissue and the other thing involved the other item.  ROGINSKY: Well, but except for the fact that he now is saying he witnessed this and then under oath he essentially said that this is a rumor he heard from Bill Clinton's steward. Look, he was so low ranking he was on the -- according to Secret Service agents who actually were part of the presidential protection unit, he would have been outside the very edge of the perimeter. He was never close enough to the first lady or to the president.KELLY: But then that same -- that same president of the Association of Former Agents and Secret Service came out and said ""well, there could be a circumstance where uniformed officer might be in the proximity. It's not as if it never happens. It is possible.""ROGINSKY: Well, it's possible once. Is it possible for the complete compilation of stories he's developed? I mean, this is somebody who obviously hung out in the map room with Bill Clinton according to him, enough to witness him having multiple fairs over and over again? Once okay, twice okay, three?KELLY: He said he saw three -- I think he said he saw or four affair partners.ROGINSKI: According to the Secret Service or the retired (ph) Secret Service Association, he never would not have been allowed to be within approximation of the president enough to witness anything he said. That is not my saying, it's the former -- his former bosses and people who know.KELLY: Julie, thank you, ma'am.ROGINSKY: Thanks very much.KELLY: So, several big names came out today with pronouncement that not only will Hillary Clinton win in November but she will sweep with an epic landslide. Others say, not so fast. David Wohl and Stewart Stephens,on the polls and the predictions, next.(COMMERCIAL BRAK)KELLY: New reaction tonight through multiple predictions piling up that presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton will win this November in a landslide. A brand new Fox poll is out tonight showing Mrs. Clinton with a 6 point lead. Statistician Nate Silver and President Obama's 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe and Frontloading HQ's Josh Putnam to name a few are all pointing to a big Clinton win. They say she'll have a comfortable sweep of the Electoral College.Joining me now with the response to that, David Wohl, attorney and Trump supporter and Stuart Stevens who's author of the new political thriller out today ""The Innocent Have Nothing To Fear."" Political thriller with striking similarities to the 2016 race, the innocents have nothing to fear, the guilty too. We'll talk more with Stuart about that some time. Okay. So, it's over David. I mean, I don't know why you're bothering to support Donald Trump because it can take the ""L"" out of lover because it is over.DAVID WOHL, TRUMP SUPPORTER: Get the heck out of here. You know, I analyzed that poll, that Fox News poll really closely today, Megyn. And here are some interesting facets about it. Among those interested in the race and I submit to you this year, that's a huge number of people. They are virtually even.Clinton is up by 2 percentage points within the margin of error. And guess what, those people are going to be categorized as likely voters. Among independents, Donald Trump is up 8 percent. That's huge, Megyn, and that is closely in line with the Quinnipiac poll that also came out today that has trump -- basically they're even, Clinton 42, Trump 40.And critically important, that poll has Donald Trump polling higher in the economy, terrorism, leadership, and honesty. And in this critical time in our history, Megyn, we're being attacked left and right by this radical Jihadis. I don't know what could be more important. That's huge. I'm not writing him off at all. I think he is going to win.KELLY: What do you think, Stuart?STUART STEVENS, ROMNEY CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST: You know, politics is all about probability and what Nate Silver is saying when he says to 80/20 is, that there's a greater probability that Hillary Clinton will win. I think every bit of evidence points to that. It's not to say that Donald Trump can't win. Of course he can win.KELLY: What statistic backs that up in your mind? Just a poll like the Fox News poll in which she's six points ahead of him?STEVENS: Well, that she's most likely to win?KELLY: Yeah.STEVEN: There is sort of two big warning signs out there I think for Donald Trump. One is that he is yet to coalesce Republicans. You need to get both, whether or not you're a Democrat or Republican, you need to get over 90 percent of support from your own party. Trump hit a high water mark of 82 and now he slipped into the mid 70's.KELLY: He's 74 now.STEVEN: Yeah, that's not something you can't fix...KELLY: Romney had 93 percent.STEVEN: Yeah, which is pretty standard really, frankly. You have to really get that to be in the game. The other thing that would bother me if I was Donald Trump guy is his seeming inability to get much over 40 percent in any of these polls. It's been a long time since he has been north of 40 in a poll.And that, I think, is tied to two factors. His high unfavorability, somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of the country has unfavorable view of him, which just makes him hard to recruit new customers. It's like he's getting bad online reviews. And the second thing is the fact that Democrats right now have a generic advantage over Republicans so that's pulling Trump up better than roughing (ph) him up.KELLY: The thing is, David, you know, everyone knows Hillary. And you tell me whether Trump could change those numbers with some sort of presidential behavior?WOHL: I think he can change the numbers just from the behavior that he exhibits every day, Megyn, because people like him because is he not a politician. Because he does lead. Because he does understand the greatest threat we face, this existential threat of global Islamic terrorism and people like the way is he dealing with it and honestly, your last guest, Mr. Adams, the attorney analyzing this e-mail situation, there is one thing we are forgetting.I mean, Loretta Lynch's boss has endorsed Bill Clinton. She needs to step aside so that an independent prosecutor can come in. When that happens, Hillary Clinton will be questioned. I think she'll take the Fifth Amendment. If she does that, that's a catastrophic event for her campaign.The whole thing could be done with at that point. So, there is so many x factors here we're not really considering, but Donald Trump right now, Megyn, he's making -- he's scoring huge points because of how the way he deals with terrorism.KELLY: Got to leave it at that. Okay. Got to go. Out of time. Good luck. See you soon. We'll be right back.WOHL: See you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: The innocent have nothing to fear. What do you think? Hillary Clinton? Yes or no.

6	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/04/12/hillary-clinton-new-york-city-mayor-under-fire-for-racially-charged-joke/	Hillary Clinton, New York City mayor under fire for racially charged joke	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" April 12, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hello, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Jedediah Bila, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, and Melissa Francis -- ""The Five.""Watching leftists tell jokes is like watching a rat give birth... in your kitchen.MELISSA FRANCIS, CO-HOST: Ugh!(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thanks for the endorsement, Bill. Took you long enough.(APPLAUSE)NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: Sorry, Hillary. I was running on CP Time.'HAMILTON' ACTOR LESLIE ODOM JR.: That's not -- I don't like jokes like that, Bill. That's not...CLINTON: Cautious Politician Time.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: People think surgery is painful to watch? No, that was painful to watch. That was harder to watch than ""Zoolander II."" The punch line: Instead of referring to colored people, CP meant cautious politician. The mayor is as funny as rigor mortis. It would have been better if he said corrupt politician, callous putz or cadaverous pothead. His head is shaped like a pot, you know.But the joke went over as well as the invasion of Libya. Maybe Hillary can blame this on a video, too. But the left reaps what they sow. They create the hypersensitive fish bowl we live in now and when they poop in it, they deserve the wrath from all sides. But I'm sure they thought the joke was fine because the black guy was in on it. But if the Republicans have done this, the left would have called that guy an Uncle Tom.Yes, the joke was bad, but there's worse. Like New York under de Blasio. Another great city stained by fiendish slashings, homeless hell and graft. It is like de Blasio found an old copy of ""Death Wish"" and thought, ah, the good old days.So the joke is not the CP line, it's this mayor and that we continue to elect these progressives to great cities only to see under their rule savagery return in an ugly, bloody, fury. The joke isn't on blacks. It is on all of us. And it is one that never seems to die.Juan, you're black.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Yeah, yeah.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: You unleashed on that one.GUTFELD: Yeah. I can't stand it. How bad was that joke in your mind? Was it bad?WILLIAMS: No. In fact, what was interesting today was the number of white people who said to me, what's CP Time?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: That's so common. You know, what it could be is someone said, my age. That it is a generational thing, that it was much more common before. But gosh, I hear that all the time.GUTFELD: You do? Still?WILLIAMS: Because I'm late all the time.(CROSSTALK)ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: And I'm being 100 percent, I've never heard it before. And I'm trying to figure, is it the C part of it or the part that it is basically saying African-Americans are late? Or is it all of it? It is just offensive across the board?WILLIAMS: I didn't think it was that. I thought it was an inside joke. It's like people saying manana, you know, if you're in Latin America. It is like oh, yeah, they always come tomorrow. I mean, it is like a funny thing. The only part is if he said colored people.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Is it still that offensive.WILLIAMS: It's not offensive to me. I just thought it was old-fashioned. And of course, I thought Greg was on target. Look, you have a black actor there. That black guy had been in on a conservative joke, he would have, Greg is honest.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Mayor de Blasio is married to an African-American.WILLIAMS: What?BOLLING: Even though he is married to an African-American.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: That's not your get out of jail card.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Right. But it's comedy.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I'm asking. I don't know. Because a lot of times the things that I said that are offensive by comedians, or if you say that at a table like this.WILLIAMS: You're apologizing for it.MELISSA FRANCIS, CO-HOST: I think the problem with it was that it wasn't actually funny. He should be offended as a comedian, not as you know an African-American person. It wasn't funny. It is like racist jokes. It is like joking about rape. It is just not funny. So I don't know why -- I don't know who wrote the joke, I don't know who told them to do it, when they were standing out there, how did they go, this is a great idea. Let's do this.GUTFELD: That's the thing. I'm wondering Jedediah, how did that get into the script? Why does it bother me more than it bothers Juan? CP is a joke about colored people.JEDEDIAH BILA, CO-HOST: Yeah. It is hard to offend me. I actually think comedy, good comedy, should offend you. I like when I'm in an audience, when I'm watching a comedy show, and it makes me uncomfortable. I think it makes me of laugh. It is hard to offend me. With that being said, with his delivery, I mean, nothing could be funny but I don't think it is a greatly executed joke. But there should be a different set of standards, I think for comedians. If we were sitting at this table and we were saying something like that, we're not aiming to be funny about it. We would be talking about news. Comedians get on stage and they're supposed to sort of rub you the wrong way, or ruffle you up a little bit.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I disagree. I don't think you're allowed to have kind of immunity bubble because you're a comedian. All of this should have the immunity bubble. If you screw up, you screw up. I don't think that because you're on stage, that allows you to be.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I thought it was, the phrase itself is offensive. I think it is.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Is it the phrase or the innuendo that African-Americans are late all the time? Which one is it?FRANCIS: It's the same thing.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: So I like comedy that pushes the line.FRANCIS: Me, too.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: And explodes stereotypes, and plays -- contradicts what you perceive about race or gender politics, sexual politics. I like that. But the problem with this is it wasn't that funny. It was funny in the sense that, guess what, they're willing to push the line on a racial issue. And people like de Blasio, Hillary Clinton, those two would never do it.GUTFELD: You know what it is? It is because we know they would destroy us. They would destroy us.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Generally, I mean, we talked about the First Amendment. We talked about it, that we should be able to make a joke and laugh about it. We don't mean any harm. But we can't because of the divide. On the left, there's an acceptable norm. On the right, it is completely different.WILLIAMS: Like a Chris Rock, right? Chris Rock talks about that. So we're having a great time and then certain people, I'm not going to say that word. I don't even say it in my private life. Certain people show up and we're talking about a substandard black of people. And he starts using that N word, right.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: And everybody in the audience is howling with laughter. Because this is among black people, right.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: Now, do you get a get out of jail card for Chris Rock, a black comedian using that word?GUTFELD: Why is it a get out of jail card?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: The colored part is now considered racist, right?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: That's where we have a disconnect right now.GUTFELD: No, no, no. You have de Blasio explaining the joke, that we have been talking about. Let's have him explain it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DE BLASIO: It was clearly a staged show, it was a scripted show. And the whole idea was to do the counter intuitive and say Cautious Politician Time. Every actor involved including Hillary Clinton and Leslie Odom, Jr. thought it was a joke on a different convention. That was the whole idea of this. I think people are missing the point here.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So it's our fault.FRANCIS: What is a joke on an another convention? Did you see her face? She was like no.(CROSSTALK)BILA: Imagine Ted Cruz had made that joke and then went on television and explained that it way. And imagine the response that he would get. People would be outraged. But because it is de Blasio, they were like oh, OK, he meant no harm. That's the problem, that there is a huge disparity between -- it is acceptable for some people to offend in a certain way and not for others.FRANCIS: It would be acceptable to me for either of them to do the jokes.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Come on, two days ago, another homeless guy slashed an Israeli tourist. And this is happening a lot. The homeless rate has risen from something like 20,000 from like 15,000 over two years. The city is returning to the year of taxi driver. It really is.BILA: That's true. In other words, you think that when people make mistakes, people should him accountable for that?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: He is doing more harm that way, with him and his lousy jokes. That joke really didn't hurt anybody.FRANCIS: Instead of practicing the joke, maybe he should go and mayor the city is your point.GUTFELD: Yeah exactly. Maybe show up on time. We talk about this new poll? Race tension is at a 15-year high, high literally. Risen the latter half of the Obama presidency, 35 percent are worried about racial relations. That's up 17 percent from 2014. Juan, who do you think is to blame? Do you think it is partially Obama? Do you think it is partially the media? Do you think it is academia, which in my mind has turned race into a major?WILLIAMS: Well, you know what you got to do, it is dig into the numbers. Because what was interesting to me is guess who really have seen a jump in terms of their concern about race relations? It is liberals, not conservatives. And guess what, it's white people, not black people. So why do we see the large jump in the last two-year period? And I think it has to do with things like you know, Black Lives Matter, the police and poor black people, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and all that kind of stuff. And people are feeling freer I think to speak about it. And then you get a black president who again involved, and sometimes people say he is reckless in terms of what he has to say about it. But I think you have more freedom from black and Latinos, who will say for the first time, you know what, I'm concerned about something like this.BILA: I think the media plays a big role in terms of what we choose to cover. We cover stories that you know, if there's black on white violence or white on black violence, that gets amplified for some reason. But if you have black on black violence in the city of Chicago, people are shot every day, they are shot everyday within the black community. Within the white community, that has nothing to do with race. That has for some reason isn't an interesting angle or an interesting story. And I think we selectively sometimes blow up stories. And then it taints a picture for the country of a racial reality that may or may not be the case. But it amplifies certain things at the expense of others. So media absolutely has a role. I don't think the president just because he is African-American, I don't think Barack Obama would change the entire dynamic of race relations in this country. Even though he said he would be a great unifier and maybe people said you didn't do what you said you are going to do, he is one man. He cannot change everything. You need local communities.(CROSSTALK)BILA: We need families to come together. This is an issue that all of us have to work together.GUTFELD: He did say he would change the levels of the oceans.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Let's also not forget when President Obama who clearly said he came out on race, if I had a son, he would look like Trayvon Martin. That was dramatic. That was a dramatic comment. It could have just been hey, he's just weighing in on it. He also had Eric Holder, remember Eric Holder during I believe it was Trayvon Martin as well said, talking about when he was a young African-American boy with his father walking in a department store, security would follow them around. I mean, the Obama administration has perpetuated or has heightened the race debate over the last six years. And I don't think it has gotten better. I think it has gotten worse according to that poll.WILLIAMS: Do you think it is worse because you heard that?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Why am I hearing President Obama weighing in that his son would look like Trayvon Martin? I'm not really understanding.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Because he is saying, with this kid, he felt was under fairly attacked and it had to do with race. Young black boys wearing a hoodie?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And the problem is there are so many occurrences of crime as Jedediah points out.BILA: Right.BOLLING: He chose that to weigh in on, which was heightening the racial tensions in America.FRANCIS: But she's right when she says it is about the media. Because we cover things that are out of the ordinary, that's what makes it news. So if there is black on black violence in Chicago every day, by definition, a lot of times it is not covered because it happens everyday. So it doesn't sound like news. It gives you from the outside a skewed perspective on what's going on.GUTFELD: The tragedy of the mundane, the mundane of the tragedy. That's true.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: We got so used to this stuff.FRANCIS: Right.GUTFELD: All right. Ahead on The Five, Ted Cruz' wife gives her first TV interview since Trump retwitted that photo, mocking her appearance. Megyn Kelly got an exclusive with Heidi Cruz. Hear what she thought about that infamous posting coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Bernie Sanders is convinced that America's economy is rigged.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BERNIE SANDERS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is not only a corrupt campaign finance system, it is a rigged economy. The Walton family who owns Wal- Mart, one family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people. The Walton family pays wages so low to its employees at Wal-Mart that many of the workers are forced to go on food stamps and Medicaid. Do you know who pays higher taxes for those food stamps and Medicaid? That's exactly right, the middle class does.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And the Walton's. He also mentioned his goal of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. But wouldn't the government be rigging the economy and hurting the poor with that kind of wage hike. And we will discuss. Melissa.FRANCIS: Either one.BOLLING: Either one, take the first one or the second one. Tell us about $15 an hour.FRANCIS: OK. So I had (inaudible) White Castle on yesterday. And he was talking about the $15 minimum wage which would impact him here in New York City, where they have 30 restaurants, which are by the way, owned by the franchisees who are small business owners. They said to get to $15 an hour. They have a 1 to 2 percent profit margin. They have to raise prices 50 percent in order to pay them or they have to fire people or they have to automate. There is no profit margin that these rich guys at the top are taking home. It is just about hurting the people at the bottom, hurting the customers and firing workers. That's how you get the $15 an hour. As for the rigged economy, yes, it is rigged. It is rigged by everyone in Washington. The Federal Reserve -- I mean, their easy money policy has jacked the stock market during this recovery. That's why the divide has gotten bigger and the rich have in fact gotten richer. I mean, they had housing through hud (ph). That's why the bubble exploded in the real estate. I mean, all the externalities in the economy that go on and blow up are from Washington.BOLLING: Talk about the Walton family. They employ a lot of people.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: And they provide the cheap goods for the people that Bernie Sanders claims to be worried about. They make life livable. By the way, what system is he comparing America to? Is there some kind of utopian socialist nirvana in Neptune that he somehow missed out? There's no system of government that has reduced poverty more than America's system, across the board. The poor in America is better off than the middle class in most countries. They have more goods, they have more services. Life is better. The idea of poverty is being reduced faster and America is doing it on its own.BOLLING: And, Juan, let's take a listen, $15 minimum wage would kill jobs and business. The former CEO of McDonald's.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ED RENSI, FORMER MCDONALD'S CEO: Talk about going from $10 up to $15 for a new minimum, you're talking about a 50 percent increase in wages. You look at that. Small businesses are going to get crucified with these rules. I know it is a job killer. If you go back and look at the volume of a typical fast food restaurant 25 years ago and the number of employees they have, the head count is down 50 percent in these restaurants.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And I want to mention, now, you can put an order in to McDonald's. They'll send to it India and send it back to that McDonald's.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It is cheaper.WILLIAMS: Let me just say, I'm amazed that Ed Rensi is saying -- talking about small businesses as if McDonald's is a small business. I don't think they are a small business at all.BOLLING: The franchise, the individual stores.WILLIAMS: I think that you've seen Target and others raise their minimum wage and trying to get out ahead of what is now a political movement, especially on the left in this country, Democratic candidates. It is not only Bernie. I think Bernie wants to raise it to $15 an hour. But Hillary Clinton wants to do it for 12. President Obama is talking about 10-10. This is all a percentage of I think it is 17-40, it is the minimum wage in the country. So you're talking, when you get to 15, you're about 85 percent there. That destroys the market for people who are trying to just make a living.BOLLING: What do you think Jedediah?BILA: I think somebody pays for it. Bernie Sanders talks as if money just grows on trees. You're going to pay for it in terms of your prices. Prices are going to go up. You are going to pay for it in terms of people getting laid off. He does -- to answer Greg's question before, he does live in a utopia. And it is created in his own mind where everybody gets you know rainbow, a unicorn, some cookies at the end of the day. Somebody else is paying for everything. I find it really interesting when he speaks about corruption, government can never be corrupt. Like somehow government somehow is going to roll in and be this great equalizer and take from one person and give to another and balance out the whole system. And all the corruption is going to leave as if there's never been a story about government corruption. It is fascinating to me that corruption for him only exists in the private sector. And government is somehow holier than thou in his utopia.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Wait a second, wait a second. Your argument and Melissa's argument seems of a part to me. Because you say oh, the excess comes from Washington.FRANCIS: Yeah, I think it is the policies in Washington that got us into this mess in the first place. I mean, you look at the Federal Reserve putting moment out there, easy money. I mean, you like to talk about the bubble, housing, and the stock market -- the bubble last time around.WILLIAMS: Yeah.FRANCIS: I mean, this is low interest rates pumped out there where people are reaching for yields, so they're taking the crazy risks and breaking the law.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But who did that, Melissa? It seems to me Wall Street was banking financial instruments that were high risk, and when they fail, then they bail us out. We're too big to fail.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: No, it is because the Federal Reserve has interest rates too low. You go all the way back to Allen Greenspan and you look at how much money, low interest rates were pumped into housing, where people thought they lied on their loans, and they went out and bought houses, and thought it would go up and up forever, because that was a great way to make money. That was facilitated by the Federal Reserve, by Washington, D.C.WILLIAMS: I get it. I get it.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: And the people in Wall Street had nothing to do with pushing that.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: I am saying there is plenty of blame to go around. And it starts in Washington. Yes, there were bad actors that broke the law. Absolutely. And there are also really bad actors in Washington and there were bad individuals who lied on their loans.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: That's why Bernie Sanders is doing so well. Because people are saying, listen. This ain't right.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Why do you take care of Wall Street but never take care of Main Street?BILA: He is doing so well because he talks in sound bites that are appealing.GUTFELD: He's never taken care of Main Street either, Juan.WILLIAMS: I don't think so.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: We will leave it right there. Donald Trump still fired up about the presidential delegate system. He thinks it is crooked and rigged. (Inaudible) their takes next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: We have good news for Donald Trump. Today, he has picked up 12 more delegates after Missouri, finally certified results of its primary from March 15. Mr. Trump still isn't happy however about the delegate system overall following Ted Cruz' voterless (ph) victory this weekend in Colorado. Here he is just moments ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You know the system, folks, it's rigged. It's a rigged system. When you look at Colorado, people can say oh, well, that's the way the game is played. Look, they should have had an election. They didn't have an election. A Republican system is absolutely rigged. It is a phony deal. I have millions of votes more but I also have delegates more. These are dirty tricksters. This is a dirty trick. And I'll tell you why. The RNC, the Republican National Committee, they should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap to happen.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Wow! Is the GOP system rigged? Is Trump right? These guys don't think so.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: They have rigged it on the Democrat side. They're using the super delegates. It is not rigged on the Republican side. This is just the establishment taking advantage.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I don't think it was designed to stop Donald Trump. Because it was designed before he came into the primaries.REINCE PRIEBUS, RNC: It is the same process they used, Greta, four years ago. It is no different. Some states use a primary system to bind delegates. Some states use a caucus system on bind delegates. There is nothing mysterious about this.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: All right. We're going to take a vote right here. We're going to have a count.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Who in this panel thinks that the system is rigged?BOLLING: What system?(CROSSTALK)BILA: It is not a rigged. It is a bad system. But it is not rigged against him.WILLIAMS: Melissa.FRANCIS: How about bizarre, abnormal, strange.WILLIAMS: It is rigged?FRANCIS: Rigged for whom?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Rigged for the system, for the establishment?FRANCIS: Yes.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: It is rigged for the establishment, yes.WILLIAMS: All right.FRANCIS: I don't think it is rigged against Donald Trump. It was created before he got there.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: My personal hero gets to vote. My hero, you get to vote.GUTFELD: Cruz just used the caucus rules the way Trump use bankruptcy rules.WILLIAMS: That's the trick.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Trump used bankruptcy rules. He used the banking rules to help him screw other people, and now he's mad that he's getting screwed?By the way, I have a good metaphor for this. Imagine if you're a college student and you have a mid-term. Right? And they move the mid-term, but they told everybody six months ago. And everybody shows up. All the other students show up. The professor shows up. It's in a nice building. You didn't show up, because you were too cheap to buy a damn alarm clock.Trump was too cheap to put in an infrastructure in Colorado. He even fired some guy like a couple of weeks ago. He didn't put the attention to this. He didn't buy the alarm clock.I mean, the fact is, he talks about being surrounded with great people. The great people, that's their fault.And by the way, he should love the delegates. He has a larger percentage of delegates than of votes. If the system is rigged, it's for him.BOLLING: You answered a different question than Juan asked. Juan asked, is the delegate system rigged? You answered Colorado -- and I will agree with you 100 percent -- Trump dropped the ball in Colorado. That was an opportunity to get some delegates. He thought they were all going to come to him. It didn't. He should have -- he should have...GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: ... planted some people there; weren't there. He should have had Paul Manafort there.GUTFELD: But that's why -- the guy got fired.BOLLING: But the bigger picture: the system is rigged. And it's not just rigged against Trump. It's rigged against Cruz also.FRANCIS: Right. Yes.GUTFELD: But Cruz has adapted. Cruz adapted.BOLLING: No, but here's what no one's getting. No one is getting that, when they go to this convention, at the convention, the rules committee at the convention is made up of Trump delegates, Cruz delegates, Kasich delegates and a whole group of people who are neither, people who are disinterested. The RNC chooses those people. If those people have enough support, they can change that rule 40, 40-B, which is going to allow anyone on a subsequent ballot to become a nominee.WILLIAMS: Those are the rules. By the way...BOLLING: It's rigged so that the RNC...WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: ... can pick who the nominee is going to be.WILLIAMS: They never do; they never do. Let me just say, you know, at this table, then, the vote was, like, 3-2. But it was -- you say it's rigged. But not rigged against Trump.FRANCIS: No, I think it's rigged for the establishment.WILLIAMS: All right.FRANCIS: And so it's against -- I mean, Cruz is not the establishment. He has adapted to the rules, like you said, like the bankruptcy rule.GUTFELD: Six of the 10 GOP brokered conventions have ended up in a winning presidency for the GOP. So maybe it might be rigged to win a general election. Not to -- not to, I don't know, indulge somebody that emotionally you like but will lose.WILLIAMS: All right. Everybody agrees at the table that the establishment looks out for itself. And the name most often floated as the candidate of the establishment, if we get to an open convention, is Paul Ryan. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: So let me be clear. I don't want, nor will I accept the nomination for our party.So let me speak directly to the delegates on this. If no candidate has a majority in the first ballot, I believe that you should only choose from a person who has actually participated in the primary. Count me out.I simply believe that, if you want to be the nominee for our party, to be the president, you should actually run for it. I chose not to do this. Therefore, I should not be considered, period, end of story. I just think it would be wrong to go any other way.So let me say again. I am not going to be our party's nominee.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Now Jedidiah...BILA: Yes.WILLIAMS: ... I think I'm -- I think I'm having a flashback, you know, because I've been sipping from Greg's cup. And instead, in the flashback it said, Paul Ryan said, ""I don't want to be speaker of the House. I'll never take that job.""BILA: That's true. I think it's a little bit different to run for president than to accept a position as speaker.This guy doesn't want the job. People get obsessed with Paul Ryan, and they get obsessed with Mitt Romney. And they ask them repeatedly. Like he'll have to answer this another 750 times. He doesn't want the job. Move on.I don't even think he'd be great for the job. When he was on the ticket with Romney, he went from being, you know, this bull that was out there, and all of a sudden, he got all shy. He wasn't tough on Barack Obama. I don't know that he's a great candidate, and I don't know the conservatives would like him.WILLIAMS: You like Paul Ryan?BOLLING: I think that was -- he said something very important. And it wasn't that he didn't want to be president. Who knows if he does or not. What he did say is it should be someone that has run for president, which opened the door for 17 candidates, because remember, we started with 17. In my opinion, I think -- I think what that is, he said any one of the 17.WILLIAMS: I thought he meant any of the three.BOLLING: No. And that's why -- they don't, they don't end their candidacy; they suspend them. So technically, Marco Rubio is suspended.WILLIAMS: I get it.BOLLING: Which they could come back.WILLIAMS: What do you think? What do you think?FRANCIS: I mean, that was -- why did he put out that video that was totally presidential with the overhead shot coming down, you saw him addressing everyone and the flag behind him. It's ridiculous. I mean, he's out there. I know I heard what he said. I think he protests too much.WILLIAMS: What do you think, Gregory.FRANCIS: ... are asking him. I mean, come on.WILLIAMS: Is it posturing, Greg?GUTFELD: I don't think he ever really was talking about running. So I don't know. It was never that.FRANCIS: I mean, ""Even if everybody begs me.""GUTFELD: But a lot of people are bringing this up.BILA: He likes to be wanted. He's like that guy who keeps saying he wants you to date him, but ""You want me."" He wants you to want him, but he doesn't want to date you.GUTFELD: You know who won on three ballots? Abe Lincoln. He came in with 22 percent of the delegates.WILLIAMS: He'd do pretty well, too.GUTFELD: Not for a while.WILLIAMS: He still has to win the nomination.Trump is already throwing out names of possible running mates. And some of those names, wow, you're going to be surprised. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BILA: Remember the days when Donald Trump would mock Little Marco? Now, in a surprising development, Marco Rubio appears to be on Trump's short list for V.P. Yes, pun intended.In a new interview with FOX News contributor and USA Today columnist Kirsten Powers, the Republican front-runner said, quote, ""There are people I have in mind in terms of vice president. I just haven't told anybody names. I do like Marco. I do like John Kasich. I like Scott Walker, actually, in a lot of ways. I hit him very hard, but I've always liked him.""Would any of those former opponents accept a V.P. offer from Trump?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not going to be anybody's vice president. I'm not -- I'm just not going to -- I'm not interested in being vice president.GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You're asking me if I would be his vice president?ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Would you?KASICH: Zero.COOPER: Absolutely not?KASICH: I'm not going to be anybody's vice president. I would be the worst vice president the country ever saw. You know why? I'm not like a vice president. I'm a president.(END VIDEO CLIP)BILA: Uh-oh. And Governor Walker told a Milwaukee paper he laughed when he heard his name mentioned as a possible Trump pick. He, of course, endorsed Cruz.OK, Gutfeld, this has gotten ugly. How is he going to go from calling him Little Marco and the hands and that whole thing to all of a sudden being like, ""Hey, want to be my V.P.?""GUTFELD: I think -- I think who -- why does he need a V.P.? I've said this before. He should just be the P. and the V.P. and the staff. He should -- maybe get Omarosa and Dennis Rodman.Actually, you know what would be perfect? He needs somebody who can talk to that he can listen to. And the only person I can think of is George H. Ross. Remember?BOLLING: Yes, his -- ""Celebrity Apprentice."" The judge, yes.GUTFELD: Eight-eight years old, but he was the only guy. Donald is like, what do you think? And he'd go, ""Hmm."" And then he'd go, ""You're fired.""BILA: I think he has to pick somebody, Juan, from outside the field. I don't think any of these guys are going -- it's gotten too ugly. I don't think they've going to want to be tied to his brand. I think they've all dragged each other through the mud, and they'll compromise their own brand if all of a sudden they go from hating him and saying all these terrible things to being, ""Oh, sure, I'll be your teammate.""So who can he pick?WILLIAMS: I don't know, because you know, I sort of -- I heard the list, and I thought the one name missing is Ted Cruz. Right? He just didn't even...GUTFELD: Because he would say yes.FRANCIS: Chris Christie. Chris Christie is, like, his best friend.WILLIAMS: Yes.FRANCIS: I totally disagree with you; I think all of these guys would say yes. I think this is politics. You go out there, and you say awful things about each other, and then it's over and you all get together, because you want to be one heartbeat away from the presidency, maybe. I mean, you want to run the next time.GUTFELD: Hillary was Obama's secretary of state after that.FRANCIS: Right, after all of that. It's ridiculous.But I loved Walker's response when he said that it was breathtaking to hear his name. It literally took his breath away when he heard his name mentioned.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: He is so -- he's unpredictable. I think the best choice he could possibly pick...GUTFELD: Oprah.BOLLING: Joe Biden.BILA: Are you serious?BOLLING: He's not going to run for president. He'd bring in some Democrats.GUTFELD: Your plan, that undercuts Hillary. Right?BOLLING: It undercuts everybody. I love it. And Joe Biden is beloved. Honestly, beloved on both sides.BILA: Wait, you think conservatives are going to take to Biden well?BOLLING: No, I think whoever is going to vote -- whoever going to vote for Donald Trump isn't going to be swayed by who he picks as a vice president.BILA: That would be great, though, the Biden-Sanders drama. This is turning into a TV show I really would want to watch.FRANCIS: Yes.BILA: Now Kasich, though, I think actually would be a good choice. I mean, I know he's saying he's going to say no, but he appeals to moderates. He has a very wide appeal. And his favorability numbers of everybody are still the highest.GUTFELD: The only one so far in the general polling that could beat Hillary.BILA: Yes.GUTFELD: So he's a good choice.BILA: Yes. Do you think that Trump thinks about this seriously at this stage of the game, though? Do you think he's actually strategizing in terms of votes he can't get on his own and then who can pull in -- do you think he's actually doing that at this stage?FRANCIS: I think even when he was hurdling Molotov cocktails at Marco Rubio's head, he was still thinking, ""Well, I might pick this guy later to be my V.P., because he represents a demographic that I'm not getting.Absolutely. I think in politics, that's how it works. I think everyone's used to it. They know when those guys stood there and stammered and said, ""No, I would never be his V.P.,"" they were lying.I mean, it just -- that's how it goes.BILA: OK. Well, next on ""The Five,"" do not get between this mom and Mickey Mouse.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (UNINTELLIGIBLE SHOUTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)BILA: What made this frustrated passenger completely unravel at the airport? That's coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FRANCIS: Traveling, as you know, can be very stressful, but traveling with children can sometimes bring you very close to the edge. Fold in a flight delay by half a day, and this mom just completely lost it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm getting everyone's name here, because you're all (EXPLETIVE DELETED). You lied to me! I'm sitting here since 8 a.m. with a 9-year-old who's waiting for her vacation and a 13-year-old. If there's no flight, just say there's no flight. Say there's no flight. In the way of getting what we want. We're waiting all our life for this. I'm waiting for this Disney cruise for a year already.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: A year.FRANCIS: And of course, everyone is taking videotape with their phones. Tape, whatever. I just showed my age there. They're recording it on their phone and sending it out.It was pretty exciting at the American Airlines gate at New York's LaGuardia Airport. That furious mother melted down in front of her kids and everyone else, with a camera, after her flight to Miami kept getting delayed, impacting her Disney cruise vacation.The flight did eventually take off, albeit 12 hours later. As for the family, they made it in time for their cruise. A very happy ending. Now we are all laughing around this table. Jedidiah, I saw some deep belly laughs from you.BILA: Yes.FRANCIS: You've been there, though.BILA: Yes.FRANCIS: You've been there.BILA: I want to be her in my next life.FRANCIS: Really?BILA: I'm way too polite. So I only have meltdowns like that with my friends and family. And then when I'm in public, you know, I want to be able to scream sometimes.I was in Colorado. There was a horrible snowstorm. I got stuck in what I can only describe as the Bates Motel overnight. I never said a word. I went to Catholic school my whole life. I was taught, ""You know what? You don't like something, zip it. You know, just handle it.""And you know what? I want to be someone that screams like that and it makes YouTube because of it. Good for her.FRANCIS: Good for her, although I wonder about the wisdom of this. Because the person behind the counter has all the power to either put her on another flight or not. I mean, this is like insulting the waiter before the food has come out. You know for sure something's going to happen in the back.GUTFELD: Yes, but you know, two things. You want to be like that? Have kids. Moms are -- Moms are supposed to be a little crazy. If there were digital phones when I was a child in the '70s, my poor mother. My poor mother would yell at everything. She'd yell at me; she'd yell at anybody. She was a screamer. She had four kids. They were driving her crazy. She had a sick husband. Everything went nuts. She went nuts. And that's what you're supposed to do.In your point of view, from your question, in customer service, they are goal-oriented. When you're talking to them, you're like talking to your smartphone or a rock. They just sit there, and they listen to you, because their goal is that you get there safely and that you don't die. And you can yell at them all want. It's artificial intelligence. You can't talk to them. That's true. That's the job.FRANCIS: First of all, I totally disagree with you. Because with kids around, I edit myself more. I was much more insane before I had kids.GUTFELD: You're a terrible mom.FRANCIS: But now I try not to go off on people in front of my kids. You're supposed to set a decent example.GUTFELD: If you're the Mama lion, you have to scream.FRANCIS: I want to say that the cruise didn't take off until 5 a.m. the next day, and this was the night before. She did leave -- I mean, she cut it close, but it's not like it was about to leave.BOLLING: You're saying it's her fault?FRANCIS: No, no, no. I'm trying to provide all the facts. I know, I know.BOLLING: At some point the airline has to say -- I'm going to need another piece of equipment in here, get these people out, or spread them out on other airlines. They can pay for another airline to take those passengers.I feel for her. And I know my beautiful wife, who's patient more than everyone, probably around the four- or five-hour mark, would start doing that, as well, with or without the kids.FRANCIS: No, you make another plan. I make another plan. I go to a different desk, call in. I mean, like start doing something. I'm not going to stand there and let them control this out-of-control situation. Juan, help me out.WILLIAMS: By the way, it was 2 a.m. Remember it was 2 a.m.FRANCIS: No. It was 9. It was like midnight.WILLIAMS: No, I think it was 2 a.m. is what I read. And the thing about it is I agree with you. Make another plan, Stan.FRANCIS: Yes.WILLIAMS: You know? Because I don't understand it. You can't let them control your life. It's so frustrating.FRANCIS: I would go out, get in a car, drive to another airport.BILA: Like Superman. I don't need airplanes.FRANCIS: Also a fantastic solution. We solved it.Now ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Time for ""One More Thing."" I'll go first. I'm going to be on ""O'Reilly"" tonight with Bernie, talking about all sorts of fun stuff.BOLLING: Sanders?GUTFELD: I think, yes, I think we might be talking about Sanders. That's true. And other junk.BOLLING: Bernie Sanders.GUTFELD: Bernie Sanders. Oh! Bernie McGuirk.FRANCIS: You missed it.GUTFELD: I had a wild weekend. All right.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD (singing): Greg's Prom Tips(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Right over my head.All right. Still about a month or so away. This is not about the prom. It is about the ask.Girls, if a guy does some kind of overdramatic prom ask with, like, music and all this sort of stuff, say no, because he's making it about him. You don't want anything too overly flamboyant or dramatic when you're doing a prom ask. Instead, if some shy geeky kid comes up to you and asks you quietly, say yes. Because you never know. He could be the next Bill Hemmer.BILA: Aw, I love that.GUTFELD: You're up, Melissa.FRANCIS: OK. My turn. Megyn Kelly is sitting down tonight for an exclusive with Heidi Cruz. It is the first time we have heard from Heidi Cruz since, well, she got caught up in the whole campaign thing with Twitter. Here's a taste.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Recently, Donald Trump sent out an unkind retweet about you comparing your appearance unfavorably to that of his wife, Melania Trump, who is a retired model. How did that retweet first come to your attention?HEIDI CRUZ, WIFE OF TED CRUZ: Well, one great thing about me, Megyn, is I don't tweet. So I had an ability to completely ignore it. And you know, I think we have a pattern of behavior here that, when Donald Trump is falling behind -- I really have to honestly say, it didn't impact me in the least.(END VIDEO CLIP)FRANCIS: See? That's what I told my kids. If you just ignore them, it doesn't bother you.The rest of this fantastic interview tonight at 9 p.m. Eastern right here on the FOX News Channel. ""The Kelly Files.""GUTFELD: Eric.BOLLING: All right. Very quickly. So when the NBA first started, there wasn't a three-point line, and there wasn't a shot clock. Right? So rules apparently changed over the years. All right. Think about that for a second.Go to my Facebook page -- I'm sorry, Twitter page, because I put up a poll. ""Votes are more of a recommendation than an actual vote."" That's because the delegates actually are the ones who are picking the nominee, not the votes. It's a kind of recommendation.So I want to hear what you have to say. Do you agree with that? If you agree with the process, say, ""Yes, rules are rules."" Check yes. Or no, it's time for the rules to be changed to reflect the vote more accurately.GUTFELD: All right. Jedediah.BILA: So last week in the green room, Greg here woke me up from a nap, and Juan happened to be rolling footage. So let's take a look at what happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(TIGER WAKES SLEEPING TIGER, GETS SWATTED AND BOY WHO IS WATCHING RUNS OFF)(END VIDEO CLIP)BILA: I mean, this is what he gets. I mean, you notice which one is the vicious one there and which one can beat the other one up, mind you. So memo to everyone: don't wake me up from a nap.GUTFELD: Interesting. That kid ran away from home. They haven't found him yet. Who knows where he went?Juan.WILLIAMS: OK. So NBA legend Kobe Bryant will play his final game Wednesday night in L.A. against the Utah Jazz.Now, I mentioned this to Eric and Melissa, because watch the economics here. His game right now is listed at $2,100 on Monday afternoon. More than 500 percent higher than the average cost of a Lakers game home ticket. There's one ticket listed for $25,000. This is nostalgia. It doesn't say he doesn't have a great game; just nostalgia. Can you believe this Michael Jordan game? Never.GUTFELD: I can't believe it, Juan.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST: Personal Story segment tonight, the Black Lives Matter movement. As you may know, they are disrupting political events by confronting candidates of both parties over perceived white supremacy. Now, it's hard to tell what the end game is here. But from what I have seen the Black Lives Matter crew is really about money, reparations for past and injustice.Earlier this week, our pal, Dr. Cornell West, very sympathetic to Black Lives Matter, talked with me about race.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: All right, Professor, I want you to react to something Thomas Sowell wrote. You know him, right?CORNEL WEST, PH.D., UNION THEOLOGICAL SEMINAR PROFESSOR: Very sophisticated economist.O'REILLY: He says, quote, ""A salute to Bill O'Reilly for being one of the few people in the media to talk plain common sense about the disintegrations of the black family and the resulting social problems that follow.""So, I want you guys in the Black Lives Matter movement to join me all right. Instead of directing your ire toward the large societal problem of African-Americans, let's get into the family fabric first, try to solve that and then go back to the other thing.Are you on board?WEST: Well, we do have to begin with the system. Certainly, the internal challenge, black self-love, black self-respect, of sustaining a family, sustaining community, jobs with a living wage with decent housing, with quality education.But you can't overlook the vicious legacy of white supremacy, Brother Bill, you know it's coming.O'REILLY: See, I don't buy that. You know I don't buy it. The white supremacy movement --WEST: The legacy of it I'm talking about, the legacy of white supremacy.O'REILLY: Irish have legacy.WEST: Arbitrary --O'REILLY: You can do that with every race.WEST: Oh, no, no.O'REILLY: Every color --WEST: Ethnicity. We had a civil war over white supremacy. Didn't have civil war over Irish brothers and sisters.O'REILLY: The Irish were brutalized by the British and to this day that resonates. But we have to look forward. Are you a socialist? Are you like Bernie Sanders you are a socialist? You want the government to basically seize assets and to redistribute? Is that what you want?WEST: I am a revolutionary Christian who looks at the world through the vantage point of the weak and the vulnerable. So, it's not a matter of - isms. I want to make sure each person made in the image of God is able to live a life of decency and dignity.O'REILLY: But that takes resources to do.WEST: You can't do it when 40 percent of your children living in poverty.O'REILLY: OK.WEST: Black and brown. Twenty-two percent of all children, no matter what color living in poverty. Yes, we've got to eliminate poverty.O'REILLY: All right. So, by elimination of poverty you want to take from those who have and then give to those who have not, correct?WEST: Well --.O'REILLY: Is that correct or not, professor?WEST: You know, we have got to put it in context, there's already been a redistribution of wealth from poor and working people --O'REILLY: This is just justice you want?WEST: No. We want --(CROSSTALK)O'REILLY: Do you want to take from me and I'm totally innocent about the historical stuff. I'm totally innocent. You want to take my stuff and give it to other people because of what may have happened in the historical past.WEST: The government has already taken from you in terms of taxes.O'REILLY: They have. They take a lot.WEST: Goes to the military rather than to quality education, quality jobs and so forth.O'REILLY: We live in a dangerous world. You have to protect all people.WEST: But we don't need 54 percent of every dollar.O'REILLY: That's what you see but I know danger.WEST: You talk about the waste.O'REILLY: I hate the waste.WEST: We agree this that regard.O'REILLY: Do you like Cuba? Do you like that system over there?WEST: No Cuba is too authoritarian. I heard you say the other day when you talked about Bernie Sanders he wants to take your house away and leave you with the flag. That sounds like in 2008 in terms of the financial catastrophe and capitalist greed on Wall Street.O'REILLY: I hate capitalist greed. Bernie is a socialist. You don't admit to being one, but I know you are.WEST: I am a Democratic socialist.O'REILLY: You are.WEST: But my identity is revolutionary Christian who looks at the eyes through the poor and working class.(CROSSTALK)O'REILLY: I want to help the poor and working class.WEST: But Bernie isn't (INAUDIBLE) combat and that's it. You want to help the class after it trickles down with the 1 percent.O'REILLY: No, no. I want a dual process of fair economic system. I'm for the raising of the minimum wage.WEST: I agree.O'REILLY: But personal responsibility has to be taught.WEST: I agree personal responsibility is very important. I agree with that.O'REILLY: That's right. You can't continue to have 75 percent of black babies being born out of wedlock. You can't.WEST: Thirty-five white babies out of wedlock.O'REILLY: That doesn't matter. You are deflecting the big problem.WEST: I'm talking about it's a systemic problem. But if all you want to talk about --O'REILLY: Not all --(CROSSTALK)WEST: But you started the dialogue with brother Sowell personal responsibility, family. You say, wait a minute, you have got is percent of the population have 42 percent of the wealth. They used to have 20 percent. That's redistribution of wealth upwards, upward, upward.O'REILLY: As African-Americans become more educated and become more sophisticated in the marketplace, that gap will shrink. You forcing it to shrink will never work. It never has worked.Last word.WEST: What evidence do you have in terms of the free market functioning inequality is reduced? You don't have evidence of that.O'REILLY: Because poor in America live better than most other middle class in the world.WEST: The history of Irish brothers and sisters in America is, what? Tied to the public fear, policemen, firemen, moving into mayorship, moving into politics.O'REILLY: Right. But I want that for African-Americans, too. The same thing.WEST: You want free market.O'REILLY: Sure, it was. It was education. It was family structure. It was a sense of responsibility, and that's how the Irish American moved up.Last word?WEST: We've got still got Irish brothers and sisters locked in poverty.O'REILLY: In the bible, the poor will always be with us.WEST: What Jesus said is what you do for the least of these you do for me.O'REILLY: That's right.
