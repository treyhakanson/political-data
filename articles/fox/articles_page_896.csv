This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What Donald Trump said yesterday disqualifies him from serving as president.  REP. PAUL RYAN, R, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  Normally I do not comment on what's going on in the presidential election.  I will take an exception today.  This is not conservatism.  What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for.  JEB BUSH, R, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  What we shouldn't do is to just, you know, say all Muslims aren't coming into our country.  It's not the about the blowhards out there just saying stuff.  REP. DAVID JOLLY, R, FLORIDA:  It is time that my side of the aisle has one less candidate in the race for the White House.  It is time for Donald Trump to withdraw from the race.  (END VIDEO CLIP)SHANNON BREAM:  All right, let's bring in our panel.  We have a little bit of breaking news, too.  Charles Hurt, political columnist for the ""Washington Times,"" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of ""The Hill,"" and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.  All right, so we have a late poll coming in from New Hampshire.  This is CNN's New Hampshire poll showing Trump at 32 percent, a commanding lead there.  Next in line Rubio at 14 percent, almost 20 points back.  And you can see the list as you go down there.  Christie has been making gains there as well.Now the AP is just reporting that Trump is scheduled to make a visit to Jordan at the end of this month.  Of course you know they've been taking in millions of refugees from that region, and a lot of folks are abandoned there as they can't survive in their home countries at this point.  Charles, let's start with you.  What do you make of this, because obviously this poll has been taken over a number of days, but it comes in the wake of comments by Trump?  It's been repeated across the board by Democrats and Republicans alike all standing in line to repudiate it.  But it seems like the American public is OK with a lot of what the public has been saying.  CHARLES HURT, ""WASHINGTON TIMES"":  Shannon, I'm amazed that so many people are surprised by the remarks from Donald Trump.  We've had seven years of a president who has not taken Islamic -- radical Islamic terrorism seriously.  We've had seven years of a president who has not taken border security seriously.  And we've had seven years of people getting browbeaten for being bigots and for being racists because they're concerned about things like radical Islamic terrorism.  And when you have an environment like this, you cannot be surprised that somebody, especially somebody who is as tuned in as sort of what the American public thinks and feels at a guttural level, you can't be surprised when he comes out and says something like this that would, which is obviously highly politically incorrect.  But for a lot of people sitting out there across America, they hear this plan that we're going to ban all Muslims until we find out what the hell is going on here.  A lot of people heard that and said it's about time we did something like this.  BREAM:  A.B., his supporters point out that the second part of the statement is important, ""until we find out what the hell is going on here,"" and that's a quote.  Sorry mom.  But the fact is they're saying, listen, it's a temporary thing.  A lot of people think that's reasonable.  A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, ""THE HILL"":  What's not reasonable is the way that Donald Trump belched this out yesterday without having any planning or measure factoring into this.  There was no forethought.  It was obvious.  He said, well, his spokesman said it would apply to American Muslims who were citizens who were trying to get back in potentially.  Then he said that's not true.  He said it will be temporary.  When asked when it could end or when the decks would clear or there would be an end to a pause to this moratorium, he said we'd have to just feel it or taste it or something.  He had no actual plan for this.  He made a statement.  He knew it would create a firestorm.  He loves that.  It's what he does.  He knew his supporters would agree with all of it.  But it's not a job, it's never been a job for someone who is impulsive and doesn't plan their policy matters on something that's potentially unconstitutional with a religious test, we've never had that before.  Let alone it's a complete shift in the fundamentals of this country, without planning out exactly how it would work.  You just don't do that.  It's not a job for someone who is impulsive.  So it's fine that his supporters think it's great.  It's not fine for a man who is trying to win a general election campaign in 2016.  BREAM:  I want to point to another ""USA Today"" poll that was also out, and this was looking at the Republican presidential nomination.  Trump at the top there.  This is of 357 likely Republican voters.  He comes in at 27.5 percent, followed by Cruz back 11 points at 16.5 percent.  But the interesting number from that as well if he ran as an independent candidate, they were asked, would you still vote for them?  These are the folks who say they're supporting Trump, 68 percent, Charles, say they would go with him if he ran as an independent.  How much of a nightmare is that for the GOP?  CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  It's a terrible nightmare.  But, look, the problem is not that he might cost them the presidency.  The problem is what he's doing to the level of American discourse.  This is at the highest level of presidential politics.  And the issue is not just that it's impulsive or unreasonable.  This is truly, deeply bigoted.  It is indefensible.  And even if you put all of that aside, which you wouldn't, but if you wanted to, and just talked about the practicality of this, he was asked, how do you police this?  He said, well, when you come through customs, the guy will ask you, are you a Muslim.  And here is Donald Trump, tough guy, right?  He's going to really -- he's competent, all the others are incompetent.  His answer is you're going to ask them, is he a Muslim.          So here's a guy that Trump is saying is high bound to come out and kill people innocently, but he's going to be held to a George Washington cherry tree standard of not telling a lie to an infidel immigration officer.  So I think that Chris Stirewalt had an answer to this dilemma.   He suggested that everybody come from LaGuardia, JFK, or Dulles be forced to eat a ham sandwich.  Now that, I would admit, that some people will be caught in the net who shouldn't, orthodox Jews and vegetarians.  But as Trump says, this is war, and there will be collateral damage, so we have to get serious about this.  BREAM:  Well, I find Chris Stirewalt often has very good suggestions about how to get things done.  That one sounds a little controversial.  HURT:  Usually involving food.  BREAM:  Yes, bacon.  HURT:  Pork products.  BREAM:  Interesting, after this number came out with the 68 percent who say they would follow, there was a tweet by Jeb Bush.  And he said ""Maybe Donald negotiated a deal with his buddy @HillaryClinton.  Continuing this path will put her in the White House.""  Also today Carly Fiorina said Trump is sort of like a gift to Hillary Clinton.  Charlie what do you say?  HURT:  You know, I think it's kind of interesting that we're almost six months into the Trump, whatever this is, and we're still talking about the same thing, which is he comes out, guns a-blazing.  He comes up with an idea to fix a problem and it's very vague and very bombastic and it gets a lot of people's attention, especially inside the beltway, and people's heads explode.  And they try to drill down to see what the policy specifics are.  And the truth of the matter is that he's not thinking policy specifics when he says stuff like this.  But when he does, take immigration, for example, and he's talking about building a great big wall with a big door and all this kind of stuff, and then when he came out with his immigration policy, it made a whole lot more sense.  And as you said, at the beginning, it does depend on what it means, what he means by figure out what the hell is going on.  And if it's simply that we need to determine that all of these people coming from Muslim countries are not affiliated with Islamic terrorism, then they can come in, that doesn't seem so unreasonable.  KRAUTHAMMER:  Let me just say one thing.  The deportation of 11 million people, which would be the largest police action in the United States since the rounding up of Japanese-Americans in the Second World War, is not a reasonable proposal.  It's a disgrace.  And this is in the same tradition.  It's not that he comes out with it and it's stunning and unplanned and the details aren't worked out.  It is fundamentally un- American.  And I think that's why people are upset.  This is injecting a poison into the body politic at the highest level, and that's where the damage is.  BREAM:  Well, we'll watch, because these polls that we've gotten in the last couple of days of course were taken prior to his comments.  So we'll see.  I mean a lot of what he's say something resonating with a lot of folks.  Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Gretchen Carlson with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, and she sleds on a bottle cap -- Dana Perino, ""The Five.""Last night on something called CNN, they held a special episode of ""Survivor for Socialists"" where Hillary was asked about her e-mail. I bet she's not saying it was an error in judgment because nothing she did was wrong. It was not in any way prohibited.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not willing to say it was an error in judgment, because what -- nothing that did I was wrong. It was not, it was not in any way prohibited.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Hmm. Yeah, cut and pasting classified info into unclassified arenas is totally legit, according to no one with a license to practice law.And I wonder if she said Benghazi is only still an issue because the Republicans want to keep it an issue. They know it. I know it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: This is only still an issue because the Republicans want to keep it an issue. They know it. I know it.(APPLAUSE)It's already been eight investigations, most of them by Republicans in the Congress. The House Intelligence Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and what did they conclude? That there were problems that night, but they were ones that we should look at, not from the perspective of placing blame or pointing fingers, but...(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: You can't point fingers. But look, she's not wrong. The Republicans are making it an issue because it is supposed to be an issue. She falsely pushed the video and lied to the grieving families. And now she wants everyone to move on. That's the cry of a criminal or spouse caught in the act. But complaining that the Republicans want to keep the story of Benghazi alive, that's pathetic. Would she complain if it wasn't Benghazi, but the story was about Sandy Hook or Charleston? She's complaining about people doing the right thing. Who cares if it's political? Shut up. And what exactly should we focus instead? Her good points, i.e., her treatment of Bill's women, her casual disdain for national security, her wonderful laugh?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: But any criticism can be recast as an attack on her. She's the victim, a woman, no less, which affords her immunity. So say feminists denying their own hypocrisy. Sure, the Benghazi dead spent 13 hours in hell, but she was questioned almost as long.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: Did you tell them it was about the film? And what's your response?CLINTON: No. You know, look, I understand the continuing grief at the loss that parents experienced with the loss of these four brave Americans. And I did testify, as you know, for 11 hours. And I answered all of these questions. Now, I can't -- I can't help if the people think there has to be something else there.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So sorry, Benghazi dead. Your story is over. And why? Because Hillary has moved on to bigger and better things. And you're not included.So last night was quite a barn burner, KG. The Town Hall, it was explosive.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah, but it just goes to show her attitude. She feels very entitled to the presidency, to be commander- in-chief. She doesn't care that she's epically failed for forward, that she'd lost American lives, that she's got blood on her hands. Not to mention the fact that she has, in fact, endangered our national security, put people's lives on the line because of her recklessness with respect to her e-mail server. She really doesn't seem to care. And in fact, she has martyred herself by saying that she, OK, she testified for 11 hours. Did she pull an almightier and stay up all night, while Americans were being slaughtered in Benghazi and she stood by and did nothing?GUTFELD: Hmm. Fair question.There's a Fox News poll, Juan, that's basically saying the top, the democratic quality among democratic voters is being honest and trustworthy. So when you see Hillary, she does not appear to have that trait in spades. She is about as trustworthy as a used car salesman.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I think that's not true, but I think that is the case that you're right. The poll is pretty clear that that's what the voter's value. And when it comes to honesty and trustworthy, she is close to bottom of the barrel. But I must say the bottom of the barrel would be the people who were leading the republican, side of the thing. If you ask people about Trump, about Cruz, I think they come in like at 27 percent and 17 percent. Hillary comes in at 30 plus, so it mean -- clearly, people are looking at other issues to reflect their anger, reflect their concerns, reflect their needs, and Hillary, at the moment, I thought had a very good moment last night in that town hall that you have so ridiculed her for. When she was asked by a young person, hey, so why did they throw all these garbage at you?GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Exactly the kind of thing that you are talking about in a monologue.GUTFELD: Would you like to see that?WILLIAMS: Sure, sureGUTFELD: Would you like to see that sot Juan?WILLIAMS: Go for it.GUTFELD: Why don't I show the rest of America?WILLIAMS: You go for it, big time.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: You know, look, I've been around a long time. People have thrown all kinds of things at me. And you know, I can't keep up with it, I just keep going forward. They fall by the wayside. They come up with these outlandish things, they make these charges. I just keep going forward because there's nothing to it.(END VIDEO CLIP)ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: It blows me away that you think that was her finest moment...WILLIAMS: That was terrific.BOLLING: I literally wrote that down as her worst moment of the night.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: So I thought it was terrific. Because she said, you know what? I've been at the front line of change. And people who make change in this country, they get beat up.BOLLING: No, no. What I heard was a young person saying you're not very trustworthy, and it has been knocked against you for a long time. She said yeah, but people have been saying that for a long time. Well, that's proving...GUTFELD: True.BOLLING: That people have thought you are untrustworthy for a very long time. She walked right into that question. One thing I did -- look, the takeaway for me was, now I know why they originally wanted only a handful of debates for the DNC, for the democrats. She doesn't do well in this. She does better in debates that she does in the town hall where people are asking questions.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: There's a whole bunch of conspiracy theories flying around that CNN, they've gotten together and planted some of those. Apparently, they didn't. I guess they didn't, but the way I understand it worked was people ask questions and not toward a candidate. And CNN decided which candidate got the question. Well, giving her that question was a bad idea -- for at least in Hillary Clinton's camp -- eyes, it should be. She failed that.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: She fumbled that one miserably.WILLIAMS: You're wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Let me say you something, she -- we even said, you know what? I was for, working for single payer, the thing that Bernie Sanders talks about. And she said to that, we couldn't get it done, but we tried to get it done for young people. No. That worked for her.GUTFELD: I want to get Dana in here. I was looking at this. She always seems like a benevolent space alien on these town halls, like she's up there and she's telling them this great knowledge, but it seem so cold and orchestrated and fake.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, it was interesting when she said that she did -- but she did nothing wrong with her, on the e-mail scandal, which is really at odds with when she apologized...GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: For having the server. I mean, because she -- apparently, like that was what she thought three months ago, but now she feels like she can weather the storm. The reason I didn't like her answer is that, yeah. She just keeps on going because nothing sticks to her.GUILFOYLE: That's wrong.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: That she can actually just lie about Benghazi on the video. The video in particular, not necessarily the stand-down orders, I don't know about that. But pushing the video, that was -- that was abhorrent. In addition, Wendy Sherman; who was her top aide at the State Department in 2013.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: The report that Ed Henry had today, on Fox News, she brags about how they have these new technologies.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: These Blackberry that were different from when she worked for President Bill Clinton. And that they could actually share things that used to be on classified systems can now be shared freely on Blackberry's, and she's bragging about this. And this is a new video that would just -- came out today that --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Again, pokes hole in those arguments. Last thing I could -- if I could say something about her benevolence and the whole likeability factor. So last night at Eric's recommendation, I took a looked at that Showtime show, ""The Circus."" And it's a 29-minute episode. And one of the people that they follow is Bernie Sanders, his one of the first people. And, you I haven't really spent much time getting to know him all that well. And having watched that, he is very likable, and his wife -- obviously loves him very much. There's this trustworthiness. And the contrast with Hillary Clinton, it was quite stark for me.BOLLING: And last night, I think that was highlighted as well. Whether you disagree vehemently, like I do with Bernie Sanders's socialism and high taxation, and you know, transfer of wealth and redistribution. He still comes across as a much more relatable, likable candidate than Hillary Clinton by far. And now it all makes sense. Now it makes sense why there are so many GOP debates, and there were so few democrats. I think they just plan another one.WILLIAMS: You know what this is --BOLLING: I think they just plan another town hall.WILLIAMS: This is so curious to me that suddenly the four has become the Bernie Sanders for president headquarters -- who knew?GUTFELD: Well --WILLIAMS: Well, I guess it is because you're so worried about --BOLLING: For nominee, for nominee not for president.WILLIAMS: Oh, not for president. I'm sorry.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But it's because you're so worried about Hillary Clinton.GUILFOYLE: No, we're not.WILLIAMS: But I can't believe...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: We have disdain.WILLIAMS: That you're now a bunch of supporting a socialist. And I like Bernie Sanders, but I got to tell you something. I know Bernie Sanders. I've dealt with Bernie Sanders.GUILFOYLE: And?WILLIAMS: And Bernie Sanders is a grumpy old man.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: As Bernie Sanders is a grumpy guy.GUTFELD: Well, let's -- speaking of the grumpy guy. We have some tape of him from last night. Roll that tape.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BERNIE SANDERS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our message has resonated much faster, much further than I thought it would. And I think what the American people are perceiving -- is there is something very wrong in this country.I think we are touching a nerve with the American people who understand that establishment politics is just not good enough. We need bold changes, we need a political revolution.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: He always sounds like, Kimberly, that he's making a very specific order at a delicatessen, by the egg salad. And make sure that there's not - - not too much lettuce on it and that the bread be toasted --GUILFOYLE: And you know what? I bet he gets what he asks for.GUTFELD: Yes. Well, I hope he doesn't get what he asks for here, because not a revolution.GUILFOYLE: Well, no. I'm happy for him to get, you know, the nomination, but we'll stop right there.GUTFELD: Yeah.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: There will be no free potato salad for you at the deli. But you know, he is, he is somebody who is likable. People have been asking, oh, you guys are (inaudible) -- yeah, because we're honest. We're telling it like it is. The fact is he's more likable than Hillary Clinton.WILLIAMS: No.GUILFOYLE: Should he be president? No. Is he a socialist? Yes. Does he want a political revolution? Not on this country...BOLLING: Why did you say no, Juan?GUILFOYLE: Not on our watch.BOLLING: Why do you say no?WILLIAMS: I say --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It's the favorability, unfavorable -- ability on Bernie Sanders...GUTFELD: He had story. He had his story.BOLLING: Versus Hillary.WILLIAMS: No --GUTFELD: I can tell you...BOLLING: His story is like....WILLIAMS: You know what.BOLLING: Night and day between the two of them.WILLIAMS: I'm going to tell you something. Let me tell you something. He really doesn't like the fact that I even appear on ""The Five."" He really --(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: He doesn't like anybody who does --GUTFELD: He's like our viewers.PERINO: He knows that The Five exists?WILLIAMS: I think he does.PERINO: Well, that's --WILLIAMS: And let me just say, he -- this is a grumpy person. He's a very nice guy and I love some of the things he says. Because he says things --GUILFOYLE: Well, right now --WILLIAMS: That really would shake up to put --GUILFOYLE: To liking us better than you, Juan.PERINO: But you know what?BOLLING: His favor --WILLIAMS: I agree. Well, that's true.BOLLING: His favorability was like 95 plus percent, unfavorable at 3 percent.WILLIAMS: You were asking --BOLLING: Hillary is underwater by 22 points.WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.BOLLING: So --WILLIAMS: And who is under attack constantly? Not Bernie.BOLLING: Maybe you can't say that their -- but in that same world, likable, favorable, unfavorable. Hillary is more likeable than a guy who is 93 favorable.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm saying personally, that if you know this person personally --PERINO: But he's like -- but he's grumpy.WILLIAMS: But this is like what President Obama said the other day, that you know, Bernie is a shiny new object. Everybody is like, oh, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie. And Hillary, everybody knows Hillary. They've been attacking her. It was for years.GUTFELD: It's amazing that an elderly socialist for a democrat is a shiny new object.PERINO: Right. And also, it was really I thought very interesting to hear that from President Obama, who, eight years ago was kicking her rear end in Iowa --GUTFELD: Watch your mouth.PERINO: Saying the same thing about her.GUTFELD: Yeah. That's true.PERINO: Remember? That he was the big new shiny thing, and now he is making fun of Bernie Sanders?GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Do you know what the big new shiny thing is in Iowa now?BOLLING: What?GUILFOYLE: Us, ""The Five.""WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUTFELD: Yeah, that's true.GUILFOYLE: We're going to be there.GUTFELD: Uh- huh. That's a good transition, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: You're welcome.GUTFELD: Well done. All right, up next. New developments in the GOP, that stands for the grand old party Dana, yeah, including another endorsement for Donald Trump, a big name in the evangelical community. Find out who that is, when ""The Five"" return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Donald Trump picked up another big endorsement today, Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. throwing his support behind the frontrunner. With six days left to go, until Iowa voting, it could give him a big boost among evangelical voters. And Trump just surged to a new high. And yet another poll, 64 percent of republicans now say they expect him to be the nominee. His opponents are clearly feeling the pressure. Ted Cruz, just put out a new attack ad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I lived in New York City in Manhattan all my life, OK? So, you know, my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa.NARRATOR: They are different, like on abortion.TIM RUSSERT, NBC'S ""MEET THE PRESS"" SHOW HOST: Would President Trump ban partial-birth abortion?TRUMP: Well, I'm very pro-choice, and I really respect --NARRATOR: And what does Trump think about Iowa?TRUMP: How stupid are the people of Iowa.NARRATOR: Donald Trump. New York values not ours.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And of course, Donald is firing right back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Cruz lies. He is a liar. And that's why nobody likes him. That's why his Senate people won't endorse him. That's why he stands on the middle of the Senate floor and can't make a deal with anybody. He looks like a jerk. He's standing all by himself.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, so KG, big endorsement -- Jerry Falwell Jr., because the evangelical vote in Iowa, the caucus goers, somewhere around 50 percent of the evangelicals?WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah, no more playing checkers. It is all about chess at this point of who can get the best moves, and get the best endorsements to try and get the final push here for the caucus voters. And you'll notice while that ad was playing, that you know, Juan was cracking up, enjoying himself.WILLIAMS: Well, I mean you get --GUILFOYLE: He didn't seem to be bothered...WILLIAMS: Well, you know --GUILFOYLE: Too much by it.WILLIAMS: I didn't -- well, I thought the piece at the end, and I know that the front people have complained about it, Kimberly that, in fact, they took it out of context when he said Iowa was stupid because he was going on about Ben Carson in his booking saying that he stopped some guy from stabbing him or something --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Who's gonna believe that.BOLLING: In full context...WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: At the time Ben Carson was leading in Iowa...WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: And Trump was saying --WILLIAMS: Right.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But Trump was not saying in general...BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: People from Iowa are stupid.GUILFOYLE: Right. And I don't think he thinks that, but the problem is Cruz making these attacks about the New York values. That part, you know, I didn't like. I say, wait a second. I thought that you were -- it's kind of walking that back and not going to insult all the fine people that live in the state of New York. That to me is a turnoff.BOLLING: Yeah, that didn't work the first time for Cruz. It's going back at it.GUTFELD: I love it because you have Trump calling him a liar and a jerk. Then you have Cruz deriding New York values. This is not the firing line. It's more like what's my line? It's got the subtly of a play ground fight, which is inevitable with this kind of thing. But I'm more interested in what we're going to do in Iowa, and I found some events for all of us.GUILFOYLE: OK, cool.GUILFOYLE: Do you know that -- Dana, there was a yoga workshop at the Jasper Winery.PERINO: Are you serious?GUTFELD: That's on Friday.PERINO: Are you serious?GUTFELD: Yes, yes.PERINO: What time?GUTFELD: And I thought we can go see --GUILFOYLE: Oh my, gosh. Now we're going to go.GUTFELD: We can go see Hairball, that's a tribute heavy metal band playing at the Fairgrounds. I was thinking...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Juan, you and I could go to lefty's live music. There will be Polish death metal.WILLIAMS: What was that about?GUTFELD: What about Kieltyka he's the guitarist for Decapitated. And finally, the best for you, Kimberly, the Iowa Pork Congress starts tomorrow.GUILFOYLE: Come on.GUTFELD: And it's a great --(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: It's a trade show all about swine. And they're going to crown the Iowa Pork Queen.GUILFOYLE: Come on!PERINO: Oh my, God!WILLIAMS: Whoa!GUILFOYLE: Is it too late for a last-minute entry?GUTFELD: That's the --GUILFOYLE: I want to be the write-in...GUTFELD: That is the concept.PERINO: Write -in candidate.GUILFOYLE: Write- in candidate.WILLIAMS: I think so.BOLLING: I think they're all last-minute entries --(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Let's stay up all night making publishers (ph).GUTFELD: And you could be youth pork ambassador.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: I'll do that.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Oh my, God. I would be an amazing Queen of Pork.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Don't you think?BOLLING: Yeah --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: The (inaudible) bakeshop sound good.BOLLING: I saw mullets.GUTFELD: Yeah --BOLLING: It's a (inaudible) mullets.GUTFELD: And the Greenwood Lounge and the highlight. It sounds like fun.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Doesn't it sound like fun? I'm looking forward to it.PERINO: No. I want to take everyone bowling, that's my goal.GUILFOYLE: I know. You asked me to bring a casual outfit for bowling, pair of shoes and some pant...PERINO: Yeah, it's like some jeans.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: I got Bolling.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: OK.BOLLING: Do you fair to wait, now the --GUILFOYLE: No deal.PERINO: Yes. I want to run a couple of things. So when Donald Trump said, how stupid are the people of Iowa, like three, two months ago, whatever. I remember thinking, that will come back to haunt you, because it doesn't matter.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: What the context was -- and Donald Trump has proved it over and over again, with the tax against, or everybody else, so I thought it was a fair game. The other thing is Jim Garrity points out that in a lot of these polls, there's some interesting things going on. Whether -- there are either fewer evangelicals living in Iowa or the polling samples are off. The recent poll this morning said that caucus goers in 2012, 57 percent of them identified as evangelicals. This time around, same poll from four years ago, 36 percent evangelicals. Every evangelical vote counts, but I'm just saying that there might be fewer than it were in 2012.BOLLING: And they're looking for, I think a bigger turnout this year. I think 120,000 last year, maybe they're looking for 150, 160. Can we do this Bill O'Reilly as a theory on who's -- who was gonna decide the election this year? Let's listen to that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL O'REILLY, ""THE O'REILLY FACTOR"" SHOW HOST: In the end, independent voters would make the call this year. Not conservative as a liberals. Right now poll is saying independents are not bullish on Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. So Trump has a -- out of robust debate can come clarity and strength. Hopefully, that's what will happen next November -- hopefully.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: OK, Dana (inaudible)?PERINO: Well, if a Bill O'Reilly, then it basically shoots holes in Ted Cruz' strategy. Because he has been saying, along with many others in 2012, that if only the conservatives had come out and voted. That there's some mythical number of like 45 million conservative who's didn't vote. And therefore, he's gonna target them. He doesn't expect to get all of them. But if he could get more of them, then it could take him over the top. This is big a debate, though, in within republican circles of whether you need to try to get some independents or if you could just, should just focus on the conservatives.WILLIAMS: But listen --PERINO: I have been Bill O'Reilly's camp, but --WILLIAMS: Yeah, I am too on that point. But I think he is really talking about whites who didn't come out, white conservatives. Somehow this is gonna produce more. I just don't see it as realistic.PERINO: Nope.WILLIAMS: I think the big news, though, to come back to your point, Eric is that over the last week, what I've seen, and I even saw this last night. I'm talking to Krauthammer and George Will on the set.GUTFELD: Must be nice.WILLIAMS: Those guys --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Those guys --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: And I think the republican establishment like, you know, Terry Branstad, the governor of Iowa, Charles Grassley --BOLLING: Chuck Grassley.WILLIAMS: Charles Grassley, the senator from Iowa -- those guys now are all, it looks to me. They might as well come out today and endorse Trump. The same thing that --PERINO: I disagree. I think it is unfair to say that about Governor --WILLIAMS: Branstad?PERINO: Branstad.WILLIAMS: Yeah.PERINO: Because he was definitely saying, ""don't vote for Cruz."" But he was not saying...BOLLING: He said that?PERINO: That therefore not to vote for Trump. I think that Marco Rubio has a lot of appeal amongst a lot of republicans, and so...GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: I think that you will see him publicly...(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I just --GUTFELD: The worse in Branstad is, what a crony -- that is the most crony capitalistic thing you could you ever do. And that mean --WILLIAMS: Oh, you're a man of your word.GUTFELD: I know. I said --WILLIAMS: You're honest.GUTFELD: Ethanol subsidies. Come on, ethanol --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: That's the whole point.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: Final thought?GUILFOYLE: Iowa, Iowa, Iowa, Pork Queen. Here I come.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Stick on that.WILLIAMS: You got my vote.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, write-in.BOLLING: But Juan, how could you not at least see that there is a lot more that interest by people who haven't necessarily been political prior to this? You're seeing it (inaudible), right?PERINO: They're definitely new voters.BOLLING: Yeah, new voters, (inaudible).WILLIAMS: The question is. Do they come out? That's what the poll difference is our between...BOLLING: Of course, but why would they not? I mean, this is the big question I have that people are saying, well, this Trump thing is a phenomenon, but they won't show up.PERINO: I think they'll show up.BOLLING: They're as aggressive as anyone out there --PERINO: They waited for hours to see him at rallies. I don't see why they wouldn't show up on Fox News.WILLIAMS: No. You know, we said...GUILFOYLE: Correct. Good point.WILLIAMS: At this segment, we said that we use the word voters. They're not voters. They're caucus goers. You got to sit there, you got -- if the weather is bad you sit there...GUILFOYLE: Are not those the same people that have been lining up to fill halls...WILLIAMS: And I'm going to say something else...GUILFOYLE: And stand in line, waiting long hours...WILLIAMS: You know who come to Iowa caucuses?GUILFOYLE: In bad weather?WILLIAMS: People over 45.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: The Hairball.BOLLING: They're wrapping --WILLIAMS: What?BOLLING: They're wrapping --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Hairball. It's a heavy metal group.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yeah, Hairball.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: That's right. Ahead, an investigation into Planned Parenthood's alleged trafficking of fetal tissue results in indictments in Texas, but not for the abortion provider, for the people who exposed the operation that surprise, twist. And the undercover video makers defense, next on ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: It was a sunny expose, a series of undercover videos put out last year revealed that Planned Parenthood was not only aborting babies, but also trafficking their organs for profit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MELISSA FARRELL, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, PLANNED PARENTHOOD GULF COAST: So if we alter process and we are able to obtain intact fetal cadavers, then we can make it part of the budget, that any dissections are this and splitting the specimens into different shipments is this. I mean, that's -- it's all just a matter of line items.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: That launched congressional investigations, along with local ones. And yesterday, a surprising development out of Texas. A grand jury in Houston chose to indict two makers of those videos instead of Planned Parenthood, accusing them of tampering with a government record. Judge Nap is convinced politics were behind the indictment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS HOST: This sounds like a political hit job?JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS JUDICIAL ANALYST: Absolutely this is a political hit job. You used to practice law. I used to be on the bench. We both know that a skilled prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict anything. The favorite phrase is you can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich if you want. There's no judge; there's nobody there on the other side. We won't know what this prosecutor told the grand jury unless and until there's an actual criminal trial.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: One of the two facing felony charges is the founder of the Center for Medical Progress. In a statement, David Daleiden defended his group's actions, saying it uses the same undercover techniques that investigative journalists have used for decades. Planned Parenthood still cannot deny the admissions from their leadership about fetal organ sales captured on video for all the world to see.Dana, this is a shocking, surprising development.PERINO: Well, I think his statement a good one. It's something that I wanted to ask you. Like, how is this different from what ""60 Minutes"" or ""Dateline"" NBC has done for years?GUILFOYLE: Yes, ultimately, because this was just a grand jury indictment. I do not believe that he's going to be convicted. I don't think a felony charge and conviction would even hold up. So hopefully, some people that actually will listen. Look at the evidence. Understand the issues at play here. Will not try to make a political statement and, you know, use this person as some kind of a, you know, scapegoat.PERINO: And two other points. I just wanted to say that, you know, it did occur to me also that the Democrats and liberals really criticized the grand juries in New York and Baltimore in those cop cases. And they thought the grand juries were slanted. In this case, they love the grand juries. Right? So again, you know, they can only accept justice if it falls where they want it to on their checking the box column.The last thing I'd say is that they were selling human organs. You cannot -- every seller requires a willing buyer. So there was obviously something going on, and the trafficking of human organs is illegal.GUILFOYLE: Yes, and that's what he's saying. You can't escape the fact that they are doing this, it was illegal and that, subsequent to this investigation coming out, they changed their practices, because they knew what they were doing was wrong. And that, I think, is significant.Greg, you said what?GUTFELD: I wanted to add. You said what makes this different? Imagine if wasn't a media darling like Planned Parenthood. If this had been a sting for the NRA or a sting on the Catholic Church. The media would then be championing -- championing the investigators as heroes and condemning this indictment.But apparently, you can slice up a fetus but not like a driver's license.It's interesting, too, because the other difference is this was not a political sting. It was a moral sting. It wasn't out to, like, overturn Roe v. Wade or creates some kind of revolution, or get somebody elected. It was trying to shine a light on something about our civilization that stinks. And it was a moral sting. I don't think they even had any -- they were not trying to change anything. They were just trying to say, ""Take a look, America.""GUILFOYLE: This is happening, yes.Eric, were you surprised by this indictment? And what do you think's going to happen?BOLLING: And again, Judge Napolitano thinks this won't go any further than indictment. It probably won't go to a trial. And if they do, correct me if I'm wrong, but they're going after some sort of falsifying a driver's license as a way of getting this person to talk about it. And that's the extent of it.You point out something very important. Planned Parenthood stopped the practice of -- let me put it this way. Selling the body parts. They say they were just taking money to cover their cost of removing the fetal parts and transporting. Now they will not do it -- they'll hold the parts for another day, and they can sell them another day down the road if they wanted to.The whole issue is whether they were making a profit. They stopped doing the practice. That's good. The indictments came down. That's bad. But I think who end up going away, what they really should do is go after Planned Parenthood. What they were doing was illegal.GUILFOYLE: But how politically motivated? It's just really disgusting. Again, what about babies' lives? Shouldn't they matter? It's terrible.WILLIAMS: This is so one-sided.GUILFOYLE: A witch hunt.WILLIAMS: It just bothers me, because you know, eight states, after seeing all this, decline after seeing it. 11 states cleared Planned Parenthood.You ask, what's the difference between this and ""60 Minutes"" or a journalist? I can tell you as a journalist. You know what? People don't fake. You can't fake your identity, use fake I.D. You can't create fake companies. You don't use actors to go in and then create fake dialogue and set people up by asking leading questions. That's just not -- and so you know what? You say, this is political.Look, I tell you what. I have so much respect for people who oppose abortion rights. I think that -- I understand that fully. But if you're asking me, Greg, is it legal? Yes. The U.S. government, the American people have said it's legal to use fetal tissue for research purposes. And that's what was going on. There was never any fetal tissue sold for profit.BOLLING: There was. They claim it wasn't for profit.WILLIAMS: I'm telling you. It wasn't for profit.BOLLING: That woman on tape was just saying how they're going to separate the body parts of the fetuses. So they can sell more parts.GUILFOYLE: So they can make more money.WILLIAMS: What you're trying to do -- what you're trying to do is to give the scientific people what they're trying to get so they can deal with issues, ranging from everything from asthma -- to Parkinson's.GUTFELD: There's value in it. There's value in the tissue. Hooray. We admit it. There's some value there.GUILFOYLE: And it can also be done scientifically without chopping up babies. So how about that? Why don't you reach for a little bit of a higher moral, ethical ground instead of squandering, like in the dirt, in the mud like these people.WILLIAMS: So why did you report it...PERINO: Those child molesters, they didn't say, ""Hey, we're from 'Dateline' NBC. We're going to catch you trying to molest a child.""GUILFOYLE: Well, they're going to have to live with themselves.Next, we're going to go live to Iowa for a visit with ""Campaign Carl,"" is we didn't scare him away, ahead of the big announcement coming in moments on ""Special Report"" of the lineup of Thursday night's GOP debate. And we're going to be live in Iowa soon. That's right. See us there. Check it out. Tune in this Friday, Saturday and Monday. ""The Five"" goes to caucus country. We cannot wait, and you won't want to miss it.Back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: There's a big announcement coming soon on Thursday night's GOP debate. And you're only going to hear it on FOX News. The lineup for the 9 p.m. showdown will be revealed at 6 p.m. Eastern tonight on ""Special Report.""And as we wait for that, let's check in with Campaign Carl, live in Marshalltown, Iowa, where Senator Rubio campaigned today, and Donald Trump will be holding a rally shortly.Campaign Carl, you're very experienced in this. I have a quick question for you. Do you think conventional wisdom will hold or do you expect a surprise?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: All year it's been sort of a contradiction of conventional wisdom. So I think, for it to continue to do so, we would not be a surprise. The conventional wisdom is that, sooner or later, Trump will begin to falter. That has not happened.Although today, he did take a pretty serious hit. A number of women's pro- life groups have today come out, come forward and said that Donald Trump is unacceptable. The Conservative Women's Forum, Right to Life America, the Susan B. Anthony Organization, all women-oriented pro-life organizations have said that Donald Trump's past positions of pro-choice supporting abortion rights, and his treatment and demeanor towards women make him unacceptable.That's a big deal in Republican politics, and it comes literally on the two days before the debate and five days before, six days before the caucuses.So Trump will have -- Trump is going to have a news conference shortly and will be in a rally tonight. It will be very, very odd to hear Donald Trump attack those groups. But normally, when groups don't like him, that's what he does.PERINO: All right. Eric Bolling.BOLLING: So the criteria has been announced but the names have not. So tonight it's coming out, I guess, about 15 or 20 minutes. So 19 minutes. It looks like they'll be the top six nationally. Then you may add another one. I guess it would likely be Kasich for New Hampshire. So he'll come in the top five there.And then you may add yet another one. There could be an eighth player in Rand Paul if he comes in within the top five in the last five Iowa polls. Is that correct? So we could have six, seven or eight candidates?CAMERON: That sort of lays out the likely outcomes. We'll find out which outcome ultimately in a matter of minutes. But more candidates on the stage means less time for Donald Trump and more criticism, simply because he'll be center stage.And now virtually every one of his rivals is criticizing him. Whereas in the past debate, there have always been a few reluctant to.PERINO: All right, K.G.GUILFOYLE: So Carl, what about the enthusiasm level there? And what are you seeing in terms of likely, you know, caucus supporters, in terms of their enthusiasm for their particular candidate?CAMERON: So the Trump organization, they originally planned to have this at a hotel conference center. It was only going to hold about 400 people, so they moved it. It's a bigger crowd.This is not the kinds of thousands and thousands of people that Mr. Trump has had when he's gone to states that aren't voting in February. But this is a very, very sizable crowd for the Iowa caucuses. And the intensity is real.Voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have been peppered by pollsters, subjected to endless attack ads on their TV sets. And frankly, they're getting a little tired of it, and they're eager to vote.And just about everybody you talk to in Iowa has a first choice, a second choice and in many cases a third choice. Because that's the way caucuses go. You can have a second bite at the apple if your candidate doesn't perform well.And in New Hampshire, it's the same way. In Trump audiences, there are often political tourists. Here in the central part of Iowa, there are folks who have come from Montana, from Illinois, and Indiana, all just to see him and watch the caucuses. Their states don't vote until much later.But it gives you an idea that some of the support for Donald Trump is political tourism. Some of it is people who just like a celebrity. And then there are those who plan to caucus and vote for him. And how that breaks out could determine who wins what.PERINO: We only have 30 seconds left or so. Juan Williams.WILLIAMS: So if I was a political tourist, I'd come see Campaign Carl. That's what I'd do.But Carl, let me ask you about two people we haven't mentioned. Ben Carson, Marco Rubio. Carson looks to be cratering to me. Am I wrong? And Rubio, could he separate himself from the rest of the establishment pack behind Trump and Cruz?CAMERON: Yes, Rubio is certainly trying to be that third ticket out of Iowa, recognizing that Trump and Cruz seem to be in a sort of a two-man race. They'll come in one, two, two, one.But Rubio will be in third, which sets him apart from the rest of the pack. That's a big deal for him.On the other hand, the idea that you can win the nomination by being third is a problem that Rubio is going to have to face soon. Because he's in second or third in New Hampshire, second or third in South Carolina. Sooner or later, he's going to have win somewhere.Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, it will be a late night this coming Monday here, but one of those two is still likely to win the caucuses which is -- which changes the dynamic for every state thereafter. You know that.PERINO: All right. Gutfeld.GUTFELD: Any suggestions for bars?CAMERON: Bars?GUTFELD: Yes, out there.CAMEROTA: Well, there's plenty of them Des Moines. The problem with coming out and staying in Des Moines is that's not where Republican candidates do the bulk of their campaigning. They come out to the more rural areas of the state, particularly the central Northwest, where the conservatives vote. If you're looking to go to a Hillary or a Bernie event, you'll probably do OK around Des Moines.GUTFELD: Very good, way to take a nonsensical question and get a practical answer.GUILFOYLE: That was so Trip Adviser.PERINO: Campaign Carl, we're going to be there be on Friday. So we'll see you there.Also, do you want to be happier and healthier? Live closer to somewhere that serves alcohol.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Norm!WOODY HARRELSON, ACTOR: Hey, Mr. Peterson, Jack Frost nipping at your nose?GEORGE WENDT, ACTOR: Yes. Now I need Joe Beer nipping at my liver, huh?(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Norm from ""Cheers."" He always went to a place where everybody knew his name. He seemed like a happy guy, right?Well, a new study says living near a pub does make you happy and can improve your overall health. Those who enjoy a pint close to home, and they have more friends. That sounds like a good excuse to drink up. Especially if you're Greg Gutfeld.GUTFELD: Why would you come to me first?WILLIAMS: You asked the question of Campaign Carl about where can we drink?GUTFELD: Yes. The upside is there's no drunk driving if you live near a pub. You can walk or stagger home. The bad news is your front yard becomes a restroom and a motel room for drunks.The other thing, too, is the real tragedy of pubs is when they banned smoking. Because the tobacco smoke camouflaged -- camouflaged the stench of an old pub.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: And it does stink in there. So once everybody stops smoking, you smell the stale beer, among other things.PERINO: True. Good point.WILLIAMS: The good news is they say that, if you have a local pub, you are less likely to drink excessively.PERINO: Well, and the other thing it said in the study is that having that companionship, being able to go down and see a few friends like they did on ""Cheers,"" that that's probably the most beneficial thing. It's not just the alcohol.But in England, one of the things I loved about living there was that you could take your dog to the pub, as well. Yes.GUILFOYLE: Gosh.PERINO: And that was fabulous.GUTFELD: The smoking would cover up the smell of the dog.PERINO: The dog doesn't smell. My dog does not smell.GUTFELD: Did you ever go to a British pub. I used to go to the pub every day. It stunk like dog.WILLIAMS: Eric.GUILFOYLE: It didn't stop you from going back. Day after day after night after night. Yes.WILLIAMS: Eric, it says, though, that friendship is really so important for good health and long life. And it says the way to maintain a friendship is face to face. Not on e-mail, not on the phone. And a pub, you're face to face.GUILFOYLE: I like that.BOLLING: We go to this pub right over here all the time, have a beer once in a while, right, have a cocktail. I think it's a great idea. I agree with Greg, though, that it can benefit you that you don't have to drive in the car and drive -- or worse, get in a cab in New York City.WILLIAMS: What's it like -- what's it like for a beautiful woman to go into a local pub?GUTFELD: I don't know.GUILFOYLE: Not fabulous.What? What did you just say?Wow! OK. It can be friendly. It can be friendly.GUTFELD: You can't go into bars, can you?GUILFOYLE: I can.WILLIAMS: All right. ""One More Thing"" up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: We're back for ""One More Thing."" Juan.WILLIAMS: Well, last week some people in Gainesville, Florida, complained about neighborhood kids playing basketball too loudly in the driveway.But the cop showed up and they said, ""We're coming back and we're going to get some help."" They brought in a friend on Saturday, and that friend was Shaquille O'Neal. Oh, my God. Shaquille O'Neal shows up and he starts playing with the cops with the neighborhood kids. A great deal of fun.But you know what? The video of this which I must say, all credit to Shaquille O'Neal and the police. They did not invite the media. But this video then got played by 14 million people across America. It went viral. Good news for police community relations.PERINO: I like it.GUTFELD: Where are we?BOLLING: He got big this way, too.COLLING: OK. So this was just an amazing video. I was, like, I wasn't going to do it. People like to hate on Twitter. But go for it. You hate on me some more. Check it out, when this little girl Ava spoke. Watch where she's going to go.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are going to see Donald Trump in person. In New Hampshire.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you serious?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. Are you excited?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FE: You get to go see him in person. Not on TV.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you!UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh! Are you excited?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You want to meet him? Tell Mr. Trump you want to meet him.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love you, Trump!(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I hope he calls her up. They better go backstage.BOLLING: He should. By the way, she's going to be on ""FOX and Friends"" tomorrow morning. If I were him, I would grab her...GUILFOYLE: Absolutely. Helicopter ride. Helicopter ride.BOLLING: What I was going to do was set it up. This is definitely not Dana. That no, you'd better not do that.PERINO: I would have laughed.GUTFELD: All right. Politics, politics. Last night they had the town hall. It was pretty uneventful. Afterwards, Bernie Sanders left. It was dark out. He got a little lost. We have this, these photos of him. He ended up getting stuck on a traffic island.And luckily, there were some police officers there that we were able to find Mr. Sanders and get him home. Actually, that's a little sloth in Ecuador that crossed a highway and then got terrified. And they saved the little guy.PERINO: Aww.GUILFOYLE: They should name him Greg.GUTFELD: Oh!GUILFOYLE: A striking resemblance.GUTFELD: We do look alike.GUILFOYLE: So cute.GUTFELD: I like hanging upside-down.GUILFOYLE: That's how you hang on the tree outside my window.GUTFELD: That is true.PERINO: Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: OK. Well, it's always time for cheese, isn't it? Well, some people like cheese. And if I were a salami suspect, I'd be the first suspect. But $70,000 worth of stolen cheese was recovered, but $90,000 of delicious cheese still missing in Wisconsin.The police department is all over it. Here is my delightful dish. I dare you. I challenge you to try and steal the cheese for the ""The Five""? And what does ""The Five"" like?GUTFELD: The cheddar. I love the cheddar.GUILFOYLE: A double order of the cheddar. So I'm really appreciative of the police recovering all of that cheese. The problem is, they cut out the parmesan.PERINO: Miss Perino?PERINO: Well, in about less than a minute you're going to see Bret Baier on ""Special Report."" And one of the things he talked about last night was the FOX News 2016 election H.Q. app. It's a pretty cool thing. I went and downloaded it. You can interact with him on Wednesday nights. He's going to talk about how the week has gone and you can, you know, find out a little bit more about your candidates. You can do a little bit of checking in on the polls, things like that so you can never miss a moment. And in just, like, 20 seconds, you're going to find out who made the debate stage.GUTFELD: Now it's 18 seconds, Dana.GUILFOYLE: Now 14 seconds, oh, my God.GUTFELD: Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of ""The Five.""That's it for us. ""Special Report"" is up in nine seconds.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" June 24, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST:  Breaking tonight, in a move sending shockwaves around the world.  One of America's most important allies parts ways with the European Union in what appears to be a show of frustration over immigration, economic opportunity, and the inability to control their own lives.  Sound familiar?  Welcome to the ""Kelly File.""  I'm Megyn Kelly.This vote has divided Europe, caused a huge hit in stock markets around the world and raised new questions about global security and it hasn't even been 24 hours.  Perhaps more importantly, it has sent a stunning message to political leaders, pollsters and pundits who never thought this would happen, happen.  And part of that message is how the immigration issue drove the voters who were told by the so-called elites not to worry about immigration.Britain is a relatively small country.  With a population of just 65 million, they've never been completely comfortable with the E.U., but as immigration exploded, so did worries there about housing, medical care, jobs, and the changing British culture.  Last year alone some 630,000 immigrants arrived, 630,000.  If the trend continues, Britain's population will top 70 million over the next decade with about half of that coming from other countries.While the folks who argued to stay with the E.U. said it's better for England's economy, that apparently did not match up with what some of these folks are experiencing in their daily lives.In moments, we will here from Nile Gardiner who predicted some of this would happen.  He served as special advisor to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  Frank Lutz is here just back in the U.K. with the message Americans should take away.  His final poll predicted this exact result.  He was one of the few.  But we begin tonight with Benjamin Hall reporting from London on how all of this came to pass.  Benjamin?BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good evening, Megyn.  Last night, Britain voted to take back control of their borders, their immigration policy, some even say their country and their economy from the nameless politicians in Brussels.  It was the biggest voter turnout in U.K. history.  Seventy percent of people turned out and the result, although very close, has changed the face of Europe forever.  At its core with the decision to leave the E.U., a body of 28 European countries with one shared government to which billions of dollars is paid every year. That unelected government set many of Britain's laws.  Prime Minister David Cameron who had pushed to stay in and originally call this out was supposed to resign this morning after he lost.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID CAMERON, PRIME MINISTER OF UNITED KINGDOM:  The British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path.  And as such, I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.(END VIDEO CLIP)HALL:  For years, a politician named Nigel Farage led a small group of British conservatives fighting against the growing power of the European government.  Today, he was celebrating victory along with others.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NIGEL FARAGE, BRITISH POLITICIAN AND HEAD OF THE U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY:  It's the victory for ordinary people, decent people.  It's a victory against the big merchant banks, against the big businesses and against big politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)HALL:  One of the major issues was immigration.  Millions of people have been flooding into Europe with access to benefits, yet it was the European government took control over Britain's immigrant policy.  Even President Obama has had weighed in urging Britain to stay inside the European government, delivering what was widely seen as a veiled threat if they left.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  And U.K. is going to be in the back of the queue.(END VIDEO CLIP)HALL:  There was a real backlash against this intervention.  People were asking what right he had to come and tell the people of the U.K. how to vote.  But other than that, there has been a downturn in the economy at the moment.  But people are saying that that short-term trouble at the moment may be a price worth paying for freedom.  Megyn?KELLY:  Benjamin, a lot of people are wondering why did the British Prime Minister have to step down.  I mean he suffered a defeat, but why did he have to step down?HALL:  Well, he campaigned very strongly for this.  He believed that Britain was better in.  And now they voted to leave, there are negotiations going on with Europe which will redefine where England stands in the future and he felt he was not in a position having campaigned so strongly on behalf of Europe that he could no longer be in the position as prime minister and lead the country forward in the direction it had chosen to vote which was a different direction altogether.  So this morning, he made that decision and he resigned.KELLY:  He's gone as of October.  Benjamin, great to see you.  Thank you.So some of the folks who voted to remain with the European Union were pretty harsh in their reaction to the opposition calling them racist, stupid, and some other words we can't use on television.Our next guest is one of the folks on the receiving end of some of that anger.  Nile Gardiner is the Director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom.  He served as a special advisor to Lady Thatcher and he was a big supporter of the effort to leave the E.U.  Nile, good to see you.So We've seen this today.NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION'S MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM:  Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY:  If you were in favor of leaving the E.U, you're stupid.  And Charles Cook had an interesting piece out today talking about how his very smart friends have said, are you sure you would be in favor of leaving?   All the smart people are in favor of staying.  And we've seen a lot of that same disdain in our country now depending on what political side of the spectrum you're on.  So why did you think it was a good idea, and what do you think Margaret Thatcher would have wanted?GARDINER:  Well, Megyn, I think Brexit is a great development for Britain.  It's very good for the U.K., it's good Europe, it's good for the United States.  This is all about freedom and self-determination, British people retaking control of their own country.  And after over 40 years as members of the European Union, it was time for Britain to declare its own independence.The E.U. has become a separate national entity that suffocates sovereignty and freedom.  And the British people voted in huge numbers yesterday to basically declare their independence from the E.U.  That's a fantastic development.  And this is all about, you know, retaking control for Britain, advancing democracy, advancing economic liberty and freedom, and it's also about, I think, the return of Great Britain on the world stage as a true world power.  And I think .KELLY:  What about -- let's talk about the money.GARDINER:  . that Britain has a tremendous amount of benefit for the United Kingdom.KELLY:  The U.K. is one of 10-member states who pay more into the E.U. budget than they get out.  Just only France and Germany contribute more.  And so the E.U. is paying all these money into the, you know, the Great Britain is paying all this money into the E.U. budget, and Poland is getting all the benefit.  Hungary is getting a lot of benefits.  Greece is getting a lot of benefits.  Why did the Britain -- why did the British folks who supported staying think that was OK?GARDINER:  Well, I mean, I think it's, you know, sort of beggar's belief that, you know, people would think that it's good for Britain to hand over 20 billion pounds a year and just get 10 billion pounds back.  Basically, the European Union is a large sort of socialist style redistribution system.  It's really an economic basket case in very deep decline.  Britain has been subsidizing the European Union for many, many decades.  And enough is enough.As Margaret Thatcher said, you know, the European Project is perhaps the greatest folly of the modern era.  And what the British people have done is basically throw a lifeboat off the Titanic and they jump on board in that lifeboat.  And the Titanic is heading only in one direction, toward a massive iceberg.  And that's where the E.U. is headed.  It's an institution in very deep decline.  It's run by faceless unaccountable bureaucrats, and there's a deep disillusionment with the, not only in Britain but across Europe as well.  And I'm in no doubt that Brexit will spark a series of referendums across Europe, and you are going to see people all over the European continent expressing their disdain for the European Union.KELLY:  What about -- we're already hearing that there may be some disdain for England.  You know, already, there's some rumblings that Scotland may now want out of the U.K, perhaps Northern Ireland.  I mean, what kind of effect did that have if it happens, because they wanted to stay in the E.U?GARDINER:  Yeah, certainly.  I think the Scotts are the most pro-E.U. among all of the British people.  And certainly, there's a renewed call for referendum on Scottish independence.  But I think the Scotts should bear this in mind that if they decide to leave the United Kingdom, they, of course, would have to, anyway, apply to join the European Union.  They'd also have to apply to join the NATO alliance.  And Spain has already said that they would definitely veto any Scottish application because of their own separatist internal problems.  And the Scotts would be completely on their own.But, you know, the vast majority of British people, I think, really want, you know, really want to see change.  And, you know, this referendum of the European Union was all about, you know, political change, it's all about reasserting sovereignty and self-determination.  These are, you know, universal principles that the American people are cherished so deeply.  And I think that Brexit is, you know, is wonderful news for Britain.  It's wonderful news for America as well.  It's going to advance prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic based upon, you know, economic liberty and political freedom.KELLY:  Nile, great to see you.  Thank you.GARDINER:  Great to see you, Megyn.  Thank you.KELLY:  Well, the success of the leave E.U. movement is being traced to one of its leading voices.  Nigel Farage is a wealthy businessman turned leader of the U.K.'s Independence Party.  And he is the man credited with championing Britain's break from the E.U.  Now parallels are being drawn between Farage and Donald Trump and the issues the two men put in front of the voters.  Watch when we compared remarks from both men this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Our country lost its way when it stopped putting the American people really first.FARAGE:  Dare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom.  This will be a victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people.TRUMP:  We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism, focusing on what's good for America's middle class, to a policy of globalism.FARAGE:  We fought against the multinationals, we fought against the big merchant banks.TRUMP:  It's not just our economy that's been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.FARAGE:  We fought against big politics, we fought against lies, corruption and deceit.  Let June the 23rd go down in our history as our independence day.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLEY:  Joining me now, someone who knows full well how messaging influences voters, pollster, Frank Luntz.  Frank, good to see you.  And so you actually were polling this thing.  You actually had it right.  You had the leavers two points ahead of the remainers.  And that's exactly how it turned out.  What was it?  Why did all the other pollsters underestimate the strength of the leave movement?FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER:  Two reasons, number one, they could not predict turnout.  The fact that this the  highest percentage of Brits that have ever voted in an election, even more than voted for prime minister last year, is significant.  And the higher the turnout, the better the leave campaign did.  And second is that they were unable to project those final 10 percent of 12 percent that were moving at the end.Megyn, over 90 percent of the British population had decided more than two weeks in advance how they were going to vote.  That last 10 % in the end voted with leave, and the reason why is because the remain campaign did not personalize, individualize, or humanize the election.  They talked about Britain overall rather than talking about the average, hardworking taxpayer.  The leave campaign was much more effective at personalizing it, and more emotional in its appeal.KELLY:  ""The Wall Street Journal"" had a write up today talking about some certain individuals who voted to leave including -- a lot of these were Democrats, it was working class Democrats who really made it happen.  And they were talking about how it's socialized medicine over there, how they go into the hospitals.  And one guy's wife had to wait 10 weeks to get a pain shot.  She had to wait 10 weeks before she can get a shot to relieve the pain in her backs.  These people are not -- understandably, they're not welcoming an influx of 650,000 immigrants.  That's just more people on the roster, more people they have to fight for housing with.  Forget jobs because they're doing OK on unemployment, but it's much more than jobs over there.LUNTZ:  Yes, and it's also about a government that has lost control, a European government that does not understand that its bureaucracy is destroying the hopes and dreams of the population that it supposed to serve.  The number one complaint other than immigration was this faceless, nameless, European bureaucracy that just made life more difficult for the British people.You'd be amazed that what I'm listening to over there, over the last 72 hours, is exactly what I'm hearing here in America.  It is so much of the Trump campaign that the public has had enough.  And I would say if I were advising the Clinton campaign, that you better not represent the status quo, because people across Europe and across America have had it, Megyn.   They're fed up with politics as usual, fed up with being ignored by the politicians and fed up with not having a voice and running their own lives.KELLY:  The messaging is, you know, very, very similar on both sides, although, I will say that the leavers in Great Britain, they don't have anything like Donald Trump's free trade policy.  I mean they want more .LUNTZ:  But they have shirts like this either, I will tell you that.KELLY:  What does it say on the bottom?  Vote leave?LUNTZ:  Vote leave.  And, Megyn, I'm not even allowed to show you this.   And I'm not even sure if I should tell you this, but they were even .KELLY:  What's coming next?LUNTZ:  They were even giving away condoms that communicated the vote leave campaign.  I won't tell you what they said, but we'll put it on your website so people can come and take a look after this is over.KELLY:  I'm going to have to consult my friend, Mr. Google.  Pull out?  OK.   James says he has the dirty reference because, you know, he has a dirty mind.  It's great to see you, Frank.  Thank you for that.LUNTZ:  Thank you.  I'm glad he showed that because I thought it was just one of two fuzzy dice that Frank always -- you know, that's what he usually has underneath his coat.  So tonight is different.So what do the Clinton camps and the Trump camps think of this idea that the British vote carries a message for the White House race? David Wohl and Richard Fowler are next on that.  Plus, what does this change mean for the terror threat in Europe and around the world?  We're going to put that question to former extremis, Maajid Nawaz, and to General Joaquin (ph).   Don't go away.  This is important.CAMERON:  This is worth asking the question, which -- you know, who would be happy if we left?  Putin might be happy, I suspect al-Baghdadi might be happy.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Breaking tonight, new political fallout here at home after the Brits vote to leave the European Union.  Remember, our reporter in London talked at the top of the hour about the backlash after President Obama weighed in with this just two months ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA:  Our focus is in negotiating with a big block of the European Union to get a trade agreement done.  And U.K. is going to be in the back of a queue.  Given the heavy lift on any trade agreement, us having access to a big market with a lot of countries rather than trying to do piecemeal trade agreements is hugely inefficient.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  They were not persuaded.  Then today, Hillary Clinton suggesting the U.K. Vote is bad for the U.S and using the opportunity to make a case for her own presidency.  Her statement reading, ""This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House.""For his part, Donald Trump traveling in Scotland today, called the voter rejection of the policies about Mrs. Clinton and President Obama.TRUMP:  He's constantly dictating to the world what they should to do.  The world doesn't listen to him.  Obviously, you can see that by the vote.  But he's constantly dictating to other countries.  She shouldn't have done it.  And I actually think that his recommendation, perhaps, caused it to fail.What do you think this says about how Hillary Clinton maybe has misread the world?Well, she has always misread everything.  I mean, she misread this.  And I was surprised that she was so bold and .(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining us now, David, an attorney and Donald Trump supporter, and Richard Fowler who's a nationally syndicated radio talk show host and senior fellow at the New Leaders Council. Good to see you both.So, Richard, many people today have come out and said this bodes very well for Donald Trump, it doesn't bode well for Hillary Clinton, that Trump and his supporters are more aligned with, you know, the sentiment behind the leave moment -- movement which prevailed.  Does it cause you any concern as a Hillary supporter?RICHARD FOWLER, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO TALK SHOW HOST AND SENIOR FELLOW AT THE NEW LEADERS COUNCIL:  For sure.  I think this is a ripple effect.  And I think the Lord speaks to us in sign that it's time for Democrats to stop thinking that, you know, Donald Trump is not this crazy - - he is a crazy outsider and all of his policies are horrible.  Mark Zandi told us that.  But he has an opportunity here to win this thing if we don't get out there and get active.  And what you're seeing from the party is not that.I think today at the platform committee, they rejected a living wage amendment which is absolutely the opposite of what we should be doing.  We should be promoting living wages.  We should be talking to poor, middle class whites, poor middle class African-Americans, poor middle class Hispanics and saying get in the game, get in the process.  Donald Trump's policies are horrible for you and this election matters.  And I think that's what we've got to do absolutely immediately.  And this should be a warning sign that Rome is indeed burning and it's time for Democrats to get up and get active, or Donald Trump will be the president.  Scary.KELLY:  So that's a message we are hearing.  It's not just Richard, David.  He says Donald Trump is crazy.  I think he calls Hillary crazy.  I can't remember what his nickname is, corruptor or whatever.  But she came out tonight with another statement that said, you know, pay attention, suggesting Donald Trump can win.  And you're hearing this more and more from the left today saying, they need to take this as a warning to get behind her, and more particularly, to open up their pocketbooks to help her.DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY:  Yeah, I mean, the Megyn, the Brexit vote was nothing short of a wholesale rejection of the Clinton, Cameron, Obama globalist agenda.  I mean people are sick and tired that they're mad as hell, and they're not going to take it anymore.  How many people need to flood into the country, how many terrorist events like San Bernardino, Paris, Orlando, have to take place before people can finally say, OK, stop, enough?  And this mirror's Mr. Trump's policy on immigration. He simply wants a system of vetting, a system of screening that is comprehensive, accurate, and will stop people from hot beds of Islamic terrorism who are predisposed to this type of behavior from coming to America.  What a concept.  The Britons had it right.  They're not -- they're not protected by the E.U.(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  And what we've seen here though, Richard, you tell me because over there, the polling had it very tight although they thought that England would stay, you know, in the E.U.  Here, Hillary Clinton has been beating Donald Trump steadily in virtually all of the polls.  So if the pollsters have it wrong now, they're way wrong.  I mean, they're all wrong.  Granted we still have four months to the election, but does that give you any -- and does that make you feel better after you get over your concern?FOWLER:  I mean a little better.  But here's the thing.  You have to look -- it's too early to look at nationwide polls.  You have to look at state by state polls, right?  So you look at a state like Ohio where Donald Trump, even in his baddest week, is tied with Hillary Clinton.  And the reason why, one, I think pollsters aren't talking to the right people.  But, two, you have to make sure that the campaign is mobilizing the right people.  You got to be mobilizing young people to go on a vote, a mistake that stay in E.U. team made over in London, right, or in United Kingdom.  You got to make sure that .KELLY:  Yeah, people are still holding onto Bernie.  They're not .FOWLER:  Yeah, exactly.  They're holding onto Bernie because of his ideals which is what the party needs to shift to and the Hillary Clinton .KELLY:  Bernie is out there saying he's going to vote for Hillary, and the young people are like, no.FOWLER:  He is going to vote for Hillary but he was .WOHL:  His followers aren't going to go along with that.  They don't buy into Hillary's platform.FOWLER:  But they're not so ever .WOHL:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let me .KELLY:  Let David finish.  No, let David finish, let David finish.  Go ahead, David.WOHL:  Yeah, I mean the followers of Bernie are radicals.  They're sort of leftists.  They're not going to jump on board.  And I'm telling you what, when it comes down to some of the issues such as national security, I think they care about that.  I really do, and the economics of keeping jobs.   They care about jobs.  They are going to be -- in the last poll I saw something like 20 percent to 30 percent potentially jump will Mr. Trump.  I think even Richard will by the end because Hillary is going to have so many problems with her federal investigation, Megyn.  The guy who put her I.T. - - the I.T. -- the server into her home just took a fifth a 130 times when they questioned Hillary.  I'm her lawyer, I'm going to tell her to the fifth.  If she does, that's the end of her campaign.FOWLER:  David, you're the .KELLY:  You will be .FOWLER:  David, you're the best I've seen.  You're the best I've seen.WOHL:  Richard .KELLY:  If Richard goes to support Trump, he'll be in and I think it's a 4 percent of African-Americans who are in favor of Donald Trump.  It's like 96 percent are against Donald Trump.FOWLER:  Don't worry.  It's not going to happen.  It's not going to happen.KELLY:  You'll let us know.FOWLER:  It's not going to happen.KELLY:  All right, great to see you both.FOWLER:  Good to see you.KELLY:  So within hours of the vote, the Islamic state terror group was celebrating and calling for new attacks in Europe.  Former extremists, Maajid Nawaz and General Joaquin (ph) are here on what this means for Europe and the United States and security.Plus this drama may not end with Britain.  Remember the women assaulted in Germany?  The terror worries in Brussels?  Up next, why more countries may bolt the E.U. and what that could mean.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Breaking today, a closer look at Great Britain's historic vote to leave the European Union.  And this might not be the only farewell faced by the continent.  Remember the anger after women were assaulted by immigrants in Germany, the worries about terror in the hot bed of Brussels?  Could even more countries abandon the E.U., and what would that mean?  Doug McKelway reports tonight from Washington.  Doug?DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Britain's exit from the European Union is already igniting a fire than has been smoldering across Europe. Populous and right leaning forces in France, for example, have been gaining strength and are calling for their own exit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (TRANSLATED):  The French as well must have the opportunity to choose the way to freedom that will give back to France its full and entire sovereignty.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCKELWAY:  Polls show a majority of the Dutch want to put an E.U. exit to a vote.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm very jealous and I'm trying to achieve the same in The Netherlands next year.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCKELWAY:  Interested in the European Union break up has spawned a tidal wave of Brexit variations including, 'Italeave, Szechout, Austria La Vista, Finish, Slovakout, and Departugal.'As in the U.S., Europe is rebelling against what millions see as government by the elites. Critics say rather than simplify Europe's regulatory structure in its 23-year existence, the E.U. government in Brussels has added layers of bureaucracy and regulation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's a sense of malaise that the European Union is not working. And part of the reason why it's not working is because Europe is overregulated. Power has been increasingly centralized in Brussels.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCKELWAY:  Europe is unease also mirrors U.S. worries over uncontrolled immigration, the result in crime, terror threats and failure by some population to assimilate into the broader cultures.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  People want to see borders. They don't necessarily want people pouring into their country that they don't know who they and where they come from. They have no idea.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCKELWAY:  There's a frustration over economic decline and influence, and resentment that the more productive E.U. economies like Britain and Germany have had to bail out the weaker ones like Greece. The votes that put the Brexit over the top, came from Britain's equivalent of the U.S. Midwestern rust belt. How many other nation ride this anti-elite wave were likely to depend on whether the British economy does well on its own over the long term.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If that happens, more and more countries will look at the British example and say, we can do that too.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCKELWAY:  Critics warn that Britain is risking its economy in today's competitive international market without the auspices of the E.U. But Britain has a very long history of thriving in international trade, having been its leader for parts of the 18th, 19th, and parts of 20th century. Megyn, back to you.KELLY:  Doug, thank you. Joining me now with more, Rich Lowry, Fox News contributor and editor of National Review. And Alan Colmes who is host of the Alan Colmes show on Fox News radio.Good to see you both.ALAN COLMES, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST:  Hi. Hi, Megyn.KELLY:  So, Rich, tell me how big a role, what we've seen in Europe with the immigration, and particularly from Syria and elsewhere, and Angela Merkel letting a million refugees come in, how much did that play?RICH LOWRY, NATIONAL REVIEW EDITOR:  I think it was a pretty big role. Angela Merkel in effect issued an invitation to any migrant or refugee who can get to Europe to come on in. And because the E.U. has eliminated borders throughout much of Europe, once you set foot in one European country, you can walk into any other.And we have learned from the experience of France that European countries are not particularly good at assimilating large numbers of Muslim immigrants, and the experience of France and Belgium is that ethnic enclaves not just terror at their fabric of civil society, they can actually be dangerous.KELLY:  Alan, the reports are that not only were, you know, some rich migrant migrants, this is from the Atlantic today, out buying British buys for the best properties, but poor migrants were willing to crowd much more densely into dwellings than British foreign people were.And so, the neighborhoods were actually changing to the consternation of those who were British born.COLMES:  Well, that's the problem. And you're hitting on why this really happened. I think it was scare tactics, fear. The immigrants are coming. The refugees are coming.KELLY:  But the scare tactics and fear or is it facts in a neighborhood that's irritating?COLMES:  It's fear. Because we found out in the United States, for example, people do assimilate. When Donald Trump says Muslims don't assimilate nor our culture. That's a lie. The FBI said it was a lie. People have assimilated certainly secondly generate to that.(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Have you been to Paris recently?COLMES:  People assimilate over time. It doesn't happen right way. Assimilation happens. And that's the way of the world. We don't live in a narrow society. We live in a global society and people have to get used to that.LOWRY:  Well, assimilation is not inevitable.(CROSSTALK)COLMES:  It is.LOWRY:  In the larger numbers you have, the harder it is to assimilate, and Alan, we've seen in these attacks in Paris and Belgium, very often it's second generation immigrants, which I assume you believe must have inevitably assimilated. But they didn't.And there's a matter of principle here. Britain should get to decide whether they want more immigrants, less immigrants, same amount of immigrants, a different mix of immigrants. That is for Britain to decide itself, not to have it imposed by a European super state.And what the leave forces were talking about is adapting an Australian style so-called points system where you get to choose the kind of immigrants that you think would help you and have the right skills for your economy.(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  What about that, Alan?LOWRY:  There is nothing wrong with that. That's rational.KELLY:  Because what they're saying now today -- what they're saying now today is that if Hillary Clinton pursues a message that sounds anything like Angela Merkel, she's going to lose.COLMES:  This has nothing to do with the United States election. One was a vote on an issue. This is a vote on candidates. Donald Trump, for him to win, based on Brexit, would have to expand the people he's appealing to, and the appeal of Brexit just like the appeal of Trump is to older less educated white lower income people, and he's not expanding to blacks ro women to Hispanics, which is what he would need to do to brought...(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  And how about the lower educated.COLMES:  That's what the statistics...KELLY:  What about that, Rich, because it is true that England...COLMES:  That's what the Pew study show.KELLY:  ... it is true that England is I think 86 percent white. The United States is not 86 percent white. It has much higher population than minorities.(CROSSTALK)LOWRY:  Yes, the demographics are -- the demographics are different. There's no doubt about it.KELLY:  And so the election looks different.LOWRY:  But the left plays a double game. When working class folks vote the way they won't, they're all manta size as hard working, salt of the earth and all the rest of it. When they vote the wrong way, the way they did in Britain, because a lot of the folks who voted for Brexit are labor supporters of the working class, then they're these racist goons and these backwards people. I think that's frankly disgusting.COLMES:  I didn't say that. That's not my point of view.LOWRY:  The people that have -- that have patriotic impulses they want to defend their country and they want to have national decisions affecting Britain decided by the British Parliament.COLMES:  They're voting...(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  I got to leave it that.COLMES:  ... they're voting against their best interest. It happened to the United States. Look at the economy. Look at how the pound sank today. Look at the stock market...LOWRY:  It's one day.COLMES:  People's savings, their 401k's. They're hurting themselves.KELLY:  I'll get to get to that. I'm going to get to that later with Steven Moore. He's going to tell us whether we should all sell all of our retirement investments. Do you have any? I don't know. It's like you put it in a 401 and then you hope and pray. That's what you're supposed to do.Great to see you both. We'll have more momentarily.COLMES:  Thank you, Megyn.KELLY:  So, we're also seeing new worries tonight about the fact that ISIS is now celebrating this vote and using it as call for more attacks. Former extremists Maajid Nawaz and General Jack Keane are here next on that.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Well, there's some growing terror concerns among some tonight with England leaving the E.U. Today, ISIS was reportedly expressing joy, ISIS expressing joy, and calling on its followers who carry out attacks to, quote, ""paralyze Europe.""That has a lot of folks wondering how this move is going to affect global security.Former Islamic extremist, Maajid Nawaz, and Fox News military analyst General Jack Keane are here in a moment. But first, we go to Trace Gallagher, live in the Europe with more. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, what ISIS is calling on its followers to strike at the heart of Europe. The European Union's law enforcement agency, Europol says Brexit has the potential to harm the U.K.'s ability to fight terrorism.Because the Brits would no longer have direct access to the Schengen information system, that's the E.U.'s vast intelligence database. Europol claims to be actively working on more than 50 counterterrorism cases and says British police have come to rely heavily on their information.But remember, the E.U. is vulnerable because one of its bedrock principles is to be able to cross borders without checkpoints, allowing some 400 million people to roam free. Last August, there were many calls for the E.U. to tighten its borders in the wake of an attempted terror attack on a Paris bound train. That attack was halted by three American tourists.But the attackers themselves were able to freely cross two borders before getting on the train. Then in November, the ring leader of the Paris attacks that killed 130 was able to go from Belgium to Paris, conduct the attack then returned to his apartment in Brussels where he hold up for more than four months before being arrested.Investigators believe the same terrorist cell that attacked Paris was behind the attacks in Brussels in March that killed 31. Experts also point out that European privacy laws often limit authorities in different countries from sharing information. In other words, while citizens can travel freely from country to country, their information often cannot. Megyn?KELLY:  Trace, thank you. Joining me now with reaction, Maajid Nawaz, a former Islamic extremist, and author of ""Radical, My Journey out of Islamic Extremism"". Maajid, good to see you tonight. So, do you think this makes us less secure, I mean, us meaning America and the U.K. less secure or more secure?MAAJID NAWAZ, FORMER ISLAMIC EXTREMIST:  Well, I think there's a potential. I heard that word mentioned in the report. There is a potential, Megyn, that our cooperation with our European partners will suffer, and of course that has no effects.However, I would like to emphasize my organization, Quilliam is a counter terrorism organization we just published prior to the vote, a report looking at this very question. And we interviewed people from security experts from across the spectrum of opinion on this.What we found is actually primarily our counterterrorism efforts in the United Kingdom rely on three issues. The first is what's known as the five highest countries for cooperation. That's Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, those English language speaking countries.That's where the bulk of our intelligence sharing comes from. The second aspect is the bilateral cooperation with France because of the (Inaudible) Calais relationship at the border that is necessary, and the third, frankly, is the expertise of our security services.The MI5 and MI6 that are some of the best in the world. So, though it may have an impact, I don't think it's going to have a lasting impact on our ability to defend off terror attacks. And in fact, I think the cooperation by sheer necessity is going to continue with continents in Europe.(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Yes. I mean, the U.K. is among the best in the world at this. But what about culturally? What effect does this have, sort of the more isolationist principles and the pushback against immigrants, and sort of the retreat to, you know, within borders?NAWAZ:  Yes. Well, look, I voted for us to remain in the European Union. My primary reason was this point you just mentioned. I think that it won't have an effect long term on the economy nor counterterrorism as I just attempted to give my view on.But I think culturally there's a danger that we, all of us across Europe begin to retreat into our comfortable identities of old that we become accustomed. Whether it's England, Scotland, Ireland, and we've heard about France and Sweden and other potential exits across Europe.The danger there of course is that is has not only an effect on the United Kingdom, with now Nicola Sturgeon the head of the Scottish Nationalist Party that has the majority in Scotland declaring they will now call for a new referendum for Scotland to break away from the U.K. to rejoin the E.U.Now we've also Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland, saying that they will call for referendum to unite the Republic of Ireland and break away from the U.K. to join the E.U. And the worry here I have is that when we begin to retreat to retreat into these comfortable old nationalist identities, the far right gains from that, the far left will gain reciprocally from that as well.And, of course, those who paddle the exclusive Muslim identity, and you mentioned ISIS, but not just ISIS. Generally, Islamic extremist across the board, they will also gain from that as we all begin identifying primarily whether by religion or race. And that can't be good for Europe and nor for the unity of the West against some existential threats that we face in these current times.KELLY:  It's such an interesting experiment, if you will, and the world is about to find out how it's going to work out. Maajid, great to see you. Thank you, sir.NAWAZ:  Thank you. My pleasure.KELLY:  Also with us tonight, General Jack Keane, chairman of the institute for the study of war. Great to see you, General.JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  Good to see you.KELLY:  So, what do you make of these ISIS threat that they're going -- that they are going to unleash more attacks? Is that just bluster?KEANE:  Well, they exploit any situation that comes on the horizon certainly. They still have the capacity to motivate people and kill all fellow citizens in Europe and they have the capacity to direct attacks in Europe, and they've expanded into 10 affiliates now and they still have a lot of cash.So, yes, they're a threat and they're a danger. And they'll take advantage of anything that comes along. I think most of the -- most of this is propaganda but the threat is truly real.KELLY:  Who benefits, you know, in terms of security, national security? Who benefits from this move?KEANE:  Well, first of all, I agree with the Brits taking control of their own destiny, but believe me, the Kremlin is celebrating tonight. The vodka is flowing. And why is that? This is -- if this is what it looks like...(CROSSTALK)-KELLY:  Because it's a day that ends in ""y"".KEANE:  Yes, this is -- it looks -- it looks like this could be the beginning of the end of the European Union, and back in '91, we saw a similar collapse of the Soviet Union, which many Russians, and particularly its current leader believes it's the most tragic event of the 21th century.Shortly after the Soviet Union collapse then there are military alliance, the Warsaw Pact fell apart. What Putin has his eye on and always has his eye on, is the military alliance in Europe, NATO.He wants to challenge it. He wants to force its collapse, and because he wants to dominate and control the strategic countries in Eastern Europe as a historic buffer to protect mother Russia. This has always been his game. He's seeking -- he's seeking that kind of influence. He wants to be a world power, and he's dead serious about it, Megyn.KELLY:  And NATO stands in his way. So, does this affect NATO? I mean, realistically, does it?KEANE:  It doesn't affect NATO directly in terms of weakening its security. I mean, the Brits, clearly they're the second most powerful country in NATO. I don't believe this will in the near term affect the budgets that will support the British military. It possibly could.But the real issue in NATO, Megyn, is we decapitated it in terms of military capabilities after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But the social democracies that have exited for 40 plus years now are an incredible burden as governments in these countries and their leaders are feckless in terms of their inability to ask their people to sacrifice, not only to protect themselves but to protect the outer security of Europe and have step up the global responsibilities.That is the weakness of NATO. It's the political will is lacking in NATO. And Putin understands that. And believe me, for the last seven years, Megyn, there's been a lack of political will in the United States, in NATO, which is the strongest country in NATO and Putin has taken advantage of all of it.KELLY:  Fascinating. General, great to see you. Thank you, sir.KEANE:  Yes. Good seeing you, Megyn.KELLY:  Well, global markets lost trillions, trillions in value today. Trillions with a ""t."" Up next, we'll take a look at the economic fallout for those of you not in the market.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Breaking tonight, the Dow Jones Industrial average took a nose dive at the opening bell. Finishing down more than 600 points on the day, but the Brexit vote could have even bigger repercussions on your bottom line.Joining me now, Stephen Moore, a Fox News contributor and former Wall Street Journal columnist. Steven, good to see you. So, down 600 is not good. What does it mean for the average American?STEPHEN MOORE, HERITAGE FOUNDATION CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Well, you know, Megyn, I've been doing this for a long time following financial markets in the economy. And I can't remember a 24 hours like we've seen in the last day. And you're right, you know, this was a big, big selloff, so this wasn't expected that Brexit was going to pass.And once it did, investors just sold, sold, sold. So, a lot of people are very nervous about their retirement accounts and the IRA accounts and I would simply say this, now is not a good time to sell. You never want to sell into a down market. You want to sell when the market is high.I think the longer tell term implications of what happened in terms of how this is going to affect the economy, Megyn, I'd say this. The economy in the U.S. is already pretty fragile. We've got pretty bad jobs numbers in the last month. The GDP number for economic growth was really lousy that we had for the first quarter, so this couldn't come at a worse time.KELLY:  You know, I was looking how much better the dollar is doing against the pound and I was thinking, hey, that's good.MOORE:  Yes.KELLY:  But then all the reports said, no, that sucks, too. Explain why that's bad.MOORE:  No. This happens -- any time there's a crisis around the world, you know, whether it's come kind of a huge weather event or some kind of military event, people always flock to the dollar, Megyn. You know, they -- we're still the one source of safety around the world, so it's not surprising, to me, that people are buying dollars.By the way, the other thing people bought was gold, and so the gold price went way up yesterday. That's where, you know, that's also a refuge for people.But I am worried about the economy. I think that we just haven't had the kind of growth we wanted now for the last couple of years, and this just puts more stress on the economy right now.KELLY:  Yes.MOORE:  But again, I would tell people, you know, maybe take a deep breath, don't panic here and don't feel like, you know, your nest egg is in danger. Because I don't think it is. This is not long lasting.KELLY:  Hold on. Don't sell, buy.MOORE:  Yes.KELLY:  And it is good time for a hotel stay in London. Stephen, great to see you.MOORE:  You know it.KELLY:  We'll be right back(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  So, which of these do you like the best?

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight after nearly a year of campaigning and debating, attacks and rebuts, rising and falling political fortunes. We are now exactly seven days away from the first votes cast in the race to select the next president of the United States.  Exciting. But first, the Republican candidates face one final test. That could change everything. The last debate before voting begins is this Thursday night. The Fox News Google debate in Iowa.Good evening, everyone, and welcome to ""The Kelly File."" I'm Megyn Kelly.  We have brand new Fox polls and analysis out of Iowa. In the top three, businessman Donald Trump surging back to the lead of the pack. Overtaking Senator Ted Cruz who fell back to second. Then in third, Senator Marco Rubio. This weekend, Mr. Trump spoke about the strength and loyalty of his supporters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The people, my people are so smart. And you know what else they say about my people, the polls. They say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that? Where I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK? It's, like, incredible.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Also on Saturday, Senator Cruz received his most anticipated endorsement yet from one of the most influential conservative voices in the country, Glenn Beck.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GLENN BECK, FOUNDER, THEBLAZE: For the first time in 40 years of broadcast, I have found a man that I know I can look into his eyes and his word is his bond. That's why today I have officially endorsed Ted Cruz.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Why I've officially endorsed Ted Cruz to become the first Hispanic-American president.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In moments, we'll be joined by Mr. Beck who also had some choice words for Trump this weekend and then a Trump supporter will be here to respond.But first, a breakdown of the state of the race.Chris Stirewalt is our Fox News digital politics editor, he is in Iowa where we're holding our debate on Thursday. And Howie Kurtz is host of ""MediaBuzz."" Good to see you both. How is the site looking Chris, is it ready for us?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: And it is Easter and I'm the bunny. I am so excited, I cannot even tell you, this feels really good.KELLY: Me too.STIREWALT: I'm glad we're here.  KELLY: Me too. See you on Wednesday but the debate is Thursday night.  Just don't be confuse. All right. Let's talk about what happened.  Because it's an extraordinary swing from what we saw just a month ago, put the numbers on the board. Donald Trump now at 34 percent, 11 points over Ted Cruz. And look where it was just, what, less than, you know, couple of weeks ago where Ted Cruz had a four-point margin over, well, yes, four- point margin over Donald Trump and now completely flipped plus Trump has gained and he's up 11 points now. Chris, how does it happen?STIREWALT: Well, look, obviously the Trump attacks were part of it, but I think another part of it is this. This is what Iowa does. This is Iowa's jam.KELLY: It's a fickle bunch?STIREWALT: This is how -- well, like this, last time four years ago, Ron Paul was the guy, he had Iowa, everybody wrote the story about the coming libertarian revolution and blah, blah, blah, blah, and he said, Rick Santorum who from Pennsylvania? He shot up to the top. Iowa breaks late, Iowa decides late and Iowa doesn't like to be told what to do. And these folks are chewing on this real good.  KELLY: Howie, when you look at the internals of this poll, Donald Trump shored up his numbers with white evangelicals and with those describing themselves as very conservative. And that helps explain some of the gains he made versus just a couple of weeks ago. How is it the attack, you know, saying Cruz took money from banks, is it the Sarah Palin endorsement? What do you think it is?HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": I think it's the fact that he stayed in the Holiday Inn express in Iowa.  KELLY: That's was just last night.KURTZ: How badly he wants to win.KELLY: It couldn't possibly be.KURTZ: And he went to church. Right. Look, the attacks have been relentless. He had Cruz on the defensive talking about being born in Canada. He had him -- he's out now calling him a nasty guy and all of that. Sure, people are making up their minds late as they always do in the Iowa caucuses. Trump's so confident -- I interviewed him the other day, he said, you know, African-Americans are going to like me more than they like Barack Obama. That's the guy who's really feeling it. But there's one cloud over these Trump numbers and that is, you look at the internals, nearly half of those who are Trump supporters in the state of Iowa right now would be first-time caucus goers. And who knows how many of them will actually show up --  KELLY: Uh-hm. Show up and stay there. Chris, all along we've been looking at two presumed leans toward this nomination, the establishment lean and then the so-called, you know, insurgent or outsider lean and Cruz and Trump have been battling in that second lane. But as he seems to be inching closer to winning a couple of these states, Trump sounds like he doesn't have quite the messaging down when it comes to who he is. In which lane he really wants to participate in. Listen here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think they're -- I want to be honest, I have received so many phone calls from people that you would call establishment, from people generally speaking conservatives, Republicans, that want to come to our team.The establishments, the media, the special interest, the lobbyists, the donors. They're all against me. I'm self-funding my campaign. I don't owe anybody anything. I only owe it to the American people to do a great job. They are really trying to stop me. Everybody knows it. Everybody sees it. We're going to win.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: So that comes out after, you know, he's up there saying, you got to go establishment -- they're calling me, just last Friday he said something, you got to go a little establishment. Your thoughts?STIREWALT: I think Trump is now thinking in terms of running the table, winning every race, acclimation nomination, and if he can take his supporters, now, we talk about first-time caucus goers. You know, when we look at past caucuses, we're talking eight or nine out of ten caucus goers have caucused before, not a lot of new blood comes in. Trump's got a big bet. He can bring a lot of Democrats into the process. A lot of Independents into the process. Create these new voters. Then if he could partner up with establishment figures who prefer him over Cruz, who would just be a told wrecking ball for them and they know it, if he could create this synergy, then he would have sort of the conservative wing of the party that we've thought of as the Republican base for a long time. He'd have them in a vice grip between these new voters, Independents, Democrats, and some Republicans, plus an establishment group and that would be pretty tough to beat.  KELLY: What do we know, Howie, about Trump's ability to get folks out to the caucuses which can be a lengthy process? I mean, not necessarily getting there, but caucusing.  KURTZ: Well, he's got an organization in Iowa. And I don't think it's as strong as Cruz's organization and perhaps some of the others. The other hand, clearly the people who really like Donald Trump are very motivated.  That's how he's drawing thousands and thousands of people to these rallies.  But you hit on a real important wrinkle there, Megyn, which is Trump now does seem to be not denying that he'd like to be the establishment candidate. I asked him about that. I said, Cruz says you're the establishment candidate and he didn't deflect it. He mentioned Bob Dole, ultimate figure of the old Republican establishment who'd been very critical --KELLY: Bob Dole loves the establishment.  KURTZ: Yes, yes, yes.  KELLY: Thanks.  (LAUGHTER)KURTZ: So, you know, Trump who's run against the establishment this whole year and now he's got Sarah Palin to vouch for him with the conservatives.  He's I think broadening a little bit perhaps looking beyond Iowa and wanting to not just be in that anti-establishment --KELLY: All right. Before we go, Stirewalt, what do you make of it? If you had to say now, if you had to predict who's going to win Iowa, come on!  If you had to, what would you say?STIREWALT: This debate is going to be a big, bang, boom.  KELLY: Oh, the debate! I forgot there's a debate first.  STIREWALT: This whole sucker is going to rerack on Thursday evening because the stakes are high and the losers, as some people would say, in this race, know that they're facing the double elimination round and people are going to act crazy, unpredictable things are going to happen. It's going to get weird in there. And this race will look totally different, I promise, on Friday, than it does today.KELLY: Can't wait. We are all very psyched for Thursday night. We are ready. And looking forward to it. Guys, great to see you.  KURTZ: Same here.  STIREWALT: You bet.  KELLY: See you both in Des Moines.  Up next in a ""Kelly File"" exclusive, the story behind a key presidential endorsement from one of the most well-known conservatives in the United States.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BECK: The time for silliness and reality show tactics is past. It's been fun.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Glenn Beck is here on his first ever pick for president and the backlash he's already seen as a result.  Plus, Karl Rove on the race for Iowa and why he says it's likely to be a wild ride in the final stretch.  Plus, new reaction tonight to a Texas grand jury's decision to bring criminal charges against the filmmaker behind the undercover videos at Planned Parenthood. No charges against Planned Parenthood. Judge Andrew Napolitano is here on the late breaking news.(INAUDIBLE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BECK: I can't believe I actually have to say this, but for the first time in a long time, the press was right. I am here to announce that I am officially endorsing Ted Cruz to become the first Hispanic president of the United States.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Breaking tonight, Ted Cruz getting a historic endorsement from one of the most iconic conservative voices in the country, Glenn Beck taking to the campaign trail in Iowa Saturday throwing his support behind a presidential candidate for the first time in nearly 40 years of broadcasting. And with most experts suggesting the GOP race may be down to just two candidates, in particular, in Iowa, Mr. Beck's endorsement of one of those men came with a lengthy and repeated warning about the other.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BECK: Mr. Trump is saying over and over again on the road, I will make America great again. I will make America great. That's not true. It's not even possible. Each of us, as individuals, living our own dreams, making our own way, charting our own course, that is what makes America great.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Anything else, anything else is faith in self and it is empty, it's the human ego, and it is arrogant, and it is dangerous.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Glenn Beck is the founder of TheBlaze and a number one New York Times bestselling author of ""The Immortal Nicholas.""Glenn, it's great to see you. So why now after 40 years did you feel compelled to come out and endorse a candidate?BECK: Couple of reasons, Megyn, I've never endorsed anybody for any office at all mainly because half my career nobody cared. The second half, I never wanted to put my name on somebody. My credibility, I've worked hard for, and I don't -- I'm not going to put my name on some guy and have him go to Washington and not be that guy. Ted Cruz I have watched and I told him, you know, 40 years ago when he went into the Senate, I said, you know, I don't know if I trust you, you say all the good things, but if you go to Washington I'm going to be your worst nightmare if you start to be a weasel.And I've watched him closely and he has not. He has done the tough thing.  He has been, you know, David against Goliath in his own party, against other party, in the media. Nobody will stand with this guy, and yet he's never backed down from the fight. He says, I believe it, this is what I said I would do, I'm going to do these things.  KELLY: But you know his detractors including Donald Trump see that as not necessarily a positive. Trump calls him a nasty guy who can't get along with anyone.BECK: That's right.KELLY: Called him a whack job. Said he tells lies and he is using his, you know, inability to get along with people in Washington as a negative in terms of getting things done.  BECK: Here's the part. Donald Trump said this weekend that he is going to -- look, he has to cut deals and we have to be part of the establishment.  I'm quoting him. I'm going to have to be part of the establishment to be able to get things done. Well, that's the problem. That's what stopped me with Rand Paul. I love Rand Paul, but when he made a deal with Mitch McConnell, I didn't know if I could trust him. People are tired of deal making. Especially when it's not rooted in something. So, the second reason I decided to endorse Ted Cruz is ""A,"" I believe him, but the second thing is, I really truly believe, and I have a very long record and people made fun of me when I said the caliphate was coming.They said it was absurd and it would never happen. And Megyn, I tell you, I feel strongly about this, that there are a lot of great people in the Republican Party that you could vote for, a lot of them, and that I could vote for. Donald Trump is not one of them, and the next guy who comes into office is going to finish the fundamental transformation that was started by Woodrow Wilson and accelerated through Barack Obama. We're going to -- we're headed for real trouble. Islamic trouble, economic trouble, and civil unrest in the next four, five years.This next president is going to either finish and we're going to become a nation where the pen and the phone are the way to rule, or we're going to have somebody who has the constitution in their bones and they're going to repoint this cornerstone and set it right and give us a new start.  KELLY: But why, why do you, you know, obviously Donald Trump is the frontrunner by a lot.BECK: I know.  KELLY: And so conservatives are backing him to some extent. Moderates are backing him to some extent. And the country, the GOP, does not feel the way you do. How did you get to this sort of divide where you're over here and most these Republicans are over here?BECK: Because I've always been that guy. I mean, you know, Megyn, when I was working there, I was always kind of the guy who's out.  KELLY: But we loved you.BECK: I know. And I've always loved you. But I've always been the guy who is kind of going and marching to my own tune. And I'm, you know, the one thing I do know are progressives. If there's anything I know, it's a progressive, and this is a very dangerous thing, and I warned -- when I was on FOX, I did several episodes on the fact -- this is why I've only spoken at CPAC one time and they ever invited me back because I said, the progressive cancer started from the Republicans and it is in your own party.And I tried to warn on Fox, I did a show -- the biggest one you could remember is the one where I did with the pendulum and I said, here's Barack Obama, he's pulled it back so far, it's going to swing the other way and unless you root yourself in the Constitution, when that swings back, you're going to have another guy with a pen and with a phone and he's going to do bad things.  KELLY: Why would you believe that about Trump? I mean, what he says is, I am a dealmaker, he's an executive, I'm worth several billion dollars and I have a history of proving I can get things done, that I win, as he puts it.  BECK: That's not -- that's great for a CEO, but that's not the job of a president. The president -- first of all, does not create jobs. He doesn't jam things down your throat. The president is not supposed to rule by dictate or edict or executive power. He is supposed to make sure that the government acts and behaves the way it's supposed to. When he raises his hand, I will protect and defend the constitution of the United States.  When we head into trouble, and trouble is coming, you want a guy who says, look -- I mean, let me say this.We have Lindsey Graham on record saying, I don't have a problem with the NSA spying because, you know what, we're at war. We have, I think it was John McCain who said, you know, I love freedom of speech, but, you know, there's times that that has to be curbed. You have Barbara Mikulski talking about the Second Amendment and she said just last week, don't talk to me about this constitution, let's get this done.KELLY: It is irritating at times, isn't it?BECK: You got to root it in the Constitution.  KELLY: All right. Wait. I want to stop you there. Because we have much more to discuss with Glenn as you can hear, including the attacks that have come down against him since this announcement became public and his thoughts on another endorsement that occurred last week, that of Sarah Palin for Donald Trump. Stay tuned.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Glenn Beck, be on my show, be on my show. Every time I see him, he's a weird guy. He's always crying. He's always -- he's a weird dude.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, Glenn Beck's endorsement of Ted Cruz and his pointed attacks on Donald Trump have been reverberating for days already. But Mr. Trump has had plenty to say about Senator Cruz and his latest endorsement.  Responding on the very same day that Glenn Beck hit the campaign trail.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Glenn Beck, he'd call me, will you be on my show? It wasn't that I didn't want to do his show. I'm so busy. I wasn't able to do it. I wouldn't do his show. So, he got very hostile. Once he got very hostile, I didn't want to deal with it. His show is failing. He's failing. He's always crying. You know, I like cryers a little bit, but not that much. I think crying is fine. But I mean, I see this guy, he's a sad sap and he cries.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Back with us now, Glenn Beck.BECK: Well, the crying part is true, but I called him after months of saying that he was a horrible candidate, and I didn't -- our producer called him once at the end of August. And then at the first week I think of September, he said that if I wanted him on, I would have to personally call him and they wouldn't make an appointment for me. I just had to try to catch him. And I said, I'm not playing that game. So, we only offered him one time, we called him twice, only offered him a chance to come on because I thought it was a little unfair to say these things and all I wanted to ask was, what's your pivot point?KELLY: Uh-hm.BECK: You say you were diehard for abortion including partial-birth abortion, and now you're not. I can understand that. I can understand people -- I believe in redemption and changing your mind. I've changed my mind on things. Tell me what your pivot point was.  KELLY: He has a story about that, about someone he knew who had the baby and changed his views on abortion. She grew up to be a terrific kid.  BECK: Yes. A little bit. It doesn't --KELLY: But you're looking for -- I mean, obviously he's changed his position on --BECK: On almost everything.  KELLY: Many issues.  BECK: Almost everything.  KELLY: So, you're saying to believe it, you would need to see some sort of life transformation. Some sort of --  BECK: What happened, I mean, look, everybody understands, you know, this is why missionaries don't like to go to rich neighborhoods because rich people aren't listening. You know, I don't want to, hey, come on in, and tell me how to change my life and start going to church and living a different lifestyle? My life is sweet. Why would I change it? When people are distressed and in trouble, that's when they have true transformations. So, if a guy has lived a progressive lifestyle, his whole life, he doesn't like guns, he's for abortion, he's for universal health care. Last year he was saying that we should have universal health care and the government should pay for everything.  KELLY: You know that people know all this and they don't mind.BECK: I don't. I don't.KELLY: And it's what's been surprising to so many has been Sarah Palin's endorsement because she and you used to sound very much the same on these issues. You know, sort of Tea Party-esque, small government, out of your business, completely pro-life. Would never endorse somebody who, you know, was wobbly on that or the Second Amendment or any of these issues. And yet she came out full throttle for him last week. Full throttle. May have been helping. Because now he's up 11 points in Iowa according to the latest Fox News poll over Ted Cruz.BECK: I can't speak for Sarah Palin. I mean, I like Sarah Palin. I disagree with her strongly. I don't know what happened to her. You know, I don't know. I really don't know. I know I haven't changed my position.  And it's not personal. It is based on the Constitution and I'm so -- I'm so vocal about this because I feel the same way I did about the caliphate.  Nobody listened to me on the caliphate. The time to worry about the caliphate was when I was talking about it. Now the caliphate is a reality.  The time to deal with a progressive in the Republican Party is right now.  KELLY: So, what do you envision? I mean, if Donald Trump wins this nomination and, in fact, could win the presidency, what do you envision?BECK: Can I ask you a question? Let me ask you a question. Megyn, have you ever heard anyone talk about his supporters or talk about, to say, I can go on 5th Avenue and shoot people and my supporters are not going to -- they're not going to move.KELLY: That was a new one.BECK: Does that bother you as a journalist?KELLY: That was a new one.  BECK: Okay. When he said a month ago, you know, who is it that Putin has shot? They say that he's shot all these journalists. You know, and I'd never shoot journalists. Even though I hate him --KELLY: What he said to Jeff Scarborough was our country's killed a lot of people, too.  BECK: No, no, no, but he actually said from the stage, I'll never kill a journalist. Well, no, I'd never kill a journalist. Now, he says he was joking and I think he was joking, but do you really think that that's appropriate to joke? I mean, I think this guy is such a narcissist that it spells trouble when you give him this much power. But again, saying these things -- I have nothing to gain and everything to lose, this guy black balls and plays hard ball. I get it. I'm a big boy. I can take all the punches and look at me. I mean, there's lots of things to make fun of.  KELLY: Ah. I think the crying is kind of sweet. I liked it in John Boehner. I admire it in you. I'm the same.  BECK: But the thing is, this isn't about me, it isn't about Donald Trump.  It's about our country and the constitution. I will protect and defend the constitution of the United States. That's what I've always been for, and this, I believe, is our last opportunity to set things right. When trouble comes, just like in World War 2, would you round up Japanese people? I know I wouldn't. But when people are afraid, when they're hungry or we're at war, they'll violate all kinds of principles.KELLY: Yes.BECK: Let's not start with a guy who doesn't know the principles.  KELLY: Glenn, always great to see you.  BECK: Good to talk to you.  KELLY: Glenn Beck, everybody.  BECK: Thank you.  KELLY: So, what do Trump supporters think about all this? Well-known attorney and big Trump fan, David Wall, is here next to react.  Plus, with Iowa's track record for dramatic surprises, what should we expect one week from today? Karl Rove is here with his magic whiteboard.  Next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BECK: This isn't about me, it isn't about Donald Trump. It's about our country and the Constitution. I will protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. That's what I've always been for. And this, I believe, is our last opportunity to set things right.When trouble comes, just like in World War II, would you round up Japanese people? I know I wouldn't. But when people are afraid, when they're hungry, or we're at war, they'll violate all kinds of principles. Let's not start with a guy who doesn't know the principles.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was Glenn Beck moments ago on the reasons that he is against Donald Trump becoming the next President of the United States. Much less the GOP nominee.Here to respond, attorney and Trump supporter, David Wohl. So, you are 100 percent pro-Trump, David. Good to see you.DAVID WOHL, DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER: Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY: Let me ask you this, before this whole dustup with the endorsements, did you like Glenn Beck?WOHL: You know, I did. There was a point in time where I did like Glenn Beck. And he's right about the whole caliphate thing. He predicted that before anyone else did. So, he was dead on with that but...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: So, let me start with that.WOHL: OK.KELLY: What if anything this endorsement that he's given Cruz and the criticism he gives Trump do for you?WOHL: It's neither here nor there, Megyn. I mean, honestly, I think if anything it's going to bolster Trump's support even more.KELLY: Like everything.WOHL: I don't know that he really -- pardon?KELLY: Like everything does.WOHL: Well, everything. He's the Teflon Donald, Megyn. I mean, everything you do to attack him, whether directly or indirectly just increases his support.KELLY: Why? Why is that?WOHL: And that don't losses anything that can be done about that. I think that, you know, Trump's platform is one thing. And I think Beck ignores it to a large extent. I mean, he's pro-Second Amendment; he wants to defund Planned Parenthood. He wants to keep the mortgage interest rate deduction.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: His point wasn't that he did...WOHL: He wants to stop immigration from terror state.KELLY: His point -- but let me just respond.WOHL: Go ahead.KELLY: His point wasn't that those aren't Trump's current positions. His point was not long ago, he had the opposite positions. And I didn't see the pivot point, he said.WOHL: Yes.KELLY: What in his life would explain such major shifts on so many issues?WOHL: Well, Ted Cruz was for amnesty before he was against it. Ronald Reagan was a democrat before he was a republican. Barack Obama was against gay marriage before he was for it. It's part of the political evolution and Trump is going through that now.And when he says what he says, and he tells people this is my position on things, people believe him. He's a sledgehammer that transcends politics, Megyn. And that's what's so amazing about him that I've never seen in a political candidate ever. I've been voting for 36 years.KELLY: You don't have to tell us. It's a...(CROSSTALK)WOHL: So, well, I'm just before it, so.KELLY: Now just for the record, Ted Cruz has never supported citizenship. There's a debate about whether he supported legalization. But let me ask you this, because Trump as we mentioned in the other segment, has, he's getting a little close to the line on whether he really is establishment. How does he really feel about the establishment? This is what I'm referring to. I'm curious to your reaction. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You know what, there's a point at which let's get to be a little establishment; we got to get things done, folks, OK? Believe me, don't worry. We're going to make such great deals.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: What do you make of that?WOHL: I think he negotiates absolutely. But you know what, in Donald Trump's history, if you look at his negotiation, he comes out on top. And that's the critical issue. The republicans have owned the House and Senate for years now and all they've done is got down on their knees and say, whatever you want, Mr. Obama. And that is what's fueling this pro-Trump fire, Megyn.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: And how big of a factor is it...WOHL: People are so sick and tired of that.KELLY: And how big of a factor is it that Trump does not care about being PC?WOHL: That's huge. I mean, let's face it. Political correctness, the idea that Barack Obama has pretty much downplayed the First Amendment and its importance, there's nothing bigger at this point, Megyn.He goes in, says what he says and he's like, what, you don't like it, too bad, get out of my -- get out of my lecture, get out of my hall, I don't care. And people love that right now. It's been something that I think this tyranny of political correctness has really gotten into people's minds and really want -- people want to get rid of that. So, he's part of that solution.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: So, it feels like a way -- it feels like a way to send a message to you, it feels like a way to send a message that sort of smothering you feel you've had.WOHL: It's huge. It's huge, Megyn, and that's it. You can't say this, you can't say that. All these groups, these militant groups that have arisen and said, you know what, if you say that, we'll get you fired.I talked to a deputy today in court in Los Angeles where I was. And he said, you know what, I can't say anything in court. If I say something, and I'm overheard by an attorney or by a social worker, they'll let my superior know and I'll be fired for it and I'm talking about relatively innocuous stuff. And he's like...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well, the security guards are not supposed to be doing the talking. The lawyers like you are supposed to be doing the -- in the court's defense. David Wohl is being handsome to go in there and do the talking. No, I understood. Point taken.WOHL: Right.KELLY: I got to run. Great to see you.WOHL: Thank you, Megyn. Great to see you.KELLY: Yes. Good to see you. Well, if history is any indication, America should not expect that next week's vote results will necessarily look like this week's poll results.Karl Rove is a Fox News contributor. He served as senior adviser to President George W. Bush as well as deputy Chief of Staff. Karl, good to see you.So, George W. Bush won Iowa in 2004. Right? It was one of the only two times in the past, like, 30 years, Iowa has ever accurately predicted the GOP nominee.KARL ROVE, FORMER GEORGE W. BUSH SENIOR ADVISER: Well, I would say it was 2000 that he won, and not 2004.KELLY: Right.ROVE: There were no caucuses in Iowa in 2004. But, yes, in fact, he's the only republican to win Iowa, win the nomination, and win the presidency.KELLY: So, why is Iowa not so great at predicting on the republican side, they're pretty good on the dem side, who the nominee will be?ROVE: Well, they're not that bad -- good on the dem side in picking winners in the general election. The only two times that that's happened is 1976, with Jimmy Carter and 2012 with Barack Obama.They do tend to pick the democratic nominee but tehy don't necessarily pick the winner in the general election.Look, on the republican side it's because the State Caucus, the caucus in Iowa tends to be nominated by social conservatives, particularly from Western Iowa, and as a result, they tend to favor candidates who are Evangelical social conservatives.Pat Robertson, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, all of them ran particularly well and took the Iowa caucuses as a result.KELLY: So, what does history show us? Are they late deciders in Iowa? Is there a huge faction that decides late?ROVE: Well, it looks like everybody decides late. If you take 2012 and the exit polls, 46 percent of the people said that they made up their minds either on the day of the election, itself, the day of the caucus, itself, basically one out of every five caucus goers decided that day...KELLY: Wow.ROVE: ... and nearly, and nearly one out of two, 46 percent made up their minds in the last three days. So, you're going to be at the debate Thursday night, auspicious as it is going to be that night, because sometime Friday, sometime Saturday early, Saturday morning, is apparently when nearly one out of every two voters, if it looks like last time and the time before that, one out of every two voters will make up their minds in that last weekend.KELLY: So, when you look at the polls, do you say I don't look at these polls, or do you say, no, you know, overall, you know, taking in the aggregate, they're a good predictor.ROVE: Well, we have to decide whether or not it is 2008 or 2012.KELLY: Hold the whiteboard.ROVE: Yes. Here's the whiteboard. I knew you were waiting for it.KELLY: Nice one.ROVE: Two thousand -- two thousand eight, Mike Huckabee won. And he on -- he led going on in the final days. Eight days out. He was leading and on election day got 5.4 percent more than he was in the real clear politics average as of the time that we are today.Mitt Romney got .8 of a percent less. John McCain jumped from fifth into third by getting 1.5 more. And Fred Thompson dropped 4.1 points and dropped from third into fourth.But pretty much not very much movement, 2012, big difference. Rick Santorum gained between eight days out and the election day, itself, the close of the caucuses, he gained 16.7 points compared -- nearly 17 points compared to his number in the real clear politics average.Mitt gained 3.5, stayed in second. Ron Paul fell out of first, dropped .7 of a percent and Newt Gingrich dropped a point. Excuse me, Newt dropped out of first place and Rand -- Ron Paul dropped into third from being second.So, you know, it depends on what kind of year it's going to be. My gut is it's probably somewhere in between, but if I were -- if I were having to bet, I'd say it looks more like 2008 than it does 2012.KELLY: I got to go, but I want to ask you quickly, Des Moines Register today, or yesterday, endorsed Rubio on the republican side, Hillary on the dem side. Does that matter?ROVE: Yes, it does. And I think it will help Rubio with the kind of voters that he's looking for and I think it will help Hillary better that she got it than Bernie Sanders got it. But it doesn't have a big effect. It just has a minimal effect. It will probably be enough to guarantee that Rubio is in third. And where he is in the polls today solidifies that position all likelihood.KELLY: Karl, great to see you.ROVE: You bet. Thank you.KELLY: Mark your calendars now. The next and final GOP debate before the Iowa caucus is this Thursday, January 28th, at 9 p.m. right here on the Fox News channel.Yours truly will be moderating the debate alongside Bret Baier and Chris Wallace. It is the republican candidate's last chance to make their appeal to voters before the February 1st caucus. Do not miss the Fox News Google GOP debate Thursday night at 9:00.Well, we also have new fallout over a grand jury's decision to bring criminal charges in the Planned Parenthood video case. Remember this? Where the guy went in, this group, they took these videos and they alleged that Planned Parenthood was trying to sell body parts of babies? Guess who's in trouble with the law. Not the abortion providers. Judge Naps is here.Plus, the latest round of polls sounding new alarms for the Clinton campaign in some circles. Ed Henry reports live from Iowa. Plus, Kirsten Powers has some news from Mrs. Clinton as more and more voters say they feel the burn.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, with just one week to go before Iowa, polls on the democratic side of the presidential race are tightening up.A brand new Fox News poll finds Hillary Clinton's national lead has narrowed to its slimmest margin yet; she's now just 12 points ahead of Bernie Sanders nationally.Last June, Mrs. Clinton held the commanding 46-point lead over Sanders. This all comes as the democrats square off tonight in a Town Hall.Ed Henry reports from Des Moines in Iowa. Ed?ED HENRY, FOX NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, no better example of that bigger momentum for Bernie Sanders than what's happening on the ground here in the Hawkeye State. Hillary Clinton used to have a double digit lead.As you can see from this new Fox Poll fresh out tonight, she's only leading by six points. So, margin of error about four points. This is almost a dead heat. Look at New Hampshire. The Clinton campaign has been discounting that a little bit because Bernie Sanders is from neighboring Vermont, but he has now opened up a massive 22-point lead.There's fear in the Clinton camp tonight that Bernie Sanders could win both of these early contests and really shake up this race. He's doing it by running an outsider campaign with a lot of passion, but Hillary Clinton has been falling back on her resume. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, D-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What the political revolution is about is having people stand up and say, enough is enough.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have the experience and understanding to be able to chart a course that will not only keep us safe at home, but keep our world more secure and more prosperous and peaceful.(END VIDEO CLIP)HENRY: You can hear the difference right there, the body language, the voice, Hillary Clinton very calm, cool, saying in a dangerous world as a former Secretary of State, I've got this, I've got the experience. But remember, she tried that in 2008, it did not work, Megyn.KELLY: Ed henry, thank you.Joining me now with more, Kirsten Powers, the USA Today columnist and a Fox News contributor. Kirsten, good to see you.So, the lead that she had in Iowa is down to six points from 14 points not long ago. If Bernie Sanders wins these two states, the conventional wisdom is he may enjoy that but he's not going to enjoy it for very long, because then she's going to go down in the south, she's going to sweep and sweep up as well. Your thoughts?KIRSTEN POWERS, USA TODAY COLUMNIST: Yes, I think most people. The conventional wisdom, I guess I would say, is that if you have to be one of these two candidates, you want to be Hillary Clinton because she's built for the long haul.And after you get outside of these two states that are predominantly white, look, you know, he is from a bordering state of New Hampshire so that makes sense. You can kind of give him that one. Iowa has, you know, is a predominantly white state. He comes from a predominantly white state. He's very liberal. They're very liberal. They have even a high number of socialist, for example. So, you can -- you can sort of write those off.KELLY: Iowa is a funny state.POWERS: It is a funny state.KELLY: The high number of socialists from the high number of extremely social conservatives, you know?POWERS: Yes. Yes. Now it's an interesting place. It's definitely an interesting place. And I think that once he gets down to South Carolina, for example, then we start to see the issue that he has with non-white voters, though, in the Fox News poll, one of the interesting numbers was that if you look at the national poll, she's starting to really bleed African-American voters. She is down 17 points from September.KELLY: Wow.POWERS: And so that -- that's significant.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But that may -- perhaps President Obama helped stop that bleeding today because he came out and had lovely things to say about her to Politico's Glenn Thrush...POWERS: Right.KELLY: ... saying her campaign, he admitted, is a little bit more pros, the poetry, but said she's really warm and funny, she's engaging. He was effusive in his praise saying she can start on day one and talks all about her experience.POWERS: Right.KELLY: Does that help her?POWERS: It was, you know, an almost endorsement. He's trying to stay out of the race without giving an endorsement, but he definitely made it very clear that she's his choice. And I think that that does help her to a certain extent, but she still has to be concerned and if nothing else, it's just a reminder of what happened in 2008, where in the beginning, she had the African-American voters with her.And as people started to see that President or now President Obama, candidate Obama at that time, was a viable person that could be elected, you start to see voters shifting. The good news for Hillary is that Bernie Sanders is not Barack Obama and he also probably doesn't have this...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Nor is he an outsider. It's kind of funny to hear -- how many years has he been in Congress?POWERA: Exactly.KELLY: I mean, the '60s?POWERS: Exactly. They're very different people. And also remember that President Obama had a phenomenal organization.KELLY: Yes.POWERS: And whatever organization Bernie Sanders has, well, we have to wait and see if he's able to really change the electorate which is something he is going to have to do because also in the polls showed in Iowa she does much better among people who have caucuses before. So, you know, that's...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Who shows up? Who turns out and exactly, who. Like what's the voting history. Kirsten, great to see you. We'll be watching you.POWERS: Right. Thank you.KELLY: One week from tonight.Remember the controversy over the hidden camera videos of Planned Parenthood officials appearing to negotiate price? What they were paying for remains in dispute. Their detractors say they were paying for organs harvested from fetuses being aborted.They say it was basically just a facility fee. Well, someone has now been criminally charged. Not Planned Parenthood. Judge Naps is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, a Texas grand jury bringing criminal charges recommending them against the filmmaker who shot a series of hidden camera videos targeting Planned Parenthood.David Daleiden -- I can never pronounce that -- the founder of the Center for Medical Progress was indicted on charges of tampering with a government record and purchase and sale of human organs. He was the undercover guy making the videos. Another colleague of his also charged, Planned Parenthood was not charged.Joining me now, Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, what does this mean?JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: This means that a political prosecutor has injected herself in a very serious issue about whether or not Planned Parenthood was profiting from the abortion of babies by selling body parts.Here's the backstory. The lieutenant governor, the new lieutenant Governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, is a very, very serious pro-life advocate. Was before he was lieutenant governor is now. He asked this prosecutor to investigate whether or not these tapes were real. Was Planned Parenthood really offering to sell body parts and did they, in fact, reference that they had sold body parts they sold?KELLY: Which they deny.NAPOLITANO: Which they deny. And anybody that watches these tapes can come to their own conclusion. I submit that if you watch them you will conclude that they did sell body parts and were willing to sell them in the future.So, the prosecutor investigates this and she decides to present a case to a grand jury. We haven't seen the grand jury transcript yet, but we will. Not charging Planned Parenthood with selling body parts but charging the journalists who were testing Planned Parenthood with participating in an actual conspiracy to sell body parts.KELLY: You mean they didn't want to buy any body parts at all.NAPOLITANO: No, of course not. These are what we call crimes of intent. You have to intend to commit this crime. You can't just utter the words.So, if a journalist says to Planned Parenthood, are you interested in selling body parts? That journalist now to worry about being indicted for suggesting this on.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: So, does this sound like a political hit job or what is this?NAPOLITANO: Absolutely this is a political hit job. You used to practice law. I used to be on the bench. We both know that a skilled prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict anything. The favorite phrases you can get a grand jury, you want that ham sandwich if you want.There's no judge there's anybody there on the other side. We won't know what this prosecutor told the grand jury unless and until there's an criminal trial.KELLY: This is fascinating. Looking forward to getting a look at this complaint. Judge, great to see you.NAPOLITANO: good to be with you.KELLY: We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: All right. So, tune in to Fox News tonight at 11 p.m. for a special live and late edition of ""The Kelly File."" We're going to have live analysis and reaction to this Democratic town hall with Chris Stirewalt and Howie Kurtz, plus, many more and wait until you hear the Stirewalt headline so far.
