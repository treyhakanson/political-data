This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The bottom line, in terms of the public, I want people to understand that the dangers of you contracting Ebola, the dangers of a serious outbreak, are extraordinarily low. But we are taking this very seriously at the highest levels of government.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: President Obama meeting with his cabinet late this afternoon after canceling a political trip to Connecticut and New Jersey. Take a look at the latest Fox News polls on this issue of Ebola. First, ""How prepared is the government to deal with this virus?"" And there you see ""somewhat,"" or ""not very"" and ""not"" 42 percent. And then the question that a lot of people up on Capitol Hill are asking, ""Should the U.S. ban flights from countries where Ebola virus has broken out?"" And there you see the majority of those polled say these flights should be banned. One of those wasn't polled, but he's weighed in. The speaker of the House, John Boehner, just a few moments ago issued a state ""A temporary ban on travel to the United States from countries afflicted with the virus is something that the president should absolutely consider along with any appropriate actions as doubts about the security of our air travel systems grow."" And obviously after a second health care workers has tested positive and she got on a flight.Let's bring in our panel, Ron Fournier, senior political columnist of National Journal, Nina Easton, columnist for Fortune magazine, and Tucker Carlson, host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend."" Ron, first of all, this worker gets on a flight after working with the Liberian man who died. It is a pretty stunning development.RON FOURNIER, SENIOR POLITICAL COLUMNIST, NATIONAL JOURNAL: It's chilling, I mean, absolutely astonishing that we let this happen. And it's just -- it goes to the basic competence of the people involved in the health care system and the government. And also, you know, rule number one to crisis management is you overwhelm a problem with attention and money and resources before it becomes a crisis. And once again we are behind the 8-ball here. I know now we'll put in protocols so this doesn't happen again, but the problem is we have already had people who are now exposed to Ebola or are worried they have been exposed to Ebola, and it should never have happened.BAIER: Yes. Nina?NINA EASTON, COLUMNIST, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: To his credit, the president today, he is being criticized on Ebola and being behind the 8-ball, that's just going to happen. But to his credit he was out there a couple of weeks ago saying we're going to take the battle, so to speak, to Africa and sending resources there because that's where you have to contain it. And he made that point again today. You've got to contain it there, and otherwise it becomes a global crisis. He was on the phone to world leaders saying you've got to chip in more to contain this crisis.And, secondly, on this point about -- you're right, chilling, that the virus is actually in the air flying through the United States, he's development this SWAT team system, saying to the CDC you have to, once there is a diagnosed Ebola patient, you have to spend in a SWAT team to make sure that all the protocols are carried through, because when they are it's been contained.BAIER: It was also at the CDC, and said in the highly unlikely chance that someone came into the U.S. with Ebola the CDC and health systems were prepared, and obviously it's clear that they weren't.TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: This is a classic problem of leadership, especially leadership in science. We tend to overstate what we know as fact. We actually don't know with any great precision how Ebola is transmitted. We're not exactly sure how at least one of these people got Ebola. We can say she didn't follow the protocols. Which protocols? Notice they're not very precise about that because we don't know exactly.So in light of that, in light of the seriousness of this problem, it's inexplicable that the president dismisses almost with a wave of his hand the notion that you would restrict air travel from the places afflicted. Anyone who has ever spent time in West Africa can tell you we're not going to get this epidemic under control overnight, maybe ever. It's too disorganized a place. And the idea that we just don't want to hurt people's feeling so therefore we're not going to restrict travel, it's not a perfect solution, therefore we shouldn't attempt it, that's crazy.EASTON: Can I make two points on that, though? The health care workers, the nurses who came down with Ebola were dealing with vomit and diarrhea, bodily fluids. This wasn't airborne transmission as you would have on an airplane. So I think the president today was trying to put this in perspective.CARLSON: Do we know that? I'm not sure that we know that.EASTON: We have had Ebola around for decades.BAIER: Let me run a sound bite from Senator Rand Paul today, which kind of deals with this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAND PAUL, R - KY: It was a mistake for the government to say, oh, don't worry, it's like AIDS. AIDS is difficult to catch. It's direct bodily fluid exchange. But if someone's sitting next to you with Ebola and they cough, you can catch it. Even the CDC ultimately miss this. They say direct contact means three feet. If three feet is direct contact, that's not really the meaning of the word that most Americans would understand.(END VIDEO CLIP)FOURNIER: Without being too clinical and too specific here, bodily fluids can be transmitted on an airplane in many different ways. I think Tucker is exactly right. We can't overstate the potential problems here. We should not understate them, and that's what the administration has done.I happen to have faith that I'm not going to get Ebola, my family is safe. I have relative faith in the institutions, but even I'm starting to have some doubts. And that's the problem. They just don't look competent enough where we can think, OK, they're going to take care of things for us, which is how we've got to be in this situation.BAIER: Let me ask you about this. The president cancels this fundraiser to Connecticut. He comes back to White House, holds this cabinet meeting.  Here's what Jennifer Palmieri, then White House communications director, said in July. ""It is rarely a good idea to return to the White House just for show, when the situation can be handled responsibly from the road. Abrupt changes to his schedule can have the unintended consequence of unduly alarming the American people and creating a false sense of crisis.""  Tucker, what about today, meeting with his cabinet?CARLSON: Well, I mean, look, let me just -- I think this relates to something that Ron just said. I have faith in the American medical system.  It's obviously the best in the world. I have faith in our government to a large extent. This is too political. Politics has crept in to the response to this disease. It's crept into the conversation over whether to restrict flights. Notice the debate in Congress right now, the idea that somehow it's a civil rights issue or something. This has nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with civil rights, nothing to do with hurting people's feelings, nothing to do with getting votes in November.  It has to do with maintaining an Ebola-free country. And I just worry that they think about politics at least second on the list of concerns, and that's just scary.FOURNIER: That quote you brought up is a perfect example. Jennifer said that it was ludicrous at the time. She said it so she could maybe get through to the next cycle, and now it's being thrown up in her face. Of course the president did the right thing today by staying here and not going to the fundraiser. He would get the money anyhow, and having his cabinet in. It was ludicrous back then to say we didn't want to cancel our events because we didn't want to create a crisis.(CROSSTALK)BAIER: The 60 fundraiser or 98 he's had since -- in his second term.EASTON: And he went after the downed Malaysian airliner. He's gone in the face of ISIS. He's been tone deaf about this.BAIER: Golfing after the beheading.FOURNIER: And again and again they say things to justify their actions or inactions to get them through one news cycle and they don't think about the long-term implications.(CROSSTALK)CARLSON: The president said I hugged and kissed these medical workers. I don't think those are the workers who treated patients in Dallas, by the way. These are workers who treated patients months ago.BAIER: In Emory.CARLSON: Right. So I think that's a misleading thing to say. Why pretend we know what we don't know? I don't understand that.EASTON: Well, there clearly was a serious probably breakdown in protocol in Dallas, a deadly breakdown. However, this whole question of air travel, part of what they're trying to go is take the fight to West Africa, with resources. And if you shut down air travel, you can't do that. The health care --(CROSSTALK)CARLSON: You could restrict it.FOURNIER: I'm open minded on this, but nobody's explained to me, and I listened to Dr. Fauci, nobody has explained to me why we can't still get health care over there.EASTON: You'd have to do it through charter flights.FOURNIER: Well, we have charter flights. Hopefully to military flights. There's a lot of ways to get aid in there without commercial flights.CARLSON: It's pressure from Congress. It's pressure for people who are treating this as a civil rights issue, that the number on sin in their view is to hurt the feelings of others. No foreign citizen has a right to come to the United States, period, and we should remind ourselves of that.BAIER: What else is on the president's plate? We can tell you it's full, and judging by the polls you're weighing as well. That's coming up next.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are you reluctant to give an answer on whether or not you voted for President Obama?ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES, D - KY SENATE CANDIDATE: Bill, there's no reluctance. This is a matter of principle. Our Constitution grants here in Kentucky the constitutional right for privacy at the ballot box.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So your reluctance is a matter of principle, standing on principle rather than answering the question?GRIMES: I'm not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in Kentucky.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: There is no sacred right to not announce how we vote. I voted for Mitt Romney, proudly. I voted for John McCain. And by the way, in 2012, 116 out of 120 Kentucky counties agreed with my judgment.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: A debate last night in Kentucky. A short time after that debate ended, the reporter down there, Sam Youngman who we know well with the Lexington Herald Leader tweeted, ""Grimes,"" Alison Lundergan Grimes, ""did tell University of Kentucky's Austin Ryan, I assume a radio show, she voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the '08 primary. This as we find out on this particular race that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is doing something interesting. ""The DSCC has now spent more than $2 million in Kentucky according to an official, on background and continues to make targeted investments in the ground game while monitoring the race for future investments, but is currently not on the air in the state and with no plans to get on the air in the state."" There you see the spread in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. That's where it will begin, a look at the midterms.Let's bring in our panel, and syndicated columnist George Will, Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. George?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: The impressive thing to me about Democrats across the country is how well they're doing as measured by running ahead of the president's job approval. Pryor in Arkansas, is losing narrowly to Tom Cotton, but running 16, 17 points ahead of Obama, which is really astonishing.And what we just read there about the Democrats strategy, they mentioned the get out the vote. That's the crucial thing this year. In North Carolina, the Democrats say they have identified half a million women voters and 375,000 African-American voters who voted for Obama in 2012 but skipped the 2010 off year elections. They think, and they're probably right, if they can get a large portion of those people to vote in this year's off year election they will probably win that state.BAIER: What about the DSCC?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think we're at the point in this midterm election where campaign committees have to make decisions. And it's kind of like triage. They seem to be deciding that an investment in Kentucky is just not worth it. They have got a lot of other vulnerable Democrats.  There are a lot of other races where their money might be better spent.  North Carolina might be one of them. Kay Hagan there has managed to hang on to an extremely tiny lead there. And I agree, they're focusing a lot of their effort on the ground game. I think Kentucky is just not at the top of their list of things they hope to pick up.BAIER: We should point out there's a new poll out tonight in New Hampshire that has Scott Brown up. It may be an outlier, but the Real Clear Politics average in New Hampshire now is down to 3.5 for Jeanne Shaheen. That's a big deal because it's not a race that Democrats thought they would have to really defend or spend to defend, Charles.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, if Brown wins in New Hampshire we know it's a wave election. It will be a landslide across the board. That's one of the big reaches. But in Kentucky, you remember, it was once said -- Lincoln is said to have said about the Civil War, I would like to have God on my side, but I must have Kentucky.If Republicans can't win Kentucky in this year with all the factors going in there their on popularity, the president, things abroad, things at home not looking good, and with a fairly weak candidate. Grimes' response is preposterous. The idea that because people can't be forced to disclose the vote in the ballot box there's a constitutional requirement that you not disclose it is simply ridiculous. And that she would double down I really do think is a sign of how much of a rookie she is. So I'm not surprised at the DNCC's pulling out. That is a race they are not going to win. But the fact that it's close indicates that Republicans are doing a lot worse this year, even though I think they're going to get a majority, than they should be doing.BAIER: I want to put up the Senate predictions, all these models. This is how it looks for the major modeling of whether the Republicans are going to pick up the Senate. The Washington Post is the most aggressive, 95 percent, New York Times, 72, FiveThirtyEight, this is Nate Silver's blog, 59.2.Now, take a look at Weekly Standard, Jay Cost, ""Will the GOP fumble at the goal line? The state of play. Midterms elections often break in October, often late in the month, as low-information voters begin to engage. While Republicans have the edge for the Senate there's not a definitive break, and it's safest to consider control of the Senate a tossup. And even if they won, Republicans would be foolish to take victory as a vindication. At most it would mean the public wants to check Barack Obama."" You buy that?WILL: I do. And I think Cost is right. And I think we're looking at the wrong number. If we're looking at the amount of money spent on broadcasting, to go back to the get out the vote effort, this isn't volunteers anymore. These are paid people, and they're sopping up a much larger portion of campaign spending than they used to. At this point in the campaign, they've saturated people with broadcast ads. So the utility of the last political dollar is pretty small. The return on get out the vote may be much larger and we may get a surprise this year.BAIER: I want to talk about a race that we haven't talked about really, and that's Virginia, because it was believed that Mark Warner was a safe Democratic hold in Virginia. They had a debate. Let's take a look at the RCP average of this race. It has Mark Warner up pretty significantly, 49.6 to 38.6 in the average of recent polls. But Gillespie has been closing up as of late. Last night, was a debate on -- one particular issue came up again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ED GILLESPIE, R - VIRGINIA SENATE CANDIDATE: This is very serious in terms of the federal bench has a big impact on our lives. And we need to make sure that qualified people are put on the bench. And I would never play politics with recommending judicial appointments.SEN. MARK WARNER, VIRGINIA: When I heard that Phillip was considering resigning from the Senate, I reached out to his son, Joseph, and -- to find out what was going on. During that conversation, we brainstormed about possible opportunities for his sister. I did not offer her a job nor would I offer her any kind of position.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: A lot of people say, what is this all about? It's about a state senator --LIASSON: It's about a state senator who flipped parties and resigned, which made the composition of the legislature flip, stymying Governor Terry McAuliffe, the Democrats, plans to expand Medicaid under ObamaCare in that state.BAIER: And there was a call to Senator Warner.LIASSON: There was a call with Senator Warner that maybe he was trying to prevent this guy from doing that, what can I do for your children? That's what this is about.I still think this is too big a gap for Ed Gillespie to close. I think he's done pretty well. He's setting himself up very nicely to be the governor in Virginia in the future. But this is a tough race. If there is a real wave, however, then all sorts of people get swept up with it, even people with a gap like that. But I don't know if we're there yet.KRAUTHAMMER: When you watch that sound bite, you see that Gillespie had a real opportunity that he appears to have missed. When Warner says, ""I called him about his resigning and then we brainstormed about the daughter's job opportunities,"" what are you doing brainstorming about employment for a daughter? This is about whether you're going to leave the Senate or not. And that was an opportunity for Gillespie to say this is an issue of possible corruption.Instead he said, oh, we want to make sure we have the best judges. This isn't about the quality of the judiciary, it's about the use of nepotism and favors to do stuff that you shouldn't do. This is in a state where remember the governor has just been found guilty of corruption. It wasn't an issue in which he could have nailed Warner, who is way ahead because he was a popular governor and a popular senator. But I think Mara's right. Unless there's a way, this seat will remain with Warner.BAIER: We'll continue with this discussion and some breaking news after a quick break.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC.
