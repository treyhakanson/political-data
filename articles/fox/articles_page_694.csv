"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" September 28, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Factor Follow Up Segment"" tonight, with all the Pope coverage and Republican politics all over the place, the Hillary Clinton e- mail story is tough to define at this point.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know, at the beginning of the year she was the most admired person in public life and she earned it. Why? Because she was being covered by people who reported on what she was doing.What happened? The Presidential campaign happened. And the nature of the coverage shifted from issue-based to political.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: The former president saying his wife is getting hammered unfairly because of politics.With us now Amie Parnes, senior White House correspondent ""The Hill"" newspaper.Now, I don't really understand what the heck is going on. And I'm getting paid to understand it.AMIE PARNES, ""THE HILL"": Right.O'REILLY: I have got to be honest with everybody. Every day it's she forgot this, she didn't do that -- you know. Is there anything that has happened in the last week that the folks should know about that's damning?PARNES: I think the fact is that the story is alive and well. It's not going away. And that's scary, too. The Clinton camp, you know, they want the story to go away. They want to pivot to other issues, to policy issues but they can't because on Friday, for instance, we discovered that two months of e-mails are suddenly missing. And you know it's confusing it to me as it is to you.O'REILLY: Is it really you?PARNES: It is.O'REILLY: Because you wrote a book on her. So I understand that the FBI found e-mails between Secretary of Clinton and General Petraeus who at the time was running the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Is that right?PARNES: Yes. And she actually -- I reveal in our book, actually I co-authored it with someone. We revealed that she had invited General Petraeus over for wine. She was trying to court him at the time and I think that was part it. You know, we don't know exactly what were --O'REILLY: So that would be a private e-mail that she destroyed or didn't hand over. If she was inviting him over for wine --PARNES: Well, I think it's work. It's considered work.O'REILLY: So do I. But this is the problem with this story. I agree with you 100 percent -- e-mail Hillary together again never going to break up.PARNES: Right.O'REILLY: All right. Republicans are going to keep it going. But, fair-minded people want to know, did she do anything wrong? Did she lie directly to the American people?PARNES: And that's the problem because --O'REILLY: Do you believe she did?PARNES: You know -- people even strategists, Democratic strategists, donors I talk to all the time say this is a problem for us. I talk to people last week. I did a story where I interviewed bundlers. They are concerned about this. They think we don't know when the other shoe is going to drop.O'REILLY: All right. So they're thinking the FBI may find e-mails that are embarrassing to Hillary Clinton that she tried to delete. That's the bottom line, right?PARNES: And classified e-mails.O'REILLY: Ok. But that's not as big. You know, classified is big. But not as big as you screwed up on Benghazi, bang, I'm erasing it.PARNES: Well, that, too.O'REILLY: Right. Now, the FBI, as I predicted accurately, can reconstitute pretty much everything she erased. Is that what you are hearing?PARNES: Yes. They found everything. And so I think that's why we have this drip, drip, drip as she called it this weekend and as everyone is calling it because more and more e-mails keep surfacing and it's going to keep the story alive.The thing that's also going to keep it alive is that she is testifying on Capitol Hill on October 22nd.O'REILLY: Yes.PARNES: So the story isn't --O'REILLY: You know what she's going to say. Look, the Clintons believe and they believe this and they took a lie detector test that they passed. This is all political witch-hunt. She didn't do anything wrong. She was overwhelmed. Da-da-da-da-da, how can I remember. Don't you agree?PARNES: But you know what's bad for them is that this trust narrative. It's not about the e-mails. It's about the past and how all this baggage keeps coming up again and again and again and people don't believe. I talked to donors who don't believe.O'REILLY: So you are getting the feeling from big Democratic donors they want Biden to come in?PARNES: They want some opening. They just don't know what is going to happen with the Clinton camp.O'REILLY: But there is only one option -- Biden.PARNES: Right.O'REILLY: Bernie Sanders is never going to get elected president of the United States.PARNES: Right.O'REILLY: They have to know that.PARNES: Right.O'REILLY: All right. Bernie is having a lot of laughs out there on the trail and people are paying attention to him for the first time in his life.PARNES: Right.O'REILLY: But the only other option is Joe Biden.PARNES: Right. And the vice president takes votes away from her. That's scary to some people.O'REILLY: So they want her -- him to come in. Do they want -- these donors, these fat cats? They want him?They want to be listened to. I feel like a lot of people I talk to are being ignored by the Clinton campaign.PARNES: They want to be listened to and I feel like a lot of people that I talk feel like they're being ignored by the Clinton campaign.O'REILLY: All right.

Abbott: Ted Cruz has the prescription for what ails America	"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" February 25, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Now to Senator Ted Cruz in his home State of Texas, Cruz is leading big there brand new Monmouth University poll likely Republican Texas voters shows Senator Cruz with 38 percent, Donald Trump sits in second place 15 points behind Senator Cruz at 23 percent, Senator Marco Rubio and third place of 21 percent, Dr. Ben Carson fourth place with 6 percent and Governor John Kasich in fifth place with 5 percent. Texas Governor Greg Abbott who has endorsed Senator Cruz goes ""on the record."" good evening, sir.GREG ABBOTT, TEXAS GOVERNOR: Good evening, Greta and congratulation on your 3,500th Show. I'm glad to be part of your next 3,500.VAN SUSTEREN: Governor, thank you very much. I appreciate it. All right, governor, you want Senator Ted Cruz as the next president, why?ABBOTT: Because Ted Cruz has the prescription for what ails America. He is a constitutionalist who will put the United States back on its constitutional pathway. He has an economic plan that will peal away all the heavy hand of government that will allow America to begin to create jobs and that having worked side by side with Ted Cruz behind the scenes for five years when he served as my solicitor general, I have the confidence in him as being a terrific commander and chief.VAN SUSTEREN: Now you've been a governor, obviously, running a state down in Texas. Does it give you some sense of pause that Senator Cruz is in the U.S. senate and he is not, for instance, a governor running a state? He doesn't have any experience that way.ABBOTT: Based in that it because I know Ted Cruz, because I know his decision-making process, because I know the thoughtful and methodical way. His approaches very tough issues, I have confidence that whatever issue may arise, he is the right person to lead the country.And look at one of the most consequential issues that we're dealing with at this time and hat is the future pathway of the constitution itself. I trust Ted Cruz to appoint the right person to the United States Supreme Court.VAN SUSTEREN: What do you make of sort of the double-barrell of pointed at him, the political double-barrell got Senator Marco Rubio on one side Donald Trump on the other. They've been pointing their political weapons right at Senator Cruz, lately.ABBOTT: Well, listen, it's what happens in politics but, Greta, here is my take away and that is after Tuesday, there is only going to be two candidates who have ever won a state. And Ted Cruz is one of them. I think that after Tuesday, this race is going to boil down to a two person race. And think about this last fact and that is the states that know Ted Cruz the best. Texas and Iowa where Ted Cruz spent a lot of time, those are the states that are going for Ted Cruz. The more people learn about Ted Cruz and that he is the person who embodies conservative values, I think the more likely people are going to be supporting him as the campaign continues.VAN SUSTEREN: Are you predicting senator Marco Rubio who hasn't won one state and is losing in Florida that he will be out after Tuesday?ABBOTT: Well, Greta, look at it this way, more than or about 40 percent of all of the delegates will be assigned after this coming Tuesday. And Rubio will not have won any state whatsoever. Ted will have won at least two states. He is the only person who will have beaten Donald Trump in any state, and I think it will be a two-person race after this coming Tuesday.VAN SUSTEREN: Governor, always nice to see you. Thank you, sir.ABBOTT: Thank you, Greta."
