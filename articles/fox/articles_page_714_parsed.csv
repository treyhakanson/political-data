This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Factor follow up segment tonight: The racial division in America. We all know the problem, blacks, whites, Hispanics all see society differently.In Oakland, where they have been many anti-police demonstrations, young girl have the now been enlisted in that cause.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: On a Saturday afternoon in Oakland, a handful of eight to 10-year-old girls are gathered in brown uniforms giggling and eating cupcake. They look like girl scouts. But it's not just fun and games. Take a listen.UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: White policemen are killing black young folks such as women, men and children.UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: Mike Brown, he was shot because he didn't do nothing, only the police officers shot him because his skin color.UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: These girls are called the radical brownies, and instead of learning sewing. They are learning social justice. Even their uniforms have a message.UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: The berets? It's a Black Panther brown beret twist.UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I think it's very appropriate. A lot of the work the Black Panthers did was community oriented.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: With us now to react. Metta World Peace, former NBA basketball player who had a hard scrabble upbringing in Queens, New York, he is the author of the new become ""Metta: Let's Meet the Police.""METTA WORLD PEACE, ARTEST MANAGEMENT GROUP CEO: Yes.O'REILLY: Just out two weeks ago. I know you pay attention to this kind of stuff.METTA WORLD PEACE: Absolutely.O'REILLY: You know, when I saw these 10-year-old girls, I don't think they should be doing that.METTA WORLD PEACE: Well, I 100 percent understand. I'm about 60 percent against it about 40 percent for the effort. I think the effort is good. Speaking out, speaking your mind and being involved in politics.O'REILLY: But they can't possibly understand the nuances of the story.METTA WORLD PEACE: Absolutely. I think with the Black Panther Party I kind of overheard that. And I think it started out promoting, you know, community, and then it went wrong somewhere.O'REILLY: Right. It got a little --METTA WORLD PEACE: Yes. You have four children, right?O'REILLY: Right.METTA WORLD PEACE: Yes. Four children.O'REILLY: Now, they must be paying attention to all this racial business.METTA WORLD PEACE: Absolutely.O'REILLY: What do you tell them?METTA WORLD PEACE: Well, I make sure my kids understand people. Understand that if somebody is racist. It came from somewhere. They didn't just -- they wasn't born racist. Somebody is a gang member. They weren't born a gang member. So, I want to make sure my children understand the environment that they live in.O'REILLY: Okay. So, do you tell them as the mayor of New York City did, to watch out for the police?METTA WORLD PEACE: No, I just tell them not all police are bad. I grew up in environment where police weren't around a lot. And I experienced some profile and I experienced good police. I remember growing up playing basketball. Police actually took off their guns, put it on the ground and played basketball.O'REILLY: Right, in Queens?METTA WORLD PEACE: In Queens. Which is like you never do that, right? So, I explained both sides. And I understand, you know, what everybody is going through right now.O'REILLY: Now, when you wrote this meet the police, what's the message of this book?METTA WORLD PEACE: The message is you don't want to start racial wars or things like that. You want to have solutions. You want to have prevention, tactics and things like that. And you also want to address issues. You just don't want to just push it under the rug.O'REILLY: It's written for children?METTA WORLD PEACE: It's written for children absolutely.O'REILLY: Right.METTA WORLD PEACE: Because you don't want children to grow up hating police or race hating. Hating another race, black hating whites, whites hating blacks. That's why my book is very diverse.O'REILLY: Okay. When you hear someone, you know, look, the Ferguson, Missouri, thing, it was established beyond any reasonable doubt.METTA WORLD PEACE: Right.O'REILLY: That the initial reporting hands up didn't happen.METTA WORLD PEACE: Right.O'REILLY: Okay. Do you feel it's necessary to correct the record to people who believe it did happen?METTA WORLD PEACE: I believe -- I do believe that. And I also believe that the blacks make up 70 percent of Ferguson. And we are only five percent law enforcement and nobody is involved in politics. You know? And if you really want to change a community, you have to get involved in politics. You have to get involved in the school system. You have to try to change.O'REILLY: Absolutely. Blacks are a majority in that town, if they wanted, they could have a black mayor or, you know, they could organize and much.METTA WORLD PEACE: Absolutely. Organize.O'REILLY: And I'm more, you know, I have known you for a while because I'm an NBA fan. And your name used to it be Ron Artest.METTA WORLD PEACE: Used to be.O'REILLY: Why is it now Metta World Peace?METTA WORLD PEACE: Well, I feel I continue to evolve, I continue to connect to people, to the earth.O'REILLY: To the earth?METTA WORLD PEACE: Everything.O'REILLY: Okay.METTA WORLD PEACE: I'm just evolving as a person. And you know, I wanted my name to evolve. And every day, every month I continue to evolve more and more.O'REILLY: Okay. So you want to kind of new age name, Metta World Peace.METTA WORLD PEACE: I just felt like changing it.O'REILLY: What do they call you, Metta?METTA WORLD PEACE: People call me Metta, in China they call me panda.O'REILLY: This year you played basketball in China.METTA WORLD PEACE: Yes.O'REILLY: That must have been a trip.METTA WORLD PEACE: It was great.O'REILLY: Yes.METTA WORLD PEACE: It was great. I enjoyed it so much.O'REILLY: Is there any racism in the Chinese society.METTA WORLD PEACE: I believe it's racism everywhere. I experienced racism in a Chinese society, in New York City when I used to grow up. You know, and people automatically judged me and assumed that I'd wanted to maybe steal something or things like that.O'REILLY: Right.METTA WORLD PEACE: But, you know what? As I get older, I don't judge. I try to come up with prevention, solutions.O'REILLY: And that's the good thing about you. I mean, and you guys that don't follow the NBA, he was the toughest guys, tough players. But then they go Metta World Peace beat me up.(LAUGHTER)METTA WORLD PEACE: You know, very rough on the court.O'REILLY: Thanks a lot for coming on.METTA WORLD PEACE: Thanks for having me.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SEAN HANNITY, HOST (voice-over):  Tonight...DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  The Clintons have a sordid past. We will be the very bright and clean future.HANNITY:  Donald Trump continues to call out Hillary Clinton for her long history of corruption.  Newt Gingrich is here.Plus, while the Clinton campaign tries to paint Trump as a sexist, tonight, you'll meet three women who say that is a flat-out lie.MELISSA YOUNG, FORMER MISS WISCONSIN:  This is the greatest man I have ever met!TRUMP:  Oh, is the media dishonest!HANNITY:  And the GOP nominee continues to hammer the liberal mainstream media for their biassed coverage.TRUMP:  How dishonest are these people?HANNITY:  Governor Mike Huckabee and Sheriff David Clarke respond.All of that, plus campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and ""The Five's"" Kimberly Guilfoyle are all here.""Hannity"" starts right here, right now.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY:  And welcome to this special edition of ""Hannity,"" ""Road to the White House.""  We're only 39 days away from the election, and Donald Trump continues to hammer Hillary Clinton for her very long history of corruption and scandal.  Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  he American people have had it with years and decades of Clinton corruption and scandal -- corruption and scandal.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP:  And impeachment for lying -- impeachment for lying.  Remember that? Impeach.  They're tired of the lies.  They're tired of the trivial politics.  They're tired of being talked down to, looked down upon and treated like second class citizens.  And they're phenomenal people.  You are phenomenal people.  The Clintons are the sordid past.  We will be the very bright and clean future.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Here now is former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor Newt Gingrich.  All right, 39 days to go.  I'm getting different feels from people, especially as it relates to this Alicia Machado issue.  Should Trump go back to the main focus, which an economy that is -- has disgraceful numbers, foreign policy failures, corruption and scandal, like he's just doing there, and stay off of any of these side issues that Hillary is trying to drag him into in?NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  You know, I've been trying to think about his style.  And as you know, I'm very fond of him.  I've worked very hard, and I really think it's vital for the country that he win and that Hillary Clinton be defeated.And I've concluded that -- Steve Lawrence in ""Golden Rainbow"" on Broadway back in 1968 sang a key song, ""I've got to be me.""  And I think what Trump's got to understand is he's either got to sing ""I've got to be me,"" or he's got to learn a new song, I've got to be president.  They're not the same song.He's got to become much more disciplined.  For a while there, I thought he had really turned a corner.  This last week I think has been, frankly, a lost week, a week which has hurt him, which has shaken his own supporters.And you can't tweet at 3:00 o'clock in the morning, period.  There's no excuse ever, not if you're going to be president of the United States.So he's really got to decide -- and I think it's very important to understand this.  If he's got to be himself, then he may well not win.  If he's willing to grow into the role of president, then he may win.  In fact, I think he will win.The bigger the issues, the more he talks about raising taxes versus cutting taxes, killing jobs versus creating jobs, defending America versus letting in thousands and thousands of Syrian refugees -- I mean, the big issues, he's going to win in a landslide.  But if he stays down in the mud -- the Clintons are the best mudders I've ever seen, and they'd be perfectly happy to wage the next 39 days in the mud because they know how to survive in mud.HANNITY:  That's interesting to point out.  As we've seen -- you know, I guess it is frustrating, though, on a lot of levels because the Clintons have all, you know, all the bimbo eruptions, all of the smearing of women, all the money from Saudi Arabia and countries that mistreat women, kill gays and lesbians and persecute Christians and Jews -- the double standard is frustrating.  And watching as an observer, I'm frustrated.  But he's the candidate.  That's maybe something I would say or you would say...GINGRICH:  Right.HANNITY:  ... as an -- as, you know, in my case, a talk show host, and you as a former speaker.GINGRICH:  Yes, I mean, he has to present to the country for the next 39 days a methodical, strong, clear vision of making America great again, to use his own slogan.  And he needs to spend a lot more time preparing for this next debate because he only had Lester Holt in this last round.  When you get somebody who is as opposed to him as he's going to have when they have that town meeting -- Anderson Cooper is viscerally, deeply opposed to Donald Trump.  I mean, this will be basically at least three on one with the two moderators plus Hillary.He's got to go into there having done what every professional athlete would do.  Look at the game film of the last game, figure out what you did wrong. Figure out what you've got to improve.  And it can't be lackadaisical. He's got to decide that saving America and making America great again is worth his subordinating himself to the difficult process of becoming president of the United States.  And that's very different than just being a candidate.HANNITY:  In many ways, he had done that, especially in the last six weeks leading up to this week.GINGRICH:  Absolutely.HANNITY:  You would agree with that.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... going back to what he was doing.GINGRICH:  I actually thought coming out of the debate, he was fine.HANNITY:  Right.GINGRICH:  You know, I was on your show immediately afterwards.  I thought, strategically, he was fine.  And then the media, of course, had been set up in a way you and I didn't appreciate.  This whole thing was an ambush.But the correct step there is to sidestep the ambush.  Didn't get sucked into it.  All he had to say was, Look, they want to make something out of a 20-year-old business decision, I want to create jobs.  They want to talk about 20 years ago, I want to tell you how we're going to fix the economy.You just build a litany.  You learn a trained -- you know, I didn't get to be a good debater by randomly doing it.  It takes training.  It takes thinking.  It takes learning your own mistakes, going, Wow, I didn't know I did that.And so I really hope that this is a wakeup call for him.  Quit tweeting without somebody looking over your shoulder.  Don't ever tweet late at night.  And prepare to really study and get ready for a serious debate because he's really -- this next debate is going to be very important for how people judge him and whether or not they think he's capable of being president.HANNITY:  In other words, will he make the adjustment?  Look, I think -- as far as I'm concerned, Hillary -- she shot every bullet in her attack gun against Donald Trump, and he left a lot on the table, especially about e- mails and servers and lying and dishonesty and Benghazi and ""Obama care"" and Iraq and Syria and ISIS and vetting refugees and immigration and a wall.  There's a lot left here for him to bring up.GINGRICH:  Look, if you're trained...HANNITY:  And making that list, I think, would be important.  I'm sorry. Go ahead.GINGRICH:  No, no, no.  You're doing great.  Look, it's your show.(LAUGHTER)GINGRICH:  But I'm excited to say this.  Look, when you look at -- get the transcript of the last minute-and-a-half of the debate, where she goes on this huge detour to get this attack on Trump, she's being a professional debater.  She knows what her message is.  She's going to get it across, no matter what.The key to these thing is if Anderson Cooper asks you something stupid, you say, Gosh, that's a really interesting topic and it reminds me that I wanted to talk about how we're going to create jobs, Anderson.  I'm so glad you brought that up because, you know, creating jobs is really important.But you don't stick on -- you don't let him define what the debate is.  And you go back and look at my best debates in 2011 and 2012, I consistently reframed the media and got to the topic I wanted to talk about, not the topic they wanted to talk about.HANNITY:  I will say this.  You are one of the better debaters out there by far, and it led to a lot of success.  You did win an important primary in South Carolina as a result of some of those debates.You know, it is important -- you know, for me, this is so substantive and the differences are so profound.  It is kind of sad on one level that if Hillary can robotically memorize lines written by others and deliver them because she's been in politics, as you pointed out the other night, 46 years, not 30 years -- that somehow, that's viewed as presidential.And if somebody looks at that as superfluous and nonsensical, in a way, it-- it -- in other words, we'll ignore the vetting of refugees issue, which their differences are deep and profound.  Hillary's willing to gamble with people's lives, Trump is not.  Trump is listening to our top intelligence officials, she is not.But people would be more interested in the style than the real substance. That's a little troubling to me.GINGRICH:  Well, but remember, because you're a conservative and you've been through this.  I go all the way back to Reagan and the early days of the Reagan campaign for president.  If she didn't have the elite media in the tank for her, she would be down -- she'd be down at 30 percent.HANNITY:  That's true.GINGRICH:  I mean, the only reason she's -- but that's a fact.  It's not a problem.  What you do about it's a problem.  Every conservative has to start out in the morning and say, I realize all the media -- The New York Times will oppose me, The Washington Post will oppose me, NBC, CBS, ABC, you go down the list, they're all going to be against me.  Now, how do I design a campaign and how do I go into a debate knowing that that's the bias?And it's like sailing and understanding you got to learn to tack.  You never go straight into the wind because you can't.  So you got to figure out, How am I going to maneuver around these biases, and turn it back on her?  If she didn't have the elite media, given exactly what you just said, she would be losing by an enormous margin right now.HANNITY:  Really, really good advice.  I hope people are listening. Thanks, Mr. Speaker.  Appreciate it.GINGRICH:  Great.HANNITY:  And coming up next on this special edition of ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MELISSA YOUNG, FORMER MISS WISCONSIN:  Vote for Mr. Trump.  Give yourselves that sense of peace.  Give that to your children.  He's the greatest man I have ever met!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Clinton campaign's trying to paint Trump as sexists, but our next guest, who knows him very well, says that's 100 percent not true.  Wait'll you hear this incredible story.Plus, Donald Trump continues to pound the campaign trail.  Today, he was in the great state of Michigan.  We're going to play highlights, and we'll speak with Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway.That and more straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)YOUNG:  This is the greatest man I have ever met!  His heart is made of pure gold.  He saved me in so many ways, and changed my world.  Yes, he gave me a lot of gifts in my life, a gift of compassion and showing my son how to pay (ph) it forward.But above that, if this man becomes president of the United States of America, he is going to give me the best gift ever, and that is I'll know that when I leave this world, I won't be here to watch my son grow, but I'll know that he is going to grow up in a country that is safe.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity."" That was former Miss Wisconsin, Melissa Young.  That was back in April giving a very heartfelt endorsement of Trump as she fights for her life.  And while Hillary Clinton and her liberal cohorts are trying to paint Donald Trump as sexists, my next guests say that couldn't be further from the truth.Joining us now to explain, former Trump International vice president Senada Adzem is with us, former Miss California USA Carrie Prejean Boller, and the woman you just heard from, former Miss Wisconsin Melissa Young.Melissa, you're really fighting for your life even still.  I had the honor of meeting you myself.YOUNG:  Yes, sir.HANNITY:  Tell us the story about you and Donald Trump and your health.YOUNG:  Yes, sir.  You're correct, I am fighting for each and every day. And what happened was, I stood on his stage when he owned the Miss Universe organization.  I competed in the Miss USA pageant in 2005.  Many years later, I became ill, and really in the darkest days of being sick in the hospital -- and I have never told him this personally, but that morning, the priest had come and read me my last rites.And that day, an envelope was delivered to my room that said, Must be delivered by 8:00 AM.  It was handwritten by Mr. Trump.  And when it was opened, it was a letter saying, To the bravest woman I know.  And he wanted me to keep fighting.  And in that moment, it sparked something in me that I realized, like, my purpose is to fight and I need to get up and fight.  And he really sparked such a wonderful...HANNITY:  And you have -- yes, you have an 8-year-old little boy...YOUNG:  Yes, sir.HANNITY:  ... and your illness, your doctors say...YOUNG:  I do.HANNITY:  You're fighting literally every day for your life.  You don't know -- what is the prognosis that they're telling you?YOUNG:  Right.  Correct.  There is no cure for me.  My heart is now in the condition of a 90-year-old woman.  And since the message is coming from my brain, the part of my brain that controls my autonomic nervous system, which is all the automatic functions that we don't think about, like heart rate, blood pressure, all of those things, digestion, which explains the tube I have here -- that part of my brain shut off like a light switch, and there is no way to manipulate the brain to tell it to turn back on.So I cannot get a new heart because it will send the same message to a new heart.  So I have a heart in the condition of a 90-year-old woman, and I am fighting each day.  And I just had a blood clot removed less than 48 hours ago from my chest, and I'm here today because until my last breath, I will use this voice to speak up to talk about who Mr. Trump really is.  It is so important that this side of the story is told.HANNITY:  Let me go to you, Carrie.YOUNG:  He's the most wonderful man I have ever met.HANNITY:  Well, it's a pretty deep story.  And you're in our thoughts and prayers, by the way, Melissa.  Thank you for coming on.YOUNG:  Thank you so much, Sean.HANNITY:  Carrie...YOUNG:  Thank you for having me.HANNITY:  ... when you were under fire -- and you were under heavy fire -- I remember you at one point told me there was only two people in your whole-- in your universe that stood up for you as the world turned against you, and one of them was Donald Trump.CARRIE PREJEAN BOLLER, MISS CALIFORNIA USA 2009:  Yes.  It's good to be with you Sean.  Thank you so much for having me on.  And I just Melissa's story -- I mean, she's just such a woman of courage.  She truly is amazing, and her bravery is so inspiring.  So thank you, Melissa.yes, to answer your question, Sean...YOUNG:  Thank you, Carrie.BOLLER:  ... yes, Donald Trump was one of the only people that stood up for me and defended me.  And I am so tired of the nonsense and the attacks against him.  I mean, they are so desperate, Sean, that they are going to go at all lengths to try to destroy this man.  This is a smear campaign to try and distract people from the real issues.And Donald Trump -- this is the type of man that he is.  Listen to Melissa. Listen to her story.  And listen to my story.  He defended me.  He stood up for me.  He took every single one of my phone calls.  He did not have to do that.  This is a businessman who's running multiple businesses.  He took every single one of my personal...HANNITY:  And he actually defended Alicia Machado, by the way, you know, beyond the quote...BOLLER:  Right.  Exactly.HANNITY:  ... he actually said it's a very tough position.BOLLER:  Yes.HANNITY:  And we can talk about beauty contests here, too.  This is not...BOLLER:  Right.HANNITY:  Yes.BOLLER:  Let's put it into context here, Sean.  I mean, let's not forget this is a beauty contest.  This is a contest that...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Amen.BOLLER:  ... that hypes up, you know, how women look.  And you know, part of it is walking on stage in a bikini, and God forbid, you know, some women might need to shed a few pounds and some women might need to gain a few pounds.HANNITY:  My doctor called me fat a couple of years ago, so I started working out and I lost some weight.  That's what he (ph) did.BOLLER:  I mean, it's just said that we're talking about this.YOUNG:  And Sean, it's just -- in 20 years, Sean, you should come forward and say something about that.HANNITY:  Yes.  Yes.  Exactly.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  I'm going to call him out on national TV.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There you go.HANNITY:  Senada, you're in a different position because you worked for Donald Trump, and you worked on his biggest projects, one of -- you were vice president.  And you hear these attacks.  What do you say to people because you know him?SENADA ADZEM, FMR. TRUMP INTERNATIONAL VP:  Well, first and foremost, I want to say to people to listen to amazing, inspiring women like Melissa. And I can relate.  I think that many times, and she's truly, you know, just a beautiful woman inside and out.  But she is such an impactful, inspiring woman.Based on my experience -- I worked at Trump International from 2003 until 2007.  I can tell you that he's a very tough businessman, but he's very fair.  He gave women the same opportunities that he gave to men, and you had to prove yourself.  You had to work really, really hard.HANNITY:  And Carrie, when you compare how Hillary and her husband treat women, and the media doesn't cover it, and -- you know, I'm going to crucify Gennifer Flowers, and about Monica Lewinsky, a ""narcissistic looney toon"" -- that never gets covered by the media, does it.BOLLER:  Right.  Right.HANNITY:  And not only that, the allegations of Kathleen Willey and Juanita and Paula Jones, et cetera.BOLLER:  Right.  Right.  And let's not forget she spent over $100,000 bullying these women who didn't deserve it.  So if she's such an, you know, advocate of women and their rights and supporting women, why was she tearing these women down?  She should have been building them up and believing their stories, like she says we all should.HANNITY:  Yes.  All right, guys, I want to thank you all for sharing your stories because...YOUNG:  Thank you.HANNITY:  ... something the media won't do, and that's give another side...YOUNG:  Thank you.HANNITY:  ... of the story, but -- and Melissa, you especially, and all of you, you're in our thoughts and prayers...YOUNG:  Thank you.HANNITY:  ... and we wish you the very best every day...YOUNG:  Thank you so much.HANNITY:  ... and the best to your son, also.  Thank you.And coming up, we have highlights from Donald Trump's rally earlier tonight in Michigan.  His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, will join us next.Plus, first lady Michelle Obama has been trying to rally Hillary Clinton supporters.  But does she really -- what does she really, really think about her?  We'll show you some tape.

We're going to do it.  Our country is going to be greater than ever before.  We're going to be the smart country again.The people of this country are tired of the lies!  They're tired of trivial politics!  They're tired of being talked down to, looked down upon and treated like second class citizens!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP:  This will finally be the year that the American people say enough is enough!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  And a brand-new national FOX News poll just released today shows, in a four-way matchup, Clinton and Trump are now neck and neck.  There is a 3-point difference within the margin of error.Joining us now with reaction is the Trump campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne, good to see you.KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Hi, Sean.HANNITY:  You know, one of the things Newt said that I thought was pretty -- pretty smart -- enlightening, bright guy -- is -- I understand Mr. Trump's frustration with an abusively biased media.  They're never going to tell the story of the smearing, the slandering, the besmirching, the bimbo eruptions and all of these issues.  There'll always be a double standard.And what he was suggesting is, is that Mr. Trump subordinate his personal feelings to the larger message, which is, Here are our differences on Supreme Court justices, on vetting refugees, on saying radical Islam, on building a wall, on education back to the states, on energy independent, on repealing ""Obama care.""  What do you think?CONWAY:  I agree completely in that -- look, Hillary Clinton cannot run on her record, OK?  She's got this bad conundrum where she (INAUDIBLE) be held accountable for what's a really unremarkable record in the United States Senate.  I think there are three bills passed with her name on it.  I know she sponsored other ones, but go and look at the information.She has a very checkered record as secretary of state.  And yet she doesn't have the benefit of incumbency.So if you actually make a contrast between her views and yours, her vision and yours, and you hold to account on women -- Sean, how many thousands of women has Donald Trump employed over his career?  They've been compensated. They've been respected.  They've elevated throughout the ranks of the Trump corporation, many of them.  They occupy some of the highest levels...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... some of the women on that he -- that have either worked for him or that he has treated so nicely.  And it's a very different story what the Clintons will spin or the media will spin.CONWAY:  That's right.  And Sean, as everyone knows, watch what I do, not what I say when it comes to how you treat people.  And the point is that he has been very good to women throughout his life as a non-politician.Secondly, the Clinton Foundation takes money from all of these countries where women and girls are not treated with respect.  They don't have basic rights.  Millions of dollars have gone to the Clinton Foundation.And I think the frustration is all the incomplete coverage.  We don't hear anything about the five people who have taken immunity as connected to the FBI investigation of the e-mail scandal.  Cheryl Mills took immunity and then acted as her attorney in the same investigation.  So there's a great deal of frustration about what's covered.But I agree.  You take the case, you be -- you take the issues set to Hillary Clinton, and you win.  And that's also why she didn't really talk about issues the other night when she got the microphone.  She got through that five or six-point checklist of things she wanted to make sure that she was going to say.  They're there to talk about issues, and she's yelling ""Squirrel!"" and then, of course, making a big deal of it afterward.HANNITY:  Yes.  Because I do think this is what the election -- at the end of the day, I think people are going to look at, OK, the economy is not good, 12 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, the worst recovery since the '40s, lowest home ownership rate in 51 years, lowest labor participation rate in the '70s -- that is huge.And then if you look her record in Benghazi, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Russian reset, supporting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, China's territorial ambitions, North Korea's nuclear ambitions, nothing's really gotten better.  Nothing has been solved.I think that was a good point that Donald Trump made at the debate the other night -- 30 years, all talk, no action.CONWAY:  That's right.HANNITY:  What have you done?  But that's not what she wants to talk about.CONWAY:  He did say that.HANNITY:  And it seems the media wants to stay focused on this former Miss whatever that was -- you know, threatened to kill the judge, that lady.CONWAY:  And Sean, look, when Donald Trump did say at the debate, a very strong moment for him and something that won't change between now and November 8th -- who represents the past, who represents the future?  Who represents change in Washington in a very disruptive outsider way, and with business experience, and who represents more of the same?  So if you are one of the 70 percent of Americans who tells pollsters you want to take this country in a new and different direction, your choice is clear.And I'm really struck by your new FOX News poll, Sean, that the ballot is still tight.  If you listen to the pundits about Monday night, she should be at 82 percent by now and 110 percent among women, and she's not.  She's still well below 50 in your FOX News poll.  Why?  Because people already know her.  Their mind about her representing the status quo and having this very checkered and underwhelming record, they know that doesn't change over the course of a 90 minute debate.  The other thing that struck me in the FOX News poll are the attributes and the positions on who can handle these positions better.  These two voters are really tied, whereas in past presidential contests there was more of a gulf between the Democratic and Republican candidate in terms of who you trust more on this issue.  And most of those in your poll, they're within the margin of error or really close to it.  So this is a real contest.  We have a lot of days to go.  She practices for a moment.  Donald Trump is out there on the stump every day.  Today in Michigan, people standing in the pouring rain for hours to get into his rally, and then he talked about her globalist policies and the fact he's got a patriotic message to, quote, ""make America safe and prosperous and great again.""  It will come down to that in the end.  HANNITY:  I agree with that wholeheartedly.  Kellyanne, I know you're working hard, but as always, thanks for taking time to be with us.  We appreciate it.CONWAY:  Thank you, Sean.HANNITY:  And coming up, Michelle Obama has been hitting the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton in recent days, but you might remember this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA, U.S. FIRST LADY:  And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House, can't do it.  (APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Ouch.  Back in 2007, well, a lot of people one, including myself, thought that was Michelle Obama taking a shot at Hillary.  We'll check in with Kimberly Guilfoyle and Doug Schoen.  They'll weigh in on that.And later tonight, Sheriff David Clarke, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, they're here to react to the liberal media's bias and their bad treatment of the Trump campaign as we continue on this special edition of ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: The Road to the White House.""  So first lady Michelle Obama has been out campaigning for Hillary Clinton this week and appears in this brand new political ad. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA:  Our children watch everything we do, and the person we elect as president has the power to shape their lives for years to come. Hillary has spent her entire career bringing folks together on behalf of our kids because she beliefs that every child deserves a chance to succeed. Hillary will be a president our kids can look up to, a president who believes in our kids and will fight for them every day.  That's why I believe in her.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Now has Michelle Obama always thought this highly of Hillary Clinton?  Remember when the now first lady said this back in 2007.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA:  One of the things, the important aspects of this race is role-modeling what good families should look like.  And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House, can't do it.  (APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, joining us now with reaction, former Clinton pollster, Fox News contributor, and author of ""Putin's Master Plan"" Doug Schoen, and the co-host of course of the hit show ""The Five,"" Kimberly Guilfoyle.  I think it's pretty clear when you say you can't be in the White House if you can't keep your own house, pretty harsh treatment.  Which Michelle should we believe, though, the one then or the one now?  KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"":  I mean, the irony, right, the irony.  A Hillary Clinton who conducted her own war on women with her scandal plagued --HANNITY:  ""Bimbo eruptions.""  GUILFOYLE:  Unbelievable, treating women abusively.  And then also you see this is somebody who people are supposed to look up to and admire.  This is somebody who would put the White House, the Oval for sale like they did the Clinton Foundation with influence peddling and getting involved in businesses that are state sponsors of sharia and terrorist countries that commit acts of violence against gays, against women, against minorities. So why is this somebody to be admire, to be revered, that should be in the White House?  Michelle Obama didn't think so before.HANNITY:  Doug, on first glance I know as a political strategist you would probably say stay focused on the issues.  DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  HANNITY:  But here's the problem for the Clintons.  Every time they think they're scoring on the issue, like of women, it boomerangs back because now Juanita Broaddrick is talking, now Paula Jones is talking, now Kathleen Willey is talking.  Now we bring up Saudi Arabia and the mistreatment of women and the money they gave to the Clintons.  SCHOEN:  Sean, I was one of Bill Clinton's closest advisers in the White House in 1998 during the Lewinsky scandal.  And all that happened to his approval ratings is they went steadily up because people focused on his leadership and the economy, not --  HANNITY:  Did that surprise you at the time?SCHOEN:  It didn't surprise me because people care about their lives.  You and I have talked about this.  If Donald Trump wants to run against Alicia Machado and not Hillary Clinton, I can tell you, whatever your feelings about the secretary of state, she will be our next president.  And I can say for those who want Donald Trump to be president, talk about the economy, talk about corruption and change most of all, and get off of this stuff because it doesn't help Donald Trump.  HANNITY:  Isn't it the type of thing that people like I would bring up, as a talk show host, or Kimberly, who gives her opinions every day?  Isn't it more of what we would do to bring context to people rather than a candidate?  SCHOEN:  Absolutely.  What you and Kimberly talk about.  And I'm happy to talk about it.  But let me be clear --HANNITY:  On an opinion show?  Wait a minute.  I'm not a journalist.  They keep writing that I'm a journalist.  I keep telling them I am a talk host.  SCHOEN:  But you're a strategist who understands no matter what her vulnerabilities may be, if there's an election to be won, you win it by talking about the issues that people care about.  HANNITY:  OK, so he pivots back.  Do you agree with that?  GUILFOYLE:  Yes.  Look, I think that he's so strong on the economy, on jobs, on creating infrastructure, restoring safety in communities, on national security, there's so many things that you can hit Hillary on, and the polling shows she is very weak-kneed when it comes to the e-mailing scandal.  That is something that he can definitely hit her on.  I wouldn't get distracted by some of these other issues.  I get it.  He doesn't let anybody land a punch.  He's always wanting to counterpunch.  But now just be surgical, be strategic.  You've got what you want --HANNITY:  Let his team surrogates, the talk show hosts who have strong opinions like us and Doug, we can give opinions on that.  And at least that would inform.  I do believe there's an entire generation that don't know Juanita Broaddrick's story, Kathleen Willey's story, Paula Jones' story.  I mean exposing himself, groping, fondling, grabbing, kissing against her will, and an allegation of rape, and, more importantly, the smearing that took place afterward.  SCHOEN:  My best advice is that the Trump campaign should talk to millennials about the economy, the weak economy of Barack Obama, and not get into these extraneous issues which really don't concern how people are going to vote.  GUILFOYLE:  Excellent advice.  She doesn't have a strong economy to fall back on.  SCHOEN:  She doesn't.  HANNITY:  Guys, good to see you both, and appreciate you being here.  SCHOEN:  Thank you.HANNITY:  And coming up next on this special edition of ""Hannity.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Oh, is the media dishonest.  How dishonest are these people?  How dishonest.  (BOOS)TRUMP:  Unbelievable.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump calling out the mainstream media for their abusively biased coverage.  We'll check in with Sheriff David Clarke and former governor Mike Huckabee.  They are here next on this busy news night straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to the special edition of ""Hannity: Road to the White House.""  This week media liberal in the mainstream media have been trashing Donald Trump, and in return Trump fires back.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Oh, is the media dishonest.  How dishonest are these people?  How dishonest.  (BOOS)  TRUMP:  Unbelievable.  Not all, not all, but a big, big fat percentage.  Our campaign is taking on big business and big media and big donors.  We're taking them on for you.  The failed politicians and the arrogant media don't want me to talk about the crime and the violence that's happening in this country.  We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives who are among the most honest people anywhere that I have met.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Joining us now with reaction, former 2016 Republican presidential candidate, former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, as well as Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke.  You know, governor, you've dealt with a corrupt media.  Sheriff you've dealt with a corrupt media.  I've dealt with it my whole life also.  It's all true.  But as Newt said earlier in the program, you've got to factor that in.  It's just a reality that is never going to change, right, governor?  MIKE HUCKABEE, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  That's exactly right. You wake up every day and the first thing you've got to do when you look in the media is to say, the media will never be my friend.  And Donald Trump has to understand they're never going to be for him.  They're always going to be against him.  But it doesn't hurt him with the people because most people don't have any faith in the media.  They have the lowest approval rating that they've ever had in history, and people don't trust the media any more than they trust Hillary.  Let Trump focus on those two facts.  What he said in that little clip you played, that was exactly how to handle it.  Tie to media to the same frustrations that people have about the way this system is rigged, and that's he overcomes them.  Don't dignify them.  Don't give them place by giving too much attention to them because they don't deserve that kind of attention from him.  HANNITY:  And sheriff, look at the death and destruction in Obama's home city of Chicago.  You know, there is something really radically wrong that a president will talk about Cambridge, Trayvon, Ferguson, and Baltimore, but ignore 3,000 shot this year, nearly 4,000 killed since he's been president in his own hometown, and nobody in America knows their names. Isn't that a media that goes with the president's narrative, ignoring real death and destruction, not telling the true story?  SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY:  Sure.  They're covering for him. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.  Look, the liberal mainstream media is dwindling into irrelevancy, Sean, and you know that. Donald Trump understands that this is a dragon that has to be slayed.  The liberal mainstream media, these rags realize that this is their last stand to have any influence over the American public as it relates to presidential politics.And Donald Trump, it's a thing of beauty, continues to play the -- employer a strategy of Mohammed Ali, rope-a-dope.  The media is pounding away, throwing everything they've got like George Foreman was, and every once in a while, Donald Trump looks up, he smiles, and he says ""Is that all you've got?""  And at some point it's going to be November 8th.  The American public is going to fire back and finish them off.  Donald Trump is going to win this election and liberal mainstream media, I want to make that clear, they know that, and I'm telling you right now, they are scared as hell.  HANNITY:  Governor, and that then comes to a strategy for Donald Trump. There are deep, profound differences that will have a dramatic impact on this country bases on who gets elected, everything from the Supreme Court to vetting refugees to protecting our borders to eliminating Obamacare to balancing a budget to lowering taxes to energy independence, to education. These are profound, deep differences.  To what extent does Donald Trump have to balance that agenda and point out the distinct change he's offering versus dealing with falsehoods and attacks?  HUCKABEE:  Well, I think he's got a focus on the differences that he and Hillary Clinton both bring.  Look, one of the things the president does that's most powerful is employ people and appoint people.  Who will Hillary appoint to EPA?  What will they do to the fossil fuel industry?  What will they do to the cost of a tank of gasoline and the cost of heating oil, or the cost of natural gas?  That is going to be a huge difference.  Who is going to be a champion for people, getting manufacturing back that pay decent wages?  Who is going to protect the home of our country against people coming in who are not vetted?  Who is really going to enforce our immigration laws?  Those are the things that Donald Trump --HANNITY:  So as long as he's getting that message out and comparing and contrasting of what the future will look like under her and under him, that's key?  HUCKABEE:  I think it's absolutely the key.  And if he just continues to pound away at that -- look, it's a very obvious that there is a difference between Hillary Clinton having used government as her own ATM to take cash out, doing favors for foreign governments who in turn then gave money to the Clinton Foundation, corruption is rampant.  But in addition to the dishonesty that she brings to this, it's the philosophical bent that she comes with that would be devastating to this country and to the deplorable and irredeemable people that she has no respect for.  HANNITY:  You're deplorable.  We're all in the basket of deplorables. Sheriff, you're in the basket with us.   CLARKE:  Yes.  Look, Donald Trump has created a great vision for America and will make America great again.  Every American can see that, they can envision that.  He's talking about defeating radical Islamic terror.  He's talking about reducing crime and violence in all American cities for all Americans, but particularly in the American ghetto, and he's talking about kick-starting this economy to put people back to work again.  Those are things that affect us here at ground level.  I know the beltway, the bubble and beltway, those people disconnected, the Congress, the Washington politicians, the media leaks, they're all disconnected.  But we down here at ground level, we know what we want, and it's Donald Trump's vision for America.  HANNITY:  Thank you both for being with us.  When we come back we have a very important ""Question of the Day"" sa this special edition of ""Hannity"" continues straight ahead.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Time for our ""Question of the Day"" as we continue on this special edition of ""Hannity."" Should Hillary Clinton apologize to her husband's accusers?  Why?  For the way she treated them and her surrogates treated them, and, oh, I'll crucify Gennifer Flowers and James Carville, drag a dollar through a trailer park, and of course all the other things that were said about all the other women.  Just go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you thinkThat's all the time we have left this evening.  As always, thank you for being with us.  We'll be back on Monday, 36 days to go until Election Day. It's getting interesting.  Have a great weekend.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
