Too soon? No, I'm not talking about one of those horribly insensitive jokes repeated after some horrible crisis where everyone cringes. I'm talking about the race for the White House. I hear people say that all the time that it's too soon to pay attention. Too soon? Really? You think so? I don't, not at all. If you wait even one month, or one more week, to get involved you will be too late, and you don't even want that. Whatever your political parties or views, get involved now and get aggressively involved. Call your favorite candidate's campaign because, yes, otherwise, it will be too late. And you will find yourself powerless with nothing to do but throwing food at the TV any time and every time politics is discussed. That's not very effective. You need to participate. And guess what? The race for the White House is important to you. Just look across your kitchen table. Look at your family, or take a close look at your child as you put that child to bed tonight. And if you were worried, even just concerned, about their future, the time to get involved - really involved - is right now. So, now is not too soon. Waiting, well, that's too late. Am I wrong? That's my ""Off the Record"" comment tonight."	[]	[]
