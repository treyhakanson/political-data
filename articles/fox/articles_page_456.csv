So better to disarm than defend? No thanks. Guns don't cause terror, but it can surely stop it.Trump blames terrorists, but ""The View"" blames Trump.Huffington Post and others somehow blame Christians; yeah, Christians. Their point is, it's not just Muslims who are bad, it's this guys who won't bake cakes. This is what identity politics has done: An attack on Americans used to be an attack on Americans. Now we just can't hold it together, even our president seems more worked up over reactions than realities:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The main contribution of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against ISIL, is to criticize this administration, and me, for not using the phrase ""Radical Islam."" What exactly would using this label accomplish? Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction.(END VIDEO CLIP)Yes, he's ticked. But it's us who should be mad.Here's more blame from The New York Times. You're going to love this: ""While the precise motivation for the rampage remains unclear, it is evident that Mr. Mateen was driven by hatred towards gays and lesbians. This is the state of American politics, driven too often by Republican politicians who see prejudice as something to exploit.""See, it's Republicans, it's not terrorists. But wasn't the terrorist a Democrat?The orgy of blame generated by competing identities obscures a gleeful enemy that now nails soft targets at will. Deflection is denial as we can't admit the problem, which is Islamism. The consequence, the fight is not engaged, it wages longer, more people die. The sooner we admit the problem, the sooner we can get help. Send everyone to Islamophobia-phobia Anonymous to get over your fear of being called Islamophobic because it's not just fear, it's going to be our doom.Greg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET).
