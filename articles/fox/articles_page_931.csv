This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle, along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Melissa Francis and Greg Gutfeld. Its 5:00 in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Seventy days until Election Day and Donald Trump appears to be gaining on Hillary Clinton in the polls. The latest on the survey shows them only seven points apart, as opposed to 13 points earlier this month. Trump citing a major speech to clarify his position on illegal immigration tomorrow, more on that in a moment.But first, Fox News has learned that the FBI is preparing to release some materials related to its investigation of Hillary Clinton's e-mails and it could happen as soon as tomorrow. The White House says it wasn't involved in the decision.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I've seen those reports. I can tell you that the White House did not consult with the FBI about that decision or any of the other decisions that they've made in terms of handling some of the investigative material.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: The FBI's director took questions earlier at a cyber security conference and at one point actually made a joke about the server scandal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: I'd like to take your questions and I'm hoping you're going to think up a question that has nothing to do with Secretary Clinton's e-mails.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. The release of this information will only prolong the e-mail issue for Hillary and she still has to worry about the scandal surrounding her family's foundation. ""The New York Times"" editorial board today said the secretary has an ethical imperative to cut ties with the charity. OK, so an ethical imperative to cut ties with the charity, Bolling. So, that means do it now, don't wait until later. It's problematic. Will it matter and should it resonate with the voters?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: So, why cut it now? I mean, you've $1.5 billion under this -- whatever the business arrangement they had going on -- now, all of a sudden it's unethical to continue? I hope they do continue and I hope Citizens United continues to produce (inaudible) request and produce documents. I hope Judicial Watch continues too. But it took someone, I believe it's either CBS or CNN that got the FBI to release these -- I guess they're going to release these transcripts of the interview.For me, that's going to be the most important thing. Yes, the other stuff is going to be interesting but there is about 30 pages that are transcribed into paper that interview that when they went to Hillary Clinton's house and spent a couple of hours with her. I'm dying to know what they ask her. I'm dying to know if they pushed her. I'm dying to know if they were there to find out.GUILFOYLE: What do you think, thought, really?BOLLING: I think they spent an hour or so and said, you know, hey, let me get through these questions. I'm guessing and it's too early -- we shouldn't speculate, but I'm guessing there wasn't a lot of second, you know, going back every two and three times like, are you sure you didn't, you know, are you sure you didn't do this? Or are you sure you didn't know there was any classified material on these? Did you know they were going to classify them as highly classified later on? Are you sure -- are you innocent in all this? I'm guessing it wasn't that hard of an interview.GUILFOYLE: Well, but also the problem is, Greg, what, no recordings so it's relying on some notes and what was ever, you know, documented.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah, but the issue here is that the problem with a story like this is that it's constantly releasing new information over time. It's like cracks in the foundation of a house. It's a problem that prolongs the problem because it's not happening at once. It's happening every other day.And the problem -- the difference between this and a house is Hillary Clinton can't move out of herself. She is stuck with this and this is going to keep going on. It shows the cynical nature of the Clintons. She's like a high school on Sunday, unprincipled (ph).GUILFOYLE: How much ahead did you prepare for that? I like it.GUTFELD: It was that hour.GUILFOYLE: Exactly. All right, so Juan, is this going to be problematic for her or do you have any problem with it at all?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, yeah, I got two problems with it. One is, I think that they should have closed this foundation a long time ago. I mean, I just think it invites all sorts of scrutiny and questions about ethics, because it looks like quid pro quo on the surface. I don't care if it's ethical and I would just reiterate no evidence of illegality.But it just looks like politicians lining, not their own pockets, but at least their reputations and opening a door to favors with their friends. I just don't like it. I just don't like it, whatever. And that's why I was surprised to hear you say, oh, don't close it, why close it.BOLLING: Because I want to see what else turns up.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: It appeals to your conspiracy theory but it does not -- is there a question...BOLLING: ...conspiracy theory when you have people who are buying influenceWILLIAMS: No, there's no evidence of that.MELISSA FRANCIS, GUEST CO-HOST: Their buying access.BOLLING: There's no evidence. What Melissa just said is true. You can you say that in their minds they think they're buying access...GUILFOYLE: It's like bottle (ph) service at the White House.WILLIAMS: But nobody -- there's no evidence that anybody actually got a favor done.BOLLING: Again, can I just (inaudible), I'm sorry, Melissa, but here's what I was trying to tell you, is I really would like to see the 33,000 e-mails that are destroyed right now because maybe that's where all the quid pro quo of it lies.WILLIAMS: You know what this is? I mean, you are scraping and scratching. I mean, you're just trying to build a conspiracy theory as some reason to have some hope for Donald Trump in this election.FRANCIS: I think you're trying to...BOLLING: No, but 96 (ph) percent of America agrees with me so, it's not...WILLIAMS: No, no, no. They agree what? They agree with what?BOLLING: That there's a problem with the Clinton Foundation.WILLIAMS: I just said that. You're the one that doesn't want to close it. I'm the one that wants to close it.GUILFOYLE: Don't worry, Juan, we got the transcripts of you from Fox News Sunday. I saw it and I heard it.WILLIAMS: Yeah, I've been on this record for...FRANCIS: I agree with Juan. I think what the ""New York Times"" said today is the most devastating because they said that what they're doing is they're giving access to big donors. They're selling access. You can't be the party of the people and say that you're standing up for the poor and then sell access to the highest donors.GUILFOYLE: Right.FRANCIS: That doesn't make sense. You can't put up a velvet rope and then say your whole purpose for being is you're helping the little guy. It totally undermines their entire philosophy, why they say they're in politics and it proves that they're hypocrites.GUILFOYLE: All right, so we add another issue for Clinton right now -- the marital drama, Greg, between her long-time top aide, Huma Abedin and husband, Anthony Weiner. Now, here's Donald Trump on that.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: But in the case of Anthony Weiner, she's married to a guy that is uncontrolled. He is a sick person and, you know, she has access to classified information. Huma Abedin has access to classified information. How Hillary got away with that one, nobody will ever know. But to think that it's very likely that much of this information, Anthony Weiner would know about.(END AUDIO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Greg?GUTFELD: It's an interesting story. Weiner, this is all self-sabotage, I mean, he knew that if Hillary wins he wasn't going along for the ride. There was no way he was moving to Washington. He was looking at the big picture or perhaps the small picture. But here's the bigger issue, he's interesting because he's a compulsive pervert. She's potentially more dangerous but she's not as interesting or exciting. But her background potentially gives hints that there might be something else going on there, whether with her mother's involvement in that radical Islamic journal and there's other things going on there that kind of make you wonder what's there? But unfortunately, Anthony Weiner's perverse compulsions, his desire to expose himself constantly is just more interesting than what may be more dangerous.GUILFOYLE: All right. Melissa, do you see this as something that is, yeah, cause for a concern? I mean, certainly something this relevant is when Huma Abedin has been careless and reckless with classified information, leaving it behind, et cetera, schedules and otherwise.GUTFELD: Exactly.GUILFOYLE: And that's been documented, but this is a whole other matter that I guess the taint of it is not good for the...FRANCIS: Yes, I don't know. I'm not really sure how you stretch it over into the Clinton camp. I mean, I know that Greg is dying to say Weiner over and over again.GUTFELD: No, I'm not that predictable.FRANCIS: No you're not, well, OK. Well, I don't know that you stretch it all the way to the campaign. I mean, obviously, to me it shows that Huma Abedin has bad judgment I guess, but you never know what's going in anyone's marriage anywhere.GUTFELD: Yes you do. There was a documentary on it. I know everything about that marriage.FRANCIS: But I think we don't know what's going on in everybody else's marriage. So, I think...GUTFELD: But I know that one.GUILFOYLE: You were invited to the premiere.FRANCIS: ...marriage about everything.GUILFOYLE: OK, all right. Juan, is this a problem?WILLIAMS: I don't think it's a problem, but what the problem is, I can't get over Donald Trump just trying to make politics, make political hay out of the tragedy of this guy's obsession, as you say, Greg.GUTFELD: Sickness.WILLIAMS: Perversion or whatever. I mean, he sees, oh, this is an opportunity to take a shot at Hillary Clinton? I mean to me, it's like wow, leave a disintegrating family alone and a woman in pain alone. And the same thing what happened over the weekend with the shooting in Chicago with Dwayne Wade, the basketball star's cousin. Why is Donald Trump making that into suddenly a political football?GUILFOYLE: Oh, we talked about that.WILLIAMS: I just think it's terrible. FRANCIC: Because there was a political point there. I mean, that was pointing out something that he has been drawing attention to, the idea that you have failed inner city problems...WILLIAMS: The larger point -- the larger point may have some legitimacy, Melissa, but at that moment you have somebody dead.FRANCSIS: Yeah, the way he did it was bad -- Yeah, no, no. Definitely the way he did it was bad.BOLLING: So, on the Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin, the difference here is that Anthony Weiner clearly doesn't know how to use the internet. He's now failed twice, miserably, accidentally sent out a picture of himself to the full internet once when he was trying to direct message to someone else.So, if he's in on these security briefings or she has a security briefing that she tends to leave behind stuff like schedules and he reads it and he -- there's the difference, OK. That's why that's different from the other side...GUILFOYLE: But also, he shouldn't be around children the way he behaves. That's the Child Protective Services.WILLIAMS: That's the big issue.BOLLING: That has nothing to do with Hillary or security.GUILFOYLE: No, but I want to put it out there for the viewers as a former child abuse prosecutor.BOLLING: Here's the hypocrisy of the left though, how many times over the last couple of weeks have we heard about Steve Bannon's 20-year-old divorce? A hundred times? That shouldn't be in there either but the left likes to make a lot out of that as well. They're saying here's a guy who is advising Donald Trump. He's CEO of...WILLIAMS: You know, this is an example...BOLLING: ...talking about his 20-year-old divorce, yet, Huma Abedin is now a victim.WLLIAMS: Excuse me, is Huma Abedin out there saying things like women should get off the internet because they're ruining it for men who want to say crude things about women? No. That is Steve Bannon's history, right. So, Steve Bannon has a history of saying obnoxious things about women. He then is revealed to have had in his divorce proceeding violence against women and you say, oh, there's no relevance. Of course it's relevant.BOLLING: The left is using a 20-year-old case, pulling up...WILLIAM: Because he is now...BOLLING: ...years ago, but Huma is somehow...WILLIAMS: Hold on. Remember that Donald Trump has a history of saying things that are viewed as misogynistic against women, and so now you have Bannon comes in, he had his own history with women and you say it's irrelevant.BOLLING: And Hillary has a history of possibly losing e-mails...WILLIAMS: All right, here we go, possibly -- possibly this and...GUILFOYLE: Well, there is something else to talk about you two. Donald Trump is gearing up for a big speech tomorrow. Remember that? To stave off critics who said that he has flip flopped on immigration. Rick Perry, one of his former opponents turned supporter is coming out in defense of the GOP nominee.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)RICK PERRY, FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR: Donald Trump is not softening his position on immigration. Donald Trump is going to secure that border in all the different ways that you have to do that. He is committed to not only immigration reform that lets the people in that we want in this country, but those that have come in, overstayed their visas, those that have come in, that are criminal elements. Those individuals are going to be rounded up and dealt with appropriately.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK, so is this helpful, Melissa, that Governor Rick Perry, someone who people look to actually for guidance but he did a good job in terms of the border and was on point on that issue.FRANCIS: See, I actually think that this has turned into Rorschach painting but -- Donald Trump is out there with this immigration policy and it's what you see on the dots. It's however you look at it. And he's kind of maybe this, maybe that and this one says this, this one says the other thing.So now in a way, everybody can see what they want to see and the people that were afraid that he was racist and he was too far to the right, well, he's not really going to do that after all, and everyone maybe at this point hearing what they want to hear.GUILFOYLE: Sounds like a political win.FRANIS: So what seems to be bad could be good, yes.GUILFOYKE: In terms of the strategy that leads to around...FRANCIS: Yeah.GUTFELD: It exposes people's lack of principle. I mean, yesterday Rush Limbaugh admitted that it really doesn't matter what Trump says and we talked about it before. You know, Rush said, ""I knew he really didn't mean it. So it didn't matter."" And people who knew that he didn't mean it got trashed for it.So now, he has -- I think he should apologize to everybody he has made fun of for sharing the same beliefs he does. And I think, you know, I get it, Perry's, you know, being the good soldier, but, you know Dick Morris the viewer.WILLIAMS: But you know what...GUILFOYLE: Speaking of Pete (ph), he could have had ""Dancing with the Stars.""WILLIAMS: I can't believe that he...GUTFELD: Dick morris?GUILFOYLE: No, Rick Perry.WILLIAMS: I can't believe that Trump basically said, ""Oh, Obama's plan on illegal immigrants is a terrific plan."" I mean to me, how did Obama made sense to that?FRANCIS: But the difference is, he's saying you have to enforce it. I mean, I think that's how we really...WILLIAMS: No, no, no. He says that it was more aggressive but that's how...FRANCIS: ...you have to enforce the law.WILLIAM: No, but he said that's the plan. I just can't believe that out of Donald Trump's mouth comes, ""Oh, Barack Obama has the best immigration plan. Where is Jeb Bush? Where is Marco Rubio? Gang of Eight?FRANCIS: Jeb Bush is mad (ph). He's mad (ph).GUILFOYLE: Speaking of mouths, sometimes what comes out of this one...GUTFELD: Wait, I did not say that.GUILFOYLE: Oh, guess what the (inaudible) gave for me.BOLLING: Can I weigh in on immigration?GUILFOYLE: OK. I'm trying to save our show. Go ahead. I'm kidding.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Let's do this. I'm waiting to see what he has to say tomorrow night.GUILFOYLE: And then you'll see?BOLLING: Then we'll judge it.GUILFOYLE: All right. Next, is Russia trying to undermine our presidential election by hacking into our voting systems? It appears so. The FBI director addressed that very concerning threat this morning. We're going to tell you all the details we have ahead. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Some very serious new concerns about Russia attempting to meddle with our presidential election. The FBI is now investigating the hacking of elections systems in both Arizona and Illinois and had issued a warning to state election officials nationwide to beef up their cyber security measures. U.S. officials suspect Russian hackers were behind the breach. The FBI director Jim Comey was questioned about it today at a cyber security conference.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: We take very seriously any effort by any actor, including nation states, maybe especially nation states, that moves beyond the collection of information about our country and that offers the prospect of an effort to influence the conduct of affairs in our country, whether that's an election or something else.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Moscow-backed hackers have already been blamed for leaking most documents and e-mails stolen from the DNC. Also earlier this month, the Homeland Security chief warned about this exact issue, listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEH JOHNSON, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We are actively thinking about election cyber security right now. We should carefully consider whether our election system, our election process is critical infrastructure like the financial sector, like the power grid. This is something that we're very focused on right at the moment.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: OK, Greg, Russians are very interested in our election.GUTFELD: Yeah, that's going on. FBI should warn Hillary. I would change her password from, you know, chelseamom2016 because she's the one that's got the problem. You know what worries me...GUILFOYLE: Uh-oh, that's it.GUTFELD: It's not the hacking and the leaking. It's the hacking, the doctoring, and the leaking. So they can hack to your system. They can take mundane information, and then they could insert deviant stuff -- this is my excuse -- insert deviant stuff into your e-mails or attach images, because that's what they're going to do. They're not just going to hack. They're going to doctor it. That's the nature of cyber terror...GUILFOYLE: Look at Bolling. He loves it.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It's the Russians.BOLLING: They hacked his twitter account.GUTFELD: Yeah.FRANCIS: That's what he said the first time he had been hacked, remember that.GUTFELD: Yeah, but.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: They asked him on that. I'm sorry, Greg.GUTFELD: But anyway, I don't think -- they're going to do this to the Republicans, too because the Russians don't see divides. They don't see Democrats or Republican. They just see America. A disruption of our system is what they want.FRANCIS: I'm wondering what high tech voting system they're going to be hacking into. The last time I went to vote in New York City, I mean, it looked like they had moved over people from ""Occupy Wall Street."" I mean, they were sitting there. They couldn't find my name in the list. They gave it to me when I gave them the ballot.I was certain they were throwing it in the garbage behind them. It was a disaster. It took forever. People left in the middle. There was nothing official about it. I was trying to keep a straight face because I had brought my son to show him this civic duty and I am certain that my vote did not get counted.GUILFOYLE: Thompson (ph)?FRANCIS: Yeah, hacking into what? I mean, they had...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In New York?FRANCIS: Yeah. I mean they had pieces of paper and they literally chucked it in a basket behind them when I left.BOLLING: Don't we hear this every four years?WILLIAMS: Not like this year because of what happened with the DNC, the hacking and consensus among the national security, you know, people, the top intelligence folks in the country, is that the Russians were behind the hacking of the Democrats not the Republicans, and then of course you have the Debbie Wasserman-Schultz fallout (ph).BOLLING: That's early.WILLIAMS: Well, I know, that was the hack. It was the hack that led to the leak. But what I'm saying is here you have a situation that Melissa is lamenting the fact that it is somewhat antiquated of a system. In fact, that's somewhat...FRANCIS: True.WILLIAMS: ...protective because they can't hack all the systems. And you can't hack when you got paper involved and clear the paper trail where you count. The danger here is the Russians get involved and they start to ""hey, guess what, we know that Eric Bolling is voting for Donald Trump so, we're going to leave him though but that Juan Williams, that guy -- I think that guys is a Democrat. We'll pull his name out. So, all of a sudden, Juan shows up, he can't vote. Eric shows up, and he can vote.GUTFELD: I love how even Russians say guess what.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: He said that in Russian.WILLIAM: Well, you know me. Just like me. Who knew? A black Russian.BOLIING: For instance...GUILFOYLE: Everybody is like Russian these days.BOLLING: Well, I want KG to put some KG on it.GUILFOYLE: So, let me put little KG flavor on this. When I went to go vote, is much like Melissa's experience, in fact Jurassic Park meets Stars War's bar scene with little Jar Jar Binks, a little velociraptor.FRANCIS: Right.GUILFOYLE: ...and no confidence that this was going to actually get counted out (ph).FRANCIS: Exactly.GUILFOYLE: I had to show them -- look, there's my name right there. No, I got to vote. You know, same thing. And I brought Ronan, it's like, what goes on around here? He said this doesn't look good at all. I mean he was only five and (inaudible), no kidding. So, that didn't work well. But now imagine this is going to be a very dangerous situation for this election. If they look at voting patterns and don't match kind of the past ones and we see wild swings, then we could be in another Bush/Gore, you know, whole situation all over again. Re-enter the Hanging Chad.BOLLING: Are we saying that the Russians wants Donald Trump to win? Is that what you're saying?GUILFOYLE: Or the hanging Russian Chad.WILLIAM: I don't know what to say, I mean, Donald Trump says -- he says he asked the Russians to hack...BOLLING: I think we remember Hillary saying don't worry. We're going to reset as soon as the election is over. She may be as close to the Russian...WILLIAMS: I think that was another election.GUTFELD: Yeah, it was. To your point, no one can be worse on these elections than us. When I was registered at -- in Pennsylvania, I lived there for 10 years. My name was Greg Butfeld.GUILFOYLE: No kidding.GUTFELD: I had to go there and find my voting card just to show I'm Gutfeld but it says Butfeld.BOLLING: Can I tell you one quick anecdotal story. I drop my son off to college, the minute -- he's only a freshman so this all brand new 18-year- olds, they have 200 people running around signing them up to vote -- every single one of them, Hillary Clinton button supporters. Hillary Clinton supporters.WILLIAMS: That's a bad sign for Trump.BOLLING: And I looked over my shoulder and watched him and never said a word to him before in my life about what you are, Republican, Democrat. He checked off Republican. I was like, wow, good job. They all had Hillary stuff on. I'm not even sure that's legal.GUILFOYLE: You just like ruined his like -- buzz kill at college now.GUTFELD: Probably not even watching right now.BOLLING: We'll leave it there. All right, ahead, new (inaudible) from quarterback Colin Kaepernick's decision to sit out the national anthem in protest -- Donald Trump's got a great idea for the 49er unhappy with america. Hear that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: The 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has upset a lot of people -- a lot of Americans with his refusal to stand during the national anthem at a preseason game on Friday. Kaepernick said he doesn't want to show pride in a flag for a country that, quote, ""oppresses black people and people of color."" He is still getting a lot of critical feedback especially in the sports world. Seattlle quarterback Richard Sherman who has taken issue with the Black Lives Matter Movement in the past is weighing in on the controversy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICHARD SHERMAN, SEATTLE QUARTERBACK: There is also a deeper meaning to what he did. You know, he's talking about the oppression of African- Americans in this country and that has been going on for a long time. And I think, you know, a lot of the focus has shifted away from his message and shifted, you know, to some people that was insulted (ph) to him taking a stand against the nation, et cetera, et cetera. So, there is some depth and some truth into what he was doing, you know. I think he could have picked a better platform and a better way to do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Donald Trump's got an idea what Kaepernick should do if he isn't happy with America.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)TRUMP: I think personally it's not a good thing. I think it's a terrible thing. And, you know, he'll -- maybe he should find a country that works better for him. Let him try. It won't happen.(END AUDIO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Well, let me start with you, KG. What do you think of Donald Trump, who is so critical of America, you know, the country is falling apart.GUILFOYLE: What? I don't think he's critical of America. I think he said we could do better.WILLIAMS: At the GOP convention, I never saw such a dark view of America.GUILFOYLE: Well, I don't know. I was .(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But anyway, he says Kaepernick, for being critical, should get out. What do you think?GUILFOYLE: Well, listen, you know, that's -- he is entitled to say what he wants to say that's because we have people who have fought and died on the battlefield to be able for all of us to sit here and give our opinion without fear of reprisal besides Twitter, right?So what I do know today is, that I was with the -- at the - Jets said they have wonderful charity to mention (ph) with Woody Johnson and all the Jets players there. And their quarterback spoke and it was elegant and interesting and eloquent, and delivered a very, you know, passionate speech and talk about the game (ph).And then I was saying, ""You know what? This is fantastic."" I was so impressed with the quality and characters of the individuals there and then I go back, here at my 49er team, you know, what's going on, Colin? I mean, what were you doing? You've been given so much opportunity, just like why do you help bring us together? Why do you have to sit down and to get such an affront to the men and women who have served? If you want, take it to Twitter. But you know what? Stand. You have two legs to stand on because other people have lost theirs.WILLIAMS: Well, so Eric, I think part of what Drew Brees, the quarterback for the New Orleans Saints, says, look, this is about recognizing the military picking up on what Kimberly was talking about. I don't necessarily see it as immediately attached to the military. I think, you know, I'm a proud American. I would just say honor the flag even if you have complaints. But is it only about the military?BOLLING: Well, the flag represents the freedoms that Kimberly points out that fit people who have died. How many wounded warriors have lost both limbs and would love to be able to stand for the National Anthem that can't? Two thoughts, $6 million hundred -- I'm sorry, six year, $114 million contract Kaepernick signed for. Where else in the world besides America can you do that? Maybe a couple of European countries stand for the flag. And you want to talk about oppression, he stated .WILLIAMS: Wait a minute, wait a minute. You're not saying stand for the flag because he gets paid a lot of money?BOLLING: No, because it's the greatest country in the planet .WILLIAMS: I agree with that.GUILFOYLE: He's go a lot of opportunity even with bad stuffs he got paid.BOLLING: But he's saying he's not standing in solidarity with people who are oppressed in America, right? What about the people that those wounded warriors got wounded fighting, the people who are fighting countries, Sharia law countries where women are oppressed, truly oppressed, and gays are murdered? Those people died for that flag for that reason, for the firms ...GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: ... that we have to stand for the flag.WILLIAM: All right. So, Melissa ...FRANCIS: Yeah.WILLIAMS: ... the contrary argument is we've had everything from a woman's rights movement in this country to a civil rights movement to a gay rights movement. Every time we, as America, change, and our great country allows that change, it's because of people who protest and Kaepernick stands in that tradition. Do you buy it?FRANCIS: I don't because I just think -- it feels very small. I mean, I know he is getting a lot of media attention for it. But he is somebody who makes $19 million a year. There're a lot of things he could do in terms of outreach, in terms of charitable deeds, things that people didn't have to see. Or you could make a big splash, you know, making a big gesture. You know, I mean, he could go out and be a role model. He could advocate. He could make speeches. He could go into communities .GUILFOYLE: He can win some game.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: I mean he could bring people on to the field ...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: That's the problem, yeah.FRANCIS: But if instead to sit, instead of standing, you know, to me, it seems almost lazy and small and attention-getting. And I don't know on himself as supposed too (ph) on here is the issue I'm upset about and here is what I'm going to do to fix it, instead he is choosing to just, you know, sit down.GUILFOYLE: Come on. You saw the pictures on the internet of the soldier who lost both his limbs and he's literally on the - he's amputated, where his legs would be standing up like that. I mean, just, when you think about that, it just puts things in perspective. And I thanks Dr. King, if you are alive today, he wouldn't disrespect the flag or the anthem.WILLIAM: I don't think ...GUILFOYLE: He would use his words and his voice to send a message for positive change. And that's the difference.WILLIAMS: So Greg, Spike Lee, the director says, wait a second. In fact, Kaepernick is operating the tradition of Muhammad Ali who refused to go to Vietnam as you know. He's operating the tradition of John Carlos and Tommy Smith who stood at the Olympics with their fist raised, again, to protest the America's treatment of minorities. What do you say?GUTFELD: I pledge I will not stand until Spike Lee makes a good film.All right. Two points here to make. I think Colin is a genius. He put America through a logic experiment. So, what if you sit down during an anthem to protest an oppressive state? But if you were allowed to sit down during the anthem to protest an oppressive state, the state, therefore, is not oppressive. So by sitting down, he actually proved himself wrong, because in other countries, like North Korea or wherever you want, Cuba, you would get killed.What's more interesting to me about this fellow is in a recent press conference he didn't just wear the Malcolm X hat, he wore the Fidel Castro shirt. So basically, mentally, he is someone currently fetishizing radicalism, right? He is turning radicalism into a fetish. It's a phase. He's like a girl discovering Bieber for the first time. He's been in aggressive development .FRANCIS: Guys like Bieber too, look at Bolling.GUTFELD: Yeah, that's true. But don't tell me I've got to go. I'm not done yet. When an athlete goes through a delayed adolescence because he's been playing sports all his life, it's also with celebrities and actors, they get to a certain age they lose their relevance in their career and they go, ""I want to be known for something else."" And so he gets the hat, he gets the shirt. He's got Fidel Castro. And he realized that it's great for his name, because it's all over the cable news. And that's what he's got, and you can't get caught, because then he's caught for political reasons.BOLLING: Well, what's so very important, though, is that he will be sitting on that same bench the whole season anyway.FRANCIS: Right.BOLLING: He wasn't going to start. Maybe he would have a different attitude if he did risk that starting position.GUTFELD: Yup.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Well, some people think he is risking it, because obviously there's something .(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I will tell you this too. One thing that I forgot to leave out, he also said that Hillary should go to jail. We forgot about that.WILLIAMS: Yeah right.GUTFELD: Kind of an interesting thing.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: So, he is all over the map. We can't cover all that Colin Kaepernick is up to.Next, does this school mascot look too scary to you?FRANCIS: Oh, yeah.WILLIAMS: One professor is concerned that Herky the Hawk might frighten incoming college students.GUILFOYLE: Are you kidding?WILLIAMS: Gregory takes this one on when ""The Five"" comes right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: There's so much evil in this world: War, famine, the Red Hot Chili Peppers.And now, team mascots.Apparently one such beast doesn't express enough ""emotional diversity"" and must be changed. I speak of Herky the Hawk from the University of Iowa, whose static grimace has upset one professor enough for her to write to school officials claiming Herky's smirky traumatizes students.Professor Resmiye Oral believes new students need happy faces not angry, violence-inciting ones. She writes: ""I plead with you to allow Herky to be like one of us, sometimes sad, sometimes happy, sometimes angry.""She is right. Look at its face. It's not inviting. I wouldn't want to eat that at Chick-fil-A. It seems so angry. Like an Angry Bird! Angry Birds -- we should ban them too. Imagine what that's doing to our children!Fact is, these days everything is offensive, from common words to costume birds. It's why we need trigger warnings and safe spaces to protect us from these micro-aggressions.The world is so scary, it seems the best thing you can do these days is not be born.So is it possible that a student might actually think Herky is a real monstrous hawk with a grudge and not just some classmate in a costume?It's possible. All this psychological coddling is turning kids into fearful worms.Maybe they should be scared of birds.Juan, scary mascot, like the Redskins?WILLIAMS: Yeah. Well, no. Actually, the guy who used to dress up as the -- was the chief, died this summer. So I don't know what they're going to do about that.GUTFELD: Way to bring it down.WILLIAMS: But they do have lovely ...GUILFOYLE: I know right.WILLIAMS: ... lovely dancers.GUTFELD: Yes, yes.WILLIAMS: You know what? I was - so I have two thoughts about this. One is that I generally prefer the Phillie Phanatic or, you know, the San Diego Chicken happy, crazy guys, you know, who's hopping around. That guy just looks scary to me. It doesn't bother me.GUILFOYLE: Oh my gosh.WILLIAMS: But I love what you have to say because I think this is legitimate trend from, you know, that you highlight, which is micro- aggressions, trigger warnings, safe spaces. University of Chicago this week, you know, said not doing it.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAM: If you come in here, you go to be a big boy.GUTFELD: Yeah, you have to grow up. Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: I love University of Chicago to go back (ph).GUTFELD: Do you like, do you like the 49er mascot? The little gold dig -- with a great -- such a gold digger.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: So he's scary because he has trap .(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It's a gold .GUILFOYLE: Gold digger.GUTFELD: Panner. Yes.GUILFOYLE: Whatever.FRANCIS: Miner. It's a called a miner.GUTFELD: We're 49er fans. And we ended in the 49ers and we can't even think of a name. What's wrong with us?GUILFOYLE: A gold digger. I don't know. I'm lost back in the days of Joe Montana, Dwight Clark, and Ronnie Lott, and Roger Craig, and Charles Haley and Steve Young.FRANCIS: I love Steve Young. He's so hot.GUTFELD: John Taylor. The most underrated receiver, Jerry Rice.FRANCIS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Jerry Rice.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: All right. Can we talk about Steve Young (inaudible) and have he done for us lately? Yeah, we said Steve Young .FRANCIS: OK, good.GUILFOYLE: . and he also is highly intelligent, was a prosecutor, got his law degree.FRANCIS: Very cute boy.GUILFOYLE: Anyway, back to the scary bird.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Right.GUILFOYLE: This goes on to connect to the whole thing we've got, like ban all the Halloween costume, no one can be the sushi chef, no one can be like, you know, any of the angry birds because that might offend someone. It's a joke. There can be nothing left to be like Trump.GUTFELD: Exactly.FRANCIS: And Hillary. You know, we actually almost have Trump as our mascot. Harvard has this angry pilgrim, he looks furious. He's angry white man.GUTFELD: Yeah.FRANCIS: I don't know. I think maybe they should go away with that. What do you think, Eric?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I wrote a book about these, trigger warnings, safe spaces. It was good news to hear University of Chicago, a very liberal university, pushing back .GUILFOYLE: How (ph)?BOLLING: . on the trigger warnings and safe spaces. But I think the scariest thing in Iowa right now, no joke right now, is the price of corn. Corn is crushing the state of Iowa, right?GUILFOYLE: Whoa.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Thirty percent drop in the price of corn in the last month and that is really -- its killing farmers right now. And by the way, we should do a segment on the farm subsidies. That would be very interesting.GUILFOYLE: My farmer.GUTFELD: Are getting creamed.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Oh, that was so .GUTFELD: I love creamed corn.GUILFOYLE: Bolling just avoided that. He avoided the ""Fox and Friends"" segment we were trying to adjourn that into like ...BOLLING: In the afternoon.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, yeah, ""Fox and Friends"".GUTFELD: ""Fox and Fins"", that's what they call it. So wait is over, the new cast.FRANCIS: ""Dancing with the Stars"".GUTFELD: Yeah, they didn't -- they skipped that part. And so ""Dancing with the Stars"" has been revealed. I'm having a problem .GUILFOYLE: What is wrong with you?GUTFELD: I don't know. It's the drugs.GUILFOYLE: A description of Olympian.GUTFELD: Olympian and former presidential candidate. The rest of the list ahead.GUILFOYLE: Rick Perry.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FRANCIS: ""Dancing with the Stars"" revealed its full cast for Season 23 this morning. I know I was waiting with baited breath. Our buddy Geraldo gave us his best shot last season (inaudible). But this time around, stars like '90s rapper, Vanilla Ice will be vying to the Mirror Ball trophy, so will Maureen McCormick. You remember her as Marcia Brady and former presidential candidate Rick Perry as well. Also set to cut the rug, the Olympian who cut out of Rio as fast as he could after lying about a robbery, Ryan Lochte. The swimmer appeared on ""GMA"" this morning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RYAN LOCHTE, AMERICAN COMPETETIVE SWIMMER: And so everyone is blowing this way out of proportion. I think that's what happened. And, you know, like I said, I did lie about that one part. And I take full responsibility. I'm human. I made a mistake. This is perfect with the show because I want to put that behind me. I'm never the one to dwell in the past. I just want to move forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right.FRANCIS: OK. So he dyed his hair. So obviously, you know, Kimberly he is on the straight and narrow now, and he's going on ""Dancing with the Stars"". So perfect celebrity rehab. I think he's all set, Ryan Lochte, yeah, good.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. Well, he's ready to be like the comeback kid. Why not? That's what we do in America.FRANCIS: By dancing.GUILOYLE: What?FRANCIS: By dancing?GUILFOYLE: Well, but he's a great athlete. I'm quite certain he can dance. I mean, don't you think he use his arms, at least, and his legs in some fashion.FRANCIS: Maybe. OK. Vanilla Ice, do you think he's going to win the Mirror Ball?GUTFELD: No. I have advice for Rick Perry, though.GUILOYLE: I love Vanilla Ice.GUTFELD: Avoid Rick Perry. Avoid the three-step because you might forget the third step.BOLLING: Very nice. Well done.GUILOYLE: Yeah.FRANCIS: Because to Bolling, we love ...(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: We love Vanilla Ice.BOLLING: Ice.FRANCIS: We love him. Yeah. Ice, ice baby.GUILFOYLE: Ice, ice baby.BOLLING: And it doesn't matter because the winner has already been decided.WILLIAMS: Who is that?BOLLING: Laurie Hernandez. She's great.GUTFELD: Are you kidding me?BOLLING: I mean -- so let's talk about a ringer. That's what she does. She dances.FRANCIS: Yeah. Not Amber Rose?BOLLING: I don't know. I'll go with Laurie Hernandez.FRANCIS: Juan Williams, do you like Amber Rose? Was that who you were thinking .WILLIAMS: No, I don't sitting here ...GUILOYLE: Be very careful, gentlemen. Yeah.WILLIAMS: ... in between. I was just asking what is her talent. I don't know. But I mean she's, you know, but she's a beautiful woman, I guess. I don't know.GUTFELD: She just wait, I don't know who's .FRANCIS: She breaks up relationship.WILLIAMS: Kanye's ex.GUTFELD: Kanye's ex. Got it. Got it.WILLIAMS: You know, I was inflicted, I was inflicted that Babyface Edmonds ...GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: I think he has, you know, has a great talent. I'm surprised to see his name in there and Laurie Hernandez. But Rick Perry, Rick Perry, when he was running for president, part of the issue was that he had a bad back. So I guess he's made a tremendous recovery.GUILOYLE: Yeah. Well, good for him. He's such a nice guy. I like him a lot. And he was nice when he came on our show.WILLIAMS: Oh, he's very nice.GUILFOYLE: Fantastic.BOLLING: He might be the first one out though. That's always interesting to see to get a little ...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Poor Geraldo ...GUILOYLE: Poor Geraldo. Remember .BOLLING: I don't know.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I think Laurie Hernandez has luck to that.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I think Lochte has a luck.FRANCIS: Not Marcia, Marcia, Marcia? Maybe.All right. ""One More Thing"" is coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILOYLE: It's time now for ""One More Thing"". Eric, what say you?BOLLING: For my ""One More Thing"" very quickly. Numbers are in the books right now, August, Fox is number one, 168 straight months as number one, and they were number one in all the basic cable, not just news, also beating MSNBC and CNN combined in Arabia, 189 months number one.OK. One more thing, ready for this? It's called the greatest play of all time, even better than Clemente's catch in right field, better than Mays' catch over shoulder in center field. It was Rick Monday in 1976, Cubs at Dodger Stadium. Take a look. Here it is right here. Two guys run on the field. That's an American flag. One guy is putting lighter fluid on the American flag. Another guy comes up, ready to light the flag on fire. Rick Monday comes from center field, grabs the flag. Now there, there is a patriotic young man right there. And he was an ex-marine, spent six years in the marines. That's why he didn't want the flag burned. Rick Monday respected the flag. Best play ever.GUILOYLE: God bless. That was a good one boy.FRANCIS: That was a good one.GUILOYLE: Very good. Greg, yours is not going to be out .(OFF-MIC)GUTFELD: Yeah. ""Greg's Secret to Happiness."" You know, there's nothing more soothing when you're down than the smell of a brand new tennis ball. Let's admit that we've taken the can and just inhaled it for hours.GUILOYLE: What a weirdo.GUFELD: As this fellow knows, you can never get enough tennis balls. And if you're ever feeling sad, life isn't giving you lemons, fill up a bucket full of tennis balls and have yourself a ball. Look at that.(CROSSTALK)GUILOYLE: Greg, it's your stunt double.GUTFELD: Yes, it is.(CROSSTALK)GUILOYLE: Sorry.FRANCIS: Trigger, trigger for an ...(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: You look like a happy dog (ph).GUILFOYLE: Go ahead.WILLIAMS: All right. So, it's 70 days until the big election in November, but today is also Election Day and we've got some very hot races for you to keep an eye on. Tonight, the first, top one, John McCain, the senator space and what he calls his toughest primary challenge of his 29 years in the senate, his challenger Kelli Ward who made news recently by saying the 80-year-old senator too old to be re-elected. So, keep an eye on that one.In Florida, we've go two hot races for you, Senator Marco Rubio facing a challenge from a pro-Trump opponent in the primary. It looks like he will win easily but have a close race against the democrats in November. Democrat is likely to be Patrick Murphy. Also in Florida, former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has a very tough primary race for her congressional seat. She was ousted from her DNC chairmanship, if you recall, due to e-mail revelations and she still remains one of the most polarizing political figures not only in the country but within her own party.GUILOYLE: Oh my gosh. OK. Well, thank you so much for that. It almost made me lose my appetite, but nothing can because it's time for ""Kimberly's Food Court"".FRANCIS: I like that.GUILOYLE: All right. So Papa John has done something amazing to size (ph) fantastic delicious pizzas. Yes, you are able to now order a pizza on your iPhone app and they do it with your Papa John account to locate and deliver enjoy your delicious pizza. So, we tried it up. Shall we folks? Feast your eyes on this. There is one production problem here.Sean, my sweet producer, forgot to put my favorite pepperoni or salami on my cheese pizza, but nevertheless, we're going to have some, Melissa. You're interested?FRANCIS: Oh yeah, absolutely.(CROSSTALK)GUILOYLE: I ordered the Domino's on my phone.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: Yeah.GUILOYLE: Well, Steve Ritchie said, you know, say, ""We were attracted to Apple TV because of its commitment to innovation and customer experience."" Two priorities.WILLIAMS: This is not a real story.GUILOYLE: Excuse me. Are you interrupting me while I'm talking about Apple?WILLIAMS: You just wanted to have pizza.GUILOYLE: So what?WILLIAMS: That's OK.GUILOYLE: Everyone knows that already.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: I don't know what show I'm on here. But let's -- it's now ""Special Report"".GUILFOYLE: You're in my ""One More Thing"".FRANCIS: ""Fox and Friends"" afternoon. Take a look at the adorable Violet.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANCIS: She's singing her ABCs like no one has ever builted (ph) them out before for a million views.GUTFELD: Better than Britney. This is better than Britney from VMA.FRANCIS: It's true. She is actually singing. She is adorable. She is from Shreveport, Louisiana. Four million people have watched this video and rightly so. My pizza, I salute you. Adorable.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILOYLE: All right. Fantastic.FRANCIS: We love it.GUILOYLE: So that's going to be for us today. We're going to share our pizza.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.$1.1T SPENDING BILL INCLUDES NEARLY $1B TO HELP ILLEGALS ENTERING U.S.Gary B Smith: First of all this is a program that 20% of Americans favor. Why Obama is doing this, I don't know. Well, I do know. He's trying to get more and more voters into the Democratic Party. There's other tidbits in there. We are providing, you and I, Brenda, American taxpayers $7 million for them to have lawyers so they can fight any immigration case in court. On top of this, let's not forget, most of these people are going to qualify for the earned income tax credit. There is billions upon billions of dollars. The problem is not only will that payment grow with more and more immigrants; it's the most fraudulent program. If there's fraud now, we have all these immigrants come in, that's going to expand probably tenfold. This is a money hole that Obama created and no one wants this.Chuck Rocha: You are talking one-half of one percent of this budget. Just on this specifically, this is adding not only more lawyers, but judges to deal with the influx of these children, mind you, coming across the border. There's going to be a fight on the executive action. They will have the spending run out in February. These were the basic humanitarian needs to move forward.John Layfield: This is politics as usual. Chuck is right. It's a small percentage. The principle is what's important here. Forget about the executive action of whether it was good or bad. The republicans ran on the fact they would not fund a border policy without a policy change. They didn't flip-flop, they lied. They absolutely lied. They rolled over and said hey, we want to go home for Christmas so we are going to pass the bill. We are going to pass this $1.1 Trillion bill, politics as usual. The republicans were given a mandate. They completely broke it. Democrats did the same thing. They passed a bill, business as usual. It shows the hypocrisy in congress and why we can't afford the $1.1 Trillion spending bill.Tracey Byrnes: They caved. I don't know how else to describe it. They completely caved. They come off a victory run and hand it back to the losing team. Why didn't that fight? Let the democrats shut the government down. Do something. Show muscle. They gave in on nothing. One small piece of Dodd-Frank is being deregulated. That is it. They handed a blank slate to the democrats and said do what you want.Jonas Max Ferris: Just because we can afford it doesn't mean we should. This is money that was spent the years before. It went up 10%. They were allocating money for the things in previous years before the president's executive order. As far as, is it good policy going forward, it will increase to Gary's point. There are losers with letting a lot of people get work. There are also some winners. In a perfect situation, we put the resources toward security and jails and all this stuff. Unemployment was high to minimize the labor force. When it's low, lower than today, you want extra workers to come in so they can raise wages and prices. At this point, we could handle a few more immigrants. They are not going to keep flip-flopping because of the recession but that's how it works. PROTESTERS BASHING POLICE NOW TARGETING BUSINESSESJohn Layfield: It's criminal thugs and idiots. Looters loot, not protesters. Dr. King and nelson Mandela believed in peaceful protests. If you have a problem with the grand jury, go after them. Going after apple because they have money so they must be evil is insane. Go after Mayor Michael Bloomberg who's given hundreds of millions of dollars to New York or the rich 1%ers who give hundreds of millions of dollars. They are wanting to cause trouble.Chuck Rocha: I have been going to protests far long time. I am a fan of protests. The American people should rise up and let the government know that. That's what the forefathers said, like John said. Going after private businesses is not the way to do that. Going back to civil rights and union days, you did not go after people because they were economically wealthy. We all aspire to be wealthy and to have justice in the country. There's a right and wrong way to do it.Gary B Smith: I don't understand the effect. They go and close down apple and Marcy's. What effect is that going to have on the police force of New York City? I scratch my head. And what end do they want? Do they want to get rid of capitalism because they think the criminal justice system in communist china is better? It's going to be an upgrade? Start with a core group of people and become something more. ""Hey, we have a protest, let's go to apple."" ""Why are you going?"" ""I don't know it sounds like fun."" It's lunacy.Tracy Byrnes: It is creating havoc. Two weeks before Christmas, it's going to have impacts. Who wants to go shopping at Macy's with this going on?Jonas Max Ferris: You know, they are gaining a lot of attention. Everyone is covering it. The apple store gets more attention than the police station. No one cares about the police station, at the end of the day. The problem is, this isn't about outsourcing or minimum wages. This is about the police in this country and let's keep the focus on that or you will lose the message. Liberals cannot steal this from black America. They have a legitimate point there's no protest in Staten Island where it happened. Then you have the Macy's store. It's not about making stuff in China. Keep it what it was.STUDY: GAS AND OIL PRICES PLUNGE TO 5-YEAR LOWJonas Max Ferris: You don't want too much of a good thing. You don't want oil to go below $50 a barrel. It is systematic of a global recession. It is probably started everywhere except the United States. It's a sign demand is not dropping because we got rid of the clunkers. Let's not hope for $1.50 Gas. That means we are in trouble. We are at a good level now.Chuck Rocha I grew up in east Texas. I'm not your daddy's liberal. We love gas. We love cheap gas. We love cheap gas like a big kid loves cake. We have jobs in the oil industry. I found out a cousin in Texas got laid off because they quit getting oil and gas leases. It's a win and a loss.John Layfield: In November, 40% of oil permits, we were down 40%. States since December, 2007 that have shale drilling have increased their employment by 1.36 Million. State don't are down 432,000. It is a job creator. Overall, the benefit of lower gas prices help the middle class and lower incomes specifically. It is like an economic stimulus.Tracy Byrnes: If you look at your portfolio, odds are good you are at the energy sector. Stuff like this keeps happening. You have to worry about jobs, even a t the companies. What about civil unrest in countries that rely on oil for profit? What about when Venezuela is struggling to begin with. We bring them down further; you have to worry, to Jonas' point, what's going on in the global economy.Gary B Smith: There are two sides to it. It depends. We really don't know the cause. One, you point out that people are getting an average family $1200 extra per year through the gasoline savings. It is not significant. That is a tax cut. Jonas points out it may be indicative of, you know, not enough demand out there. We enter a global recession. That could be the case. We don't know right now if we have too much oil or the demand is too low. Either could push the scale. I happen to side with Jonas. I don't think the low oil price causes the recession, but it's indicative out there that, you know, countries like china and japan and even to a certain extent, the U.S. Aren't having enough demand out there to keep the price up. If it does plummet, maybe it's foreshadowing that we could be in for another rough few years in the economy.STOCK PICKS Gary B Smith: HOLIDAY TIME MEANS MOVIE TIME!

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Eboni Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Oh, boy. On the cusp of Super Tuesday and on the heels of the most intense debate of this election cycle so far, a dramatic new development in the GOP race today. Donald Trump got another big endorsement.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J.: I am proud to be here to endorse Donald Trump for president of the United States. There is no one who is better prepared to provide America with the strong leadership that it needs both at home and around the world than Donald Trump, the best person to beat Hillary Clinton in November. On that stage last night is undoubtedly, Donald Trump. And so I'm thrilled to be here this morning to lend my support.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Chris Christie surprising a lot of folks with his appearance at Trump's news conference in Texas earlier, two weeks after suspending his own campaign for the presidency. You may remember Christie dealt a crushing blow to Marco Rubio on the debate stage right before the New Hampshire primary. Rubio is now being hailed for his performance last night, but Christie's still determined to take him out this time on behalf of Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's an articulate guy. You know Donald probably needs a lifeline after last night. So he called in Chris Christie. I respect that. I have more than my fair share of endorsement.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Rubio reacted to Christie's endorsement earlier.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: He's a conman. I think it's time to unmask him for what he is. He's trying to take over the conservative movement even though he's not a conservative. But more importantly he's a conman. I mean, he is, he's a conman who is taking advantage to people's fears and anxiety about the future, portraying himself as a sort of strong guy. He's not a strong guy. He's never, you know, he's never faced real adversity before.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Trump is saying that politics at this stage of the game is all about momentum and time. The momentum has been in the Trump camp and time is running out for Rubio and Cruz. Some are saying Rubio's debate performance last night was a momentum changer that is until a Christie endorsement today. Trump has once again taken hold of the news cycle, the Christie endorsement, that is. And that, with that wild campaign event may have just shut the front door on some of his competitors. That, of course, is my opinion. Now Marco Rubio will be on Special Report tonight to respond to this. But KG, Rubio had a nice debate performance last night. And then this afternoon, all of a sudden big endorsement, I mean big in the sense of momentous.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah. And Rubio was so smiling and happy last night. He looked like he's like just won the Super Bowl and said he's on the way to, you know, Disneyland or Disneyworld. He had a great night. But again, if the people wanted to try and take on Donald Trump, like why are you showing up in the ninth inning? You should have been playing ball all along. You had of research against him. Why didn't you bring out things before? It's all a little bit suspect. Nevertheless, he was taking heavy hits, from the left, from the right, all over the place and he was fending (ph) them off. He was fending (ph) them off. He was like doing like Jedi moves try to, you know, deflect away from it, slamming this one then slamming that one. It was a little bit crazy. Now Chris Wallace described it as like a demolition derby, but not necessarily anybody up there acting like, you know, becoming to the office of the presidency. But Greg, you even said it went by so fast. You barely like, boom.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: It was over.GUILFOYLE: Three hours have been quick.GUTFELD: It is three hours. It was fast. I thought that, I thought Rubio did a great job. However, like you said, it should have happened sooner, but the problem is you had 17, you had 17 candidates. So you had slivers of character rather than the full character. And then you have a brilliant move by Trump, which is basically, he's like a quick thinking carjacker, you know? He said -- you saw what happened last night. He, you know, lost it a little on Twitter but then he came through with this thing. And by the way, we are complicit. I mean, the lead is Christie, if the lead is -- and also Christie is now trending on Twitter, not Rubio. So this all worked out really well. You know Trump reminds me of? He's the political version of ""Deadpool."" You know ""Deadpool."" ""Deadpool"" is the superhero that has these regenerative powers. No matter what you do, it just heals immediately. He really is ""Deadpool."" And he still, you know, he's a smart ass, but he -- nothing seems to hurt him.EBONI WILLIAMS, GUEST CO-HOST: He's kind of like in trial, right? Where it's like you know you have such a losing case, so as a defense you just throw everything against the wall just to see if anything will stick. I kind of like that's where these candidates are. KG is so right. It's so little, so late in the game.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, weird.WILLIAMS: You just have to question how much is going to have to even stick. I mean, we're not talking about Marco Rubio.BOLLING: But Dana, talk a little bit about the Christie endorsement. It came as a surprise. Especially a lot of people would think that a Christie type would back Marco Rubio, no?GUILFOYLE: Dana, you called it this morning before it happened.PERINO: Thank you very much, KG. I'm reading her e-mails this morning.GUILFOYLE: You know it --GUTFELD: At 6:00 a.m.PERINO: OK, you know --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: You know my theory about endorsements, add not subtract where you can. I think this is important especially from a news perspective. I don't know how much votes it brings along with you. I mean, Christie came in dead last in Iowa. He has a lot of fans and a lot of supporters, but it's a narrow slice. I actually think that in some ways it felt a little awkward to me watching it because just a couple a few weeks ago, Chris Christie in that last debate said, ""A vote for Trump is a vote for Hillary Clinton."" And Donald Trump said about Bridgegate, he said, ""Chris Christie knew about it all along."" So that -- this happens in politics where then you have an unholy alliance and they come together. I think Biden and Obama, right? They were competitors and then they come, come together. Christie always said that he would support the eventual nominee. There are some people with some very strong feelings that this is a negative for Chris Christie, and you can read all about them on the Twitter.GUTFELD: But also, I mean, this does explain why Christie took out Rubio's legs in the previous debate. They're like, let's face it, Trump is known for one thing -- making deals. And he clearly made a deal with Christie. I think he made a deal with Kasich as well, because Kasich was very helpful to Trump last night. So we're watching the kind of the cabinet take shape.PERINO: Do you think.GUTFELD: And remember --PERINO: . Trump made a deal with Kasich?GUTFELD: Oh, I think so, but -- I don't know.BOLLING: But Chris Christie --GUILFOYLE: That was after his third glass of Pinot Noir, Pinot Noir of the night.BOLLING: You're not gonna --GUILFOYLE: He's like, oh I see deals.BOLLING: You're not gonna say Christie is the transportation secretary by general?GUILFOYLE: No.GUTFELD: No.GUILFOYLE: Attorney general.GUTFELD: I think Christie is the attorney general.GUILFOYLE: Attorney general.GUTFELD: Attorney general --BOLLING: I'm kidding.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: We've a learned a lot about bridges.GUTFELD: But by the way, they are both on the opposite side of entitlement reform. So how does that, you know, does that matter?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Well, also, can I mention one -- this one other thing on the --BOLLING: Yeah.PERINO: On the endorsement? So, throughout the campaign, people that mistakenly thought that Donald Trump wouldn't stay -- go the distance, that Chris Christie would pick up his supporters, because if you like someone who tells it like it is then Chris Christie was that kind of person. So -- and to me, this isn't all that surprising. What would be really surprising, which would be great for Donald Trump, if he could pull it off, is to get somebody like a Governor Scott Walker, right, somebody who would be different so that you're adding a whole different dimension and you're growing your audience.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Are you going to call that?PERINO: No.GUILFOYLE: OK. I'll check my e-mail in the morning -- yeah.BOLLING: KG, you've known Chris Christie for a long time. You know Trump for a long time. If Trump wants to be -- maybe wants to pivot to be a little bit more statesman-like, he can use Chris Christie to be more Trump- like who would give -- the guy clearly was the biggest --GUILFOYLE: Here -- yeah.BOLLING: . loudest voice in the room for a long time (inaudible).GUILFOYLE: Trump likes his style, too. And he said, ""I was a master for prosecution,"" what he did to Rubio. These two fit together well in terms of they are kind of simpatico and the way they go after. And if you are going to come after them, they'll gonna hit you twice as hard, so similar type of personality. He's was able to make the case for Trump to say, ""Yeah, he's the only guy that knows how to, you know, hire people, has executive level experience like myself, et cetera."" I thought Christie did a very good job today doing what he needed and wanted to do, and I know a lot of his supporters are also --GUTFELD: Well, conservatives.GUILFOYLE: Supporting Trump.GUTFELD: . remember Christie hugging Obama now.PERINO: Not anymore.GUTFELD: Not anymore. He'll be one of those things that float away to the (inaudible).GUILFOYLE: About last night.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: Let me get to this one. This endorsement comes after a heated debate last night where Trump and Rubio shared many harsh words. Rubio especially tried hard to get under Trump's skin.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens and thousands --RUBIO: Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.TRUMP: Just be quiet. Just be quiet. Let me talk. This is a world that's going to work.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: If he builds the wall, the way he builds Trump tower, he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Here's a guy that buys a house for a hundred and seventy-nine thousands. He sells it to a lobbyist, who is probably here, for $380,000 and then legislation is passed. This is what we're going to have a president.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Here's a guy that inherited at $200 million. If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be now?TRUMP: No, no, no, no.RUBIO: Selling watches in Manhattan.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: He lied, 100 percent, a hundred percent.RUBIO: You lied about the polish workers.TRUMP: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah -- 38 years ago.RUBIO: You lied to the students at Trump University.TRUMP: Thirty -eight years ago.MARIA CELESTE ARRARAS, TELEMUNDO CO-ANCHOR: Let Senator Cruz jump in.RUBIO: He lied 38 years ago. All right, I guess there's a statute of limitations on lies.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Ebony, that was.WILLIAMS: That was--BOLLING: . unbelievable last night.WILLIAMS: That's like the real housewives of the District of Columbia.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, right.WILLIAMS: I swear to you. It really is. It's amazing political. But at this point in the game we kind of expect this, right? We're post South Carolina. The gloves have officially come off. I can't even be mad at Marco Rubio for throwing everything and seeing what's sticking some of that did. Most of it I think slid off and certainly. You know, but look, we know that Trump takes this stuff, I think a little personally. I don't think he was happy at all with what happened last night. And that's why he came out swinging big time today.BOLLING: Can I throw out something here? The numbers, poll numbers out today. Virginia, Trump plus 23; Florida, Trump plus 20; Michigan, plus 24 Trump; Massachusetts, plus 21. Yesterday, Texas, Trump even on one point --GUILFOYLE: He brought that up there.BOLLING: What they needed was a change of momentum last night. They started to get it. And it feels like -- I don't know.GUILFOYLE: They had it.BOLLING: It's back in the Trump camp --GUTFELD: Well that goes back to what I said about him being the political version of Deadpool. You know, when you saw Trump last night talk about Planned Parenthood, in the old days that would have hurt any republican candidate to come out strongly on Planned Parenthood, but the primary charm of Trump is exactly what a lot of his ardent supporters fail to see. He has no track with ideology. He is not going up against the establishment. He's going up against the duopoly of right versus left. He hasn't have any --GUILFOYLE: Good word.GUTFELD: Duopoly.GUILFOYLE: Duopoly.GUTFELD: He has no --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: No, he's apolitical, he's neither right nor left, he's not ideological. And that's his charm, but it's also could be his criticism. I think Rubio tried to go after that. But it doesn't matter to his fans because his fans are new to this game.WILLIAMS: That's right. And also, I think this. I think this -- he's not a real conservative that Rubio and Cruz. He's trying to (inaudible). I don't think people care because people feel like this. They'd rather take a chance with Trump, even though they maybe don't know for sure what they're going to get. That feels better to a lot of people than going with what they already know hasn't worked before. I think that's --BOLLING: Dana, a lot of people has said, you know, whisper. I like Trump. But they whisper. They won't say it out loud but they whisper --PERINO: Really?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: It's not 40,000 people at his rally.BOLLING: No, no, no. And if you asked a lot of people --GUILFOYLE: That's like shouting.BOLLING: But now, we had a couple of congressmen are out and endorse him. Now you have -- wasn't Christie the chairman of the Republican Governors Association.GUILFOYLE: Governors Association.PERINO: Right. Which is why I think also, I mean, I'm not, not to take away from the endorsement, like adding is better than subtracting. But there are -- believe me, there are conservatives all across the country, republicans, not even of the establishment ilk who are looking at this going it doesn't matter to them or they think that Chris Christie sold out. I do think that Chris Christie deserves so much credit for -- look at across the country the number of republican governors, it's just amazing. He worked his tail off for that.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: And deserves a lot of credit for it. I also think that if you look at someone today, like in Oklahoma, one of the states that will be -- have a vote on Tuesday -- Super Tuesday. You have Senator Inhofe who is introducing Marco Rubio. Senator Inhofe is certainly no shrinking violet when it comes to conservative movement. So there are endorsements on the other side on -- for other candidates. And we haven't even talked about Senator Cruz yet. And I know we have another block and we'll hopefully get to it. I thought he had a decent debate, too.WILLIAMS: I don't think about he was talking about him -- even though today Dana, because again, it's just, it kind of -- this is where Rubio, I think was successful, right? He's kind of limiting the conversation to Trump/Rubio which is at least helpful for him.BOLLING: Which is a problem for Ted Cruz because.WILLIAMS: I think so.BOLLING: . Ted Cruz needs Texas.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: . on Super Tuesday.WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: Remember, if he doesn't get 50 percent of the vote, that goes straight proportional.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: Which means, Ted Cruz, it could -- it maybe, that maybe the (inaudible).WILLIAMS: And that weakens his argument too, Eric, that he -- be the guy that can win.BOLLING: All you Cruz-ettes (ph).WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: . please don't yell at me. I'm just doing math.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: It's just by the math.WILLIAMS: It's all good, Eric. No, no, but it's true. Because right now Cruz gets to say, look I'm the one person still standing that has beaten Donald Trump. And that's a stronger argument if he wins Texas. If he loses Texas, that argument loses team --GUTFELD: Could -- can I -- look, can we -- the thing about Rubio, he went from C-3PO to the Karate Kid. That is what he needed to do.GUILFOYLE: Ralph Macchio.GUTFELD: But what about the two? There are people we haven't talked about, Carson and Kasich. And I felt when I was watching the debate, those were like the slow parts in action movies, you know. When you get up and you get something to drink or go to the men's room, you know, because there was just nothing happening. And I think --PERINO: The romance scene.GUTFELD: Yeah the romance -- it's been -- yeah. There were the romantic scenes in action films when Mel Gibson talks to his kid.GUILFOYLE: That's not romantic.BOLLING: Ben Carson --GUILFOYLE: . when you talk to the kid. Oh, wow.BOLLING: Ben Carson had the best line of the night.GUTFELD: Oh, he did. Yeah, why --BOLLING: Can some please --GUTFELD: Can someone attack me.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: We'll gonna leave right there.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Catch Marco Rubio on Special Report tonight at 6:00 p.m. eastern for more on his reaction to the Christie endorsement of Trump, and a lots more on last night's debate coming right up.And later, it's Facebook Friday. Post your questions for us now at facebook.com/thefivefnc -- back in a couple of minutes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: I wasn't just Trump versus Rubio last night. Senator Cruz also tried to take down the front-runner. Here's Cruz hitting Trump for his position on health care.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TED CRUZ, TEXAS SENATOR: Donald, true or false, you said the government should pay for everyone's health care.TRUMP: That's false.CRUZ: You've never said that.TRUMP: No, I've never -- I said it worked in a couple of countries, but I never said --CRUZ: But when you, you never stood on this debate stage and said it works great in Canada and Scotland.TRUMP: No, I did not.CRUZ: . we should do it here. Did you say.TRUMP: No, I did not.CRUZ: . if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care you have no heart.TRUMP: Correct.CRUZ: Did you say you're a liberal on health care?TRUMP: I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.CRUZ: Have you said you're a liberal on health care?TRUMP: Excuse me, Let me talk. If people --CRUZ: Explain your plan, please.TRUMP: My plan is very simple. I will not -- we're going to have private -- we are going to have private health care.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: That was really the first time that we had a chance to see -- to really see a candidate drill down, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: . on health care. And I think that Obamacare is actually, still, this like dark cloud that hangs over the country. And I thought that was useful. I thought that Donald Trump's answer about -- ""I'm not going to let anybody die in the streets"" was a very good one. I also that ted Cruz has some good points, if you follow this closely in terms of like Scotland and Canada, 20 weeks to see a specialist is not so great.GUILFOYLE: No, absolutely. And this is an important issue. And like Obamacare is like that rash that keeps coming back. Greg, you can relate.GUTFELD: I know.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Thank you for bringing that up.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: By the way, where did I get it from, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Bolling.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: All right.GUILFOYLE: Whoa.BOLLING: The gloves off.GUILFOYLE: Gloves are off.GUTFELD: Well, that's how it happened.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Where were we?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I don't think -- I'll go to you. Do you want to follow up on that?WILLIAMS: I'll try my best to follow up, Dana. I --GUILFOYLE: A bunch of counterpunchers.WILLIAMS: . do not like --(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: I think, I think KG is right. I think the substance of this kind of health care thing, kind of exposing a more liberal position on Trump's part smart by Cruz. I don't think the style looks good that way. It's kind of looks like badgering the witness to me. You know, he's kind of like poking and poking. It's all like, hey, you know, literally - look at his posture.PERINO: But Trump can't win.WILLIAMS: . you know.PERINO: The other day you're like, go after him. Now, today it's like.WILLIAMS: No, it's like --PERINO: . you go after him.WILLIAMS: It's just I think, you know, you just have to be careful with the style. I think --PERINO: I agree. No, I agree.WILLIAMS: A little more reserved, kind of unsuspectingly. It would have been more effective than it even was.GUTFELD: But do you think the Democratic Party is going to treat the republican.WILLIAMS: No.GUTFELD: . front-runner any less? I think any time somebody goes after somebody, they are doing them a huge favor.WILLIAMS: Sure.GUTFELD: Because imagine Hillary. Like Hillary is going to look at all the things from -- the stuff that you heard whether it is business practices or being mean to, mean to Hispanics or mean to Muslims, there's underlying aggression.WILLIAMS: Reaction to women.GUTFELD: Yeah. They're going to go after this. The protectionism in terrorist, you got -- he's got to get prepared for this sort of thing.WILLIAMS: But then he gets his --BOLLING: Right.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Yeah, right. They got to do it. So I'm certainly not criticizing Cruz for going there. You got to go there. He should have went there like KG said a long time ago. It's just --PERINO: Let's get Eric in here.BOLLING: So -- in yesterday, we talked about this, what it's going to be, and he said, there's gonna be (inaudible) I think. No, Trump was smart. He's got these leads. You want to pad the lead, coast in, and then you see the clubhouse. I'll just gonna light it up and put it out and win this tournament. Cruz and Rubio went at him. And he beat -- and he fought back. And I'm like, what is he doing? At the end you go, you know that's Donald Trump, though. That's him --GUILFOYLE: You were saying that last night.BOLLING: Yeah --GUILFOYLE: I was like, what do you mean? He's got to respond back.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And to be honest with you, at the end, yup, they got shots in on him, but he got shots back in, and it seemed to play into the narrative of him being just saying stuff and putting it out there and people liking what he's saying.PERINO: Some people.BOLLING: It worked from somehow.PERINO: Yeah, sure.BOLLING: Right, yeah.PERINO: All right, Trump still had to release his tax return, as a subject last night. He says he can't yet. It's a subject he was pressed on again last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HUGH HEWITT, RADIO HOST: A year ago you told me on my radio show the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube -- that you would release your tax returns.TRUMP: True.HEWITT: Are you going back on your --(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: First of all, very few people listen to your radio show. That's the good news. Let's me just tell you.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Let me just -- which happens to be true. Check out the ratings. I want to release my tax returns, but I can't release it while I'm under an audit. We're under a routine audit. I've had it for years, I get audited. And obviously, if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I don't blame him for saying that he can't do that. But the IRS apparently, Kimberly, says that he's allowed to.GUILFOYLE: Well, he's allowed to, but then, nevertheless, under the advice of counsel you would be told.PERINO: Right.GUILFOYLE: . and by your account and to not use that. Greta made that point earlier, talking about that thing. Look, I don't blame him. I wouldn't tell him -- if I was representing him, I would say don't, wait, stand down. Now, once that's cleared up, who knows how long it's gonna take to do that. Then, you can proceed, but it is not advisable.PERINO: All right. What do you think, Ebony, on tax returns?WILLIAMS: I actually think this is ones that should be little vulnerable. Not just around the releasing of the tax return that will probably play OK, but if there's, you know, as Romney saying, some big bombshell. I don't think is. But if there were to be, I do think that, that his financial success is a big part of his power play. And if there are any questions around that that are valid, there's maybe an opportunity for vulnerability.PERINO: All right, we're gonna have to go. Next, pressure is mounting on Hillary Clinton to release the transcript of her big money speeches to Wall Street, but she is pushing back again, her excuse now when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: That's how we do it. Tomorrow is decision day. Once again in South Carolina, democrats hold their primary this time. Hillary Clinton has a commanding lead, but today she's facing more heat over her big money speeches to Wall Street. ""The New York Times"" endorsed Clinton last month, but now it's demanding she turn over those transcripts, saying voters have a right to know what she said to financial groups. Bernie Sanders thinks so, too.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BERNIE SANDERS, VERMONT SENATOR: It might be a good idea to release the transcript of what you said to Wall Street, you know. Maybe what you said behind closed doors is a little bit different than what you're saying to the American people. I would hope that she will do that. Secretary Clinton said, well, she will do it if other people do it. I am prepared to release all of the transcripts I got for secret meetings in Wall Street. Here they are.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: That means zero. Hillary insists she's been transparent, has nothing hide.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: People can go back. They can look at what I said and what I did when I was a senator. I'm the one who called out Wall Street. I actually went to Wall Street in '07. I said you guys are going to wreck the economy. And I went after hedge funds loopholes.MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC ""MORNING JOE"" CO-HOST: Can you assure the American people that you didn't say anything in those speeches that would undermine your promise.CLINTON: Absolutely.BRZEZINSKI: . to be tough on Wall Street.CLINTON: Absolutely.BRZEZINSKI: And the big banks.CLINTON: Absolutely. And besides, I'm on the public record. I've told them what I'm going to do. I've said I'm gonna go after big banks that pose a systemic risk. I want you to hold me accountable for that because I will do that exactly.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: But I want you to show me the money in the meantime, mm-mm. Donations, right, Dana? I mean, come on.PERINO: I -- I would be -- I don't know who has transcripts of their speeches. I mean, I thought Donald Trump had a good point. It's like, I'll give you transcripts. It's like, I don't -- he just speaks off the cuff. And I don't know if anybody -- you guys give speeches like I never get a transcript. I mean maybe it's recorded at some point.BOLLING: It's not our private server.PERINO: Or maybe she does, I guess. I mean, I don't understand. I do think that calls -- Bernie Sanders, finally it's like feeling like, oh. Maybe this is something I can attack her on. It's a little -- talk about being a little late to the party. That is one. I don't know if the transcripts will be forthcoming. I do know this. Wall Street doesn't care what Hillary Clinton said behind closed doors or what she says now, because they know if she's going to -- if she became president, she would do exactly what they wanted.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. Like, it's in the bag.WILLIAMS: Yes. She's definitely for them.This is puzzling to me for Hillary Clinton, because to me, this is actually an opportunity. Right? She knows she has, like, these really low poll numbers around trustworthiness. So how about just this one time -- I don't say always do what the public asks. But maybe once say, ""You know what? Don't take my word for it. I'm going to prove it to you that I'm being consistent both in front of Wall Street and behind closed doors."" I think it's actually a missed opportunity.BOLLING: She can't. She can't do it.WILLIAMS: What are you saying?BOLLING: Here's what I'm saying. First of all, I think she's going to be the nominee. I agree with Dana. I don't think what's on those transcripts is going to change the election whatsoever. It's important that The New York Times is calling for the transcripts, as well.But I will tell you, the reason why she can't do it is because I will almost guarantee -- in fact, I'll bet $10,000 to a charity, I'll give it to -- if there is anywhere in any of her transcripts to -- in a speech to anyone on Wall Street saying, ""You guys are going to undermine the economy."" I will -- $10,000 to a charity if she produces a transcript that says that to a Wall Street bank.You know why? Because when you go do a speech in front of someone, you tell them what they want to hear. And they're going to pay you 2, 3, $400,000 to do your speech, you're not going to tell them they're going to undermine the economy. It's just not going to happen.GUILFOYLE: And at this point, then she plays the gender card, throwing down an ""X"" on the spot. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, it is painful. It's hurtful to have people say, ""Oh, we don't trust her. Don't know why she's doing it."" And it totally struck me, you know, maybe there is this underlying question like, ""Is she doing it for herself or is she really in it for us?""And I've always thought of myself as being service-oriented.Still today, when you are a high-achieving woman, particularly one in the public eye, you really are just expected to perform at a higher level all the time.Men, my goodness, you know, there's a million different ways you can be successful, you can communicate, and all the rest of it.I am not a natural politician like...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right, right.CLINTON: ... Mr. Clinton or Barack Obama, and so for me it really came through the route of service.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right, ""X"" chromosome. Did it help her, hurt her?GUTFELD: She was service-oriented. Her husband was serviced-oriented. And whether it's e-mails or transcripts...GUILFOYLE: Look away. Don't look at him. Don't make eye contact.GUTFELD: Whether it's e-mails or transcripts, nothing good ever comes from releasing something. Just ask Bill.Remember his whole problem with the tax return? The tax returns that had the charitable clothes? That's what I'm talking about. Get your minds out of the gutter.You know what's funny is her gender could have actually -- you could argue the opposite, that her gender helps her; that if she were a male, they would trust her less. So there's no evidence here.GUILFOYLE: How can you be less trustworthy in the polls than she is right now? I mean, that's like Benghazi...GUTFELD: I was saying if she were a man, perhaps.GUILFOYLE: I don't know.GUTFELD: It's a hypothetical. It's not true.GUILFOYLE: Oh, sorry. I was looking for fact-based.All right. Dana Perino.PERINO: I just wish that I knew her better so I could understand how best maybe I could, if I were a communications person advising her, I could say that she could answer this. Because I know how I would probably answer it.But I feel like she's constantly searching for a way to convince people that she's trustworthy, and each time it's like going backwards.However, on her point about women having to perform better at higher levels of an organization, if you look at her target market of the people who are likely to come out and vote for her, there's a strong possibility that that is persuasive to them. And especially for single women. When Bernie Sanders is no longer in the running, they might not be as enthusiastic for her. But that's going to speak to them.So I think she's laying the groundwork for a very important demographic that will be important to her in the general election.GUILFOYLE: All right. Time for tease. Anybody? Good. Don't move, because ""Facebook Friday's"" up next, with Rash Boy.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: For all you ranch hands out there. No, ""Big Valley."" I believe that was ""Big Valley,"" my nickname in high school.All right. This is from Eileen. We're doing ""Facebook Friday."" Start with you, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Oh, great.GUTFELD: ""If you could challenge any of the candidates to a game of truth or dare, which one would it be, why, and what would your dare to them be?"" Keep it clean. I've already...GUILFOYLE: They're in my ear so much going ""P.G., P.G."" I'm like, who? Who is that? Like, ""P.G.""GUTFELD: What does P.G. stand for?GUILFOYLE: They're saying, ""P.G., keep it P.G.""No, I was like, I'd rather do Twister.BOLLING: Dude. That could have been your funniest joke ever.GUILFOYLE: Of all time.PERINO: I missed it?BOLLING: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Yes.So who would I want to do truth or -- wait, Truth or Dare with?GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: No, no, no, no, no. That's not an appropriate game to play with someone you're covering in an election.PERINO: I have never played that game.GUTFELD: Neither have I.GUILFOYLE: Isn't it truth or dare, then you have to kiss them? Who came up with that?GUTFELD: No, no, no. You -- you ask them to tell you something, and if they don't tell you something, then you dare them. See, I think I'd solve the problem by going to Hillary and dare her to tell the truth.We'll be right back.GUILFOYLE: Maybe it's a different game that I knew of.GUTFELD: All right, Eboni, save this terrible question.WILLIAMS: You took my -- I was going to dare her to tell the truth. But here's the other thing. I would pick Hillary Clinton, and I would dare her to let me style her for the rest of the campaign.GUILFOYLE: You would dare her to tell the truth, too.WILLIAMS: Yes. But I would actually really like to get my hands on her, and you know, she could do much, much better than she does.GUTFELD: Eric.PERINO: I think she looks pretty good.BOLLING: Interesting.I would dare Hillary as well, but I'd dare her to come on FOX News and do a sit-down, fair and balanced interview.GUTFELD: Oooh! That's good. That's a good one. Never happen. But you know.GUILFOYLE: Dream on.BOLLING: It's good to dream.PERINO: I don't know.GUTFELD: How about this? Dare Donald Trump not to be on Twitter for three days?PERINO: I'd like to dare myself that.GUTFELD: That was the -- yes.PERINO: I would love to not get on Twitter.GUILFOYLE: He'd definitely be the most fun to play with.GUTFELD: Yes, but, yes, my goodness, where that would end up.All right. Chris, this question is, ""If you could be on the next POTUS cabinet, which role would you want?"" Let's go this way.PERINO: Oh, wow. That's a great question. I -- you know what?GUTFELD: You already had one.PERINO: I've got one. Department of Interior.GUTFELD: That's not fair!PERINO: Why?GUTFELD: Because that was my choice.PERINO: Department of Interior. You get all the national parks.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And you also could help restore balance to federal land use and for coal country.GUTFELD: See, I would just like to tell everybody that I'm a park ranger.PERINO: You want an outfit?GUTFELD: Yes, I want an outfit, I'd wear it every day.PERINO: Could the park police please send him one of those green outfits?GUTFELD: Yes, I will wear it to work every day -- Eric.BOLLING: So Nate Fredman (ph) tells me the best job to have in a cabinet would be the treasury secretary, because you're so close to the president. Is that accurate?PERINO: You're right next door.BOLLING: Right next door. That's what I hear. So maybe that would be the one.GUTFELD: Hm. Eboni.WILLIAMS: I like it. Secretary of education.GUTFELD: Why, because you're not doing it (ph)?PERINO: Why am I getting the sad face?WILLIAMS: No. Because it's near and dear to my heart. You're a hot -- a hot mess, Greg. No, no, no, I think it's the great equalizer. And, you know, I want to take my -- I think I could save America's kids.BOLLING: That is liberal.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: National security adviser. I want to be in charge of ISIS.GUTFELD: Yes. There you go.GUILFOYLE: And I wouldn't even sleep. And I would just...BOLLING: They might give up. If you were appointed, they might say, ""You know what? We're done here.""GUTFELD: You would do, like, the recruitment videos. And they'd go, ""Why are we over here? Let's go over there.""PERINO: Come to the bright side.GUTFELD: Seventy-two virgins has nothing on Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Greater than.GUTFELD: So you took mine, so I'm going to go with secretary of agriculture, because I'd love to grow.Laraine...GUILFOYLE: This is not a good...GUTFELD: This is fun. I love this segment. All right, starting with you, Eric, from Laraine M., ""How will this election be depicted in the history books?""BOLLING: I think it will be momentous sea change. I think American politics is changed forever, thanks to what's going on. Donald Trump brought it. Everyone's playing. As you can see last night, Rubio, Cruz, they were all brawling it out. You remember...GUTFELD: Is that a positive?BOLLING: I think -- I like it. I personally like it. I also like in Parliament, you know how they yell at each other? They yell and they debate...GUTFELD: The band?BOLLING: No, no, no, in the British Parliament.PERINO: But they don't, like, speak over each other.BOLLING: Sometimes they do.GUTFELD: They're pretty -- they do -- they insult each other, which is fine.PERINO (IN BRITISH ACCENT): Prime minister's question hour. Sounds like the one you're talking about.GUTFELD: And then they, ""Oh, oh. Oh!"" That's what they do.GUILFOYLE: OK, wow.GUTFELD: They do that.GUILFOYLE: Skip to the next question, please. The about how many drinks...PERINO: Yes.GUILFOYLE: ... so I can answer yours.GUTFELD: No, you can't skip it.GUILFOYLE: But this is taking too long.PERINO: You don't get through all the questions.GUILFOYLE: Yes. He's just like, ""Fire it up.""GUTFELD: you know what? We are done.PERINO: No, we have one more question.GUTFELD: No, we have one more, one more. This is from Kevin. I'll start with you, Eboni. ""How many drinks did you have...""GUILFOYLE: I told you, I just did that one.GUTFELD: How many drinks did you have while watching the debate? Now what's wrong now, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: No, it's good. This is the one I said we should get to.WILLIAMS: I had two. I had a beer and a margarita.PERINO: Wow, mixing.GUTFELD: You get a little -- I bet you get buzzed. You're light. You get buzzed.WILLIAMS: I know. I have a two -- I have learned over time I have a two- drink max.GUTFELD: Wow.WILLIAMS: Unless I'm like really...GUTFELD: I was like 4 when I had a two-drink max.Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: So one.GUTFELD: One? You just had one. Why did it take so long?GUILFOYLE: Well, because I was thinking about the potato chips and all the other stuff that I ate and sushi and the -- yes.GUTFELD: Somebody hanging out at Walgreen's.Eric.BOLLING: I had zero, because I did the ""Hannity"" midnight thing, and so there was a lot of tempting ideas to run across the street to Del Frisco's and have a drink or two. I heard you were there.WILLIAMS: I was.BOLLING: I got reports back. But I stayed in my office, and I watched the whole debate.GUTFELD: Yes, you can't do -- you cannot do ""Hannity"" drunk.PERINO: I have drank less since these elections started than in a long time. Because I got the honor to be on the special election coverage focus team. I guess we can call it a team.WILLIAMS: The A-Team.PERINO: So you don't drink before you go on television, right?GUTFELD: Yes, well, it depends what show it is.PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: ""FOX & Friends"" -- ""FOX & Friends,"" I'm hammered. I'm just coming in.PERINO: Before you go to sleep?GUTFELD: I'm just coming in.GUILFOYLE: That's why he's -- nothing.GUTFELD: No, I'm joking. I've never done that.I had three glasses of delightful pinot.GUILFOYLE: And you were screaming at the TV.GUTFELD: Yes, screaming at the TV.WILLIAMS: Pinot Noir or Grigio?GUILFOYLE: Peanut of the night.GUILFOYLE: No Grigio for me. I'm a man.WILLIAMS: The night, you just said it.GUILFOYLE: Barely.GUTFELD: A plate of ribs.PERINO: I can't see the Pinot. That's not manly.GUTFELD: I'm sorry, you know what? Maybe I'm man enough to have a pinot, all right?PERINO: OK.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.BOLLING: That finger was...GUTFELD: I said pinot.BOLLING: The finger is hovering over the bleep button.GUILFOYLE: Please, please.GUTFELD: You always say that. And I always do, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Oh, God.GUTFELD: All right. Al Sharpton, remember him? He doesn't want Trump to be president, but he just gave Americans the best incentive there is to elect him when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Did Al Sharpton just seal the deal for the Donald? Some of my colleagues here at ""The Five"" thinks that he did. He said that he's given the GOP an amazing get-out-the-vote strategy with his new threat to leave America if Trump wins.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AL SHARPTON, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: If Donald Trump is the nominee, I'm open to support anyone while I'm also reserving my -- my ticket to get out of here if he wins. Only because he'd probably have me deported anyway.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Wow. OK. ""The View"" co-host Raven-Symone says she will leave the country, as well, but she'll leave if any of the five Republicans are even nominated.OK, so I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt here. Right?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAVEN-SYMONE, CO-HOST, ABC'S ""THE VIEW"": I'm going to move to Canada with my entire family.JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, ABC'S ""THE VIEW"": Are you really?SYMONE: I already have my ticket.BEHAR: Really?SYMONE: No, I literally bought my ticket.BEHAR: You're not a citizen, you know, of Canada.SYMONE: That's OK. I'll make it. I'll make it. I'll figure that out.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: OK, I want to give her the benefit of the doubt here. She said even if they're nominated. We think that she means elected, because obviously one of them will be nominated.GUTFELD: She's stupid.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: Can we just get this right out now? She didn't -- she's getting political analysis from ""The View"" is like getting recipes from ""The Walking Dead.""And by the way, if Al Sharpton is leaving, maybe he'd go where Tawana Brawley went.GUILFOYLE: Ew. Body slam.GUTFELD: What do you mean, ew?WILLIAMS: Ew, bringing up old stuff, Greg.GUTFELD: It's real stuff.WILLIAMS: I hear you.GUTFELD: There's no statute of limitations for hoaxes.WILLIAMS: No limitations on shade, clearly.That's funny.GUILFOYLE: Bye, Al.WILLIAMS: Mobilizing, like as if, like, GOP turnout needed more motivation, certainly.PERINO: This is -- this is the kind of thing that both parties say in the lead-up to an election, like ""If Obama win, I'm leaving."" ""If President Bush wins, I'm moving to Paris."" Johnny Depp, I think, actually did.But when she says, ""No, I literally bought my ticket."" I think if I were Donald Trump and is they were giving him a hard time, the next time they ask for his tax returns, he's like, ""Show me that ticket.""GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ""Show me that ticket that you literally bought."" Because obviously...GUTFELD: You think she knows what literally means, like it would be figuratively?PERINO: Not figuratively? Or ironic?GUTFELD: Sometimes, people get it -- yes.WILLIAMS: Well, that's also weird, right? Like, why is Sharpton talking about being deported? Like...PERINO: Well, what...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: He's trying to be funny. Funny, but...GUILFOYLE: Maybe because he didn't pay the taxes.BOLLING: But I would definitely cut that sound bite and use that as a campaign. I would use that as a super PAC, use it to raise some votes.I thought it was -- Raven-Symone, is that her name?WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: Isn't she conservative? She was on the side of some conservative cause recently, no? Am I wrong?PERINO: Don't know.GUTFELD: She made fun of someone about their name, remember that?WILLIAMS: That's true. And Ann Coulter came for her on ""The View,"" which was a weird thing where, like, all these liberals were actually cheering for Ann Coulter for once.It's -- I think Raven is very new to politics, Eric.BOLLING: Oh, yes. Clearly.WILLIAMS: Clearly.BOLLING: Any Republican nominated.PERINO: Well, there's a lot of interest, and a lot -- People feel passionate. So you would say, ""I'm going to leave your country."" But you know what? America is going to be great, no matter what.GUILFOYLE: Well, because he'll have to pay taxes if he stays here.BOLLING: Now, very well. Good job.GUILFOYLE: New president in the White House. Show us the money, Al.GUTFELD: Candidates should build a wall so Americans can't move after Trump's elected.BOLLING: And we'll pay for it.GUTFELD: And we'll pay for it.WILLIAMS: A lot of people say it's so stupid.""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Wow. Wow. All right. Time for ""One More Thing."" I'm going to go first.Don't forget, Sunday we're all going to come back. We're going to be here for a special edition of ""The Five"" live at 5. We're going to preview the big Super Tuesday, coming up in just a couple of days from there.All right. K.G., you're up.GUILFOYLE: I have been looking forward to this. And welcome to Kimberly's Food Court. That's how we do it, yes. Yes. You need your hand, you can use a fork.GUTFELD: Show the food!GUILFOYLE: Here today, I-HOP. Lower it. There we go. I-HOP is the originator of the all-day breakfast. Nothing frustrates me more when you miss it by five minutes. And you're like, ""No, I know you have the ingredients, just let me back there."" But they're the ones who started it. Everybody else has been trying to copy it.A year ago, they introduced these fabulous dishes. And take a look on here. It's Blackberry and Vanilla Double-Dipped Brioche French Toast, and -- Elvis would love this -- Banana, Peanut Butter and Chocolate French Toast. And this is so...GUTFELD: Look how that turned out for him.GUTFELD: In corn flakes. This could have saved him, if he ate it.I highly encourage you to stop by.PERINO: The dipped in corn flakes is what sells that.GUTFELD: That's amazing.GUILFOYLE: You can see them on here. I mean, Eboni, does this not look delicious?WILLIAMS: The texture.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. And you just -- you know, you just. This is...GUTFELD: Stuff it in. There you go.WILLIAMS: I know, it's like we really don't get to eat.PERINO: There's another fork. Go for it, Eboni.GUTFELD: All right.GUILFOYLE: This is fantastic. I-HOP, thank you. We love you.BOLLING: While you guys dig in, Dana is up.PERINO: OK. I want to thank -- we have guests that came today, John and Marianna, and they brought the Tulip Sweet Shop from Goral (ph) Park, New York, chocolate box, which is great.And I also want to just remind everybody next Friday -- that's March 4, I'm going to be in Washington, D.C., for CPAC. I'm going to do a panel on millennials and millennial issues and conservative values, meeting millennials' goals. That's going to be on Friday, early afternoon. So I hope that, if you're going to be there, you make it. And we might even have a little surprise shout-out from ""The Five"" for everybody.BOLLING: That would be great.PERINO: Now, that's not a surprise.BOLLING: Gregory.GUTFELD: Millennials, those are Pepperidge Farm, right? They're delicious.GUILFOYLE: Can you eat them?PERINO: They are quite good.BOLLING: They come in mint?GUTFELD: Yes, they do.GUILFOYLE: They'll be part of my Food Court next.GUTFELD: It's time for something.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Crime Corner.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Look at your hat.GUTFELD: Spread them. All right. So...WILLIAMS: You're at quota already, Greg.GUTFELD: A unicorn got loose -- got loose and led the police on a four- hour chase through the streets of Madeira County, California. This was Wednesday night. Take a look at this. It was in a photo shoot.GUILFOYLE: Is that yours?GUTFELD: The owner is photographer Sandra Booze, odd name. But anyway, it was with a group of kids. It got loose. It ran all over town.Now, why is this ""Crime Corner""? Because if you take a close look, that is not a unicorn. That is a horse wearing a horn.You know what?PERINO: My God.GUTFELD: You might think it's fun to trick children into thinking that that's a real unicorn, but where I come from, that is disgusting. That is disgusting. This woman should be ashamed of herself. You never try to pretend you're a unicorn, unless of course, you know, it's a honeymoon and...BOLLING: Or Halloween.GUTFELD: On Halloween.WILLIAMS: OK. Speaking of holidays, guys, I know it's only February but I'm starting my Christmas list early today. Mom, lean into the television. This is for you.This is the newest American Girl from the American Girl doll collection. Her name is Melody Ellison. She's celebrating the civil rights era.PERINO: Cute.WILLIAMS: And I've actually been holding a grudge against my mother for the better part of almost 30 years.PERINO: Wow.GUILFOYLE: Why?PERINO: You've got to let that go.WILLIAMS: Not really -- because she never gave me a doll.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: I wanted one of these so bad.PERINO: Never once a doll? You never once got a doll?WILLIAMS: I got a doll, but I wanted an American Girl doll, Dana. I wanted this fancy, like, 100-plus-dollar doll.PERINO: My sister wanted a Cabbage Patch Kid, and my mom was like, ""Those dolls are too expensive."" So she knew somebody who was hand making them, and she got one for my sister, and she -- my sister was mortified.WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.PERINO: Then she ended up getting -- my sister got a real Cabbage Patch doll.GUTFELD: I used to take pantyhose and fill it with sand, and then take buttons for eyes, and then I would name them and take them everywhere I go.PERINO: Oh, my God. That's where mine went?BOLLING: I have to do this. On the heels of that, I have to promo this. Chris Christie will now sit down with Greta Van Susteren tonight, ""On the Record""...GUILFOYLE: All right.BOLLING:... 7 p.m. So make sure you don't miss that.

9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/06/18/investigating-clinton-foundation/	Investigating the Clinton Foundation 	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" June 17, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Impact Segment"" tonight, the Clinton Foundation.As you may know a book called ""Clinton Cash"" has listed a number of people that could very well be illegal surrounding the charitable enterprise known as the Clinton Foundation. For example Russia has purchased a large uranium mine in the U.S.A. That was ok'd by Hillary Clinton's State Department as well as other agencies.But in the process more than $2 million was donated to the Clinton Foundation by a guy who stood to benefit from the uranium sale. Also former president bill Clinton was paid a half million dollars for one speech in Moscow by a Russian bank linked to the deal. And there is more.Joining us now from Washington the legendary Watergate reporter Bob Woodward. So, initially, there was some reporting in the ""Washington Post"", ""New York Times"" on the Clinton Foundation but not much lately. How do you see it?BOB WOODWARD, ""WASHINGTON POST"": Well, first of all, this is a giant story and to do it right, you have to be very systematic. If you go back to the Nixon era, he had a campaign re-election committee and the story was that it had really very little connection to the White House. When you dug into it you found that the re-election committee was taking orders from the White House.The question here in the Clinton Foundation in all of these activities, including the speeches, exactly how is it organized? Who decides -- to get that story will take weeks and months.O'REILLY: How long did it take you and Bernstein, how long did it take you to put the trail together before it really got to be critical mass? How much time?WOODWARD: Certainly months and then to really fully comprehend what was going on and the extent of the illegality and criminality took a year or even more, up to two years until Nixon's resignation.O'REILLY: Do you believe -- there is only really three or four vehicles in this country because television news is certainly not going to do it. There are fine investigative reporters like Brian Ross at ABC. But, by and large, it's a newspaper story. Because it's going to take, as you said, a lot of time to put all of these things together and shift around and sift through the BS and get to the heart of the story.Do you believe that newspapers have assigned a team of investigators to do this?WOODWARD: I do. And --O'REILLY: Do you know in the ""Washington Post"" because I know you have a relationship with them -- have they a team?WOODWARD: Yes -- certainly. I mean, you know, this week there are serious meetings about it. It's going to be looked at clearly in the ""New York Times"".O'REILLY: In the ""Washington Post"" there were serious meetings this week?WOODWARD: Of course.O'REILLY: Ok. Well, no, no, no, don't give me of course. You know how the medias has changed over the years. We're an ideological media now. We're not -- it isn't the way it was back when you and Bernstein were running around. It's not that way anymore. It's corporate. There is a lot of money involved in this. There is a lot of politics involved with this. You know that. Come on, Bob.WOODWARD: I tell you, if you were there, there is independent aggressiveness, let's look at in this in detail and I think it's going to happen. Now, the big question and you've raised it, are there illegal transactions here? And that really requires digging.O'REILLY: Here is the rub on that. I don't think the press can get to that because the level is so high, unless you have a deep throat. The guy who spilled it to you and Bernstein. That would have to be somebody who come in.WOODWARD: Only one of many sources and you keep going.O'REILLY: Ok. But you need a guy from the inside. You need somebody from the inside. But I've called for the FBI to investigate this and the FBI tells us, the bureau, well, we can't say if we are investigating or not.Well, guess what? The FBI is investigating the St. Louis cardinals for hacking into the Houston Astros. That's all over the place. They can announce that but they can't tell me they are investigating the Clinton Foundation? What's that.WOODWARD: Well, we don't know. But the lesson for the media which is your questions and I think it's an important one is you discover what would be called incremental coverage, that you are going to keep going at it. You are going -- I mean one of the questions and let's talk about it in six months or nine months, do we really understand how much money in dollars and cents, not generalities, that the Clintons walked away with or that people in the foundation who work for them, you know.O'REILLY: Shouldn't the FBI be taking the lead? I want the press to investigate it because I want honest government. But the FBI has subpoena powers. You know, they can go in and they get all of this stuff. Whereas you and me and others we can't. We have to rely on other people.Last word.WOODWARD: Sure. But the FBI relies on other people, too. And they need credible evidence that a crime has been committed.O'REILLY: The FBI?WOODWARD: Let's step back and be fair minded about this.O'REILLY: I think we should be fair. I think we should be watchdogs and aggressive, too.WOODWARD: I'm all with you. And what I want to know is what's the net worth? What did the Clintons have in terms of money and assets? You know, there will be a lot of smoke between this and between that. I think it's important to know and I think one of the measures of how successful or unsuccessful the press is in this is getting that answer, not some big number.O'REILLY: We will continue to encourage everybody to try to get that. Bob, thanks very much.WOODWARD: Thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
