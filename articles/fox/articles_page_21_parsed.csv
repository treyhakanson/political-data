This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And this is a Fox News Alert. Airport suicide bombings rock the city of Istanbul, Turkey. The country's prime minister says indications once again point to ISIS being responsible for this attack.Now, the latest numbers put the death toll at 36, 147 wounded, but Turkish government officials say that those figures could, in fact, go higher.Also tonight, we'll have a lot of reaction to the new report released by the House select committee on Benghazi.But first, our own Catherine Herridge. She's in Washington. She has the very latest on the airport bombings in Turkey. The videos are chilling, Catherine.CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right. Sean, tonight, the administration is deeply engaged with the briefing of the president, the attorney general and the homeland security secretary. These are all indicators the situation in Istanbul is serious and may have direct implications for security at American airports.All scheduled flights between the U.S. and Istanbul are suspended while investigators work out what happened and who was responsible, the FAA confirming tonight that a ground stop is in place until further notice.A government official said the attacks fit the profile of ISIS, which has stepped up its campaign in Turkey, going for international targets with an economic impact. A local Kurdish group has traditionally focused on the Turkish military.Let me draw your attention to this one piece of video. It's graphic, but it does show one of the bombers firing inside the terminal, shot in the leg. He then falls to the ground as the guard approaches and sees the suicide vest, runs, and the bomber detonates.The fact that the bomber came in guns blazing suggests to me, based on my experience, that the goal may have been to take hostages first and then use a suicide vest in a standoff. If he had only wanted to blow himself up, he would have walked into the terminal, straight to the passenger line and detonated.With more than 30 dead tonight, ISIS is one of the few terror groups with the capability to build bombs of this strength. One of the striking similarities between Istanbul and the Brussels airport attack in March is that both explosions knocked the airport ceiling tiles out, telling us the explosion was strong enough to impact the terminal's structural integrity.To be clear, there's been no claim of responsibility by any terror group tonight, ISIS, al Qaeda or the Kurds. But the intelligence community has believed ISIS sent trained operatives into Europe in advance of Ramadan -- Sean.HANNITY: All right, Catherine Herridge in Washington, thank you.HERRIDGE: You're welcome.HANNITY: Donald Trump is reacting to the airport suicide bombings in Istanbul. Here is what the presumptive Republican nominee said at a rally earlier tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We had another suicide bombing, Istanbul, Turkey, many, many people killed, many, many people injured. Folks, there's something going on that's really, really bad, all right? It's bad. And we better get smart and we'd better get tough, or we're not going to have much of a country left, OK?(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, here with reaction, former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, as we look at these images again tonight, this is not the JV team, as Obama said. They are not contained, as he said before Paris. It's Brussels. It's France. It's Orlando. It's San Bernardino. It's everywhere.And you know, this obsession with not saying ""radical Islam"" -- they're not workplace violence, overseas contingencies, man-caused disasters. How could they be so wrong so often?NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think you have to understand that on the American left, there is an ideological, passionate commitment to a world view which is out of touch with reality, but which they genuinely believe.In a sense, you're getting a reflection of the courses Obama took at Columbia when he was an undergraduate and the whole notion of how the world should work according to left-wing American professors.Now, the problem they've got is, tragically, the world doesn't work that way, that we're faced with objective realities. We're reminded almost every week.You know, I tried to point out to people when the Orlando killings occurred, and there's this whole effort to turn it into gun control. I said, Wait a second. You had the second Canadian businessman beheaded in the Philippines during the same cycle that we're talking about, and yet somehow, that didn't quite penetrate that maybe it's a worldwide thing.You had a number of young girls (INAUDIBLE) who were literally burned to death because they had rejected sexual relations with ISIS, and somehow, that didn't quite break through. So you go to case after case. Now you have a new one.Callista and I have been, as you know, because we talked about it before, Sean -- Callista and I have been in that airport. It's a wonderful place.  Turkish Air may be one of the greatest airlines in the world. They've done a tremendous job of becoming a modern country. And here are barbarians from the 7th century showing up with modern technology, determined to kill the rest of us unless we submit. And that's -- this is the core argument...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: But that's a truth that they're not willing to acknowledge here.GINGRICH: Right.HANNITY: And not only -- and not only as evidenced by what they say, you know, man-caused disasters. They're trying to turn Orlando into gun control. But that's releasing Gitmo detainees so they can go back in the battlefield and try and kill more people. That's giving $150 billion to the number one state sponsor of terror, Iran. You know, that's giving Mohamed Morsi, a guy that once referred to the Israelis as descendants of apes and pigs, tanks, F-16s and a billion dollars.You know, and these are the same people that want to bring in refugees in spite of what our CIA director, FBI director, assistant FBI director, special envoy to defeat ISIS all warn us that ISIS will infiltrate that population, and they're willing to gamble with the lives of every American!There is a disconnect here that is bordering on pathological!GINGRICH: Right. So the thing we've got to figure out, the thing that Donald Trump has to figure out and the Republicans at every level in the country have to figure out, is how do you draw the contrast between reality, what you and I are watching tonight tragically from Turkey, and the insanity of the Democrats?Take, for example, the race with Russ Feingold and Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. Russ Feingold is a very attractive, very pleasant, very nice guy whose views of the planet are deranged. And somehow, we've got to get across to people this is a man whose economic, diplomatic and military policies are going to get a lot of people killed.Now, that's politically incorrect. One's not allowed to say that. But I'm here to tell you if we don't start telling the American people the truth, we're going to pay in dead Americans for our unwillingness to have a fierce, direct national debate.HANNITY: You know, Mr. Speaker, when you put it in its totality now -- he was wrong saying the JV team. He was wrong saying that they were contained. He wouldn't acknowledge radical Islamic terrorism. You know, add to that man-caused disasters and overseas contingencies and workplace violence. Then you add to that giving the Iranians money. You add to that giving Morsi money. You add to that not securing the border. You add to that releasing Gitmo detainees.Honestly, I think at some point, there's got to be a reality check. And if you add the refugees on top of this -- that there seems to be no concern about putting American people -- the American people's lives at risk here.What is the reason for this lack of understanding of the world as it really is?GINGRICH: Well, I think that both Barack Obama, and to be candid, Hillary Clinton represent a hard-line left-wing world view in which the problem is always America and in which they can't -- they cannot bring themselves to render judgments. They can't bring themselves to say the words ""Islamic terrorism"" or ""Islamic supremacism,"" which I prefer, because it would violate their core principle that you should always be in situational ethics, you should always be careful not to discriminate.This is insane! I mean, you're dealing with people who want to kill you and you're telling us, as the attorney general said, that the correct answer to terrorism is love? No, the correct answer to terrorism is to kill the terrorists!HANNITY: Let me ask you this question, if I can. And we're going to have another segment with you, but we're going to continue to run these pictures out of Turkey as we speak here.But the Benghazi report comes in today. We learned something. 600 times security was denied before the attack. During the attack, a stand down order was given, and our troops were told to change their clothes four times, and we needed, you know, permission from the Libyans to actually save Americans, and that's what they were discussing.And then after we were told a lie because Hillary told her own daughter, the Libyan president, the Egyptian prime minister, that it was a terror attack, but told us something totally differently. Your thought in the last minute we have in this segment.GINGRICH: It's very straightforward. Barack Obama, for reelection purposes, lied to the American people. Hillary Clinton, as the loyal puppet of Barack Obama, lied to the American people.There is no other possible explanation of what we have learned. They did it knowingly. They did it deliberately. They did it with cruelty that's unimaginable. And in her case, she lied to the families who lost loved ones, and we now know today it was an absolute lie.HANNITY: Let me put up on the screen the e-mail she sent to her daughter the night of the attack. ""Two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Qaeda-like group, the ambassador, whom I hand-picked, and a young communications officer on temporary duty with a wife and two very young children. Very hard day, and I fear more of the same tomorrow.""She was telling us at the exact same time something very different. This was related to a YouTube video. It's breath-taking!GINGRICH: Look, the level of coldness and heartlessness and deliberate, you know, misinformation is worthy of Orwell's 1984. The idea of a human being who could be this heartless and could tell this kind of a lie to the families when she's face to face with them, when they have lost a loved one, it is frightening to think how deeply heartless she is!HANNITY: All right, Newt Gingrich, stay right there. When we come back, this is coming up with Newt right after the break.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GARY BYRNE, FORMER SECRET SERVICE OFFICER: She's blown up at me before, and agents and her staff -- at one time I saw her staff so afraid to tell her about a mistake that was made.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Newt Gingrich reacts to our explosive interview with former Clinton White House Secret Service officer Gary Byrne. Newt will weigh it on that.And also tonight, and later, House select committee on Benghazi released their report on the 2012 terror attack. One of the select committee members, Congressman Mike Pompeo, and Kris Taranto (sic) Paronto -- he's going to be here with reaction. He was one of the heroes that night.That and much more tonight on this busy news night on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BYRNE: I feel so strongly that people need to know the real Hillary Clinton and how dangerous she is in her behavior. She is not a leader. She is not a leader.HANNITY: She doesn't have the temperament.BYRNE: She doesn't have the temperament. She didn't have the temperament to handle the social office when she was first lady. She does not have the temperament.HANNITY: She's dishonest.BYRNE: She's dishonest. She habitually lies. Anybody that, you know, can separate themselves from their politics and review her behavior over the last...HANNITY: You're going to be accused of this being political.BYRNE: Absolutely, I'm sure I will be. I have been already.HANNITY: And what's your answer?BYRNE: It's not. It's got nothing to do with politics.There's been examples that I cite in my book where she blows up at people.  Like I said, she's blown up at me before and agents and her staff. At one time, I saw her staff so afraid to tell her about a mistake that was made.  They weren't upset about the waste of the mistake, ordering the wrong invitations. They were terrified that someone was going to have to tell Hillary Clinton that there was a mistake made.I hope someday that it does make a difference. I mean, if Mrs. Clinton ends up being the president of the United States, then she's our president and she's the commander-in-chief, and it is what it is.But if she did become the president without me speaking the truth, I'm not sure I could -- I could deal with that. People need to know. This is serious. And her behavior is appalling. And she's two different people.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That was former Secret Service officer Gary Byrne last night right here on this program, describing what it was like to work in the Clinton White House.Back with us for more reaction, former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich.He only reinforced something George Stephanopoulos said and Dee Dee Myers said, a volcanic temper, you know, to the point where she threw a vase in the residency, gave Bill a black eye, he believes, that would scream and yell and belittle and just explode at people, actually cursing out Secret Service agents, telling them to F off and go to hell and throwing a Bible at one of them and hitting him in the head.That's what he tells in this book. And yet temperament is only measured in the media about Donald Trump. Your reaction to that?GINGRICH: Well, look, the fix is in. The elite media is terrified of Donald Trump. They are absolutely committed to the election of Hillary Clinton. They are willing to do things like this totally phony Washington Post poll that grossly oversampled Democrats and was clearly false, and anybody who looked at it would have known it.They have The New York Times going back to vet, you know, Donald Trump's dating habits 25 years ago, getting it wrong and being repudiated by the very women they interviewed.I mean, you just have to assume that you're going to get, from now to election day, an unendingly one-sided coverage which does everything it can to prop up Hillary Clinton and everything it can to shrink Donald Trump.One of the lessons of Brexit may be that, in fact, in the end, it doesn't matter. People look past the media to draw their own conclusions and decide that they're not going to vote -- they're not going to do it again.HANNITY: You bring up The New York Times issue. The media is so corrupt that, you're right, that all the women that they quoted repudiated them and said that they manufactured comments that they never made, and they had just the opposite feelings of what they described. But they never interviewed Juanita Broaddrick or Kathleen Willey or Paula Jones or Dolly Kyle, and they all have stories to tell.Imagine if this was a book written about Donald Trump. I would imagine CBS, NBC and ABC would cover it. So far, they have not, which doesn't surprise me. But you know it would be, you know, front-page news for weeks and weeks if it was Trump. How do you overcome that?GINGRICH: Look, well, you overcome it by what Donald Trump did today in Pittsburgh. I mean, you give serious, straightforward speeches that are powerful. You do what he did the other day at Turnberry in Scotland, where he was very clear, very calm, communicated key values in a very positive way.I mean, Trump's ability with social media and his ability -- if he stays disciplined and he stays focused and he gives speeches like this, he's going to win the election.And there's not much that Hillary can do to stop him because in the end, it's going to come down to -- and in my newsletter today, which -- brief commercial, people can get by going to Gingrichproductions.com. It's free.My newsletter today takes Italy, Austria, Iceland, Britain. In every one of those cases in the last two months, you had the outs defeat the ins, in some cases by enormous margins, because there's this feeling around the world that the establishment's corrupt. The establishment has failed. The establishment's not good for my future and not good for my country.And after the elites get done yelling and screaming, people are just walking over them.HANNITY: Yes.GINGRICH: I mean, the top professional politician in Iceland on Sunday got 13 percent in the presidential race.HANNITY: You know...GINGRICH: Everybody above him was a new candidate or was a non-politician.HANNITY: Some of the things you said you wanted to see out of Donald Trump -- he seems to be far more disciplined, rapid response, a lot of messaging, maybe more on message and not willing to go off script so much because that plays into the only narrative that it seems Hillary has.And she's coordinating with Obama and Democrats. The only issue they want to seem to bring up is Donald Trump and Donald Trump's personality. Well, this Secret Service officer gives a narrative about Hillary's temperament that I think the country ought to be pay attention to, how ineffective she is and corrupt and dishonest on the Benghazi issue.Are you happy with the progress that he has made in terms of the way he's directing his message at the American people?GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think a couple things are really starting to work.  Trump himself is becoming much more focused, much more understanding of what it means to be the nominee for president, a much bigger job than back when you were one of 17.He has gotten, I think, a great speechwriter in Stephen Miller. They are a good team. They work together really well. And Paul Manafort is doing a terrific job of building a team. This is rapidly becoming a national-class operation capable of -- along working with Reince Priebus of the RNC, capable of taking on Hillary in a straight-on fight. And I think that's going to come as a huge shock to the left.HANNITY: And any word on where you stand? Have they been vetting you at all for any possible position?GINGRICH: I have -- I have -- listen, I have been standing right here on your show week after week, and I will continue. I want you to know, Sean, that I will continue to stand...(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: I knew you weren't going to answer the question, so I just did it for pure amusement and entertainment purposes only.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: By the way, it was fun on radio today because I had you and Patrick Kennedy on, and it's a really good cause. There's so much addiction. I mean, all these kids get started with Vicodin, Percocet and Oxy, and then they can't afford an $80 pill and they move to heroin at $10 a bag.And it's become a national epidemic, and you guys have actually teamed up.  So I congratulate you.GINGRICH: Yes, well, if you go to Opioidrecovery.com, Patrick Kennedy's showing real leadership. We have a bipartisan team working on this. We think it is possible to use new, modern breakthroughs with medication therapies that really help save lives. And remember that the total drug deaths annually now are greater than deaths from automobiles.HANNITY: Scary. It's really (INAUDIBLE)GINGRICH: So this is a real problem for America.HANNITY: Yes. All right, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.And coming up, more on the House select committee's report on Benghazi.  We'll get reaction from Congressman Mike Pompeo and Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto.  He was one of the heroes that night.Plus, Elizabeth Warren hitting the campaign trail with Hillary Clinton.  Later tonight, we'll expose Warren's controversial positions and why Trump calls her ""Pocahontas.""All that and more tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAT SMITH, SON KILLED IN BENGHAZI ATTACK: I want her to apologize to me for calling me a liar on TV because this is clearly not true. And I want to know why my son was left to die, breathing in diesel smoke, which is the most horrible way to die. And she didn't do anything to stop it. She could have.She ought to be in -- in -- she ought to be wearing stripes! I want to see this woman in stripes because she lied, and the different things that she did say were very, very, totally wrong. My son is dead because of her. I -- I -- I would like to talk to her!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That was Pat Smith back in April. Her son, Sean, was one of the four Americans killed during that attack in Benghazi.Joining us now is a member of the Benghazi select committee. Kansas congressman Mike Pompeo is with us. How many requests were there before the attack for extra, additional security in the region?REP. MIKE POMPEO, R-KAN.: Sean, there were over 600 requests that said, We've got a problem. This is the lawless part of Libya. We need help. We are undermanned. There were folks who were talking about it being a suicide mission.HANNITY: And the Red Cross left?POMPEO: That's right. Multiple terror attacks, some of them at our own facility. And yet insufficient security was provided and we ended up with (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: And during the attack, we had people ready to go help, and they changed clothes four times because they didn't know if they wanted them to actually go in in uniform? And we were asking permission of Libya to save Americans while they were under fire.POMPEO: One of the things that our report shows very clearly is that Secretary Clinton put politics and her political legacy way ahead of the people on the ground. They were dithering for two hours in a telephone conference call while mortars were falling in Libya, and they're talking about things not related to...HANNITY: Didn't we have video of this going on? Didn't we have real-time video?POMPEO: There was. For much of the evening there in Benghazi, we had real-time video that was being fed back to...HANNITY: So she knew. She had to know that the fight was ongoing, and they're sitting there talking about a video?POMPEO: Oh, it was well known that the fight was going on in Washington, D.C. There was no surprise. The difference between the firefight and the intensity and the urgency and the valor in Benghazi, and the lame, unvigorous attack in Washington, D.C., is deeply disturbing.HANNITY: So -- and we had guys ready to go help them.POMPEO: That's right.HANNITY: And they wouldn't pull the trigger. They wouldn't say go.POMPEO: Sean, at no time, at no time was there ever an aircraft inbound for Benghazi, Libya, during the entire evening. And for the first seven hours, there wasn't even a vehicle, an aircraft, a soldier that had moved towards Libya.HANNITY: And they knew this first at what, 3:30 or 4:00 in the afternoon?POMPEO: It would have been about 3:42 Washington, D.C., time when the first knowledge of the attack reached Washington.HANNITY: And Leon Panetta told the president in a prearranged meeting in the Oval Office, right?POMPEO: That's right, about 5:00 P.M., he went to the Oval Office (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: Here's another thing. The president didn't even read the next day his -- didn't get his presidential intelligence briefing?POMPEO: That's correct. It's remarkable. At no time did the president ever gather his troops, right? You would think you've got an ambassador missing, you would gather. They were all in Washington, the director of the CIA, the secretary of defense, the secretary of state are all in Washington, and at no time did they even say, Hey, we want to get together and figure this out so that we can save lives in Benghazi, Libya.HANNITY: And while simultaneously telling us afterwards that this was related to a YouTube video, which they were negotiating while the fight was still going on, not trying to save Americans, that she wrote her daughter, the Libyan president, Egyptian prime minister it was a terror attack, but told us, the American people, something different.POMPEO: Again, this is politics ahead of those folks on the ground, Sean.  She knew within hours, as did the U.S. government, that this was a terrorist attack, radical Islamic terror.HANNITY: Then why did they lie?POMPEO: No, I just think there were 56 days left to an election. It didn't fit the narrative of Usama bin Laden is dead and GM was alive. And just in the same way they clipped the 911 reports in Orlando, they didn't want to tell the American people the truth about the fact that radical Islamic terrorists were attacking America that night.HANNITY: What do you take out of this about her?POMPEO: Terrible leadership, poor judgment, and a willingness to put her own personal political legacy ahead of the people that she sent into harm's way.HANNITY: This is heart-breaking. If it's my son or daughter, I am livid beyond words tonight!POMPEO: Yes, sir. I keep thinking if it was my son, what I would have thought if the American government had reacted that way after they sent my son into harm's way. It was morally reprehensible.HANNITY: One of the heroes, by the way, of that night is with us now.  Joining us now with reaction to the select committee's final report is a man who witnessed the Benghazi attack firsthand, former army ranger Kris -- I call him ""Tanto"" Paronto, is with us. I'm going to keep the congressman here with us. We've been friends. You told the story. How many times were you told to stand down that night? You were at the CIA annex about a mile or two away, right?KRIS ""TANTO"" PARONTO, CHAIRMAN, LEADING FROM THE FRONT: Not even that.  About three-quarters of a mile as the crow flies. It would have taken us, even on foot, if we would have been unhindered on foot, 10 minutes to get there. A drive, it took us maybe a minute. Thirty minutes we were told to wait, and then the words ""stand down"" were used. You know what, it's --HANNITY: At least three times, you told me, right?PARONTO: At least three times. Twice the words ""wait"" were used. Once the words ""stand down"" were used. To me, it's semantics. ""Wait,"" ""stand down."" It's the same thing.HANNITY: You and the other heroes of Benghazi in the movie ""13 Hours,"" you guys decided to put your career on the line. You knew Americans were under fire, and you just said we're not standing down. You went. Ty Woods died and Glen Doherty died going against orders, risking their whole career to save those Americans under fire. True?PARONTO: Well, that's where patriotism comes over politics, and that's where we have a problem with me and Mrs. Clinton. Patriotism is always going to Trump politics. We're going to risk our lives to save Americans.  She didn't.HANNITY: Who told you to stand down?PARONTO: Our chief of base. It was local CIA leadership for us. Whether how far it went up, I don't know.HANNITY: Congressman, that's a question for you maybe. Where would that order have come from?POMPEO: Best we can tell from the evidence it came from that chief of base. He was the one telling those amazing heroes who risked their lives to save lots of Americans that night.HANNITY: But Tanto, when you hear the congressman say there was a live feed of the attack going on and this lasted all these hours and they didn't send anybody to help you, it takes my breath away. That's not the America I know, that they tell the marines, oh, you can't go in uniform. Wait a minute. We can't send anybody. We need permission from Libya to send our troops to go save Americans lives. Really? I don't want Libya's permission.PARONTO: Here's what I gathered off the report is that they weren't even contemplating coming to Benghazi. This is news to me. This hurts me.  This pisses me off because I was seeing and hearing not only were people not moving at all to even assist, but they weren't even thinking about coming to Benghazi. That's what bothers me. That's something new I found out.HANNITY: The guys at Benghazi, they're watching on video, live feed.PARONTO: Exactly.HANNITY: Tanto, you're a hero of mine and a friend. Thank you so much for being with us. Congressman, thank you for your hard work and telling the American people the truth here.POMPEO AN: Thank you, sir.HANNITY: And it's so sad those four men dies that day, and it could have been prevented. And 600 requests.Coming up, Hillary Clinton is starting to bring Elizabeth Warren out on the campaign trail with her. Coming up next, a ""Hannity"" investigation. Who is Elizabeth Warren? We'll look at her controversial policy positions and much more. And why does Trump call her Pocahontas?And later, an explosive new report reveals thousands of Americans are on a ISIS hit list, but the FBI doesn't contact people on that list. You'll meet the reporter who broke that story as we continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This is a Fox News alert. I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York.Major transportation hubs around the globe on high alert tonight following another deadly bomb attack. This time terrorists targeted the international airport in Istanbul, Turkey, one of the world's busiest airports. Security cameras captured the chaotic scene inside. At this hour, at least 39 people, including three terrorists, are known dead.  Nearly 150 people are injured. No word yet if any Americans are among the victims.Witnesses tell us the attackers arrived at the airport by taxi, exchanged gunfire with police, and then blew themselves up. The nation's prime minister says all indications point to ISIS as the culprits, but no one has yet claimed responsibility. The attack prompted the FAA to ground all flights between the U.S. and Istanbul. That order has since been lifted.I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to HANNITY. For all of your headlines remember to log on to FoxNews.com.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS.: I'm here today because I'm with her.Hillary has brains. She has guts. She has thick skin and steady hands.  But most of all, she has a good heart.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, that was leftwing Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who Donald Trump calls Pocahontas, campaigning yesterday with Hillary Clinton, a desperate move from the Clinton camp, trying to boost Hillary's credibility with Bernie Sanders voters.But why does Trump call Warren Pocahontas? Well, back in 2012 while running for the Senate, it came to light that Warren had listed herself as a Native American in professional directories. Her opponent at the time, former senator Scott Brown, claimed that she used it to further her career.  Here's Warren's explanation of her ancestry. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WARREN: I have lived in a family that has talked about Native American, talked about tribes, since I've been a little girl. I still have a picture on my mantle at home, and it's a picture my mother had before that, a picture of my grandfather. And my aunt Bea has walked by that picture at least 1,000 times, remarked that he -- that her father, my papa had high cheekbones like all of the Indians do.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: A dead giveaway. Now, Warren is well known for her populist criticism of banks and financial institutions. She also made this shocking statement in 2011 while running for the Senate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WARREN: There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own, nobody.  You built a factory out there. Good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: You didn't build that. Sound familiar? Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor Herman Cain and the co-host of ""The Five,"" author of the brand new book ""Wake Up America, The Nine Virtues that Made our Nation Great and Why We Need Them More than Ever,"" Eric Bolling. By the way, thank you for the autographed copy. I really appreciate it. And it's a great book. I've been reading it. Great job. All right, high cheekbones her papa had.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": Imagine if you or I said that.HANNITY: Why did I think Jimmy the Greek when I heard that?BOLLING: Exactly. Very good point. So I would love --(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Why are you laughing, Herman Cain? ""High cheekbones, my papa""?HERMAN CAIN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Because I have big lips, does that make me black? Good grief.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: I'm not dealing with any comments you make. You're responsible like Neal Boortz is for his own comments.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: But she did this on purpose. That's not a sign of ancestry.CAIN: No.HANNITY: So did you think she did it to advance her career?CAIN: She did it to advance her career, number one. And, number two, the things she talked about basically summed up what you said, you didn't build that. That shows how much she doesn't understand about business and economics as well as everything else that's going on in this country. She was a law professor for 20 years. She is out of touch with reality. She believes that the intellectual elites, the political elites are responsible for this successful nation, and she is totally, totally out of touch with what really built America.HANNITY: Isn't this really about 55 percent in a recent poll of Bernie Sanders supporters will not support Hillary Clinton? And 22 percent go to Trump.BOLLING: It's an opportunity for Donald Trump to pick up some voters, and he really is starting to embrace that. More importantly, forget the fact that Elizabeth Warren said she was one-32nd Cherokee at some point in her life and that may or may not be true. She also was an anti-Hillary Clinton person 10 years ago. When Elizabeth Warren came out and said Wall Street is evil, they demonize the middle class. She said Hillary Clinton has taken too many campaign contributions from Wall Street. She can't judge fairly when Hillary Clinton was running for her Senate seat 15 years ago, whatever it was. So she disliked where Hillary Clinton was in Wall Street.  But now the two of them are twinsies there with the blue pant suits, both of them. Are they both wearing moccasins? I'm not sure. I can't tell.HANNITY: Oh, boy. You're in trouble on your own, too. I'm not taking responsibility for either of you guys. You're all on your own tonight.BOLLING: I'm just saying she has flip-flopped on her first distrust of Hillary Clinton with Wall Street, and now she loves her.HANNITY: Is this because -- I'll throw this to Herman. Is this because, though, she's losing the base, and does she need to pick somebody like Warren or Bernie to shore up the base because they're not energized because she's such a weak candidate?CAIN: Yes. She thinks that the blues sisters are going to attract all of the women and all of the --HANNITY: Everybody's a comedian tonight.(LAUGHTER)CAIN: All the Bernie Sanders supporters.HANNITY: The comments made on the ""Hannity"" who not made by Hannity I'm not responsible for.(LAUGHTER)CAIN: Hannity is not responsible, OK?Here's the thing about this whole thing. Hillary Clinton, through Elizabeth Warren, attacking Donald Trump's qualifications. That's like Mickey Mouse trying to tell Smokey the Bear how to prevent forest fires.  It makes no sense. Neither one of them have ever created any jobs, and now they want to try to demean a guy who has created hundreds of thousands of jobs.HANNITY: Does she help Hillary if she picks her for VP or hurt her?CAIN: I think it hurts her. Based upon the calls I got to date from women, they were disgusted with that display that they had in Cincinnati of them basically doing a Trump attack, which was also a man attack.BOLLING: I think it helps because I think Hillary Clinton, her biggest drawback for the last eight months has been Bernie Sanders. He's been the biggest thorn in her side, not Donald Trump. He gets out of the race, and now she has to struggle to get the Bernie Sanders vote. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the same person.HANNITY: But she's not reaching independents. She's trying to shore up her base. Isn't that a sign of weakness?BOLLING: No. It's a sign of wanting to win. You have that centrist Democrat and you're worried about your base, and you're worried about your base running for Donald Trump as the anti-establishment, then you go head and get someone just like Bernie Sanders.HANNITY: But shoring up your base is a sign of weakness because at this point she ought to be looking -- for example, I always thought it was going to be Kaine from Virginia because I thought he's a more moderate Democrat trying to reach the middle.BOLLING: She's moderate enough.HANNITY: She's a radical leftist like Obama.BOLLING: In their terms she's moderate. They look at her as some sort of war hawk. They look at her as some sort of anti/""I'll take campaign contributions from Wall Street.""HANNITY: You're going to be on the road with your cohorts On ""The Five.""  Are you going to signing you book on the road?BOLLING: I'm going to be reading the book on the road and see if I can get Gutfeld and Perino to read the book. And I think they'll read it. And Juan Williams, he actually learned --HANNITY: There's no hope. There's no hope. Good to see you.BOLLING: Thanks, Sean.HANNITY: and coming up, a damning new report alleges the FBI did not contact Americans that were on an ISIS hit list. How could that happen?  The reporter that broke that story is coming up next as ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So over the past year authorities have allegedly uncovered ISIS-linked lists that contain the names of Americans living within the United States. However, according to a new report from Circa News, quote, ""The FBI did not alert numerous Americans that they were placed on a secret Islamic State kill lists or notify their local police about the potential danger.""We reached out to the FBI. They declined to comment on the story, but they told us, quote, ""The FBI routinely notifies individuals and organizations of potential threat information. We performed these notifications so potential victims are aware of possible threats and take appropriate steps."" Joining me now is the person behind that investigation, national security correspondent at Circa News, Sara Carter. Sara, do we actually have the names of those people?SARA CARTER, NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, CIRCA NEWS: Yes, I do. What is interesting is that the FBI says that is their job, to warn, to inform.  But when I went through these lists, I obtained these kill lists. They're basically databases, Sean. And they had names, addresses, phone numbers, cell phone, as well as work phone numbers, home phone numbers, email addresses. I started contacting the people myself and they had no idea what I was talking about.HANNITY: Are these military people? Are they public figures? What can you tell us about them?CARTER: I can tell you they're every day, average citizens, art curators, real estate agents, schoolteachers, professors. What was interesting though is as I was going through and I was randomly selecting people to call, I did come across one lady, a military wife, she's an army wife. And she said she was notified, actually by the army, that there was a credible threat on her life. But what was interesting was the army actually didn't give her details beyond that. So she was actually terrified. She didn't know who was actually targeting her. She thought it might be terrorism, but they said they declined to give her any further information.And she was just too afraid to contact the FBI or local law enforcement herself.HANNITY: That's crazy.CARTER: Yes, it was insane. So there was quite a few people on that list.  In fact more than two dozen that I had already contacted and talked to that had no idea they were on the ISIS list.HANNITY: Sara, this is a very-important story. You're doing a public service, and I hope authorities now pay attention and inform these individuals about potential threat in their live. Thank you for your great work here. Appreciate it.When we come back, we need your help. A very-important ""Question of the Day"" straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And time for our ""Question of the Day."" So do you think that Hillary Clinton owes an apology at least to the Benghazi victim's families rather than saying, oh, it's time to move on, like she did today? Just go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think. It's more than an apology. Four lives were lost, 600 requests for security. Nobody came to their rescue during the fight. They were too busy figuring out the politics of it all.Thanks for being with us. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Unresolved Problems"" segment tonight. Dirty politics. In San Diego, Republican Carl DeMaio, challenging Democrat Scott Peters for a congressional seat. Mr. DeMaio is gay and has been personally attacked in the past. Two years ago while running for mayor of San Diego, a race he lost, a fake political group put this vicious flyer showing Mr. DeMaio next to a drag queen. The Ethics Commission of California fined three people $7500 in the case and found out they are actually Democrats, the party of inclusions. Joining us now from San Diego is Mr. DeMaio. So, in your current campaign from Congress, have you been smeared at all, has your homosexuality been an issue?CARL DEMAIO (R-CA), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Well, you know, I haven't really been focused on the nasty attacks from the other side. I'm trying to focus on the issues that matter to Americans. The economy, the national debt crisis, holding government accountable, the problems at the V.A., the list goes on and on. But yes, the other side, Bill, has been engaging in some pretty shameful tactics. Just last week my opponent, Congressman Scott Peters promoted on his official campaign Website a blog post that used a gay slur to refer to me. And, again, some groups nationally called him out for it. He didn't even have the courtesy to apologize himself. He blamed it on a staff member.O'REILLY: But I want to (INAUDIBLE) what happens. So, he has a Web site and they run comments from bloggers on the Web site. And there was someone who said something disparaging about you using a gay slur. And it showed up on his Web site. I assume they took it down though real quick?DEMAIO: No. No actually, Bill, it was worse than that. Scott Peters campaign proactively posted this item themselves.O'REILLY: So they put the -- they went out, sought it out, and then put it on?DEMAIO: Correct. Correct.O'REILLY: Wow. That's pretty tough for a Democrat congressman ...(LAUGHTER)O'REILLY: You know, you should make a campaign ad out of that.DEMAIO: You know, the American people don't care about these issues. What they care about ...O'REILLY: No, they do care about character, though. Wouldn't you say? Wouldn't you say they care about character?DEMAIO: At the end of the day, they don't' want to see a food fight. What they want to see are my ideas for moving the economy forward, fixing the national debt. And holding government accountable. That's my record, Bill. And I think that the American people are sick and tired of the shiny object games that go on in these political races. They want to see people who are willing to step forward, offer real ideas to solve problems and focus on those.O'REILLY: All right. Character component in every race. So, let me ask you this. San Diego, your district, a lot of conservative people, our military people down there. Do you think that your homosexuality will lose you votes in the Republican precincts?DEMAIO: No. Not at all. People in San Diego don't think of me as the gay politician. They think of me as the reformer who gets results. When I went onto the city council after a successful career in business, I inherited a city on the brink of bankruptcy. And yet, I put together a coalition, a budget plan and a pension reform initiative that helped save the city, balanced our budget without tax increases, and helped us even restore some important services.O'REILLY: All right. So you are running on fiscal responsibility. Do you have any gay issues that you, you know, gay marriage? Does that come up? Do you look at the social landscape and try to change things there?DEMAIO: Well, absolutely. I believe that as a gay man, government ought not to be deciding what happens for my individual rights or anyone else, for that matter.O'REILLY: But I mean are you promoting gay marriage? Are you in favor of gay marriage?DEMAIO: I support gay marriage. I also believe that people should be treated with dignity and respect with equal protection under the law.O'REILLY: OK. Let me ask you one more question, because I'm ...DEMAIO: Politicians should stay ...O'REILLY: Yeah, I'm running out of time. But this is a key question. So you support gay marriage. Most Republicans don't. In your ...DEMAIO: But I'm increasing the number - are indeed supporting marriage equality.O'REILLY: Yes. And marriage equality is gaining traction. In your state, there was a vote, all right, that marriage is to remain between a man and a woman. The judges overturned that vote. Were you happy?DEMAIO: Yes, I was. Because I think the Supreme Court was - took the right position that people.O'REILLY: To disenfranchise the voters?DEMAIO: And I would like to see this issue be left to individuals to decide. Not politicians, not on elected judges. Let it up for people to decide.O'REILLY: OK, but the people did decide in California. They didn't want gay marriage and then it was overturned by judicial fiat and you are telling me you supported that.DEMAIO: So, you think that a majority should go and decide how each individual should live their lives? I actually want to let individuals to decide.O'REILLY: Listen, if it's a private matter I don't. If it's a public matter, and marriage is, you know that because you have to register, I think the will of the people should be taken into consideration. But we wish you the best, Mr. DeMaio, and your campaign.DEMAIO: Thank you very much, Bill.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
