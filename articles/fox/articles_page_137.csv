This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Impact segment tonight, New poll conducted by the Barna group asked Americans about economics and Jesus.First question, do you think either capitalism or socialism aligns better with the teachings of Jesus? 24% say socialism, 14% capitalism.The question apparently too difficult for the rest of those asked.Which presidential candidates' policies align closest to teaching of Jesus, 21% say Bernie Sanders, 11% Ted Cruz 9% Hillary Clinton and 6% Donald Trump.With that analyze, Eboni Williams and Monica Crowley. The Trump numbers no. Jesus would not be living in the Trump tower surrounded by gold. He wouldn't.MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: I don't think it applies to any presidential candidate ever. Jesus was a transcendent figure. You can't assign modern political philosophy - -O'REILLY: Jesus himself would not be living in the trump tower. That's why I wanted to explain why that number's so low.CROWLEY: He was a humble carpenter.O'REILLY: He had no aspirations material things, Eboni. That poll isn't as crazy as some people might think.EBONI WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It makes total sense to me. A lot of people feel the teachings of Jesus was about the collective. The well-being of the collective is more important than the individuals.O'REILLY: You said the word Christ. This poll did not assign religion. So Christ, if you call Jesus, Jesus Christ, that means you are defining him as the Redeemer.WILLIAMS: Jesus Christ it is to me.O'REILLY: Ascend to do heaven. This one was Jesus the man. Interestingly enough, the philosophy of Jesus was to reject materialism. To depend on other people for your well-being and to give to the poor as much as you could.CROWLEY: Here's the key distinction though, Jesus did not believe in government coercion to redistribute wealth or to demonize the wealthy. Biblical expression is the love of money is the root of evil. Not money itself but love it because it drives a wedge between you and God.O'REILLY: Creates a self-centered situation.CROWLEY: Remember Jesus said rendering unto Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's. They are earthly responsibilities including that the tax man will always commeth. That you do have to take care of that as well.O'REILLY: Pay them.CROWLEY: He believed in private charity. He believed the people taking care of each other, not through coercion, not through state force, for example.O'REILLY: What you think?WILLIAMS: That makes sense to me. I also think for many that they feel there is a moral issue around economics. There is this issue of many people having so little and so few people have a lot.O'REILLY: That's what Bernie Sanders runs on. Morally wrong for the 1%, the billionaires.WILLIAMS: That's why he is so vocal of his praise of the current pope, I believe. That's a place where he really resonates- -O'REILLY: But the Pope live in a lavish. He himself does not live in the chambers, he lives in much more modesty thing. The philosophy that Bernie Sanders spouts is not what Jesus, in my opinion, would be down with. Current vernacular. Because, Bernie wants to take. Jesus never ever took. He wanted you to give.CROWLEY: That is correct. And also Bernie wants to use the full weight of the government.O'REILLY: To take.CROWLEY: Take and then redistributed because the government knows best. Jesus was not a Robin Hood kind of figure.O'REILLY: Know matter how hard Eboni, or Monica or me work. Bernie feels that he has authority, or should have the authority to take from us, all right, to an extent that inflicts pain.CROWLEY: Injury, we would say in the law.O'REILLY: Right. Because I don't want to pay more than 50% of my earnings to anyone.CROWLEY: That goes back to classic Marxisms. You talked about how he took his honeymoon not in Vegas but in the Soviet Union.O'REILLY: That's right. You see powers face? She was giving me jazz and I hit the honeymoon and she was out of here.CROWLEY: It's all about the vanguard. The ruling elite taking from the people to redistribute and ultimately the state would wither away. But, it's never worked that way in practice.O'REILLY: I believe this poll is accurate, that most people thinking about well, Jesus, he probably would be with Sanders because Sanders wants to redistribute to the poor.All right. Here's what I've done. And I shouldn't say this, but here's what I have done. When I die, which could be anytime now because - -WILLIAMS: - - That's a long time away.O'REILLY: I've been a lot of sugar.CROWLEY: On the show for the ratings.O'REILLY: Most of my money will go to charity, my charitable foundation.WILLIAMS: That's great. You're giving it away voluntarily?O'REILLY: I'm trying to buy my way to heaven. That's the strategy. Frank Sinatra tried to do that.CROWLEY: It didn't work.O'REILLY: Bernie wants to take more of that money that's earmarked for children and vets and all of that, so he can throw it away on government programs that we all know.CROWLEY: The government is doing such a great job of managing it?O'REILLY: Bernie, get out of my face, I'm going to heaven - - well, maybe not.CROWLEY: Critical point what we know as socialism, the track record is pretty bad. Equal share of misery and poverty and oppression.WILLIAMS: I agree with not criticizing and demonizing prosperity.O'REILLY: Alright, ladies.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

While the economy will drive the vote, social issues like gay marriage are important to many Americans. My take is this. It's a matter of conscience. There are good people who support gay marriage and good people who oppose it. Also there are plenty of bad people who exploit the issue with accusations of bigotry and such. Unlike abortion nobody gets hurt when gays marry but it does have deep implications for what kind of society we want to be. Therefore, individual states should decide the question. On that, I agree with President Obama. So far seven states have made gay marriage legal but 38 states have passed legislation opposing gay nuptials so for President Obama, this is not a winning hand. He can pretty much say goodbye to North Carolina, which overwhelmingly voted against gay marriage just this week. The President may also lose currency in states like Virginia, Nevada, Florida, Ohio... all of which come down in the traditional marriage category. Mr. Obama seems to understand the political danger. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It will be hard to argue that somehow this is something that I would be doing for political advantage because frankly, you know the... you know the politics, it's not clear how they cut. (END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: The media of course very happy about the President's change of heart. In fact largely because of the press, it's now just about impossible to have an honest debate about gay marriage. If you oppose it you are a bigot, a homophobe, you are a terrible person. Most of the media will not even consider the traditional point of view on marriage. Here is a great example. Writing in the ""New York Times"" yesterday Brian Stelter said, quote: ""Mr. O'Reilly and one of his guests complained last fall when Chaz Bono became the first openly transgender contestant on ABC's `Dancing with the Stars',"" unquote. Well, that's not true. Once again Mr. Stelter writes a falsehood in order to demonize me and Fox News. In an interview with Dr. Keith Ablow who opposed Mr. Bono's appearance on the ABC program I said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: If Chaz Bono is happy with what he has done, all right, if he... he is he a happier guy, I don't know him at all so I don't know whether he is or isn't, but I'm sure he said he is, what's wrong? You are an American. You can choose now with medical science to do a lot of different things, you have the right to do it legally. So what's wrong with him doing it? (END VIDEO CLIP) Now my take has been consistent. Americans have a constitutional right to pursue happiness as Chaz Bono was apparently doing. But this country is not compelled, not compelled to change societal norms unless there is a grave danger of something being done that's harmful. Because of my position liberal guys like Stelter and the ""New York Times"" want to hurt me. And that sends a chilling message to people who do support traditional marriage. Rick Santorum for one got hammered every time he addressed gender issues. Again gay marriage is a matter of conscience. And it's a responsibility of the states to regulate marriage as they see fit. Finally the politics of gay marriage will mostly likely hurt President Obama's re-election chances. But it's doubtful that will be reported by the national press. And that's ""The Memo.""""Pinheads & Patriots."" Big bash in Hollywood this evening; $40,000 will get you a seat in George Clooney's House. The money will go to President Obama's reelection campaign. The event is expected to raise 15 million bucks for the president and is sold out. Expected at the bash, Barbra Streisand, Toby Maguire and Robert Downey Jr., among others. Now, political participation is patriotic, of course. But 40 grand? Well, you can decide if that is ""Pinheaded"" but don't say what your opinion is aloud, because Spider-Man and Iron Man might hear you. A little brawl in here tonight, Downey and Maguire. "
