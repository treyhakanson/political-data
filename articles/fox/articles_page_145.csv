This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: So, privacy advocates fear that Uncle Sam is scanning Facebook and Twitter for stuff on terror strikes, protest and so on. They want Congress to act against big brother who may be spying as you pose that shot of yourself drinking cappuccino in the shower.Why would Hemmer do that?Color me nonplussed. Modern culture is nothing but over-sharing. Social media now is a public rejection of self-restraint where everyone wants to tell you everything about nothing. Now they worry someone might be reading it.The fact is if you think the law wants to mind your post, you're nuts. The worst job in the world for any cop would be to pour through haiku poetry about your cat.Cops want to read people their rights, not an essay on your stuff ferret collection, Kimberly.Even more, if protesters can film cops, why can't the cops film them back? Take the recent protest at that Santa Monica College hundreds of screaming activists crashed the meeting and then were pepper-sprayed. I said before, protesters filmed their instigations in order to orchestrate outrage. So, what you see there?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you (EXPLETIVE DELETED) crazy? We won, we won! They pepper sprayed us!(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: There you go. ""We won, we won they pepper sprayed us."" They wanted to be sprayed because it creates artificial heroes and the media then embraces.So, as always, cameras reveal the truth, which is why I've installed one in Bob's dressing room. I know he stole my satin shorty robe. I just need the proof.BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: Hey, listen, Hemmer can do it because he is Hemmer. I can't. Believe me, I can't.Go ahead. Who's got something to say about to be subject?(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I don't know. Dana, did you post something publicly?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: I thought that was the whole point about your life is going to be on Twitter. Now, if you're like a 40-year-old guy and you are posting things, it's different than if you are a 15-year-old, because the 40-year-old, that's like a new world. The 15-year-old is going to have everything about his life or her life is going to be online. So they need to know that.But I don't know how the parents are actually going to deal with that. But if I was in a position to hire somebody, I am totally going to Google them. If I'm a cop, I'm going to look at what they're saying because you need to know. That is how you find out information.BECKEL: If you look through it, it's the shortest Facebook there is.PERINO: Yes, I don't.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: But if you're posting on Twitter, you're using all the forms of social media available, people to get date. Some people to advertise, et cetera. You are putting yourself out there.(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: Why do the cops have access, particularly to your Facebook?GUTFELD: Well --BECKEL: I read it. It sounds risque, I think.ANDREA TANTAROS, CO-HOST: No, it's not! C'mon, do you think I would put --PERINO: But think how many people will scan your page now.GUILFOYLE: Oh my God.TANTAROS: It's my Facebook.(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: Twitter where -- OK.GUTFELD: But it's all public.TANTAROS: Your cat haikus, first of all, are awesome.GUTFELD: Thank you.TANTAROS: Don't stop writing them.GUTFELD: I won't. Not for you ever.TANTAROS: But the cops aren't looking for the Greg's cat haikus. And I think if they won't to look for them, great. But if they start to hack into Greg's account, now that's a problem. They shouldn't Google him and look at your page.BECKEL: Why should cops be Goggle anything into my Facebook? I don't open --TANTAROS: Bob, give me a break.BECKEL: Seriously. You want them to look into your hidden parts of Facebook?GUILFOYLE: Perfect. Go ahead and do it. Honestly.Really, I don't want them to waste too much time on me because I'm not committing serious crimes.Why, Bob -- here we go, here we go. Well behaved.Bob, you don't have expectation of privacy if you are sitting there doing all of this and you are doing tweets and your Facebook, you're putting it out there. By the way, it's a very useful law enforcement tool, because the dumb-dumbs, the felony stupids out there, post stuff like pictures of the burglaries or the home invasion.BECKEL: That's the argument, because you do it yourself, therefore it's open.(CROSSTALK)TANTAROS: You show up in an era without social media. I can't imagine if in the '60s there was Facebook and Twitter what yours --BECKEL: I grew up in an era without telephones? So, I mean, we have party lines. We learn more about our neighbors on party lines because you could listen in on what they're saying.GUILFOYLE: That's outrage!(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Wait a minute. Bob, I think in your past, the word ""party line"" meant something a little different.BECKEL: It did.GUILFOYLE: Subtle difference.(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: We shared party lines. I want you to know that.GUILFOYLE: Which explains a lot.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
