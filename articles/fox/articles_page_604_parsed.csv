IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.President's Plan to Close Gitmo in Focus as Released Detainee Returns to BattlefieldCharles Payne: Yeah, it's a big one. We're talking of releasing them to go on to be commanders and spokesperson and poster men. Yeah, president Obama is talking about closing it. I get a better suggestion. Let's make it bigger and make it a lot larger and adding people that want to leave the country and fight over seas for ISIS. No, you get on the plane at the airport, guess what you're going to land? In Cuba.Charlie Gasparino: I would say this, there's a political reason behind president Obama looking to close it. There was no logical brief. Yeah, the notion of closing it and president Obama has been nice and been nicer to the world to the Middle Eastern countries than to other presidents before. They want a lot of these.Dagen McDowell: Closing this or moving the detainees to U.S. soil is not going to happen because of the cost of it. President Obama pushed back because it's going to cost $600 million to build a facility here. By the way you have to get past legislation that was passed that the president signed that prohibits the president. He says that he has a way around it but prohibits the closing of the facility here.Ben Stein: Well, they have the signing statement and they have all kinds of ways around the legislation and congress. Then there's litigation about it. I want to go back to what he said. I don't see the rational of closing it. What is the advantage of closing it? There's no logical answer to it.Julie Roginsky: Well, you're right. It's a tune of five to one Bush to Obama of how many were released and went back to the battlefield. I never understood if we can try terrorists and we have and others in federal court hearing in the United States and sentence them to a super maximum and maybe has escaped from, there's plenty of room. Yeah, why not be able to put it where they're completely isolated for 23 and a half hour a day. They're not radicalizing anybody.If Donald Trump Runs as an Independent Would You Still Vote for Him?Charlie Gasparino: They're already nervous. A Wall Street CEO on the Republican side emailed me franticly earlier in the week about Donald's surge, he might win. They do not like it. They want an establishment. Someone that they can bribe.Dagen McDowell: Yeah, it is. You have talked about does he have enough money and how much is he worth? $10 billion. Does he have enough money to run without the back financial backing of someone else? Recent history shows it doesn't go well if you run as an independent. In the '92 election Perot got 19 percent of the vote.Charles Payne: Well, if he does what he says, and up ends Wall Street and then there's $100 billion and there's a lot of money from the corporation and a lot of billionaires in the country and here is the problem. If it's not Trump then it's another Republican singing from the same hymn sheet, and all of these guys have seen him and then it's in establishment.Ben Stein: He brings in more, or does he bring them in. I think that he is incredible, and I think he is the most important political figure of my lifetime since George Wallace and then to the fact that the white working class voter was really PO'd and he was winning the primaries like crazy.Julie Roginsky: The numbers of the delegates and the votes that you need to win are increasingly getting more complicated. This is the fact because they're not in the favor. My point is this. You have Mitt winning the votes and then the next one has to win 40 percent in order to win.Fiorina: Fed Won't Raise Rates Until After ElectionDagen McDowell: I think she's wrong, and if you heard Ben Stein's comment, after the election, that's a long time. Yellin is worried about their reputation, they have made the bed they now have to crawl into, and that is raising interest rates at least once before the start of the next year. If they don't next week, and we have seen markets tumble over the past week, if they don't, it's going to be a downward spiral.Julie Roginsky: I don't think now is the time to raise rates, but it's not a political point, it's an economic point.Charlie Gasparino: Unfortunately, the Fed is in a box, this is not the right time to be raising rates. They should have done it a year ago. If she does not raise rates, the market is going to go down 300 points on the notion that we're headed for a recession.Charles Payne: If she doesn't move it would be interpreted as political. But she should raise them.Ben Stein: It is impossible for them to raise the rates, only mad men and mad women. They're always based on politics. Any voter will say it plays a large part in politics, yes.Stock PicksCharles: Whole Foods Market (WFM)Ben: (SPY) SPDR  "	['Trump', 'Obama']	[]
3	3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/07/07/bill-oreilly-president-obama-and-islam/	Bill O'Reilly: President Obama and Islam	"O'REILLY: ""Personal Story Segment"" tonight, President Obama and Islam. That is the subject of this evening's talking points memo. Many Americans, include this one, believe Barack Obama's emotional attachment to the Muslim world has hurt the USA. There's no question the Obama administration's greatest failure is allowing the Islamic terror group ISIS to run wild, murdering thousands of innocent people all over the world, including many Muslims. Mr. Obama has never, never acknowledged that mistake. Nor does he define the ISIS threat accurately.That group is killing innocent people in order to impose a radical version of Islam on the world. The Jihad is solely based on theology. Perverted as it may be. President Obama, as we all know, will not even use the words Islamic terrorism. Again, today when telling the nation that America will maintain a thousand of troops in Afghanistan, the President did not accurately describe the situation there, putting forth that it was more about politics than Islamic terror.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: That is why the United States will strongly support an Afghan led reconciliation process and why we call on all countries in the region to end safe havens for militants and terrorists.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: But they are not just militants and terrorists. They are Islamic driven killers who protected al Qaeda before the 9/11 attack. Yet the president of the United States does not define the terror issue clearly. Here's why. Barack Obama's father, who abandoned his family, was a Muslim who eventually turned atheist. Then his mother married another Muslim, moving to young berry to Indonesia where he was exposed to the Islamic world, even though he did attend a Catholic school in first grade.According to his half-sister, Barack Obama attended his half brother's wedding in the early 1990s, Malik Obama was a Muslim. The Factor has obtained pictures allegedly from that wedding, which we believe was held in Maryland. Details on the ceremony, the exact location, whether the reports that Barack Obama was the best man are very difficult to verify at this point. What we can tell you with certainty is that Barack Obama has deep emotional ties to Islam.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: As a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk. As a young of man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their Muslim faith.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now, to some extent, I can identify with President Obama on the religion issue. As a Roman Catholic, I was appalled when the priests pedophilia scandal broke. There's absolutely no excuse for the Catholic Church covering up many horrendous crimes. However, like Barack Obama, I do make the distinction between the faith and the people who abuse it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: The church is not the men who run it. The church is the theology behind the doctrine of Jesus, and the country is the abiding philosophy behind the constitution. And I think if everybody understood that, you could put it in perspective.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: But here's where I depart from the President. I went after the American leaders of the Catholic Church with a vengeance.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: As we now know, the leaders of the Catholic Church in America covered up the sexual abuse. At least some of them did. It's my opinion the cardinal law in Boston could be arrested and charged with criminal negligence in the matter. Remember, law admits to transferring pedophile priests to place where they had continuing contact with children. Americans have the right to demand, and I mean, demand that their authorities take care of cardinal law, not the pope, that Americans and authorities take care of a man who aided and abetted the molestation of American children. We have the right, every American citizen, to demand that this cardinal law is removed. It's way beyond just Catholics.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Law was eventually booted out of Boston, but then given a cushy job in Rome, another embarrassment for the Catholic Church. Barack Obama should do what I did. Aggressively call out those who abuse the Muslim faith, who commit atrocities under a religious banner. He should make defeating the Jihad a central issue. And stop trying to diminish Islamic terrorism by avoiding the simple truth.Radical Islam is a direct threat to the entire world! Whether they live in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, or Africa. It is Islamic killers who are the central problem on the planet. President Obama should acknowledge that today. And begin to correct his mistakes. And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.
