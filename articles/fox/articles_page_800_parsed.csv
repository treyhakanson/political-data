Illinois has $300 billion in debt. They are hundreds of billions of dollars in unfunded pension liabilities. How is sending illegal children to a war zone, because that's basically what Chicago is, how is that any better than where they are coming from? Fourth of July weekend alone there were 82 stabbings in Chicago. Rahm needs to focus on the high unemployment in Chicago, the crime, instead of pretending that he's Mother Teresa when we know he's not.JONATHAN HOENIG: I don't want to pay for them. Eric, Chicago is full of immigrants. It's the fifth largest Hispanic population in the country. These so-called illegals actually produce. They bus tables, they clean people's houses. A lot of Chicagoans want to hire them because it betters their lives. The problem isn't immigrants. The problem is paying for them and no one has a right to free housing like mayor Rahm is proposing. If the problem is paying for illegal immigrants, make them legal, problem solved.JEHMU GREENE: Absolutely, it is wise to be taking these kids right now. No doubt about it. For one reason. God bless us, we are Americans. These are children. We have done this before as a country. I absolutely agree with our colleague George Will, who on Fox News Sunday said that we have over 3,000 counties in this country. That would be around 20 children per county. This is something we can do. And on the broader immigration issue, if we did actually welcome all of the undocumented immigrants and make them legal, our economy would benefit by billions of dollars. By not doing it, we have lost $900 billion.WAYNE ROGERS: Well, I find this whole conversation somewhat depressing. I don't know how people -- my colleagues, all of you, how you can embrace something that starts with the word ""illegal"". You have nowhere to go. If they are illegal, they are illegal. If I suddenly say ""I'm going to take all the bank robbers in the United States and all the murders and make them legal,"" that's crazy. You can't have this conversation. In other words, we have in this country people who have gone through the process, legally, it's a discredit to them.REPORT: MEDIAN NET WORTH OF U.S. HOUSEHOLDS PLUNGES 36 percent IN PART 10 YEARSJONATHAN HOENIG: It doesn't have to be that way. There's no limit on wealth creation in a free country. There's no limit on jobs. There's no limit on a better quality of life for all. The problem is that, as you pointed out for quite some time, we haven't been a free country, especially when it comes to the economy. All the regulations and controls, all the interventions are forcing the economy that can't create wealth, and that's why all the things we talked about-whether it be HARP, Cash for Clunkers- all those things that try to help the economy have only added debt and retarded our growth.WAYNE ROGERS: I think you have to blame the congress. When you go all the way back to before the collapse in 2007 of the banking system. The thing is, Eric, the first part of that, 2002 to 2007, it actually o expanded. Most of that drop occurred after 2007, and most of it was related to the collapse of the housing market because that's where most people's net worth was. If you identify where it came from, it came from the depreciation of those values people had in their homes. If you go beyond that, you can't find a heck of a lot of decline.JEHMU GREENE: Well, Eric, I want to get away from republicans and democrats on this one because who do I blame? The people who sing that song ""for the love of money, you will steal from your mother, you'll rob from your brother."" Who is doing that? The folks on Wall Street. CEOs whose salaries have increased 800 percent in the last 30 years. Productivity is up, profits are up and how have they thanked their workers? Let's focus on the income part. Why aren't incomes growing? Because CEOs have not done anything to support their workers. Now back to politicians, conservatives say ""we are not going to raise the minimum wage"" which would raise all wages. First it's the Wall Street folks, second it's conservatives.MICHELLE FIELDS: It's not the republicans, it's not the democrats, it's the government. They are the ones who are standing in the way of this economy growing. The most economic growth that we have seen through this entire so-called recovery coincided with the government shutdown. We saw the same thing when Bill Clinton and Gingrich shut down the government; we saw economic growth. That's not a coincidence. When the government is shut down and there aren't tons of bureaucrats in DC taking money from taxpayers intervening in the market, that's when we see economic growth. It's not about raising the minimum wage, Jehmu. Get out of here with these terrible ideas.CELEBRITIES UNDER FIRE FOR BASHING ISRAEL'S WAR AGAINST HAMASMICHELLE FIELDS: I don't understand why these celebrities think just because they're famous that they're smart, and they should be talking about politics. Like you said, they should stick to their bad TV shows, their bad music. They should leave politics to us here on Cashin' In, and to the Cashin' In folks on Twitter.WAYNE ROGERS: I don't blame them, I blame the press. Why would the press go do that? You wouldn't go to a brick layer to get your teeth fixed, for God's sake. Why would anybody go to Hollywood celebrities and expect them to expound on foreign policy that made any sense? It's dumber than a box of hammers. I blame the press.JEHMU GREENE: Lord knows we don't need more pundits, but this is America. They have every single right to do that, and they're putting their brands on the line. So I think that says a lot about how seriously they take this. I don't understand why so many people think that just because you have makeup and a microphone, never worked in politics, that you have something to actually offer to the conversation. That's not just a celebrity problem.JONATHAN HOENIG: Some of them, I think Joan Rivers, for example have been on the right side of this. I guess that's what amazes me. How come so many celebrities are on the wrong side? You've got Israel, a Western, modern country committed to free speech, committed to gay and lesbian rights, committed to freedom and individual rights. On the other hand you have this tribal, Islamic savagery that is the Middle East. So I'm all for people having a political opinion, they should just have the right one and support Israel during this conflict."	['Israel', 'Clinton']	['god', 'creation', 'gay']

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Do you expect to endorse him?REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Yes. I think this is going in a positive direction and I think this is the first very encouraging meeting. But again in 45 minutes you don't litigate all of the process and all of the issues and the principles that we're talking about.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: No endorsement, but we are getting new reports of significant progress in the next phase of the Republican Party's effort to win the White House in 2016.Good evening and welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. It was billed as a critical meeting. The likely Republican nominee and the most powerful Republican in Washington. And Donald Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan came into this meeting with some very public differences. But tonight some of the folks inside that room are describing a meeting where both sides left happy. One of them is with us in moments, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus who helped arrange the get together and was inside the room today. Then we'll speak with former presidential candidate and Trump advisor Dr. Ben Carson. He is speaking to Trump's former rivals and there's some big news tonight on that front.But first, we begin with senior national correspondent John Roberts who is live in Washington, D.C. with the very latest. John?JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, good evening to you. What we're hearing from people who were inside those meetings is that Trump went a long way to either changing minds or at the very least easing the skepticism or downright opposition that many members of Congress have about him, his attentions and his policies. After the Senate meeting for example, Utah Senator Orrin Hatch who backed Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio offered Trump an endorsement but also gave him some advice saying, quote, ""Many constituents in my home state of Utah have serious reservations about Mr. Trump to help unify the party and broaden his appeal. I hope Donald will listen to policymakers and carefully consider his approach to issues like international trade, religious liberty and entitlement reform.""Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn did not endorse Trump but offer advice on his immigration policy saying, quote, ""There is a way to talk about the issues that isn't offensive to anyone."" But despite some lingering concerns, most senators at the meeting give Trump a big thumb's up. On the House side, Trump did what he came to do. Winning cautious praise from the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RYAN: This is our first meeting, I was very encouraged with this meeting.  But this is a process, it takes a little time. You don't put it together in 45 minutes. And so, that is why we had, like I said, a very good start to a process in how we unify.  (END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: Now, the question out of all of this, did Trump set the wheel in motion to create a waterfall of support for him in Congress. Early indications suggest that he did, but it will likely take some time for that to finally be realized. And Megyn, one other stop on Trump's itinerary today, a hastily arranged meeting with former Secretary of State James Baker, as Trump was meeting with House Republicans this morning, Baker was tearing a strip off of Trump's foreign policy proposals in a Senate Committee hearing under questioning from Senator Marco Rubio. Baker was particularly critical of Trump's positions on NATO and nuclear weapons in Japan and South Korea. Trump wanted a few minutes with Baker to talk things through and neither side we'll say, what they discussed -- Megyn.KELLY: John Roberts, thank you. Joining us now, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. Great to see you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being here. So, what do you think is the -- what are the criteria for an endorsement. What do you think Paul Ryan is looking for?REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Well I just think, you know, just getting comfortable. I think honestly that Paul believed, like a lot of people, that we all had another 30 days to kick the tires and at least go to California --KELLY: But what do you need to know about Donald Trump that you don't already know? I mean, what do you need to know?PRIEBUS: Well, look, I think an endorsement certainly in Paul's mind is an important thing. I mean, it's sort of like, you know, a public hug and vote of approval. And I think Paul takes it seriously. And I'll just tell you that everything you said leading up to the question to me was accurate.  Both Donald Trump and Paul Ryan left the room. I think they both expected a good meeting but I think they both left and were even more kind of impressed with each other leaving the room. There was far more agreement Megyn, than there was any disagreement. And there was also an agreement to keep talking, very quickly, to get to a place where everyone was comfortable. And Paul wants to get there and today was more than great start.KELLY: What does he talk about? Substance? Policy?PRIEBUS: Well, both. Both substance, policy. Our party and working together. You know, obviously I don't want to ruin it for everyone but I can't really get into the details. And then people can understand. If I'm going to be a good chairman and intermediary, I can't come on a show --KELLY: They won't let you back in any meetings. You can't blab.  PRIEBUS: Correct. Not a very good move on my part. But it was substance.  KELLY: But let me ask you this.PRIEBUS: It wasn't -- sorry.KELLY: This is what people say who think, oh, you know, Paul Ryan can never endorse Trump. This is what they say, you know, Trump favors a ban on all Muslims coming into the United States. Trump wants to deport all of the illegal immigrants who are here in this country. He wants a mandatory deportation force in fact. Trump wants -- he says NATO is obsolete. Trump says that the government is going to pay for health care in this country with some private system. But he said the government is going to take care of people. These are not Republican ideas. These are -- in fact they've been disavowed by most top Republicans. Does Paul Ryan needs assurances on things like those?PRIEBUS: Well, I disavowed some of those things myself. But I think Donald Trump understands that he's heading into the general election and I think he heard even on a couple of those items, you know, he's visiting those subjects again. And I think you saw some of that today. So, you know, look, I think we have a candidate that has brought in more votes than any nominee in the history of our party. But he's also someone who has never in his life run for public office. I mean, just think about that for a second. Never run for any public office and he's done pretty darn well.  And so, but he's also someone that understands that he's moving into a general election, he understands he wants to be presidential and gracious and focus on Hillary Clinton and how she's not a good answer for our future.  KELLY: So, how does that work? So, given that, given his win, you know, and the amount of votes he has, how does it work? Does he have to move closer to the party platform on these issues, including for example Planned Parenthood which he says does wonderful things or do you need to move closer to him? Because he's the one with the votes.  PRIEBUS: Well, look, first of all, I think you got to ask Donald Trump that. But I can answer for the party. The party is the party and we're here and you know as far as our platform is concerned, it's not going to change. And so I just think that Donald Trump brings to the table something that at least for us is something very different. And if we're being honest with each other, the same old way that we've been doing things in running for president hasn't worked out very well for us.  KELLY: Correct.  PRIEBUS: So for all of the smart people out there that think they know what's best for everybody hasn't been working. And it's nothing new. I mean, we haven't really want a presidential race --KELLY: You're talking about yourself really.  PRIEBUS: Well, listen, look, I support the nominee, Megyn. I mean, there are 17 candidates. Whatever candidate was going to be the chosen candidate I would support. And so that's what I've always said I was going to do --KELLY: But what happens in July --  PRIEBUS: Moving into doing.  KELLY: What happens in July? Because the Republican Party like the Democratic Party has a platform. And it includes, you know, being pro- life. They don't favor exceptions for race or incest. So now you're going to have a nominee who is going to come in. And he is not going to be in line with the platform. Does that matter? What if the nominee doesn't match up with the platform?PRIEBUS: Wait a second. I mean, I hear what you're saying. It's a good question. So, I'm not critical of it. But John McCain and Mitt Romney and both bushes, they didn't line up exactly with the platform either.  KELLY: It doesn't matter. They tonight need to.  PRIEBUS: Yes. It does matter. It does matter, the point matters because there's -- I don't know if anyone lines up 100 percent with the platform of the party. I mean, the point is, do you agree with 80, 90, 95 percent of it.KELLY: Uh-hm.PRIEBUS: And I think we're there with that. I mean, it's like Ronald Reagan said my 80 percent friend is not my 20 percent enemy. We don't expect 100 percent purity but we expect that for the most part, for a vast majority of your positions line up with our platform and I think he does.  KELLY: Fascinating. Continue to watch it. Mr. Chairman, thank so much for being here.PRIEBUS: Thank you.KELLY: Well, at the same time Trump was meeting with Republican leaders, Dr. Ben Carson announced he's reaching out to Trump's former rivals in the presidential race hoping they will support Trump. That includes frequent Trump critic, Senator Lindsey Graham. Senator Graham announced earlier today that he had a 15-minute phone call with Trump about national security, a call Graham described as cordial and pleasant. But just last week Graham said, Trump, quote, ""Did not have the judgment to be president.""Joining me now, Dr. Ben Carson. So, this is interesting between Graham and Trump. I mean if Trump can get Lindsey Graham to support him, it will be an epic reversal. This is, you tell me, Dr. Carson. This is from Lindsey Graham. If we nominate Trump we'll get destroyed and we'll deserve it. It will tear the party apart. It will divide conservatism, well, you know what I mean. It will be the third term of Barack Obama. He's unnerving, he is pathetic, he is worse than Obama. He'll get annihilated. He's a jackass. A nut job. A loser. I mean, if Trump can get Lindsey Graham on board, he's doing pretty well.  DR. BEN CARSON, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, you know, during the heat of the campaign people say all kinds of amazing things. And then they turn out being buddies. I'm sure you remember, you know, the whole voodoo economics between Bush and Reagan --KELLY: Well, I remember him saying, you were a child molester too.  CARSON: Exactly. So, you know, if you get caught up with those things, you're not going to get very far. That's the politics today and the politics of personal distraction. You know, you notice that I didn't get into it. But the fact of the matter is, the Republican Party is coming to understand that they cannot sit on the sidelines and allow Hillary or whoever to take control and get two to four Supreme Court picks which will fundamentally change America from what it is. Everyone will eventually come to that conclusion. It takes some people a little longer. That there are wounds that have to heal. I understand all that. But I think they're intelligent people and they understand what the consequences of sitting on the sidelines are.  KELLY: But do you really -- I mean, for the record, Senator Graham said my position remains the same regarding both candidates running for president but then he says, I'll do what I can in the Senate to help the next president who will inherit a mess. So, it sounds like he's not getting close to endorsing Donald Trump but he's accepting, you know, the outreach and willing to talk. But what about rivals like Jeb Bush with whom things got so personal, like Ted Cruz, you know whose wife was attacked by Trump.  Do you see any chance of those guys coming on board? I mean, Jeb has already telegraphed, no.  CARSON: Well, you know, I would love to see a situation where all of the candidate comes together in a room without a press and we talk about the things that we envision and how we expect to get there. And look for the things that we have in common and agree to work together. After all, this is our country that we're talking about. And we're talking about the future for our children and our grandchildren. We've got to be able to get over our own personal feelings. It's about more than any one person. If people can just come to understand that, we'll do just fine as a nation.  KELLY: What about, I mean, you know, what they say is that the back and forth they had with Trump are not just about their feelings, it revealed the character of a man and in some cases they say they cannot support that character. And it's more for some of these guys than just the personal attacks on them. It's his reversals, it's his positions on policies that they feel are -- to conservatism. I mean, how are you going to get past that in trying to recruit these guys into the fold?CARSON: Well, one of the things you have to understand is that Donald Trump is not a politician. He doesn't people like a politician. And, you know, politicians learn how to polish everything and say it in a very nice, little neat package. He doesn't know how to do that. I hope he never learns how to do it. Because that's the way normal people are and it resonates with them and it's going to make a big difference in the long run. And the political establishment just needs to understand that this is a new day. We need a new day. We can't continue going down the same road.And you know, maybe it's a little risky moving with somebody who never has been in a political office. But I don't know how it's much more risky as what we were doing earlier. And I think the American people have come to understand that. And if we can just utilize some of the experience of Lindsey Graham and some of the others in a positive way to make sure that we're successful, we'll be just fine.  KELLY: I cannot leave without reliving this moment. Because it was one of the most epic moments of the campaign. Remember, Lindsey Graham had given Donald Trump --CARSON: That was funny.KELLY: -- his cell phone number and then this happen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So Lindsey Graham says to me, please, please, whatever you can do. You know, I'm saying to myself, what is this guy, a beggar? He's like begging me to help him with ""FOX AND FRIENDS."" So, I say okay, and I'll mention your name. He said, could you mention my name? I said, yes, I may. And he gave me his number and I found the card. I wrote the number down. I don't know if it's the right number. Let's try it, 202-(bleep). I don't know, maybe it's, you know, three, four years ago so maybe it's an old number.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Which then led to Senator Graham posting -- yes, it was the right number. So, this was a problem for him. And I'll leave you with a tease, Dr. Carson. Something related to this is discussed between yours truly and Mr. Trump in your sit down that airs on FOX broadcast network next Tuesday at 8:00.  CARSON: We're looking forward to it.KELLY: We'll going to leave it at that.CARSON: Should be fun.  KELLY: It's great to see you, sir.  CARSON: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: While Republicans try to draw up support, there were new leaked documents today regarding Facebook and whether the social media giant has a bias against conservatives. How could this play leading up to the November election. We'll show you what the company said in its own words.  And then see what the ""Washington Post"" decision to target Donald Trump with almost two dozen reporters may actually end up helping his campaign.  We got some news on this today. Is it true? Are they really using two dozen reporters?We'll tell you when our power panel joins us next. Stirewalt, Dana Loesch and Shapiro, next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: By the way, the world's most dishonest people are back there. Look at all of the cameras going. Look at all of those cameras. Unbelievable.  They are dishonest, most of them, not all of them, but most of them.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new fallout from a statement by the ""Washington Post"" that has generated some controversy. Same journalist Bob Woodward revealing this week that his paper, under the leadership of the new owner Jeff Bezos plans to seriously increase its coverage of Donald Trump from here on out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOB WOODWARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: The ""Washington Post,"" we have 20 people working on Trump. We're going to do a book and doing articles about every phase of his life.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Chris Stirewalt is our Fox News digital politics editor, Ben Shapiro is editor-in-chief at DailyWire.com. And Dana Loesch is host of ""Dana"" on TheBlaze TV. Good to see you all.DAN LOESCH, HOST OF ""DANA"" ON THEBLAZE TV: Thank you.KELLY: So, the post basically came out tonight and said, look, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn't give us our editorial direction, we run our paper. And we're going to cover both of these candidates aggressively. That is what we get paid to do. Stirewalt, do they have a point?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, yes, they have a point. And certainly they have a point that the Washington Post has been stepping it up, been very aggressive, coverage, both sides and also once the primary is in, yada, yada, yada. However we also know that thing that happens where after the Republican gets out of the nominating process they come out with giant machetes, with the hacking. And Mitt Romney cut a guy's hair and it would, da-da-da-da. So, this certainly go, if you're enough of a conspiracy theorist to believe that there was a plan or there was an intention to wait until the general election to start really unloading the stuff on Donald Trump in the establishment press, well, this would certainly go to that point.  KELLY: What do you think Ben? Ben, you look like you're at a lineup. I don't know where we have you tonight. Right?(LAUGHTER)BEN SHAPIRO, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILYWIRE.COM: Listen, this is where Donald Trump is going to put me after this election if he wins the presidency.  KELLY: That's better. I see it like a flowerpot behind you. What do you think? I mean, do you think this is a case of the media holding back because we have been told by a lot of folks during the Republican primary, the media as soon as Trump get gets it, if he gets it, they're going to unleash hell on him?SHAPIRO: I mean, I do think that the media has been holding back. But I think this is a reality TV show that's far beyond what they can control at this point. I mean, today's Ryan/Trump meeting was basically the bachelor with Reince Priebus playing Chris Harrison. And the only question was whether Ryan was going to give Trump a rose or whether he was going to offer him a night in a fantasy suite. I mean, this whole thing is so far beyond the realm of natural politics. And I'm not sure the media can control it. And what do they hit him with at this point? He's done everything publicly. He's been in every scandal imaginable. And unless you catch him with a horse or something. I'm not sure exactly what the --(LAUGHTER)STIREWALT: I want out.KELLY: Okay. Out, out, out.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: Dana, what say you? Because if the past elections are any guide, none of these mainstream news outlets is going to go too tough on Hillary Clinton. Oh, Stirewalt, he's out. He's out. He's gone.  (LAUGHTER)LOESCH: He left. It was too much for him.  I am just -- I was pleased to see I guess good for them that they're making enough money where they can hire 20 people to cover one candidate, Megyn.  I guess, that's good for them. I guess the news business is going well.  But here's the thing. When do they ever do this for a Democrat? When do they ever do this for Barack Obama? And are they going to do the same thing for Hillary Clinton? Are they going to hire 20 people for the Hillary beat? Are they going to go through all of her e-mails?KELLY: Yes. That's the question. But the other question as you pointed out, Chris, is what does it matter? I mean, he has been the Teflon, Don.  It's not like nothing controversial about Donald Trump happened in the past ten months.STIREWALT: Right.KELLY: It's the Republicans at least, or at least some huge number of Republicans don't care.STIREWALT: Well, and not only that, the truth has been -- and I think Ben made a very good point, not about the fantasy suite but about the part where today this was covered like the papal visit to Washington, D.C. It was pen to post coverage, a lot of it very breathless and for the political press corps standing outside, is he here? Is he there? What did he say?  On and on and on.  KELLY: The countdown on MSNBC. The countdown clock. Look, look, CNN with the shot of Trump's plane. Wolf Blitzer was walking us through the plane's progress on the tarmac.  LOESCH: I'm shocked they didn't have a hologram. I was waiting for the Trump hologram. That was like -- that's the next thing that comes. Right?  KELLY: You will decide it was the second coming. It was, go ahead, finish your point, Chris.STIREWALT: Just if Hillary Clinton thinks that she can break through this news cycle with a snapchat video, it's not going to happen. She has got to figure out some way because if he can own the media space in the way that he did in the primary, she's hosed. She's got to find a way to break this.  KELLY: Ben, one of my favorite things tonight was an MSNBC banner that read, breaking news, Trump gives thumbs up heading into meeting.  (LAUGHTER)SHAPIRO: What the hell is going on here? I mean, they're treating him like he is some sort of J.D. Salinger -- loose and you can't find him anyway. So difficult to find him. Keep the cameras on at all times.  Let's Donald Trump escaped from our eyes. I mean, you have a guy who is blowing on a ram's horn, he's not even Jewish holiday or something, he's blowing on a ram's horn and singing odes to Trump outside the Ryan meeting.  And the media are covering this like it's news. I mean, it's unreal.  KELLY: The bag piper there which was reported on, the bag piper there, look. This was reported on, look. With (INAUDIBLE). With Trump inside the RNC. Okay. So, you can see the issue here. Pipe player. I do want to say, it wasn't just the other networks. We also had an eight bucks at some point. And MSNBC's defense, there was a day here at FOX News when I was a reporter near the D.C. Bureau when I saw the following, FOX News alert, the White House Christmas tree has arrived at the White House.(LAUGHTER)None of us has perfectly clean hands. Great to see you all.  LOESCH: Thanks, Megyn.SHAPIRO: Good to see you.KELLY: Also tonight, Senator Harry Reid unloading after Donald Trump meets with Senator Mitch McConnell.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. HARRY REID, D-NEV., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: REID: Since Senator McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, we can only assume he agrees with Trump's view that women are dogs and pigs.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Uh-hm. Is that line of attack in a work? We will investigate, next.Plus, new reports out tonight on Kelly Ripa, Michael Strahan and what is happening on the set of that show in the final days before Strahan leaves.  Kilmeade is here.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, 2016 moment today on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It came when Harry Reid took to the microphones to react to a meeting between Donald Trump and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REID: Since Senator McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, we can only assume he agrees with Trump's view that women are dogs and pigs.  We can only assume that the Republican Leader is not repulsed by Trump's vulgar behavior towards women.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now with reaction, Tucker Carlson, co-host of Fox and Friends and editor-in-chief of The Daily Color along with Bill Burton, former Obama White House deputy press secretary. Great to see you both. So Tucker, is that going to work?TUCKER CARLSON, ""FOX & FRIENDS"" CO-HOST: Well, I mean, it's part of the basic Hillary campaign theme which is elect me as the first woman. If you don't like me, you're a sexist. There's some truth in what he's saying. There's no defending some of Trump's comments. He said a lot of piggish things. Obviously, I'm for politeness by the way and I'm not going to defend them. But I will say it's one thing to attack an individual, but it doesn't make you a critic of all women or a hater of all women. I think Lena Dunham's kind of awful.It doesn't diminish my love for my wife or my three daughter so, it's kind of a ludicrous attack on that one. I mean, also by the way, voters know this. They know that Donald Trump has said things and they're short of making their calculation on the base of that knowledge already. It's not like a surprise. And finally the question that hangs in the air, okay, he's got an unusual personal life. Is it really weirder than Hillary's personal life? Do you want to have a contest of who's got a stranger personal life? Probably not. Better stick to the issues.KELLY: Bill?BILL BURTON, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I think that Tucker is mostly wrong here in the sense that I don't think that...(Laughter)BURTON: ...I mean, look, this is a big problem for Republicans in the sense that Donald Trump has said some amazingly incendiary things not just about women, but about Mexicans, about Muslims, about a lot of folks and if people are -- you know, Republican voters chose Trump to be their nominee but it was the choice of members of Congress and candidates to choose to support Donald Trump. They didn't have to, but if they do, they are going to have to answer for whether or not they support (ph) Trump on some of these things.KELLY: But does it mean Bill that you support everything he's said and done?BURTON: I think that that is a question that those candidates and Republican members of Congress are going to have to answer. Because if you support Donald Trump people are going to want to know why and they're going to want to know how on earth you can support somebody who said all of these things and who thinks all of these things about women and minority groups.KELLY: What about that...CARLSON: I have the answer.KELLY: You know how the interviews are going to go of these candidates in the House for example, who have endorsed Trump. You know, I went over with Reince Prebus at the top of the show. Do you support a ban on all Muslims? Do you support a deportation force? Do you support this kind of language about women? Do you think that Planned Parenthood does wonderful things? You know, that's how it's going to go.CARLSON: I mean, the hilarious thing about this line of argument is the opposite actually of the truth. The congressional leadership, they said that supporting Trump is doing so at gunpoint. He ran against them. I mean, he only exists because they failed. He doesn't like them. They don't share a lot of the same beliefs in fact they hate each other as everybody knows.So, the idea that they're sort of welcoming him with open arms, no, he's been forced on them by their own voters I would say. And the other point of course to make is that a lot of these policies horrify NPR listeners and you know uptight white liberals, but they have a lot of support in the country. I mean, what is the argument against securing the borders. It's not racist to want to have secure borders. Every normal person does and yet we don't.KELLY: Not as much as securing the border. It's stuff like deportation for us, right, and what does that mean?CARLSON: Well, I don't know. I mean, it's not a massive leap to say if there are people here illegally and you believe they're taking jobs from Americans and you can make that case. It's not a crackpot or friend (ph) case to make it all. There's some numbers actually to back it up. Then, I don't know.People who break the law should leave. I mean, I don't know, it doesn't mean you have to round up every person but that's not time (inaudible). He hasn't expressed it well, but the idea isn't like a Nazi idea. It's like a pretty basic idea, you know.KELLY: What about it Bill because, you know, all of these issues are at play but, you know, we saw the Quinnipiac poll this week that showed him within two or beating Hillary in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida.BURTON: Yeah, look. I think that Hillary Clinton is going to win. I think she's going to be the next president, but I don't think that this is a slam dunk. I think that there are some of these issues that are going to have to be aired and litigated and I think Tucker is right. Some these things do have support out in the country.And if you look at battleground polls particularly in close congressional districts, there are going to be arguments to be had. But Donald Trump is not just talking about building a wall, he's calling Mexicans rapists and he's calling Mexicans rapist, and he's calling -- he said that we should ban Muslims. Like these actually are fairly radical ideas and I don't think that they have broad based support.But there are corners of America where they do have support. And the thing that's going to be tricky for these congressional candidates on the Republican side is that they can stand with Trump and alienate independent voters and left-leaning conservatives or they can push themselves away from Trump and they can risk alienating Trump supporters. So for them, they've got a real math problem.They can't put together a coalition of voters that's going to be able to get them over the top ain some of these close districts and that's where I think you'll see the impact of a Trump candidacy.KELLY: Great to see you both. Thanks, guys.CARLSON: Thanks Megyn.BURTON: You too, Megyn.KELLY: So, I got a chance to visit ""The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon"" earlier this evening and he stole a little video on the way out. Sorry, sorry Jimmy. We're going to give you a little preview of ""The Tonight Show"" tonight when you have to turn over there 11:30 and watch.Plus, Facebook taking new fire about a bias against conservatives after some damaging company documents turned up today. We'll have them for you next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Young 20-somethings often Ivy League educated or from private East Coast school are the ones that are sorting through the news feed and determining what people are able to see and more importantly what they're not able to see.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight. The head of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg is tonight responding after days of damaging reports that the folks managing the news feeds there at the social media giant have a bias against conservatives. It comes on the same day that some damaging documents turned up in a newspaper. Trace Gallagher has the details.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, again today Facebook denied instructing any of its employees to suppress conservative news or news sites. When asked how they protect against bias, Facebook responded quoting, ""We have a series of checks and balances in place to help surface the most important popular stories regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum."" But critics argue bias is built into Facebook checks and balance system and here's why.Facebook relies primarily on ten news sources, BBC, CNN, NBC, USAToday, Yahoo! The New York Times, Washington Post, The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal and Fox News Channel. For Facebook to list a story as nationally important, it has to be the lead story on at least five of those websites. Conservatives would argue most of those sites are left leaning. So, a story important to liberals is likely to be on five of those sites.But a story important to conservatives like the IRS scandal or the Benghazi investigation would certainly be on Fox News but not the other sites. And despite a Facebook executive saying, ""we do not insert stories artificially into trending topics."" Facebook's own documents show that editors are taught to inject stories getting attention like Black Lives Matter and to blacklist other stories for a variety of reasons. In fact, three former Facebook news editorss told the Guardian newspaper at their discretion, they inserted stories to make the experience more topical.And this all becomes even more important when you consider 60 percent of millennial's and 40 percent of baby boomers get most of their political news from Facebook and the statement you just mentioned, Mark Zuckerberg came out tonight saying this whole matter is being fully investigated and how he's now invited conservative leaders to meet with him to get their input about that topic, MegynKELLY: Trace, thank you. Turning me now with more, senior editor at the Daily Caller, Jamie Weinstein. Jamie, good to see you. So, Zuckerberg came out this thing what we just got and he said, look we have found no evidence that this report is true. He says we're investigating it but he says so far, they've investigated it and they have found this is not true, that they're injecting more liberal stories and removing more conservative ones.JAMIE WEINSTEIN, THE DAILY CALLER SENIOR EDITOR: Well, there are certainly allegations that contradict that. But even if that is true that there's no active bias in what they're saying, the sources which they draw from, as was just mentioned, by that very definition or by their very nature will exclude stories like the Planned Parenthood videos.I don't think that got much national coverage on five of those ten sources that they say they draw from. Maybe Fox News but not the others so, that will be excluded from the trending topics and that has a major effect.KELLY: That's an interesting point, but do you think that's done by design. I mean, it's no secret that I've said publicly I believe that there's a left leaning bias in most of the mainstream media and I think it exists in a way that's in some cases almost latent in the minds of those who make the decisions. They believe they're fair but they don't even understand that it's their bias driving the editorial choice.WEINSTEIN: Well, I think there's two segues to this or two possibilities. One is that it's blatant and we might see that in the allegations that they kind of took topics down like stories about CPAC or Glenn Beck and took them away from returning topics.KELLY: Lois Lerner.WEINSTEIN: Right. Exactly. Mark zuckerberg denied that was the case. But this is kind of the latent what you suggested were they might not even realize the bias that's going into it, but you know, they only hire people that are kind of liberal in nature which we see in the media generally, you know, you hire people of like mind. So you only go to the sources that they think are objective but are not covering stories that are significant. I think to everybody, but particularly to conservatives.KELLY: Right, because what they're saying is while we have human beings who will put up a story if we can see that it's not getting the attention it deserves. It's not getting picked up by all these websites but it's a real story generated by the people, and the example they gave was Black Lives Matter. But then of course that begs the question wwell, did you do that for the Tea Party Movement?Did you, you know, you need a real person -- do you do that about Darren Wilson? You tell his stories when he got exonerated by the DOJ. Once you inject a person's editorial decision into it, that's why, that's what news organization do. We're all human beings, but it has to be disclosed and you have to have protocols in place to make sure that it's going to be fair and balanced.WEINSTEIN: Right. And I think the key point is transparency here. They're claiming that this was just an algorithm before all of this came out. There was very little human reaction. Now, we know there's much more human reaction than they suggested to begin with. And again, 600 million people view the trending topics every week on Facebook. To some people, that's the only place they get their news. So, this has the power to shape and break candidates. So, it's very important that Zuckerberg is transparent in this and I'm glad that he's getting conservatives to come in to talk.KELLY: Well, maybe he'll invite you. Maybe he'll invite you. You're a young conservative.WEINSTEIN: I'm willing. I'm out here in Silicon Valley.KELLY: All right, well, there you go. I'll skip (ph) for you.WEINSTEIN: I'm out here in Silicon Valley so, yes.KELLY: Great to see you Jamie.WEINSTEIN: Absolutely. Nice to see you.KELLY: Also tonight, we have new reports of what's happening behind the scenes with Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan. Plus, a sneak peek of an eye opening conversation with attorney Robert Shapiro. This is going to air on our special on the Fox Broadcast Network next week, Tuesday at 8:00. And the best video you'll see next week when Brian Kilmeade joins us next. Look, puppies and babies.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, for several weeks a lot of drama has been unfolding on the set of ""Live with Kelly and Michael"" and it all culminates tomorrow when Michael Strahan departs as the show's co-host. He's going over to join GMA full time. Joining me now, Brian Kilmeade, co-host of Fox and Friends and host of ""Kilmeade and Friends"" on Fox News Radio. So, TMZ added to the drama today and I know you -- this cannot be good for you because you host ""Fox and Friends"" now you're going to be competing against somebody who you really like.BRIAN KILMEADE, ""FOX & FRIENDS"" CO-HOST: Yes, true but he's going to ""Good Morning America."" He's going to join a cast of 900 people. So, it's kind of -- I don't think he fully realizes how early he's actually getting up...KELLY: Oh, look who's on ""Kelly and Michael"" this week.KILMEADE: I watched that appearance. It was excellent.KELLY: Thank you.KILMEADE: And you know what I also noticed? Michael Strahan didn't get a question in. It seems as though -- did you notice that?KELLY: I think there was one.KILMEADE: Yeah, there might have been one. So, it was two great pieces, but the story behind the scenes is I've got to know Michael Strahan since he broke in with the Giants. He was one of those guys you walk in the locker room and actually know your name and he'll look back at you and you can tell this guy is unbelievably talented.But the word is, they weren't getting a long for a while and that he was looking to jump because the tensions been great and according to two sources close to him, part of it was he'd like to bring his friends in, his guys in and have a good time and kind of be loud. She didn't really like that behind the scenes and maybe that started to wear on him in the big picture.KELLY: Can I tell you something. Let me just say this for the record. So, having been the subject of multiple news reports this year for reasons that are familiar with our guest, I can tell you this, most of them are total B.S. They just make stuff up about you. So, you have to take all of thos with a healthy grain of salt.KILMEADE: Okay, all right. If you want to do that you can do that. I talked to people that were there if you want me to...KELLY: Get where it leads, go on. You're way bad (ph).KILMEADE: People Magazine is about to do a story and it's coming out -- it came out a few hours ago and it's going to actually hit the press if anyone picks up anything on the presses anymore, but it's going to talk about Kelly Ripa talking about what she wants in the next co-host, ""Someone who's comfortable on the set with me and somebody I can trust.""KELLY: Are you angling? Is that -- you were looking into the camera and making the doe eyes.KILMEADE: As you know, I'm already very happy with two fine co-hosts who hopefully will not talk to People Magazine or Megyn Kelly.KELLY: All right, I want to talk about what on earth is going on at Oxford. Trigger warnings now for the students -- the law students.KILMEADE: Yeah, Oxford is a four-year college in England.KELLY: Thank you.KILMEADE: Thank you. No, it's an excellent school.(Laughter)KILMEADE: It's so daily now (ph) and they write this story that at Oxford now, they're telling law students, criminal law students, before we talk about a homicide or a brutal murder or anything that could be ugly for you or make you uncomfortable, we're going to give you a trigger warning. So, you as a law student, a criminal law student get to leave the class and they continue to study this for a week. You get to stay out of class.KELLY: I can't -- I can't even. So, basically these students are going to have to learn about murder cases and so on without ever actually learning about murder cases and so on.KILMEADE: Guess who's to blame? America. Because we have started with the safe spaces, we have started with the -- the sensitivity. Absolutely, the book that you might get a chance to write.KELLY: One of these days.KILMEADE: But here's the story, when america sneezes, the nose runs in England. See, I made that up.KELLY: Beautiful.KILMEADE: So, you can use that tomorrow and claim it as your own because no one's watching Thursday. They will watch Friday. I think this is incredible, but it's good news. There will be perfect attendance for the shoplifting classes rose (ph) to loitering. No one can realize that (ph).KELLY: As long as that's your crime you committed, then you can hire a lawyer who graduated from Oxford, otherwise you're clear.KILMEADE: Yes.KELLY: Get one from Albany Law School. We don't need trigger warnings. Robert Shapiro is part of my special on Fox Broadcast Network on Tuesday. That's American idol class, 8:00 p.m. Tuesday. Here's a clip(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: There are a lot of people who are not lawyers, look at lawyers in particular, criminal defense attorneys and say, how can they live with themselves and this man in the mind of many committed two brutal murders and you and the dream team got him an acquittal. So, I ask you that question, how can you live with yourself?ROBERT SHAPIRO, O.J. SIMPSON DEFENSE LAWYER: Lawyers have an obligation to do their best for somebody accused of a crime and that's how our system works. Our system of justice is one that's balanced. We hope and pray that innocent people are never convicted and the price we pay is that guilty people sometimes do and will go free.(END VIDEO CLIP)KILMEADE: I like him. I interviewed him for a book I was in. He was portrayed well by John Travolta but not accurately. I thought he got raw deal. Not everybody thinks that he actually is the guy who's sucking up to Hollywood stars and everything like that. I thought he had want to cut a deal very clearly and he wasn't able to, and then it ends up getting out of control.KELLY: And he will make news on that. He also tells me what O.J. whispered in his ear after the verdict. So, that's reason enough to tune in Brian. Thank you sir.KILMEADE: Pleasure. Good to see you.KELLY: We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Five days away from my brand new show ""Megyn Kelly Presents"" airing on the Fox Broadcast Network, and tonight Jimmy Fallon will have me on to discuss it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIMMY FALLON, ""THE TONIGHT SHOW"" HOST: I want to talk about this thing because there's a big -- there's a big special coming up, primetime special and you're interviewing a bunch of people but one of the -- who are you interviewing for this special?KELLY: So, Donald Trump. He maybe there.FALLON: Yeah, I was going to end with Donald Trump. You guys didn't really get along, I mean, have you talked before?KELLY: So, we didn't -- mostly through twitter.FALLON: Yes, exactly.(Laughter)FALLON: mostly one-sided.KELLY: We did not talk for a long time and then I reached out to him in April and asked him if he would do this.FALLON: So, you reached out to him after the debates. You guys didn't really talk.KELLY: Well, I mean, there had been -- there was a lull in the tweets.FALLON: Yeah.KELLY: And, you know, I had wanted to go speak with him. I wanted him to stop and I knew if I could get face to face with him he would stop, you know. I think -- I don't what his motivations were for the whole dustup but...FALLON: You went to see him. You went to Trump Tower?KELLY: Yeah, I contacted him and asked if he would see me. First he said no and when I asked again he said yes.FALLON: Really.KELLY: I went down there one morning and walked into Trump Tower and got past a bunch of eyeballs that was as big as saucers.FALLON: Yeah, like, what is she doing here?KELLY: Honesty, the doorman was like, ""Oh, hello.""FALLON: I'll let him know you're on your way.KELLY: Hello, how are you?FALLON: Hello Mr. Trump, she is here. The one who must not be named.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Our special also has exclusives with Lavern Cox, Michael Douglas, Robert Shapiro.
