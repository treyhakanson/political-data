This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ANDREA TANTAROS, GUEST HOST: Senator Rand Paul took a big stand against the renewal of the Patriot Act last night by holding a 10-plus-hour filibuster on the Senate floor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My voice is rapidly leaving. My bedtime is long since past. And I think it's time that we summarize why we're here today and what my hope is for the future with this issue.We need to end the bulk collection of records, but that's not where this battle ends. There still is a question of whether or not the executive is gathering a great deal of information through executive order.  I think that has to be reviewed. It has to be reviewed in public.(END VIDEO CLIP)TANTAROS: Joining me now is the man leading the fight against the Patriot Act and the NSA surveillance program, the author of the upcoming new book out on May 26th, ""Taking a Stand: Moving Beyond Partisan Politics to Unite America,"" 2016 presidential candidate, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.The senator is now asking Americans to join his fight against the Patriot Act. How are you doing this, Senator, and what are your chances of actually getting rid of this piece of legislation?PAUL: Well, you know, I think public opinion does have a big influence, even in Washington. If people go to RandPaul.com, we'll help to relay that message to Washington and we'll help to let people know that what we really would like to see is that the government has to have your name on a warrant.This is what our Founding Fathers fought the revolution over, is that the government shouldn't be allowed to have a blanket warrant or generalized warrant to collect all of our records. And so I think if we have enough influence and enough people go to RandPaul.com, I think we can have an influence. Already, they said they weren't going to give us any amendments. Now it looks like maybe we will get to amend the Patriot Act.TANTAROS: Senator Paul, you're a potential contender for the White House Jeb Bush was asked about what you are doing and he intimated that you're operating from a separate set of facts. And of course, he's defending his brother's legislation, but he said there isn't a shred of evidence that anyone's civil liberties have ever been violated. How do you respond?PAUL: Well, I think the violation of our civil liberties is in the collection of the data. We're not alleging that the people who work in the NSA are bad people, that they have bad motives, that they're unpatriotic.  We're just alleging that the government on occasion has historically abused the rights of citizens.We did it during the Civil Rights era to Civil Rights leaders. We did it during the Vietnam era. We did it to Japanese-Americans during World War II. So the danger is in letting government collect so much information.And also, the danger is that the 4th Amendment, which our founders were very proud of, said they have write an individual's name on the warrant, and that if you write the name Verizon and you collect all the records from the company Verizon, that that's not a very specific way of doing things, it's not individualized, and you are not going after people we're suspicious of, we're just going after everybody's records. And that's an invasion of privacy.TANTAROS: Yes. And Senator Paul, for me, I mean, I fear you get the wrong person at the helm in the White House, and all of that data -- not only is it too much for them the comb through so it might not be useful -- but they could use it against Americans if you get a potentially corrupt president.Senator Paul, thank you for joining us.PAUL: Even now.TANTAROS: Yes. That's right. That's right. Senator Paul, good luck with your effort. Thanks for joining.PAUL: Thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" May 8, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: A live look now at the House floor, Washington, D.C. We are waiting for lawmakers to go ahead and vote on this Benghazi select committee.We are told some Democratic leaders want their party to vote against this whole thing. But then what happens if it becomes a Republican-only affair? It will still issue a report. It will still do its investigations. What do Democrats do?To Congressman Charlie Rangel on how he sees this playing out.Congressman, good to have you. What do you think of this thing? Do you think Democrats should support it, should sit on it?REP. CHARLES RANGEL, D-N.Y.: I think it's a great idea.I thought they were going to have a select committee on affordable care, because it appears that they have given up on that. And now they're going to have a select committee to study what we already studied.I think it's tragic that the Republican Party would destroy itself in 2016 by not having one issue that the American people believe should be a priority. That's sad because...CAVUTO: Well, I just -- could you answer my question, sir, about whether you think Democrats should be a part of this committee, because it looks like it's going to happen one way or another.RANGEL: Not -- the only time -- we cannot be a part of having the majority on a select committee where we have not the control to see which direction it's going.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: So, no seats at all, no seats at all? You wouldn't -- there are some who are worried that it might boomerang on you, that no representation at all on that committee doesn't even afford you a chance to challenge some of its findings.RANGEL: At some time, you have to be on principle. And participating in a farce, even if you're trying to fight it from the inside, let them do it from the outside.Let the American people decide whether or not they think we should have participated.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Do you think we have gotten all the answers, though? Does it bother you, as a decorated Korean War hero in your own right, that there are a lot of things...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: But there's a lot of things that we don't know happened. They might not be nefarious. They not be -- but we have never gotten straight answers.And now e-mails that seem to conflict with original statements, why not have a committee investigation? Why not clear the air once and for all and decide whether this is all political hay or not?RANGEL: Are you really telling me that you have no confidence in Darrell Issa, who has had all of these hours and days and weeks and months investigating this, that now you're saying you have no confidence in him, so you have to bring in a new member to ahead up a new committee to find the answers? Is that what you're saying?CAVUTO: How many committees looked into funding and improprieties and lies and faulty intelligence into the Iraq War?RANGEL: We're talking about Benghazi.Now, if you want to change it and talk about Iraq war, we can do that.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: No, no, no.But, no, look, just think of this, Congressman. If the argument then, and Republicans said was just you guys making a big deal over bad intelligence, and you say now the argument in this case, arguably on a much, much smaller scale, is arguing over faulty intelligence, then why not be consistent?RANGEL: Let me tell you this.I don't want to see the Republicans destroy themselves. I don't want to be an American with just one party.CAVUTO: Well, were Democrats destroying themselves during the whole uproar over the Iraq War?RANGEL: I don't think people, Americans, Democratic or Republicans, are going to sleep over Benghazi.And I really think that they're concerned about the economy and jobs and immigration. What I'm talking about is, is that if the Democrats are the only ones standing on their feet in 2016, America has lost.CAVUTO: But leave the politics out of it. What's to -- what are you telling the families of those who died that you think has been exhaustively studied enough, when they just want simple answers and they still don't know? What are you telling them?RANGEL: I'm telling them that I can't leave the politics out of it, if the Republicans are going to set up a select committee to dance on the graves of those people who died.CAVUTO: So, how are we going to get answers? We're just not?RANGEL: Well, you're saying that Issa, Darrell Issa, can't get the answers you want, where he has the majority on a standing committee?CAVUTO: All right.RANGEL: Is that what you're saying? And suppose we can't get it with the select committee?CAVUTO: OK.RANGEL: Do we set up another committee?CAVUTO: All right.RANGEL: Do we have 51 committees?CAVUTO: All right. Congressman, I wish we had more time. I don't mean to jump on you. That's it. We're hitting a hard break.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 12, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld is back. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five."" Hillary Clinton took heat for calling Trump supporters deplorable. And now Bill Clinton is probably not helping things by saying this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: The other guy's base is what I grew up in. You know, I'm basically your standard redneck.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: The former president also took aim at the Fox News Channel viewers. He recounted a moment during the primary when the Clinton camp knew they couldn't hold West Virginia.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)B. CLINTON: I went down to West Virginia to talk about this, because she said there's no way we can carry it. Now I said, I said, no way. I said you know that at first of all, they only watch Fox News.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Now, I think that he meant that as an insult.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: It wasn't.PERINO: But he calls himself a redneck basically.GUTFELD: Yeah -- no. It's actually, if you think about it, it's a compliment because he just said all of Trump's supporters are capable of becoming a two-term president, because he grew up with them. So that, I don't think he meant it as a compliment but it actually could be looked that way. Look, Bill Clinton is lucky. He has what's called the PPP, which is called the Progressive .KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Oh God.GUTFELD: . you know, the Progressive Pig Pass, as long as you are .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: . a progressive leftist .GUILFOYLE: Lies are covering.GUTFELD: . you can get away with it. You can get away with anything. That's why you remember that the staunchest defenders of Bill Clinton, during the sex scandals were feminists who target the accusers like his wife had done, and imply to everything was consensual. It's because as long as you are progressive and you're on this political side of a feminist, you can get away with anything. And that means denigrating entire groups of people targeting women because, you know, they, they had sex with your -- your husband. As long as you are for feminism and for empowerment, you can do whatever you want as he has proved.PERINO: It is kind of irresistible for a lot of people on the left, Eric, for them to denigrate Fox News viewers or Fox News hosts and things, even though they would like to come on the show some time especially when they write books.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hmm. Very good.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: So I also think it was a compliment.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: I don't think he meant it as a compliment, but I certainly rather would be a redneck than a limousine liberal or redneck than a intolerant liberal or a left-wing nut, that said that's just me, but -- but I -- he is getting pushback because he is lumping all the group as a certain type. He is typecasting the whole group. And as you know, when you do that you can be considered racist, sexist, Islamophobic or whatever. Moving on, months ago I said they should pull Bill Clinton off the campaign trail and they should. He fought with a marine. That was bad for her. He called --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: Yeah, he called ObamaCare this crazy system. That was bad for her, and now this .PERINO: I think he was right.BOLLING: . is going to be in term. Bad for its time to pull him back or if you know, if you are a GOP republican, keep him just what he is doing.PERINO: Right. And he is very popular, Kimberly, amongst democrats and actually I think he's kind of one of those characters that because he has like charisma you are drawn to watch him and listen to what he says. I don't necessary think he's a huge drawback for Hillary Clinton, but I'm sure that her campaign, every time he goes out they might just hold their breath to see what the tapes are gonna send back.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. It's like the gas gasp. Feel like, OK, what's going to happen next? But he is popular. I mean he really is. There are people, republicans that like him, too, you know, in certain circles. But when he goes into a crowd, whether it's a small room or a big room, he knows how to work it. He's always been a very good politician and knows how to get it done. He's more popular than she is. That's the thing. So, you know, obviously, they're going to try to use them, because they're down to Al Gore, Climate Gore, you know they've got a few people. They've got Tim Kaine. I don't know how much good he's even really done her to be quite honest. He didn't do a good performance during the debate. But, so you see with something like this, like they're going to put him out there. He is a former president, so he is still a resource. But all of this information that's coming out is just -- there's such a huge spat. They're like, poof! Whoa! It's like cramming the night before thing the exam. They're so much to like, where do you even get started going through the list and the litany? And as for redneck, look, I like guns, I like religion, I like my beer with a lime, so you know. And I like men who work for (inaudible).PERINO: Like countrymen band players, guitar players?GUILFOYLE: Yup. We do.PERINO: We like them. We do. Juan, is it hard for Bill Clinton to be both a former president and a statesman and a partisan trying to help his wife get elected to the presidency?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: No, I think he's a big fan of his wife. I think he was --PERINO: No, I know. But I mean like in terms of he has -- as a former president, you have -- that comes with some responsibility or I would say some ability to sort of be up above partisan politics, but when he goes out on the campaign trail, he ends up making a statement like this -- would seems to be.WILLIAMS: And by the way, I think the statement is totally being misinterpreted by all of you.PERINO: About Fox News viewers?WILLIAMS: No, no, no. What he said was, he is saying to his audience, I mean you can read the transcript, he says, ""Tell them I want them to be a part of America, to feel included, to not feel isolated .""PERINO: I agree with that, right.WILLIAMS: "". or pushed to the side."" That's what Bill Clinton was saying. And then he comes back and says, quite explicitly, ""We need people. We want them to feel that they are part of America."" And if they're not being, somehow, you know, shown or demeaned by the conversation that's going on in the Democratic Party. That's what he was saying.BOLLING: It's like basket of deplorables?WILLIAMS: Basket of deplorables. By the way, she was right. But I'm just going to say .PERINO: Well --WILLIAMS: . I just think on this one --GUILFOYLE: That's not very nice.BOLLING: Right about what?WILLIAMS: She's right that some people who have very harsh attitudes about blacks, about gays, they have deplorable attitudes, OK?BOLLING: She, she said half of Trump supporters are a basket of deplorables.WILLIAMS: She apologized for saying half. She did not apologize for saying deplorables, because I think there are some people who have deplorable attitudes on the far right.BOLLING: Sir, there's deplorables in every organization, in every group.PERINO: But they said --WILLIAMS: Well, fine. Then you agree.GUILFOYLE: Every part.WILLIAMS: Fine.PERINO: And because --WILLIAMS: But I'm saying in terms of what Bill Clinton said .(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I don't know.WILLIAMS: . that Dana is talking about .BOLLING: I would say that half of the people have voted for Trump, it was somewhere -- what they have, 20 million votes? 10 million -- 13?GUILFOYLE: I would never say that she was right .PERINO: Thirteen.GUILFOYLE: . and their people are deplorable and also --WILLIAMS: There are some deplorable people in this world.GUILFOYLE: . irredeemable. That's not very (inaudible).WILLIAMS: But I'm just saying in terms of this segment, what we're talking about with Bill Clinton said was very clearly, ""Tell people who are,"" you know, as he said grew up with him in rural Arkansas, wherever he's from.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: They are part of America. We need them. We want them to progress. And when he was talking about West Virginia, he pointed out he won West Virginia twice.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: And then he said. That's why I don't believe we can't -- Hillary Clinton goes to (inaudible).PERINO: No, and that's true. I mean there's a reason why George W. Bush and his election effort and the re-election in 2004 went back to West Virginia .WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: . over and over again because it was on the cusp.WILLIAMS: Correct.PERINO: I think now it's reliably a red state for now, but it could change.GUTFELD: The unspeakable truth here is that Bill Clinton would be a Fox News viewer if he wasn't married to Hillary.PERINO: He might be a Fox News viewer.GUTFELD: If you remember, if you remember the mid '90s, I mean when you think about how the country is shifted --GUILFOYLE: Are you saying that for obvious reasons?GUTFELD: What? I don't -- I didn't hear you.GUILFOYLE: Why Bill Clinton would be a Fox viewer?GUTFELD: Because he's a -- he was reliably center right in the '90s. And I think that there are more -- he has more in common with Fox News than probably CNN or MSNBC. But if I were Hillary, I would send him to Club Med for the rest of the month in a small country, make it clothing optional to save him the time of packing.PERINO: Well, that would be -- that's a good way to take carry-on luggage .GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: . and not have to pack a bag. There's another controversy that swirling today. I'm going to try to set this up and we're going to talk about it. It's regarding some WikiLeaks e-mails that were released and, in particular, this conversation between two Hillary Clinton staffers about Catholics. And whether this is true or not, I guess, remains a question. But here is, apparently what the e-mails that were released said, basically saying that, Catholics to have a bastardization of the faith. They're totally unaware of Christian democracy, social acceptable politically conservative religion; that they don't know what the hell they are talking about when they talk about Thomistic -- it gets a little bit complicated and detailed. You can read these e-mails. We'll have them for you on our Facebook page. And they have been talked about all day. Now Greg, the Catholics has a voting bloc but you are -- you grew up catholic .GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: . but you do not profess to .GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: . be a part of it anymore. So Jennifer Palmieri, the -- one of the staffers on this says she does not recognize the e-mail, she, in fact, I think that we have her on tape saying that earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENNIFER PALMIERI, DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR 2016 HILLARY CLINTON PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: I'm a catholic. I don't recognize that e-mail that we saw. We're not going to fact-check each of the e-mails that were stolen, hacked by Russian effort and then take my (inaudible) effort and an effort to her campaign.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So we have a situation with WikiLeaks continuing to put out a whole bunch of information.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: WikiLeaks, which is basically finding -- hacking e-mails, releasing them. The campaign saying that they don't know about it and the Catholics saying, ""This is actually a deplorable to do to the catholic religion."" What do you make of all that?GUTFELD: All right. Well, it's two different stories, number one. Does anybody really believe this is coming from WikiLeaks? WikiLeaks is the receptacle. That's like a child who thinks money originates from her dad's wallet. It doesn't. It's being sent to WikiLeaks and then WikiLeaks release it. If it's Russia it's something that we, as a country, should be concerned about it. Just because it happens to target a candidate you don't like, isn't enough for me, because when they are done with her, they're going to come after everybody else. And if you work in industries - let's they are fact that the left believes affects the climate, if you work in the oil industry or automotive industry, you could targeted for this. That's the first part of the story. The second part is, in general, religious people are seen as freaks by the media because the media is so detached from them. I have been on both sides. I, you know, Catholic for 12 years and so on. But I can tell the base in the media, generally they see people who are religious as Martians. They don't understand it.PERINO: The interesting thing as I look back on some of the numbers and so, Catholics as a group have not voted for a republican as a majority since 1984 and the Trump campaign did jump on this today, I think trying to say, look, this is -- this how they talk about you behind closed doors. Do you think they can turn that around with the Catholics?BOLLING: Yeah. So -- first of all I'm gonna say I'm a Christian, I'm catholic and I'm highly offended by the comments, highly offended by practicing every day. I think what they -- the theory was and I think what they were going for was to divide and concur. Let's divide Catholics from evangelicals or divide Catholics as a subset of Christians who are bastardizing Christianity. That's highly offensive and I think this is gonna blow up in their face. I think if you're on defense, if you're undecided and you're Catholic --even if you are Christian and not Catholic, you have to take offense to this. Here is why. When -- if President Clinton, Hillary Clinton is going to stack the Supreme Court and the federal judicial system, will your religious freedoms come under attack? A lot of Catholics and a lot of Christians believe that under Clinton they -- that may become an issue at the supreme court level. I would say this is a negative for Hillary Clinton, big time.GUILFOYLE: I saw Father Jonathan Morris speak on Fox about this and he was very, you know, passionate and eloquent talking about the importance of freedom of religion and what we see happening throughout the world, and you see genocide against Christians. And this is a time that the United States should be leading and protecting faith and religious freedoms with everything that we have in our constitution. So these e-mails, I think are very damaging. I do not believe her when she says she did not send them. I think it's convenient for them to say and blame it on the Russians because that ties Trump into Putin. It's clever. But I don't, I don't believe it when I hear her say it and I saw her saying it -- I don't know. It just seems very convenient. The WikiLeaks went through and edited how many, 20,000 something plus e-mails, maybe even more. It's a bit much to swallow. So, I just -- yeah, as a catholic, too I mean, you know. But this is not really a surprise to me when --GUTFELD: You don't think the Russians are involved?GUILFOYLE: I don't know if it's Russians or the Chinese or --GUTFELD: Doesn't that bother you?BOLLING: That did not --GUILFOYLE: You know, the North Korean --BOLLING: That did not have to know.GUILFOYLE: Of course it does.BOLLING: I think that said is --GUILFOYLE: Of course it does.GUTFELD: It bothers me that it is another --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Let's get Juan --GUILFOYLE: It bothers me if it is somebody here doing it.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Well, let me just tell you, this is such a bizarre conversation because she didn't write the e-mail. The e-mail comes to her from a guy who is interested in the relationship of Catholics and politics .PERINO: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: . and especially big donors and the like. And, and he is saying this, Jennifer Palmieri didn't say it. Nobody in the Clinton campaign says it. Then she responds and says something about, ""Well, maybe these folks who are becoming Roman Catholic don't want to become evangelicals because their rich friends wouldn't understand it."" That's all what was said. So all this stuff about I'm deeply offended and all this gonna explode .BOLLING: Yeah, highly offended. How is it if somebody says something racist to me Juan?WILLIAMS: There is zero. Zip. This is --BOLLING: I say number one .WILLIAMS: This is not racist.BOLLING: . that's racist, I walked of it -- walk out of conversation.WILLIAMS: This is not anti-catholic.BOLLING: I don't continue the conversation with the racist.WILLIAMS: You, you are missing the point here Eric. This is not anti- catholic.BOLLING: Really?WILLIAMS: This is simply saying -- and we have these freedoms in our country, if you have a difference of perspective or theology .PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: . you can express it and you can say, hey, somebody is playing a social status game in terms of saying they are, they are comfortable becoming a catholic as opposed to becoming an evangelicals. It's almost saying, why they doing that, because if they are truly really having this kind of conversion, why don't they become an evangelical? So I don't get -- I mean you guys, it looks to me like you are trying to find something, something, to give something to Trump or some reason to find .GUILFOYLE: No, but he has a right to be able to --WILLIAMS: . grievance with Clinton.GUILFOYLE: He has a right to be able to say if he finds that offensive --WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying. But she --GUILFOYLE: . relation, just like I do.WILLIAMS: But let --GUILFOYLE: Just like --WILLIAMS: But let just be clear.GUILFOYLE: Just like you had (inaudible)BOLLING: If someone walks in --WILLIAMS: He said Jennifer Palmieri did not write it.BOLLING: If I'm having a conversation, a cup of coffee with someone on the corner who happens to be .WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: . throwing out racial epithets left and right.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: You see him -- and I stand there and continue this conversation, you walk by .WILLIAMS: That is so different.BOLLING: . don't you say, ""Bolling, what is wrong with you? Why would you walk away .WILLIAMS: This is so different.BOLLING: . from that guy?WILLIAMS: There were no epitaphs.BOLLING: No, she --WILLIAMS: The man was expressing .BOLLING: No -- really? Because I feel --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Because I feel -- I feel being called bastardizing Christianity. It's a Catholic.WILLIAMS: It wasn't bastardizing.BOLLING: Highly, highly offensive.WILLIAMS: He never said that.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Did you know that there is a key difference that someone has to make clear at the end of the segment.GUILFOYLE: Go ahead, Greg.GUTFELD: OK. Religion is a set of ideas.WILLIAMS: Right.GUTFELD: OK? Religion -- any religion whether it's Islam, Buddhism, Catholicism, you name it. It's a set of ideas. It's not race.WILLIAMS: Thank God.PERINO: And it is --(LAUGHTER)PERINO: It is - so he -- nobody on her campaign actually wrote the bastardization (inaudible) --WILLIAMS: No.PERINO: That was someone from outside. So we can --WILLIAMS: Right.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Thank you.BOLLING: I'm not suggesting she wrote it.PERINO: Right.BOLLING: I'm suggesting that was the comment that was made and Palmieri, whoever it was. The campaign continued an e-mail conversation with someone who was saying highly offensive things to a group that I'm, that I'm part of.PERINO: All right. Coming up, did WikiLeaks reveal a major case of mainstream bias? New e-mails suggest journalists are coordinating with Clinton's campaign. We will have details next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: New allegations of mainstream media corruption and collusion after thousands of e-mails are leaked from WikiLeaks about Hillary. First, Bill O'Reilly exposes the media is in the tank for Clinton. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL O'REILLY, ""O'REILLY FACTOR"" HOST: I think everyone can agree, except for the media organizations that now have ordered their employees to destroy Trump, there's at least three of them. And I can't say who they are right now, because I don't have it nailed down, but I am a hundred percent convinced. And these media organizations have actually bit put out, if you support Trump, I'm going to -- your career is done here. All right. And that's how intense it is. News organizations have sent -- not officially, but through the, you know, corporate grapevine that we don't want anybody supporting Trump. And you know, if you study it, you can see which ones they are.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Well, if there's any question about media bias towards Hillary, we have a few examples from WikiLeaks. Former CNN employee now interim DNC head Donna Brazile sent an e-mail to Clinton's Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, raising concerns about a question slated for CNN's town hall the following day, says quote, ""From time to time, I get the questions in advance. Here is one that worries me about HRC."" Now Brazile denies that allegation. In other e-mail, Podesta debate moderator John Harwood of CNBC wrote, quote, ""I imagine that Obama feels some sad indication at this demonstration of his, of his year's long point about the opposition party veering off the rails. I certainly am feeling that way with the respect to how I questioned Trump at our debate."" KG, I want to start with the Donna Brazile. From time to time, you get some information, news organizations says, ""Hey, we have this information but it's embargoed until 6 o'clock. It's embargoed until 8 o'clock. It's embargoed to at this event happens. And as a personality, as a journalist, what opinion-maker, we hold the information. It's on us to do it. I have a real problem with Donna Brazile sending the question that ended up being asked by the moderator -- Ronald Martin, the very next day at the town hall, almost word for word, she sent it along to the Clinton campaign.GUILFOYLE: Yes. Well, that is the allegation Donna Brazile has to be fair as released the statement saying that she, in fact, did not do that, would not do that --.I mean I know her a little bit. Dana knows her better, but obviously any suggestion like this, whether it's Donna Brazile or someone else, you know, trying to help or give a leg up to a campaign by feeding information would be inappropriate, would not be the right thing to do ethically speaking as a journalist. So it's one of the things that's flagged in some of this, whether you see it's collusion between DOJ or between other media personalities or entities that sort of basically feeds into the Trump narrative of what he has been trying to say about the crooked media, the mainstream media. That is three against one. We saw that in kind of in the debate.BOLLING: Dana had just called POLITICO writes you this exact story, talking about -- and she shows the two e-mails. One from Roland Martin and the one from the Donna Brazile forwarded to the Clinton Campaign and they are word for word with the same .PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: . capitalization, almost the same punctuation.PERINO: So, I don't know and -- what happened here specifically. I have not spoken to Donna, but she and I are very good friends. I would add this. So Donna Brazile, it's not unknown to people that she -- before she was took over as chairman, she was both the vice chairman of the DNC, while at the same time a CNN contributor, while at the same time a Georgetown professor, while at the same a public speaker and she also has her own company.GUILFOYLE: Many hats.PERINO: She has a lot of different hats that she wears, OK? It's not like she was running the 4:00 p.m. newscast at CNN. CNN is very comfortable having specific spokes people for particular candidates on their network talking specifically about those campaigns. And I am sure, because we have seen it on CNN before with these particular people. They talk directly to the campaign, especially Donald Trump. We see that with Corey Lewandowski. And I don't know if that means that anybody actually gives Corey Lewandowski information (inaudible). I actually kind of don't care. But I do think that we hold political journalists and opinion makers to a different standard than journalists. I think we do that here, we do that newspapers all across America. That happens. So I agree this probably -- this does not look good. I don't know in the big scheme of things if we should be that shocked, because if these two things are going to be combined and that's going to be allowed, you could expect this could probably happen. It's one of the reasons I don't do any republican events.BOLLING: I still have a problem with it. I still have a problem with almost the exact wording being forwarded to the Clinton campaign in a day prior before the town hall. Am I wrong? I actually think Donna Brazile should step down at as a DNC chair.WILLIAMS: Why?BOLLING: I think it's completely unethical. She -- when you are told to embargo stuff, you, you embargo it or --WILLIAMS: Well first of all .(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: . she says she didn't do it, but secondly .(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: No, I read it. I read it.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But what I'm saying is she says she didn't do it. But the key here is -- I think what Dana said which is, CNN hires Corey Lewandowski from the Trump campaign. They are paying him while the Trump campaign is still paying him. Then you see that Donna is known. Donna -- it's not as if Donna, unlike Lewandowski doesn't say, ""Oh, I'm not vice chair of the DNC. She was, very clear, who she was and what she was doing. But the second point is this. If she then gets a note or something from, I think it was from Roland Martin about a question or is .BOLLING: That's the same question.WILLIAMS: . she there engage in discussion --BOLLING: That's the exact --WILLIAMS: I heard it.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: If I could finish, I will. I -- that Roland Martin is talking to Donna Brazile about a question. And Donna says to these people, ""I have concerns about this question."" Is that in her mind forwarding? She said she didn't do it. But in my mind that would be a violation .BOLLING: It was forwarded.WILLIAMS: . to some kind of the journalist to extend.BOLLING: It was forwarded to the campaign. Roland Martin was the questioner on the CNN town hall the next day.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: He didn't work for CNN. My problem is with the, with the personalities, not the network.GUTFELD: Well, I mean --WILLIAMS: CNN, by the way, said that they didn't do it.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: They didn't.WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: It's like; it's like getting polling results that are embargoed until 6 o'clock.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: We don't talk about it. We wait until 6 o'clock.GUILFOYLE: We would be electrocuted if we take threat (inaudible).GUTFELD: That they are -- I mean the real big question is why does this bias occur? Because the same type of person, generally, who enters a media career is the same person who has liberal leanings. There are studied that show that. The conclusion is, if you want to change this, it is time for conservatives to infiltrate. I mean we need more conservatives and more libertarians in this vocation. It's been a liberal playground forever. And it needs a total renovation. I, I avoid the WikiLeaks stuff. You know why? Because I think it's an -- it's immoral to go through people's e-mails. You don't have to look at WikiLeaks to find liberal bias. You all have to do is go, go to TMZ reported, which actually it's fairly accurate that NBC planned to use the Trump audio to influence the debate and the election. OK, that is kind of a big deal. They dropped it at a certain point. That's not WikiLeaks. You don't have to go to WikiLeaks to find this stuff. The media -- now if that, if there was damaging audio of Hillary, would that, would a network have dropped it? Probably not. The media targets --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: The media targeting a liberal would be like a parent booing their own child at little league.BOLLING: There you go. We got to leave it right there. Up next, continuing our decision .(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: Hillary being held accountable. Clinton's camp may have been colluding with the Justice Department on her e-mail investigation. New details when we return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Stunning developments in the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. Newly-released documents from WikiLeaks show a Clinton campaign insider appeared to have discussions with sources inside the Justice Department about ongoing open records lawsuits regarding Hillary's e-mails.In an e-mail from May of 2015, Clinton's campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, said, quote, ""DOJ folks informed me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge's thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today.""Trump hammered Hillary about the scandal on the trail this afternoon. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Department of Justice fed information -- think of this -- to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation. So that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes.This corruption and collusion is just one more reason why I will ask my attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor.We have to investigate the investigation.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. So Dana, is this something that works and resonates, based on the information we're getting?PERINO: Well, for his crowd, for Donald Trump's rallies, they will love it. They will eat it up. I have to say, though, having worked in a situation where you have investigations of public officials and you're dealing with the Justice Department, that I don't know who Brian Fallon spoke to, but DOJ folks -- one of the things that we had to do with the U.S. attorney scandal, for example, which was really a bologna scandal. I wish I was press secretary again and could go back and do that one over. There was a designated person, a lawyer, who was designated for both parties to talk to, which acted as sort of the neutral party. That to me makes total sense and is proper and is fine.The thing that is funny to me about this is that one of the things -- one of the e-mails says that her communication team -- and maybe not just communications -- believed that the e-mail story that had just broken would be over in a weekend. They thought it was going to be no big deal. And it has actually been the biggest deal of the campaign. Even Bernie Sanders couldn't stop it from being a big deal.GUILFOYLE: No, for sure. It mattered to his supporters, and we still see in the polling that...PERINO: Definitely.GUILFOYLE: ... when you asked people in the exit polling during the primaries...PERINO: The e-mails.GUILFOYLE: ... it matters. The e-mails definitely resonated with people. So -- which gave rise to the whole Crooked Hillary Clinton type of moniker.All right, Bolling, so what do you make of this? Collusion?BOLLING: I don't know. I mean, I don't know enough about it. I honestly can't. I'm trying to figure out what actually is the accusation.I do think that staying on the e-mails is important, and I think the FBI made a mistake in suggesting they were done with the case. I would like to see them continue investigating. Because I think, as you keep pulling at the string on the sweater, eventually it unravels. And I think there's more there.Again, there's a reason 33,000 e-mails were Bleach Bitted to oblivion. They can never be brought back again. There's a reason, because they wanted to make sure those were never seen.Now, there's enough stuff in there -- you realize somewhere in between what they got rid of, stuff that's innocuous, and some of the stuff that we're talking about that they didn't get rid of, they couldn't get rid of and we still find highly concerning, that means the stuff that they got rid of had to be even more concerning. Because there's a lot of stuff that's inane that they left in. So whatever these 33,000 is -- I mean, we're speculating on it. But in about 27 days, you elect a president. Do you want someone that would go to that extent to hide some of the information. There's got to be...GUILFOYLE: Despite a subpoena in place. Yes, despite the subpoena in place. That's problematic.All right, Greg, so how do you see this? Do you think this is something that works?GUTFELD: Well, again, I'm going to go back to what I always say: I don't like commenting on purloined e-mails, because it's going to happen to FOX News, as well. Just get used to it. This will happen. Julian Assange has no partisan love for us. So it's not like, you know -- once he's done doing this, he'll do something else.Having said that, you can talk about the e-mail situation without WikiLeaks. Because the fact is, it's the same argument that we've always had is that you can't trust someone with national security when you can't even trust them with classified information on their e-mail.BOLLING: The difference here, though, Greg, is those e-mails are supposed to be held in case they were ever subpoenaed. That's the difference between...GUILFOYLE: That's what I was saying.BOLLING: That's the difference between them breaking into the State Department server or e-mails and a private person's e-mails.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: We're not talking about her, ""Hey, what are you doing this weekend?"" We're talking about what did she do as official business?GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Again, WikiLeaks didn't break in.GUTFELD: The idea that -- I just -- I don't know. I just find it interesting that, if it were another team sport -- if it were -- if it was one of the -- if it was a politician that we liked, we would be screaming outrage.GUILFOYLE: OK. All right. Juan, so do you think this is something that her campaign should be worried about, because obviously, Trump is making hay out of it on the campaign trail?WILLIAMS: He makes hay with his folks who are looking for any reason to demonize Hillary Clinton.GUILFOYLE: How about this?WILLIAMS: But the fact is that this was -- Brian Fallon, by the way, used to be the spokesman at Justice. So he's communicating with people he knows about what is going to be a public hearing.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: And it was public knowledge of a public hearing. So it's not exactly any secret. But Trump and anybody else that's trying to drum up some drama can do it. But this is really thin gruel for a candidate that, it seems to me, has bigger problems with his own party.GUILFOYLE: Me, instead, I prefer Irish oatmeal. It's delicious.All right. When we return, the gloves are coming off. With only one week to go before the final presidential debate, Trump and Clinton are slamming each other harder than ever. The latest battle from the trail next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: We're just one week away from the election's must-see event, the final presidential debate. It will be moderated by our very own Chris Wallace, fair and balanced. That's next Wednesday night right here on the FOX News Channel.Ahead of the big showdown, the rivals are not scaling back on their attacks on each other. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The WikiLeaks e-mails show that Hillary Clinton's staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile. Smile, Hillary, smile. Smile. Smile. Do you believe it? Smile. Let Hillary Clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way I talk and let's see how long she lasts.HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: His campaign -- his campaign said today that they are going to use a, quote, ""scorched-earth strategy"" for the remaining four weeks of this race. Now, that just shows how desperate they are. That's all they have left.You do have to feel a little sorry for them. They've had a really bad couple of weeks.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Greg, this anticipation for this debate comes at a moment when it looks like Donald Trump is falling behind in the polls in all the swing states. So is there any reason why you think Donald Trump would say, ""I don't care. I don't want to bother with this debate""?GUTFELD: He knows this is important. This is -- means everything to him right now. I think his -- he has to strike the -- kind of the same tone he had last week, which was -- was it a week ago? I can't remember.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: I can't...BOLLING: Three days ago.GUTFELD: Years. But -- but I think that, you know, he's got to be -- he can't be restrained, but he can't be aggressive. He has to get in the middle.And he's got to stress one thing when they come after him: words versus deeds. That seems to be the most effective way of dealing with the attacks on him, to say, ""These are words. Here are her deeds."" And if he just sticks to that, that's great.I think it's awesome that only FOX News has the debate. I think that's incredible.WILLIAMS: Well...GUTFELD: Happy birthday to Quis [SIC] -- Quis [SIC].PERINO: Chris Wallace.GUTFELD: Quis [SIC] Wallace. Chris Wallace, who's 69 today.WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: Good for him.WILLIAMS: Happy birthday.GUTFELD: And Hillary is in leather.WILLIAMS: Yes. So Dana...PERINO: He took all my points.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: He took all your points, huh?PERINO: I have just one other thing I could add.WILLIAMS: Go.PERINO: Which is that Chris Wallace, as you know from doing ""FOX News Sunday"" -- you do it more often than anybody here -- he is the kind of person that you -- when he asks a question, you want to get the answer right. And he knows his stuff very well. And there are some specifics I think that Donald Trump could take advantage of.For example, this question of the new tax review study of her plan is that it would cost 700,000 jobs. I mean, there are specifics that he did very well in the second debate when he was talking about Obamacare when he drilled in on those. I thought that was some of the most effective. So that if he can have some of those in mind going into this debate, he'll probably do better.WILLIAMS: So Eric, one of the critiques that comes from the left is, ""Oh, he's just going to have the scorched-earth approach again. Why put that on TV?"" What do you think?BOLLING: Well, he's taking a page from her playbook. She's the one who invented scorched earth. The Clintons. Well, Bill and she has.So look, Greg's right. This is it. This is his final -- final act on Broadway. He's got to bring it or forget it. And don't forget: after that, you know, we're only a couple of weeks away. A few, whatever, two weeks away from the election.He also has to make sure -- he has to thread that needle, where it's not over the top, because he's got the brand to protect in the event he doesn't win the election. He's got to make sure he can go strong enough where you go ""I want to vote for that guy"" but not so strong where you go ""I don't like that guy after, if he's not the president.""WILLIAMS: Boy, that's an interesting point. And Kimberly, you know, I think as ""USA Today"" said, unprecedented, historic number of Republicans moving away. He has to speak to the base, as well.GUILFOYLE: He does. Yes, he has to -- I have 20 seconds, now five. Yes, so yes, he has to speak to the base. He's got to make sure, though, to bring some new people in. I think he wants to try to win this election badly. And I think he's going to go at her hard on Monday, because it worked well for him last time.WILLIAMS; All right. Up next, ""The View's"" Joy Behar lands in hot water over her controversial remarks about Bill Clinton's accusers. So is she sorry? Details when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: On Sunday, Trump invited women from Bill Clinton's old scandals to attend the presidential debate. The next day the ladies of ""The View"" got into a heated exchange about why Hillary didn't address her husband's sexual assault accusers during the event. The ironically named Joy Behar now under fire for her remarks. Let's watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To your point, which was if a woman sleeps with your husband, you're not going to necessarily embrace them. I wonder why she didn't have -- that's why when he brought up this -- these allegations, I wonder if she missed the opportunity to address it in a way that the public would understand, that that's just not how you behave.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The big issue...JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, ABC'S ""THE VIEW"": ""I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband."" Maybe she could have said that.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: After being criticized for calling the accusers ""tramps,"" Behar, saying she was kidding, which would have made sense if what she said was actually funny.Dana, from a communications perspective, should she be disciplined like Billy Bush was?PERINO: You mean fired?GUTFELD: Well, I don't know. Was he fired or was he...PERINO: I don't know. I don't know what the status is over there.GUILFOYLE: Suspended indefinitely.PERINO: Suspended indefinitely. Sounds like a pretty...GUTFELD: Calling victims of sexual...PERINO: She apologized.GUTFELD: ... tramps is not very nice.PERINO: She apologized, and I think that's probably fine.GUTFELD: OK, Eric.BOLLING: It's almost like saying the rape victim got raped because of the short dress.GUTFELD: Yes, yes.BOLLING: Blame the rapist, no, blame the victim. Look, she's a comedian. She can say these types of things. You have that umbrella that allows to you do that.GUILFOYLE: What would happen if he said it? The little funny one over here, what if he said it?PERINO: Not allowed.GUTFELD: Who are you talking about?GUILFOYLE: Not you.GUTFELD: And if you work for a company, they have a right to fire you for whatever reason. It's not freedom of speech.PERINO: If you say ""boo"" the wrong way.GUTFELD: Yes. Right, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Right. But I mean, so what do you think? I mean, do you think that it would be a double standard if a guy said it or if a girl -- I don't know.GUTFELD: If it were, Juan, if it were a -- let's say a Republican target who was targeting women, Joy wouldn't call the victims tramps, correct?WILLIAMS: If it was a Republican...GUTFELD: If it wasn't Bill Clinton, if it was somebody else...BOLLING: Donald Trump.GUTFELD: ... she wouldn't call the victims tramps?WILLIAMS: Oh, yes.GUTFELD: Probably a fair argument.WILLIAMS: You know, I thought -- I thought it was that she was saying that a woman, from a woman's perspective...GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: ... somebody who's messing around with your husband, that that woman is going to be pretty angry at that set of women. I guess that's what she meant.GUTFELD: But not all of them were voluntary.GUILFOYLE: These were -- yes, these were alleged sexual assaults, like rapes where there was physical injury that was alleged.GUTFELD: I think there was one -- there was one alleged. But even that has never gone to court. Nothing has ever been proven.But I think this was about -- this was on an emotional level, is the way I took it. It's like it's an emotional conversation about women who are messing around with your husband. I didn't think -- I didn't think it was in good taste, if that's the question.GUTFELD: If you look back at, in the late '90s, the staunch -- I said this before. The staunchest defenders to Bill Clinton were feminists. I mean, because he had the pig pass. As long as you're a progressive, you can get away with this.PERINO: That's where they came up with Move On.GUTFELD: Yes. That's right. MoveOn.org.WILLIAMS: Yes, indeed.GUTFELD: That worked. All right. On that note...PERINO: Twenty years later, we're still talking about it.GUTFELD: Yes.""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" I'll kick it off. Remember this song?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROD STEWART, SINGER (singing): Oh, Maggie, I could not drive any more. You made a first-class fool out of me, but I'm as blind as a fool can be.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I won't play the whole song. I won't play the whole song. I kind of feel bad. I feel like I'm sort of stealing Kimberly's Royal News, because the 71-year-old music legend Rod Stewart was knighted by Prince William in the grand old country of England.GUTFELD: You know that song is about Maggie Thatcher. Right?WILLIAMS: No.PERINO: No, it's not. It is about a relationship with an older woman, though.GUTFELD: There you go.PERINO: Did you know that? I mean, wow. He thanked Queen Elizabeth II. And if you see the pictures of his children, it's amazing. They look exactly like him. His wife was Peggy Lancaster. She was there with him. And it was quite a lovely event.All right. So...GUTFELD: There you go.GUILFOYLE: It's the cousin of ""Kimberly's Royal News.""PERINO: I don't have a nexio (ph), but nexio (ph) is you.GUTFELD: Don't use TV jargon.GUILFOYLE: Why not?PERINO: We're teaching people.GUILFOYLE: All right. Let's see if we can pull it together now, shall we? ""Kimberly's Food Court."" All right. Way to hit it. That reminds me of going to Vegas for the debate. So check us out, too. And yes, happy birthday, Chris Wallace. If you were here, I'd give you a taco.All right. So Yum brand, how appropriate the name. CEO Greg Creed -- also a cool name -- who ran Taco Bell for eight years was interviewed this morning. He dropped an amazing stat that we all are very interested in. Dana fed this to me. You like that? Pun intended. He claims about half of the U.S. population eats Taco Bell every month.PERINO: That's amazing.GUILFOYLE: I think it's fantastic. And that the average person goes there every 11 days. Well, it's also very affordable. And they've been working on very healthy ingredients.So I have some here to celebrate. Chicken for Juan. Chicken for Dana. Bolling is going out to dinner with his wife. Greg is starving himself, manorexic. I am not, so I'm having a beef taco. These are delicious. Last time I checked, how much are these? It's like 99 cents.PERINO: I have to tell you, they have improved on the ingredients.All right. Greg, you're next while we eat.GUILFOYLE: Well, that's delicious.GUTFELD: It's going to be a line at the port-a-potty.All right.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: ""Greg's Halloween Tips.""(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: All right. It had to happen. You know, whenever there's, like, a sudden celebrity, there's always a costume that comes up. In this case, remember Ken Bone? He was the real star of last week's debate. Now he has his own Halloween custom. It is officially called sexy undecided voter. It looks to me like some -- a server's uniform at a themed restaurant. You've got the red sweater and I guess -- and a mustache.Whoever came up with this was just dialing it in that morning, because this costs over 100 bucks.PERINO: Come on. You can get a sweater for less than that.GUILFOYLE: It's a yoga outfit with a mustache.GUTFELD: Exactly.PERINO: Eric is next.BOLLING: Very, very quickly. Because tonight, one of my favorite new shows, ""Designated Survivor,"" is on. So I want to go through what the designated survivor actually is. The presidential line of succession is the president, then the V.P., and then the speaker of House is third, and if he happens to be incapacitated like the rest, then it goes down to the president of the Senate, pro tempore, which is the highest ranking senator.And if all of these people are present and everyone else is present, there's always someone left aside, someone put in a secure...PERINO: Location.BOLLING: ... location away from the venue, such as the state of the union, the inauguration or joint -- joint House and Senate together with the president. So when that happens -- in any event, watch ""designated Survivor."" I think you're really going to like the show.PERINO: OK. Juan Williams, you're next.GUILFOYLE: It has Kiefer Sutherland. We love him.BOLLING: It's amazing. It's great.WILLIAMS: All right. So, as you might have guessed by now, I love space and all of its vast mystery. A big announcement for folks like me from President Obama this week.He wrote an article in which he says the government has agreed that, in the next two years, private companies will have astronauts based at the space station. That's the first step...PERINO: Wow.WILLIAMS: ... in a private-public partnership to get Americans to Mars by the 2030s. He says he remembers having sat on his grandfather's shoulders to watch people come back from earlier missions. Now he wants his grandchildren...PERINO: Bye, everybody.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Hughley speaks out about recent police shootings	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" July 13, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, President Obama in an attempt at a healing moment on race relations, may have fallen short again.  We'll get to the guest list at the White House in a moment.Welcome to ""The Kelly File"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Just a short while ago, President Obama finish meeting with law enforcement, elected officials and some Black Lives Matter activists from across the country. In a get- together that the White House described as a quote, ""conversation about community policing.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We're not at a point yet where communities of color feel confident that their police departments are serving them with dignity and respect and equality and we're not at the point yet where Police Departments feel adequately as supported at all levels.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: The meeting comes roughly one week after the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Minnesota. In both cases, national outrage was ignited, and racial tensions heightened and new anger at law enforcement took the form of protest across this country. The death of Castile, in Minnesota, even garnered a passionate reaction from Minnesota's governor, who questioned whether the shooting would have occurred had Castile been White.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. MARK DAYTON, D-MINN.: Would this have happened if those passengers or the driver and passenger were white? I don't think it would have. So I'm forced to confront -- and I think all of us in Minnesota are forced to confront this kind of racism exists.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Wow! Now after angry protests in a series of attacks on cops, including a deadly ambush in Dallas, Texas, new evidence is coming to light, and not getting much attention from the larger media about the two cases that, in part, resulted in this. And the folks leading the national debate, well, you'll hear about that, too. In a moment, we're going to hear from former L.A. Police Detective Mark Fuhrman, and radio host, D.L. Hughley.But first, we go to Trace Gallagher who has been following the latest developments in these cases -- Trace.  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And Megyn, we're going to play you dispatched audiotapes obtained by two Minneapolis news outlets that appear to show that a broken taillight was not the reason Roseville police initially pulled over Philando Castile instead one of the officers believed he was following a robbery suspect. Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery. The driver looks more like one of our suspects, because of the wide-set nose.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Castile's family says the tape sounds like racial profiling.  The lawyer for the officer who shot Castile says there was reasonable suspicion for the traffic stop and that the shooting had nothing to do with race and everything to do with the presence of a gun, but now Philando Castile's girlfriend has changed her story saying, the officer didn't know anything about a gun. Telling ABC News, quoting, he didn't ask about it.  He didn't know it was on his person. He came to the car. He said it was a traffic stop for a taillight and then he asked for a license and registration, that was it, that was all. But that was not what the girlfriend said on tape moments after the shooting. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DIAMOND REYNOLDS, PHILANDO CASTILE'S GIRLFRIEND: He's licensed to carry.  He was trying to get out his I.D. And his wallet out of his pocked and he let the officer know that he was -- he had a firearm and he was reaching for his wallet.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: The tape also has the officer saying, he repeatedly warned Castile to keep his hands inside. And now the Roseville police chief is slamming comments made by Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton claiming Castile never received medical attention. Chief Rick Mathwig said, he was given CPR, the chief went on to say that Castile's girlfriend and four-year-old daughter were also treated well, despite the girlfriend's allegations to the contrary -- Megyn.  KELLY: Trace, thank you.Joining me now with more, former L.A. Police Detective Mark Fuhrman. Mark, good to see you. So, this is what so often happens in these cases, is we see what looks like disturbing video, and disturbing facts and then there's a rush to judgment and I don't know what the facts are going to bear out in this Minnesota case. But you tell me whether, you know, why we're not seeing equal media coverage as some of the initial allegations appear to be falling apart.MARK FUHRMAN, FORMER L.A. POLICE DETECTIVE: Well, Megyn, I suppose, some of these media outlets are getting a lot of mileage out of actually starting a fire and then throwing gasoline on it. When they have a cell phone video, let's just take the Sterling case to begin with --KELLY: That's the one in Louisiana.  FUHRMAN: When you have that cell phone video, yes, I believe that that's actually was advantageous for the officers because it shows not only did they get a radio call there with the man with the gun. They identified the man. The man refuses to get on the ground. They taze him, and it's infective, they actually deescalate their force, and then tackle him and try to just grapple with him and get control of him and hand cuff him. He goes for a gun, one officer says he's got a gun, a shooting goes down. I believe that shooting is going to be not only in policy, there won't be any charges, state or federal, and that is just the way it's going to go down, I suspect, but that's my belief.Now we go to the Castile shooting. All we know in the Castile shooting initially is we see a wounded man or what we believe to be a wounded man in the car, and the girlfriend telling us what occurred. We don't know anything else. We see an officer standing by the window, but we don't know anything that preceded this, but yet they run away with, it had to be a racist shooting by the police.  KELLY: Uh-hm. How about that? Because I mean it was extraordinary -- listen. It's not that extraordinary in today's day in age to hear people.  You know, civilians watching it make that leap, or in the case on this show last week, the Reverend Jesse Jackson made that leap and said those cops are racist. But the Governor -- the Governor of the state coming out and saying, this is about racism is quite a leap, especially now that we know that there was a report of a robbery suspect.You hear the officer saying he believed he matched the description, and there are now several inconsistencies already that we know of already in the girlfriend's story including one in which she said, they kept her for six hours in the police station with access to no one and now we know in fact, it was only two hours and there are at least two other inconsistencies in the story that she told.FUHRMAN: Well, Megyn the girlfriend is either lying before or she's lying now. It doesn't matter which. She was lying one time or another and at the very list, she's completely confused and she knows nothing. But when you look at an officer encountering a situation, it's not profiling to look for a suspect that's identified in a crime, that's called police work. If he has a probable cause to stop this person and says ""don't move your hands,"" he moves his hands and he's moving towards what he sees to be a gun, that's a good shooting.It's going to be very disturbing for people of both these shootings turnout to be not only in policy, and the department but legal, and outside of a purview of a prosecution by the Justice Department. But those are the facts and that's the way it goes down. And I always find it fascinating, Megyn that everybody thinks they know how to be a cop but they really don't. That's like saying that, you know, you go to the doctor for a reason, you go to the doctor to have them diagnose you, you don't do it yourself and then operate on yourself. Well, the police are the same way.  It's a profession, and they're very good at it and they actually train and they're educated and it's constant training.But if I could just add this one thing, the people at large from the president, right down to the last citizen in the community, fails to realize one thing. Police departments concentrate their manpower in the most crime-ridden, most violent crime areas and those officers don't have a choice. Those officers are driven by a radio that tells them where to go, that a citizen in that community is saying ""I need help, this just happened, this person just did this, this person just shot them.""KELLY: Uh-hm.FUHRMAN: So this is not something the officers have a choice. They're trying to do a job that is almost entirely impossible.KELLY: Mark Fuhrman, thank you.  FUHRMAN: Thank you.  KELLY: Joining me now with reaction, D.L. Hughley, actor, radio host and actor of "" Black Man, White House: An Oral History of the Obama Years.""  D.L., thank you for being here.D.L. HUGHLEY, AUTHOR, ""BLACK MAN, WHITE HOUSE"": Thank you for having me.  I didn't know Mark Fuhrman was going to be here.KELLY: What do you make of that because you're shaking your head?HUGHLEY: I think that cops have a different perspective than us and I think it was interesting to hear Mark Fuhrman who was actually -- got in trouble for purging himself, calls somebody liars. It's ridiculous to me.KELLY: Uh-hm. But what do you make of the fact that she had inconsistencies in her story?HUGHLEY: I think the cop had inconsistencies, too.  KELLY: So then you let the, you know, you let the evidence play out, and jump to racism?HUGHLEY: It is my belief. And no matter what happens, no matter what we see, the cops are given the presumption of innocence, that saying tapes show, the suspect is doing something, that would be all the prosecution would lead. They would see the evidence is all right here. But a cop -- a presumption of innocence, that is, no matter what they say, we could see somebody getting shot to death, we don't know what happened before, we don't know what happened after.I know this that in states, in both of these states, a lot of men in Louisiana, 47 percent of people carry guns. Men carry guns. So men having guns on them, why wasn't the first question, rather than assuming, do you have a permit for that? Those are states that you can carry a gun.  KELLY: But you're making assumptions because we don't know what happened.HUGHLEY: No, no.KELLY: We have right now is her testimonial, which doesn't capture the actual event. Do we know whether she's credible? Do we know whether --HUGHLEY: We know this. We know he had a permit to carry a gun.  KELLY: But that doesn't answer any of the question.  HUGHLEY: It absolutely answers the question.KELLY: If you pulled the firearm in the officer, if he didn't disclose it, if the officer feel threatened --HUGHLEY: Why on Earth -- here's what we do know. He had a permit to carry a gun. When you get a permit to carry a gun, they tell you exactly how to act, when the police officer pulled you over.KELLY: What does that mean, he didn't threaten the officer.HUGHLEY: You're willing to give them the presumption of innocence.  KELLY: I'm not giving them presumption. Well, the law gives them the presumption of evidence. We don't know the facts. I mean, what we saw this happened with Michael Brown of Ferguson --HUGHLEY: We have a police officer's word and a grand jury's word.  KELLY: No, we have the Department of Justice's word.HUGHLEY: The Department of Justice shut down Ferguson. Ferguson had to be shut down because it was so corrupt.  KELLY: The Department of Justice found that the police there had endemic racism. They found that.HUGHLEY: Right.KELLY: But they also exonerated Officer Darren Wilson and they found out hands up, don't shoot was a lie, and that Michael Brown was the aggressor.HUGHLEY: Wow!  KELLY: Don't wow me. That's what they found.  HUGHLEY: I can say wow if I want to and I'll tell you this --KELLY: That's what they found, D.L.HUGHLEY: I'll tell you this, they found systemic racism, right?KELLY: Uh-huh.HUGHLEY: So, it's unbelievable, they also found systemic racism. And we know that Darren Wilson left the department because he was racist, he had to be disbanded. And with the folks at another department. They had rightful racism.KELLY: So, that makes him a racist.HUGHLEY: Absolutely. And you know what, I have no problem -- I have no problem.KELLY: Michael Brown grabbed that officer's gun and tried to shoot him in his patrol car.  HUGHLEY: That is -- no one has proven that. No one has proven that.KELLY: That's what Eric Holder's DOJ concluded.  HUGHLEY: And Eric Holder's DOJ concluded that that department was so ruptured.  KELLY: That's a dodge. I already gave -- I already conceded that, D.L.  We're talking about Michael Brown and the lie of hands up, don't shoot.HUGHLEY: I don't dodge at all. I'm here in FOX News --KELLY: Then let's stay on Michael Brown.  HUGHLEY: No, no, we're talking --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Eric Holder's DOJ --  HUGHLEY: No, no, no!KELLY: You're trying to get out of bounds. Let's stay inbounds. Eric Holder's DOJ found that Michael Brown --HUGHLEY: We were talking about the young man that just got murdered in Minnesota.  KELLY: And the rush to judgment and the assumption you know something when you don't actually know it.  HUGHLEY: First off, what I'll tell you is this, it is not uncommon for you-all to see one thing. The only place racism doesn't exist is Fox News and the Police Department.KELLY: Come on.  HUGHLEY: That's the only place. That's absolutely true.KELLY: That's insulting. You just insulted millions of people watching this channel.  HUGHLEY: And you know what, I'm insulted by the things I hear on this network so we're even. I could care less about people that insult me on a daily basis.  KELLY: You're making a point that -- before the insults -- the point you were started to make is true. And we can talk about that that whites perceived the situation when it comes --HUGHLEY: I think a lot of people on this network --KELLY: Let me finish. Let me just finish.HUGHLEY: I've never seen a black man that doesn't deserve it.KELLY: Could you hold the insults for a second so we could have a productive conversation? You were going to make the point that whites see certain incidents differently than blacks do. When we saw that in the O.J. Simpson case when the verdicts came down.  HUGHLEY: Sure.  KELLY: I'll give you that. Most reasonable people will give you that.  But you know what shuts down all reasonable dialogue is throwing out the term racism before it's been proven.  HUGHLEY: Do you know what -- first off, I'll say this, I -- I believe that there is benefit of the doubt given to police officers that's not given to anybody else, and obviously they do a tough job. In 2006, the FBI came out with a report that said that police departments were right with white supremacists. You said it not me. So why I would not believe if I know that, I don't know a black man that hasn't had a run-in with a police officer, from the highest to the lowest. So my perception --  KELLY: Uh-hm. You've been backed up on that by many people.  HUGHLEY: My perception of this is based on the experience I've had, just like yours are.KELLY: Uh-hm.HUGHLEY: So I am not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. I have seen a lot of things. I've lived in the city that Mark Fuhrman policed, that also had to be taken over by the federal government.  KELLY: It just -- it's very dangerous when you get to the point that you paint an entire group with the same brush based on the add actions of --  HUGHLEY: That's amazing thing to hear on this network. That really is.  That really is. Amazing thing on this network. The only place racism --KELLY: Thank you for being here.  HUGHLEY: Thank you for having me.  KELLY: Take care.  Also tonight, new details on a block buster New York Post report alleging that some FBI agents thinks Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton reached a secret deal. Governor Mike Huckabee is next on that.Plus, reports that the agents on this case had designed secrecy documents.  Special secrecy documents.Also, almost a dozen new polls out today point to one thing, the presidential race is tightening up. We're going to take a look at the possible game changer just ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I think your greatest accomplishment will be getting out of her e-mail scandal because that's the single greatest accomplishment to me that she's done. How she was able to get away from the lies, the deceit, the destruction of 33,000 e-mails. To me, that's the greatest accomplishment.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight and reported for the first time on FOX News, new details on the intense secrecy imposed on FBI agents working the Hillary Clinton email probe. Investigators were forced to sign on nondisclosure agreements, one Republican congressman going so far as to call them gag orders on FBI agents.Plus, new reporting from the New York Post tonight. An FBI source saying some in the agency believed that days before the FBI announcement when Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with former President Bill Clinton, they struck an inside deal to clear Mrs. Clinton sourcing FBI agents on that.Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge has the report live tonight in Washington. Catherine.  CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, an intelligence source close to the FBI investigation said, the decision not to recommend criminal charges was quote, ""demoralizing blow,"" adding the bar was set so high by the Justice Department, that there was no way FBI agents could cross that threshold and tonight, we're learning more about how these agents were sworn to secrecy. The FBI has confirmed to a senior Republican senator that agents were asked to sign this form called a ""case briefing acknowledgement,"" which says the disclosure of information is strictly prohibited without prior approval and those who signed are subject to lie detector test.The Republican chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley first wrote to the FBI director in February about the issue. And in a new letter review by FOX News, Grassley is highly critical of Director Comey's recommendation against criminal charges given the evidence he made public. ""In light of all of these inconsistencies, it is even more troubling that the FBI tried to gag its agents with a nondisclosure agreement on this matter in violation of whistleblower protection statutes,"" Grassley said, ""only after I wrote to you, did you advise your FBI agents that they are still free to speak with Congress regarding waste, fraud and abuse.""Last week in his nearly five hour testimony on the hill, Director Comey said he had anticipated some of the blow-black over his recommendation, and he recommitted to full disclosure.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: I understand people's questions and interest.  And I'm a huge fan of transparency, I think that makes our democracy great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: The FBI told the Senator, these disagreements are not unique but what we don't know tonight is when agents were asked to sign them and when they were told they could still speak out and go to Congress if there was a conflict -- Megyn.  KELLY: Catherine Herridge, thank you. Joining us now, former Republican presidential candidate, Governor Mike Huckabee. Former governor of Arkansas as well. Great to see you, Governor. So, what do you make of this? I know, you've got the same contacts in the FBI.  GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I worked with a lot of FBI agents during my tenure. One of whom was involved with the Whitewater investigation of the Clintons back in the '90s. And he was telling me that as he watched the Comey hearings, she was jumping out of his chair on several points. And then this whole idea of the nondisclosure agreement --KELLY: Right.HUCKABEE: The so-called case briefing acknowledgement. I mean, that is so euphemistic, it is a gag order. I mean, like what he's saying that Thelma and Louise actually just had a spontaneous steering malfunction. It's absurd.KELLY: But why is it strange? I mean, a lot of people are saying, well, it's a high profile case, why wouldn't they make them to sign a nondisclosure, they're going to be reviewing classified information.  HUCKABEE: Several things, Megyn. Number one, the FBI agents are already prohibited from talking out of school. It is in there at least three- volume manuals of dos and don'ts, mostly don'ts. Any FBI agent who has taken the oath to be an FBI agent is already covered by this.KELLY: Yes.HUCKABEE: He understands it. This was an in-your-face, according to FBI agents with whom I spoke. And the other thing that really is just amazing.  Number one, it is not the FBI's typical responsibility to decide whether charges are filed.KELLY: Uh-hm.HUCKABEE: They gather the information, they do the investigation, they make a referral to the U.S. attorney.KELLY: Uh-hm.HUCKABEE: And then the decision is made. When Comey came out and essentially said, nothing to find here, let's move along, it sent shockwaves throughout the borough. Because this is not the way things normally get handled.  KELLY: And then he says something else. He said that they'd knew, they never looked into whether she had lied to Congress in her under-oath statements to Congress about this matter, because those statements did not jibe with what he told us were the facts. And so Congressman Chaffetz said, well, did you look into whether she lied to Congress and whether, you know, those were falsehoods and he said, no, I didn't because no one referred it to us.  HUCKABEE: And the agent said that was one of the things that got him off his couch and screaming at the television. He said, the FBI can start an investigation because they read a newspaper article, or because an anonymous caller just calls up and says, hey, I think that Megyn Kelly has committed a felony.  KELLY: Oh, I do not have anything in demand to prove.  HUCKABEE: And everyone thinks she did. Yes. So, here's the point, for him to say before Congress, that oh, no, we have to have a referral, something has to come to us, that is on its face, absurd.  KELLY: Okay. But I have to get to the last question. So, the FBI agents are doubting. Okay. The last thing.HUCKABEE: Yes.KELLY: The suspicion that there was a deal cut between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, I mean, what do you -- a deal for what? What do you make of that?HUCKABEE: You know, when this all first happened, I thought it was Bill going out there, kind of ex-par just doing what Bill would do. You know, sort of taking it under his control. I made even the comment that I thought the biggest fireworks would be when Hillary lit Bill up that weekend. But looking at what the results turned out to be the following week when Comey decided, let's move on, you know, you have to think they talked more than just about Bill's grandkids. I just don't think that's right. Something must have been said. I don't think it was overt. But the fact that there were no witnesses and no staff. First of all, that never happens if you're an elected official.  KELLY: Uh-hm.HUCKABEE: It never ever happens, Megyn. I know I can't even get near you when you walk through the halls of FOX News. And you're a former governor.  It's like and I found out it was just all hair and makeup staff around you.  And I was like, you know, he looks great, I have to have access.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: I got to go, Gov.  HUCKABEE: I need more make-up and hair staff, yes, for sure.  KELLY: For the record, every time I ever saw Governor Huckabee in the halls of FOX News, he was such a fun, nice gentleman to talk to as you are every night.  HUCKABEE: Thank you.  KELLY: Great to see you.  And you know we don't like everyone but we really like him a lot. So, as the conventions draw near, big developments in the 2016 race for the White House, as a series of new polls indicate, we could be in for a real nail- biter here. David Wohl and Richard Fowler are next on that.Plus, Donald Trump is set to announce his running mate in less than 48 hours and we have new details tonight on who is likely to get the nod.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I just want to pick somebody that is very good. I want to pick somebody who is solid, who is smart. I'm not looking for an attack dog.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Breaking tonight with just fire five days to go until the Republican National Convention gets underway, Donald Trump is receiving some welcome news. In the form of a series of polls, that show an increasingly tight race with Hillary Clinton. A Marist poll shows Mrs. Clinton's lead has withered to just three percentage points now, 42 to 39 and that is the first time in a year that this poll has shown Mrs. Clinton below the 50 percent mark. What's more interesting is how some of these polling groups are describing this shift, and why.Joining us now with more, Attorney David Wohl, a Trump supporter, and radio talk show host Richard Fowler, a senior fellow on the New Leaders Council.  I haven't heard that one yet, Richard. That sounds important. We'll get to that.  RICHARD FOWLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NEW LEADERS COUNCIL: It's not that important. Good to be here.  KELLY: New Leader. Okay. So, it's good to see you. So it's -- you tell me, Richard, is pretty much bad news for her across the board today in this polling.  FOWLER: Well, I mean, obviously it shows that that race is definitely tightening, there's no question about that, right? But I think it's too early to look at national polls, not to mention the fact that both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are banking on unlikely voters turning out to vote for them, right. Donald Trump is banking on all those (ph) voters.KELLY: But wait, before you move to that point, on your point, they did look at specific polls. In Quinnipiac, Florida, Trump's now at 42 to Clinton's 39 and she had the lead on June 21st. In Ohio, they're tied 41 to 41. In Pennsylvania, Trump has 43, Clinton has 41 before she was in the lead so they did look at specific states.FOWLER: Yes, and I think that's great. Let's talk about Florida for just a second. So what we see in Florida polls over and over again is you see these crazy spikes. In 2010, on the race that I worked on the governor's race, that Charlie Crist versus Rick Scott race, what you saw was days before the election, Charlie Crist is up five, up six, up seven but end up losing by almost three or four points, which shows because the voters are so unlikely and you're not sure who's going to turnout, especially in Florida because of who they're polling.It's really hard to determine how it's going to finally pan itself out, which (inaudible) why even in the state polls, it's too early to look at these numbers. And the argument that David's going to make is well, it's all about the e-mail scandal.KELLY: Just let him make it. Hold on.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: You got your air time. David gets to say his stuff. Go ahead, David.DAVID WOHL, TRUMP SUPPORTER: Megyn, there's tectonic shift in those swing states, Megyn, when you talk about Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, I mean that is extraordinary what Trump has done at this point and it's a blowback, Megyn, a major blowback to the e-mail scandal. There's no question about it. Sixty-six percent of people find her untrustworthy, 56 percent of want her prosecuted and now her unfavorable, for the first time Megyn, are exceeding Mr. Trump's. She's in big trouble, there's no doubt about it, and as far as prosecution...  KELLY: No, they aren't.  ...look for that perjury prosecution, it's going to happen.KELLY: They're close but they're not exceeding. In the Marist poll, 64 percent see him unfavorably, 60 percent see her that way. I mean, he's got a 4 point edge on her on unfavorable, but its close.FOWLER: Quinnipiac it's reversed.KELLY: OK so, I mean, the voters, they don't love the candidates. No offense to you guys. They don't love these candidates. But Richard...FOWLER: That's fair.KELLY: David raises a good point, that the FBI primary, if you will, they may have exonerated her legally. It didn't exonerate her but chose not to charge, but man, the voters get it. They realized -- they heard what Comey said in the first half of his remarks that day that she misled over, and over, and over again, the American people.FOWLER: And they've gotten it all along Megyn. Those numbers are already baked in the poll, which is why Bernie sanders did so well throughout the primary.KELLY: Then why is she following?FOWLER: None of these -- none of these polls take into effect that Bernie Sanders endorsed her. The Quinnipiac poll in particular, the date that it went to was the 11th.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: So why she fought? If you're saying it's not her honesty, then why did is she going down Richard?WOHL: Bernie's people are either going to...FOWLER: She went down -- I'm saying this because -- where David is right, this is a tectonic shift. This is because the race is getting tighter. You're going to the convention and you see this all the time. It's standard polling (ph).WOHL: And guess what...KELLY: But David, they're getting tighter for a reason and that reason appears to be -- you tell me, the FBI primary and perhaps what we've seen in the country with respect to police and you know, this division and the candidates are dividing themselves on certain points, as well.WOHL: And Megyn, Bernie's people are either going to stay home or they're going to go with Mr. Trump.FOWLER: That's not true.WOHL: Either way, you've got huge damage to Hillary Clinton's chances. It's enormous, and I've got to say, Megyn, someone who's represented people like Hillary Clinton for 27 years in these type of criminal cases, the perjury case has already been investigated. It's ready to go. It can be turned way over to Ms. Lynch tomorrow. She could file this case tomorrow, no questions asked. If she doesn't,, that means the Fifth again.KELLY: OK, but I want to see this Richard. So, no question it's been a bad week for Hillary when it comes to the polling, really bad. And it's probably not the way she wants to go into, you know, the next couple of weeks with the conventions. A little hobbled. But you tell me whether she emerges from this, like this is her chance -- that's the lowest week since the FBI primary is now over and now she resurrects herself.FOWLER: Well, I think that's exactly what you're going to see the Clinton campaign begin to do. Hillary couldn't set herself a couple of weeks back. She knows she has to regain the trust of the people. She said that at the Rainbow PUSH Convention, ""I have to regain the trust of the people."" She's going to have to do that.She's committed to doing that. But with that being said, people vote for a candidate, not against a candidate. So, Donald Trump in this convention next week is really going to have to tease out what he's going to do for the American people instead of just saying crooked Hillary on repeat.KELLY: All right.FOWLER: That's not an answer.KELLY: We've got Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt coming up. We've got a bunch of thoughts on that. Great to see you both.FOWLER: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Breaking tonight, Donald Trump just announced he will reveal his vice presidential pick at 11:00 a.m. Friday morning. Got to turn on Fox News, Bill and Martha, maybe they're going to have a leak. Maybe they're going to have it for you. If not, Jenna and John are going to bust in the Fox News alert, they're going to bong in and they're going to tell you supposedly it's one of three men.So, now we know the day and we know the time. And Chris Stirewalt, and Dana Perino are ahead on why Trump's choice could be the most impactful decision yet on the road to the White House. Or not, it could have not impact whatsoever. So, we'll talk about that. And we may be just days from Cleveland, but tomorrow could be critical for those Republicans still -- still trying to stop Trump. We'll show you why when we come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN SPICER, RNC CHIEF STRATEGIST: This is something that I think has become a media fascination and exists only in the Twitter universe because it really lacks you know, one, a candidate, two, any organization, three, any strategy.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump just announced he will reveal his choice for his running mate on Friday morning at 11:00 a.m. Set your DVR right now. America's newsroom, happening now. If you don't already have them on DVR, you put them on right now so you don't miss the beginning, the lead up. What if he goes early? Trump himself says he is down to no more than four choices but really the three guys here he says.Governor Mike Pence, Newt Gingrich, Governor Chris Christie. All in serious contention for the number two spot on the ticket. Campaign (ph) Carl Cameron, our chief political correspondent is live in Indianapolis where Mr. Trump had a busy day, Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, he basically turned this into his campaign headquarters outside of Manhattan and had all kinds of candidates he was doing business with today for the vice presidential pick. The Trump family and the Pence family started the morning with breakfast, and of course they campaigned together last night. Trump ended up spending the night here because of some undescribed mechanical problems with the plane and the hotel he was staying at, the Conrad downtown became just a buzz of activity.Newt Gingrich came to Indianapolis and had a meeting. When he got back to Washington, Gingrich told associates that he learned during his meeting with Trump or shortly thereafter that he was one of two finalists with Pence. So, you've got Pence and Newt Gingrich both assuming that they are finalists for this. Chris Christie, who's been working for the transition team and was the first former rival to endorse Trump.The Trump and Christie families had been friends for a decade and he's got an inside track because of that, but he seems to have been sort of falling to the wayside in the last couple of days. And then the last one is Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Senator who was the first senator to endorse Trump and helped him write his immigration plan. And insiders say he's more inclined to be put in an advisory position because he really does sort of tend to have a calming effect on Trump during some of their discussions and have some different perspective.Lastly, at the Conrad Hotel, Megyn, there were a couple buses outside and there was another person there. Now, I'm not saying anything about this, but it was goth rocker Marilyn Monroe and an awful lot of kids were wondering who the bigger star was, and an awful lot of adults were wondering who the other celebrity there and he's certainly not on the shortlist, Megyn.KELLY: Marilyn Manson, right?CAMERON: Yeah.KELLY: Not that Marilyn Monroe.(CROSSTALK)CAMERON: Shows what I know about goth rock, right. Yeah, Marilyn Manson, sorry.KELLY: OK, Carl, great to see you. Can you imagine Trump and Marilyn Manson?(LAUGHTER)KELLY: OK, so our political panel is joining me now on Trump's choice. Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor and Dana Perino, co- host of ""The Five"" and former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, good to see you both. So, Marilyn Manson, Stirewalt -- I understand you took a position earlier today that there is no one who could overshadow Donald Trump. Marilyn Manson. You want to walk that back a little?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: No, I think -- look, I think that even -- my comparison was that even Evel Knievil jumping in motorcycle over the crowd during the announcement does not overshadow Trump. I do not think that Marilyn Manson -- because the goth, it's the black nails and he got the white make up. This is not right. You've got to be loud, baby. You've got to be loud.KELLY: I can't take the more orange (ph).(LAUGHTER)KELLY: But seriously, what do we think? I'll ask you, Dana. Seriously.DANA PERINO, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: First of all, you should promise to me.KELLY: Yeah, I know seriousness (ph).PERINO: I know Stirewalt will be down here in a minute.  (LAUGHTER)KELLY: Newt Gingrich saying it's down to me and Pence. That's breaking news.PERINO: I was surprised by that when Carl Cameron said that because -- I mean, obviously Newt Gingrich is his own guy. He's been in politics for a long time and I think it really takes a lot of chutzpah to come back and say, yeah, it's now between me and the other guy.KELLY: Because Trump has not revealed that.PERINO: He's being quiet.KELLY: Trump has not revealed that.PERINO: I mean unless Trump asked him to do that, which would add to the intrigue, but I kind of find that hard to believe.KELLY: Why would Trump go on Fox News with Bret Baier tonight at 6:00 and say, ""In my head I had it down to two"" but not reveal the two. And then Newt come out and say, ""It's me. It's me. It's me and Pence?PERINO: It's actually interesting. So, let's just say Donald Trump is tonight (ph), my gosh, they're equal in my mind. Does that bother him that he might -- Newt Gingrich might over step the bounds? Or did he ask for -- or does he not care?KELLY: All right, so...PERINO: As long as everybody is talking about it, it's good.KELLY: You know, what do you think is the wisdom of that? Let's just talk about Newt and Pence as between those two guys, Chris?STIREWALT: Well, it's hard to think that Mike Pence does anything for Donald Trump other than a former Republican brand that's badly damaged. He doesn't add anything in particular, and because of what happened, there was a Religious Liberty ill in Indiana. Pence muffed it both ways, made everybody unhappy, so I don't think he gets Trump what the Trump family thinks that he does, which is the support of Cruz voters and people like that.I don't think he gets that. I do think though that Gingrich, high risk. That is a -- talk about Evel Knievil on the bike over the crowd. It is high risk. You might not make it. Newt Gingrich could blow up a campaign.KELLY: Such as Newt, like Evel.PERINO: Yeah.STIREWALT: In the white jumpsuit -- white jumpsuit, it could be awesome. But he does bring you something, which is reinforces Trump's brand, as a silo breaker, as a disruptor, as somebody who is thinking way outside the box sometimes.KELLY: Fighter.PERINO: Way outside Washington.STIREWALT: So, it's something that reinforces the brand.KELLY: Go ahead. Oh, really, outside Washington? She's being sarcastic.PERINO: Yeah, now you can be serious and I'll take the other role.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: I also agree that Newt Gingrich would be good, but I'm going to go out on a limb. I think that Chris Christie is still solidly in contention.KELLY: You do?PERINO: I do, because remember...STIREWALT: Really?PERINO: I can't wait to see you Friday night and then you'll have to say, wow, Dana, you were right.KELLY: What does he gain him?PERINO: What do the others -- I think that he, well, Donald Trump said he wants an attack dog, somebody who would get into debates, somebody a little bit younger, Donald Trump -- I'm sorry -- Chris Christie fits all of those. He is a loyal guy. He knows the law. I mean, I just think that he would be willing to go after Hillary Clinton, and that Newt Gingrich -- between the two of them, I think it's a toss-up.KELLY: It's got a little, you know, how do you put it -- baggage, Chris.PERINO: Who doesn't though?STIREWALT: Yeah, wouldn't you want one...KELLY: Somebody, I have a guy who's somebody without any.STIREWALT: ...wouldn't you want one of the investigations into his administration to be cleared? Wouldn't you want at least one of the investigations in the administration cleared before you pick somebody for running mate? That's not good.KELLY: Bridgegate, is that what you're talking about?PERINO: I think he's already weathered (ph) that.STIREWALT: Well, there's Bridgegate and then with the...PERINO: And I don't think any Republican that would vote for on a Republican decision is going to worry about Bridgegate.KELLY: but wait, let me ask you this...STIREWALT: It's not that they worry about it, (inaudible) it explodes.KELLY: I'm over Christie, I'm over that. Any chance -- this is Trump -- so, any chance of a surprise, you know?PERINO: Yes.KELLY: Who's the dark horse that potentially, you know, might fly in? Who?PERINO: Oh, who. Marilyn Manson?KELLY: Come on, seriously. Who could it be? Do you have any guesses?(LAUGHTER)STIREWALT: I still think Giuliani is a good choice. I still think a Democrat is a good choice. I think for Trump creating all this drama, I'm going to give Christie the rose, or is it Sessions or who's going to come down here in the front and who's the real bachelor? I think it would be great from a drama point of view to change it all up at the end with a stunning season finale.KELLY: It sounds like Trump, doesn't it? It sounds like him.PERINO: And remember, somebody you haven't heard talk about recently is Mary Fallon, the governor of Oklahoma. I guess if I had to pick somebody out of thin air, I would say her.KELLY: Good, thank you for trying. OK, great to see you both.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: Oh, wait -- oh wait. Dana Perino is going on a bus trip with the rest of the pie. They're going on a bus trip to Cleveland, all of them on the bus together. And they're going to sleep in sleeping bags right nest to each other like little peas in a pod. Like little puppies, right?PERINO: It's a cruise. No.KELLY: OK.PERINO: But we're going to be on the bus and we're going to be on your show on Friday night. And there's the bus. I mean it's subtle, don't you think?(LAUGHTER) KELLY: I hope you pass a lot of fans in the show and not the opposite.PERINO: We do, too.KELLY: They'll bring on the eggs.PERINO: Looking forward to it, thank you.KELLY: All right, so you'll see more of that on Friday night, can't wait. Up next, as Trump get set to make a decision on his running mate, why are people still talking about a revolt on the convention floor? That's our question for James Rosen who's live in Cleveland, next. James?JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, good evening. That's right. First they call themselves, #nevertrump, then it became #dumptrump, now it' it's #freethedelegates. After the break, we'll examine if their chances of succeeding is stronger than my chances of driving ""The Five's"" campaign bus.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: Well, the next 24 hours could be critical for the GOP. The RNC rules committee is meeting tomorrow to discuss next week's convention as well as the movement to free Republican delegates to vote for whomever they want, not to be bound to what the voters told them.And with reports of renewed interest in this movement just days before the folks are supposed to rally behind a nominee, a little last-minute chaos may not be out of the cards. Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen is live in Cleveland with more. James?ROSEN: Megyn, good evening. One delegate here in Cleveland who was not opposed to Donald Trump told me that the party insiders who are whipping for Donald Trump are a bit worried that this Dump Trump Movement might at least make it to the convention floor. The RNC leadership says this is all a media confection -- that Donald Trump won the nomination fair and square and will be the party's nominee.At tomorrow's session of the rules committee, the Dump Trump forces will try to secure at least 28 votes, one quarter of the committee's members, to change the rules to allow delegates to unbind from the candidate they are pledged to support. If that happens, then the full convention would have to vote on that option. A leader of this movement, a delegate from Colorado, told Fox News she has the votes on the rules committee and she explained why she's doing this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KENDALL UNRUH, RNC DELEGATE: We know that Donald Trump -- the brand of Donald Trump is going to destroy our party. It's going to destroy our brand and he's not going to win the election. And he's not going to get elected. We're not going to have the Supreme Court justices, because we're losing the Congress, we're losing the House and the Senate, and the polling has shown that.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: With the Republicans having ironed out their platform yesterday, the party's chief strategist predicted to Fox News that not much will come of this Free the Delegates movement.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN SPICER, RNC CHIEF STRATEGIST: This is something that I think has become a media fascination and exists only in the Twitter universe, because it really lacks, you know, one, a candidate, two, any organization, three, any strategy.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: And that really is the key question here, even if the Dump Trump forces were to succeed, Megyn, who exactly is standing in the wings waiting to take Donald Trump's place? It's not clear who that would be.KELLY: Were they looking you up and down today or is it really, you know, you're a reasonable man, very well liked.ROSEN: Megyn, I can assure you I do get looked up and down during my travels here in Cleveland, but probably not by the delegates.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: Hey, I have to ask you. When you were talking to the folks about this, was there any movement away from this push given all the polling we saw come out today that showed a tightening race and Trump taking the lead in a couple of these key states?ROSEN: I think amongst the delegates and certainly at the RNC, there's been a fatigue with the whole process and especially with this effort to derail Donald Trump for several months now. I was hearing that back in April when I was covering the RNC spring meeting in Hollywood, Florida. They want to get on with the business of having their nominee and preparing for the general election and taking on Hillary Clinton.KELLY: So, when I come out to Cleveland -- I'll be there live all next week as most of Fox News will be -- I would like you to walk next to me wearing that exact outfit, I'm going to wear this outfit and people are going to be like, ""aren't they so adorable. They even dress..."" Look how adorable we are. We look like we belong on the top of a cake together, James.ROSEN: You know, Megyn, I knew if I were patient that this day would one day come, and I look forward to that stroll with you.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: Good-bye.ROSEN: And I can assure you that it will play out exactly as you just described.KELLY: See why we love him? Bye, James. So as I mentioned, yours truly, along with the show, ""The Kelly File"" will be live in Cleveland all next week for the Republican National Convention. We've only been waiting for like three years, right? Doesn't it feel like this race has, you know, going on that long? I'm going to be joined by some special guests for the history making week as Donald Trump will become the official Republican presidential candidate, unless that group gets its way. It starts on Monday.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So, for those of you who missed the top of the show and my interview with DL Hughley, we have posted it on facebook.com/thekellyfile. Love to get your thoughts on Twitter as well, @megynkelly. Thanks for watching. See you tomorrow at 9:00.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
