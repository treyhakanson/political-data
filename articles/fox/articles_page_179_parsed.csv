This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE HUCKABEE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: For the past ten months or eleven months people have been writing my political obituary. But what they fail to understand is that the American people are looking for a president, not a fund-raiser for the United Way.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, HOST: In other words, says Mike Huckabee, ""Look out Mitt Romney. You may have more money, but I'm coming after you in the polls,"" and the polls are supporting that.Some thoughts on all this now from Bill Sammon, Senior White House Correspondent of ""The Washington Examiner,"" Bill Kristol, Editor of ""The Weekly Standard,"" and Mort Kondracke, Executive Editor of ""Roll Call,"" Fox News contributors all.Let's look at the poll that got everybody talking. This is the latest from CBS News and ""The New York Times"", which is matched by several other polls as well, but here's this one.You can see Huckabee is at 21--that puts him ahead of everyone but Romney. The margin of error is plus or minus five, which means you could have a ten point swing, and it could be that the race is a tie, or it could be something else.Clearly, though, it's confirmed to some extent by other polls, so it appears something is happening. Bill, what do you think it is that's happening?BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": I think Huckabee is rising in Iowa.He is a good candidate. He is a good candidate. He did well in the debates. He spent a lot of time in Iowa. There are a lot of social conservatives in Iowa, and Huckabee is the authentic social conservative in the race, or so he says, and he says it with some credibility.HUME: What has happened to Fred Thompson, who appeared to be the guy that was going to receive that mantle?KRISTOL: He faltered a bit.I don't think it is over. We have plenty of history, if we compare what happened in--HUME: Is it possible that Huckabee is peaking too soon? The story is that he is a last minute player?MORT KONDRACKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ""ROLL CALL"": He has gotten this wonderful press. The media coverage of Mike Huckabee, based on interviews with him--and he is a charming fellow. I have talked to him, and he is a lovely guy.And he has a nice message. He is the one Republican candidate who shows any concern for middle class angst, for example. One-third of Americans from generation to generation fall below where their fathers and mothers were on the economic scale.One-third stay the same, and only one-third increase, according to this latest Pew study. He seems to care about that stuff, unlike the others, who are all trying to cut taxes for rich people all the time.But, now that he is risen in the polls, the scrutiny machine will go on. And it began with a big long article in ""Salon Magazine"" by the editor of Alternative Weekly in Arkansas which says that this guy has been up for the Ethics Commission of the state, sanctioned about five times, and has carted off stuff that was given to the governor's mansion as his own.HUME: (INAUDIBLE)
KONDRACKE: In any event, if he becomes a serious contender, people are going to go to Arkansas, test out the record, and see whether it all adds up.HUME: So you think it probably won't last?KONDRACKE: Look, if a third of the stuff that's in that article is true, I think he is finished.BILL SAMMON, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: You two just said contradictory things. You talked about how he could be the legitimate conservative, and you talked about how he doesn't want to cut taxes like all those conservatives.
KONDRACKE: I didn't say that.Well, I don't know what--actually, his plan is the fair tax, which would raise sales taxes. Now that doesn't seem to be a very popular idea.HUME: But it would eliminate the income tax completely.
KONDRACKE: Who would that benefit, though?HUME: You need a constitutional amendment to do that.
KONDRACKE: It helps rich people.SAMMON: The press has been talking about the Huckabee dark horse story for a year, but never believed it. I think in the in the last week or so, there is a sense that this guy could be for real, that he could legitimately scramble this race in Iowa.It is still going to be a long shot, but people used to think of him only as the vice presidential-likely guy. Now they're starting to think, well, he could do something.Rudy Giuliani's top advisors did a conference call yesterday and talked about how they basically are acknowledging that Romney will win Iowa, and they are now vying for second place, not with Thompson, not with McCain, but with Mike Huckabee. I thought that was very telling.HUME: It was interesting to see Rudy Giuliani and Huckabee saying nice things about each other, because--SAMMON: They want Romney to fail.HUME: Yes, they want Romney to fail.SAMMON: But one thing you write about, Mort, and that is when you're a top tier candidates, and these Republican top tier candidates have discovered, the press always accentuates the negative. Romney is a Mormon, Rudy is pro-choice, McCain is too old.And when you are a lower tier candidate, they say ""Look at Huckabee. He is so nice and likable, and he plays the guitar and lost weight,"" and all this. But now that he's succeeding, the scrutiny will ramp up, and they will say he raised taxes, he increased spending, and he is soft on immigration.Mark my words. They will go after him now.KRISTOL: People in the press think the press is powerful. Huckabee is not rising because of the press. Huckabee is rising because he has run a good campaign in Iowa. He will fall if the other candidates go after him, not because of media scrutiny.And that's a challenge for Romney, especially. Huckabee is a serious threat to Romney.HUME: Not that the media don't matter in a place like that?KRISTOL: The media matters, but there is not evidence that conservatives in Iowa are going to Huckabee because of one favorable story in ""The New York Times.""Huckabee has run a good campaign so far. But it is very wide open. At the end of the day, there are a fair number of social conservatives in Iowa. Either Huckabee or Thompson, who are the easiest sells, I think, to social conservatives, one of them will run in the top two in Iowa, I think.
KONDRACKE: This guy, Max Brandtley from the ""Arkansas Times"" says ""Come to Arkansas and look."" If he begins rising in the polls, people are going to go to Arkansas and look, and we'll see what the truth is.HUME: When we come back, New York Democratic governor Eliot Spitzer put the brakes on his controversial plan to give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. And impact the Hillary campaign, perhaps--stay tuned. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ELIOT SPITZER, (D) NEW YORK GOVERNOR: I have concluded that New York State cannot successfully address this problem on its own. I am announcing today that I am withdrawing my proposal.REP. JOSE SERRANO, (D) NEW YORK: Unfortunately--and this is my belief--he was not defeated by anything other than the hate in this country to its immigrants right now.REP. ADAM PUTNAM, (R) FLORIDA: Governor Spitzer has no one to blame but himself for the harebrain scheme of giving illegals access to driver's licenses.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: And so he came to Washington and stood among his state's congressional delegation, or parts thereof, anyway, and announced, did Eliot Spitzer, that he was abandoning the plan that had attracted a tremendous amount of controversy and had embroiled Hillary Clinton in, perhaps, the first minor or major, depending on how you look at it, gaffe of her campaign when she had trouble explaining her position on his idea of giving driver's licenses to illegals.The Obama campaign pounced tonight because she said she supported his decision. They are now saying he had six positions in two weeks on this.What about this controversy over illegal--first of all, what about the question about whether it was defeated, as Serrano says, by the hatred toward illegal immigrants? Adam Putnam--Republican, of course--says harebrained scheme. Who is right?
KONDRACKE: It's become a harebrained scheme because it's so unpopular. This is all in the context of the Republican Party deciding to make this a number one wedge issue in the 2008 campaign.And Adam Putnam is one of those Republicans who on practically every bill on the House floor has to add a codicil that no public benefits will be given to any illegal aliens, whether it's already illegal or not.KRISTOL: Who was the first person who criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting Eliot Spitzer on this? Christopher Dodd on the stage of the Democratic debate. Is he a right wing Republican hater of immigrants.
KONDRACKE: Whoa, whoa. I'm responding to the Adam Putnam, and what Brit said.This thing--many states have given driver's licenses to illegal aliens, including some Republicans, right? Now that it's been elevated to a hot button issue, it is a loser.HUME: Loser for whom?
KONDRACKE: For anybody who tries to do it now. It's become like a third rail.HUME: Because it's a good idea badly spoken of by Republicans?
KONDRACKE: Look, there are some states where it's worked, apparently. And it's a public safety issue.Now, politically, it will not fly, and, therefore, Spitzer should not have even tried it. And Hillary Clinton should have said she was against it because it's such a loser, and concentrate on what Spitzer was absolutely correct in saying--this is a federal problem, and it ought to be solved by the feds.KRISTOL: It was unpopular in 2003 when Grey Davis proposed it in California. It's one of the things that led to his recall. And Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is not a horrible right-wing Republican who hates immigrants, defeated him on this issue.People do not think we should treat illegal immigrants the same way we treat legal residents, legal citizens, legal visitors to this country. It's a reasonable position.You can be pretty liberal on immigration, as I am, and think their kids should go to public schools, and they should be treated in emergency rooms, and all kinds of things like that, without thinking they should get driver's licenses. It is not an act of hatred or bigotry to think this is a foolish idea.SAMMON: This hurts any candidate from either party who appears soft on illegal immigration. Those are the ones it hurts. It hurts people on the Republican side, too. Remember when immigration came up in the Senate earlier in the campaign? And it killed John McCain.And I think that the reemergence of this as a campaign issue will continue to hurt guys like McCain, guys like Rudy Giuliani, who is accused of running a sanctuary city, guys like Mike Huckabee, who supported the comprehensive immigration reform package that Bush proposed, which conservatives equate with amnesty.And it will help those who take a tougher line and say ""Secure the borders first, and then worry about comprehensive reform,"" like Romney.(CROSSTALK)KRISTOL: One reason this is so offensive, what Spitzer did, is we had a big national debate for immigration on whether we wanted to have amnesty and pass citizenship for the illegals who were here over the last year.Some of us were actually friendly to the liberal proposals that lost. There was a genuine, authentic national debate.Spitzer then ignores the Democratic process and says I just want to do this in New York and give them driver's licenses. Of course, they can use them anywhere in the country, not just in New York.So I disagree. Someone like McCain, who said ""I believe what I believe, but I have accepted the people's will. We need to close the borders first."" Someone like Giuliani or McCain who says that, I think, is in a different category from Spitzer who is just flouting what people think.
KONDRACKE: But election in and election out, it's demonstrated that people who are hot dogs on the immigration issue, who are going to send them all home--they take the Tancredo position. I'm talking about J.D. Hayworth--HUME: (INAUDIBLE)
KONDRACKE: But, nonetheless, it's a loser. And they don't win with that kind of campaign, which the Republicans have dedicated themselves to in this election.HUME: So the reform proposals don't work, and neither does the opposition to them, is that what you are saying?
KONDRACKE: I wish somebody would come up with the idea of impact aid to states in order to relieve them of the responsibility of the costs of handling illegal aliens.Content and Programming Copyright 2007 FOX News Network, LLC.

This copy(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ADI IGNATIUS, TIME DEPUTY MANAGING EDITOR: We picked President Putin as ""Person of the Year,"" and let me just quickly say it is not an honor. We're not saying he is a good person or a bad person. He is the person who has most affected the news in 2007 and going forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, ""SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRIT HUME"" HOST: They may not say he is a good person, but they did say this, and I quote ""Through an iron will, a clear vision of what Russia should become, and a sense that he embodied the spirit of mother Russia, Putin has put his country back on the map.""I wouldn't mind having somebody say that about me. But let's see what the all-stars think: Fred Barnes, Executive Editor of The Weekly Standard, Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of Nation Public Radio, and the syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, FOX News contributors all.We are given to understand, Fred, that in second place was Al Gore. J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books was third, Hu Jintao of China was fourth, and David Petraeus did manage to finish in fifth place. What does this say?FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": Just to make you feel better, I will say that you embody the spirit of mother America. So you said you would hope somebody would say something like that about you.Look, you can defend the naming Putin the ""Person of the Year,"" although I don't want to know what it means, what that Ignatius fellow said, the person who most affected the news. What does that mean? Is that the most newsworthy person, the most important person?If it just affected the news, I think Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, President Ahmadinejad of Iran affected the news a lot more than he did.And if you want somebody who's more important, I think that would be General Petraeus, who was pulled out of the jaws of defeat what looks like a victory in Iraq, and has changed both the Middle East, the war on Islamic jihadism, and the Bush presidency.That seems to me a bigger feat than stabilizing somewhat Russia, which you have to give Putin credit for. But the main thing that has happened that has helped Russia is the fact that oil and gas prices are so high.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think that's the reason --HUME: He has also de-democratized the place.LIASSON: He has de-democratized the place. His biggest feat is creating the situation where he can stay in power almost indefinitely and have another term when he really wasn't able to get one. But I don't think he affected the news more than anybody else. In another year you could say Usama Bin Laden affected the news.But I don't think that Russia is necessarily a major player. They do have oil and gas, and as long as that holds out, which it won't forever, as long as those prices stay high, he will be important. But I think you can make a pretty strong argument for putting other people on the cover.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Let's remember that Time made Hitler and Stalin man of the year back to back in 1938 and '39, which tells you that this honor is not an ideological endorsement, but it does tell you that Time has a history of a proclivity for strong men who make the trains run on time and who make omelets by breaking a lot of eggs.Putin isn't a mass murderer, but he is a guy who dismantled democracy. But the other thing here is that his influence has been spread over the eight years. The man who changed the world the most in this year is obviously Petraeus.In one year, he turned, as Fred said, a losing war into a winning war, a war of supreme importance to the United States, to the war on terror, to Iraq, and to the heartland of the Arab world. What is more important than that?His success is what changed the whole temperature in Washington, and without him, we would undoubtedly be in the middle now -- without him and the success he has had with the surge, his new strategy -- we would undoubtedly be in the middle of a humiliating withdrawal, a collapse of our authority in that region, and a victory that Al Qaeda had deeply coveted.I predict that in our lifetime, he will be president of the United States, assuming that we watch our diet and exercise.BARNES: Well, I certainly agree about Petraeus -- he stands alone.HUME: Could it be argued, though -- could an editor of Timesay, look, Petraeus did a good job of doing what he did, but the big thing was the change in sentiment among Iraqis themselves, noted first in Anbar province, where they turned against insurgency. Could you make that argument?BARNES: No, you couldn't credibly make that argument, because one of the reasons the whole Sunni awakening and turning against Al Qaeda -- obviously they decided they didn't like Al-Queda, they had experienced Al Qaeda -- but without the security offered buyer American forces, it would have died, and earlier awakenings like that had died in Iraq.So the American forces there were absolutely critical. It was Petraeus's strategy. It was his request for the certain number of additional troops. And it all happened in 2007. I don't know what more you want.If you want somebody who has done more over a period of years to revive their country, take the prime minister of India, Prime Minister Singh, who was the Finance Minister before that, and India has come from being a sluggish third world country to a country with a vibrant economy, and he's done a more amazing job with India than Putin has done with Russia.LIASSON: At least they put an actual person on the cover rather than a mirror, which is what they did last year when they named you, or us, each of us, as the ""Person of the Year.""HUME: Yes, I guess we got to be grateful of that. Charles, do you agree?KRAUTHAMMER: Yes. That was a lame choice.Putin is not an indefensible choice. He is very important. He may end up being the ""Man of the Decade"" for changing Russia's good fortunes. But in '07, clearly David Petraeus.HUME: When we come back with our panel, the White House versus The New York Times."" We will tell you what The Times wrote, why the White House didn't like it, and what happened. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today in The New York Times, it says conversations took place about the destructions of tapes, and it names Mr. Gonzales, Harriet Miers, David Aldington, and John Bellinger as being involved.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just this morning, in a regrettably familiar pattern, we learned that the involvement of senior administration officials seemed to be more significant than it appeared from their official denials.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: Well, in fact, they didn't make any initial denials. All that the White House ever said was that the president didn't find out about the tapes or destruction of them until much later, about the time all the rest of us found out about them.Dana Perino, the press secretary to the President, called out The New York Times about this and demanded a correction. The article that Senators Kennedy and Leahy seized upon is this one, and the subhead, as you can see there, ""White House role was wider than it said"" was the offending passage.Apparently the story didn't back up that part of the headline, and The Times has said that yes, it will make a correction of some kind. It claims to have done so already online although we looked for it and couldn't find it.So I guess you could say that The Times has done the right thing. But what gave rise to this? And I guess the Kennedy and Leahy comments show you that the impact of The New York Times can have on the scene in Washington.BARNES: They jumped right on it, no question about that. But I agree with it. I agree that Senator Leahy said this was a regrettably familiar pattern of The New York Times attacking the Bush administration unfairly in its news column.HUME: I don't think that's what he meant.BARNES: I don't think that is what he meant either, but it was a good quote. I thought I could seize on it, too.Anyway, it's not clear to me that there was a crime committed. I don't think they know that. They treat this as a scandal. Without doubt, I think in the normal course of events, the CIA would have and should have destroyed those tapes. If they had gotten into the wrong hands they could be very harmful to the United States. And let's wait and see, but --HUME: The only reporting that was done, and it wasn't based on anything that the White House put out, was to the effect that Harriet Miers who was then on the White House staff before she became the counsel, had counseled against the destruction of the tapes. This story does not say otherwise.BARNES: One other thing that's interesting, though, is how aggressively the Bush White House, feeling stronger now than it has in many, many months, I think, aggressively jumped all over The New York Times and went after them, I think rightly so.LIASSON: Well, it was pretty cut and dried. The New York Times said that the White House said something, but the White House hasn't said anything, as Dana Perino tried to explain. She is the voice of the White House, and she hasn't talked about it. As a matter of fact, she's refused to talk about it.HUME: Where did the press corps seem to come down on its behavior?LIASSON: The press corps is smelling a scandal and thinking there might be one.What is interesting about it, when you looked into the meat of the story, what they said is that there is now different accounts of what exactly went on in these meetings, not that some of these lawyers had argued for the destruction of the tapes, but that there were varying accounts, and they all weren't exactly the same in these discussions.HUME: Surprise, surprise.KRAUTHAMMER: What this story did is advanced the story in the sense that it added three names. We had known that Miers had had been involved in discussion, but it added someone who is now Chief of Staff to the Vice President, and poor Alberto Gonzales, who will be spending the rest of his life in front of committees and answering questions on all kinds of things.But what worries me is the alacrity with which Kennedy and Leahy jumped on this. It is clear that we are in another cycle of criminalizing policy differences.You can argue about whether the techniques that we had used are correct. I think yes. Others with deep conviction argue not. You can argue over whether it was ""torture"" or not, I'm indifferent to what word you use, others will argue it was.But we ought to be having arguments about what was done. What is going to happen instead is they are going to look for scapegoats to throw in jail and disbar the same way that Scooter Libby was made a scapegoat over the war in Iraq.This has happened for years in this town, and, really, it is a disgrace. Let's having arguments on principle and policy. But the pursuit of individuals to actually destroy them is a product of this, and it shouldn't be happening.BARNES: Indeed we have seen a lot of this. Scooter Libby is a good example. There are many other examples: the attempt to bring criminal charges against Karl Rove and others in this White House. You have two senators on the Judiciary Committee who immediately accept the subhead.HUME: It wasn't even in the story.BARNES: I know, but it was in the headline, and it is still The New York Times, and they accepted it as true and had a hearing on the basis of it.HUME: Well, they commented during a hearing.BARNES: Well, it was a big issue in that hearing -- the guy nominated for Deputy Attorney General.HUME: So where does this leave us, Mara?LIASSON: The Justice Department will do its own investigation of this. We do know that the CIA official who ordered the destruction of tapes had legal counsel before he did it, he just didn't just throw them in the garbage. And then we will find out what happened.Content and Programming Copyright 2007 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2007 Voxant, Inc.

One government watchdog group said the call hosted by the National Endowment for the Arts was disturbing and inappropriate, after an artist blogged that the White house and the NEA were steering artists toward creating works on contentious political issues such as health care.White House Deputy press secretary Bill Burton tells FOX News: ""We regret any comments on the call that may have been misunderstood or troubled other participants... We will take all steps necessary to ensure that there is no further cause for questions or concerns.""Some of those steps include high-level meetings, training sessions, as well as personal visits with staff to, ""make sure the message gets across.""Walk the LinePrince Charles is telling his citizens to hoof it.Speaking about the ""domination of the car over the pedestrian,"" the British royal says developers have a duty to put public transportation and the pedestrian at the heart of their housing projects.No word on whether the Prince plans on parking his two Jaguars, two Audis, a Range Rover or the vintage Aston Martin the queen gave him on his 21st birthday.-- FOX News Channel's Lanna Brit contributed to this report."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID, D-NEV.: No matter what you thin k of President Bush tax breaks for millionaires and above, we can all see that the middle class could use some help. But as everyone knows, my Republican colleagues are promising to hold hostage the economic security of the middle class.SENATE MINORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY.: We ough t not to be raising taxes in the middle of a recession. The Democrats like to call these tax cuts as if we're doing people a favor. This has been the tax rate for a decade.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, the Senate majority leader and Senate minority leader talking about the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts. The Obama administration according to top Democrats we're told, are considering refunding the extension to calling the -- president -- President Obama's tax cuts for the middle class.What about all of this, where it's heading and what it means politically? Let's bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.Steve?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I think the White House can rebrand as much as they want. The fact of the matter is what will happen -- the de facto effect of what will happen -- is a tax cut on the very people who in a recession the most likely to be creating jobs --BAIER: Tax increase.HAYES: A tax increase. I'm sorry, a tax increase.BAIER: If it's not extended to the top tier, you're saying it will be a tax increase on the people who are creating jobs.HAYES: On the people who are most -- in the best position, a, to spend money, and, b, to create jobs. It doesn't make sense.Republicans have been remarkably unified on this with the exception what John Boehner said over the weekend. But I think they sort of found their footing again and saying the same thing. At the same time 11 House Democrats at least who have said they want to extend all of these tax cuts. You've got three or four members of the Senate on the Democratic side who said that they want to extend this.Those numbers are small. They're still growing. I think Republicans are good to not complicate the issue. You could say that the president said last summer don't raise taxes in recession. He said it was the last thing you'd want to do. And he gave a specific reason for saying that, he said it would suck demand out of the economy. Republicans are wise, I think, at this point, to continue to make that argument: Why was it smart to avoid raising taxes last summer and why does it make sense to do so now?BAIER: A.B., the semantics of this are -- are interesting. Whether this has been, as the Senate minority leader said, the base tax rate for a decade after the Bush tax cuts were enacted, so people are used to this. If they go away it is an increase in the rate that we have been at for the past decade.The Obama administration wants to call this the Obama tax cut for the middle class, but yet, even if they get it through Congress, no one will be getting cut further from what they are today in the middle class.A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: Well, status quo is that they sunset in 2010, on December 31 of this year, that's actually status quo and anything new is a new tax cut. I mean, technically.It is a game of semantics. I disagree with Steve. I do think that they will all be extended. I do not think this will happen before November 2nd, and I think they will come back in the lame duck session and the pressure will be so enormous from the Republican victories if not a huge Republican majority, maybe a slight one or a close call with the Democrats barely holding on and I do believe that at that time they will buckle and extend it for at least a year or two to all the brackets.In the meantime, Democrats are back from an extended recess tonight in a very tense meeting, all coming together after having lost August in a disastrous way politically, to discuss the fact that they have six national polls bolstering the argument -- their argument -- that independents are with them on this issue.They're going -- the leadership will ask their members to go out and continue to campaign on President Obama's campaign let's drop the last two brackets, but I don't think it's voted on until November 2. It will be a fight this'll take rhetorically, but I can't imagine that they will take a vote before November 2 that can be called a tax hike.BAIER: In fact, Charles, we're hearing from some sources up on the Hill that they've already started working on cutting back the time on this session by one week, instead of leaving October 8th, they'd leave October 1st or possibly sooner than that. There's a question whether they'll get it done in at that time.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, it's obvious that tactically speaking the Democrats have no intention, I think as A.B. has said, particularly the ones on the edge have to vote for an increase in taxes in a recession.I mean, I think the tactical objective of the Republicans is to force a vote if there's going to be any vote, at least have one vote in each house which would extend all the cuts, because if you're a vulnerable Democrat in the swing district and you're in trouble now, it's going to be really hard to oppose that extension, a, because in general you don't want to raise taxes in a recession as Obama's own budget director said just a week ago, and secondly because you will be significantly increasing the taxes on one half of all small business income in the country.The engine of hiring in the country, you'd be raising its taxes by about five points when you are in the middle of a recession and unemployment is at almost 10 percent.I don't think there's a Democrat who wants to have to vote that way.BAIER: Steve, this is what David Plouffe, adviser to the president said on another network last night, quote, ""The Republicans who like to lecture us on fiscal discipline who created these deficits in the first place are more than comfortable giving $700 billion in tax cuts largely to millionaires and billionaires and they won't tell you who you to pay for it. Even worse, they say they shouldn't have to.""We've put this up before -- the joint committee on taxation estimates and how much all of this package really costs. If you want to say costs -- $3 trillion for the middle class portion, under $250,000, and $700 billion for top earners.HAYES: Look, I think that the stimulus is revealing on a broader philosophical level in that it tells you exactly whose money David Plouffe thinks this is. It's not the government's money. And that's the fundamental difference here. Republicans aren't making a good enough argument.This isn't the government's money. This is the people's money. Make the argument that they should keep their money, that they should be able to spend it the way they want to spend it, not the way that someone in Washington has determined, whether it's with accelerated depreciation or what have you. This is their money. I think it's a very effective argument the Republicans aren't making strong enough and often enough.BAIER: A.B., do people get it? You say Democrats are energized by this talking point. But is the electorate engaged in the issue?STODDARD: You know what, I really don't think it will be material in the face of enthusiasm gap and who is going to turn out in this midterm election: Older voters, whiter voters, angry voters, Republicans in the primaries in numbers we haven't seen in decades. I mean, I don't think this is going to stop.You know what we're going to see here, I'm just saying that the leadership is going to use this data to try to urge their members just to hang tough on this.As Charles said, and as Steve said, there's just too many Democrats splintering off. It can't go to a vote in the Senate. It's can't get out of the Senate and it won't go back to the House. We are not going to see a vote on this before November 2 because the Democrats are divided.(CROSSTALK)HAYES: Everybody should be asked about it anyway. That's the political relevance.STODDARD: And the leadership just wants them to stay unified on the message.KRAUTHAMMER: In the end it's a desperate attempt by the Democrats in a terrible economy where they have no arguments about how they have improved it of creating an issue class war. I think it's going to be a wash. Some people will respond on the class war issue, but others are going to stay it's insane to go around raising taxes in a recession.BAIER: Next up, how the health care law and the lawsuit against it is playing in the 2010 political campaigns. You can follow all of tonight's primary results, by the way, in the Show Notes section of our home page, foxnews.com/specialreport.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TROY KING (R) ALABAMA ATTORNEY GENERAL: I believe that the states will get their day in court. For many of us who watched Obamacare unfold in the United States Congress, we felt like our voices weren't heard. This court is the place we can come and we can have not just our voices heard, but the voices of the Founding Fathers, the men who set up this system of government that has been trampled as Obamacare has been passed.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Two hours in court today in Florida as three attorneys general argued that the Obama health care law is unconstitutional. In the response, the Department of Justice and the deputy assistant attorney general arguing before the judge there, saying that he thinks that this whole case should be thrown out: ""Ruling otherwise would throw out decades of case law and scores of decisions dealing with the interplay of state and federal government. It would be a revolutionary decision"" -- in part, the Department of Justice argues, that the mandate in place, that's being challenged now by some 20 states, deals with the ability of the federal government to tax. That's one of the argument that the Department of Justice is making.Here's what the president said in September of last year about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: For us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase. What it's saying is that we're not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: Your critics say it is a tax increase.OBAMA: My critics say everything is a tax increase. My critics say I'm taking over every sector of the economy. You know that. Look, we can have a legitimate debate about whether or not we will have an individual mandate or not.STEPHANOPOULOS: So you reject that?OBAMA: I absolutely reject that notion.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: The attorneys for the Department of Justice do not and they're making that argument in court. We're back with the panel.Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: So he rejected the idea last year and now he accepts it. Well, you've heard of situational ethics. This is situational reality. The fact is Obama early is correct. Of course, it's not a tax, it's a sanction. It's a fine.Look, here is why this is such an important argument. Really what's at stake in this case is: Are we a nation of enumerated powers, limited government, or not? Enumerated powers means it's not that the government has control of every area and gives you a small sphere of individual liberty. You have unlimited liberty and the government has small areas of control.Now, that's been eroded under the commerce clause. The government has extended its reach on the idea that anything and everything is related to interstate commerce.However, the health care idea, the health care, Obamacare, is a reach that is really extremely extreme in this area. It says that it can force a citizen in an arrangement with an insurance company, a private citizen, under the penalty of a sanction.If you allow that power, if the federal government can actually wield that kind of regulation over you, then there is no limit in any way on the power of the federal government and it's a kind of abolition of enumerated powers.That's why it's very important case and that's why whether it's a tax or not is what it hinges on.BAIER: And it will likely end up in the U.S. Supreme Court soon.On the issue of health care and how it's polling heading into the midterms, here is the latest poll from Rasmussen. Should the health care be repealed -- 53 percent favor the repeal of the health care law. What about this as a political issue, A.B.?STODDARD: It's very difficult. There was also one just a few weeks back from the Kaiser Family Foundation also showing that repeal continues to gain steam with the public and the law continues to fall out of favor. It is a very difficult issue. Democrats are running away from it on trail. If they voted for it, they seek to avoid any mention of it.BAIER: And there isn't one, really, is there, who is mentioning health care?STODDARD: There might be someone very safe in an urban district somewhere who is not in a tough election. Anyone in a competitive seat dare not mention health care reform.If they are a Democrat, conservative or moderate Democrat who voted against it they tout that right away in their campaign literature and television commercials. If they are one of the seven who switched the vote from no on November '09 to 10 -- to yes, excuse me, in March '10 they're in very deep trouble.And I think this lawsuit really shows you not only as repeal gains favor, there's also a small business provision and onerous paperwork requirement that right now a provision in the Senate failed today but is gaining bipartisan favor. This portion of the health care law, will be repealed in this Congress or next.And I think it just shows you, this is going to bleed into President Obama's reelection campaign. It's going, with lawsuits and partial repeals, it's going to be an issue again and again, into 2011 and then into 2012.BAIER: Steve?HAYES: Well, I called around several strategists today asking that very question -- is there anyone -- a Democrat in a competitive congressional seat -- campaigning on the fact they voted for this? And nobody could give me a name. The closest I came was Blanche Lincoln in Arkansas who is running an ad that basically said, she's saying now, ""I stopped -- a government-run health care program wasn't right for Arkansas and I worked stopped it.""BAIER: Getting rid of the public option.HAYES: Right. But in the primary she ran ads, when she challenged from the left, ran ads, she was touting the fact she'd stood firm and taken a tough vote in favor of health care reform.Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network, Inc.

Feinstein's Votes 	"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:Party LineCalifornia Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein is in hot water with members of her state party over her votes -- along with the majority of the Senate -- to confirm Bush administration nominees Michael Mukasey for attorney general and Leslie Southwick for the Federal Appeals Court.Media reports say a group calling itself The Courage Campaign, backed by left-wing organizations such as MoveOn.org and Democracy for America, tried to have Feinstein censured during the state party's executive board meetings last week.Feinstein supporters fought back -- literally -- with reports of shoving matches leading up to the sessions. Procedural rules kept the resolution from being considered, but supporters will try again at the next meeting.Security BlanketColumbia University is considering granting tenure to a professor who has compared Jews to Nazis, accused Israel of murder and has been criticized for having an adversarial relationship with his students.Hudson Institute fellow Richard Mintier writes in The New York Post that associate professor of modern Arab politics Joseph Massad has stated that Israel massacred Palestinians at Jenin in 2002 -- even though the United Nations found no evidence supporting that. He has suggested Israel poisoned Yasser Arafat, when in fact it facilitated his evacuation to a French hospital. And he was accused of threatening to expel a student from class after she denied that Israel committed atrocities.Logging OnAmong the many things people are thankful for this time of year might be the Internet. But executives in the porn industry do not feel that way. Conde Nast Portfolio reports the industry's lifeblood DVD sales were down 11 percent last year, largely because of Internet sites that let people download porn -- for free.The most popular of these is a knockoff of YouTube, called YouPorn. It features everything from amateur videos to professionally made films. YouPorn started up less than two years ago, its audience now grows at a rate of 37.5 percent a month and it is the No. 1 adult site in the world.But since it is a free site, YouPorn does not make much money -- only around $120,000-a-month in advertising.Big StoryAs many of you look forward to perhaps over-indulging at bit at the Thanksgiving dinner table, you may find it interesting that almost 2,000 people in Great Britain who are deemed too fat to work are being paid more than $9 million in what are called ""incapacity benefits"" by the British government.The London Times reports there are nearly 3 million people receiving benefits for 480 different conditions, including 15,600 people for ""malaise and fatigue""; 8,100 for ""dizziness and giddiness""; 60 people with ""nail disorders"" and 50 who cannot work because of acne.-- FOX News Channel's Martin Hill contributed to this report."

Rand Paul on Putin's power grab, debt ceiling debate, path to the White House	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" October 7, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, HOST, 'SPECIAL REPORT': We are pleased to have Kentucky Senator and Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul in our Center Seat tonight. Joining me on the panel, Nina Easton, columnist for ""Fortune"" magazine, Ron Fournier, senior political columnist of ""National Journal,"" and editor in chief of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham. Senator, thanks for being here.RAND PAUL, R, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Glad to be with you.BAIER: Republicans have had concerns about some of your foreign policy stances, some of the things you've talked about on foreign policy.PAUL: I've had some concerns with their foreign policy as well.BAIER: Exactly. And you've noted them many times. Now with Russia taking an active role in Syria a lot of people want to know what you would do as president. We asked people on Twitter and Facebook to write in. Yolanda Buford writes in ""How do you feel about Putin, Russia replacing the U.S. as leadership role in the Middle East? What would you do?""PAUL: I think the first thing we need to know is how we got here, and then the second thing we need to know is what is important to do so we don't get into a situation that we can't get out of.During the Cold War we had many altercations with Russia and the Soviet Union at a time when the tension was much greater and much more potentially dangerous. What I think is reckless and irresponsible of some of my colleagues who, on the presidential stages, to say we're not going to talk to Putin. Well, having no relations or communication with Putin is exactly the wrong thing to do.Others have now been saying we need to be prepared to use force against Russia. It's like, my goodness, we avoided that for 70 years in the Cold War. I don't think that's a good idea.And then others are saying we need to draw a red line. We need to have a no-fly zone. Well, that's also a recipe for disaster, for either an accidental or a purposeful shooting down by one country or the other.I think we have to work at how we got here. How did we get here? We used to have Saddam Hussein, a tyrant, who opposed Iran. He's gone now. Iran is stronger. Iran is now allied with Iraq. Who gave flyover permission for Russia to go into Syria? Iraq. Who said today that they're inviting Russia and want Russia to attack ISIS? Iraq. It's going to be a little hard for us to say Russia go home when Syria, Iraq, and Iran are all saying they want Russia to be there.BAIER: I get that looking back. But looking forward, what are you doing as President Paul? Are you OK if Russia is doing what it's doing, even though they're attacking rebels on the ground by all accounts?PAUL: I don't think I would put it that way, that I'm OK with it. What I would say is we need to stand up for our position, for our position in the world. But there's not a position, what are we going to do? Do you want to drive Russia out of Syria? Do you want to have a land war with Russia? There is no sort of scenario in which America can just stand up and say be gone, Russia. I think what we need to do is make sure that an accident doesn't happen, make sure that we have open lines of communication, make sure that Russia knows what our position is on this. So we communicate our displeasure and we try to say, this is not something we feel. But, you know, is there a military solution to this? There isn't a military solution.BAIER: Laura?LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE.COM: I think it's interesting to listen to Senator Paul because he's reflecting exactly what Donald Trump said with you last night in the interview when he talked about foreign policy, and before, and Gadhafi. He said better for Gadhafi to be in power, better for Hussein to be in power.PAUL: He's been listening to my speeches.INGRAHAM: Perhaps. But it's a fascinating divergence in the Republican Party. And I think it's fueling the support that you get on college campuses and fueling some of what Trump is finding out there as well.People want America to be strong, but they also like the idea of a humble foreign policy, a smart foreign policy, which is what George W. Bush campaigned on until 9/11 happened. But it's a complicated scenario, right, because we don't want Russia to become the number one power broker in the Middle East. Yet America doesn't have an appetite to go full force.PAUL: It's also why we have to look backwards as well as looking forward. You have to learn from the past. And when you look at the past, if there's one clear thing in the Middle East to learn it's that every time we've toppled a secular dictator, every time we've gotten rid one of the iron fists, we've gotten chaos, the rise of the radical Islam, and it turns out the unintended consequences were worse than maybe the situation was before.BAIER: Ron?RON FOURNIER, SENIOR POLITICAL COLUMNIST, ""NATIONAL JOURNAL"": I'm still not sure what you would do about Putin and Russia. But let's go to the Pentagon.PAUL: What do you know that is sure?FOURNIER: Pardon me?PAUL: Who do you know that is sure of what we would do? What I wouldn't do is no-fly zone. I think that's a huge mistake and endangers World War III. I would not close communications. So I would diplomatically engage. I would express our opinion. But the thing is I think war with Russia is really bad idea. And I can tell you that the people in my party who are saying don't talk to Putin, have a no-fly zone, be prepared to use force against Russia, that's all very scary to me, and the wrong approach.FOURNIER: There's the Pentagon has a $600 billion budget. Four or five months ago you suggested that was bloated, telling on Joe Scarborough, ""Do I think we need more than all of the next 14 countries combined? I think that needs to be examined."" You've had more than four months to examine it. Yes or no, do we need this much money?PAUL: I just had a vote today where I was the lone Republican that said I'm not voting for the defense spending and this extra war funding on top of that, because I think really the problem with our deficit, if you're truly a conservative, yes, you have to look at both the military and the domestic welfare. Instead we do the opposite. We have an unholy alliance between right and left up here. The right wants more military spending, the left wants more domestic. What happens? The unholy alliance comes together and gets more spending for everything. That's also why we're $18 trillion in debt, and it's also why I'm frankly the only conservative running on either side because I would be willing to cut both.FOURNIER: You would cut, you would bring us down below $600 billion?PAUL: What I would say is that you have to be able to cut across the board. That's what the sequester was. Some of the sequester was a cut in the rate of growth. But it was cutting across the board and it actually was something that was slowing down the accumulation of debt, and we abandoned most of that last year, and that what's coming up now and what many in the leadership are saying, yes, we're going to bust the budget caps. The last remaining vestige of control is going to be busted, but not because of Democrats. Because of an unholy alliance between the right and the left who are so avaricious for more spending that they can't get enough.BAIER: Nina?NINA EASTON, COLUMNIST, ""FORTUNE"" MAGAZINE: Senator, going back to your position on Syria and your overall sense of foreign policy, there's a compelling argument to be made that the reason Russia felt licensed to go into Syria is because we didn't stand up to Putin over the Ukraine, that we didn't arm Ukrainian rebels, which raises the question, what is the difference between noninterventionist and weak global leadership by the U.S. that eventually puts the U.S. at risk?PAUL: I think if you look at the region and you say why is Syria now involved in the region, you might say, well, if we look back, had we had not gotten involved in Iraq war to begin with maybe Russia wouldn't be so involved. So maybe it's an unintended consequence of the Iraq war.In the Ukraine there was no real military solution to removing Crimea, removing the Russians from Crimea. There was no real military solution that anyone even from the farthest right wing of our party was proposing to do as far as pushing them out of Ukraine. As far as arming Ukraine with self-defense, I actually favor that.BAIER: Back with domestic policy questions for Senator Paul after a quick break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: We are back with Senator Rand Paul in our Center Seat. Senator, you've repeatedly voted against raising the debt ceiling. One is coming up very soon. How will you vote?PAUL: I can't vote to raise the debt ceiling. It's sort of giving more credit to people who are drunk on spending, and we can't give them more credit. And so what I was use is as an opportunity to use the leverage for those who believe we have to raise the debt ceiling, use it as leverage to try to get spending cuts. In 2011 --BAIER: Even though President Obama says he's not going to negotiate on this front at all?PAUL: He said he wouldn't negotiate last time and he did. In 2011 over this he negotiated and we got sequestration or overall budget caps. So I think you do need that, you should use the leverage. All of these things should be points of leverage for Congress to exert their authority. I think --BAIER: You're up against the fiscal cliff of a possible government shutdown.PAUL: Yes. The other thing we discovered last time when we had this debate. The government brings in $60 billion, $70 billion a month. There's plenty of money to spend on interest so we would never default on interest. There's plenty of money actually to fund Social Security, Medicare, and soldiers' salaries. Little else is left in it, but it might be a good idea to reexamine what we are spending our money on.But I would use it as leverage to get reforms and I would force the issue. But I would also have done the same with the previous spending. I would have let all the spending expire and say now let's negotiate on what you want to spend money on, and it would take 60 votes in the Senate to get any spending bills through.BAIER: Laura?INGRAHAM: How much power does the donor class have over the GOP, specifically the GOP candidates for the presidency?PAUL: I think there are certain people that there is power exerted over them.INGRAHAM: Name them.(LAUGHTER)PAUL: Now you really want to get me in trouble. It's someone's opinion, but I would say that there are people very much influenced by, who the money they give to. I think there are people, and I would count myself in this category, who I'm uninfluenced by the money. I am what I am and I believe what I do. And there are people who give to me who agree with what I stand for. But nobody I think believes they can give me a donation that I will change my opinion. But there are people up here, many people, I would say the majority of Congress, will go with the wind, and the wind is money. Which way the money is blowing, they will go.INGRAHAM: If the Chamber of Commerce wants something to get done it usually would get done.PAUL: I would say the majority of Congress are influence-able.BAIER: Ron?FOURNIER: Donald Trump says eminent domain is wonderful. What would you call it?PAUL: I would call it one of the worst things the government does. And because one of the fundamental building blocks of capitalism is private property, and to say that the government can take private property from small property owner and give it to a big corporation like Trump or one of his casinos, I think is antithetical to freedom, it's antithetical to what we stand for. And the fact that he is for the abuse of eminent domain really ought to be disqualifier for any conservative Republican to vote for him. I keep waiting for everybody to wake up one day and say, oh, my goodness, he's not a conservative, because it's true. He's not a fake. He really isn't a conservative. And no conservative in our party is for using eminent domain like he is.BAIER: Nina?EASTON: Let's talk marijuana. You're considered, even though you don't support recreational marijuana, you're considered probably the most marijuana-friendly candidate supporting medical marijuana. But now we have in Colorado, which does support recreational marijuana, it's legal there and we have several hundred billion, or, excuse me, million dollar business, industry built around that. What do you make of that? Is that a good thing?PAUL: I think it's a good thing to allow states to make their own laws. And so it's funny, when we had the presidential debate recently many governors were standing up and beating their chest about how they loved the A0th amendment which leaves the powers non-enumerated to Congress are left to the states and people, until the governors decide they disagree with marijuana, and then they said they were for federal laws telling states what to do.But I'm sort of agnostic to the state of Colorado. I think the state of Colorado should get to decide. I am sympathetic, though, to people who have kids who have intractable seizures and have tried seven, 10 different medicines, and they want to try cannabis oil. People in the states would take that child away, send social services in, put the mother in jail. I'm against that. I am for more freedom. And I think particularly with the medicinal qualities of cannabis, people ought to get a chance to make that decision themselves.BAIER: Last one for the panel here before we move on to politics, Mattie Bear tweets in, ""Who would you nominate as the next speaker of the House?""PAUL: A couple of people have asked me that. I got one vote last time. I haven't decided whether to actually actively campaign. You know, anybody can be speaker, even someone in the Senate or someone not in politics could be the speaker of the House.But what I would say is that what I've been telling people, and I do believe this, it ought to be somebody elected to less than three terms. You want really new blood, you want to really change things? If you go to who is next in the pecking order in leadership, you're going to get more of the same. So nothing against any one person, but I would go to somebody who is brand new and fresh and just came in from the private sector.BAIER: Are you for term limits in this campaign?PAUL: Absolutely.BAIER: More with Senator Paul. We'll talk politics when we come back.     (COMMERCIAL BREAK)     BAIER: Welcome back to SPECIAL REPORT. Republican presidential candidate and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul in our Center Seat tonight. Senator, the latest Real Clear Politics average of polls has you at 2.3 percent. If you look at the state-by-state polls today, Florida, you're at two percent, Ohio at three percent, Pennsylvania at one percent. How do you turn that around, and what do you tell supporters who say we're just not seeing it?PAUL: You know, I'm thinking about going to joke school or something. Maybe I need better jokes. I've been told I need better hair, I need to be taller, I need better clothes. You know how many people tell me you have to do something different to bring your polls up?But I guess all I know is to say what I believe in. And I'll keep saying what I believe in, and that is that government is too big, debt is too big, and that we have to do something. And really the problem is not just the liberals, not just the Democrats. It's the right and left spending too much money. And I'm the only one saying that, that it's really an unholy alliance of both sides, some Republicans and some Democrats getting together to bust the budget.BAIER: But you're running for president but you're also running for senator at the same time.PAUL: I'm doing better in that race.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: There will be a decision at some point. When do you think that will come?PAUL: I'm going to let people vote. And I think the polls don't accurately represent our organizational strength in Iowa. We have chairmen in all 99 counties in Iowa. We have hundreds of precinct chairmen. We have 1,000 students rallying for us. I would hate to give up and say the students aren't going to get a chance to vote for someone who truly thinks you shouldn't be putting everybody in jail for marijuana, that really we shouldn't be at war everywhere around the world all the time, and that really there isn't another way, that there isn't a third way.BAIER: Laura?INGRAHAM: Trans-Pacific Partnership, I know you voted against the trade promotion authority. Donald Trump is against it. Hillary Clinton comes out today and is against it. What is your position on the super- secret document that nobody has seen?PAUL: Well, I can promise you once I take a final position I'm only going to take one. Hillary I guess has been on both sides of this issue. I don't like TPA which was giving special authority to the president. I think one of the biggest problems we have in our country is too much power going to the executive branch and going away from Congress. So absolutely I didn't want to give this special power and this special pathway for it to come through. I was also very annoyed with the fact that the trade agreement was classified, and at first they told me I couldn't even see it.INGRAHAM: Why was it classified?PAUL: I have no idea why a trade treaty would be classified. I'm still complaining. When I meet leadership in the hallways of Congress, I'm saying why in the heck do you classify --INGRAHAM: You know why they classified it. They don't want people to see what's in it.PAUL: I went to read it. And there was some staff members and we spent an hour, an hour and a half in there, and I'm not so sure I was even given the final copy because the final copy has come out recently. So I like to read things, so I'm going to read it first. I'm in general for trade, for trade, because I think trade enriches us all. But I don't like the organization of international bodies controlling our trade.BAIER: Quickly, Ron.FOURNIER: Three political operatives very, very close to your operation are about to face trial for alleged pay for endorsement scheme. Are they innocent?PAUL: I don't really know innocence or guilt or the law. The law is really complicated. And this is sort of campaign finance regulations. And a lot of it is how you report things, whether you report things. And in fact many things can be all legal and then someone tries to say they're illegal. And so I really don't know the details of the case. And they didn't work for me, by the way. None of these people worked for me.FOURNIER: Isn't this kind of Clintonian, this whole --PAUL: People going after them?FOURNIER: Are people going after them or are they possibly guilty?PAUL: Well, it took four years for people to charge them.
