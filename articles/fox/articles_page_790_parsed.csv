This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" September 23, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Protests in Charlotte were relatively peaceful on the third night of demonstrations, but tensions remain and calls are growing for officials to release tapes of the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. This afternoon we got our first look at the cell phone video captured by Scott's wife during Tuesday's incident. We're going to show you part of it now. We warn you, it is very disturbing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POLICE OFFICER: Hands up!RAKEYIA SCOTT, WIFE OF KEITH LAMONT SCOTT: Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him. He has no weapon. He has no weapon. Don't shoot him.POLICE OFFICER: Don't shoot. Drop the gun. Drop the (beep) gun!R. SCOTT: Don't shoot him.POLICE OFFICER: Drop the gun!R. SCOTT: Don't shoot him. He didn't do anything.POLICE OFFICER: Drop the gun. Drop the gun.R. SCOTT: He doesn't have a gun. He has a T.B.I. He's not going do anything for you. He just took his medicine.POLICE OFFICER: Drop the gun. Let me get a (beep) baton over here.R. SCOTT: Keith, don't let them break the windows. Come on out the car.POLICE OFFICER: Drop the gun.R. SCOTT: Keith, don't do it.POLICE OFFICER: Drop the gun.R. SCOTT: Keith, get out of the car. Keith, Keith, don't you do it, don't you do it. Keith, Keith, Keith, don't you do it.(gunshots)R. SCOTT: (beep) did you shoot him? Did you shoot him?(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: You could clearly hear officers telling Scott to drop a gun, but it's unclear from the footage whether he actually did have a weapon. His wife claims that he did not. Police maintain that he did. After viewing the video police took, the lawyer for the Scott family can't say for certain what happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JUSTIN BAMBERG, SCOTT FAMILY ATTORNEY: We're not, you know, throwing out accusations. We just want to know the facts. At the end of the day, if it is proven and the evidence supports that he did have a firearm, I can tell you that based on what I saw on those two videos yesterday, I believe it's still questionable as to whether or not he should have been shot and killed.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Kimberly, this is an unusual circumstance and technology is changing, possibly changing the way of the cases are going to be prosecuted in the future, because a call from the protesters last night and from the family are for the police to release the video. Typically they don't and I will let you explain why and why this is so unusual.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Right, so anything recovered at the scene and/or anything that memorializes a crime that's occurred or potential crime as part of the investigation will be marked and kept in evidence for the police and for the prosecutors to review. So it's highly unusual for a tape to be released. I think given what was going on and the riots and public safety issues, they want to make sure that at least there's some transparency to show the family, to provide them some understanding of the situation. Now here in this case, I mean, it's really unbelievable and graphic. And again, I'm sure it's disturbing for the viewers to see.PERINO: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: So if you get an idea from at least that angle of what was going down and what was transpiring, you know at the time. So what's interesting is the wife is actually a, an eyewitness. She's the percipient witness, but it's also memorialized within that videotape. Now, of course, it would also -- it's going to be introduced, per se, into evidence. They would have to, you know, authenticate, make sure nothing has been edited, et cetera, that it's in its original condition from the time when it was shot at first.PERINO: Juan, she's -- from what I can gather, we just hear her voice. We don't see her face. So she's -- she sounds remarkably calm and she's telling the police, ""don't shoot him,"" as if, perhaps, maybe she knew that there was going to be trouble. I think -- I was trying to understand that part of it.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, the police had guns drawn, and so that's evidence. With the thing that struck me in this very disturbing tape is that she says, he has -- I think what she called T.B.I., Traumatic Brain Injury. He has just taken his medication, so it's something like that about his medication.PERINO: Yup.WILLIAMS: She is pleading with the police. They are not responding to her even as she's speaking very clearly. And I think --GUILFOYLE: And calmly.WILLIAMS: You know, calmly.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: So to them. So to me, I -- you know it's like -- you know, somebody said to me, ""but of course, the police are zoned in on a potential threat, so you can't."" But you know what? My experience, I used to be a police reporter. There are other police around and included -- and not only the police who are focused on the guy in the car, and remember, they had gone there searching for someone else. So again, you know, we can focus on the details and I don't know how it will all come out, but I just don't want us to miss the storm by staring at a rain drop. And the storm is, I think at this moment, with video more and more people saying, you know what, there's a problem nationwide with police using excessive force, especially deadly force, against poor people and usually poor black or minority -- Latino people.PERINO: Eric, what do you think of the, the Scott family lawyer who is saying that he's --ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Can I just refute one thing that Juan just said -- I'm sorry, Dana.PERINO: Go.BOLLING: The numbers are actually directly proportional to the race of the person committing a violent crime. The number of people killed, whether you are white, black or Hispanic, is directly in proportion to the amount of crimes, violent crimes you commit.WILLIAMS: But Eric, that's not --BOLLING: So cops aren't targeting black people.WILLIAMS: But Eric --BOLLING: Cops are targeting people who commit violent crimes. That's that.WILLIAMS: Oh, let me ask you a question then. He committed a violent crime?BOLLING: It's one example.WILLIAMS: Oh.BOLLING: No, no.WILLIAMS: Oh, oh. What about the guy in Tulsa?BOLLING: But no --WILLIAMS: Did he commit a violent crime?BOLLING: But no. But Juan, but I guarantee you .WILLIAMS: Oh.BOLLING: If you, if you --WILLIAMS: So that's ridiculous, Eric.BOLLING: If you dig deep enough .WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.BOLLING: . you will find a white person .WILLIAMS: I see.BOLLING: . or Hispanic person.WILLIAMS: Yeah, Eric. I don't think white people in the country are complaining that police are --BOLLING: Who, is shot by a cop after a traffic stop.WILLIAMS: You say white police in the country are complaining that they are being targeted by police?BOLLING: Juan, you just said they're being -- the black people, the poor people are being targeted and the numbers bear out from the Department of Justice .WILLIAMS: I just said --BOLLING: . that it's exactly proportional to the amount of violent crimes that racial group commits.WILLIAMS: Eric .BOLLING: It has nothing to do with race. Period.WILLIAMS: . that's not relevant to this case. What's relevant is --BOLLING: I'm just refuting what you said.WILLIAMS: That's not -- no. Let me, let me, let me just say --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: What's relevant here is the number of black people who are fatally shot by police. And we know it's about 24 percent --BOLLING: Is exactly proportional -- right. And guess what, Juan.WILLIAMS: And the percentage of the population is 13.BOLLING: No. That's irrelevant.WILLIAMS: Oh.BOLLING: What's relevant is 22.4 percent of all violent crimes are committed by black people.WILLIAMS: Oh, so another word, if you see me --BOLLING: It's the same number.WILLIAMS: So if you see -- if Eric Bolling is a cop and he sees Juan with, he says .BOLLING: Juan, you got to take (inaudible).WILLIAMS: . oh, you are a criminal.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I'm gonna shoot and kill you?BOLLING: Are you ready for this?WILLIAMS: Come on --BOLLING: Are you ready this?WILLIAMS: You --BOLLING: White people are killed by cops at a 43 percent rate --WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.BOLLING: At a 48 percent rate. Of all the people killed by cops, 48 percent of it is --WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: . are white people.WILLIAMS: The majority of the population --BOLLING: They also commit 48 percent --WILLIAMS: You want to know what the population?BOLLING: Juan, 43 percent --WILLIAMS: It's like 70 percent of the population is white.BOLLING: We should move on, but your numbers are absolutely wrong --WILLIAMS: I will go up against you on this, any day of the week.BOLLING: Any time, any time. So look at the DOJ. DOJ put out statistics on violent crimes who commits and what percent and what rate --WILLIAMS: You are going to justify this?BOLLING: It's the same rate as people being killed by cops, Juan. Identical, identical, Hispanics, the same, about the same population as blacks.PERINO: All right.BOLLING: They're also killed at the same, at the rate -- at the same rate.PERINO: I think they --(CROSSTALK)GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: This is an example of the unbending mind. It's that -- it is so difficult to have a conversation about this because we go to our respective sides. There are statistics that tell a story. There is an emotional story being told, as well, right?BOLLING: Absolutely.GUTFELD: There's an emotional story being driven by tape.BOLLING: Absolutely.GUTFELD: When I look at that tape, I don't get any idea of what happened, because I can't see it.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: And I feel that what we're seeing aren't necessarily answers, but incredibly moving emotion .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: . and fear, and adrenaline. But I don't see what is actually happening. And the interesting -- you were going to talk about the deceased man's lawyer. And it seemed to me that he was admitting that there was a weapon but that might not be enough?PERINO: He said even if there were .GUTFELD: Were.PERINO: . he doesn't believe that he needed to be shot and killed.GUTFELD: Right. Yeah. But he did not deny that there was a weapon there. I think that's kind of interesting. If given the fact that I can't. Like I'm looking at a storm, a chaos, a chaotic storm, where there are things happening everywhere and I can't figure out what's going on there. All I know is that it's emotional.BOLLING: Can I point something out? That would be the reason. Now there's, there's, there's, you know, privacy rights issues going on because everyone is not going to be a traffic stop that ends up in a fatality. Body cams can be used for other -- for other things. And so there are issues, as Kimberly points out. But when a tape is released and there's already been commentary about it and another tape, a cop tape that's not released by both sides commenting on it, it may supersede that privacy right, in this case. And also, when it also spreads beyond the community of Charlotte, where other cities may end up in racial riots based on that tape not being released, it's time to release the tape.PERINO: OK.WILLIAMS: This is not about riots. This is about accountability and transparency. And, you know, we're not focused on the tape. There was a tape earlier in the week from Tulsa, where a man is standing in the street with his hands up. Nobody is arguing about that because the cop has been charged in that case. And we can go over it if you guys want to focus on each specific case. But I say --GUTFELD: We should, actually.WILLIAMS: If you do -- Greg, I think what you are going to do is you are going to get locked into the specifics as opposed to understanding what is a common issue now nationwide.GUTFELD: You said something very important. I want to be locked into specifics. Specifics are what tell the story. And an officer has been arrested and charged with manslaughter in Tulsa. There was another charged with murder for shooting a man in the back down south. Justice is needed out when you get to the specifics. But is you ignore the specifics for the general storyline, the general narrative, the narrative -- reality suffers. It suffers.WILLIAMS: No, but what you have --PERINO: I think we're missing the point.WILLIAMS: Oh, go ahead.PERINO: No, but I'm -- because I am going to agree with you, Juan, that the story is, we're talking about the statistics of death, but we're not talking about -- Kimberly, I will just go to you because we don't have -- you haven't had a chance to talk -- is the perception, and perception is reality if you are living it, that African-Americans and Latinos, especially in poor neighborhoods are more often going to be pulled over, maybe they are involved in more crime, maybe they are targeted more by police, maybe the police regard it as black and white .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: . are more aggressive with African-Americans than with they are with the rest of the population.GUILFOYLE: And that perception and that belief is the emotional trigger in this situation.PERINO: Right.GUILFOYLE: So whether or not the facts support that there was a weapon at the scene, and so far from the chief we are hearing, because now an independent investigative board, the state of investigations bureau has taken this over, which is customary in officer-involved shootings, they are now processing the forensic and the evidence recovered at the scene. And he said if you remember statements we made before, we still believe that is consistent with what they will find. I cannot speak to the investigation further, which is a telling point. You will not hear further from the chief .PERINO: Is that what --GUILFOYLE: . about the gun or --PERINO: Is that the kind of work you did in California, though? When you would go back and check after a .GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: . shooting that you would, you would be sent to the scene .GUILFOYLE: You get a page.PERINO: . you check?GUILFOYLE: You go directly to the scene whenever it was an involved -- officer-involved shooting or death at the hands of an officer or in needing (ph) custody, anything like that. You would go, you broke it off. You take all the evidence and you would question every single officer present at the scene and make a determination as to whether not to file charges, manslaughter, murder, et cetera. And that would happen. So it's an investigative -- independent investigative body doing it, so the police department isn't investigating the family.PERINO: Exactly.WILLIAMS: And one last thought on this is which is, he had a gun, but it's not legal to have a gun. He is in his car. He is in his private place.PERINO: There are --GUTFELD: Is he a convicted felon?WILLIAMS: I don't know.GUTFELD: I believe he is.WILLIAMS: Oh.PERINO: All right.WILLIAMS: That doesn't mean he can't have a gun.BOLLING: Yeah, but he also got out of --GUTFELD: Yes, it does.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: You mean he had a legal --GUTFELD: I believe -- I mean, for a permit to carry?BOLLING: But --WILLIAMS: I don't know.BOLLING: But Juan, you don't have to point a gun .GUTFELD: Company knows.BOLLING: . at a cop in order to -- for that cop to feel threatened and to - -WILLIAMS: No, but it's --BOLLING: To put the perp down.WILLIAMS: But it's more likely than if you are a black guy and you are legally have a gun, as we know from the Minnesota police .PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: Oh, boom. You are dead.BOLLING: What was, you know, when he was out of the car --WILLIAMS: Who was out of the car?PERINO: He was in it.BOLLING: Keith was out of the car and said, ""Keith .""WILLIAMS: I don't know if he gets out in the car.BOLLING: "". get out of the car. Don't let them break the window."" No, no, no. He was.WILLIAMS: yes, she was asking him not to break the window .GUILFOYLE: They don't have -- right.WILLIAMS: . and for him to get out of the car and just be safe.BOLLING: Right.PERINO: We have to run.BOLLING: But he got out of the car with a gun.WILLIAMS: I don't know.GUILFOYLE: And also, under North Carolina law doesn't have to be pointed at the officer .BOLLING: Right.GUILFOYLE: . to constitute eminent threat for them .BOLLING: That's what I'm saying.WILLIAMS: But remember, they were not looking for him.GUILFOYLE: . to be able to trigger, use of deadly force.WILLIAMS: They were not searching for him, Greg.PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: He was not a suspect.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: He is a private citizen .GUTFELD: I agree.WILLIAMS: . in his car.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: OK.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: We do feel for family and, we have a lot more to come. Breaking news in the presidential race, also just happened. Big news for Donald Trump, his former opponent Ted Cruz, now back to GOP nominee. So stick around for that unexpected twist. And later, if you have a question for us, you're in luck, it's Facebook Friday. You can post it now on our Facebook page, facebook.com/thefivefnc. We will be back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: This is a Fox News alert. After declining to endorse Donald Trump at the convention in July, Texas Senator Ted Cruz is now throwing his support behind the GOP nominee. He made the announcement and post on Facebook saying he will vote for Trump in November for two reasons. Listen up. Because he once pledged to support whoever was a republican nominee, and because his conscience tells him he must do whatever he can to stop Hillary Clinton. In a statement Trump says, he is ""greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz. We have fought the bottle and he was a tough and a brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again."" Campaign Carl is live outside Trump Tower in New York City, and he joins us for this big breaking news. All right. So Carl, lay it on us. What's the real deal behind the scenes?CARL CAMERON, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Behind the scenes, this was sort of agreed to in principal two weeks ago when Mike Pence and Ted Cruz met, just off Capitol Hill at the headquarters of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. At that meeting, we were told that there was just a lot of pleasantries, but we now know is that it was a discussion of Cruz saying that he would vote for Trump and he had a number of requests to have himself sort of be reassured that this endorsement of Trump would be worth it. And one of them was that Mike Lee, the senator from Utah, be added to Trump's list of potential picks to fill any Supreme Court vacancies. And today, Trump released a list, it's now complete, 21 jurist judges from around the country who he would pick from, and just from that list and Mike Lee was on it. And so Trump was releasing it today in part because he is off the campaign trail and prepping for the debate and there will be, want to make news. Very popular list with conservatives, it was helped developed by The Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups. So, that was where this started and now it's official, and Cruz notwithstanding his refusal to endorse at the convention is back in the fold.GUILFOYLE: All right. OK. Bolling, you have a question?BOLLING: Yeah. First of all, I think it's a great -- I just love the idea of a Ted Cruz on the bench. It would be fantastic. Constitutional scholar, conservative, I, I adore that idea. Glad he came around to endorsing Trump. The question is this. Carl, I heard that Hillary Clinton has put -- invited Mark Cuban, friend of mine, to sit front row for the debate, right in front of Donald Trump to kind of unnerve him. I just was wondering if Trump was going to do the same. I had a couple of quick ideas. I think, it maybe, either Anthony Wiener, you know, the husband of Huma Abedin, or Monica Lewinsky, any of those potential front-row sitters?CAMERON: You know what? It's not likely the Cubans going to get under Trump's skin. It is debate prep started right after the Republican National Convention. He doesn't have a sparring partner, per se, but they have gone through an awful lot of scenarios. And, really ever since the convention, every Sunday there was a group that would get together in New Jersey with Trump and talk about how to handle certain situations, giving him some one zinger lines, assuming that there's going to be criticism from Hillary Clinton. He is prepared for it. Overall, what the -- they have been sort of urging Trump to do is, when asked a policy question, answer it briefly, be aspirational, talk about your goals, pivot to what's wrong with the current state of affairs, pivot again to what's wrong with Hillary Clinton, end of time, pass it over to her, rinse and repeat. And if they are convinced that sometime in the first 45 minutes of the 90-minute debate on Monday, Hillary Clinton will get a little bit (inaudible), get a little bit boring. She's not the most sort of charismatic debater or campaigner in the first place, and they would very much like to see her illustrate that. And if not, Trump will also answer in kind. If she gets critical, he'll fire back.GUILFOYLE: Dana, question?PERINO: This -- you might not have an answer to this, but I'm curious if you have any word about possible -- the endorsement that Ted Cruz just provided to Donald Trump, if that also came with the possibility of some financial support from anybody who is backing Donald Trump's campaign as Ted Cruz looks to probably -- he's gonna pull a primary opponent in Texas or he thinks he might in Texas, especially if he had not made this move to support Donald Trump at this point.CAMERON: Trump is doing fine in Texas. And Cruz --PERINO: I'm talking about .CAMERON: It will do fine in Texas.PERINO: . Cruz in Texas.CAMERON: So if -- yeah. Now, I think that's not part of the mix here. The Trump campaign is delighted by it. They think that this is going to help. It can't, certainly it can't hurt. It's more unity. Trump is already at 90 percent of unified republicans, so this was inevitable. John Kasich still hangs out there as a non-endorser. Cruz didn't use the word endorse. He said he would vote for him, but both sides they say that, yes, this was an endorsement. So --GUILFOYLE: Juan, do you have a question?WILLIAMS: Sure. Carl, you know, on Sunday, Reince Priebus, the chair of the Republican National Committee said that anybody who signed the pledge to support the nominee and then failed to do so had no future in the Republican Party. So what I'm hearing today is, in fact, Ted Cruz thinks he still has a future. He might be looking beyond Donald Trump and looking at whether or not he can rally a base of republican support in a 2020 race. What do you think?CAMERON: Sure. Sure. This needed to get fixed. It's the kind of thing where you can expect Hillary Clinton to make note of John Kasich's absence on the endorsement list, an illustration of dissatisfaction for Trump within his own party that Clinton can take advantage of. So obviously, this is, this is something that Cruz and Trump wanted to get out of the way.GUILFOYLE: Greg.GUTFELD: Well, clearly, Ted Cruz's wife must be thrilled.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Is it true that Ted Cruz is not only endorsing Donald Trump, but he also admitted his dad killed JFK?(LAUGHTER)PERINO: It's part of the deal.GUTFELD: Yeah.CAMERON: But I was little -- those were the two criticisms that prompted him to say, back at the convention, that he was not in the habit of supporting people who slam his husband -- his father and his wife.GUTFELD: Yeah.CAMERON: So, yeah. That still hangs out there.GUTFELD: It does.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Hanging like a weather vane.GUILFOYLE: OK.GUTFELD: Ted Cruz.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Lying Ted.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Lying Ted.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: It's a good thing I didn't say that .GUILFOYLE: Look at, look at --WILLIAMS: No.GUILFOYLE: Look what happens when ""The Five --""WILLIAMS: No.GUILFOYLE: . eats (ph) themselves, like Carl disappears off the screen.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Bye.GUTFELD: (inaudible), I'm out of here.GUILFOYLE: He knows the real part.WILLIAMS: No, I got to go.BOLLING: Give us some call, Carl.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: All right, to be seen again on ""Special Report.""GUTFELD: He ran over to ""Morning Joe.""(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: All right. Let's just wrap. President Obama addressed the Charlotte riots in a new interview this morning. Now, can he help diffuse the tensions over policing in America? Juan has some unique thoughts.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: I've said this repeatedly, police have a really tough job. Typically, they're interacting with somebody who, for whatever reason, is not looking forward to interacting with the police. On the other hand, if you have repeated instances in which the perception is at least that this might not have been handled the same way were it not for the element of race, even if it's unconscious, I think it's important for all of us to say we want to get this right. This should be a source of concern for all Americans.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: What can the first black president do in response to the riots in Charlotte? This president is popular. He is an iconic figure among black and brown Americans. All of us want to be healed. The key here is to speak to all of us across the liberal conservative divide; black, white, Latino, Asian, we're all fearful of bad cops as well as the chaos and disruption caused by rioting. After riots in Baltimore, the White House produced proposals such as body cameras. They also provided funding for an improved community policing. The president started my brother's keeper to raise private money to help poor boys. Well, none of it stopped high rates of black men being shot by the police or the riots in Charlotte. Now he needs to say clearly, that all true patriots have to join him in speaking against unjust shootings of poor people, that's for sure. And to the young people in the streets, he also needs to deliver a clear message. He needs to say clearly and personally, that they are responsible for their future, not any bad cop. To that end, he needs to tell young people to stay in school, get a job before getting married and follow his example in building a strong family. And then I think he needs to pledge the years beyond his presidency to working to keep that ladder of upward mobility, available to all who strive for a better life. No million dollar speeches for this president. That personal investment would get everyone's attention; take us to a place of inspiration that comes with a self-sacrificing leader. So let me ask you, Greg.GUTFELD: Yes.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Do you say that he --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I he actually said to people, you know what, we, as Americans have a common vision here.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: And I have a common investment. I'm going to put my future into this cause. Do you think people would pay attention?GUTFELD: You know, I, I would say that it is probably too late. This de- escalation that occurs at the point of conflict, it's nice but it doesn't actually prevent the violence. It was a real opportunity for President Obama to transform a community over eight years. Instead, what he did was he veered toward white progressive identity politics and climate change like there were guns in his religion. You know, he clung to them. Soothing words are important. It's like putting a bag of ice on a gun shot. There was so much time, there was so much time that he had to do something, but he didn't reduce this ideology of victimhood that has been here for so long and now it's manipulated -- being manipulated for chaos. And I think he failed long-term.WILLIAMS: Well --BOLLING: Can I just agree with him? And the way he did that today, very eloquently did that by adding the perception of black communities being targeted by police officers. Because the numbers don't bear that out. They just don't.WILLIAMS: That's just...BOLLING: But I will tell you there is an opportunity -- we've talked about it quite a bit. I went back and did a little math. The percentage of black police law enforcement officers across the country is 12 percent. Mirroring the black population in the country. Perfectly mirroring.But in these cities where there's been uprising, where there's been strife, where people are protesting and rioting against the police -- Charlotte, Chicago, Baltimore and St. Louis, Ferguson -- I used St. Louis, it's the closest community, St. Louis, police came to Ferguson -- all of them had substantially lower percentage of populations of African-Americans on the police force than the general population the community.It's just -- very, very well could be a root cause. If there is some sort of bias -- numbers don't bear it out. But if there is, it certainly would go a long way if the police forces mirrored the general community in percentages.WILLIAMS: Dana, you know, the president was at that new African-American history museum in Washington. And one of the arguments he said is that people who visit might, especially whites, might have a better understanding of when we're talking about race and disadvantage in American society. Do you think that's possible that might open some ears?PERINO: I think it could, sure. I'm looking forward to going. And I think Bret Baier on ""Special Report,"" they're going to have a special feature, because they were able to visit the museum, as well. So that's coming up in the next hour.I do think that it's difficult for a president in the post-presidency to be more effective than he was when he was president. I think that he can add to the conversation, but I think that the leadership is going to have to happen by people who are the elected leaders or appointed by either the president or the governors and the mayors in those local areas.WILLIAMS: So Kimberly, what the president has said before is we should give police better training, greater accountability, better data. Transparency and community outreach. But I'm thinking that, if he was personally committed, it might be something that people, even his critics would relate to.GUILFOYLE: What do you mean by that?WILLIAMS: That if he said, you know what?GUILFOYLE: Personally committed.WILLIAMS: In the future. Because I think there's some presidents who actually have raised their stature post presidency.GUILFOYLE: You're saying get involved in this cause and do something meaningful...WILLIAMS: Yes. On this issue.GUILFOYLE: ... beyond the White House?WILLIAMS: On this issue, especially poor minority communities and specific...GUILFOYLE: Like My Brother's Keeper? And what -- you know, OK. Look, I mean, yes, I mean, it's like waiting to exhale. We've been waiting for this for eight years of his presidency. I won't begrudge if I see it after the presidency. I just would have liked to see it sooner in chapter one versus the -- what is it, the epilogue? Correct.WILLIAMS: All right. Well, still to come, ""Facebook Friday."" But first, ""The Fastest Seven."" Don't go anywhere.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back. Time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: Fastest 7(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: ... ""The Fastest Seven Minutes on Television."" Three political stories, seven peppy minutes, one Panglossian host.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.BOLLING: First up, optimistic. Trump must be doing well and scaring the bejeezus out of liberals. The Hollywood celebrities making a last-minute ditch effort to derail the Trump train.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TARAN KILLAM, CAST MEMBER, NBC'S ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"": You only get this many famous people together if the issue is...RANDALL PARK, ACTOR: ... one that truly matters to all of us.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A disease or...CLARK GREGG, ACTOR: Ecological crisis, or...DON CHEADLE, ACTOR: A racist, abusive coward who could permanently damage the fabric of our society.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do we really want to give nuclear weapons to a man whose signature move is firing...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Firing.KILLAM: ... firing things?(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Again, why do we care what rich, out of touch, limousine-liberal Hollywood celebrities have to say about politics, Greg?GUTFELD: Well, we do like it when they're conservatives.Oh, my God. A conservative -- because it's so rare.This is the cool kids. The cool kids have spoken, and everybody knows from high school, when they speak, it drives you to do the opposite thing. It's like you might be thinking, ""I'm not going to vote for Trump. I can't vote for Trump."" I listen to them, and I go, ""I'm going to vote for Trump. I'm going to vote for Trump.""And then I see Omarosa come on and say something completely idiotic, because she's insane. And then I go, ""Now I don't know what to do.""BOLLING: Dana, your thoughts?PERINO: Well, I think that celebrities are actually diminishing in relevance...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ... when it comes to -- I don't know if they were ever that relevant when it came to political endorsements anyway. They like to get involved a little bit. But you know, the ratings for the Emmys this year were way down. I think part of that is something like this might do well on, like, a Facebook page or something if you're a younger voter and you're looking at it. But other than that, I don't think a lot...BOLLING: Juan, sway any -- sway any votes?WILLIAMS: Remember, you have to target everything. So this is aimed at millennials. I mean, and that's a struggle for Clinton campaign. It's not that it's a struggle to win their votes versus Trump. It's a struggle to get them excited, energized and to turn out.BOLLING: K.G.GUILFOYLE: Perhaps. Perhaps it helps with, you know, some of the Bernie Sander types. But I don't know. Some of them are very independent, were bucking the system to begin with by choosing Hillary over Bernie Sanders. And they're still, you know...PERINO: They're like married (ph).BOLLING: Very oddly, the last couple of polls that show Trump doing better in some of the swing states were the Johnson and Stein were going down. It was going to Trump. And it wasn't supposed to be that way. Remember? They were supposed to be taking from Hillary.Anyway, all right. How about this one? K.G., you're up. Barack Obama killed it when he joined Zack Galifianakis on ""Between Two Ferns,"" the webcast. Someone on the Hillary campaign, however, thought it would be a great idea to do the same thing, thus proving once again that Hillary is not the politician that Barack Obama is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ZACK GALIFIANAKIS, ACTOR: Any regrets over losing the Scott Baio vote?HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Not a one.GALIFIANAKIS: So it wasn't heartbreaking.CLINTON: No.GALIFIANAKIS: But Chachi, who's going to be next? Max Headroom?I'd love to meet the person who makes your pantsuits.CLINTON: Really?GALIFIANAKIS: Yes, because for Halloween, I wanted to go as a librarian from outer space.CLINTON: I think that would be a good look on you.GALIFIANAKIS: This has been a lot of fun, Mrs. Clinton. We should stay in touch. What's the best way to reach you, e-mail?ROBOTIC VOICE: You've got mail.(END VIDEOTAPE)BOLLING: Some funny moments, mostly delivered by Galifianakis. Personally, I found Hillary Clinton a little angry and condescending. But that's just me.K.G., your thoughts?GUILFOYLE: Well, she didn't really say anything. So she was, like, that was supposed to be, like, the straight man on it and just not show anything.He's very funny. So I always enjoy him. You know?BOLLING: Did you like it?WILLIAMS: I thought it was hilarious. What are you talking about? I thought it was very funny. I thought she did a great job. You know why I thought she did a great job? When he asked her, ""Well, what happens if you get pregnant,"" and she said, ""Well, I'll get you a little booklet on that."" I thought that was pretty funny.BOLLING: I thought he was very funny. Did you...PERINO: That's what the point is, is that...BOLLING: For him to be funny or for her?WILLIAMS: The whole thing. Yes.PERINO: It's his show. If you can get one good line off or he remembers the thing about pregnancy.BOLLING: Yes, but remember Obama when he did that?PERINO: Do you want me to criticize her?BOLLING: He was fantastic. Well, no.PERINO: I'm sure Trump would do great. I mean, I don't know. I think that she was fine. And I think he's hilarious.GUILFOYLE: I like the ""You got mail.""GUTFELD: Let's be clear here. It was all scripted, including her responses.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I know.GUTFELD: It was all written there.What's great about being a liberal comedian interviewing a liberal for a liberal audience, it's not a lot of heavy lifting. There's tremendous leeway. You can beat a dead horse into dust, and people will still clap.This is one big inside joke that is deliberately awkward for that -- so it kind of loses its resonance repeated over time. It gets -- the joke gets older and older and older. I'm an expert at that.BOLLING: How about this one? Even after ""What is Aleppo?"", Gary Johnson stayed in the presidential race. Now this. It's a weird moment during the MSNBC interview this week that makes me wonder how in the world this guy can poll at 10 percent nationally.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think, if you were able to get on the debate stage, that you could pull even with Trump and Clinton in these polls?GARY JOHNSON (L), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I do. And it wouldn't be -- it wouldn't have anything to do with my debate performance either. It would just be that people would recognize that there's another choice and that there would be an examination of me and Bill Weld as -- as who we are and what we have done. Based on that.(BITING TONGUE) I'm not going to stand up there for the whole debate and not say anything. And (UNINTELLIGIBLE).(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: This is really...BOLLING: Agreed.BOLLING: I get what he was trying to do. But see, unlike Trump supporters, I'm not going to defend it. I think he was -- I think what he was doing was he was imitating Donald Trump imitating a disabled person like he did.PERINO: What?GUTFELD: Don't you remember that?PERINO: I do. But Donald Trump was accused of making fun of somebody else.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: Gary Johnson I guess is making fun of himself?GUTFELD: No, see that was -- I was kidding.PERINO: Oh!GUILFOYLE: Gary is just saying he'd get up there and say nothing and be tongue-tied. Listen, I don't know. Thank God he didn't do that on our show. It would have really freaked me out. I'd be, like, ""Whoa.""Juan had a different interpretation.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. I'll just tell you, I'll be honest with you.GUTFELD: What are you doing?WILLIAMS: She set me up, but I love it. Because what -- a man sticking his tongue out like that -- I have no idea what he was thinking. By the way, I saw -- I saw then a tape of this which was played -- you know, because they did this on MSNBC. And they had Casey Hunt there...GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: ... talking about it. And Michael Brzinski was like, you know, ""What was -- was this some kind of -- what is he doing?""GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: All right. We'll leave it right there.GUILFOYLE: That's a weird one, though. You know?BOLLING: Stay right there, because guess what? ""Facebook Friday"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC: THEME MUSIC FROM ""THE O'REILLY FACTOR"")BOLLING: You don't have rights for that.GUTFELD: I know. A little tribute to Bill O'Reilly there.""Facebook Friday,"" we answer your questions. This is a fun one. From Karen K. -- two ""K's"" -- ""If someone made a movie of your life, would it be a drama, a comedy, a romantic comedy, an action film or science fiction?""Going around this way, Dana.PERINO: Can I say independent art flick rom com?GUTFELD: OK.PERINO: I like those.GUTFELD: All right. That's interesting. Who would play you?PERINO: I have no idea.GUTFELD: OK, well, Eric.BOLLING: I think it would be, I guess, a political drama. ""Homeland.""GUTFELD: Yes. That would be fun.BOLLING: I'd love to be in that.GUTFELD: Yes. But it has to be about your life.BOLLING: About your life? ""Walking Dead."" Been a rough year.GUTFELD: It's been a rough -- we're still standing.PERINO: A great year. What are you talking about?GUTFELD: We're still standing, to quote Elton John. Or was that (UNINTELLIGIBLE)? I can't remember who that was.Was it Juan Williams?WILLIAMS: I don't -- I guess it would be, like, you know -- like one of those -- remember the -- you know, where people do something and you think, ""Boy, they can't do it,"" and then they succeed and you just feel good.GUTFELD: Yes. That's basically all movies. They all follow the hero that gets lost and that finds a home.WILLIAMS: ""Psycho""?GUTFELD: ""Psycho,"" yes. An interesting window into your life.WILLIAMS: There you go.GUTFELD: Do you walk around with a butcher knife?OK, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Romantic comedy filled with drama, a.k.a., ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""PERINO: Ha-ha.GUILFOYLE: Played by the other one who's good at what I do, Jolie.GUTFELD: I would be a Pixar film. You know, a Pixar film. And I'd be, like, a Keebler elf. And I would have a unicorn, and I would ride to outer space to fight space lizards.GUILFOYLE: Juan's looking at me for help.GUTFELD: But I'd end up on ""The Five""...GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: ... because I would choose.PERINO: This would be better?GUTFELD: Yes. But this whole ""Five"" would be Pixar.GUILFOYLE: You know, what's really happening right now?GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: There was a -- I think it was British. It was ""Wallace and Gromit."" Have you ever seen that?PERINO: I love ""Wallace and Gromit.""BOLLING: That was fantastic. You'd like...GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: It would be perfect.GUTFELD: I think we should make a Pixar ""Five"" tomorrow.PERINO: ""Cheese, Gromit.""BOLLING: He's Gromit.GUTFELD: All right. Suzanne E. writes, ""Is there one non-living thing you owned as a child that you wish you still had?""We'll go this way. Kimberly? Non -- has to be non-living thing.GUILFOYLE: A thing that I still had?GUTFELD: Yes, that you wish you still had that you had as a kid.GUILFOYLE: Oh, I know. So, it was an unfortunate incident, but I had my favorite, favorite, Winnie the Pooh doll...GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: ... that my mom gave me. And it was given away.GUTFELD: They always give it away. They always give it away, because it's dirty and smelly. But they do it when you're not home.Juan, that's injustice. They did that to me with my blanket.WILLIAMS: I feel for you.GUILFOYLE: No, I know. And it was after she died. It was very sad.WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, I'd love my baseball cards back, but my mother threw those...BOLLING: Threw them out?WILLIAMS: Gone. Gone.PERINO: Wow!BOLLING: Threw them out?PERINO: Were there any good ones?WILLIAMS: My baseball cards.GUTFELD: Oh, man.WILLIAMS: I had great ones. What are you talking about? I'm a real baseball fan. There's no question. And I didn't have that much money, but I had a lot of cards.GUTFELD: My mom threw out my ""Playboys."" When she found -- she found that box...GUILFOYLE: Juan's was so sweet, and yours...GUTFELD: When she found that box, it was over. And she didn't even say anything about it. I just came home, and there was an empty space in the closet.Anyway, sorry, Eric.BOLLING: I forgot where I was.GUILFOYLE: No wonder you're the one outside in my tree.GUTFELD: And it wasn't really ""Playboys.""BOLLING: My Schwinn bicycle. I would love to have that back.PERINO: ""Playgirl""?BOLLING: But also, do you remember...PERINO: It would be in a museum.BOLLING: Do you remember that football game? It was the first electronic football game?GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: Handheld game.GUTFELD: That was amazing.BOLLING: You'd keep turning and go around the defender.GUTFELD: I loved that thing. I could play that for hours.BOLLING: Forever, right?GUTFELD: God, that was beautiful.GUILFOYLE: Oh, God.GUTFELD: You can still buy them, by the way, on the eBay.BOLLING: Really?GUTFELD: Yes. I've seen people with them -- Dana.PERINO: So I wish I wouldn't have given this away. I'm sure maybe my mom did, I guess, along the way. I had an illustrated children's bible. It had all these pictures. I remember this picture in particular of Jonah inside the whale. And he -- remember, I told you this. And he had a little camp fire.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And he was, like, roasting marshmallows inside the whale as he waited to get rescued.GUTFELD: Right. And I tried to explain to you that that really didn't happen.PERINO: I know, but I wish I had that book.GUTFELD: That science refutes -- stories.GUILFOYLE: I remember you said that didn't happen.GUTFELD: I said it didn't happen. And I'm pretty -- I'll maintain that.PERINO: I do remember the pictures, though.GUILFOYLE: Greg's a dream buster.GUTFELD: The one nonliving thing I'd have to say is Uncle Steve. No more time? Next question was killer.GUILFOYLE: What was it?GUTFELD: All right. ""One More Thing"" next.GUILFOYLE: What was it?GUTFELD: It was occupations...(MUSIC: ""CINCINNATI WKRP THEME"")(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing"" -- Juan.WILLIAMS: Well, check this out.

But seriously, Mel Brooks, congratulations, you deserve it.PERINO: I agree. And that was funny.

I even got that one.Eric, save us.BOLLING: All right. I'll try. Let's just let that one marinate for a little while.OK, so there are two paths...WILLIAMS: Oh, dear.BOLLING: ... for Trump and for Clinton. Trump has to -- to win the election. Absolutely must win Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina. And then he needs either Pennsylvania or Michigan or a host of others.But this is the way Trump gets there.For Hillary Clinton it's very, very simple. She wins these states, it's over, folks. It won't matter anymore, no matter what Trump does. She wins Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Virginia, and she is your next president. Very, very simple paths.And what they did was this was a study in the big ""Weekly Standard."" Anyway, what they did is they take strong left and strong right, assuming that each will win their perspective strong state.PERINO: You know what I did? I printed that for my weekend reading folder. I haven't read it yet, but I heard it here first.GUTFELD: She has a weekend reading folder, everybody.PERINO: of course I do.GUILFOYLE: It has become digital, and it's now daily.BOLLING: I have it for you right here.GUILFOYLE: Exactly, we love it.

Now, fortunately, no one was hurt. The bear was caught, returned to the woods. It's a super happy ending.GUTFELD: Kimberly...GUILFOYLE: Never mind.GUTFELD: Kimberly, I thought it was a different kind of bare.PERINO: See you tomorrow night at 5 p.m. Eastern for a live Saturday edition of ""The Five.""

9	9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/04/12/how-paul-ryan-is-trying-to-hold-gop-together/	How Paul Ryan is trying to hold the GOP together	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" April 12, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I do not want nor will I accept the nomination for our party. So let me speak directly to the delegates on this. If no candidate has a majority in the first ballot, I believe that you should only choose from a person who has actually participated in the primary. Count me out. I chose not to do this, therefore I should not be considered, period, end of story. I am not going to be our party's nominee.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: House Speaker Paul Ryan today very adamant, much more adamant than he was that he was not going to be House speaker, that he is not going to be a nominee for the Republican Party, saying it should be from the people who decided to throw their hats into the ring. Well on the GOP side, that would not limit you much. There were 17 at the beginning of this race.Let's start there with our panel, syndicated columnist George Will, Amy Walter, national for The Cook Political Report, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.Amy, as we look at the GOP delegate count, today officially Missouri went into Donald Trump's category, so he'll add some more delegates to this, I think roughly 15. But he's leading by 198. The going bet is that he may fall short by the time you get to California of the 1,237. And if that's the case, a contested convention goes to ballots. Ryan, why did he feel compelled today to do what he did?AMY WALTER, COOK POLITICAL REPORT: Paul Ryan is getting a whole lot of pressure from people inside of Washington. What he is not hearing is pressure outside of Washington. And when he said, I will not -- I don't think anybody who has not been running should be on the ballot, he is affirming what we've seen in poll after poll, 60 percent plus of Republicans saying if you didn't run and you were not on the ballot, you shouldn't be able to get the nomination. So he is falling really in line with where the rest of America is, maybe not where folks inside Washington are.I think the challenge right now for everybody who is not Donald Trump is to make the case effectively that even though he will wind up short of delegates he will still have the most votes, he will still have the most delegates, and why the system is not rigged. It is not a joke. It is not the establishment trying on thwart him. It is the rules. That is a tougher argument to make than the momentum argument, which is the one Trump has.BAIER: The RNC continues, George, to try to make it. Reince Priebus on Twitter last night, ""The rules were set last year. Nothing mysterious. Nothing new. The rules have not changed. The rules are the same. Nothing different."" Setting up for what is going to be, it looks like a really interesting ride to Cleveland.GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, running for president is hard because it is not one campaign. It is 56 campaigns. It's 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, et cetera. And it is supposed to be hard. It's supposed to test presidential attributes, one of which is to plan ahead and look over the horizon, and another of which is to staff up with good people. The first thing a president does is staff the government with about 3,000 important policy making positions. So in that case, the rules are transparent. They're out there. They vary, and it is hard work.I'm going to say something about Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan didn't just take Paul Ryan out of the mix today. He took out dozens, scores of people, because they have not, by the Ryan principle, they have not entered the process.BAIER: By the way, he is the also the chair of the convention, so he has some say.WILL: And he may particularly have taken out the man who if he had not run in the first place, John Kasich, would be the white knight waiting in the wings. The reason I say he took him out, when Ryan says it is important to have entered the process, then how the process measures you becomes important. The Cleveland Spiders were a national league baseball team in 1899, and they held the record for futility. In 154 game season, they won 20 and lost 134. They had a better winning percentage than Kasich is going to have at the end of this. So by the Ryan principle, Kasich is moved aside.BAIER: Can you top the Cleveland Spiders?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Those 20 victories were spectacular.(LAUGHTER)KRAUTHAMMER: Look, I think Ryan was important here. Yes, he did do the Sherman-esch thing. I think he broadcast what had to be said, and I think he's utterly sincere. But the part of his speech that I found the most interesting was when he talked about what he was going to be doing in Congress. And that was kind of ignored, put together a policy agenda. He announced the personalizing of the presidential campaign.I think what he was doing in addition to pulling out of the race was to announce the first step of the rebuilding of the party after the rubble of this election cycle. There's likely to be rubble after Cleveland. And assuming there isn't, although I'm sure there will be, there will be even greater run after November.I'm sure that Ryan sees that it way. The party will be irredeemably split. And what he was saying is, and of course when you don't have the White House your leadership of the party comes out of the Congress. He says I will lead with a policy agenda to reconstruct the Reaganite ideas that have been leveled in this cycle. I don't think it is with an eye to the presidency. He is young. He can run any time in the next 20 years. It's an eye to holding the party together as in the post-Goldwater era.BAIER: Because if it is, no matter who the nominee is, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, whomever, they're going to have a tough time putting this party together.WALTER: Yes. I don't see how they unify after what's going in Cleveland. I was in Ohio recently and I had a Republican say to me, look, there's going to be a riot if he gets the nomination. There is going to be a riot if Trump doesn't get the nomination. This thing is now split. And bringing this party together is going to be be very, very tough to do.BAIER: On the other side, the other party, one of the candidates has been running for a year now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Everyday Americans need a champion and I want to be a champion. I'm running for president.I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified.ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Did you wipe the server?CLINTON: Like with a cloth or something?Nobody talks to me about it other than you guys.Let me answer one of your questions because I think that's what you are entitled to.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's the difference between a socialist and a Democrat?CLINTON: I can tell you what I am. I am a progressive Democrat.I am so thrilled that I'm coming to New Hampshire after winning Iowa.I don't know what we would have done tonight if we had actually won.I have said it wasn't the best choice to use a personal e-mail.It's a security review.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: OK, George, one year Hillary Clinton launched, one year ago today.WILL: We went directly from talk about how are the Republicans ever going to be unified to that. And that's how they're going to be unified. She is a great bringer-together of Republicans.It's an old saying -- overnight is a long time in American politics and a week is forever. And by the time the convention is done and dust has settled, and we've gotten used to the fact that there is a precedent, lots for precedents, actually, for conventions being deliberative bodies as opposed to just ratifying bodies, there she is going to be unifying the Republicans.BAIER: You do concede if Donald Trump gets 1,237, he is the nominee.WILL: Absolutely.BAIER: Yes, absolutely. Charles, Hillary Clinton, one year.KRAUTHAMMER: If he gets it, he should be the nominee.BAIER: Of course.KRAUTHAMMER: One year she is the luckiest woman on earth. She is a very weak candidate. I said so at the beginning. I was wrong about how weak Trump would be. I was right about her. But she is the luckiest because in a completely losable year where she really should lose -- if she can't beat Sanders she should lose -- she has run into a GOP committing suicide, and I think her chances are extremely strong as a result.BAIER: Quickly, Amy, Trump has helped her in the rhetorical game?WALTER: He has also help her unify her party. If Hillary Clinton has one big problem with her own party it's getting that Obama coalition motivated to turn out to vote. She might not be able to do that herself, but Donald Trump or Ted Cruz sure helps to do that.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
