This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good evening, I'm Bret Baier in for Bill O'Reilly. Reporting from Cleveland tonight.Thanks for watching this special edition of The Factor, ""Terror and Politics."" Bill O'Reilly will join us on the phone in just a moment to talk about the latest political developments and the Nice terror attack.But we begin with breaking news. A military coup attempts in Turkey. President Erdogan of Turkey is out of the country. Said to be on vacation. He claims his government is now pushing back while the military there has announced it has taken control. There are reports from multiple officials in the government claiming that the coup has failed at this hour. But the situation remains confused with conflicting reports over who is actually in charge.There is already bloodshed. Turkish media reporting at this hour, 17 police officers are dead after a helicopter attack on police Special Forces headquarters in the outskirts of Ankara. There are reports of police loyal to the government firing on crowds there are civilian casualties we're told at this hour. Thousands are taking to the streets confronting police. And military loyal to Erdogan. Wires are reporting explosions in Ankara.Turkey has a history of military coups. And experts say, this is a result of President Erdogan shifting away from a secular government and towards an Islamic model with crack downs on the population. Enormous international implications with these developments in Turkey which of course is a U.S. ally and a member of NATO. We're told Twitter, Facebook, YouTube have all been blocked at this hour.We are following this story very closely. We will bring you updates throughout the hour. We have a guest on this in just a bit. We will want to turn now to the brazen terror attack in Nice, France yesterday that killed 84 including two Americans. Wounding more than 200. That attack has vaulted terror to the top topics in the presidential campaign. Trump's supporter Newt Gingrich had the most provocative proposal to deal with the terror threat.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Western civilization is in a war. We should frankly test every person here who is a Muslim background and if they believe in Sharia, they should be deported. Sharia is incompatible with western civilization. Modern Muslims who have given up Sharia, we're glad to have them as citizens, perfectly happy to have them next door. But we need to be fairly relentless about defining who our enemies are.Anybody who goes on a website favoring ISIS or al Qaeda or other terrorist groups that should be a felony and they should go to jail. Any organization which hosts such a website should be engaged in a felony. It should be close down immediately.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: President Obama responded the Gingrich comments today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: In the wake of last night's attacks, we've heard more suggestions that all Muslims in America be targeted, tested for their beliefs, some deported or jailed. And the very suggestion is repugnant and an affront to everything that we stand for as Americans.We cannot give in to fear or turn on each other or sacrifice our way of life. We cannot let ourselves be divided by religion because that's exactly what the terrorists want.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Gingrich later clarified his comments today saying he wasn't referring to any U.S. citizens or to any Muslims who are loyal to the United States. All this on a day in which presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump made it official naming Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate.With us now for reaction to all of this on the phone is Bill O'Reilly. Hi, Bill.BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST, ""THE O'REILLY FACTOR"": Thanks for sitting in for me, Bret.BAIER: You got it. What about this, Gingrich and the response from President Obama?O'REILLY: I think the speaker overdid it a little bit because, you know, I always go back to the fact that you can't single out any religion under our constitution for scrutiny. So, I -- you know, the sentiment is correct, I mean, Sharia Law is not compatible with the United States and the constitutional freedoms that we have. All right. We all know that. But, you know, we have tolerated in this country communism fascism. We have tolerated all of that. And I don't think you can basically say, well, we are going to give every Muslim a test to see if the Muslim passes the test.And then it gets political. I think President Obama distorted the remarks and tried to, you know, he obviously knows that Gringrich is part of the Trump campaign and part of the Democratic strategy is to demonize Trump as this guy who is going to come after minorities Muslims, Mexicans, gays whoever it may be. I didn't like either the Speaker's remarks or the President's remarks.BAIER: All right. So today Donald Trump makes it official. We talked about it last night on your show, about Mike Pence, Indiana governor.O'REILLY: Right.BAIER: There was some back and forth about it. But your thoughts and how this plays out. Not the process of how we got there but how this plays out for Donald Trump as he unveils this pick here at the GOP convention next week?O'REILLY: Well, I think it's obvious that the Trump campaign wants to tamp it down a little bit. So they pick a guy who is deliberate in his actions, who is not hot like Newt Gingrich would have been. They are going to say, you know what? We haven't won on the Republican side. So, let's now try to convince people in the middle who aren't, you know, decided yet, and there is not many of them by the way. And we can do that a little bit if we tamp down the rhetoric and we tamp down the presentation.So, they picked Governor Pence, evangelical guy. Social conservative. Conservatives in America should like him. That choice. Very smart guy. Capable of running the country in my opinion, but he is not an exciting guy. So, I guess they are just going to let Trump do all the excitement. It makes sense.BAIER: So do you think that Pence is going to shore up the conservatives who --O'REILLY: Yes.BAIER: -- may have, you know, some concerns about Donald Trump and how he has been campaigning, what he has been talking about?O'REILLY: Yes. I think that the combination of Pence as VP and the conservatives disdain for Secretary Clinton will get many conservatives out to vote for Trump even if they don't like him.BAIER: All right. We were just covering at the top of the show the breaking news out of Turkey. And we are still trying to get a sense Bill - -O'REILLY: Yes.BAIER: -- of exactly what is happening and whether this coup has failed, whether it's still going on. We keep on getting these items coming over the wires of these attacks. In Ankara, the plane flights in Istanbul shut down. The President has sided with the Erdogan government. You would expect him I guess to do that.O'REILLY: Yes.BAIER: But if this coup fails, it seems like it would empower Erdogan to continue cracking down in Turkey, keep moving closer to this Islamic government.O'REILLY: The picture for the American citizen who doesn't particularly care what happens inside Turkey is that the whole region in the Middle East is now in an uproar. The whole region. And this is what happens when the United States steps back and tries to become one nation of many and doesn't lead. Now, it would be interesting to find out if the CIA had a heads up on this coup, which they should have had, all right?So if U.S. intelligence knew that this was coming down, I don't know if we will be able to find that out or not. I hope we will be able, to but the importance to Americans is that the Middle East is absolute chaos, anything could happen. And, you know, we are in a war against radical Islam and this kind of stuff just makes it more difficult to fight that war.BAIER: Last thing before I let you go. You have a special this weekend, this Sunday ""Legends & Lies.""O'REILLY: Yes. ""Legends & Lies"" really taking off now, become a major ratings for us and we have Benedict Arnold, the greatest traitor in American history, the most infamous, probably is a better word. And his relationship with George Washington which is not widely known. So, I think everybody interested in history and then the country will enjoy it.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2013/07/31/herman-cain-obama-playing-distraction-politics/	Herman Cain: Obama playing 'distraction politics'	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" July 30, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: And on the day the president is pushing a grand bargain to get more jobs, a look at why he seems very selective about what constitutes progress on jobs.A few hundred for solar projects that ended up costing us billions worth the price. Only 2,000 jobs tops for the Keystone pipeline hardly worth the fuss. Never mind Republicans think he is way off. Since when are 2,000 jobs anywhere worth sloughing off, or Democratic D.C. City Council happily hiking the minimum wage and scaring thousands of Wal-Mart jobs off. Or the president himself today speaking at an Amazon facility where they're adding jobs, but because unions don't think they pay enough, they're all but waving off those jobs.To Herman Cain, who is just ticked off.Herman, what do you make of all this?HERMAN CAIN, CEO, THE NEW VOICE: Well, ticked off is family-friendly language for how I really feel.(LAUGHTER)CAIN: And I feel that the president is playing two games out here, Neil, distraction politics and class warfare.Look, the 2,000 jobs that the Keystone pipeline would probably create directly doesn't include the jobs that would be created indirectly as a result of those 2,000 jobs. Secondly, it would increase our accessibility to oil and gasoline in this country, because we are already looking at the price of gasoline being nearly twice the national average.Distraction politics also because in his speeches, as you know, he talks about phony scandals. Well, I got news for the president. The American people, those that not gullible, they are not buying it. There was nothing phony about the people that died in Benghazi. There's nothing phony about the abuse of the IRS. So that's number one.And, number two, if I may, class warfare. The demonstrations in New York by fast-food workers is nothing but the SEIU stirring the pot. Do you think Betty on the whopper board called six cities around the country and said let's have a demonstration and boycott?No. They are stirring the pot to try and basically push the notion that they are not being treated fairly. Let the marketplace decide.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Well, let the marketplace decide. The SEIU, you're referring to the service workers union.But I do want to go back to the president and how he has shifted his position on jobs, particularly with regard to Keystone, because when he talked to The New York Times, he was relegating it to 2,000 jobs tops. Today, he went even further. I want to get your reaction to this, because it flies in the face of even recent comments. This is the president today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: They keep on talking about this -- an oil pipeline coming down from Canada that is estimated to create about 50 permanent jobs. That's not a jobs plan.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO: All right. A few days ago, he's telling The New York Times 2,000 jobs. His own State Department a couple of years ago said it was going to create 40,000 jobs. The companies involved peg it anywhere between 20,000 and 60,000 jobs. What is behind the moving math? What's going on here?CAIN: You know, Neil, in 1994, I had to point out to Bill Clinton, Mr. President, your numbers are wrong. So now I have to point out to President Obama, Mr. President, your numbers are simply wrong.But he is right about one thing. Keystone is not a jobs plan. It's a jobs start. Nobody ever claimed that the Keystone pipeline was going to be all we needed to get a robust economy going.So once again, he wants people focusing on his careless use of numbers, trying to figure out what is right, what is wrong. That's part of distraction politics, in my opinion.CAVUTO: All right. Well, in this environment, any job is better than no job, but good points all.CAIN: Yes.CAVUTO: Herman Cain, great seeing you again.CAIN: Happy to be with you, Neil.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

3	3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/03/15/ohio-impact-on-gop-race/	Ohio's impact on the GOP race	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" March 14, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us. I'm Bill O'Reilly in the Hume Zone segment tonight, there are a bunch of new polls out. We are not going it give them to you because the polling has been very shaky lately. Tomorrow there are votes in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and North Carolina. Donald Trump wins Florida and Ohio, he has got it, it's over. But what happens if he loses Ohio to John Kasich?With us now here in New York City warming up for tomorrow's election coverage Brit Hume. Yes, so that's what everybody -- it looks Florida is going to go to Trump. You agree with that right?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: That's -- there is not a single poll that shows.O'REILLY: There is not anything -- although you got to give it to Rubio. He has running going door to door -- I think he's visited every home.HUME: You know, we had that result in Michigan last week on the Democratic side.O'REILLY: And that's what he is hoping for.HUME: You're thinking somebody who is 20 points down could win.O'REILLY: Right. But I know Florida pretty well. I just can't see Trump losing there. But in Ohio, the FOX News poll has Kasich ahead. And another couple polls do as well. So, let's assume that Trump doesn't win Ohio. And then Illinois doesn't do that well either. Which is possible. Then what happens?HUME: Well, you have got to think about the other states and how well he might do in those.O'REILLY: North Carolina he will do well.HUME: Yes, I think so. But North Carolina is professional.O'REILLY: Right.HUME: So the delegates will be scattered all over the place. And he may win the most but it won't be that big of deal. The big ones is Florida. Of course, that's 99 delegates. Ohio only has 66. So, if he wins one -- if he wins one -- Florida, not the other, he is still 33 delegates to the good against the field.O'REILLY: Right.HUME: And, of course, you know, you have got to figure the others will get something in North Carolina. But, Illinois and --O'REILLY: Missouri.HUME: Missouri come out, that's 121 delegates there.O'REILLY: That's not winner-take-all.HUME: Well, no, it was complicated.O'REILLY: It's complicated.HUME: But it's basically winner-take-all.O'REILLY: Oh, it is.HUME: If he does really well in those two states -- delegates. So, what happens, Bill, as we go forward here and Trump continues to gain delegates on his competitors, what happens is that they then have to -- in order for him not to win, they have to get an ever larger share of the remaining delegates.O'REILLY: Right.HUME: So the odds lengthen against them. That does not mean, however, that by the time he gets to the convention, you know, he will have the 1237 necessary.O'REILLY: Okay. So, you figure Rubio is gone then if he loses Florida, he's down, he's down. OK? Kasich, if he loses Ohio is gone.HUME: I would agree.O'REILLY: All right. But if he wins he stays.HUME: Well, he survives.O'REILLY: But he not going to drop out.HUME: No, I would think he would continue to go on.O'REILLY: Right.HUME: But remember, he will claim momentum. But remember, he is winning his home state where he is very popular.O'REILLY: I know. I know.HUME: I mean, let me say something, if he is a serious candidate, he should win his state. And he should win it easily.O'REILLY: But even if he wins his state, he is still going to be way behind in delegates with no chance of getting enough delegates to win the nomination.HUME: Outright.O'REILLY: So you have got to keep your eye on how many Cruz picks up although he is not favored to win any of the states.HUME: Right. That's true.O'REILLY: But he could do all right. So, at this point though, the Republican Party, they are trying to hope for Rubio, magically winning Florida. That's, I guess, the hope.HUME: What they're hoping for now, I think is, the one way or another, Donald Trump can be prevented from carrying -- having enough delegates to win it outright.O'REILLY: Yes.HUME: And then it goes to the convention and has to be settled there and then they have to figure out then what to do.O'REILLY: If he comes in with real big delegate lead --HUME: Well, this is the problem.O'REILLY: Yes.HUME: Let's assume just for the sake of discussion, Bill.O'REILLY: Right.HUME: That he falls short but he has still got the lion's share of the delegates.O'REILLY: Right.HUME: So, that means the convention hall will have a large plurality of Trump supporters. And the rest of the Republican Party gets together and gives it to somebody else, probably one of the candidates now running, possibly Cruz. How are the Trump delegates going to react to that?O'REILLY: Not well.HUME: How are the people who have been voting for him all along going to react to that in the fall?O'REILLY: Not well.HUME: There is no, you look at this. In any way you can --O'REILLY: Right.HUME: You cannot think of a way this turns out well for the Republicans unless of course Trump wins and wins everybody over between now and then and learns all the issues and does all the things we haven't seen him do.O'REILLY: Right. Yes. He's got to win 65 million of votes to get the presidency.HUME: And he have to do the fancy dancing, to change in that, to satisfy a lot of Republicans to oppose it.O'REILLY: All right.
