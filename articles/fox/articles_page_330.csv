"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" February 20, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Tonight, Rush Limbaugh accuses the Democrats of inventing a whole new voting bloc! Here's Rush Limbaugh.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: The headline, 2012, the year of birth control moms? First came the soccer moms, then the security moms. Will 2012 be the year of the birth control mobs? Or moms. Maybe it's -- that was a good faux pas.Democrat strategerist and pollsterette Celinda Lake says it's enough to really irritate independent suburban mothers and reengage young single women who haven't tuned into the campaign so far -- meaning Santorum and all this talk about contraception, which as you and I know is totally trumped up!Nobody, even now, after all that happened over the weekend, including Santorum -- nobody is suggesting that we ban contraception, particularly at the federal level. That's a totally manufactured issue!You, if you are a regular listener to this program, you know that this all began on February -- or January 7th in a debate, Stephanopoulos, the moderator, asking Romney if he believes in contraception, and Romney -- what the hell is this? Why are you asking me that? That's not an issue! I don't care! Said Stephanopoulos, Would you support the states or the -- banning -- George, it's silly! Nobody's -- but it was on there. It's on the record as asked and answered.And of course, Santorum had previously answered that he thought the states could if they wanted to. He's a states' right guy and was reacting to the question more in a -- in a -- in a states' rights context than he was a contraception context.So they ginned this up because they do not have an issue they can run on! They do not have the economy! They do not have one thing in Obama's record they can point to and say, You want four more years of this, vote for us. So they have to gin something up, and they have done it here.And so now they're going to drum up this -- this -- birth control moms? Isn't that kind of contradictory, a birth control mom? How do you become a mom if you're into birth control? ... I know that after you become a mom and you don't want to do it anymore, fine. But it's all trumped up! There aren't any birth control moms out there!You know, the soccer moms -- if you recall, there really weren't any soccer moms, either. Soccer mom was an invented voting group. And if you recall, the soccer moms were average, ordinary middle class women who drove SUVs and vans. And they just did it all.Oh, my God! They got up, and the moment -- five minutes later, they're fatigued and ready to go back to bed. They had to do make breakfast, get the kids off to school. Pick them up from school. Go to the school play. And then take them to soccer practice, then take them home and feed them, then go to the play, go to ...And Bill Clinton cared more about them than their own lousy husbands did. That was the soccer mom contingent. Their own husbands took them for granted, own husbands couldn't have cared less, but Bill Clinton cared. He cared more about them than anybody in their whole lives. And then the security moms, same kind of creation. Now birth control moms!(END VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: OK! So are birth control moms real? And if they are, how will they impact the 2012 vote? Ambreen Ali from Roll Call joins us. Nice to see you, Ambreen.AMBREEN ALI, ROLL CALL: Thank you. Nice to see you.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, birth control moms -- is there such a group?ALI: I think the -- really, no. I mean, we're having two different kind of conversations right now. On the left, there's this narrative that women's rights groups, women's health is going to be the big issue this election cycle. And I think there's a real effort to try and kind of push this birth control mom narrative, as Rush was alluding to.But on the right, I think that this is not really an issue about birth control at all. The people who are opposed to the president's birth control mandate are doing so on religious freedom grounds. And for them, it's an issue about religious freedom.There's a new poll out that shows that among both Republicans and independents who lean Tea Party, there's great opposition to the president on this issue. And so you're really seeing this fall along partisan lines, as you have -- you know, I don't really see a new constituency here.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, well, how important is the women's vote? If you go back to 2008 -- I mean, how much do these candidates have to reach out to the women?ALI: The women vote is very important particularly because among independent voters, women are in the majority. So...VAN SUSTEREN: By a lot in the majority, or just like...(CROSSTALK)VAN SUSTEREN: Sixty percent? OK.ALI: And in 2008, President Obama won the women's vote by I think about 13 points. So he won by a big margin. But in 2010, women were pretty split between the two parties. So there is kind of a swing vote going on there. And I think that there is potential. If this issue sticks until November, it is very possible that it could be a very important voting issue.But it's important to remember that women, like men, are worried about jobs. Ultimately, this is an election about the economy. And actually, women have lost more jobs than men in the recession. So I don't know if this is going to be the top issue for them.VAN SUSTEREN: I think there's a -- we have a Fox News poll on the top issue in 2008, when the women -- the economy was 66 percent. Health care was 10 percent. So that -- I mean, it does show that they're interested in the economy.All right, now, that's the general election. How about the primary? Any thoughts? I mean, because we have four candidates who are vying for the Republican nomination. Where's the Republican vote? Do we know anything about where it might fall for them?ALI: Well, there's a really big social conservative group, the Susan B. Anthony List, that last week endorsed Rick Santorum. And I think there is a lot of support for Rick Santorum, you know, despite there's been some talk about, you know, whether he's going too far with some of his stances on abortion and women in combat, even this birth control issue.But I do think that there are still a lot of women, particularly socially conservative women, who still back Rick Santorum.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, it's sort of interesting. They're talking about -- I've heard over the last couple days about how enormous number of Catholic women use birth control. And so it's sort of unusual that this would be the issue that they would sort of trying to -- to grab that vote.ALI: Well, Greta, again, it's not really about birth control for them. For them, it's about religious freedom. That's the -- that's really what this narrative is becoming about on the right. And I think the more successful conservatives are in talking about the religious freedom issue and government imposing on that, as opposed to birth control, the more successful they will be.VAN SUSTEREN: So -- and of course, the Democrats are anxious to get it over to the health area.ALI: Right.VAN SUSTEREN: Because it's not -- it's not very strong particularly for them.ALI: Right.VAN SUSTEREN: And you know, it's fascinating that this has become such an important issue. I mean, it's all of a sudden -- I mean, it's become the narrative in the -- you know, we're always -- we're all talking about jobs for so long. And then when the president ran -- when the president changed his rule in terms of HHS in terms of health care about birth control, that completely changed the direction of the discussion.ALI: Yes, and I'm still not convinced that this is bad for the president. I think that talking about this issue instead of maybe job numbers or some of the economic initiatives might actually play out really well for him in the election.VAN SUSTEREN: I don't know because people are -- people are very passionate about this issue. I mean, the -- you know, the -- the viewer e-mail, of course, you know, viewer e-mail can be very skewed, but people are very passionate about this.ALI: Certainly.VAN SUSTEREN: Ambreen, thank you.ALI: Thanks."

How the IRS targeted a Virginia Tea party farmer	" This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" July 25, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: A Virginia farmer and Tea Party member says she knows firsthand that the IRS scandal is very real. Martha Boneta says the IRS is targeting her. She joins us. Martha, we read about your story in The Washington Examiner. You're a farmer out in Virginia, is that correct?MARTHA BONETA, VIRGINIA FARMER/TEA PARTY MEMBER: (INAUDIBLE) Paris.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, and now -- Paris, Virginia. All right, what happened?BONETA: Well, you know, it was my childhood dream to be a farmer and I started farming. I never imagined that, you know, trying to fulfill my dream would involve so many hurdles with, you know, government overregulating. And they actually cited me for having a birthday party on private property for eight little girls.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. That's the -- that's the county.BONETA: Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: So if I get it right, is that the -- there's an environmental group. You have an organic farm.BONETA: Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: But an environmental group and the county were the ones who were sort of going after you and giving you a hard time on a birthday party and some other things on your farm.BONETA: That's correct.VAN SUSTEREN: And at some point -- that's still going on, your sort of dispute or turf war with them?BONETA: Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: At some point, though, all of a sudden, the IRS decides to audit you.BONETA: Yes. And as it's been reported, what was unusual and unique about this is that one of the officials in my county had disclosed that I was the subject of an IRS audit to more than one individual in my county before I ever even received the audit.VAN SUSTEREN: So he -- so -- do you have any idea how this official in the county knew about the audit before you knew about it?BONETA: That's all, you know, part of the investigation right now.VAN SUSTEREN: And in fact, the IRS -- there's an IRS watchdog looking at this, right, or Treasury?BONETA: Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: Now, in terms of the audit that you had, what kind of questions were they asking you in the audit?BONETA: A lot, a large volume of questions. What was unique about this is that some of the questions were directly pertaining to the issues that I had with the county.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, now one of the things the county was upset about, at least (INAUDIBLE) made some allegation you were running a boarding house or (INAUDIBLE)BONETA: Correct.VAN SUSTEREN: Were you running a boarding house there?BONETA: No. Not at all.VAN SUSTEREN: Ever running a boarding house?BONETA: No.VAN SUSTEREN: Why did they think you were running a boarding house, or why did they accuse you?BONETA: That's a very good question, and that was -- that's what made the audit itself unique because the questions were about a boarding facility, whether I had a boarding operation.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, so you have the county asking you or accusing you of having a boarding facility. You said you don't have one. And then suddenly, you have an IRS audit, and they ask you about a boarding house. Now, in your IRS -- in your tax return, did you ever take any deductions or get any -- or any income reflected for a boarding house?BONETA: No. Not at all.VAN SUSTEREN: OK. So this idea of the boarding house comes totally out of -- out of the air.BONETA: Correct.VAN SUSTEREN: Just that other than the fact that the county is asking you the same questions.BONETA: Yes. That's correct.VAN SUSTEREN: Is there -- is there anything else that -- about the IRS investigation that was peculiar?BONETA: Of course, the volume of questions was absolutely enormous. And you know, an auditor did come to the farm and ask me questions while I put eggs into egg cartons.VAN SUSTEREN: So this is -- so this is a -- how many acres do you have at this farm?BONETA: Shy of 70.VAN SUSTEREN: And it's organic.BONETA: Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: And you do farm it yourself or do you have help?BONETA: Yes. Well, we farm it ourselves and we do have, you know, people that help us.VAN SUSTEREN: And how do you get -- how do you sell your products?BONETA: Well, until, you know, recently, people would come to the farm with their families and they would, you know, collect their vegetables and their eggs and their honey, and that's what we did, and you know, before the county came in and started overregulating it and imposing all of these restrictions.VAN SUSTEREN: You're a Tea Party member. What's your affiliation with the Tea Party movement.BONETA: Well, I am a member of the Tea Party, and I'm affiliated with a number of Tea Party groups, you know, throughout Virginia. And you know, most of all, you know, I think that this issue not only affects, you know, Tea Party members, but I think it affects all -- all Americans because nobody should have to live in fear of being targeted because of who they are or what they stand for and what they believe in.VAN SUSTEREN: Have you ever been audited before?BONETA: No.VAN SUSTEREN: This is your first time.BONETA: Uh-huh.VAN SUSTEREN: Is there anything peculiar about your tax return? Is it complex?BONETA: I mean, other than the fact that I have a farm, I don't know that there is anything else particularly unusual about it.VAN SUSTEREN: Martha, was it -- has it been terrifying or scary?BONETA: It's absolutely terrifying. It's terrifying to know that my -- that my IRS audit, my personal private tax returns were even disclosed publicly by somebody before I even became aware of the audit. And the process has been absolutely terrifying for me and my family.VAN SUSTEREN: And I should say they're denying that -- they're saying it's just a mere coincidence.BONETA: Yes. They say coincidences do happen.VAN SUSTEREN: Meanwhile, the -- at least the Treasury IG -- the Treasury inspector general is looking into it.BONETA: Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, good luck, Martha.BONETA: Thank you.VAN SUSTEREN: There are -- you know, there's a lot of complaints about the IRS these days. We're hearing more and more. Nice to see you.BONETA: Thank you. Nice to see you.VAN SUSTEREN: And the president of Linchpins of Liberty saying the only thing phony about the IRS scandal is the Obama administration's response. Kevin Kookogey is -- joins us. Kevin, nice to see you. I should say Kookogey. I always get your name wrong.KEVIN KOOKOGEY, LINCHPINS OF LIBERTY FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT: Thanks for having me back, Greta.(CROSSTALK)KOOKOGEY: Oh, that's all right. It's not an easy one.VAN SUSTEREN: I know, but you know, I've actually...KOOKOGEY: Thanks for having me back.VAN SUSTEREN: I actually practice it, which makes it worse, you know, that I make the mistake. All right, tell me, what do you think -- what's your response to the president saying that this -- these are phony scandals?KOOKOGEY: Well, as you said, the only thing phony is the administration's response because they continue to pretend that they have not violated our constitutional rights. For almost 31 months now, the IRS has unlawfully delayed and obstructed my application for tax-exempt status. They are conditioning our rights on how we choose to exercise them. And the IRS continues to insist that I disclose the identity of the students that I teach, some of whom are minors, the locations where I teach them, and my political views on almost everything possible.VAN SUSTEREN: Has anything changed since the last time you were here on ""On the Record""? I mean, has there been any sort of progress in terms of the -- of your getting the exemption, or has -- have any of your business interests been -- had any sort of impact as a result of this?KOOKOGEY: Well, unfortunately, there has been a huge -- a huge problem with my business in that on June 5th, 2013, which is, incidentally, the day after I last appeared on this program and the day after I testified before Congress, I received a call from one of my dear friends, a long-time client, who expressed such uncomfortableness with my speaking on these political views that they decided that it was no longer appropriate for us to be in business together. So that was 75 percent of my family's business.And if there's something I'd like to say to the administration, is I would like them and Jay Carney and the president himself to tell my family that this is phony.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, the president said on May 15th -- I'll quote from him -- he says, ""I have reviewed the Treasury Department's watchdog report and the misconduct that is uncovered is inexcusable.""Now, I don't know what happened between the inexcusable on May 15th to yesterday and today, where now he says it's phony. So I don't know what happened in between. Any thoughts?KOOKOGEY: Well, he's contradicted himself, as you pointed out. And fortunately for us, Greta, the truth does not depend on what Barack Obama says it is. The truth exists separate and apart from that. And if he doesn't master the truth, the truth will master him.VAN SUSTEREN: How painful is this to you?KOOKOGEY: Well, of course it's painful in the way that it has affected my family, it's affected my business. Remember, before, I had explained that I've also -- as I testified before Congress, I had lost a $30,000 grant.But in addition to that, when you speak the truth without regard to the consequences of speaking that truth for yourself, the inspirational part is that it gives voice to the concerns of many people. And I received after my testimony over 200 emails from people all over the country and including China and Poland who were excited that I was standing up for what I believe.So yes, there's the negative side, but there's also the positive side that someone is standing up. And I'm not the only one, but we're definitely -- there's a group of us who are standing up together, and that gives us strength in numbers.VAN SUSTEREN: Kevin, thank you very much for joining us. And I'll practice again on your name. I hope I do better next time.KOOKOGEY: Thank you so much, Greta. I appreciate it."
5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/04/11/how-obamacare-cloud-will-hang-over-dems-in-2014/	How the ObamaCare cloud will hang over Dems in 2014	"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" April 11, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And joining me now to explain what impact Sebelius's resignation will have on Democrats vulnerable because of ObamaCare in the 2014 midterm elections, from the University for Virginia Center for Politics, Larry. Sabato.Larry, Ed mentioned and referenced, you know, what happened with Sebelius today -- Oops, I can't find the page. Let me play it for you. And is it sort of a symptom of the entire rollout and where ObamaCare is? Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, HHS SECRETARY: Their stories are so heartening about finally feeling secure and knowing they can take care of themselves and their families -- unfortunately, a page is missing.(LAUGHTER)SEBELIUS: So I'm just grateful for having had this wonderful opportunity.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Boy, they didn't need that, especially considering the rollout, right?LARRY SABATO, UNIV. OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS: Yes, I'd like to know what was on that page.(LAUGHTER)SABATO: And who grabbed it.HANNITY: Yes!SABATO: But look, you know, Sean, the important thing is this. Remember when the cabinet officers walk into the State of the Union address? I'm always struck by how completely anonymous they are. Now, Sebelius is better known than most. I think she's leaving now so that most people will forget about her -- forget about her by November.But it doesn't matter. This has been going on for years. The most politically interested and active people who are precisely the people who vote in a midterm election made up their minds about ObamaCare a long time ago. And every recent poll save one has shown that ObamaCare is still unpopular nationally by eight to 12 points, and in the red states, where the Republicans are challenging Democratic incumbents, it's more like 15 or 20. So of course, ObamaCare is going to continue to be a major issue.HANNITY: And it even got as low as 26 percent recently in one poll. Let's go through the history of this. And then my question coming out of it is going to be -- this is ObamaCare. You know, they spent, what, $607 million, had four years go get a Web site up and ready in the years 2011, '12, '13 and '14. They still couldn't get it working right, that astronomical figure. Here's, like, a montage of Kathleen Sebelius' history.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEBELIUS, JUNE 4, 2013: This is an incredibly agonizing situation where someone lives and someone dies.SEBELIUS, JULY 16, 2013: I've got some good news for you. It isn't your typical government website. We've made it, I think, very easy to use.SEBELIUS, OCT. 30, 2013: The website has never crashed. It is functional, but at a very slow speed and very low reliability.SEBELIUS, NOV. 19, 2013: It's been a long time coming.(CROSSTALK)REPORTER: The screen says, ""Sorry, our system is temporarily down.""UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's going to be a -- still continue to be a tough sale, but we'll see how that plays out over the coming months. All right, Secretary Sebelius, thank you so much for being with us this morning. I think we've probably lost sound here or something.SEBELIUS: Well, I can hear you, but I...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.SEBELIUS: Thanks for having me.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Larry, my question is, all the promises, keep your doctor, keep your plan, save money, all these millions of Americans, they're not getting that promise, and then a website that we spent hundreds of millions of dollars on -- do any of these candidates -- are they able to overcome that?SABATO: Personally, I don't think so. Only a few of them are really attempting to defend ObamaCare, spending money to do it or even time on the stump. The smarter ones, frankly, are running away from it and trying to emphasize other issues that might stir the Democratic base.Look, Sean, again, when you look beneath these surface numbers, what you find is this. About two thirds of Republicans are highly motivated to vote because they believe ObamaCare is wrong and it is a very important issue in the campaign.HANNITY: Yes.SABATO: Only about half of Democrats are motivated by ObamaCare and less than half of independents are. So it's Republicans I think that will disproportionally turn out in November and sway the election.HANNITY: A recent poll I saw, we had Karl Rove on the program, had eight Republicans leading and picking up seats.Let's go to the Hannity big board and look at four of them. Larry, I want you to pay close attention. Red state Democrats, we're got Mark Pryor in Arkansas, we've got Begich in Alaska and Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Kay Hagan in North Carolina. Now, of all of these candidates, how many of them put out a statement as it relates to Kathleen Sebelius stepping down? Mark Pryor? No, a big x for Mark Pryor. Begich a big no, same thing with Landrieu, no statement, and Hagan same thing. Is that by design?SABATO: Probably. I'm sure some of them, you know, called her privately and asked that it be kept off the record. Obviously, they don't want to be associated with her and all the glitches in the rollout, and for that matter they don't want to be associated with ObamaCare generally. A few of them are defending ObamaCare. I've noticed that Senator Begich in Alaska has said some favorable things, but, you know --HANNITY: They still voted for it.SABATO: He won six years ago against an indicted Republican who was indicted a week ahead of the election by just a few thousand votes. So I wouldn't exactly call him secure.HANNITY: Kay Hagan, Mary Landrieu, they made the same promises as the president, so.Larry, always good to see you. Thanks for being with us, appreciate it.SABATO: Thanks, Sean.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
