MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Breaking tonight, two major political stories with the potential to change the course of this White House race. Both Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's teams are in full damage control mode tonight after explosive and potentially campaign crippling leaks.  Plus, deadly Hurricane Matthew posing a new threat as it continues its destructive march up the eastern seaboard tonight.  Welcome to a very busy night on ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly on location.   You can call it an October surprise times three.  First, Trump's campaign putting out a statement apologizing, which you do not often hear coming from Donald Trump after the shocking release of an audio recording that captures Mr. Trump making absolutely stunning comments about women about a decade ago.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her.  I'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them.  Like a magnet.  And when you're a star, they let you do it.  You can do anything.  BILLY BUSH, FORMER ""ACCESS HOLLYWOOD"" HOST:  Whatever you want.   TRUMP:  You can do anything.  Grab them by the (bleep).  You can do anything.  (LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  The Clinton campaign is also on defense tonight after Wikileaks puts out excerpts of Mrs. Clinton's well-paid speeches to Wall Street firms which she's refused to make available for months.  And now we may know why. Perhaps it's her reference for her desire for and I quote, ""open boarders"" and there is much more from here.   But first, we must begin with the life threatening course of Hurricane Matthew lashing North East Florida and Georgia with hurricane force winds. And Americans are in danger right now.  The extreme weather being blamed for at least five deaths here in the United States.  Earlier the hurricane weakened to a cat 2 hurricane but the National Hurricane Center reminding people that with hundreds of miles of coastline under threat of torrential rain and deadly storm surge, lives remain very much at risk tonight.  Just listen to the governors whose states are in that path.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. RICK SCOTT, R-FLORIDA:  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have seen hurricane force winds along the coast.  Worst effects are still likely to come.  GOV. NATHAN DEAL, GEORGIA:  There's nothing certain about this other than the danger.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There is nothing safe about what is getting ready to happen.  This is the last time you will hear my voice when I'm asking you to evacuate.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What we feared is now happening in North Carolina.  The immediate concern is now life threatening rain and water.  And I cannot emphasize more life threatening rain throughout our state.   (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Rick Reichmuth, our chief meteorologist is live in the FOX Weather Center tonight.  Rick?RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST:  A lot going on.  We're probably about 50 percent of the way through this storm and you think we've been dealing with it for about 36 hours.  We have about that long to go before it's off or shore.  Hurricane warnings still in effect across northern parts of Florida and now extending all the way up just to the north of Wilmington, North Carolina.  We have a long ways to go.  And one of the biggest things you just hear the governor of North Carolina talking about is the rainfall totals.  And we had incredible flooding just a couple of weeks ago across areas of Eastern North Carolina.  And so, the ground is saturated.  That trees are weaker and we're going to be seeing a lot of rain falling in some sports, probably pushing 15 inches. And this is potentially going to be a catastrophic flooding situation for us across a wide area of South and North Carolina.  We still have the storm surge in the short term.  The storm is moving to the north.  Category two right on the border of category three.  And the pressure is still really low.  Meteorologically, that just means it is still a very strong storm and we're going to watch a lot of water being pushed in across the coast here, especially between Savannah and Charleston.  Savannah, you have seen a surge of almost six feet, fortunately happening at low tide.  It's not going to be the case once we get to Charleston.  And because of that, Charleston is expecting to see the second largest or worst flooding situation that they've seen from a storm behind Hurricane Hugo. And that is saying a lot.  Here is just how this plays out, Megyn.  I want to move through the next couple of hours.  We have incredible rain overnight across South Carolina in the dark.  By the morning mostly done in Georgia.  Throughout the day it moves into North Carolina.  Out of South Carolina by say around 5 o'clock. And then we have this for Saturday night into Sunday.  And finally by around noon on Sunday, we are done with this.  We still have at least 36 hours of this storm across the southeast.   KELLY:  Rick, thank you.  REICHMUTH:  You bet.   KELLY:  Also breaking tonight, just 48 hours out from the next presidential debate and the Trump campaign is in full damage control mode following a troubling story broken by the Washington Post today.  Hour ago, the Post publishing a report along with video of Mr. Trump and NBC's Billy Bush discussing women in what can only be described as vulgar and lewd terms. The video is from 2005.  It appears the men did not realize they were being recorded at the time although clearly they were wearing microphones.  Nevertheless, it is causing major controversy tonight, including a call released just moments by Republican Senator Mark Kirk asking for Donald Trump to drop out of this race.  Trace Gallagher reports from our West Coast Newsroom.  Trace?  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, this controversial tape has been sitting on a shelf at ""Access Hollywood"" for 11 years.  The show says it was just this week, a producer remembered the Donald Trump segment and after reviewing the tape said, the show says, it was working on a story but somehow The Washington Post got a copy of the tape and broke the story first.  On it Billy Bush who now works for the ""Today"" show was about to interview Donald Trump for an ""Access Hollywood"" segment.  The two men were riding in a bus to the set of the soap opera ""Days of our Lives"" where Trump was about to do a cameo.  Trump was already wearing a microphone and you can hear him telling Billy Bush about a woman that he wanted to sleep with.  It's graphic but listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  And I moved on her very heavily in fact I took her out furniture shopping.  She wanted to get some furniture, I said, I'll show you where there is some nice furniture.  I took her out furniture.  I moved on her like a (bleep).  I couldn't get there and she was married.  Then all of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony (bleep) and everything.  And she's totally changed her looks.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  The bus then comes to a stop and Trump and Bush are about to get off and meet actress Arianne Zucker.  But before the doors open the two men start commenting on the actress's legs and how quote, ""hot she is"" with Donald Trump saying, this again graphic.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her.  You know, I am automatically attracted to beautiful.  I just start kissing them.  It's like a magnet.  (LAUGHTER)Just kiss, I don't even wait.  And when you are a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.  BUSH:  Whatever you want.  TRUMP:  Grab them by the (bleep).  You can do anything.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  Trump now says quote, ""This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago.  Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course, not even close.  I apologize if anyone was offended.""  Trump of course has tried to use former President Clinton's infidelity as a campaign issue accusing Hillary Clinton of being her husband's enabler.  Today Mrs. Clinton re-tweeted the Washington Post article and added, quote, ""This is horrific.  We cannot allow this man to become president.""  Democratic VP nominee Tim Kaine said this.  Watch.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TIM KAINE, DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  It makes me sick to my stomach.  This is behavior that is just outrageous.  And so that there would be a new story that would have more statements like this of this kind, I mean, actually, I'm sad to say that I'm not surprised.   (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  And Billy Bush said today he's embarrassed and ashamed and acted foolishly by playing along -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Trace, thank you.  Joining me now, Chris Stirewalt, co-host of ""Perino & Stirewalt: I'll Tell You What.""  Mollie Hemingway is the senior editor at the Federalist.  Howie Kurtz is host of ""MEDIA BUZZ"" on FOX News.  And Nomiki Konst, host of ""The Filter"" on Sirius XM.  Just so our viewers know.  And this isn't to be salacious.  But what Trump said in that clip that we bleeped was that, you can do anything you want when you're a star including grab them by the p word.  That word that has been bleeped out.  You can grab women by the p word. And, you know, as you look at the statements coming in tonight, Chris Stirewalt, Reince Priebus, no woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner, ever.  Mitt Romney coming out the harshest condemnation of this.  And Paul Ryan with whom Trump is supposed to attend an event tomorrow in Wisconsin coming out and saying, he is no longer attending tomorrow's event.  I'm sickened by what I heard today.  This is speaker of the house.  Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified and he goes on from there.  As I mentioned moments ago, Senator Mark Kirk who has been a Trump critic of Illinois, the Republican calls on Trump to drop out of this race and for the emergency rolls of replacing the nominee to be activated.  Give us some perspective on this story.  CHRIS STIREWALT, CO-HOST, ""PERINO & STIREWALT: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT"":  Well, what you just informed me of with Paul Ryan is a great big deal, counselor. Paul Ryan has been the example of the Republican Party stalwart who reluctantly walked in the door with Donald Trump and said, okay, we'll have to do this because he's better than Hillary Clinton.  Now, obviously Ryan is taking a substantial risk here because about 40 percent of the Republican Party is in for Donald Trump no matter what.  Remember, these are people who voted for Donald Trump after he said you have to treat women like the s-word.  This is voters for Donald Trump who after you talk about pigs and dogs and on their knees and all of the stuff that he said when he knew he was being recorded.  So these are voters who are with him no matter what.  Ryan is taking a substantial risk by saying that he won't appear with Trump because that 40 percent of his own party will turn on him and they're going to tear him apart.  So, this is a reflection of some real political courage for him to do that.   KELLY:  Uh-hm.  His statement goes on saying, I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests.  I want to ask you, Mollie, you know, Trump says it's locker room talk, it was a private conversation and that Bill Clinton has said far worse to him on the golf course than what we heard on the tape and says, if I offended anyone, I apologize.  Your reaction to the statement.   MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST:  Well I always love that apology, if I've offended anyone then I apologize.  That's not an actual apology.  At the same time, I'm kind of surprised this is such a big story. Not because it is not horrific, it actually is quite awful, but because I don't really see that much new in the revelations here.  I mean, he's written about in his book, he's talked on Howard Stern about how his sexual libertinism, about how he has slept with married women.  And people knew this going back years.  So, a lot of the outrage is somewhat confusing to me.  At the same time it's audio that is, you know, hot mic reported so it's a little different than the Howard Stern thing. And also, just the sheer entitlement that he exhibits where he just feels where he is entitled as a powerful person to literally grab a woman or what not.  Now, it is also true what he says which is that there has been a lot of tolerance for this type of sexual entitlement among powerful people. And if you oppose these type of powerful people, having sexual entitlement, there aren't a lot of good options at the top of the ticket for either party.   KELLY:  You know, one of the disturbing parts of the tape Nomiki is obviously these two are objectifying women and Billy Bush has come out and said he's embarrassed and he's humiliated, and he wishes he would have behaved better.  But it's the juxtaposition if I may between the way they talk about this woman, this actress on a soap opera Donald Trump is about to appear as she comes up to the bus and then when she greets them, you know, the turn of the switch, she has no idea what they've been saying about her and her body as she walks up.  And then the push by Billy Bush to make her hug Trump who had just been referring to her, you know, just here's a short clip of that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Hello, how are you.  Hi?ARIANNE ZUCKER, ACTRESS:  Hi, Mr. Trump, how are you?  TRUMP:  Nice seeing you.  Terrific!  Terrific!  You know Billy Bush?  ZUCKER:  How are you?BUSH:  Hello, nice to see you.  How are you doing, Arianne?  ZUCKER:  I am doing very well.  Thank you.  Are you ready to be a soap star?TRUMP:  We're ready.  Let's go.  Make me a soap star.  BUSH:  How about a little hug with the Donald?  He just got off the bus.ZUCKER:  Would you like a little hug darling?TRUMP:  Absolutely.  Melania said, this was OK.BUSH:  How about a little hug for the Bushy?  I just got off the bus.  Here we go.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Your thoughts on it.  NOMIKI KONST, HOST, ""THE FILTER"" ON SIRIUS XM:  I mean this is exactly what so many women are aware of that happens.  I mean, yes, it is locker room talk.  It is something that has -- was the norm 20, 30, 40 years ago.  But in an election like this when the stakes are so high, where we're so aware of the disconnect that Donald Trump already has with women, he's down by double digits in comparison to Hillary Clinton with women, even having women so suspicious of Hillary Clinton, distrustful of Hillary Clinton, something like this that shows the juxtaposition as you just said, just refreshes so many memories, that I can bet you every single woman in this country has experienced.  And so to see the person, who is running to be the leader of the free world who says that he's so good with women, who's been denying the charges that were made by Alicia Machado the past week and a half and then the footage comes out, it just reignites all of the suspicions that so many women has felt throughout their careers.  And I'm not underplaying this.  Because it is something that we need to have an open conversation about when men, good-hearted men that we think are good-hearted men enable conversations like that to exist and don't push back, that's a problem.  And that person should not be president.   KELLY:  You know, Howie, already we are seeing pushback by many saying this is not good.  But Bill Clinton has been accused of raping women and sexually assaulting women, and of sexually harassing women.  And that Hillary's attempts to seem astonished and horrified by this kind of talk doesn't ring true to the critics who believe those stories.  In some of those cases, you know, almost seven-figure payouts were made in settlements.   HOWIE KURTZ, FOX NEWS HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"":  And that is classic political deflection, I switch it to Bill Clinton.  Look, this is a big problem for Donald Trump.  And I've been in the camp at the old Howard Stern interviews and the raunchy talk hasn't really made much of an impact because people know that for years and years, Donald Trump was a playboy and an entertainer and he said stuff that he would have been said -- this is different because he starts out talking about he had an unsuccessful attempt to have sex with a married woman, this is after he had married Melania.  And also because the reference when he made the crude reference to you can grab them by the p word, Donald Trump said when you're a star they let you do it.  We just heard that.  You can do anything.  That suggests that he feels that, you know, he is entitled to take what he wants.  And this is not exactly going to appeal to independent or conservative suburban women who Donald Trump very much needs to appeal to in order to close the gender gap going into the Sunday debate in St. Louis.   KELLY:  Yep.  Two things it's been revealed now that the woman he attempted to have the affair with who was married is Nancy O'Dell, reportedly according to reports that have just broken.  That she declined to have an affair with him.  But just on the timing, he made these comments when he was married to Melania.  The tape does not make clear that his attempt to, you know, sleep with Nancy O'Dell happened was while he was married.  It makes clear it happened while Nancy was married, just for the record.  That remains unclear.  We're going to have much more on this panel.  Thank you.  STIREWALT:  Thanks, Megyn.KELLY:  These guys are coming back in the next block.  But the other big, big breaking story tonight involves new headaches for Hillary Clinton after Wikileaks reveals some of what she was saying in those paid speeches that she gave to Wall Street firms, the ones she's been trying to keep private since the beginning of this race.  Chris and Howie are back in a moment with some stunning revelations on what she says in these things.  Plus, David Wohl on that then will join us on how this might play during Sunday night's debate.Plus, the national hurricane center just released some bad news for the folks living in Georgia and the Carolinas.  We're back with that on a very, very busy ""Kelly File"" just ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Breaking tonight, another big story playing out on the 2016 campaign trail in addition to the Trump tape.  And this one involves Hillary Clinton.  Wikileaks published what it claims are transcripts from closed door speeches that Hillary Clinton gave to Wall Street executives two years ago.  Might have had a big impact on the Democratic primary and will lead to new questions at the excerpts -- it will definitely lead to new questions at the debate on Sunday night.  The excerpts include Mrs. Clinton suggesting that Wall Street insiders are best equipped to help reform the sector.  Wall Street insiders are.  How do you think Bernie Sanders would feel about that?  She also conceded that presidential candidates for either party must have tens of millions of contributions from New York to mount a competitive national campaign.  Those were the wrong leads.  Wait until you hear what she says.Trace Gallagher has got the breaking news with some of the highlights. Trace.   GALLAGHER:  Megyn, Hillary Clinton and her campaign have repeatedly refused to release the transcript of her speeches and political analyst say, these leaked excerpts are likely the reason why, including where she apparently called Bernie Sanders supporters a, quote, ""bucket of losers.""  They come from some 2,000 e-mails hacked from the personal account of a top Clinton aide John Podesta, none of which have been confirmed mind you.  They show Clinton campaign researchers trying to flag Podesta about quotes that could be politically damaging.  For example, one that says Clinton admits she's out of touch, referring to a speech she made at Goldman Sachs where she talked about her middle class upbringing and went on to say, quoting, ""So I lived that and now obviously I'm kind of far removed because the life I've made and the economic you know fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy but I haven't forgotten it."" Another red flag came in 2013, a speech to the national multi-housing council where she said, quoting again, ""I mean politics is like sausage being made.  It is unsavory and it always has been that way.  But we usually end up where we need to be.  But if everybody is watching, you know, all of the backroom discussions and the deals you know, then people get a little nervous to say the least.  So you need the public and a private position.""  The aides also flagged comments where Clinton is aware of the security concerns around BlackBerrys, even admitting that everyone at the State Department was being hacked.  Even personal e-mails quoting here again, at the State Department we were attacked every hour, more than once an hour by incoming efforts to penetrate everything we had.  The e-mails also entailed comments indicating she supports the Keystone Pipeline which she publicly opposes.  How she favors single payer or government funded health care, how she thinks Wall Street insiders are what's needed to fix Wall Street and why she supports lowering corporate tax rates and raising the Social Security age.  For the record of the $22 million she made from speeches after resigning as Secretary or State, $3 million came from Wall Street.  So far there has been no comment from the Clinton campaign.  John Podesta thinks he was hack by Russians trying to throw the election to Donald Trump -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Trace, thank you.  Joining us now, Stirewalt and Howie Kurtz are back.  Plus, David Wohl who is an attorney and Trump supporter and Matt Bennett who is co-founder of Third Way, and a former deputy assistant to President Clinton.  Good to see you all.  So, I mean, I don't know where to start. I'll start with this.  My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders in what appears to be a reference to Bernie Sanders' supporters, although while it's absolutely clear is it's people on the left, calling them bucket of losers.  Bucket of losers she refers to.  Matt Bennett, I'll give it to you as the Democrat who worked for President Clinton about, what this tells us about the Democratic nominee.   MATT BENNETT, CO-FOUNDER, THIRD WAY:  Well, it may tell us nothing at all, Megyn.  Because these e-mails come from WikiLeaks which the Homeland Security today said come from the Russians.  We're having a discussion that the Kremlin wants us to have.  They handed this over in an effort to mess around --  KELLY:  It's true these haven't been authenticated.  It's true that -- we don't have verification that these are her words and they haven't been manipulated.  But so far we're not hearing that from team Clinton.  They're not coming out challenging the authenticity yet.   BENNETT:  Well, no, but remember something like 12,000 pages of John's e- mails, John Podesta's e-mails were stolen and put up online by WikiLeaks. So, that's a lot to them to get through in just a few hours and I'm not surprised they haven't commented in any particular thing.   KELLY:  Well, it's an important caveat.  It's true David Wohl, we don't know for sure the authenticity of these documents.  In a court of law these would not be admissible yet.  We'd have to prove that they were authentic. But if they are authentic, these are politically problematic.   DAVID WOHL, LAWYER:  Yes, Megyn, I mean, this will hit Hillary Clinton's campaign like a 9.0 earthquake when this is absorb.  I mean, this exposes her literally as a complete fraud.  And I think the most critical point that was made, I think a transcript on Wall Street, a bank speech is released, and literally Megyn, she said I have two different policies, I have a public policy which I talk to people about and then I've got a private policy which is completely different.  So, what that essentially says is that when I'm campaigning, I will do whatever it takes to get elected.  I'm going to tell them whatever they want to hear, whatever I think they need to hear.  But the truth is going to be held secret.  That is critical, that exposes her as a typical sleazy politician who will do anything to get elected, Megyn.  This is huge.  All ""Kelly File"" viewers have to review this stuff.   KELLY:  The other thing she says Howie is, I'm hoping whatever the shortfalls or glitches in the health care law here in America, those will be remedied and we can keep moving forward to get affordable universal health care coverage like you have here in Canada.  So, she's pushing for Canadian health care, open borders, open trade and on top of that, she acknowledges that the State Department e-mails are being hacked and that they were hacking people's personal e-mails when she was using personal e- mail on a personal server acting as secretary of state.  Talking about thinks that could endanger sources and methods and agents out in the field.KURTZ:  Right.  Well, all politicians have public and private positions. To hear Hillary Clinton who was a big supporter of ObamaCare says, she really wants to move to single payer which is basically government-run health insurance and what she said about bucket of losers, people in the left, do we add that to basket of deplorables for Trump supporters.  That is damaging.  But the most radioactive phrase in here as you note, is open borders.  Because given the sensitivity of the immigration debate and Donald Trump's stand on that and the concerns about terrorism and vetting, that is a radioactive phrase.   KELLY:  You know what Stirewalt?  If you just saw this report -- and on the other night this would have been the lead on the show.  Right?  These Hillary Clinton's e-mails.  STIREWALT:  Sure.KELLY:  But there's the matter of Donald Trump and women.  STIREWALT:  Right.KELLY:  And you'd have to think, wow, does Hillary Clinton have a mole at ""Access Hollywood"" who managed  to release those tapes of Trump on the day that this stuff came out, which as far as we know she does not.  But you know as well as I do that that women story -- and I'm not saying it's not justified.  But that woman story is going to dominate and this is going to be ignored by a lot of the mainstream press.   STIREWALT:  Well, first, apparently the deplorables are drier than the losers.  Because the deplorables you can put in a basket, the losers is going to bucket.  So apparently that say about the right vessel that you need for that group.  KELLY:  Who is not a loser or deplorable, just the people who support her?  STIREWALT:  The deplorable losers are I guess the Bernie Sanders' supporters who have crossed over to vote for Trump and they can go in a thermos inside a basket.  Hillary Clinton after a long time of being very unlucky at politics, in 2008 she was snake bit.  Nothing ever broke her way.  Man she had a great day today.  This comes out, now of course, it could be totally fake, the WikiLeaks --  KELLY:  Yes.STIREWALT:  The Kremlin, dirt baggery a bounce (ph).  KELLY:  Yes.STIREWALT:  But it comes out on the same day that the government says, it's true that the Russians are trying to throw the election and they were trying to throw it for her.  That is the first thing that she's lucky about.  But then just before Julian Assange, and you can just see him like Dr. Evil tinting his fingers for the moment that he's going to hit send that somebody at the Washington Post is like, oh, this is interesting. Boom.  And the Donald Trump stuff --   KELLY:  Look at this tape.  STIREWALT:  Yes.  The Donald Trump stuff because as we mentioned earlier, because it deals with his -- the privilege that he feels to take advantage of women is going to blow this out of the water.  KELLY:  I got to go.  But David Wohl, you're such a Trump supporter, such a loyalist of his.  Can you give us a comment on that tape?WOHL:  You know, Megyn, I'm glad he apologized.  But when you compare to this what Hillary did to Bill's documented actions, not just thoughts or words but Bill's actions against women, sexual harassment, alleged rape, and then she tried to silence the women, she tried to intimidate them, she tried to get rid of them.  She had hired investigators.  There's no real comparison, Megyn.  But I'm glad he said I'm sorry.  Let's move on to substance.   KELLY:  Go ahead, Matt.   BENNETT:  I mean, you got to be kidding.  If there's anybody that's sleazy in this race I think it's pretty clear that it's Donald Trump.   KELLY: And I do have to go but got to ask you this, Chris. Is there any chance that Donald Trump actually is going to drop out and not be the nominee on the ticket?STIREWALT: No, no. He's said worst than -- he said almost as bad as this before. He ain't going anywhere.KELLY: We've never heard the grab...KURTZ: I'm with Chris.STIREWALT: Well, the grab -- that is a new kind of grossness but he said some stuff before. He's in for a penny, in for a pound. The Republicans bought this. They're going to have to ride it all the way down.KELLY: OK, good to see you guys. Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks Megyn.KELLY: Up next, a ""Kelly File"" exclusive, an icon of American film shares a strongly worded message for Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT DE NIRO, MOVIE ACTOR: I mean he's so blatantly stupid, he's a punk, he's a dog, he's a pig.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Former Bush media adviser Mark McKinnon is next on the Robert De Niro message and whether it hurts Mr. Trump or helps him. Don't miss this. You'll see it only here.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well ""The Kelly File"" is tonight getting an exclusive look at a strongly worded message from one Hollywood icon. And the man does not mince words. While one legendary actress off the cuff comments for an ad campaign wound up on the cutting room floor of the get off the vote effort, we have obtained an exclusive look at this actor's comments and you know him very well. And here are Robert De Niro's thoughts on Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DE NIRO: I mean he's so blatantly stupid. He's a punk. He's a dog. He's a pig. He's a con. A (Bleep) artist, a muck who doesn't know what he's talking about, doesn't do his homework, doesn't care, thinks he's gaming society, doesn't pay his taxes. He's an idiot. Colin Powell said it best. He's a national disaster. He's an embarrassment to this country. It makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo has wound up where he has.He talks about how he would like to punch people in the face. Well, I'd like to punch him in the face. This is somebody that we want for president? I don't think so. What I care about is the direction of this country. And what I'm very, very worried about is that it might go in the wrong direction with someone like Donald Trump. If you care about your future, vote for it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Mark McKinnon served as the chief media adviser to President George W. Bush and is now the co-creator and co-host of the weekly documentary series ""The Circus"" on Showtime. Mark, good to see you. I mean, you know, De Niro is beloved. He's beloved in the country. You know, he's played such iconic roles and to see him come out so forcefully and denounce Trump in those terms, you tell me whether it has any effect.MARK MCKINNON, POLITICAL ADVISER: Well, what people really want to see on television and advertising of politics is something that's authentic. Most of the advertising they see they just start on (ph) believing they don't believe any of it. They think it's all paid for. It's all scripted. Well, that's obviously not scripted. That's passionate.It's from the heart. It's totally authentic so, anything that communicates something that's authentic and heartfelt and passionate is good. I mean, they should get that off the cutting room floor and put that on television because that's powerful. I mean, it's sort of Trump-like in the way that it's unvarnished and peels the pain off. But that's the kind of thing that voters actually want to see.They're tired of scripted stuff off Teleprompters. That's the real thing and that's what people want to see. That's what's powerful today in politics, something that's authentic and unscripted.KELLY: But does it have any effect, I mean, we know that the Trump voters, his fan base, they're not going to care about that. In fact, Robert De Niro is going to get mean tweets in two seconds from now. But does it have any effect on the people, the swayable middle?MCKINNON: Well, he's a Hollywood icon as you said and people just assume that his politics are pretty lefty any way so, no. It's not going to do much except that he's giving a passionate voice to people on the left and what people on the left need right now is to be energized. Hillary Clinton needs to energize that base. She wants to have the turnout up and so far it hasn't been particularly enthusiastic.So, given this tape, given the last week, given De Niro -- De Niro is just giving voice to people saying, come on, this real. This is a real threat. And he's giving energy and passion to a lot of the voter base that Hillary Clinton has been unable too articulate like De Niro can.KELLY: I can't let you go without asking you what you make of the news, the Trump tape and the Hillary WikiLeaks, you know, again not yet authenticated but not yet denied by the campaign either.MCKINNON: Well, it's going to make for a spectacular debate because, I mean, first of all Donald Trump has to show -- you know, it's going to be front and center. He has to show contrition, empathy, remorse. I mean he's got to deal with that front and center somehow or dominate (ph) the whole debate and then the news cycles. But the WikiLeaks issues give the Trump campaign a whole treasure trove of very good issues to attack her on that night. So, they've got a lot to go on too. Good for both of them.KELLY: If I were Trump, I'd be studying up over the next 40 hours, studying a lot. Studying WikiLeaks. Great to see you, Mark.MCKINNON: Hey, Happy Anniversary. Kick it hard.KELLY: Thank you. Kick it hard. Well, Larry Sabato is up next on the new polls that just got dropped. We'll give you the state of the election next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: We are now 32 days away from electing the next president and just two days away from a showdown that could prove critical for both candidates on Sunday night. With brand new Fox News polls released just hours ago showing Hillary Clinton maintaining her lead over Donald Trump by a margin of 48 to 44 percent. Joining me now, Larry Sabato, founder and director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Larry, what do you see in the new round of polls? Fox News and Quinnipiac both have them out.LARRY SABATO, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS DIRECTOR: Megyn, there's stability, surprising stability. Hillary Clinton's polling averages in the four way are about 3 percent. Her polling average lead in the two way as you just noted is 4 or 5 percent. So, the Fox News poll is right there with the averages.KELLY: What trends if any are you seeing now?SABATO: I'm seeing a holding action at least until the second debate which ought to be incredible on Sunday night given all of the new information and issues. This is the busiest campaign ever. You can't even go to a movie on a Friday night.KELLY: You shouldn't be doing that anyway. You should be watching ""The Kelly File.""SABATO: I know. I record it.KELLY: In the last Fox News polls, it shows Trump is up 13 points with men, Hillary is up 11 points with women but it actually shows that he gained 3 points with women in the past week. So he -- maybe it was the Pence debate, who knows, but he made a little bit of progress with the women in the past week, then came today. But you tell me whether there's any historic precedent for a candidate making up that kind of lost ground between now, you know, in a month's time with one major voting block.SABATO: I think it's very difficult. And you know, Megyn, we're headed for the gender gap of all gender gaps. It's going to be the biggest gender gap since we've been able to measure it, since we've had the instruments to measure it. And I don't think that's going to close up very much on either side, men being for Trump, women being for Clinton before November 8th.KELLY: It's been fascinating to see. I mean, obviously she's a woman and he's a man. But this election involves so many other gender issues beyond the sex of those actually on the top of the ticket. Larry, great to see you.SABATO: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Up next, it's the 20th anniversary for Fox News Channel. We have some of the most memorable moments we've shared with you coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well it's a big day here at Fox News. Twenty years ago today, Fox hit the air waves for the very first time. Yes, thank you, right. Yours truly joined the team back in 2004 and three years ago today, we launched ""The Kelly File."" Here's a look back at some of our most memorable moments here over the years.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS AMERICA'S NEWSROOM SHOW CO-HOST: Welcome and good morning. The premier day for ""America's Newsroom."" I'm Bill Hemmer on with Megyn Kelly, now in New York City and welcome to you.KELLY: Thanks so much buddy. I am pumped up to be here.Tell me how is it fair?ANTHONY WEINER, NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: Ready?KELLY: I am.KELLY: Did you kill little Lisa?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.KELLY: Do you believe she's still alive.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, absolutely.KELLY: Were you drunk?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah. Still not real that my little girl, so full of life and who wants a horse so badly and was going to get (inaudible) for Christmas, isn't coming home.KELLY: And that's what you, isn't it? You would get into this child's bed and you would remember all of the things you loved about them.What makes you dominant and me submissive and who died and made you scientist-in-chief?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know what the outcome is going to be but you should -- we got to be careful about calling things.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, maybe not so fast.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks a lot.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's great to have you guys here.KELLY: That's awkward.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right, it is going to go to the decision desk and interview them about the decision on Iran.KELLY: Now we're in the heart of the decision death room.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're actually quite comfortable with the call in Ohio.KELLY: Welcome to the very first broadcast of ""The Kelly File"" live from the heart of New York.There's no losing and actually we're getting rid of any sports in our school that where one person lives and the other person loses. You say that (inaudible) you say actually when you play cards with your grandkids, you let them lose. If they lost, they lost.BARBARA BUSH, FORMER FIRST LADY: Well, I do. I mean, I don't annihilate them.EZEKIEL EMMANUEL, OBAMA ADVISER: Whether you can anticipate what business would do is irrelevant. The Affordable Care Act...KELLY: Stop saying that because I'll tell you what's relevant to my viewers. I think I know my viewers and I think they think this is relevant.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it would be a fair imbalance to also look at the violence that was in use going on perpetrated by the government, by the official agencies in ordinance of the government.KELLY: Let me just tell you what I hear when I hear that. I hear you saying you sound like with respect to Osama Bin Laden.You understand that Al Qaeda routinely kills civilians. I mean, this group ISIS routinely kills civilians...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you asking me if I am a supporter of Al Qaeda.KELLY: You certainly sound like you like them.JOHNNY CARSON, NBC TONIIGHT SHOW HOST: You seem pretty straight down the line. How do you deal with that?KELLY: I am. Thank you. I'm a straight news anchor. I'm not one of the opinion hosts at Fox, but I always laugh because, you know, I'll have a conservative pull me aside and say, I love your conservative principles, and I'll say, you assume too much.What do you say to those who say you were so wrong about so much at the expense of so many?How did you first learn that there was a problem with Josh?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For days and days I was saying, you know, Josh has done a very bad thing. And he's -- he's very sorry.When did you actually become a Republican?TRUMP: I don't think they like me very much.KELLY: Afterward you said that you didn't feel that the moderators had been nice. Do you think it's the journalist's role to be nice to presidential candidates at a debate?KELLY: The honeymoon is potentially on between Trump and the party.STIREWALT: This isn't the honeymoon. This is like the first long week that a couple spends together. Nobody belches. Everybody is on their best behavior. They're trying really hard to be somebody they're not. So, they're not at the honeymoon yet. They're just at that cabin wih the hot tub for the weekend.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hillary was once so worried about what information Julian Assange might leak, she once allegedly inquired ""can't we just drone this guy?"" A fact check website says that claim is unproven, Megyn.KELLY: The fact that Trump has put ramps in his building is required by law. He doesn't get extra credit for that. You have to.DAVID WOHL, TRIAL ATTORNEY: But they're very expensive in his buildings, Megyn.KELLY: Oh my god.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYING)KELLY: And I would say that Jimmy Fallon is great and also he copied me.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you mean?KELLY: Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CCLIP)KELLY: See, there's no receding hairline there.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: I'm going to do it too. See you. We'll be right back.""Settle for More"" is the name of my book it is coming out November 15th and it's based on my own life philosophy which is based on Dr. Phil's. Finally the light bulb went off. I can settle for more, I can change my life and I did.PHIL MCGRAW, TV HOST: And boy did you ever.KELLY: Today, my nana, mother of two, grandmother of five, great grandmother of 11 turns 99 years young.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Are you happy to be 99?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I'd rather be 29.KELLY: You were very beautiful.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, I know.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: You were beautiful then and you still are.See you at 9 p.m. This is ""The Kelly File.""

2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/03/11/bill-oreilly-personal-attacks-in-republican-primaries/	Bill O'Reilly: Personal attacks in the Republican primaries	"Some Americans are dismayed about all the personal insults being used in the republican campaigns. Well, we will see if that happens again tonight in the debate.There is no question, however, that Donald Trump supporters expect him to be an avenger. A man who will go on the attack if he believes it is necessary. But, that does not hold true for the other candidates and the best example is Marco Rubio.After being soundly defeated on Tuesday, Senator Rubio is holding a last stand in his home state of Florida. His poll numbers are down and some analysts believe it's because he used personal invective against Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R-FL) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is making fun of me for wearing makeup. So, how can it be, how can a person with the worst spray tan in America.(LAUGHTER)Attack me for wearing on -- Twitter. Attack me on twitter for wearing makeup. The other night he was worried about the lines around the state. Remember that? What he needs to be worried about is the lines around his eyes from this horrible spray tan.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now, after last week's debate in Detroit, I asked Senator Rubio about the insults.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Do you regret the school boy stuff with Trump, you know, the wet pants business and all that? Do you regret it?SEN. RUBIO: You know, it is not -- I don't regret it in the sense that --O'REILLY: No?SEN. RUBIO: No. I will tell you why, because if anyone deserves to be hit for that, it's him. He merely spent a year doing that.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now was before the Tuesday vote, of course. And, now, Mr. Rubio has changed his opinion. He says he will not use personal attacks any longer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RUBIO: If that is what it takes to become President of the United States, then I don't want to be president. I don't think that's what it takes to be president. In fact, I know it's not what it takes. It's not what we want from our next president. And, if I had to do it again, I would have done that part differently, but not about the stuff about his record on business.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: I got a letter from James Sanford who does live in Florida, saying that Rubio lost her support, quote, ""When he jumped in the gutter with Trump,"" unquote. ""Talking Points"" believes that sometimes, you have to fight fire with invective but context matters.Ted Cruz will use some personal stuff but it is mostly around issues and behavior. John Kasich does not do it at all. American voters vary in this arena. Mr. Donald Trump has gained support for his scorched-earth approach, but he also has alienated many folks; thus, his high unfavorable ratings in the polls.Trump, himself, on phased by that believing his approach has stifled his competition and will put Hillary Clinton on the defensive. But, a guy like Marco Rubio, a more traditional politician, apparently can't get away with flamboyant attacks as Trump has in bullying voters.It didn't work for Jeb Bush either. Although, the governor's heart was never really in the personal attack mode. Summing up totally unique primary campaign, where traditional rules do not seem to apply at least on the G.O.P. side. For the democrats, pretty much politics as usual.And, that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years. He joined the network in 1996 and is based in New York. Click here for more information on Bill O'Reilly. "
