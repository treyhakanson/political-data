"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" August 13, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)       JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.: I disagree with those who say this shows what a hawk Hillary Clinton is, what a moderate. I think that is essentially misreading her real philosophy. But I think she is reading the polls and say I've got to have distance between myself and Obama, and it's because he's incompetent and I'm not.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you going to hug it out with the president?HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Absolutely. Yeah, we're looking forward to it. We're going to be there tonight. We have disagreements as any partners and friends as we are might very well have. But I'm proud that I served with him and for him and I'm looking forward to seeing him tonight.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHANNON BREAM, ANCHOR: Some public criticism, maybe a private make up. Let's talk about it with our panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, you're back, welcome back, Ron Fournier, senior political columnist of National Journal, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. All right, gentlemen, a lot to consider here, because there is a question for Hillary Clinton, Steve, about how this looks. They say they are going to hug it out tonight. We won't see any pictures. There won't be full coverage or anything like that. So does it look, though, opportunistic if she's too critical of the president at this point? Does she risk that?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yeah. I mean, I think it looks opportunistic. She's in a sort of a can't-win position because it looks opportunistic no matter what she does now, and that's in part because what we've heard from her and her spokesmen - her representatives has been absurd. At first she comes out and she gives what I think is probably pretty close to her real views on Syria, on a number of issues, and she's critical of President Obama, more critical than she's been in the past.And then you have her spokesman come out and try to clean this up and patch it up, and, you know, where Hillary Clinton said, you know, basically don't do stupid stuff is not an organizing principle. Her spokesman comes up and said that wasn't in reference to President Obama. Well, of course it was a reference to President Obama. Those are his words. Who else would it be a reference to?And I think, this kind of dispute, the kind of positioning that we're watching here, the video you just played of Hillary Clinton pretending they are best buddies, this is why people hate Washington. It's totally phony all the way around, and it's what I think we can come to expect for the next two years.BREAM: Well, and Ambassador Bolton there said if you think she's suddenly turned more hawkish, it's not about that. She sees the polls and she wants it to be that he's incompetent but she's competent. Speaking of one of those polls, a brand new Fox News poll is out tonight, and this is a light-hearted one, but it was about your summer vacation. Would you rather spend your summer vacation with Hillary and Bill, Michelle and Barack, or neither? Hillary and Bill 42 percent, Michelle and Barack way back at 25 percent. Ron, is she reading these polls? Maybe not this one, it just came out, but if she's watching.RON FOURNIER, SENIOR POLITICAL COLUMNIST, NATIONAL JOURNAL: Yeah she is and I agree with Steve. You, know if you can't be honest about your honest differences, what are you going to be honest about. You're exactly right. Her position is what she said to my colleague Jeff Goldman at The Atlantic. It was a smart, well-informed, consistent criticism of the president. And it might even be right. Her problem is, as you say, she backed off of that.And my problem is yesterday, I wrote a column saying she's being smart, she's being authentic, and unless I'm being naive, she's being authentic here and she's doing -- she's being honest. It wasn't three or four hours she puts out a statement and I had to retract. I had to do a correction in my column saying I was naive because she's not being authentic. She's being phony.  She's playing politics.Actually, if she really was looking at the polls, the smart thing to do is be consistent what she did the first time out, because most Americans actually aren't as hawkish as she is. Most of the base, the Democratic base is certainly to the left of she is. So, she's not only doing bad politics now, but she's looking inauthentic doing it. I can't figure it out.BREAM: All right, a couple of other polls here just out tonight as well about confidence in President Obama's ability to make the right decisions for the U.S. -- 52 percent say they are confident in his ability, 47 percent say not confident. And then we get to his job performance, President Obama's job performance, 42 percent approve, 49 percent disapprove. Now, Charles, he and the White House have got to be thinking about his legacy. But Hillary Clinton may be thinking about being president.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, that's why we're getting the hug-in tonight. Let me just say, the country is already in the grips of an epidemic of hugging. And such a public and open display of hugging, I think can only make things worse. So I would deplore it on those grounds alone.BREAM: Hugging make things worse?KRAUTHAMMER: There's much too much of it going on in the country.BREAM: You heard it hear.(LAUGHTER)FOURNIER: So there will be no hugging at this table.BREAM: Charles is anti-hugginh.KRAUTHAMMER: Save the Grinch. But as you guys were saying, this is such a blatant display of Clinton inauthenticity. It's breathtaking. She did finally appear to say something that she believes and then of course retracted it.But remember, with these people, meaning the Clintons, do you ever know if they are saying anything sincere? Remember the last time she ran, she decided as she told Bob Gates, the former secretary of defense, openly, that she opposed the surge in Iraq, the one that was successful, for political reasons, which shocked Gates to hear because she was up against Obama, the anti-war senator in the Iowa primary. So she moved left the last time around. And now because she's not going to face a serious challenge on her left, she is now maneuvering to the center for her current run and expressing more hawkish opinions than the Obama administration.So you never actually have any idea of what is the core belief. And I think if she finally ended up saying that you thought was inauthentic and withdraws it with a hug within a day, she's in trouble.FOURNIER: Her problem has never been her policies. Her problem in 2008 wasn't that she was too right or too left. It was that people didn't believe that she believed anything. This inauthenticity issue is her biggest bugaboo, and she ran right into it with that statement yesterday.BREAM: And after giving an interview, apparently some from her camp reached out to the White House. They know that something was going to come from this and sort of gave a heads up to the White House, saying there is this interview is coming out, reportedly. And after it came out she, herself, called the president apparently yesterday. So Steve, she seems like a very intelligent woman. She's not new to politics. So at what point did she decide what she said was something she wish she hadn't?HAYES: Look, I've said this here before. I don't think she's good at politics.  I think she's an overrated public official. People are saying now she's unpolished. She hasn't been working her political muscles. I think that's nonsense. I don't think she was that good in 2008. I don't think she's that good now.The problem she faces is the dynamic that she's in the middle of that we're seeing play out right now is unlikely to change any time soon because her challenge is that she needs to create distance from the president and his foreign policy because it's a disaster and because it's unpopular, he's getting low marks, as we showed on the screen. But she played a huge role in formulating that. She was his top foreign policy adviser for four years.  And, I think, crucially, as Charles suggests, the Democratic base still believes in what President Obama is doing. That's where she's going to need to win if she's going to win the Democratic nomination, if she runs.  She's going to need that support. So she can't go off on President Obama for those reasons.FOURNIER: Let's talk a little bit about President Obama. Why is the President of the United States so thin-skinned that he can't let his former secretary of state, who he owes and allegiance to, can't let her say maybe we should have armed the Syrian rebels? She even said I don't know how it would have turned out, but I think we should have done it. He couldn't even let her get away with that. He had to sic his attack dogs on her, a very 1990s, old kind of politics thing to do, and this is supposed to be the man who is above all that.(CROSSTALK)BREAM: Legacy, as we discussed.FOURNIER: Let the policy rule your legacy. Your legacy shouldn't be that you're beating up --HAYES: He can't afford to do that.KRAUTHAMMER: And all this is happening with Putin on the march, ISIS on the march, Kurds and others perishing on mountain tops, and he's concerned over a line from Hillary, the former secretary of state. And you're right -- so thin-skinned he has to respond. You would hope he responds to some of the crisis.BREAM: Thank you panel. Speaking of Putin, next up, Russia, Ukraine, and a surprising statement from our defense secretary.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: This is a Fox News alert. New threats against U.S. consulate in Istanbul. These new threats forcing the U.S. State Department to cancel consular services which includes the issuing of visas. And the State Department saying it has information about a possible security threat and are encouraging Americans in Turkey to remain vigilant.Back here at home, President Obama's plan to take out ISIS under intense criticism. Critics say the obvious. ISIS is growing and growing, so the President's plan can't possibly be working.Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee of New Hampshire, Senator Kelly Ayotte goes ""On the Record."" She is right here. Senator, that was my thought. They are growing and growing, whatever we are doing isn't working.KELLY AYOTTE, NEW HAMPSHIRE SENATOR: Well, I would agree, Greta. And, you know, I think what we heard on Sunday night, was we certainly heard a lecture but we didn't hear changes on what's going to make the difference to defeat ISIS in terms of the current strategy.Nothing new. Stay the course. And so, I think we need to be much stronger if we want to make sure that we reduce their safe haven in Iraq and Syria. And, frankly, we had some stepping up of air -- the air campaign but it needs to be much stronger.We've got a situation where, frankly, I've been surprised that the president actually hasn't even called together NATO to say, OK, post -- post-terrorist attacks and obviously with...(CROSSTALK)SUSTEREN: Well, I don't know why France didn't invoke article 5.AYOTTE: Right.SUSTEREN: And I don't know why Turkey didn't invoke article 5 as -- I mean, no one anybody has, or why we haven't come.AYOTTE: And we have an ability even sort of invoking Article 5 to bring -- to actually under Article 4, call a NATO meeting.(CROSSTALK)SUSTEREN: A meeting.AYOTTE: A meeting on how are we going to work together to defeat ISIS and bring in up to a coalition.SUSTEREN: I'd step it up to -- I'd step it up to five but that's just me. All right. What are generals saying though, and what does the military saying?AYOTTE: Well, I think the military; we're going to hear tomorrow from Secretary Carter on this issue. But what I think is that we need to obviously have rules of engagement. And especially on the air campaign that's starting to change. That really make sure that we're focusing on the right targets.We saw that when they took out the 116 oil trucks, but obviously that was way too late. We need to do more of that. We also need, I believe, Greta, a lot of these sorties are coming back where they don't drop the bombs.And the way you avoid that is more forward air controllers J-techs to actually embed with the Kurds. Embedded with the Iraqi forces so that we can call an accurate air strikes to go after the best targets. And then more support for the Kurds, more bringing together our allies to really take ISIS out.SUSTEREN: Well, the Pentagon, one of the other issues of course, I'm sure you know is all the talk today about Donald Trump, and even the Pentagon had something to say to him about national security. Let's listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER COOK, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: We have troops serving that follow the Muslim faith. And, again, without wading into politics, anything that tries to bolster, if you will, the ISIL narrative that the United States is somehow at war with Islam is contrary to our values and contrary to our national security.(END VIDEO CLIP)SUSTEREN: Islam -- are we at war with Islam, radical Islam or nobody?AYOTTE: Well, let me just say, Greta. I firmly believe to the -- to the statement that was just made, I respect all of our service members, regardless of what their religion is. We shouldn't have a religious base test on either immigration or service. But this administration...(CROSSTALK)SUSTEREN: We also have a constitutional amendment.AYOTTE: Exactly. It's called the First Amendment to the Constitution and it needs to be respected. But that said, we are, if you look, radical Islamist terrorists and the president has not been willing to say that. And we have to be clear that this is the enemy. And we need to make sure that we do everything we can to defeat ISIS, and obviously other terrorist groups like Al Qaeda that still remain a threat to us.And, to me, the president has not been clear and certainly that wasn't clear on Sunday night either.SUSTEREN: I think it's fair to say radical Islam and I mean, I will make a comment at the end of the show about it, I think is actually very destructive to trying to beat ISIS. And I will explain it at the end of the show, so you have to stay tuned.(CROSSTALK)AYOTTE: I appreciate that.SUSTEREN: Anyway, Senator, nice to see you. Thank you.AYOTTE: Thank you."	['Ayotte']	[]
