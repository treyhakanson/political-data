This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" My next guess says terrorism and repression of women and the persecution of people with different faiths are all part of an ideology that is embedded in Islam. And she says that the only way to put an end to it all is to reform the Muslim religion. She is a New York Times bestselling author whose brand new book ""Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now"" is on bookshelves now. She's in studio, Ayaan Hirsi Ali. How are you?AYAAN HIRSI ALI, AUTHOR, ""HERETIC"": Great, thank you for having me.HANNITY: You say Islam is not a religion of peace. I say that, I'm an Islamophobe. You know for a fact that it's not a religion of peace. Why do you say that?ALI: I say it's not a religion of peace now because if as a religion you're responsible for 70 percent of all of the bloodshed in the world today, then you possibly cannot be a religion of peace. But it could become a religion of peace if we make some changes, and I'm proposing only five.HANNITY: All right, so you want to make the change. I want to bring in the politics a little bit. Hillary Clinton takes money, countries like Saudi Arabia, women can't drive, can't vote until 2015 for the first time, can't be seen in public without male relatives, the morality police. Why would she take money from a country that treats women that way and then claims she stands for women?ALI: So what I want to do is stay away from politics, but stay out of politics, I want to stay out of the whole presidential --HANNITY: Doesn't that say something, though?ALI: What it says is in the past the United States of America regardless of who was in the White House, who was in Congress, were allying ourselves with despots. We were allying ourselves with people who wanted us in harm's way, who were saying the worst things about the United States of America, and that now we need to change that.HANNITY: Women in particular are -- ALI: Women in particular.HANNITY: -- treated like property.ALI: Absolutely. HANNITY: Treated horribly.ALI: Yes.HANNITY: OK. And this is all women under Islam?ALI: If you live in Saudi Arabia, you can't drive. If you live in Saudi Arabia -- HANNITY: But that's one country. Iran is not any better.ALI: -- you can't get out of the house. Iran is not any better. Any country that applies sharia law and the movement across the Islamic world that are applying sharia law, they are -- anywhere where sharia law is applied as a woman, as a gay person, as a Christian, as a Jewish person, it's impossible to live and be free and not fear for your life.HANNITY: Do you think most Muslims, most, if not all, because I keep saying where are the moderate Muslims speaking out about the radical Islamists? I think there are too few voices. Do you think that's because people believe silently, maybe they don't involve themselves, but silently they agree with the radical interpretation?ALI: I just think the term ""moderate"" is completely and utterly useless. And that is why I use these three different terms. You either follow the Prophet Mohammed in the Koran in that example in Mecca, in Medina, or you become a dissident, a heretic, somebody who wants to --HANNITY: An apostate.ALI: An apostate, whatever label they want to --HANNITY: The penalty for which is death.ALI: It is death. It's ostracization. But there are brave people out there who are putting their lives on the line to change things from within.HANNITY: And the last question. So you think that -- do you think this is possible? Because it seems to me the numbers that buy into radicalism are high. And they take a real literal interpretation of the Koran, do they not?ALI: I am a brand new American. I am an optimist. 1989 happened, we defeated national socialism, we defeated communism. Protestants and Catholics are at peace with one another. If you believe in that human story, you will believe in the human story of an Islamic reformation. And as Americans, I think we need to lead that.HANNITY: All right, the book is fantastic. Thank you for being with us, appreciate your time.ALI: Thank you.HANNITY: All right, when we come back, it's about spring break. We want your input. Our ""Question of the Day"" is next.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.NY DAILY NEWS SUGGESTS GOP IS DEAD AND DONALD TRUMP KILLED IT; SOME REPUBLICANS BURN VOTER REGISTRATION CARDS AFTER TRUMP'S INDIANA WINGina Loudon:  I would ask the people that are burning their cards, were they declaring the GOP dead when McCain was the nominee, or Romney or Dole? I think we need to get things in perspective. But having said that, my background's in psychological and there are a couple of interesting psychological phenomenons taking place. One is stages of grief. Trump advocates need to be patient with the people, the Republicans especially, who are yet to come around.  Juan Williams: This is a fight among Republicans. It's a family fight. There are so many policy issues and specifically, since this is Cashin' In, let's talk about trade, where Republicans have long been advocates of free trade. Donald Trump is not on that side of the fence.  He is not about having America be a strong, military presence in the world.  He wants to pull back from NATO, and from Asia in terms of nuclear protection.  Jonathan Hoenig:  Trump's a business man, but he doesn't support capitalism. He supports tariffs.  That's why a lot of people, call them the establishment if you want, let's just say voters, are wondering what is this guy about?  Is he going to support capitalism? Is he going to support a mixed economy?  Morgan Ortagus: You know it's interesting. I almost think this Republican, Democrat conversation is passe. I think we have to look at a new paradigm. For the past few decades, Americans, in every single poll they're asked, they're frustrated and sick of the two-party system. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have blown up the two-party system and may both make their parties weaker, but I think that's actually good. I think that's actually good for America.ANGRY WOMAN CONFRONTS MAN AT WALMART FOR USING 'GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE' TO BUY FOODJonathan Hoenig:  This would infuriate me as well. I'm proud of this woman.  She's absolutely right. You have every right to keep every cent of your money. It's not government's decision to redistribute as it sees fit, to pick winners and losers. I wish the Republicans; I wish Trump was consistent on this one. I hate having my wealth redistributed for special political favors.  Juan Williams:  This guy is hard working.  50 to 60 hours a week, so I guess you guys want to raise the minimum wage so he can, in 50, 60 hours, earn enough money to support his family. Remember, we're not talking about food stamps here. We're talk about assistance for women and children and families.  Now, if you think that's giving money to an undeserving soul, I disagree.Morgan Ortagus: I'm from the south and I think I'm just old school, but the fact that the two of them were fighting and putting the f-bomb out there in front of a child. It really bothered me. I thought why in god's name would they sit there and argue with each other at a grocery store. Who behaves that way? I think they were both acting like children. You can have very strong beliefs on economic policies, but what happened to civil discourse in this country and being respectful and compassionate to each other? You shouldn't curse in front of children.  Gina Loudon: I thought that, the whole conversation could have had a lot more diplomacy and been more effective. Civil discourse has to be the name of the game these days and we've sort of lost that as a culture. But to this woman's point, I call this plantation politics because this is the kind of program that is outside the purview and scope that government was ever intended to be. This guy should be getting help from a church or charity or his family or his friends or his neighbors. Not from government.DOJ PROGRAM NO LONGER USING 'CONVICT' OR 'FELON' WHEN REFERRING TO CRIMINALSMorgan Ortagus: What's next? Are we going to call rapists, people who committed raped? Are we going to call terrorists, humans who committed terrorist acts? Title 18 of the federal government, is the criminal and penal code. So there's a reason why, in our laws, we refer to people as criminals and felons.  There's no need to change that and I'm really worried. When does it stop?  Juan Williams:  No, to me, this is not PC per se, because when you think about, for example, how we refer to people with disabilities or mental illness, you don't go around  calling them names that in fact  keep them in some kind of lower status in society. And we know about the ban the box movement because when people are labeled as convict, it impacts their ability to get work.  Jonathan Hoenig:  I don't have a lot of respect for convicts. I don't think they're deserving of a lot of respect. The problem is that we make a lot of felons here. I think like 50 percent of people in federal prisons are there for nonviolent offense, mostly drug offenses. So let's stop making so many criminals. But violent people, they're incarcerated because they act like animals. They're locked up because they infringe on people's rights and I don't respect that one bit.Gina Loudon: I have a problem with the word served, because people serve in the military. When you are doing your time, you're not serving anything. Secondly, the PC police need to get a hobby because this is not a cause and if anyone were to make these decisions and change this language, I think let's let the families and victims of the criminals make a decision.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Personal Story"" segment tonight, the war on American women true or fabricated. It looks like Hillary Clinton will reprise the war on women concept that President Obama used in the last election.With us now Carly Fiorina, republican presidential contender. Let's get right to the Planned Parenthood thing. It's pretty outrageous. And I think Hillary Clinton is going to have to step up and say something.CARLY FIORINA (R), 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, she hasn't said a word.O'REILLY: No, nothing.FIORINA: You talk about a war on women. I mean, think about this, Democrats like Hillary Clinton, have argued against giving women a chance to look at an ultrasound before they have an abortion, but they are prepared to use ultrasound to figure out figure out how to best preserve the body parts of an unborn child that they have convinced women is not a life at all.O'REILLY: Right.FIORINA: The depravity is just unspeakable. And Hillary Clinton hasn't said a word.O'REILLY: Okay. Now, if you go after Planned Parenthood, try to shut them down or defund them then you are declaring a war on women according to the liberal precincts. How would you answer that?FIORINA: Well, you know, if that's really what they believe, then --O'REILLY: Look, they believe it, because how else could you operate that way -- look, unfettered abortion up to the moment that the baby.FIORINA: Yes. It's not a life until it leaves the hospital, that's their policy.O'REILLY: Right. Right.FIORINA: So, if they are not prepared to defund Planned Parenthood I don't know how you justify taxpayer funding for this kind of activity anymore. But I would ask the question of Hillary Clinton more fine and why don't you support an equal amount of federal funding for pregnancy centers for example so that -- right next to a Planned Parenthood. So, that a woman actually has some information about the options in front of her.O'REILLY: Yes. Adoption and things like that.FIORINA: Exactly. But they don't do that either.O'REILLY: No, because it's all politics and now the politics is going into body parts selling.FIORINA: Well, its identity politics which is even worse.O'REILLY: Do you believe that American women in general are not treated the same way men are in the workplace?FIORINA: Well, I think there is some evidence of that. But I don't believe look, if you create a meritocracy, a real meritocracy where you pay for performance, pay for merit instead of say, time and grade and how long have you been there or what you look like. Then you are going to have an equal pay environment and of course, Democrats don't like that. They like seniority systems. That's what unions do. It's what federal government bureaucracies do. If you will give a woman the opportunity to contribute, then you'll have an environment that not only works better but that provides equality of women not all environmental because of that.O'REILLY: But sometimes because of biology, women take time off from work to raise children.FIORINA: Absolutely.O'REILLY: Their priorities are different.FIORINA: That's right. And that's why a seniority system disadvantages women.O'REILLY: Okay. But my point is this. I think that in this country, particularly in the media, women have just as much chance to succeed as men here in where -- in my business.FIORINA: In your world.O'REILLY: I don't see it and I guess it's the same in Wal-Mart, if you are good, the Wal-Mart people it doesn't care whether you are a man or a woman unless there is some idiot in charge. But overall in our society, I think women in America do have equal opportunity. Am I wrong?FIORINA: There is no question that women in America have more opportunity than anywhere else in the world. There is no question. I mean, I started out as a secretary. And I had the chance to become the chief executive officer of the largest technology company in the world and now I'm running for president. That's only possible in this country. It's also true that women are half the nation. And so women are half the potential of this nation. And if you look at the burdens of poverty, for example, it falls most heavily on women, if you look at the fact that women sometimes do leave the workforce for a time, when you have seniority systems that pay for time and grave, that disadvantages women.O'REILLY: No, it does. But remember the poverty on women is driven by having children out of wedlock with no father and no provider there. Now, I have got to ask you about Kate's law. We didn't have you in the mosaic because I knew I was going to talk to you and you could tell the folks, you know, straight on, do you support Kate's law?FIORINA: I do. Here's what I worry about though, Bill. We have seen this for how long, sanctuary cities have been around for 15 years.O'REILLY: You have got to get rid of them.FIORINA: The border has been insecure for 25 years. Politicians are great at giving speeches and they are great at passing laws. What they are not great at is challenging the status quo so something actually gets fixed.O'REILLY: Ms. Fiorina, I have been doing this for 20 years. You have got to stair step it to get anything done. You can't do the whole package at once.FIORINA: Oh, I agree with you.O'REILLY: First you stop the violent felons from coming in here. Then you punish the sanctuary cities. Then a new president is going to have to secure the border. Because this president will not. He absolutely will not do it, no matter what Congress says.FIORINA: I'm not disagreeing with you at all. My problem is this, I think people are frustrated because professional politicians talk about reforming the V.A., securing the border. Passing laws.O'REILLY: And they don't do anything.FIORINA: And they don't do anything.O'REILLY: Right. That's how Trump has ignited his campaign.FIORINA: And that's why people listen when I go out and campaign, and I say I have a track record of leadership and producing results.O'REILLY: Right. I feel sorry for you the only lady and all these other guys are going to be sweating in those debates but we appreciate it.FIORINA: You know, I have been competing against men all my life.O'REILLY: And you do --FIORINA: And I look forward to debating Hillary Clinton. Wouldn't that be fun to watch?O'REILLY: That would be a blast.FIORINA: Wouldn't that be fun to watch?O'REILLY: And we appreciate you coming in. Good luck on the campaign.FIORINA: Thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

8	8	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/12/18/bill-oreilly-donald-trump-secret-strategy/	Bill O'Reilly: Donald Trump's secret strategy	"As you may know I have known Mr. Trump for about 25 years. And I can tell you he is a unique individual. Nobody like him.When he first started running for president, Trump was about 4 percent in the polls. And he had virtually no chance to win if he conducted himself as a standard politician.But Donald Trump saw the campaign as a mission. He sincerely believes most politicians are phonies who are not looking out for us. He also thinks the federal government is screwed up beyond belief and only an outsider can correct things quickly.As far as politics is concerned, Mr. Trump is the ultimate outsider so his campaign theme, in my humble opinion, is that the end justifies the means. Trump wants to win and he knows he cannot win by playing the standard political game. So his strategy is to get attention 24/7, starving the other candidates out.With the media paying so much attention to Trump, you don't know all that much about John Kasich or Rand Paul or Carly Fiorina. You see them at the debates and that's pretty much it.The simple truth is, Trump is playing the electronic media and the media loves it because he delivers high ratings. At this point it's not important to the Trump campaign to discuss things like the nuclear triad or macroeconomics or how to conduct foreign diplomacy. It's enough for Trump to say he is a good dealmaker, he will make Putin his friend and he will kick some serious butt overseas.Of course, some intellectual Americans despise that approach and some pundits here at Fox News are among those folks. For some reason, that rankles Donald Trump. And as I told him last night I don't know why. Trump's strategy is clearly working. Many of his supporters simply want an avenger, someone to blow up what they consider a corrupt system. Policy be damned at least at this point.Now, let me give you a vivid example of how bad Washington is. On July 1st, 32-year-old Kate Steinle was killed by criminal illegal alien in San Francisco. The man had seven felony convictions in the U.S.A., had been deported five times and returned five times.That is a disgrace. If the U.S. Government cannot keep a thug like that out of this country, none of us have any security at all. Now, I felt terrible for the Steinle family and I made a promise to them that I would spearhead new legislation called Kate's Law that would mandate a five-year federal prison term for any convicted aggravated felon who defies deportation. Such a law would give authorities a clear shot at gang members and repeat foreign offenders. It is a law very much needed in America.But, as it stands now, congress will not pass Kate's Law. The despicable Harry Reid blocked it on the senate floor because the Republican senate leader Mitch McConnell attached Kate's Law to an anti-sanctuary city bill. That gave the Democrats cover to vote against Kate's Law and McConnell knew it.Now, I have tried on numerous occasions to talk with Senator McConnell but he refuses to take my calls. And although there are good senators like Cruz, Grassley, and McCain who very much want a stand alone vote on Kate's Law, it is not assured. Although Mitch McConnell could make it happen.Now I ask you, if congress cannot pass a simple piece of legislation that would protect every single American, what can congress do? Donald Trump knows the system is corrupt. He understands the anger of the American people. He calculates that he can run on emotion and possibly win. And that is Donald Trump's secret strategy.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.
