This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight for the very first time, you're about to hear exclusive new insight into a devastating terror attack from the American heroes who lived to tell about it. It comes as a blockbuster movie about their story is released that could change everything you thought you knew about Benghazi. And directly impact the 2016 race for the White House.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. This past weekend paramount pictures released ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" It tells the minute by minute account of the men who risked everything to save their fellow Americans from terrorists. Eleven years to the day after 9/11. And it happened in the shadow of the 2012 presidential election. When it was all over, four Americans had lost their lives. But if not for the men who say they defied direct orders to stand down and not help, even more could have died. Here is an exclusive clip new from the just released film.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How many?(Gunfire)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello, hello!(INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's going to be a peaceful night.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need more information than that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We got you. How many?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Twenty to 40 attackers, separated in several positions.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Listen up. None of you have to go. We are the only hope they have. Two vehicles ready, let's go, move, move.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Tonight, you will hear directly from three of the real-life American heroes who say this story is not about politics, it's about the truth of what really happened on the ground in Benghazi, Libya. It's about a band of brothers willing to die so that their fellow Americans might live. Our exclusive sit-down with them is moments away.But we begin tonight with Trace Gallagher reporting from Los Angeles on what those seeing the film now are saying about this extraordinary picture.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, the film is based on the bestselling book ""13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi,"" co-written by security contractors, who on 9/11, 2012, were in Benghazi at the CIA station called The Annex. After John Krasinski plays Jack, a member of the six men global response team in-charge of defending The Annex, his real identity is still a mystery. In the controversial book and movie, the team says they were told to stand down three different times on the night of the attack. An order that they blame for the death of all four Americans killed that night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't do that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Call it the power of the motion picture, but experts say in the next few weeks the public will learn more about Benghazi from this movie than they have in the past three plus years of Congressional hearings. And news reporting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Anything from the movie surprise you, did you learn any new details that all watching this?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I had no idea that so much took place at The Annex, and what they had to fend off there was just incredible.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It didn't look like where they were was very safe, and you know, they should have had more support.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My stomach is still churning when you actually see it. I mean, to see what our men and women go through it.GALLAGHER: As you watched the movie, did you think there could be political ramifications, that this could affect Hillary Clinton?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely, because she was the secretary of state. Right? She should have been on the phone. There should have been some communication with them.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think there's a lot of answering to be done.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This coming back after it has been pretty much swept under the rug. It's going to have a major impact on the election and on her future as a politician.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It certainly would impact my vote going forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: It's key to point out the team's station chief tells ""The Washington Post"" the stand down order is fiction and the film is flat-out wrong. The CIA goes further calling the movie, quote, ""shameful"" and a ""distortion of the events and people who served in Benghazi that night"" -- Megyn.KELLY: Before we get to our exclusive interview, we want to give you a little more background on the men you're about to meet on what motivated them and then why they decided to tell their story. Take a look at this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KRIS PARONTO, AS TANTO: My name is Christian Paronto, and my call sign is Tonto. And I was with the Second Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. I was in Bravo Company.JOHN TIEGEN, AS TIG: My name is John Tiegen I'm john, a former marine. Did four years with the Third Battalion, 7th Marines.MARK GEIST, AS OZ: My name is Mark Geist, my call sign is Oz. I was in the Marine Corps for 12 years. I was in Benghazi for about 30 days.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody, this is Jack Silva.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's our third contract together so we know it's a drill.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We had DB, former marine, Jack, he was a SEAL, Roan, he was a SEAL. So, it was a good crew. ""13 Hours"" just tells the minute by minute story of what happened that night, try to get what we all did and what we all went through.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We had a team decided the story that wasn't being told out there was what actually happened that night. And so we felt compelled to make sure the story gets out there the right way. It's not about the politics. It's the story of what happened on the ground.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: GRS stands for Global Response Services.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are maybe used in high threat areas.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are the security element for the Central Intelligence Agency, and we just pro-feed protection in austere environments.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stay. We're coming in.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is Chris inside? Is he still inside?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get down!(Explosion)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All of us were former military. Special-ops guys from the Marines, you're working with some of the top guys in their respective services.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ""13 Hours"" was how long we were in the fight that night.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The state guys, we just heard them on the radio say hey, if you guys don't get over here we're all going to die. And we just kind of let that -- we've got to go now.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: None of you have to go.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But we are the only hope they have.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Americans help Americans overseas, especially in areas where there wasn't any military support.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We had to go, no matter what. Damn the consequences.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here we go.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our director is Michael Bay. He's been very respectful to us, and he's taking it seriously and he's got us involved.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Michael had that vision of what he wants and he's doing it in a way so it's as accurate as possible.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My teammates did so many amazing things, and it's the story of the battle, the story of a lot of sacrifice that went on. It showed that there's still guys out there that are willing to sacrifice their lives for others, you know, to put others before themselves.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Very good. Got it. Beautiful.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, three of the heroes who saved dozens of Americans that night. Mark Geist, known as Oz. Chris Paronto who goes by Tonto, and John Tiegen, also known as Tig. Thank you all so much for being here.Tonto, let me start with you.PARONTO: Sure.KELLY: How true to life is the film?PARONTO: Example when I walked out of the theater, I felt just drained. Like there was a big hole inside me. And it was because I really virtually went back to Benghazi when I was watching it. And I missed, missed it so much that it was a part of me that I relived on the screen and I realized how much I've been missing it over the last two years.KELLY: Missed it.PARONTO: I do. I missed --KELLY: What do you mean? The film depicts absolute hell.PARONTO: It's not. It's amazing being with your brothers and fighting with them. Being there and being with them and having the faith that you're going to defeat all the obstacles. It's just -- I relive it. I usually don't get like this. So, no, it just brought home a lot of the truths that we went through. And a lot of the -- a lot of the -- like I said the brotherhood is the best way I can explain it. So, yes, I miss it immensely. I sacrificed a lot to get to this point. And one, it's a job that I really, really love. Yes, I would go back there in a heartbeat.KELLY: The movie and the book takes the viewer and reader through the story of Benghazi. So, our viewers are up to speed. It starts off at the diplomatic outpost, the so-called consulate where the Ambassador Chris Stevens was, and the attack on that compound that was not caused by a video. Where RPGs and mortars and so on are set off and Ambassador Stevens dies due to smoke inhalation along with Sean Smith. These guys in the meantime are off at the CIA annex, another post, it's a mile, less than a mile away, chomping a bit saying, send us, send us. You can hear the distress calls. You can hear the radio calls of the State Department personnel saying, we're going to die, we're going to die, we're going to die. The CIA station chief where you were at the time told you repeatedly, according to the movie, stand down. We saw that in the trailer. Used the words ""stand down."" Is that how you remember it?JOHN TIEGEN, AS TIG: Yes. I mean, there was the chief of the base, chief, and our team leader sitting on the front porch and told me to stand down.KELLY: Ultimately the movie depicts you guys saying, we're going. And Tyrone Woods specifically saying, and that quoted in the movie, saying to all of you, we -- it's up to you. But we're the only hope they have.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Losing initiative.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stand down!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you do not get here soon, we are all going to die.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: None of you have to go. But we are the only help they have.KELLY: Did that really happen?PARONTO: That did happen. And the radio call from Alec Henderson coming across saying, hey, if you guys don't get here, we're all going to bleeping die, that's word for word, that's what actually spurned us after -- and I know there's been conflicts about being the calls at 9:42. I still remember on my watch it being 9:32 when we were first called. But after 30 minutes of waiting and Scott comes -- I mean, Alec comes across, he says if you don't get here, we're all going to f-ing die. We bucked orders and we left.KELLY: You all have testified to this and the trailer that we just watched captures it, too, with the writing on the screen. There was no support. If there's one theme that emerges, that is it, that they were left alone. There was no one to back you up. Throughout the film, you see heroes assuming, understanding based on their experience that the American military will be there to back them up and support them. And help never came. I mean --TIEGEN: I mean, for us, for the military to come and support us, the agencies, we wouldn't have expected it. But the fact that they had a U.S. ambassador that had been missing for about five hours before they actually officially -- he was considered dead and they didn't send anything or attempt to push anything that way is pretty crazy. I mean, I would never expect them just to leave the ambassador out there.KELLY: What did you expect would come? What did you think would show up? Who or what?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Up next, the answer to that question, and whether or not the men believe that those who died would be alive today if they had gotten the support they need. We'll be back with that and more of the story behind those ""13 Hours"" in just moments.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Move over for inspection.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sorry, sir, can't do that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's up?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You see the drone?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because the drone sees you. It sees your face. We know who you are. Anything happens to us, your home, your family, gone. Give the order to let us go.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you ready to die for your country?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm ready to go right here, right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are we expecting any friendlies?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let them come. Let them come.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Report.ERWIN STOFF, FILM PRODUCER: Really very similar qualities as Mark. He has tremendous strength and is just a real guy's guy.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lock this base down. You, you, let's go. Come on.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mark's been such a tremendous asset to me as an actor and given me so much information. Specifics in terms of what happened on the night of the attack, but also just emotionally what he was going through.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I start coming back after shooting. Your adrenaline is running, you don't feel the pain, because you're just worried about making sure that you take care of the business that you've got to take care of.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to unleash hay on these guys.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's an emotional connection that you get having looked in the guy's eyes and heard the accounts directly from them.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stay, we're coming in. Is he still inside?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And so you take on the huge responsibility to make sure that the story is done right.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm on the roof. Don't leave me.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have 36 American lives to save.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was a primetime exclusive clip from behind the scenes of the movie ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" But as these three heroes discussed why they risked life and limb to save their fellow Americans in Libya, they also discussed the assistance they expected from their government that never came. And why they think four Americans paid the ultimate price.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: What did you expect would come? What did you think would show up? Who or what?PARONTO: PARONTO: The biggest thing I think we really need was mainly air support. I mean, kind of --GEIST: Just something to fly over.KELLY: How hard would that have been?TIEGEN: Not hard. Again people see the movie and read the book, know that it wouldn't have been difficult.KELLY: And all we sent was an unmanned drone. So, we had eyes on the situation and our president had been briefed on it at least six hours prior to the annex coming under severe attack and all we sent was an unmanned drone.PARONTO: And it wasn't helpful at all. It was -- the feet that was given to us was --TIEGEN: It made good movie footage.PARONTO: Yes. About 30 seconds behind what we're actually seeing on the ground.KELLY: When you see, I mean, you know, for us it's a new story and thanks to Paramount Pictures it's been made into a dramatic, compelling, white knuckled experience. And I tell the viewers out there right now, don't plan on getting popcorn, don't plan on needing to use the restroom, because you will not leave your seat for two hours. No one spoke a word. No one looked to the left or the right. Your eyes are glued on that screen. So to the audience, that's how it is. But to you guys having lost Tyrone and Glenn, when you look back and you think about Benghazi, what does it mean? Why did they die, Oz?GEIST: They died serving their country, I mean, doing what we love to do. I mean, that's serving other people. That's kind of our whole makeup. I mean, you know, it's just like why would you go, you know, why do we run to gunfire? It's because that's who we are. That's how we were made from the get-go. You know, there's a lot of great guys out there that are still doing this, both what we were doing in the military, and that's just the way the makeup is. You know, that's the core of what Ty was and Glenn were.KELLY: But I want to go back, because one of the things that gets lost I think in the coverage of Benghazi too is the loss of our ambassador who was portrayed in the film as a good man, who was just trying to do the right thing, who had begged for security increases there, and was denied, was denied those security increases. And they had in fact been diminished repeatedly leading up to September 11th. And that's another thing that the investigators have found, which was, he had no business being in Benghazi on 9/11. The administration should not have allowed it, and if they're going to send him, they should have sent him with proper security. But he was skilled that night, and you went -- you went to the consulate the very facility which he was killed. You kept running in to try to get him, right?TIEGEN: Multiple times.KELLY: And the smoke was too much. Describe that moment when you knew he was in there, you didn't yet know whether he was dead.TIEGEN: Umm, you know, it could have really -- I mean, I was on my belly the last time I went in before we got counterassaulted on the consulate and the smoke was still down there, and you still -- could only see about maybe two feet in front of your face. And, you know, it was just so thick and so hot, it was just like being in a brick oven. I mean, you're just sweating constantly and it was extreme heat, and just coughing, because you just can't really hold your breath because one of your adrenaline is pumping and you know, you've been running around for the last hour, you know, fighting your way on and searching and so I mean, it was pretty intense.KELLY: You believe that if you had been allowed to go when you first said send us and the radio calls came in from the consulate saying help us, help us, help us, do you believe there would have been any chance to save them?GEIST: Oh, yes, they would be alive today, 100 percent.KELLY: The Congressional investigators concluded there was no stand down order.PARONTO: I don't know where they got that.TIEGEN: Well, it's because I couldn't read his lips from the drone.PARONTO: Yes. That's just silly. I mean, there was, for us --KELLY: I mean, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and others rely on those conclusions saying, you know, they've really been cleared because investigators concluded there was no stand down order.TIEGEN: It's kind of funny, everything that we testified to, you know, they agreed with us 100 percent, I mean, pretty much from eating a candy bar to, you know, shooting all our ammo, but for some reason they don't want to believe us that we were told to stand down.KELLY: Do you have a political motive?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Up next, the answer to that question. Plus, you will hear from the families of those who died in Benghazi and we'll bring you more of our exclusive behind the scenes clips of this powerful film.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STOFF: The GRS stands for Global Response Staff. These are individuals that all have special services backgrounds.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Base under attack. Let's go, man. Base under attack.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, this was an extraordinary GRS team.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: None of you have to go.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are the only hope they have.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have ex-Navy SEALs, marines and you've got army ranger, and Tonto.PARONTO: My name was Christian Paronto. And my call sign was Tonto.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tonto was one of a kind. He was ready for anything. You know, he signs his e-mails RLTW, Rangers Lead The Way and that's how Tonto lives his life.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY WRIGHT, FOX NEWS REPORTER: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Kelly Wright. Here's what's happening. Iraqi security forces searching a Baghdad neighborhood where three Americans were kidnapped over the weekend. The troops closing streets and conducting house-to-house searches. The Americans were kidnapped from the home of their interpreter. It's not clear what they were doing in Iraq.The U.S. slapping new economic sanctions on Iran over recent missile tests. Officials say the tests violated a United Nations resolution. This is a setback after other sanctions were lifted last year following a land mark nuclear deal.And Eagles get -- and co-founder Glenn Frey has died. The band says, he was suffering from multiple ailments. The Eagles was formed in the early 1970s and became known for hits like ""Hotel California"" and ""Take it Easy."" That's the news this hour.I'm Kelly Wright, now back to THE KELLY FILE.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're coming in.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On the roof.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're under heavy fire.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief. Are we expecting any friendlies?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am not aware of any friendlies.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let them come. Let them come.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I haven't thought about my family once tonight. Thinking about them now. Up here in the middle of all this. I'm thinking about my girls, man. Every time I go home to Becky and those girls, I think, this is it. I'm going to stay.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shoot that son of a bitch.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Unless somethings and I end up back here.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Well, they may be the most controversial questions to come out of the Benghazi attacks. Could American lives have been saved there? And why did the White House initially blame a video when it knew that this was a terrorist attack? Those questions prompted multiple Congressional investigations. Investigations that contradict some of what these heroes have said.But these men not only maintain they could have said. But these men not maintain they could have saved lives that night, but add that the politics that others resorted to on this issue when they got home is exactly what prompted them to go public.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Do you have a political motive?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The one that should have got the star was sitting right there because he saved...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He saved.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... Tyrone's life by going in the building and finding in the way when he was lost. And then he is the first one that come up on the roof and put two tourniquets on Dave Rubin and got a tourniquet on my arm, and probably saved both of our lives.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And had to see him naked once. That's the honor right there.KELLY: That's they joke. That when the audience sees this film and sees what you all went through and you ask what happened to your arm, which was basically hanging off and it was...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And come back right here down.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was pretty impressive seeing him trying to get it -- I remember watching and seeing him trying to get his gun up and his arm is hanging and he's still trying to shoot. I was -- I don't say get it much because I don't want to give any marine anymore kudos than they get, but I'll be honest, I was pretty impressed seeing that after the bombs -- after the mortars hit and seeing him still thinking about...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: And when he went down to get help, it wasn't for himself. It was for the gentleman you just referenced who had also been hit. And So, Oz walks in down below to where the CIA agents are to say there's another guy, his arm is dangling. And he says, there's somebody who is hurt and needs help. And you refused to go on to the air, under that airplane that ultimately got you guys out of there on a gurney.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.KELLY: Why, tell them what you said and why you said it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just walked into that country; I'm going to walk out. I mean, it's just, again, it's who I am. I'm not going to -- I mean, I don't know, it's just, I just felt compelled to. I'm not going to let that -- I'm not going to lose.KELLY: You're covered in blood. Your arm would later require 13 surgeries just to save it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.KELLY: And the looks on the flight attendant's faces, I mean, in the movie, they're shocked.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was actually -- I mean, I look back at it, it was kind of comical. Because as I'm walking up, there was -- the flight attendant's eyes were as big, I mean, as saucers, her eyes were. You know, I'm pretty much buck naked, blood dripping, and she just disappears into the back of the airport -- or the aircraft and I thought she was, you know, going back to get something to help us.But when she comes back up, she's laying towels down because she's afraid I'm going to bleed on her boss' airplane.KELLY: You come back, the video, it was all about a video. And we heard the family say that's how we kicked off the segment that Hillary Clinton, according to the family members, looked at them, at Dover Air Force Base when the bodies came back in the casket and said we're going to get the guys who made that video.And now when asked who's lying, you or the families, she says, well, it's not me. Of course, she's talking about Glenn family. She's talking about Tyrone's family, she's talking about Shawn's family.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, I know Pat Smith, I know Katie Quigley, Gwen's sister. I know, you know, we know Ty's mom. We know what they told us was said. And I do know them very well. Katie was very -- Katie has been on news quite a bit telling you what she was told. And I know that they were told it was a video because that's what they told me. And I believe Pat, I believe Katie, I believe Charles would.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it's easy. I mean, who would have a reason to lie, why? Their blood want just that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It that simple.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly. They have no reason to tell anything but the truth.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: The new fight over the truth of what happened that night is next, along with more of our exclusive reporting on the story behind the scenes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I hate to be a wet blanket, girls, but five dudes with M-4s is not enough. Perimeter saw from this whole compound of sniper's paradise.PABLO SCHREIBER, ACTOR: We had a lot of conversations about what his service was like and then what the, you know, the experiences of that night. And the effect they had on him and the effect that they still have on him today.Who's in the admission of chief? Come on.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you do not get here soon, we're all going to die.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's an awesome opportunity to actually have the real guys here. Just talking to Tig, it was cool because he was saying stuff that you only hear and learn about by actually being there.JOHN KRASINSKI, ACTOR: Dominick comes to play Tig. Dom was very committed to getting to know everything he could about Tig and they really had a fantastic bond.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's little things I've tried to do to capture Tig, sort of some of the physicality that I've picked on learning how to move, learning how to do close quarters combat. Hopefully I'm catching the essence of him.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dominic he has the same attitude as me. And, you know, he asking, you know, a little bit about how I felt, you know, when stuff was going on during that night.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's been invaluable having to hear what he went through and how he performed under pressure like that. I can't imagine.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Over here, these people are moving to try to get as close to the wall, just like something out of the apocalypse.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, are we expecting any friendlies.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not aware of any friendlies.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We really owe it to these guys to get it right and to tell it in a way that shows just how extraordinary they were and what they did that night.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: The 13 Hours that unfolded in Libya more than three years ago, has produced thousands of questions. A number of which are part of the ongoing investigation by the Benghazi Select Committee in Washington.But leading democrats and a lot if there is media supporters like to say the questions have all been answered and this story is over.In fact, after we ransom of tonight's exclusive interview two weeks ago, Erik Wemple of The Washington Post attacked the Kelly File and Fox News suggesting we were trying to promote the account of these men on the grounds that it matched our own reporting.Unlike Fox News, few media outlets are doing any reporting on the glaring dispute between some of the families of the dead and Secretary Hillary Clinton.They say from the moment she first met them, next to the flag-draped coffins of their loved ones, she blamed this attack on a protest and a video, knowing that the video had nothing to do with this. She has now suggested that they are lying, not one of those relatives has wavered in their story, however.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATE QUIGLEY, SISTER OF BENGHAZI VICTIM GLEN DOHERTY: It shows me a lot about her character, that she would choose in that moment to basically perpetuate what she knew was untrue.PATRICIA SMITH, MOTHER OF BENGHAZI VICTIM SEAN SMITH: Hillary's a liar! I know what she told me.CHARLES WOODS, FATHER OF BENGHAZI VICTIM TYRONE WOODS: I wrote down, I gave Hillary a hug and shook her head, and she said, ""We are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of your son.""(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Ed Henry reports now from Washington. Ed?ED HENRY, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, out here on the campaign trail in states like New Hampshire, this cuts right to the heart of why Hillary Clinton is struggling on the question of whether she's honest. Within days of the Benghazi attacks, she and President Obama went to Andrews Air Force Base to speak with the families of the four victims who were killed in Benghazi.Some on the family members as you noted, have said that Clinton directly told them that the attacks were inspired by a video. And in fact, Charles Woods, whose son Ty, of course was killed in Benghazi, said he wrote down in his notebook verbatim as Clinton spoke.And that she said in part, ""We are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of your son."" First of all, that's different from what Clinton told her daughter Chelsea, and some diplomats about what was behind these attacks and whether or not these were terror attacks and it became a flashpoint at that Benghazi hearing back in October. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Within 24 hours, you had a conversation with the Egyptian Prime Minister. You told him this. ""We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest.""HILLARY CLINTON, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, Congressman, there was a lot of conflicting information that we were trying to make sense of.(END VIDEO CLIP)HENRY: Now the plot thickens. Recently, on two occasions, Hillary Clinton has suggested that the family members are simply not remembering exactly what happened at Andrews Air Force Base. The first time was when she did an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: Did you tell them it was a film and when she response?CLINTON: No. I said very clearly. There had been a terrorist group that had taken responsibility on Facebook. This was a fast-moving series of events in the fugue of war.(END VIDEO CLIP)HENRY: Then Clinton did an editorial meeting with a rural newspaper here in New Hampshire. She was pressed on what happened. She said maybe some family members have simply forgotten or mixed it up because of the raw emotions. Then she was pressed by a columnist for the newspaper who said, somebody is lying here, who is it? Clinton said ""not me."" Megyn?KELLY: Joining us now, Fox News Digital Politics editor, Chris Stirewalt and host of Media Buzz right here on FNC, Howie Kurtz. Good to see you both tonight.So, Wemple of The Washington Post seems to have an issue. We did that interview with those three heroes and the feedback we received from the viewers was extraordinary. They wanted to hear more. They wanted to know how they could help these guys. They couldn't wait to see the movie.Wemple has a different reaction, which is what do we learn that was new? I've got news for you, Erik Wemple, you go and you sit through 13 Hours, you sit there, wait knucked when you can't move at the end of it and a tear comes to your eye, unless you're not human. And you tell me whether this is going to have no impact on the story of Benghazi, which is relevant in this 2016 presidential campaign, Chris.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, there is a pepper jelly for him. And look, the power of this movie is not that it is fact- finding. The power of this movie is not that it uncovers something that has not been uncovered before.As you say, it corroborates evidence that was in the book, on which it was based. It corroborates reporting that the team in Fox News did and all of that stuff. The point of this is, the audience for this compared to say, well, I don't know, the audience for a mid-day congressional hearing.Lots of people who are not politically obsessed, lots of people who are not obsessed with foreign policy, who are decent people and have real lives are going to see this movie and now they are to have a predicate for this discussion when it comes in to 2016.KELLY: You know, Howie, the Fox News Channel, has -- I'm very proud of the reporting that we have done on the Benghazi. I mean, I was on the air when Catherine Herridge in the afternoon when she broke the news that there were no protests outside of that consulate, which the administration have been telling us there were.And by the way, they pushed back on her and said she was wrong and she stuck by her reporting and she was right. I was on the air when Fox News said that the White House had meddled in those talking points, which they denied on The Record. And ultimately, we were proven right on that as well.So, Fox News has done some yeoman's work in reporting on Benghazi. But it's not about Fox News, Wemple got it wrong. It's about the story that these guys are telling and to suggest that seeing it on the big screen in a picture like this, directed by Michael Bay, is going to have zero impact and is not worthy of any attention, entirely misses the dynamic at play.HOWIE KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST: Entirely misses the point. Because a dramatic movie like this, based on a book that, by the way, this Washington Post columnist said was very good, has the power to bring to life the account of these men who were there and who are passionate about what went wrong.That's why it will have an impact, not because of some Fox News segments. So, we can debate about whether Fox News has covered it too much. Certainly, you are right. Much of the mainstream media have decided this is old news that it's incremental and people no longer care and that any new developments are incremental. That is one view. But I don't think this issue can possibly go away completely for Hillary Clinton in this 2016 campaign.KELLY: We wouldn't even know -- we would know how -- we wouldn't have seen Hillary Clinton's e-mails to the Egyptian Prime Minister, we wouldn't have seen her e-mails to her daughter which directly contradict the story she told the Benghazi victims if it hadn't been for the pushing that the media has done in this issue, in particular Fox News.But it's not about Fox News, Chris, it's about the families and the media's desperate desire to move on. Take the issue between Hillary and the families. How -- did you see that blown up on the cover of all the magazines and all the newspapers, the fact that Hillary essentially suggested that the family members of the dead are lying and the family members have never wavered.As those three heroes just told me, who has reason to lie? Who? The family members? Why would they make it up? Charles Woods has contemporaneous notes of his encounter with Hillary moments after he had it.STIREWALT: I think the main threats of this hits at the beating heart of this is a concern for Hillary Clinton, which is this. It is unthinkable to most Americans that we would not try, hat we would not try to at least rescue that doomed garrison.So, then you compound it and you say, well, yes, and then the talking points got doctored, so it left a different impression with people in an election year. People say, well, that's seems like you're dishonoring. It's a dishonoring. And then you have Hillary Clinton who says, those poor people they must be mistaken. They must have misremembered.And it is an implicit argument that those people are trying to hurt her politically. And I promise you this, this movie having been out with whomever the republican nominate for president calls Hillary Clinton out on this and stands on the debate stage with add points at her and says, I'm here on behalf of those families and I want to say to you what they told me, which is they're no liars, that's going to be a powerful moment in this election.KURTZ: And here's the thing. The story has been going on, it's a story of some complexity. And so, I think after a while perhaps when people who watched television there has a numbing effect. What this film does and the accounts of these heroic men is that it brings in the human dimension that becomes impossible to ignore and that we can't sometimes always get out in daily journalism.KELLY: It's gripping and it's important, and these guys are important. And are American heroes in the truest sense. Great to see you both.STIREWALT: Thanks, Megyn.KURTZ: You bet.KELLY: At the end of the day, this story is about the men who gave their lives for our country, brave men. We should never forget.Up next, what the heroes of Benghazi have done to honor the fallen.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: The heroes of Benghazi have stressed that the one of the real tragedies here in their view is that the loss of four Americans seems to have been overshadowed by politics.Knowing these men, as we do now, that selflessness is not surprising. But one of these heroes is taking things a step further; making it his mission now to provide for fellow private American contractors once the battle is over. Trace Gallagher has that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We welcome home for the final time Ambassador Chris Stevens, Mr. Sean Smith, Mr. Glen Doherty, and Mr. Tyrone Woods.(END VIDEO CLIP)TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The four men killed in the 2012 Benghazi attacks came from different backgrounds, followed different paths but shared a common trait, a fierce commitment to their country and their mission.U.S. Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens is described by friends and colleagues as a consummate professional known for his determination to learn and live the culture of the Arab world. His dedication endeared him to local residents and endowed him an impressive and essential list of context.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: He was known for walking the streets in the cities where he worked, tasting the local food, meeting as many people as he could.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Intel Officer Sean Smith, the son of a Vietnam vet became a tech expert, well-known in the online gaming universe, the 34-year-old's death devastated his wife and two children and left his mother haunted by the unknown.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: I want to know what happened, why my son is dead, who ordered that, and I don't want it to happen again to other people.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Former Navy SEALS-turned private contractors Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were both known as fearless kids and heroic adults. Woods left behind four children; Doherty left family and friends who will always remember his unending loyalty.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They gave the ultimate sacrifice to the fight. They died with honor and fulfill the in-state that they side. Save those American lives and no one gets left behind.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: No one gets left behind isn't a slogan, it's a promise that ultimately led Mark Geist, who was wounded in the attack, to create shadow warriors, a group designed to support private military contractors upon their return home.That help includes assistance with medical bills, PTSD treatments and other therapies. Shadow warriors ultimate goal, to, quote, ""Inspire hope by offering assistance to these warriors and their families who have walked through fire but continue to move forward."" Megyn.KELLY: We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Lots of viewers are wanting to do something for the Benghazi heroes we spoke to.As Trace reported, Oz started the Shadow Warriors project. It supports wounded American private contractors like these guys with their medical bills and other needs. And they could sure use your support.Thank you for watching, everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It's time to stop holding workers laid off in this recession hostage to Washington politics. It's time to do what is right, not for the next election but for the middle class. REP. MIKE PENCE, R-IND.: The deficit this year is $1 trillion for the second year in a row and more. The American people have had it with run-away federal spending, deficits and debt, and they want to begin to see men and women in Washington, D.C. begin to make the hard choices. (END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: President Obama teeing up a big vote in the Senate tomorrow, another effort to extend jobless benefits. Republicans saying Congress should demand that it be paid for, the $34 billion to extend these benefits. They point to other extensions in the past. For example, back in November, an extension that was described by president Obama this way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: It is fully paid for and so it's fiscally responsible. (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So, what about the politics of jobless benefits? That's where we begin with the panel, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, Mort Kondracke, executive editor of Roll Call, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Bill, what do you think? BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: It's amazing that the president made that appeal, the workers laid off held hostage to the Washington politics. It's time to do the right thing not for the next election, but the middle class. Think about that. He is implying that what's better to do for the next election is not to extend the unemployment benefits. Republicans are playing politics by blocking unemployment benefits. I don't know if that is right or not. I think Republicans are doing it because they believe we have to start paying for things as we give out new benefits. It needs to go beyond insurance that people pay, that's why it's extension of unemployment benefit. I think Republicans think they're doing the right thing and the Democrats think they're doing right thing.But this shows how much American politics change and how much of the reaction against President Obama and Democrats in Congress has led to Obama thinking the good politics, or saying that the good politics is to resist something that -- imagine two or five years ago if you were against unemployment benefit, it was a cruel ad. They cruel Congressman voted to deny the hard-working Americans benefits.Now Obama is saying that the Republicans are playing politics thereby implying that the politics of the welfare state have changed. BAIER: Mort? MORT KONDRACKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ROLL CALL: First, the president is saying that the Republicans are trying to block unemployment benefits. They're making it contingent on pay-fors, budget cuts, and including one step that sponsored by the chairman of -- the Democratic chairman of the Senate finance committee, which would not take effect until 2014. So this is a payout, way in advance, and the Democrats refuse to allow that kind of pay-for, that kind of budget cut to go into effect. The politics of this are each side is playing to the base. The Republican base is people who are deeply concerned about the deficit. The Democratic base is poorer people who the president wants to get out to polls by making the Republicans into scrooge. So each side is playing it. I'm not sure which of them has the right, has the right politics. In a way, each of them is going to benefit politically from what they're doing. BAIER: Charles, the current legislation would finance jobless benefits for up to 99 weeks or five weeks shy of two years. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I'm not sure, I don't have the same analysis as Bill, because I'm not sure I share his premise that the president is sincere when he says it's not about the next election, it's the middle class. I don't think he believes that. I think he believes he is got the politics on his side. He is appealing to the better angels. How can you be against the unemployed? And I think what he is saying is what he always does on every issue -- I stand for the national interest. I stand for the good of the virtuous, and the Republicans are standing for the next election. He says that on everything. So this is a tick of his. I wouldn't credit his sincerity. On the underlying politics of it, I think it's very interesting. I think a year ago, the politics of the debt was considered an issue of the fringe, you know, of the kooks, the Tea Party, which was considered way out there when it started last March and April. By midwinter of this year, there was only one Republican senator who stood up against extension of unemployment, and he was so pressured by other Republicans who were afraid of the issue that he caved in. And now we see the whole Republican Party standing up, on the issue of debt against extending unemployment. That is a remarkable -- KONDRACKE: It's not -- BAIER: So Senator Jim Bunning was setting the way? KONDRACKE: I understand. The way --(CROSSTALK)KRAUTHAMMER: That's how the ads will play. Despite the fact that the Republicans are going to be on TV ads in a reelection, nonetheless, the Republicans think that the debt issue is so strong that it will override that even if it misrepresented as opposition of the unfortunate unemployed. BAIER: Another issue, quickly. Remember, we were talking about the healthcare bill, back then, before it became law, and the concern about the mandate for everyone to buy health insurance, how some called at it tax increase. Here is what the president said back then. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: For to us say that you have to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: Your critics say a tax increase. OBAMA: My critics say everything is a tax increase. My critics say that I'm taking over every sector of the economy. You know that. We can have a legitimate debate about whether or not we'll have an individual mandate or not. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: But you reject it? OBAMA: I absolutely reject that notion. (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, the Department of Justice does not. They are filing in the defense of the mandate of the healthcare law and all these states challenging the healthcare law, this is a 79-page filing of the Department of Justice, in which it cites article 11, section 8, clause one, grants Congress the way to lay and collect taxes, duties, imports and excises, and goes on to cite the constitution and specifically in these documents says this is a tax increase. That is one of the defense arguments. Charles, what about this? KRAUTHAMMER: Of course it is. I was going to mention before the other bait and switches in healthcare reform, when I saw that piece of tape, I have to comment on the president, again, his use of language against his opponent. Notice how he says we can have a legitimate debate about the mandate, but it's completely illegitimate even to talk about it as a tax. Here he is again, hovering above the debate, the man who stands above it all for the national interest and he is saying it's not even legitimate. And now his department is arguing that not only is it legitimate debate, but it's a tax. KONDRACKE: It is a tax. It's a mandatory payout. It's like the payroll tax. It's mandatory. Bud you don't pay it to the government. You pay it to the insurance company. It sounds like a tax to me. KRISTOL: The Justice Department had to file a brief and take it seriously. A year ago, to pick up on Charles' point, people thought the constitutional argument against the mandate, that was old fashioned, fringe-y; who interprets the Constitution literally anymore? Now there are lawsuits from the 20 state attorneys general and a serious chance of serious judges on the federal court will find this part of the healthcare plan unconstitutional. And the Obama administration says wait a second, there is a broad power to tax and it is a tax, even though they knew it would be embarrassing to the president. BAIER: And analysts look at this and say they have written in a way they believe the tax, the Justice Department believes the tax case is the better of the defense in the lawsuit. Tell us who you think is to blame for impasse over jobless benefits? Go to the homepage at FoxNews.com/specialreport. Vote in the online poll. And stick around, we will talk about Joe Biden's foreign policy mastermind. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Separating the parties. This is a cycle of self-sustaining sectarian violence that 20,000, 30,000, 50,000, 100,000 Americans will not be able to stop, a central government that is a democracy that is going to be fair to the rest of the citizens. It is not possible. Mark my words. It is underway and it is going to happen. There will be a central government with control of the foreign policy, with control of the military. (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Vice President Biden this weekend on ABC, saying that he is seeing a central government form but there will be some semi-autonomous governing in the provinces in Iraq. That was among other interesting things in the interview this weekend, we thought we'd analyze it with the panel. Bill, first of all, on Iraq -- what about the dichotomy? KRISTOL: Well, it would be nice, of course, if Vice President Biden one time would acknowledge he was wrong. But it's good for the country he was wrong and good for the country that President Bush resisted the entire Democratic Party in Congress for two years. It's good for the country I think that President Obama is basically continuing President Bush's policy in Iraq, not Senator Biden or Senator Obama's policy. BAIER: Mort? KONDRACKE: You know, it's not absolutely a lead pipe cinch that Iraq can exist as a central government. This is still at issue. The election results haven't worked themselves out yet. And the Kurds are largely independent of the rest of the country. So I'm not sure that in the end Biden version one is not going to be correct. But now we have Biden version two. Some day, I hope it doesn't happen that way, but if the thing falls apart, how Biden will explain that when Bush created the success and the failure would have occurred on Obama's watch. BAIER: He said, Charles, he was not for partitioning Iraq to three segments. He was for a decentralized government with stronger province -- provincial governments. However, however you look at it, it was not -- KRAUTHAMMER: Depends what the partition means. I don't want to beat up on the guy. He is a nice guy, but I will anyway. Why anyone listens to him on foreign affairs, I don't know. The stage of Wilmington was wrong on the freeze in 1980s. He was wrong on the contras. He voted against the Gulf War, remember the good war about Kuwait? He voted in favor of the Iraq war and then said was the worst mistake ever. Then he repented and opposed the surge which redeemed the Iraq War and saved us. So now he tells us he was against partition, when, in fact, he was. I think Iraq is still in play. It's not a slam dunk. It's gone a long way. I'm very disturbed by the deadlock that has happened almost half a year. Al-Sadr showed up in Damascus yesterday, the anti-American cleric, in alliance with Malaki. He showed up with the guy we like, Allawi, who leads a Sunni-Shiite secular coalition. And so there might be a nefarious deal in the works that we don't know. But what is happening in Iraq today is because Obama is to hands-off, and because he's so rigid on his withdrawal -- Syria is a player. Iran is a player, Turkey is a player in the forming of the new government, and we are not a player. And that is not the way it ought to be. It's not in our national interest. BAIER: On Afghanistan, Bill, the vice president said that the policy that is on the ground now is very similar to what he advocated for behind closed doors, but he can't talk about it fully right now. What about that? KRISTOL: It's been reported and never challenged he said privately you can bet there will be a huge drawdown in troops in July of 2011. He was an advocate of adding to the deadline, now a transition moment, to the president's speech, last December. Now, what is very encouraging, too -- we paid a price for that. We paid a price in Afghanistan and Pakistan for the stupid deadline which was added the last minute by the president for totally domestic political reasons. Dove, hawk, idealist, whatever your view, no reasonable person thinks it's intelligent to say we'll get out July 2011 if you are going to send more troops. It was for domestic political reasons and Vice President Biden was for adding it. I hope he repents for that, too. The good thing is he said yesterday on TV, the July 2011 deadline, where we begin to draw down, it could be as few as a couple thousand troops. This was the man who was quoted as saying you can count on us getting out of there after 2011. Now, thank god, I think General Petraeus is in charge of the Afghanistan policy more than Vice President Biden. BAIER: Because Afghanistan officials will tell you privately the Taliban goes in and says August, 2011, we'll be here. KONDRACKE: Absolutely. I think the quicker the administration makes it clear to the parties in the field that the 2011 deadline isn't a real deadline, that we'll be there, that we are dedicated to winning this war, the better off we'll be. If this doubt that's created about whether we're staying, whether we're leaving is getting people's throats slit. KRAUTHAMMER: In Kandahar, they're not watching the Sunday news shows and he doesn't understand all these nuances. The president set a deadline and he has to undo it in public or it will hurt us endlessly in Afghanistan."	['Obama']	['healthcare']

This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 28, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: This is a Fox News alert and some tremendous breaking news today coming out of the FBI e-mail investigation into Hillary Clinton's server. So we are waiting now -- Trump is going to come out in Maine. And here he is right now, looks like he is coming up to the stage. We're going to take his comments and see if he makes any remarks regarding this bombshell news that was released in a statement by Comey today. He did mention it earlier in the day at a prior rally, and here is Trump now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(APPLAUSE)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Thank you. Thank you. Maine. Maine.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: (inaudible) the Trump.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much. That is some enthusiastic crowd. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: One of the most beautiful places on earth. Thank you very much. As you might have heard earlier today, the FBI .(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: . after discovering new e-mails, is reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I have great respect for the FBI for righting this wrong. The American people fully understand her corruption and we hope all -- all -- justice will finally be served.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate and I'm sure that it will be properly handled from this point forward. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Now getting back to things that don't sound quite as exciting, but they're so important, right?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: In 11 days, we're going to win the state of Maine.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And we are going to win back the White House.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: We're going to have --(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. That is Donald Trump addressing his supporters, an enthusiastic and boisterous group there, and to mention that the FBI is reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton and her e-mails. A lot to discuss today on a very busy Friday, so Dana this information came out and really sent shockwaves across the country.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: It was a 10 on a Richter scale and if it was -- if you have a political earthquake. And October surprise that certainly caught the Hillary Clinton campaign by surprise. They were in the air for two hours on their plane and did not have any Wi-Fi service. So you can imagine the people that are down here on earth are -- were sitting there waiting, they can't get to the secretary. They can't tell her what's going on. She gets off -- they land and all of the sudden -- can you imagine being told that the FBI is, just has released this information. The information is vague. It's 11 days before the election and Donald Trump, rightly, is taking this political gift as it is and running with it. The crowds are very excited. The one thing we're going have to talk about through this entire show is trying to fair out certain details that we can about this. So we got a good line up for it, coming up.GUILFOYLE: We certainly do, and a lot of information coming out because right away when this news broke the question was, where did they uncover this information, the devices? What was the source of the secondary investigation that was separate from it? Or all of a sudden, these agents that were investigating came across this information, brought it to the attention of the director, who obviously had to review it, determine it was of significance and then was prompted to have to make a public statement about it. Greg, your face, the grin, yes.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I just -- so happy.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I'm just so happy because once again, Anthony Weiner has made my life great, because if it wasn't for him, we would be talking about polls for the next 11 days instead of -- anyway.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: For Hillary, this is like a week before your wedding and you catch the groom with your sister. But you can't do anything, because you already paid for the catering and the travel accommodations and you are screwed. The only person that's happy right now is Bill Clinton because it's glad -- he is glad it's that Weiner that got Hillary in trouble. But the -- the most important issue here is her judgment. Why -- she's sharing classified information with Huma, who is married to a compromised pervert, one who could be extorted into the service of stealing more information. Hillary is surrounded by deviants. And that's a problem. And that leaves our security exposed. So that's actually the serious piece of this story is that she is compromised by not getting away from these people.GUILFOYLE: And you know, Trump -- Bolling mentioned this before, was tying, you know, the nexus together with Clinton, Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner .ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: In August.GUILFOYLE: . national security and making that case to say this is someone that cannot be trusted because she is surrounded herself by people who can compromise (inaudible).BOLLING: Yeah. Trump did that when Huma Abedin left Anthony Weiner after the third occasion where she found out that he was sexting, and this time it was young -- allegedly sexting young women. And Trump said, ""Good choice.""PERINO: I know.BOLLING: It could -- ""good choice Huma, because look what you are doing, you're putting, you're putting Hillary Clinton at risk, if, if she were to become president and you are putting the country at risk."" So the FBI is panned (ph) -- is forced because they must have found substantial evidence tying the leaks of -- tying the information that could have been classified -- it must have somehow ended up in Anthony Weiner's Blackberry hand. No, I'm being serious.(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)PERINO: I know.BOLLING: They're not reopening --PERINO: Every time we say Anthony Weiner, it's like --BOLLING: No, no. They are not going to reopen the case unless they have substantial and probable cause to do it. I mean, they're just not going to -- even if they found some things or, you know, we found some e-mails and there are some classified stuff on there and that would look bad. This has to be quite a bit of information that they found. I don't think they would be doing this. I will say this is more proof this is the, in fact, craziest, wackiest election in the history of elections. Where do you go? So it has to be unprecedented that you find classified -- alleged classified material or compromising material on a guy who is sexting an underage woman. It's just incredible. And that may be the October surprise and turning point for an election.GUILFOYLE: And also information can be kept and maintained in the cloud and sometimes couples, families share the same cloud storing for pictures, other things. You have access on multiple devices .PERINO: Music.GUILFOYLE: . for cloud whether it's an iPhone or an iPad or home desktop or a laptop, there's multiple sources and streams of forensic that can be pulled to be able to obtain information. The first thing that I'm thinking about Juan is, you know, Huma Abedin could be in trouble, too because of many statements that she's made, whether or not any -- she perjured herself or did Hillary Clinton perjure herself. That's all you're going to tie together, because now you have the interview that she did with the FBI. And if they have uncovered and could, you know, pursuant to this now reopened investigation, information that shows that she made inconsistent statements contrary to perhaps, even e-mails that she sent Huma Abedin back and forth, et cetera. This, you know, very complicated and very serious.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: So, it's a very serious. I mean, I agree. I think it's explosive. And I mean it's like all the Kingsmen. I mean this is a great political novel, crazier than ever. And you just -- the characters abound. I mean not only Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, but now we have Anthony Weiner playing a central role. But what we know and we'll get more from the reporters in a moment, but what we know so far is this is so peculiar because it's not tied in to the previous investigation, per se. There's no allegation apparently that Hillary Clinton or Hillary Clinton's associates were withholding e-mail. There was no e-mail here from Hillary Clinton is what we have learned so far. It's not from her server. Apparently, the device is one that's owned by either Huma Abedin or Anthony Weiner. This is not relate --GUILFOYLE: There are four devices.WILLIAMS: Yeah. But, and it was not related to what we were discussing earlier in the week, which was that there was in the WikiLeaks information that was put out. Apparently, Cheryl Mills who was Clinton's lawyer, was saying, ""Hey, we know about this and we think it's a problem and our people are dealing with this problem and it went back and forth."" That -- this is none of that. So this is like a totally separate thing. I think it gets conflated quite quickly, because there's so much political energy around this. But for republicans, as we saw from the Donald Trump crowd, all of a sudden new hope, maybe this is going to change things. And from the democrats -- I think they're shocked, that's why John Podesta, did he said, ""Put up or shut up.""GUILFOYLE: Juan is missing -- we are missing the headline here. The FBI reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail.WILLIAMS: I don't think that's right.GUILFOYLE: So this about --WILLIAMS: No, no. I don't that's right.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: That's what he said.BOLLING: They never closed it .WILLIAMS: That's correct.BOLLING: . but they are going to reinvestigate.WILLIAMS: They reinvestigate.BOLLING: Yes, for a reason though, Juan. And this is going to -- this -- we talked about this quite extensively while the FBI was originally investigating Hillary Clinton's e-mails. It's the intent issue. Intent -- and they came back and he said, ""Well, you need to show intent."" What the law clearly says, you don't need to show intent if you are negligent by accident, you are still held culpable. Although, now, it may not be Hillary's e-mails, but if she was completely negligent and in classified dangerous material goes from Hillary to Huma to Anthony Weiener, who knows where, there's no intent on Hillary's part, but she will be likely investigated, maybe prosecuted .WILLIAMS: What Comey said .BOLLING: . possibly indicted.WILLIAMS: What Comey said before was there was no .(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: . intentional mishandling of --BOLLING: But it can't really doesn't matter. It really doesn't.GUILFOYLE: It isn't, but --WILLIAMS: But Greg, that issue has been litigated and argued over.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Maybe not.WILLIAMS: But settle.BOLLING: Maybe we will (inaudible).GUILFOYLE: That's not a record --GUTFELD: Hillary's --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Hillary's crime was a cover up. Weiner's crime was he wouldn't cover up.BOLLING: Nice.GUTFELD: But you know --(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: You know what's amazing --GUILFOYLE: Thanks for clearing that up.GUTFELD: You know what's great about this story and why it's so important and so good? It's the FBI. It came from the FBI. It didn't come from WikiLeaks. It didn't come from ""National Enquirer.""WILLIAMS: No.GUTFELD: This came from outsource --GUILFOYLE: Or Russia.GUTFELD: Yeah, it didn't come from an anarchist working with Putin.WILLIAMS: No.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It came from the FBI. And that, that is why this is so important because it's part of the American process. It's, it's not rigged at all.WILLIAMS: Not rigged.GUILFOYLE: OK. And they've also confirmed (ph) as one of the devices to be Anthony Weiner's, one of the devices to be Huma Abedin's. So now we have to determine, in fact, what the other two devices are. But much more on this breaking news day, stay right there. More reaction from the Trump campaign and we're going to check in with our other reporters traveling with the Clinton campaign coming up. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Welcome back to ""The Five."" We continue with the breaking campaign news. The FBI is renewing its investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail server. Our own Ed Henry has been sorting through all the details since the news broke. He joins us now. Can you clarify for us, what did the FBI actually say?ED HENRY, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: First of all, they came out with a letter from James Comey that went up to senior lawmakers on the Hill. By the way, they were stunned and they're not even on Capitol Hill right now because they're on recess, as you know, for the election. That's the significant context here. And he said that in a separate investigation, didn't name which one, we picked up new e-mails that might, underscore might, have classified information. Investigative team came to the director and said, ""We think we need to take a look at this."" And he agreed they needed to do that, first of all. Second of all, I had an FBI source in the 3 o'clock eastern hour, tell me that that separate investigation was the Anthony Weiner sexting investigation that led the FBI to other e-mails on the devices of Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin that led them to say, ""We need to come back and look at this."" Why is that significant? Well, everyone is obviously, rightly focused on Hillary Clinton. This could end up being something where they say, well, Hillary Clinton had nothing really to do with this. It was Huma Abedin who shared it improperly with her husband at the time. And maybe she, you know, lied to the FBI when she did that interview some months back. This is all speculative. This is all possible. We don't know where this is headed. But we also have to be clear that it might not end up, again, for the second time with any charges against Hillary Clinton or her staff or maybe this time there -- this, this will lead to something. But Jake Gibson, one of our outstanding producers just sent us information from a senior law enforcement official who said, look, they know about this pressure from the Clinton camp saying, ""Why are you dropping this on us 11 days from the election?"" But they say, once they found these new e-mails, they were damaged, they do damaged they didn't. If they come out now the democrats say you are trying to influence the election. If they hold this until November 9th and say, OK, let's not influence the election, let's wait. And then they find out there is classified information on November 9th or November 15th, and Hillary Clinton has been elected president. What do you think kind of criticism they'll face then? So the damn if you do, damn if you don't.PERINO: Let's start with our former prosecutor here at the table .GUTFELD: OK.PERINO: . Kimberly Guilfoyle.GUILFOYLE: No, it's not you, Greg.GUTFELD: Oh, that's right.GUILFOYLE: Once again, I'm sorry. Hi, Ed. So yes, well, an incredible story today. And obviously, as a former prosecutor, I find it, you know, fascinating. The fact of the matter they would say they have to reopen an investigation or take a look at this is, that they wouldn't even say that they have to reopen an investigation or take a look at this. I mean --HENRY: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . they couldn't wait. It's too significant, I think. I mean, and what I --HENRY: Sure.GUILFOYLE: What I want to ask you about, too, is in terms of the security briefings. You saw Speaker Ryan say that he wants her to know, get her security clearance, the briefings for that to stop based on the reopening of this investigation. What are you hearing about that?HENRY: Yeah, because at rickshaw (ph), Pompeo was well, who was on the Select Committee on Benghazi is saying the same. Why is Hillary Clinton, as a candidate just as Donald Trump is, why is she still getting classified briefings about ISIS and other sensitive matters if there's still a cloud hanging over her? I sincerely doubt that the Intelligence community is going to yank, you know, the classified briefings or her security clearance right now in the heat of this campaign in the final days. However, that political point can be made by republicans simply because this is the FBI, which is supposed to be non-partisan. I do find it interesting that democrats are now slamming the FBI when back in July when James Comey, who had been hailed as a republican as an independent (inaudible), and our republicans are mad in recent months. But after he said no charges in July, the Clinton camp said, hey, James Comey, he is the FBI director, 10-year term. He is not political. He said there's no there, there. Now all of the sudden, they are all over James Comey.PERINO: All right. Juan Williams?WILLIAMS: So Ed, there was just -- a reaction quickly not from Hillary Clinton, but John Podesta, the campaign chairman.HENRY: Yeah.WILLIAMS: And Podesta said, ""Put up or shut up.""HENRY: Yeah.WILLIAMS: You know, let's see what you've got. And what we have been hearing from you and other reporters talking with FBI sources is that this is not from Hillary Clinton's device. This is from some other device in some other investigation. How many e-mails are involved? And is it possible that the FBI might reach a fast conclusion given the political pressures?HENRY: The honest answer is we don't know how many e-mails at this stage of the investigation, but I think it's an educated guess that it's going to be extremely hard to wrap this up in 11 days. For a number of reasons, one of them is, I spoke to someone close to this investigation who said, look, if in fact there's a problem with any of these e-mails involving Huma Abedin, as I noted before, she was interviewed by the FBI in sort of stage one of this investigation. I'm not to compare notes. What did she tell the FBI under oath? There have been many people over the years who, maybe don't get caught on the classified, mishandling classified information charge, but get caught up on lying to the FBI. Look what happened to General James Cartwright, very recently. And so, I'm not saying she lied to the FBI. What I'm saying, the FBI is gonna have to go back and look very carefully at what she said before, maybe even re-interview Human Abedin, maybe even re- interview and Hillary Clinton. So the idea that there will be a speedy resolution to this seems like a stretch.PERINO: Eric Bolling.BOLLING: Yeah, and that would beg the question, in the event she does end up pulling off a victory anyway, and gets indicted or even worse, gets found guilty of a felony, you would have a felon as a president who would have to step down. I mean, the only -- all these things have to go into people's calculation on who you want to vote for -- let me ask the question. Hillary Clinton, the judgment has to be in question right now. She kept Huma Abedin very close to her. She travels next to her on the airplane, knowing for many, many years that Huma's husband, now ex-husband or separated husband .HENRY: Yeah.BOLLING: . has, had these issues with texting --HENRY: Right.BOLLING: Sexting young women going back years .HENRY: Right.BOLLING: . years.HENRY: Sure.BOLLING: And yet she never pushed --HENRY: Yeah.BOLLING: . maybe that a line, like I need to push you away.HENRY: Right. And let me add another element to this, is you crafted a scenario at the beginning about, you know, what if Hillary Clinton is elected and there's an indictment or there's charges while she's president- elect. Well, think about President Obama. He, then, has the ability -- of course, to pardon Hillary Clinton -- or not. And what has he done during this investigation? One of the reasons why there's a cloud over the FBI investigation, you had former President Bill Clinton get on that airplane with the attorney general -- number one. And number two, President Obama to our own Chris Wallace, said the 60 minutes on a couple of vacation said, ""I don't think there's any there, there. She didn't, she didn't jeopardize national security."" That looked like he was judging this investigation before it was through. So what role will President Obama play? That's a whole another asset -- aspect.PERINO: Possibly none. OK, Gutfeld.GUTFELD: Ah, Ed, always a pleasure to see you.HENRY: Yeah, always a pleasure to talk to you.GUTFELD: Especially under these circumstances.HENRY: Yeah.GUTFELD: Am I right, huh?HENRY: Exactly.GUTFELD: Yeah.HENRY: Yeah, love (inaudible).GUTFELD: What are you going as for Halloween?HENRY: I usually don't dress up.GUTFELD: oh, because you are Ed Henry, you don't have to.BOLLING: Private server.GUTFELD: My question --(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Yes, exactly.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: And later you get debriefed.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Is the FBI in revolt in a sense that they knew there was enough there to get -- to go after Hillary, but they didn't and they knew that if something came out later, they would look bad? So was this --HENRY: Yeah.GUTFELD: . essentially, is Comey realizing this? That this other stuff came out because they were protecting themselves, rightly, so?(CROSSTALK)HENRY: Yeah. Let me, let me tell you what facts we know. And then let me tell you, you know, what we don't know. And what we do know is, yes, the FBI has been near revolt. There are current FBI officials who have been telling us privately that they can't believe that James Comey had that news conference in July, where he basically said that Hillary Clinton mishandled national security information, but said there wasn't enough here to bring charges, and that infuriated people inside the FBI. So, but what we don't know is whether -- did he latch on to this because agents came to him and said, hey, boss, we found some other stuff and he saw a mulligan here? Like, I got a second crack at this, because if that's what's going on here, that's a very risky thing to do so close to an election.PERINO: All right. As we discussed, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on these development -- latest developments. But what's the buzz from her campaign? Jennifer Griffin is on the ground with Hillary in Iowa. We're going to check in with her, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back to ""The Five.""It has been a trifecta of scandals this month for Hillary Clinton; WikiLeaks, Obamacare's implosion and now the biggest of all, they renewed investigation of her e-mail server. It's almost four months since FBI Director James Comey decided not to indict or recommended not to indict Hillary, a decision the democratic nominee cheered.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I greatly appreciate the work that the FBI, Department of Justice did and they handled it very professionally. And I have said many times and I repeat clearly today, it was a mistake for me to use personal e-mail. And i regret that. I am certainly relieved and glad that the investigation has concluded, but I also know how important it is to make sure everybody understands that I would certainly not do that again. That is something that at the time as even Director Comey said seemed like a convenience, but it was the wrong choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: This all comes just 11 days before the election. And while we have yet to hear from Clinton, herself of the subject, the news is sure to hadn't sent shockwaves through her campaign. So what's the buzz behind the scenes? We're going to check in with Jennifer Griffin, who's on the ground with the Clinton campaign. Now Jennifer, let me just ask you this. There was a lot of confidence coming from Hillary Clinton over last couple of weeks. She started talking about down ballot races. She talked about save a date for her victory party in New York, and she also she started ramping up her transition team. Tonight, are we hearing a different speech coming out of the secretary?JENNIFER GRIFFIN, NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Eric, right now, we're hearing nothing out of the secretary. As you mentioned before, the Wi-Fi on her plane was down when this news broke. And so when she arrived in Iowa, in Cedar Rapids, her campaign didn't know about the news that Comey had sent this letter to Capitol Hill, to the republican heads of the committees. What I have since learned from a well-played source is that, is that the, the decision by the FBI director to send this letter to Capitol Hill came because his agents briefed him yesterday that they had new information. It came untold from four devices that were seized a result of the investigation and to Anthony Weiner sexting tape. One of those devices untold belongs to Huma Abedin, his ex-wife or his estranged wife. One belonged to Anthony Wiener, and the other two, it's not clear who they belonged to. They are going through those devices. I'm told by a well- placed source with law-enforcement sources that -- that they have not found any classified information as of yet.But as of yet, other -- Jake Gibson (ph) and other producers from FOX News have spoken to the FBI, suggested this. This may not be wrapped up before the election.We've heard reaction from John Podesta, her campaign chairman, who issued a very full-throated written statement, demanding that Comey release the information he has. And Brian Fallon was just on the air, her spokesman, saying that this was irresponsible, and that the FBI director owes the voter, owes the public an explanation. They're demanding a press conference.What's highly unusual about all of this, Eric, is that the FBI never usually acknowledges investigations. And so this letter to Republicans on Capitol Hill, which has been leaked now to the press. It really is an aberration in many ways, and the campaign is crying foul.BOLLING: All right. Jen, we have four quick questions. We'll try and keep the questions quick and the answers brief, if you don't mind -- Dana.PERINO: I know you're going to be covering this speech that she's going to give. I guess I'm curious from a communications perspective on her end, how can she comment on something when she doesn't even know what the information is. And, if there's an investigation, you usually don't comment on it anyway.GRIFFIN: Well, exactly, Dana, from what -- what we're hearing, these are not necessarily related to her e-mails. They are devices that were seized by -- from Huma Abedin and Anthony Wiener. So it's really unclear what, if anything, Hillary Clinton can say, and as we saw in the last campaign stop, she didn't say anything.BOLLING: K.G.GUILFOYLE: OK, yes. So obviously, this is explosive information coming so close to the election. But as a former prosecutor, I have to tell you, the fact of the matter is, he did come forward with it, and they are now reconsidering the investigation. When Podesta said, you know, ""I demand to get the information,"" the information that he's demanding might not be favorable to his candidate.GRIFFIN: Well, it might not. But they don't know how to respond to it. And so they're saying that it's very unusual for the director of the FBI to put out information about an ongoing investigation and leave voters with 11 days left until the election with such unknowns. So they are actually requesting that the FBI director hold a press conference, as he did after he decided to not bring charges against Secretary Clinton.BOLLING: Juan.GRIFFIN: Kimberly.WILLIAMS: So Jennifer, I just -- your sources are telling you there's no classified information involved. So what would be the basis of this case?GRIFFIN: Well, again, this source is saying nothing has been found as of yet. But it is very hard to understand, because this is -- we're sort of in uncharted territory.And what the campaign is saying is that they would like to know if -- if this has to do with Hillary Clinton's e-mails. And from what they are hearing, it is not about Hillary Clinton's e-mails. It's about information found on the devices seized from Huma Abedin and Anthony Wiener.Huma, of course, is traveling with Secretary Clinton today. She is never farther than within an arm's distance from Hillary Clinton. And so it's really a question of whether, maybe perhaps Huma Abedin lied to the FBI in the past. She was one of the early interviews in this investigation.GUTFELD: I've got an odd question, Jennifer. Could this actually help Hillary in the sense that people who weren't going to vote might vote out of sheer terror that she could lose? Like, this might actually have a rebound affect? Dumb question.GRIFFIN: It's anyone's -- Greg, it's anyone's guess at this point. This is the strangest election I've ever seen.WILLIAMS: Me, too.GRIFFIN: And all -- all I can say is that the campaign had been concerned about the suppression of the vote that people would be complacent, because some polls were showing her so far ahead. And so it is really anyone's guess at this point.BOLLING: All right. We're going to leave it there. Jen, thank you very much. By the way, there's still three days left in October.GUTFELD: Yes, amazing.GUILFOYLE: What else?BOLLING: We're going to go live to Cedar Rapids for the reaction from the Trump campaign. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Welcome back. Today Trump supporters chanted ""lock her up"" after he told them about the news that Hillary's under investigation again. Let's go now to Campaign Carl -- that's Campaign Carl Cameron -- live in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where the GOP nominee will be holding a rally later.So Carl, what is the mood there? I imagine people are really, really sad. Am I right?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, if sad means exultant. And Trump -- Trump would tweet ""sad exclamation point"" or ""exultant exclamation point.""GUTFELD: Yes.CAMEROTA: Now, of course, the Trump campaign thinks that this is a great opportunity. Yet, it dovetails with all of the criticism they've had all along. And you talk about the crowd chanting, ""Lock her up."" Trump fans will chant ""lock her up"" for just about anything. This one is just another reason to do so.GUTFELD: Yes -- Dana.PERINO: Carl, I imagine that this would breathe some new life into some of the close Senate races, like maybe Missouri, Indiana, Pennsylvania, so that Republicans, now they can actually start talking about Hillary Clinton again and not Donald Trump. But it might actually help Republicans win some of those seats.CAMERON: Instead of explaining, they could be criticizing. So that is a major relief for the likes of Kelly Ayotte and Kirk in Illinois and Blunt in Missouri. And whether this is the October surprise or not, it would be pretty ironic if it turned out that it was a Wiener probe that actually pulled that off.GUTFELD: Can you please not use the word ""probe"" when you're talking about Wiener?GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.GUTFELD: Keep those words far apart. We never want to hear that again from you, Carl.Eric.BOLLING: Carl, look, look, if I'm Donald Trump, I stick to the script right now. I don't go off the beaten path on anything. It's going to be this. It's going to be Obamacare. It's going to be -- my question, why Iowa with only 11 days left? I mean, he needs Florida. He needs Ohio. And he needs North Carolina or it's game over. What is it about Iowa? No offense to the people who live in Iowa.CAMERON: No, of course not. Well, first of all, it's a swing state. The race is close. And he's en route to go to Arizona as well as Nevada. Arizona, he has to play defense. Hillary Clinton has really caught up on him there.In Nevada, that's -- that's another Clinton potential swing state where there's been a very, very close race. So he's going to keep on barnstorming right straight through. And there are about nine states or so that he continues to campaign on aggressively. There's really only four that he's advertising in aggressively. Notwithstanding the new infusion of $10 million from Trump of his own money to an ad buy that's already been placed for about 25 million to get him to the sprint.So Trump wants to compete everywhere. And because of his sort of verbal throw weight, he can pretty much go anywhere in the country and know that the television coverage and the attention that his supporters will have around the country will hear it and echo it.So Iowa makes sense in the sense that there are a heck of a lot of states that are close enough that either one of them could end up winning, particularly because of the volatility that the new FBI reinvestigation has caused.GUTFELD: K.G.GUILFOYLE: Hi, Carl. So it seems that he spoke more about it in the earlier rally than he did the one we took at 5 p.m. But so far, any discussion where they're going to be hitting hard to say that she should no longer be privy to those security briefings that she's been receiving, based on this new investigation being opened?CAMERON: Sure. You're talking about the national security briefings that they get fairly regularly. And House Speaker Paul Ryan actually today put out a statement saying that they should stop immediately, because she's proven herself once again unreliable in handling national security classified information. That's not going to stop, however.And again, it's unclear where this goes. There's been some soundings from some of the investigators that, look, this isn't necessarily going to be a game changer. We are -- this is maybe just out of an abundance of caution. Or that Director Comey has been under tremendous pressure. So it was politically and administratively a wise thing to do.But in the end, what happens in the investigation or the renewed investigation as a legal matter has very little to do with what the political matter is. Both candidates stretch the truth. You know, all politicians lie and never trust the media and all that stuff.So how they play or how they fight back and forth, that's what's consequential. What happens in terms of politics. In terms of the investigation, this is unlikely -- investigators have said this. It's going to take a while to sort through all of this. And it's not going to happen in the next 10 or 11 days. And if it did, then they'd probably be accused of rigging the election in October themselves.On the other hand, when it goes after the election, depending on when it comes out, they may be -- they may be accused of having rigged it after the fact.GUTFELD: All right. Last question.CAMERON: Not having really.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: Hey, Carl, let's get back to the money that you were talking about. I'm so interested in that. Because the stories prior to this bombshell that broke were about the fact that Trump had not put in the amount of money that he had promised into his own campaign.And secondly, that the big donors on the Republican side had abandoned Trump and instead were investing money, as Dana was talking about, down ballot, trying to save the Senate. Do you think this could change that dynamic, Carl?CAMERON: Well, Trump has been saying now pretty much since a couple of weeks after the Republican convention and Mike Pence joining the ticket, that he has put -- he said, ""I put in $100 million of my own money."" And that's inaccurate. We know from the latest FEC reports that the total at the -- ten days ago was $56 million.Today, Kellyanne Conway, the campaign manager, said he plans to add another $10 million to that. Now, there's a $25 million ad that's supposed to take him to the end of the year with these ads, basically in the battleground states Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. They may expand it into a couple of other states. That is where the $10 million is intended to go.But that would bring the total to $66 million, not the $100 million that Trump almost every day says that he's already spent. So the money matters. Money always matters, because money translates to ground game. And ground game now is what it's all about.For instance, how many new voters, Democrats and Republicans, have been registered? How many have applied for early voting in both parties? How many absentee ballots by both parties have been selected? We don't know how they voted, but we do know how many absentee ballots have gone out on both parties. We know how many early voters there have been.And Trump is ahead in some states. Hillary is ahead in more states, particularly the battleground states. It's not quite even. If you pick any eight to ten states, it would be three for Trump and seven for Hillary, or four for Trump and six for Hillary. There is a bit of a disparity there. It doesn't determine the outcome of the race, but it suggests that Democrats are coming out a little bit more aggressively than the Republicans.WILLIAMS: Thanks, Carl.GUTFELD: All right, Carl. Well done, as always. See you soon.Continued analysis of the FBI's renewed investigation of Hillary Clinton, up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Continued analysis of today's midday bombshell, the FBI's decision to renew its investigation of Hillary Clinton. Greg, you had some thoughts.GUTFELD: You know, I keep thinking to myself, this really is the decade of Anthony Wiener. Because no man has had more impact on pop culture and politics. He's the pervert mascot of the last six years. He's like -- he's an emblem of a self-indulgent era. He's the online equivalent of herpes.GUILFOYLE: Eww!GUTFELD: He just keeps coming back. If my close friend, Andrew Breitbart, were alive today, he'd probably die.PERINO: Happy.GUTFELD: Happy.WILLIAMS: I don't know what -- Dana, sometimes after Greg speaks, I just...PERINO: I've got a couple things. I've got a couple things. I've got two things. You know who the happiest person in New York City was today?WILLIAMS: Who?PERINO: Doug Band. The writer of the memo on Clinton Inc. And today, Doug was going to face a lot of scrutiny this weekend in terms of alleged corruption and the Clinton Foundation. So he's probably happy.The other thing is there will be an interesting discussion, I think, that we'll have to have over the next few years before the next presidential election. That has to do with early voting. It is estimated that about 40 percent of citizens will have voted before November 8.So if you voted a month ago and now you have breaking news like this that might have swayed your vote...GUILFOYLE: Regrets?PERINO: ... you have already cast your vote.GUTFELD: You get a do over.PERINO: I'm just not for early voting.GUTFELD: A do over. A mulligan.PERINO: I understand the whole idea of the convenience of it. I just -- I think for this reason alone that it's a good reason to...GUILFOYLE: I think you're right.WILLIAMS: Eric Bolling, you and I go back and forth about polls.PERINO: Are we doing that again?WILLIAMS: So Eric Bolling...GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: ... if right now a poll was taken after the news, do you think it would be different than a poll that was taken before the news?GUILFOYLE: And specify about the margin of error.BOLLING: Let's also talk about what was going on right before this. The polls and the momentum was changing. It was drifting back towards Donald Trump's side. I mean, those wide margins were becoming smaller and smaller.You have to think this is going to have some effect. Everything has had an effect in this election. Donald Trump says something, it has an effect. Hillary Clinton coughs, it has an effect. Now we have this.GUILFOYLE: Stumbles.PERINO: Or falls down.BOLLING: Now we have an investigation by the FBI that could, you know -- who knows? Land her an indictment or worse. This is big stuff, Juan.WILLIAMS: So Kimberly, the thought I'm having is that I think most of this is baked in. People who said, ""You know what?"" Hillary Clinton, not trustworthy, is already a high number. And that's both sides.GUILFOYLE: Well, that number could grow. And it also could suppress voter turnout for maybe some of her supporters who are on the fence or independents, people that were still undecided. Like Dana said, it's a concern, because when you have so many people in the electorate voting early without really a full package of information and then now this comes out, you say, ""Wait a second, would you reconsider? Would you have made a different choice?""WILLIAMS: Do you think -- you think, Kimberly, it's the headline, the reopening, or that people will say, as Greg was saying, this is about Anthony Wiener, not Hillary Clinton?BOLLING: You don't know if it's about Wiener.GUILFOYLE: We don't know that. That's sort of wishful thinking on Podesta Inc.PERINO: And possibly overreaching on the other side.BOLLING: But the FBI is not going to reopen an investigation just because there's some -- some information on Anthony Wiener's device or Huma's device. There -- I would think that there has to be some tie to Hillary Clinton. Otherwise, this would just be -- we will continue to look into this.WILLIAMS: We don't know. Let me emphasize to the audience, we don't know.GUTFELD: I know.WILLIAMS: But I will say to you -- You know?GUTFELD: I know, but I'm not telling.WILLIAMS: That's the problem. You know too much. But I will say that what we know so far and what Jennifer Griffin was saying is this is not about Hillary Clinton, per se.BOLLING: We don't know. She doesn't know either. They have no idea. For Comey to come out and say we're going to reopen an investigation based on an investigation we've already got going with Anthony Wiener. It's independent. There has to be a tie. Otherwise, why in the world would they reopen an investigation.GUILFOYLE: He said it was based on one source that told her that, in fact, they hadn't found anything yet that was classified. You've got four devices. It's going to take considerable time. I'm telling you, as someone who evaluates these investigations. You're not going to reopen, reconsider, consider new evidence unless there was something that he eyeballed and saw and knows he...BOLLING: More than one I'm guessing.PERINO: I need to double check this, but I believe I saw something from Mike Pence, saying the FBI should release everything. I don't know if that's a good strategy. And I don't know if that's what Donald Trump thinks. But I do think that there has to be some sort of connection, or Comey would not have said that he would do this. This is a big deal.WILLIAMS: It sure is. All right. Final thoughts coming next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: You're looking at Hillary Clinton live in Des Moines, Iowa. Still no comment yet from her on the renewed investigation into her e- mails.Final thoughts from us now. But this just in from our urgent wire from Ed Henry. An FBI source now says that, while the separate investigation of Anthony Wiener is what opened the door on the new stage of the review, the focus is actually on thousands of e-mails that were sent and received by Huma Abedin, Clinton's top aide.The source could not say whether those e-mails were sent back and forth with Hillary Clinton or not. And this is a big looming question that we don't know the answer to at this point.More importantly, the question, of course, as outlined by James Comey's letter to Congress, is whether the e-mails were classified or not. So that's the latest development that we have, Greg.GUTFELD: My final thought is Hillary Clinton -- the Clintons are like a pen that you leave in your jeans, and you throw in the wash. And then 45 minutes later, all of your frilly whites are hopelessly stained. The moral to the story is, keep the Clintons out of your pants.GUILFOYLE: The headline there was that you have frilly whites. But actually, that's no surprise -- Dana.PERINO: I mentioned in the previous block about Mike Pence's tweet, and I do have it here. It says, ""We call on the FBI to immediately release all e-mails pertinent to their investigation. Americans have the right to know before election day."" Which that is the same thing that John Podesta is saying from the Clinton campaign. So maybe they actually can reach an agreement and turn those all out.I just -- my final thought is that this gets back to the exceedingly reckless decision by Hillary Clinton to set up a private e-mail server. In WikiLeaks, we found out her team believed that that story would go away in a within. And it is actually something that has dogged her from that -- from when we first heard about it during the Benghazi hearing that Trey Gowdy found in that investigation, and now the Democrats are going to have to defend their support for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail for the next ten days.GUILFOYLE: And Trey Gowdy will be on ""The Kelly File"" tonight. Megyn's going to interview him.Bolling, the significance of this?BOLLING: Here's the significance. We will find out throughout the night, Donald Trump will again speak during the 8 p.m. hour. I'm going to be hosting the 8 p.m., ""The O'Reilly Factor."" Kellyanne Conway is going to come on. We will talk to her about it. We've extended the invitation to anyone from the Hillary Clinton camp. Come on, let's defend it. Come on at 8 p.m. We'll be live. We'll be watching that. And Bill O'Reilly will weigh in on what's going on.GUILFOYLE: OK, Juan? Based now also on this information that came in through the urgent wire, specifying involvement potentially with Hillary Clinton of what could be sent overseas.WILLIAMS: I think it's what you heard was Huma Abedin. And so the question is -- you know, I mean, I think that right now a lot of Republicans are celebrating. And they have reason to think, there's new energy in the campaign. But again, I think you might look before you leap here. Because just what you heard from Pence, it's the same from Podesta.GUILFOYLE: All right. And that's it for us.
