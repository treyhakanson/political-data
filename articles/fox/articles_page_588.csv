IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.REP PELOSI: HILLARY CLINTON STRUGGLES WITH WHITE MALES BECAUSE OF 'GUNS, GAYS AND GOD'Ric Grenell: I think it's because of comments like Nancy Pelosi. She is the representative from San Francisco, the place originally where diversity and tolerance was born. It's so sad how far we've fallen. Yesterday's champions of diversity have become today's intolerance.  They look at just race and gender and don't look at the ideological differences.Mercedes Schlapp: I think it shows that Nancy Pelosi as many of the Democrats, they've been so focused this whole week about pushing for this identity politics. They kind of forgot about the white guy in the room. So it's interesting that they have talked about jobs but, guess what? It's all about the same old bag of tricks that we have seen.  Pushing forward a tax plan that would basically reduce our jobs, reduce our wages, and slow down our GDP. It's the same old bag of tricks.  David Mercer: I didn't see much at the Republican convention where they addressed that very concern that you're raising. And I will say this. As an African-American male, I think I would be in more trouble at times had we more of the Bush policies that we saw over his eight years than we do and the recovery of the economy under Obama.  Lisa Boothe: Republicans did address the concerns of African-American voters of Hispanic voters because what Donald Trump talked about was jobs and creating a better economy for all. An all-inclusive economy that's going to help every American get back to work. The only group of voters that has benefited under president Obama is the rich.  TRUMP: WOULD BE NICE TO 'KNOCK OUT' ISIS TOGETHER WITH RUSSIALisa Boothe: We do need a stronger coalition because that's lacking. I'm not sure what the resolve of Russia is in defeating Isis considering the fact they have attacked U.S. Forces in Syria. That's a concern there. But the problem is we have a president that has shown no resolve in fighting Isis. He himself has said he has no plan to defeat Isis.  Ric Grenell: It's really going to take a great negotiator and U.S. Leadership, which we don't have right now. Let me try to be very blunt about this. The U.S. has two equal goals, to get rid of Assad and to crush Isis. We've been very clear Assad should go. We haven't backed off that policy. We haven't done much there. We haven't done much in five years of bombing with 63 coalition members to defeat Isis.  Mercedes Schlapp: Keep your friends close and enemies closer. When you think about Russia, it's a tricky proposition, because the Russians do want to have closer cooperation with the U.S. In defeating ISIS. The U.S. has to be smart in being hesitant in how they move forward with Russian relations because you can't trust the Russians full force here. However, I do believe that Putin does respect strength in a leader.  David Mercer: That might work if Russia had the same goals in mind that we do. At full disclosure; I've worked with turkey for ten years. I can tell you that as was stated before, Turkey's main interest is to get rid of Assad. Russia's main interest is to keep Assad. So we're in the middle of that. Our main focus having retaken Fallujah, having removed 150 leaders off the battlefield on Isis.  I think we need to stick with our allies before we start venturing into Russia territory.REPORT: PRES OBAMA'S TRIP TO PARIS CLIMATE CONFERENCE COST TAX PAYERS NEARLY $4.2MMercedes Schlapp: Let's get this right. For Americans, the climate change topic is in the low, low priority. Economy, national security ranks as the top two issues most important.  Here you have the president on his junket where they travel to conference alone burned 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide and yet they're going forward making this case of, lets push forward this Paris climate agreement. Even climate activist themselves have said, is this agreement a false hope that really does nothing to help improve the climate?Lisa Boothe: This is how woefully out of touch the administration is with the American people, how misplaced their priorities are. This administration has more concern about refrigerators than they were about Isis or declining middle class or the fact that we are facing a $19 trillion debt and growing.  David Mercer: This administration was elected twice to serve the people. Moving to the heart of the topic, I believe it's a seat at the table. If we're not at the conference or not engaged in these forums, we may pay a higher price later in not being present to serve our interests, to make sure we protect our competitive advantages.  So I think it's money well spent.Ric Grenell: I have been involved in many of these. Let me tell you that they are suggestions. They are self-reporting countries. They self-report and self-police. The day after this agreement came into place, India said we have no interest in implementing these carbon rules. So this is not a mandate. It's all suggestions. We could have accomplished more by having the president give a speech and talk about what should be done, present goals. Flying over there is a waste of money.  "

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" September 23, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: Stand and speak and vote your conscience. Vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He will come and endorse over the next little while. He will come and endorse just because he has no choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, he did. Ted Cruz endorsing Donald Trump today, saying he will vote for him and he wants you to vote for him in a Facebook post after saying ""After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day I will vote for the Republican nominee Donald Trump."" He says he made that pledge. He's sticking to it.He finishes saying ""Our country is in crisis. Hillary Clinton is manifestly unfit to be president and her policies would harm millions of Americans. And Donald Trump is the only thing standing in her way. A year ago I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee and I'm honoring that commitment. And if you don't want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him.""Now, on background, officials will tell you that one of the main reasons he did this was because of the move the Trump campaign made to expand the Supreme Court justice possibilities to include Senator Mike Lee and the pledge that Donald Trump would only pick from the list that is expanded, as of today that includes Senator Mike Lee.Now, the Trump response to the endorsement, ""I am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz. We have fought the battle and he is a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.""Let's bring in our panel, Lisa Boothe, columnist with the Washington Examiner; David Catanese, senior politics writer for U.S. News and World Report, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, David, I mean, obviously we could play sound bite after sound bite of these two going at it, especially towards the end. How big a deal is this?DAVID CATANESE, U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT: I think it's a bigger deal for Ted Cruz's future than anything that will happen in this current cycle. Two things change since Ted Cruz defied Donald Trump at his own convention until now, besides the Mike Lee add, which I'm a little cynical about.The two things that I really think move Ted Cruz is that he is in trouble in his home state in Texas in a reelection battle where he is now behind Rick Perry if he were to challenge him in the Texas Senate primary, and tied with a Castro brother. The other thing that's happened is that Donald Trump is in a much better position to win the presidency now.So I think Cruz was always caught between a rock and hard place, and he, for his future, for him to have a future in the Senate or to run for the White House again he had to get on board.BAIER: Lisa, Mike Pence? Vice presidential nominee met with Cruz here in Washington, and apparently that's where this kind of deal started.LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, I think another thing that happened as well was the backlash that Senator Cruz faced, particularly from one of his biggest donors, Robert Mercer. So I also have to imagine that might have helped move him along in this direction as well.Secondly, I think as Donald Trump improves in the polls, he doesn't approve in the polls, especially heading into Election Day, I think you will see a lot more Republicans like Ted Cruz that were holding out potentially come and support Donald Trump.  But this most certainly helps Donald Trump. Not only does it make him look strong in the sense that Senator Ted Cruz, who vehemently opposed him in the speech before the Republican National Convention has now come around, but also helps him in his effort to try to coalesce the Republican base and support which he has been struggling with.BAIER: You know, though, the polls seemed to have changed recently. Our state polls, some national polls now have it at 93, 94, 95 percent of Republicans saying they are certain they are going to vote for Donald Trump. So coalescing the conservative base, obviously a concern, but this helps with that.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: It does help. But I think David is right. This is about Cruz much more than it is about Trump. And when he says it makes him a little cynical, I would have to say that that's an understatement. It should make you very cynical.I love the way Ted Cruz said after searching his conscience. Whenever a politician says he is searching his conscience, you can assume it was a quick search of a very small space. Now, I'm not saying anything personal about Cruz, but, remember, he and Trump were the outsiders. And what was their calling card from the very beginning? We don't act like the Washington insiders. We don't scratch each other's back. We speak our conscience, et cetera.  Well, it turns out in the end that they do what you would expect of any other candidates, which is why -- I mean, I don't denounce them or deplore what they are doing here. This is business as usual. But weren't they the candidates who were against the business as usual?  And I like Trump's line, his line where he says we fought the battle. He was a tough, brilliant opponent. At the time he was a tough and lying opponent. And now, apparently, he is a brilliant opponent. This is politics. This is exactly what you would. But it is not how they sell themselves.BAIER: Yes. As I said we could play sound bite after sound bite from the primaries.I want to turn to this other story, and that is the immunity deal given to five people tied to the Clinton email investigation, including Hillary Clinton's former chief of staff Cheryl Mills. Here is the House Government Oversight Committee chairman.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JASON CHAFFETZ, R-UTAH: This is not a real investigation if you're handing out immunity like candy. The fact that they would let Hillary Clinton's chief of staff to be also a witness and immunity recipient, and sit in on Hillary Clinton's interview, is just shameful. Why is a witness interviewed by the FBI able to sit with Hillary Clinton during her interview? That's just -- Lady Justice is just different for Hillary Clinton than it is for anybody else.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: And just to be clear, the DOJ gives this immunity at the beginning of this, and then, obviously, the FBI does not get to the place where they're going to prosecute.CATANESE: And I think the real problem for people watching at home is that why would you have to give immunity to people if there is nothing to hide here? If everyone could come out and be transparent about the process, critics would say, why did immunity have to be granted?Cheryl Mills is getting a lot of the press on this because she was the chief of staff. But this Bryan Pagliano, who deleted the emails, that's the most fascinating. This is the guy that deleted emails and then misled Congress about it. He initially said he didn't -- then went back and had to change his testimony. So I feel like this guy really felt he was in hot water, and then he had to follow an order later on to use a special program and prove all the emails are gone.BAIER: So is the bleach bit guy on this list. And, remember, that these people don't have security clearance, and they were dealing with classified emails on this server, Lisa.BOOTHE: I think it raises a whole host of questions. And particularly, too, these are going to be the folks that are going to serve with Hillary Clinton in her administration if she becomes president of the United States, Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin. And there's also increased scrutiny or there should be increased scrutiny about Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin and what role they played and the fact that you have Cheryl Mills and her work with the Clinton Foundation while serving at the Clinton Foundation or Huma Abedin who worked at the Clinton foundation, the State Department as well. So it raises a lot of questions about that.It also puts Comey, FBI Director Comey in the hot seat who is coming before Congress next week and sort of his dealings and his discretion and his, the investigation, it raises a lot of questions that I'm sure are going to be brought to the forefront next week.BAIER: In fact, Charles, late today, 5:30, we get another document dump from the FBI about these interviews, these 302 interviews. We are going through them to see what's in them. But this is kind of a thing that happens, this document dump. It's traditional in Washington. But for the FBI to say they are being transparent in this investigation, that doesn't appear to be true.KRAUTHAMMER: Something ironic is happening. It's not just we got used to a year of the drip, drip, drip for Hillary's reputation, for honesty, transparency, et cetera. But now that is happening to Comey's reputation. He came into this as a shining knight for what he had done in the Reagan years, especially if you do something that appears to be sort of against the conservative consensus you get to be a Washington hero.But playing off that, everything that we have seen since the press conference where he said he wasn't going to prosecute, makes you wonder what in God's name is going on. If the Watergate inquiry had been handled the way that this is, giving out immunity, allowing the witness, the sort of the co-conspirator, if you like, to act as the principle's lawyer, as Cheryl Mills was, it is truly scandalous. And because it's an election year and this is all going to be swept away, if she wins, nobody will remember it. And if she loses, nobody will care.BAIER: We'll see how much is covered.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Did Secretary Clinton focus too much or not enough on Donald Trump?Former Democratic presidential candidate Congressman Dennis Kucinich is here to go ON THE RECORD.Good evening, sir.DENNIS KUCINICH, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hi, Greta.VAN SUSTEREN: Did Secretary Clinton focus too much on Donald Trump? Not enough? Or just right?KUCINICH: I tend to think that the entire convention was wrapped around an anti-Trump infomercial. And I don't think that actually helps Secretary Clinton, who needs to build public confidence in, not only in her performance in the capacities that she has, but needs to build public trust.And if you deflect that by attacking someone, some of the underlying issues that are out there are not going to be addressed. And so I think she probably lost some opportunities.VAN SUSTEREN: So are you saying she basically took the bait from Donald Trump and engaged in sort of a street fight with him, rather than sort of rising above it and talking about the big issues? Is that another way to say it or not?KUCINICH: I think that if she proceeds to rise above it and acts as a master of policy and works off her political biography, notwithstanding any differences that any of us may have, that would be the best tact for her.But if she goes negative and if this campaign turns into a mud wrestling, I think Trump benefits, frankly.VAN SUSTEREN: Why would he benefit more than she would from the mud wrestling?KUCINICH: Because challengers generally will benefit more from negative attacks.Hillary Clinton is running as an incumbent in some ways. And so I don't think the negative attacks help her with the stature that she already has. She should be gathering the stature that she has from all the different offices she has held, and without regard to the issues, you know, whether she was right or wrong, she has been a primary player in American politics for a quarter century.Why give that up to get into a street fight with Donald Trump?VAN SUSTEREN: Here's what Donald Trump said, a little bit of what he said after her speech.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I have been nice. But after watching that performance last night, such lies. I don't have to be so nice anymore. I'm taking the gloves off, right? Yes?(END VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: I don't know if he had been so nice. I mean, he has done some name-calling calling her ""Crooked Hillary.""KUCINICH: Well, absolutely, that's name calling. And I will tell you, there is a Harvard study that suggests that these kinds of negative attacks on both sides could shrink and polarize an electorate.So, the Democrats need a big turnout. That's another reason why Hillary Clinton needs to weigh whether the attacks on Donald Trump could actually frustrate Democratic turnout.VAN SUSTEREN: See, there was one report that we had that 80,000 Democrats in the State of Pennsylvania are now registered as Republicans.KUCINICH: Right.VAN SUSTEREN: I think the problem that she has that a lot of people really fed up, do anybody but anyone who is considered part of Washington. You know, it's just essential to get an outsider.KUCINICH: Well, in this change climate, it is true that people who have been Democrats have registered Republican. They are definitely going to be Trump voters.Hillary Clinton's challenge is to get a massive turnout. And to do that, I don't think you can run a negative campaign. I think you have to inspire people. You lift them up so that on Election Day, they want to turn out for a really good person for president.VAN SUSTEREN: Congressman, always nice to see you. Thank you, sir.KUCINICH: It's good to be with you."
