It's coming to a head, ladies and gentlemen. Now last night, I hammered Newark, New Jersey Mayor Cory Booker for not being tough enough on illegal alien criminals. I talked with the mayor today. He is reconsidering his position.Shortly after yesterday's segment, I received this letter from Anthony in New Jersey: ""I'm a probation officer in this state and we are routinely issued memos by the judiciary ordering us not to contact ICE when we receive an illegal alien on probation. Despite that order, I have contacted ICE on four separate occasions because I deemed the men to be dangerous. After my call, two of them were deported and two others picked up by the Feds.""Anthony is to be commended for protecting the public. The governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine is to be challenged, even though today the Jersey attorney general ordered local police to contact ICE when a suspected alien is arrested on serious charges.Likewise, the mayors of Portland, Oregon and Houston, Texas, both sanctuary cities, have explaining to do. In Portland Tom Potter is soft on illegal aliens, affording them every protection he can. Potter continues to do this, despite the murder of 15-year-old Danny Countryman, who was allegedly strangled by Alejandro Gamboa, an illegal with a drunk driving conviction.Clackamas County authorities never reported Gamboa to ICE after his first conviction. That murder happened near Portland, not in the city. But Portland still refuses to alert ICE about criminal alien arrests in most cases.Likewise in Houston where Mayor Bill White watched as Juan Salinas was charged with killing a family of three in a drunk driving crash. Salinas, an illegal from Mexico, had two prior charges -- assault and public intoxication. But ICE knew nothing about him.The soft system in Harris County released Salinas on $1,500 bail. That's $150 cash. So he was free to kill the Williams family, including two-year-old Xavier.Now clear thinking Americans understand the failure of local authorities to inform the Feds about illegal criminal activity is insane. Every arrest is public information. Every one. So there's no reason on this earth why ICE should not be informed immediately when aliens are taken into custody. It's just common sense.The Feds can track criminal records in foreign countries, while the locals can't. The Feds may have the alien on a terror watch list that the locals know nothing about.The reason Mayors Booker, Potter, White and others failed to aggressively combat alien crime is political. The men are all liberal, all Democrats. And they're playing to their perceived base.So politics is trumping public safety. And innocent Americans are dying because of it. That's not acceptable. And Congress must now get involved and withhold funding from sanctuary cities. We'll have more on that tomorrow. And we do expect new legislation this fall dealing with specific alien crime. And that's ""The Memo.""Most Ridiculous ItemTime for ""The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day."" Some BillOReilly.com business.

 Politics of Tragedy 
"	"And now the most telling two minutes in television, the latest from the political grapevine:Politics of TragedyWhile Democrats have accused President Bush of exploiting September 11th for political ends, Washington Post columnist David Broder writes that the president is -- ""a piker compared with FDR when it comes to wrapping himself in the mantle of commander in chief.""In 1944, President Roosevelt accepted the Democratic nomination not from the Chicago convention but from the San Diego Naval Station, saying -- ""the war waits for no elections. Decisions must be made, plans must be laid, strategy must be carried out.""The Convention's keynote speaker, meanwhile, said -- ""The Republican Party...had no program, in the dangerous years preceding Pearl Harbor, to prevent war or to meet it if it came.""Extra-Court ActivitiesAs conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia takes heat for his involvements outside of court, the LA Times reports that liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has maintained strong ties to a women's rights organization that often argues cases before the court.The National Organization of Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund co-sponsors the Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Distinguished Lecture Series on Women and the Law, where Justice Ginsburg spoke two weeks after siding with the legal defense fund's brief in a medical case.Federal judicial guidelines instruct judges to avoid pursuing activities where -- ""impartiality might reasonably be questioned.""Praising AbbasPalestinian Leader Yasser Arafat is praising convicted Palestinian terrorist Abu Abbas, who died this week in American custody in Iraq. Abbas headed the Palestinian Liberation Front and masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship in which wheelchair bound American tourist Leon Klinghoffer was shot and thrown overboard. Arafat called Abbas a martyr and a -- ""distinguished fighter and a national leader who devoted his life to serve his own people and his homeland.""Stay out, America...Landowners in a small German town have written President Bush asking the United States to stay off their property. They're worried that the president's recent pledge to build a lunar space station will bring unwanted visitors to their 700,000 square meter estates on the moon.Twelve hundred town residents paid about $20 three years ago to buy the extra terrestrial land from an American businessman, who claimed that a loophole in the UN Outer Space Treaty gave him legal ownership of the moon. Now, many are now warning President Bush that they -- ""don't want landing flags or rusting vehicles dumped on their land.""-- FOX News' Michael Levine contributed to this report"	[]	[]
