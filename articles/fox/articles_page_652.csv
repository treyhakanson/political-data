Biden apology tour shows how truth-telling morphs into a gaffe	"By Greta Van SusterenLet's all go ""Off the Record."" I want to talk to you about Vice President Biden's latest apology tour. It started after he said our Middle East allies are partly to blame for ISIS gaining strength. I was thinking about something Ambassador Bolton said on last night's show, which is absolutely true, but reflects poorly on the state of politics. Here is what the ambassador said:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BOLTON, FORMER AMBASSADOR TO U.N.: I think the vice president is guilty of the ultimate Washington gaffe - which is telling the truth in part and that's why he has had to apologize.(END VIDEO CLIP)So let me get this straight - and I make the assumption that prior to Vice President Biden going public, he and President Obama both brought this up privately with our allies to no avail. So now we are at the point where the vice president speaks the truth publicly about our allies, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates and he is forced on an apology tour? Did Vice President Biden lie? Nope. Get his facts wrong? Nope. He just ruffled the wrong feathers.I guess Jack Nicholson was right:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JACK NICHOLSON, FROM 'A FEW GOOD MEN': You can't handle the truth!(END VIDEO CLIP) Speaking of truth, it has now morphed into a gaffe. Now, you have to admit that's really messed up. And that's my ""Off the Record"" comment tonight."
