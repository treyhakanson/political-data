All of them.I think those who perpetrate scandals hope--not much.That we'll get hot and bothered, for a while, but only for a while.I hope they're wrong.Because taking the politics out of all this, focus more on just the creepiness of all this.Not a single scandal. But what has become scandalous.Leave the agency involved out of it.Focus on the fact it's the United States government doing it--all of it.Collecting phone records.And e-mail records.And health records.And tax records.Maybe you're just shrugging your shoulders. Maybe you're just saying I'm nuts.Go ahead and argue they're doing all this to protect us.Even say this is the price of technology enjoyed by all of us.Look in the mirror and say you don't mind one bit all the other faces looking back.That's really what this is about right now.Just how much intrusion we can take right now.Or whether we'll just forget this nonsense not too long from now.That's what government hopes, I suspect.That these annoying peon citizens will get all peeved, but move on soon.To their barbecues, and baseball games, and the everyday distractions that are a part of life.Forgetting all the while the government over-reach that threatens that life.They're assuming we'll forget, and that's where all this is going.Let's show them that if they think our memories are that short?They've got another thing coming.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Back on this side of the pond, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign ramping up efforts to tear down a book filled with allegations that are threatening her White House hopes. The book is called ""Clinton Cash."" It details an alleged pattern of behavior where former Secretary of State, now president candidate Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton have profited off of relationships with individuals and entities who had business before her State Department. Over the past weeks and especially the last few days, the campaign, allies and even President Clinton have gone all out to try to discredit this book and its author.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, 42ND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Even the guy that wrote the book apparently, had to admit under questioning that he didn't have a shred of evidence for this. He just sort of thought he would throw it out there and see if it'd fly.UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It's full of sloppy research and attacks pulled out of thin air with no actual evidence.UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It's a book that's written by a former Bush operative. He's cherry-picked information that's been disclosed and woven a bunch of conspiracy theories about it.UNIDENTIFIED MAN: There's everything here but that she did anything -- this is spaghetti journalism. There's throw spaghetti at the wall and hope something sticks.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining us now is the spaghetti maker, Peter Schweizer, author of ""Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.""Peter, good to see you. So, I mean, obviously, what those clips show is they are a little worried about you. And that's obvious. But their main line of attack seems to be, there's no there there, there's smoking gun. Something you've admitted yourself.PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR, ""CLINTON CASH"": Well, what I argue is the smoking gun, I don't have an e-mail that says, do this and we'll give you money. What I do have is a pattern of behavior that I think is very troubling. And the pattern is revealed in dozens of examples where there's an influx of money to the Clintons. Hillary Clinton and shortly thereafter takes favorable actions for the individuals who are giving them the money. You can look at one of two of these, Megyn, and say, come on, it's a coincidence. But when you see it replicated dozens of times, I think it warrants serious investigation by people that have subpoena power that can look at e-mails, that can look at correspondence.KELLY: They don't seem to think it counts unless there is direct proof. They don't seem to believe in circumstantial evidence when it comes to their behavior.SCHWEIZER: Yes, that's exactly right. I mean, here's what I like to say, Megyn. Imagine three years from now we have a secretary of defense not named Clinton and she has a private foundation with her husband and a small company has business before the Pentagon, needs Pentagon approval for something and the shareholders in that company send $145 million to that family foundation. Are people going to just ask them, did anything happen here and we're going to take their word that everything was good? Of course not, we would investigate and look into it except for the fact that when it involves the Clintons they seem to operate on a level that's very different than anybody else in American politics.KELLY: What should happen though? Because now she is going to testify before the Benghazi committee, at least. So, I mean, that she'll get asked and she will have to answer, correct?SCHWEIZER: Yes, you know, I don't know in terms of the committee what the scope of their questioning is going to be, but look, I think we need to have somebody that has subpoena power look into some of these deals. We need to look at some of the inflated speaking fees that Bill Clinton got as she was considering everything from the Keystone Pipeline to issues related to sanctions on Iran.KELLY: Who would look into it? Who specifically? I mean, O'Reilly is looking for the FBI to do it. Who specifically?SCHWEIZER: Well, I think the FBI is an excellent suggestion. You could have Congressional committees do it. Frankly, I think I'd like to see somebody with subpoena power that is a prosecutor, possibly even convene a grand jury. I mean, look, you look at the Menendez case, you look at the case down in Virginia, you look out in Oregon with Keith Saber (ph), the pattern of behavior here is somewhat similar. And it is crying out for further investigation.KELLY: Peter Schweizer, thanks for being here.SCHWEIZER: Thanks, Megyn.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.
