Sooner or later, every president's standing comes to depend on results, and this president is in desperate need of better results. Making a big speech right now is probably the last thing he should do. His aides are privately trying to downplay the expectations, but the setting of a joint session of Congress says it all. Such sessions are usually reserved for highly distinguished foreign visitors, or for presidents with urgent or major messages to communicate. Mr. Obama is going to announce a set of ideas he's had since sometime last month, but thought insufficiently new or important that they could wait until his vacation was over.From what is known of the ideas, he was right that they could wait. Another grab-bag of spending and minor tax cuts of the sort that made up his ill-fated and staggeringly costly stimulus package. Such proposals are unlikely to wow the public, unlikely to pass, and even if they did, unlikely to generate the economic results he -- and the country -- so badly need.Mr. Obama may be planning to beat Republicans over the head for not passing them, but that is a classic case of dealing with the politics of his problem, rather than the problem itself.It's too late for that too.

The evidence mounts that no one in the high councils of the Obama administration has any idea of how to get the economy out of its current rut.Senior adviser David Axelrod recited the familiar litany on Sunday -- we inherited a huge mess from George W. Bush; the stimulus really has made things better; yes, we need tough new financial regulations to avert another scandalous Wall Street collapse.Axelrod insisted the administration is not anti-business and it may not be. But the president has never worked for -- let alone run -- a business and nearly all those around him are from the worlds of politics, government and academia. The possibility that businesses are not investing and hiring because of deep uncertainty about everything from taxes to credit to regulation seems lost on them. They believe deeply that the driving force in a robust economy is aggregate demand and that dispensing cash through government spending is the way to stimulate that demand.But what's needed now is not just investment to meet current demand for products. What's needed now is investment in the expectation that the products produced will themselves create demand and that the rewards for taking the risk will not be taxed away by a government insatiable for revenue to cover its spending and insistent on ever more regulation to keep greedy businesses in line.In other words, lower taxes, lighter regulation and less government spending -- the exact opposite of the policies now in place.

But the greatest impact in these areas may well come from neither Congress nor the White House.Obamacare will almost certainly survive Republican efforts to undo it, since President Obama would veto any repeal and his party has the votes to sustain that. The court challenges to Obamacare are a different matter.One federal judge has already ruled the mandate on all citizens to purchase health care unconstitutional. If the Supreme Court were ultimately to agree, the whole financing scheme for Obamacare would collapse and with it, the extension of health insurance to tens of millions of uninsured. Obamacare as we know it would be finished.As for the deficit, an up-tick in economic growth would provide a surge of tax receipts that would immediately cut the annual deficit, perhaps sharply. That happened in the latter years of the Clinton administration when the treasury actually ran a surplus and in the middle years of the Bush administration when, despite two wars and heavy domestic spending, the deficit declined.Neither of the above scenarios may come to pass, but they illustrate why the big events in politics often occur beyond the halls of Congress and beyond the White House.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" August 15, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   ANDY BARKETT, RNC CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER: We want to win. We want to win elections. That's our goal. We want to win '14; we want to win '16. We want to win every election after that. Right now what we're investing in is we're investing in building stuff. The stuff that we're building is the data science, the analytics to figure out which voters we need to be going after.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   JOHN ROBERTS, ANCHOR: That's Andy Barkett, he's the Republican National Committee's new chief technology officer, and he is charged with beating the Democrats at their own game in 2016, and that is data-mining in order to find out where those voters are who are persuadable to your side. So let's look at politics and the RNC right now with Tucker Carlson, we're back with Julie Pace, and Charles Krauthammer. The Democrats had a great game on the digital side of things in 2012. Can the Republicans, Charles, match them?  CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I don't see why not. I mean, it's true that the smart, young technologists are probably predominantly liberal, but there are enough of them. How many do you need, 50, 100, in the whole country that could actually the RNC at least match what the DNC did? So I don't see why in principle that's going to be difficult. I think the real story is, what's the message? What's the best way to approach young people and minorities? And it isn't only African American minorities, Hispanic. And interesting enough, of all the minorities you would have expected would have been split evenly would have been Asian-Americans, who have done extremely well economically, and yet they were overwhelmingly on the Democratic side. That actually is a puzzle that I think the RNC ought to think about and think about a message that would be more appealing. What are they missing in this?   ROBERTS: So the Republican National Committee, Republicans across the country getting together for three days up in Boston, Julie, to talk about the way forward, how they win in 2014, how they win in 2016. Give us a little bit of a playbook here. What do they need to do other then get more people to vote for them?  JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, 2014 doesn't look like a bad year for Republicans at this point. I think if you talk to most political analysts, the House looks pretty safe for Republicans. Some of the Senate races are looking good for Republicans. The Democrats are having a hard time recruiting in some states. 2016 is where the puzzle is still a little unsolvable. It's just not a matter of building stuff, as Andy said. It's a matter of crafting a message that will appeal to new people. It's not just that they didn't reach the voters that they needed and get them out to the polls and find where their addresses were and their polling places were. They just didn't have the electorate that actually couldn't trump the electorate that the Democrats had.ROBERTS: And you've got to have compelling candidates as well when you are looking at the 2016 race, Tucker. And part of this RNC summer meeting is to put forward the new stars of the Republican Party -- the Marco Rubios, the Chris Christies. But when you look at those two people, they are being undercut by certain factions of the party at the same time that the RNC is trying to put them out there to say this is our future.TUCKER CARLSON, EDITOR, THEDAILYCALLER.COM: The final question is who is going to unite the party. The divisions are really deep and significant. And you think at the end, you know, some Reagan-like figure will come and convince the libertarians to get along with the establishment Republicans, with whatever the neocons are, whatever. It's almost hard to see anybody in the field now who is going to be capable of doing that. The divisions are really bitter. There is just a tiny union set of beliefs between, say, Rand Paul and Chris Christie. The sniping between them I think is at a higher level than the normal sniping between potential candidates. It's heart-felt.ROBERTS: And you've got one or two, if you've got a broad Republican field, the sniping at each other with Hillary Clinton already the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party, having such a wide field, does it help the candidates or does it hurt them? But the other aspect of the Hillary Clinton story is that you know, she moving into the building of the Clinton Foundation taking up a couple of floors. What are your thoughts on all of that?KRAUTHAMMER: It's an association I'm not sure is going to help her politically. It's a perfect reflection of the persona of her husband. If you had to describe him and his presidency, you would say successful, charming, as always, rouge-ish, and sloppy, disorganized. I'm talking about the way he ran his White House, the pizza at 3:00 a.m., the stuff where it was like a bull session in college that went on and on. And that is reflected in the foundation, which has got as the New York Times showed in a very long article. These connections with corporate, celebrity, with money, with people who are self-dealing, is pretty messy. And I'm not sure if you are a candidate, despite Hillary's celebrity and how much she is adored by Democrats, it's a difficult association and it could be harmful.ROBERTS: Julie, just quickly, we've only got a few seconds left here. Politics -- philanthropy too close to politics here?PACE: Well, I don't think that anybody is going to be voting for or against Hillary Clinton based on what the Clinton Foundation is doing, but I think that that article and other articles you've seen really underscore the question that she has to answer, which is does she want to go through the scrutiny that she would have to run for president.ROBERTS: Sign of the scrutiny she'll face? Tucker?CARLSON: Do you think Hillary Clinton is going to be a great candidate? Go back and look at tape of her speeches from '08. Yeah, it will remind you. Brutal.ROBERTS: Thanks, folks. That's it for the panel, but stay tuned as some clever tactics get caught on camera. We'll be right back.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" May 7, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Today Republicans are systematically and deliberately trying to stop millions of American citizens from voting. What part of democracy are they afraid of?GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO: We have 28 days of voting in Ohio. Her home state of New York has one day. So maybe the first thing she ought to do is work on her own state.Look, I don't say anything about her emails or all this other stuff, but when you start saying that you are going to sue Ohio and that Republicans are deliberately working to deny people the right to vote, I'm outraged by it. And frankly, one should mine their own store before they get up trashing other people who are doing far better than what they have done.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Ohio Governor John Kasich, one of the Republicans responding to Hillary Clinton and her charge that Republicans are trying to prevent people from voting across the country. We're back with our panel. A bit of lightning round here first on this voting rights issue. Julie?JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, there is some pretty clear politics happening on two fronts here. One, Democrats like to wield voting rights as an issue because they think that it puts Republicans in a position of having to defend actions that would stop people from voting. That's an awkward position to be in for anyone. And, two, this is an issue that is popular with a lot of people who voted for Barack Obama, African-Americans in particular, and that's a block she will need big support from if she is going to win in general election.BAIER: Nina?NINA EASTON, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: That's exactly right. He's pulling a page right out of the Obama playbook trying to gin up the base.BAIER: She is.EASTON: She is, I'm sorry, with these totally specious arguments. I mean, voter I.D. laws to combat fraud are fine. There is nothing wrong with them. They are not discriminatory. And this idea that to extend the voting before Election Day, there is pros and cons to that. To say that Republicans are trying to tamp down the vote is ridiculous, but, unfortunately, it works.BAIER: I saw a lot of reporting how this was a genius move by Hillary Clinton to stir everything up, to get the base motivated. I did not see a lot of reporting that this is a reaction to softening poll numbers for Hillary Clinton and that maybe she needs to stir up the base.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Yes. I think it helps her in a lot of ways politically and cynically because it distracts attention from all the scandals swarming around her. But I kind of like Kasich's outrage, because that -- you know, and it's his sort of essentially him. That is not a manufactured outrage which is sort of so common in Washington. He was outraged. He believes in equal rights, and he doesn't like being accused of not supporting that. I think that was a real good moment for him.BAIER: OK, it's Friday, so you know where we head -- to the Candidate Casino. And there are a lot of declared candidates now, 10 of them, and many other perspective candidates in coming days. So, let's talk about the Republican field that's expanding. Julie?PACE: You know I love the casino, so I have been toggling back and forth at the top between Rubio and Walker. I've got Rubio at 40 and Walker at 30 for this week. Jeb at 25, not a lot of enthusiasm and momentum, but he has a launch coming up, a formal launch, so we will see if he can gain there. And I'm saving five for Cruz simply because I think he is going to raise a lot of grassroots money and that can equal a lot of enthusiasm.BAIER: Nina?EASTON: I lowered my bet on Jeb Bush. I think the traction is not following the dollars. Marco Rubio I think is gaining traction, and I'm upping my bet on him. Scott Walker interestingly took on another target beyond unions, and that is the tenure of university professors. I think that's a brilliant move politically and will really help him with the base. I gave him more than I have in the past.BAIER: OK, a couple of viewers, Clayton Tyler, first of all, $75 on Rubio, $10 each on Walker and Bush, $3 on Fiorina. And then Sam Hooks, Charles, $25 on Rubio, $25 on Walker, $20 on Cruz, and $5 for Donald Trump vs. Charles Krauthammer debate.KRAUTHAMMER: I'm going to pass on that last one.(LAUGHTER)KRAUTHAMMER: I got my top three, as always. Rubio on top, Walker, Bush, trailing, and now I have a sort of new thing, because you complain about the way I broke the rules last week. So I am looking at the people outside the top tier who have the best chance of jumping in to the top tier, although I don't expect any of them to win the nomination. And my trio are Cruz, Fiorina, and Kasich, who I think are the most likely of the pack to make an impression and join the top.BAIER: OK. And you can always weigh in online, Twitter, Facebook, on the homepage. All right, quickly, winners and losers?KRAUTHAMMER: China, winner, a massive cyber-attack on the United States, no response. And then my loser, Hillary Clinton for the aforementioned race baiting statement she made. I think it's made rather cynically. It's cheap demagoguery. Yes, all candidates do that and Republicans in the past have played the race card, but it's a particularly sensitive issue and I think it should be called out any time it's done.BAIER: Nina?EASTON: My winner sadly is Edward Snowden who was able to take advantage of this NSA debate to pose himself as a hero with a ""New York Times"" op-ed. My loser is Lincoln Chafee who jumped into the race for Democratic presidential stakes this week, on reinstituting or instituting the metric system and, worse, comparing us to Burma and Libya.BAIER: Oh, yes. Julie?PACE: For my winner, I'm taking a page out of the Charles Krauthammer playbook and going with the White House hawk who already had a shout out earlier in the show, big star at the White House this week. And my loser is Mitch McConnell, typically seen as a master dealmaker on Capitol Hill but really surprised a lot of people with his handling of the NSA debate.BAIER: That is it for the panel. But stay tuned to hear one contender's plan for America.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi, I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight.Let's get straight to our top story: Donald Trump versus Ted Cruz. Both sides are unleashing vicious broad sides against each other with their attacks escalating over the past few days.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have never seen anybody that lied as much as Ted Cruz. He is a lying guy -- a really lying guy. Some people misrepresent, this guy is just a plain out liar.SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Truth matters. You cannot simply scream ""liar"" when somebody points out the actual position of Donald Trump. So I will continue to focus on substance and truth and let other candidates focus on the insults and attack.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And the Cruz campaign isn't stopping there. Releasing a fresh attack ad, taking aim at Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Between sips of wine and bites of salad, a Planned Parenthood doctor discusses getting money for tissue from aborted fetuses.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Harvesting the organs of aborted fetuses for money.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Planned Parenthood treats the unborn like another form of currency. And yet, some politicians still defend them.TRUMP: Planned Parenthood serves a good function. We have to look at the positives.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donald Trump is just plain wrong.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And Trump fired back today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: This guy, Cruz, comes out. Well I don't think he is going to win. This guy is so strident and so nasty he is going to lose every single state.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Well this battle between Trump and Cruz isn't costing Trump support, at least not yet. A new survey by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic group shows Trump maintaining a strong lead in South Carolina with 35 percent of likely Republican voters backing him. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are tied for second at 18 percent, followed by John Kasich at 10 percent then Jeb Bush and Ben Carson tied at 7 percent.Joining us now with reaction from Columbia, South Carolina Alice Stewart, senior adviser for the Cruz campaign; and from Dallas Trump national spokesperson Katrina Pierson.Now, Katrina and Alice, no two better people sitting right here to debate all recent events between your two candidates. I'm going to start with you Katrina. Donald has said Ted Cruz has repeatedly lied about him and is ready to sue. Is that the case? Will Trump sue Cruz for libel?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Well, he actually might, considering how a lot of these attacks against Mr. Trump are not true. And specifically with this new ad on Planned Parenthood, Donald Trump simply says that cervical cancer screening for poor women is a good thing, even though he opposes abortion and opposes funding for abortion for Planned.The Cruz campaign wants to take it a little bit further. It's obvious that Senator Cruz needs South Carolina to move forward and he is not going to stop at anything, including misrepresenting his positions on pretty much everything at this point -- Eric.BOLLING: Ok. Alice, is Ted Cruz concerned about being sued in the middle of a fight for the GOP nomination?ALICE STEWART, CRUZ CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Well, if Donald Trump wants to sue, bring it on. The fact of the matter is Ted Cruz has done nothing but point out Donald Trump's exact words, exactly as he said them.And he has said that he supports the nation's largest abortion provider. He has said he is pro-choice. He has said that Planned Parenthood does some great things. And so -- I want to ask Katrina, the nation's largest abortion provider, how can he compete in a state like South Carolina when he supports abortion?BOLLING: Katrina.PIERSON: Well, first, I would like to ask Alice if she actually believes Mr. Trump supports abortion because the ads that the campaign are running are from 17 years ago. Mr. Trump hasn't been pro-abortion for a very long time. He has been pro-life. He has told stories on the campaign trail about that transition.Senator Cruz props up people like Ronald Reagan who, as governor of California, signed the most liberal piece of abortion legislation in that state, in the country's history, Alice.Mr. Trump is pro-life and the Cruz campaign knows it.BOLLING: Alice.STEWART: Well, it was just last week when we were on the debate stage when Donald Trump said that he supports taxpayer funding for the nation's largest abortion provider. We are talking last week not 17 years ago. He has said repeatedly that he is --(CROSSTALK)PIERSON: Mr. Trump said he supports the good things, the good things like cervical. Do you think poor women shouldn't have cervical cancer screenings?STEWART: Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion provider. He supports the nation's largest abortion provider and South Carolina is a pro-life state. The Republican Party is a pro-life party. And you cannot go around saying that you are pro-life when you support funding for Planned Parenthood. In addition to that he has said repeatedly that he thinks they do good things.He has also said he supported Democrat candidates over the years.KIERSON: He also supported Ted Cruz. He's donated to Ted Cruz.BOLLING: Hold on guys. We can go back and forth on this. I mean Alice, honestly, there are a lot of candidates who change positions on certain things, for example on immigration. Some would say Ted Cruz has changed his position on immigration over the years as well. Should you be holding Donald Trump to the standard of what he said as Katrina points out -- I'm not sure about that 17 years ago number. If, in fact, it was 17 years ago that he said it, should he be held to that standard now?STEWART: He should be held to the standard of what he said on the debate stage just last week, Eric. That's what people are basing their decision on.And when it comes to immigration, no one has fought harder against Marco Rubio and the Gang of Eight and their amnesty program than Ted Cruz in Washington, D.C. Here's the fact. I'm in South Carolina. We have been out on the campaign trail for days here in South Carolina talking to South Carolinians about issues that they are concerned with.Not some Donald Trump just calling his opponents liars and nasty. Ted Cruz this morning gave a phenomenal national security speech here in Charleston where he talked about the importance of funding and building up our military. Barack Obama has spent the past seven years with our national security on the back burner. Ted Cruz will put it on the front burner.This afternoon, we were out on the campaign trail with Texas governor, former governor Rick Perry and Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Myer. Talking about our vets --BOLLING: Katrina, now --PIERSON: Donald Trump is pro-life and has been for a very long time. We too are on the ground in South Carolina listening to the voters who think that a lot of these things that the Cruz campaign are too doing have very sleazy from Iowa all the way to South Carolina with these horrible push polls.I will say this with regard to immigration. Donald Trump is the most solid on immigration as we have seen and the only reason we are having this discussion is because of Donald Trump. On Senator Cruz's own YouTube page, he is praising bringing Syrian refugees to this country because it's the right thing to do for America. He flip-flopped on that after Mr. Trump came out against it. He supported increasing HB1 visas and green cards.BOLLING: Right. We can't go through the complete platforms of both candidates. What I would like to talk about a little bit and we don't have a ton of time. I'm going to start with you Katrina, in the aftermath of the last debate where Donald Trump had mentioned some things about George W. Bush yet afterwards the poll numbers haven't seem to have budged. Is he concerned -- are you hearing on the ground that that's going to affect anything going forward going into Saturday's primary?PIERSON: No. Not at all, Eric. The people on the ground in South Carolina and all over the country are tired of the transnational corporations backed people like Senator Ted Cruz who promotes Obama trade. They are tired of it. They want their jobs back. They want to make things in this country again. They want to secure the borders. They want to stop immigration. They want to deport criminal aliens.The people on the ground get it. They are very used to politics and politic politicians alike and that's why we see the poll numbers staying the same.BOLLING: And what do you say Alice. Is Ted Cruz concerned that the poll numbers in the aftermath of the -- what a lot of people thought this was the one thing that's going to give Donald Trump his numbers to come down after all the other things. This was going to be the one because George W. Bush seems to be beloved, but it hasn't seemed to budge. Is Ted Cruz concerned that maybe he shouldn't have picked this fight?STEWART: Well, here's the thing. Ted Cruz has done nothing more than point out Donald Trump's own record and his own words. And for -- it's sad that Katrina has to defend someone who basically says anyone that calls out his record is lying. That's a pretty weak defense. And just by saying someone is a liar does not address the issue. So, you know, it's unfortunate.BOLLING: Here is where the rubber meets the road. You look at the last poll, the poll we just sited Ted Cruz was solidly in second prior to that poll. Now he is tied for second. His numbers have slid a bit. Is this a concern in the Cruz camp?STEWART: We are encouraged by the crowds we've seen here on the ground in South Carolina. We are making tens of thousands of phone calls every day and knocking on doors and having tremendous surrogates out here on the trail with us. And keep in mind, the polls have Donald Trump in first in Iowa and we had a resounding victory in Iowa.We are looking forward to Saturday.BOLLING: We're going to have to leave it right there, ladies. Thank you very much. Hot debate.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
