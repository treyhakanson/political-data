Now the conservative Weekly Standard contends, even as he criticizes his Republican opponent Mark Kirk, Illinois Democratic Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias should be added to the list. His official campaign biography claimed Giannoulias: ""founded and chairs the AG Foundation -- a not-for-profit charity that donates money to treat child-related illnesses, curb poverty, and assist disaster relief organizations."" But the Standard reports the charity no longer exists and was only in existence from 2005 to 2006. The candidate's website has since updated ""chairs"" to past tense ""chaired.""Say Say Say You're SorryHouse Minority Leader John Boehner wants Paul McCartney to apologize to the American people for taking a swipe at former President George W. Bush.During Wednesday's concert at the White House, the former Beatle said: ""After the last eight years, it's good to have a president that knows what a library is.""Boehner tells Human Events: ""I was surprised and disappointed by the lack of grace and respect he displayed which demeaned him, the White House, and President Obama.""Communication BusinessPolitico reports there is another jump from the media to politics. ABC News deputy political director Teddy Davis says he's leaving the network to join the communications and politics team at SEIU, the Service Employees International Union. Conservative outlets are citing the move as another example of a liberal media bias. Imperfect CallMichigan lawmakers are going to bat for Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga. His bid for a perfect game ended Wednesday on a bad call by an umpire. Senator Debbie Stabenow is asking the Major League Baseball commissioner to nullify the call and award the perfect game.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.  It's still August, but the presidential race hits a new low as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton trade blistering accusations over race.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color only as votes.  HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  He is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party.  WALLACE:  Today, Donald Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, on Clinton tying Trump to the alt-right and the effort to keep Trump on message.  Then, the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee, Gary Johnson -- on his push to get on the stage for the presidential debate.  It's a ""Fox News Sunday"" exclusive.  Plus, we'll ask our panel whether Trump's position on deporting illegal immigrants will gain or cost him support.  And our power player of the week.  After dominating in Rio, what's next for Katie Ledecky?  KATIE LEDECKY, U.S. OLYMPIC SWIMMER:  I haven't been in the pool, and I'm starting to itch to get back in.  WALLACE:  All right now on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  It's been an ugly week on the trail as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton accused each other of racism.  Meanwhile, Trump is under fire for a possible shift on immigration, and Clinton faces new allegations about her private e-mails and the Clinton Foundation.  We still have 72 days until the election.  Joining me now is Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne, let's start with Hillary Clinton's emails -- almost 15,000 of them that the FBI has uncovered from her private server or from other accounts and handed over to the State Department.  The scandal over her private server, and the Clinton Foundation has been going on for a year now, more than a year.  What makes you think that there is a game changer in this new batch?  KELLYANNE CONWAY, DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Well, Chris, first, thanks for having me, giving the campaign a platform this morning.  Hillary Clinton achieved something this week that even I am impressed with.  She made her trust problem even worse.  And the new Quinnipiac poll out this week shows 66 percent of Americans say that she is dishonest, 29 percent think she's honest.  Those numbers have actually gotten worse since she announced her campaign over a year ago.  And she's earned that dishonesty and untrustworthiness because of the ever-growing scandal incident that you laid out that even though she said she had turned over all the emails to the FBI as part of their investigation, it turns out she has not.  What the director said last month, excuse me, about her being reckless and careless about thanks she had said turning out not to be true, the number of devices, the classified information, we see that there's still more happening.  And what is really amazing to me as put forth by ABC News last night in a report, laid out by the Associated Press this week, Chris, these aren't right wing websites.  This is the Associated Press and ABC showing Americans the revolving door between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation, and Americans have the right to be concerned.This is our State Department.  This is our public entity.  We don't want a straight line between the Clinton bank account, the State Department, the Clinton Foundation, and it doesn't -- it shows Americans how she may do business if she were elected in the White House.  WALLACE:  All right.  You've got your own issues with the Trump campaign.  This week began with Donald Trump appearing to back away from his pledge during the primaries that he was going to deport all 11 million illegals who were in this country.  But by the end of the week, he seemed to be backing away from backing away.  Here he is.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  There certainly can be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people.  We want people -- we have some great people in this country.  I don't think it's a softening.  It's --  ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  But 11 million people are no longer going to be departed.  TRUMP:  I've had people say it's hardening, actually.  (CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  There is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and come back.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Kellyanne, please clear this up for me.  Is Donald Trump saying that if someone has come into this country illegally -- so they broke the law, but they've broken no laws since then, been in the country for 10 years, 20 years, without breaking any other laws -- is he still going deport them, or is he going to let them stay?  CONWAY:  So, what he's said is very consistent, Chris.  Number one -- and this is important -- the signature piece of his legislation has, and his campaign, has always been build the wall.  That has not changed.  Build the wall.  No amnesty.  No citizenship.  No more sanctuary city.You know, the face of our campaign are people like Michelle and Julie and Laura and Agnes, these angel moms who stood with Donald Trump in different forms just this week, Chris, talking about their grievous losses, the loss of their children, all of whom were murdered by immigrants who should not have been there.  That's also part of Donald Trump's plan.  WALLACE:  But, Kellyanne, if I may --CONWAY:  Those who've committed, a crime, they're out of here.WALLACE:  If I may respectfully, he said in the campaign and said it on the debate stage -- I was there as one of the moderators -- ""I'm going to set up a deportation force, and all 11 million people who have come here illegally have to go.""  Do they, or don't they?  CONWAY:  And what he's said now is that he will look at that.  But he wants to look -- the softening is more approach than policy, Chris, because we -- did you -- in the clip that you played, you heard the words that followed it, that we need a fair and humane way of addressing the fact that 11 million -- or we don't know the number -- 11 million or so as estimated illegal immigrants live among us.  He wants to find a fair and humane way.  And if you enforce the law and you deal with those agencies that already exist to enforce the law, then we'll see what we've got.  I mean, nobody bothers to enforce the law.  They keep -- Washington always layers new laws on top of laws that don't work or unenforced to pretend to the American people that they're somehow being active on an issue.  But I think it's important to look at the five, six, seven main tenets in his overall --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  I understand, though, and I think you made them clear.  I just want to be clear, though.  What you seem to be saying is, you're leaving the door open that President Trump would consider the possibility of giving people who have not committed more crimes to living in this country legally.  CONWAY:  What he has said is no legalization and no amnesty.  He also said this week, Chris, that if you go back to your home country and if you'd like it come back to the United States as an immigrant, you need apply through the many different channels that allow people to apply for citizenship or entry into the United States legally.  And so, that's important.  We all learned in kindergarten to stand in line, to wait our turn.  He is saying that, as well.  Now, the deportation force, I would like to address that.  He hasn't mentioned that since last November.  So, I think in a few of the debates as you point out.  And if you look at his convention speech last month, he's consistent on that now in terms of addressing these many different areas of a very complex issue.  But I would really implore the viewers, Chris, and others to look at the contrast between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on immigration.  There are very few issues where they're more different.In fact, Hillary Clinton is to the left of Barack Obama on immigration.  She has been critical of President Obama deporting what's close to two million or more in some estimates, immigrants, in this country.  She says she will use executive amnesty.  She's for catch and release.  She's for the sanctuary cities that harbor illegal immigrants.  In the case of Kate Steinle, the man who murdered her right in front of her father over a year ago, Chris, he had been deported five times.  Why is he here?  So, everybody needs to be -- everything needs to be examined and looked upon.  But give Donald Trump credit for at least trying to address a complex issue and not pretending like Hillary Clinton does that we don't have these problems.  WALLACE:  All right.  Let's move on to another one.  Donald Trump has also been reaching out to African-Americans this week, asking, what do you have to lose after decades of Democratic neglect?  Here he is.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Poverty, rejection, horrible education, no housing, no homes, no ownership, crime at levels that nobody's seen.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLCE:  But, Kellyanne, that totally misrepresents what blacks face in this country.  Trump says black youth unemployment is 58 percent.  It's actually 19 percent.  Twenty-six percent of blacks live in poverty.  That's not good.  But the vast majority do not.  How can Trump address the problem when he doesn't seem to understand what it really is?  CONWAY:  So as I understand it, Chris, the 58 percent refers to the number of African-American youth who are not working.  But you're right.  We're also taking our message to African-Americans who are concerned about other things like lending, like housing, like discrimination.  They may be unsafe.  They may live in safe neighborhoods with fine schools, but it certainly isn't what their children deserve.  They deserve the same high-quality education as other children.  And that's his point.  And we just -- I sat with him and African-Americans on Wednesday, I believe it was, or Tuesday.  And we had a round table.  It was a very productive conversation where he did most of the listening.  And they laid out their concerns, they laid out their achievement.  WALLACE:  I want to --  CONWAY:  Yes?  WALLACE:  Well, I don't mean to interrupt, but we are running out of time.  I want to pick up on exactly that.  Trump has been running for president, though, Kellyanne, since June of 2015.  That's 14 months.  Question -- how many times has he gone in to an American inner city and held an event for a largely black audience?  CONWAY:  I don't know the answer, but I can tell you there are some --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Let me say, would you be surprised if the answer is none?  Never?  CONWAY: No, I would not be surprised.  I will tell you, Chris, and I pledge to you, and everybody who's watching that those events are actually being planned.  And we're very excited about them.  And, look, John McCain and Mitt Romney are fine -- they're wonderful human beings, great Americans.  They were fine presidential nominees.  John McCain got 4 percent of the African-American vote, and Mitt Romney improved that to a whopping 6 percent.  We're fighting for every single vote.  We're going to leave it all on the field.  And that includes going where the voters are and taking the case directly to them --WALLACE:  But you say that --(CROSSTALK)CONWAY:  -- the churches --WALLACE:  You say that, the fact is, in 14 month, he's never once been in an inner city and held an event for black Americans.  And this a tweet that Mr. Trump sent yesterday -- I'm sure you're familiar with it -- it's gotten a lot of attention after the tragic shooting of the cousin of basketball star Dwyane Wade.  Trump tweeted, ""Just what I've been saying.  African-Americans will vote Trump.""Do you think it's right to have that kind of a political response to a personal tragedy?  CONWAY:  I was pleased that his next tweet expressed his condolences to the Wade family, about the death of his cousin.  That horrifying example of a woman who had just signed up her children for school, pushing a baby stroller, that is a nonpartisan issue that should sicken us all.  And I also would express my condolences the entire family.  I'm pleased that he did.But, Chris, I'm new to this post, and he's going to take his case right to people where they live.  And that includes everyone.  We're vying for every vote.  Every ethnicity, both genders, every age group.This is an American presidential election, and he is going to -- I mean, look what Hillary Clinton did this week.  My goodness, she missed another opportunity to deliver a speech about Obamacare, energy, or infrastructure, the economy or ISIS.  She went and she elevated personal insults into an art form.  WALLACE:  Let me ask you -- let me --CONWAY:  At least he is talking policy.  WALLACE:  Let me ask you about that.  Hillary Clinton in the speech you're talking it said that Donald Trump is taking hate groups mainstream.  Here she is --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  Racists call themselves racialists.  White supremacists now call themselves white nationalists.  The paranoid fringe now calls itself alt-right.  But the hate burns just as bright.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  You say that she's making personal insults.  I mean, she does have a point.  The new CEO of the campaign, I guess he's your boss, is Steve Bannon, who's the head of Breitbart News.  Here are some of the headlines that Bannon has written on Breitbart, ""Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy.""  And, ""Would you rather your child had feminism or cancer?""  And he's called -- Breitbart has called -- rather, Bannon has called Breitbart the platform for the alt-right question.  Question, this is the man that Trump chose to run his campaign?  CONWAY:  Well, he chose me to manage his campaign, and I report directly to him.  But I will say this -- the idea that Hillary Clinton who's been in public life for 30 years gives a speech this week, Chris, about -- it was totally content-free, policy-free address about consultants is just remarkable to me.  I understand Hillary's campaign is now a hot mess.  Revelation after revelation, the Clinton Foundation, State Department, brand-new reports overnight that's reflected in the polls.  There's a new poll this morning by Morning Consult showing that we cut her lead nationally from six points to three points in just a matter of two weeks?  Why?  Because people are uncomfortable voting for someone that they think is corrupt and rigged.I know she's trying to divert attention away from her campaign and her State Department e-mail scandals, Clinton Foundation, foreign donations in the tens of millions of dollars by talking about consultants.  But the fact is that the hot mess that has become the Hillary candidacy cannot escape the fact that a majority of Americans think she is corrupt and rigged, and they're not going to want that in their next president.  WALLACE:  Finally, I've got about 30 seconds left.  There is a report that Donald Trump is going to be holding a debate prep session today at his golf course in New Jersey.  One, is that true?  And secondly, how is he preparing for debates?  Are you having mock sessions?  Is it true that Laura Ingraham is going to play Hillary Clinton?  Is he cramming thick briefing books?  CONWAY:  I'll be at lunch at Bedminster, and I'm sure we'll have a lively conversation.  Look, he's an unconventional candidate, and he's not going to prepare the way Hillary does which is, you know, locking her in a room and crammed her head with all those binders and get the Hollywood types that she raised gazillions of dollars with in fund-raisers this week instead of standing with sanctuary city moms, you know, who lost their children.  She's in Hollywood raising money.  She'll have them helping her consult.  He will be prepared for these debates.  All of his policy prescriptions that he's putting just in the last two weeks, Chris, on defeating radical Islamic terrorism, on middle-class tax relief, on law enforcement, on taking his case to the communities of color --WALLACE:  But is he going to hold -- just real quickly, is he going to hold mock debates?  CONWAY:  He might.  But remember, he's an unconventional -- and this idea of role playing Hillary Clinton -- Laura's a friend of all of ours.  And we appreciate any insight and advice that she is willing to give in her very busy life.  We take advice and we take counsel from many people who have experience and mean to be helpful.  But this -- you know, the Donald Trump, the authentic Donald Trump who's been taking his case directly to the voters is the one that you will see on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton.  And I think they're nervous over in Clinton camp because he is the x -- he's the unpredictable x factor.  She is a scripted, staged (ph) Hillary Clinton that basically memorizes lines.  You saw these two interviews she gave by phone this week on cable stations.  She obviously was reading something somebody gave her.  I didn't think they went well.  The scarcity as strategy that they use for Hillary Clinton, making sure that we don't see that much of her, that changes when she's forced to get to the debate stage.  And so, he will be preparing in a very different way.  WALLACE:  All right.  We're going to leave it there.  Kellyanne, thank you very much for coming on.  Thanks for your time.  Please come back.  CONWAY:  Thank you, Chris.  WALLACE:  Up next, the Clinton Foundation and private emails.  They're not going away as campaign issues for Hillary Clinton.  We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the latest revelations.  Plus, what would you like to ask the panel?  Will thousands of new emails create more problems for Clinton, or has the political damage already been done?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday.  We may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)TRUMP:  Hillary Clinton ran the State Department like a personal hedge fund.  It's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins.  CLINTON (via telephone):  Neither my husband, my daughter, nor I have ever taken a penny of the salary from the foundation.  My work as secretary of state was not influenced by any outside forces.  (END VIDEO CLIPS)WALLACE:  Hillary Clinton on defense, responding to Donald Trump's new focus on links between the foundation and Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state.  And it's time for our Sunday group.  Syndicated columnist George Will.  FOX News political analyst Juan Williams.  Susan Page from USA Today. And GOP strategist Karl Rove.Well, I want to start with the remarkable number that the Associated Press came up with this week and that Kellyanne Conway just referred to.During the first half of Clinton's time as secretary of state, she met with 154 people from private interests, not U.S. or foreign officials, 85 of them, more than half, were donors to the Clinton Foundation who contributed as much as $156 million to the foundation.  Karl, I don't have to tell you, money does buy access in this town.  So, is there anything new here?  KARL ROVE, GOP STRATEGIST:  Yes.  The volume is jaw-dropping.  You left out another number.  Nearly 150 phone calls, phone messages left by the CEO of the Clinton Foundation for Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton's chief of staff.  WALLACE:  At the State (ph).ROVE:  At State.So, how many phone calls was she able to receive beyond that?  This is a two-year period.  She left a message every three days.  It looks like she was constantly in communications.  Hillary Clinton says, ""I know there's a lot of smoke there, and there's no fire.""  Well, there's a lot of fire there.  The more we look at this, the more we see favors being traded, people being appointed to boards they shouldn't have been on.  People attending meetings that they shouldn't have been at, people being invited to state dinners, people being able to circumvent the normal process of the state department in order to get special pleading in front of the secretary.  WALLACE:  Juan, when you see all of the emails from people in the Clinton Foundation to Cheryl Mills to Huma Abedin, these are the people right at the right hand of Hillary Clinton in the State Department -- when you see the phone messages, all of that, does it trouble you?  The coziness of the relationship?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yes, it sets off alarm in my mind as a journalist.  I mean, even before I knew about the A.P. report, the phone calls and the like, I mean, the whole structure, Chris, seems to me to invite suspicion, the idea that there's some quid pro quo for access going on.  So, it's concerning to me.  Let me just state, in all fairness, I think the foundation does good work -- malaria, HIV, and the like.  But there's no getting away from the appearance of impropriety here.  I'm astounded that this foundation has existed since, in fact, 1997, during President Clinton's tenure.  I don't understand how she -- Mrs. Clinton -- doesn't see that this would invite people including the Boston Globe, Ed Rendell, fellow Democrats to say, this is a problem, you can't do this.  She had to sign an agreement with the Obama administration which she apparently violated by going about these phone calls, meeting people, even if it's -- you know, I don't think there's any evidence of impropriety.  Just by the standards you set, lots of people say, access is for money in this town.  But still, if there is no evidence of illegality, the appearance of trouble abounds.  WALLACE:  Let me quickly pick up with you on Karl, because that is the defense of the Clinton campaign at this point.  There's no smoking gun.  There's no official act that was done.  ROVE:  There's plenty of smoking guns available.  Steve Hayes has a great piece in this week's Weekly Standard on it.  Let me just give one example.  The largest donor from Ireland who gave between $10 million and $25 million is a guy named Dennis O'Brien.  He has the cell phone concession in Haiti.  When the earthquake happens, what happens?  He ends up getting USAID grant.  He participates in a $10 million grant for the development of mobile banking put together by USAID and the Gates Foundation. Then, he starts parting with USAID on education initiatives.  In all the news releases, the amount of money the federal government is putting in is spelled out, but never is it spelled out what's being put in by him.  And then, Bill Clinton personally intercedes and arranges for the construction of a $45 million luxury hotel owned by him, works it out with Marriott to build the hotel, goes to a World Bank affiliate to get the money, and presides over the dedication ceremony.  And he's the largest contributor from Ireland.  WALLACE:  OK.  Let's switch to, because there was another revolution this week about Clinton and emails.  And that's the fact that the FBI had apparently uncovered almost 15,000 new ones that we didn't know about either from this supposedly wiped clean server or from other people's e-mail accounts.  And because of lawsuits, there's going to be a steady release of these emails between now, right through Election Day.George, how big a deal is that?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  Well, it's a big deal and it demonstrates redundantly what a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive.  I mean, she has just been, all along, her judgment, it appears worse and worse.Second, because this is all tangled with the foundation, this really illustrates the Clinton's graspiness, that's a word the Washington Post used in an editorial 15 years ago when the Clintons absconded with some of the White House furniture.  So, we've done down this path before.  The question is, is this a big deal electorally?  I've got my doubts.  I'm not sure how many people have made their minds already and remain to be persuaded.  Voting begins in this country on September 23rd.  So, it's coming up on us and fast, North, South Dakota, and I think Minnesota.  The five of us are peculiar people.  We're really interested in all the details of this.  Thirty percent of Americans could name their two senators.  A majority of Americans can't name the three branches of government.  They're not paying that much attention.  WALLACE:  Well, I want to pick up on that because that's what we asked you for questions, but and that was the political impact of these new revelations about the emails.  And you had a lot of answers.  Craig Coldren sent this on Facebook, ""Does anything matter when her supporters don't care?""  And I love this one, Bill Smith sent this on Twitter, ""If you want me to tweet about this, donate to the Bill foundation, 10 percent administration fee, and pay my wife to make a speech.""Susan, this has been going on, whether it's the private emails, whether it's the Clinton Foundation, at least since March of 2015.  And I guess the question is, if people -- if a voter hasn't been turned off already -- and obviously she has a lead in the polls -- are these new revelations going to turn them off and make them change their mind?  SUSAN PAGE, USA TODAY:  I think the election is partly baked but it's not entirely.  There's some still swing in the election.  We have a Morning Consult poll this morning that shows only a 3 percent lead for Hillary Clinton.  That's pretty close.It does reinforce the worst impression that voters have about her, that she always pushes the edge of the envelope.  I think there's not any clear evidence so far of something that was criminal.  It's not even unusual.  It is pretty politically unsavory.  And I actually think it reinforces not only questions about honesty and trustworthiness, but the idea that she is a creature of the status quo in a year when Americans are really hungry for change.  WALLACE:  And does the fact -- I mean, we were talking about this -- does the coziness of the relationship, the fact that she met with 85 people, the fact that there are dozens of -- the fact that it seems that Doug Band, who is one of the top Clinton Foundation officials and also a personal aide to Bill Clinton, is just back and forth all the time, sending notes to Cheryl Mills and Human Abedin with various asks.  PAGE:  Pretty cozy, pretty predictable.  I mean, these were concerns that were raised at the point she was being confirmed as secretary of state.  And what is surprising I think perhaps quite surprising is she didn't do more to address this way in which Washington works.  You ask any elected official if they take a call from a big donor or willing to meet with a big donor, and they'll say, yes, but it is entirely -- you could entirely have predicted that she would be in this place, in this presidential election if she proceeded the way she did.  WALLACE:  All right, panel, we have to take a break here, but we'll see you a little later.  Up next, the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee, Governor Gary Johnson, who's at almost 10 percent in the polls and says he's going to play a big role in November.  Plus, what do you think -- does Johnson have a shot at swinging the election?  Let me know on Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and use the #fns.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, is Donald Trump softening his stance on his signature issue?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.  There certainly could be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday group how a possible change will sit with hard-line conservatives.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: A look outside the beltway at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico as the National Park Service celebrates 100 years.Well, he's the former Republican governor of New Mexico, and now the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee, who says he has a path to victory in this election. Joining us now, Gary Johnson.Governor, welcome to ""Fox News Sunday.""GARY JOHNSON, LIBERTARIAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Chris, thanks.WALLACE:  Your campaign manager says you have a two-part strategy to win the White House. The first part is that you have to get on that stage for the presidential debates starting September 26th. In the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, you're at 8 percent. So you -- and you need to reach 15 percent to get on the stage. Would you agree that if you don't get into the debates, it's game over?JOHNSON: Winning the election. Yes, I would say game over winning the election. But the Presidential Debate Commission has identified five polls. We're at 10 percent flat on those five polls. And that's an increase really of probably about 4 percent consensus over the last six or seven weeks. So we're optimistic that we're going to actually get into the debates. We're spending money right now in many states. In five states right now, I'm at 16 percent. So I'm just really optimistic.WALLACE:  OK. So now you get on the debate stage and now this brings us to phase two, which is, as I understand it, is to keep both Clinton and Trump from reaching the majority of 270 electoral votes to be elected president. Throw the race into the House of Representatives, where you say that you could win and, in that case, each state gets one vote, that you could win on a second ballot. How does that happen?JOHNSON: Well, the object is to win outright. And it's not impossible that if we go into the presidential debates with the polarization of Clinton and Trump that we might actually run the table on all this. And I'm talking about me and Bill Weld, two former Republican governors re-elected in heavily Democrat states. So --WALLACE:  Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts.JOHNSON: Yes. I don't think there's any arguing that we did make differences in our state being fiscally conservative, socially inclusive. I'll add to that, that we're really skeptical about intervening militarily to achieve regime change that I think has resulted in a less-safe world. So I think that we represent about 60 percent of Americans with that philosophical belief.WALLACE:  So let -- let's get into that, because you say the key to your candidacy is if people sit down and compare you to Clinton and Trump on the issues, they're going to pick you.JOHNSON: Yes. Yes. Yes.WALLACE:  So let's do a lightning round.JOHNSON: Ys.WALLACE:  Quick answers. Quick questions on a variety of issues.International trade.JOHNSON: Free trade. Supporting IPP. It's a good thing. Free trade. The -- more jobs.WALLACE:  The -- the TPP?JOHNSON: The TPP.WALLACE:  The Pacific trade deal.JOHNSON: Yes. Yes. We're the only ones that support it.WALLACE:  Immigration.JOHNSON: Make it as easy as possible to come into this country and work. To be able to get a work visa. A work visa should entail a background check and a Social Security card. Don't build a wall across the border. These are hard-working individuals that are taking jobs that U.S. citizens don't want.WALLACE:  What about the 11 million people -- and that's just an -- an arbitrary number -- but the millions of people who are already in this country illegally?JOHNSON: Complete -- complete misunderstanding of why they're here in the first place. The reason they're here in the first place is you cannot get a work visa to come into this country and work. And they're hard work, cream of the crop when it comes to workers. So you or I in that same position where jobs exist in the United States that U.S. citizens don't want, you or I would be crossing illegally to take those jobs just like they are doing.WALLACE:  So would you give them amnesty?JOHNSON: I would set up a -- I would set up where they could come in the door, get a work visa, as long as they've been law abiding. With regard to citizenship, there needs to be a pathway to citizenship. Look, with regard to those that are in the country that are undocumented, they're not going to jump the line. But that's part of comprehensive immigration reform that Bill Weld and I think we can bring Democrats and Republicans to the table over.Look, Hillary or Clinton -- isn't the polarization in Congress going to be greater than ever? Does anybody believe that anything is going to get better in Congress? Our pitch is the third alternative, which is a couple of libertarians in the middle, hiring a bipartisan administration. Everybody libertarian leaning. But I think you could make a case that that third scenario might work.WALLACE:  I want to drill down on a couple of issues. You want to cut spending by 20 percent you say and --JOHNSON: Which is balancing the federal budget, yes.WALLACE:  And you call for eliminating these departments -- the IRS, Commerce, Education, the FDA, DEA, drug enforcement, and the National Security Agency. Governor, you --JOHNSON: Actually -- actually, the ones that I'm citing -- and -- and, by the way, we're getting --WALLACE:  But all those are on your website.JOHNSON: Well, not on my website. You might read that in some other website. But, look, we're not getting elected dictator here or king. We're getting elected president, vice president. So there --WALLACE:  But you don't think any of those agencies do any good?JOHNSON: Well, in the case of Education, in the case of Commerce, and there are some vital functions in these agencies, but do they require an entire agency? I don't think so. But Education, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Homeland Security. Why -- why is Homeland Security an agency unto itself? Shouldn't it be a part of the FBI? Those are the ones that I am advocating out of the chute.WALLACE:  Then there are taxes. You want to eliminate the federal income tax. You want to eliminate the federal corporate tax and replace them with a consumption tax, a national sales tax. Experts on both sides of the aisle say that this would be highly regressive. That rich folks are going to make out like bandits and it's going to end up hitting the poor and the middle class.JOHNSON: Well, of course we're not getting elected dictator or king, president --WALLACE:  I know, but that -- but that --JOHNSON: Well, no, but -- but in that -- in that --WALLACE:  But what you're saying there, governor, is that we have --JOHNSON: Wait -- wait, in that -- in that --WALLACE:  My final -- don't take my -- let me just make -- but you're saying, when you say we're not going to be elected dictator, you're saying, don't take my policies seriously because they won't get through.JOHNSON: Take them very seriously, but count on certainty that we're going to always support taxes going lower. We're going to always support being in business being easier. Rules and regulations not getting worse, getting better.That said, if I could wave a magic wand, I would eliminate income tax, corporate tax. I would replace it with one federal consumption tax. I put up the fair tax as the template for how you accomplish one federal consumption tax. You're right about a consumption tax being regressive. The way that the fair tax deals with that is it issues everyone a prebate (ph) check of $200 a month that allows everyone to pay the consumption tax up to the point of the poverty level.WALLACE:  But the -- the --JOHNSON: I maintain that if we had --WALLACE:  But if I --JOHNSON: Zero corporate tax, which you and I paid for, I maintain that that would create tens of millions of jobs and that it would also issue pink slips to 80 percent of Washington lobbyists --WALLACE:  But, governor, the result of that, again, the experts say is, OK, even if you have the prebate, OK, now that helps the poor, but the rich are still going to make out because there's no tax on their income, there's no tax on their --JOHNSON: Well, believe me --WALLACE:  Let me just finish. There's no tax on their savings. So now you're hitting the middle class. They're going to pay more.JOHNSON: Well, I -- I'm going to argue that the more money you make, the more money you consume, the more tax you're going to pay. This is a proposal. The fair tax is a proposal that has been before Congress for about ten years. Every year, 80 Congress men and women sign on to it. So it's been pretty well vetted out there.WALLACE:  OK. I want to switch to foreign policy. You say you are a non-interventionist. You say that the threat from radical Islam is, quote, ""overblown."" You don't want boots on the ground. You say that air strikes either from planes or from drones have, quote, ""unintended consequences."" So the question is, what's your plan to stop ISIS?JOHNSON: Well, I do believe that if you want to look at ISIS, that they are regionally contained. Think of them as sands through an hourglass. We're going to see those sands through the hourglass.There was a poll a couple of weeks ago --WALLACE:  Well -- well, wait a minute. I mean what happens to the attack in Belgium? What happened with the attack in San Bernardino? What about the attacks in France?JOHNSON: These -- we -- we can -- we can call these -- we can call these ISIS-inspired attacks. Do they come directly, geographically from ISIS and the machine (ph)?WALLACE:  Well, in the case of France, they seem to, yes.JOHNSON: Well, Chris, a poll among active military personnel two weeks ago, who do they favor for president of the United States? Me. So what are they saying? What are -- what they're saying is judicious use of the military. If we're attacked, we're going to attack back. But the fact that we involve ourselves in regime change has resulted in the unintended consequence of making things worse, not better, and nobody's standing up to this. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, not intentional. They go in. They support the opposition in Libya and Syria. The oppositions aligned with ISIS. We arm the opposition. Now those arms are in ISIS' hands. This is the unintended consequence of our foreign policy.WALLACE:  So basically we're going to contain ISIS? We're not going to eradicate it?JOHNSON: Well, if we eradicate it -- and -- and, hey, you know, not that we're going to -- we're going to continue to stay engaged in that, but there will be a void when that gets eliminated. We didn't even hear about ISIS until two years ago. This was al Qaeda until it became ISIS. And wipe out ISIS and it will be something else. Look, the biggest threat in the world right now is North Korea. We need to deal with the civil war in Syria. That's joining hands with Russia diplomatically to see that through. Biggest threat in the world, North Korea. We need to join arms -- join hands with China to deal with that diplomatic.WALLACE:  Got one more question for you. We've got less than a minute left. Until January, you were the CEO of something called Cannabis Sativa, which is, I guess I pronounced that correctly, it's a marijuana marketing company. Question, of all the things in the world you could be involved with, why sell pot?JOHNSON: Well, in this case, marijuana products, which directly compete with legal prescription drugs on the medical front, don't kill anybody. Not one documented death, and yet these drugs do -- marijuana/cannabis -- does compete, does provide that relief. So it seems to me that there needs to be research and development in this area that can't currently happen because marijuana is listed as a class one narcotic. As president of the United States, I would delist marijuana as a class one narcotic. This is going to be an issue that is left up to the states, just like alcohol. And then on the recreational side of this, Chris, I have always believed that legalizing marijuana will lead to less overall substance abuse because it's so much safer than everything else that's out this, starting with alcohol.WALLACE:  Governor Johnson, thank you.JOHNSON: Chris, thank you.WALLACE:  Thanks for coming in.JOHNSON: You know how crazy this election cycle is. I might be the next president. You know that, right?WALLACE:  Well, and --JOHNSON: That's why I'm on.WALLACE:  I hope you'll give me your first interview in the White House!JOHNSON: There we go. There we go.WALLACE:  Safe travels on the campaign trail, sir.JOHNSON: Hey, thank you very much. Appreciate the opportunity to be here.WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring back our Sunday group to discuss Donald Trump's move to broaden his base and his change in rhetoric on deportation.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I've had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me and they've said, Mr. Trump, I love you. But to take a person that's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and the family out, it's so tough, Mr. Trump. I mean I've had -- I have it all the time. It's a very, very hard things.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Donald Trump opening the door this week to possibly moving more to the center on immigration policy.And we're back now with the panel.Karl, it's been fascinating to watch Trump this week on this issue. First he said there was a softening. Then by the end of the week he said there's a hardening. Is his opening the door to possibly softening on the idea of deporting all 11 million people in this country illegally, is that good politics?ROVE: Well, it's good general election politics. But also, this is not the first time he did it. You know, there's a -- there's a continual confusion about where he is on this issue. But I remind you, last year he said, I'm going to build the wall. And then he said, I'm going to build the wall and we're going to put a big, beautiful door in it so that they can come back, leaving the impression that all you had to do was to was to do what's called touchback.WALLACE:  Right.ROVE: This is Senator Kay Hutchinson's proposal in 2006 and '07. You know, if you're here illegally, you've got to go back and touchback.So this is not the first time he's brought this up. But, look, we've got confusion. Is he -- does he want to deport people or not? Does he want to have a touchback or not? And does he have -- form -- support some form of legal status for these individuals? My suggestion is, is that he is better off getting a position, clarifying it, and sticking with. I would prefer, I think for the general election, that he, quote, ""soften."" That is to say return to his position of last fall to say, people who are -- who've been here for a long time, kept their nose clean, raised their families, paid their taxes, you know, are employed, they have -- have some path to a legal status. It will be -- they will contrast to what Jeb Bush and say that sort of sounds like where Jeb Bush was. But, frankly, that's where he sort of was last year and was again there temporarily this week.WALLACE:  Susan, let me pick up on that with you, because there are two aspects of this. One is the fact that he's been having this debate in public and you have the Hannity town hall, you had the interview with Anderson Cooper. He is seen -- it's been a moving target. Is that the right way to handle this, or as Karl suggested, he just come up with a -- a position and stick to it? And is this about actually trying to win Hispanic votes, or is this about trying to get that white Republican moderate suburban woman who is worried that he's a racist?PAGE: No, 72 days before the election, he is debating with himself about his stance on the signature issue that launched his campaign. I think that's quite extraordinary. It raises concerns among his core supporters who are worried he's moving away from the hard line that was appealing to them initially. And I think it's less than persuasive to the voters he's reaching out to.I spent yesterday in the Philadelphia suburbs talking to white suburban reporters who are very much in flux in this election and they are quite concerned about whether Donald Trump is intolerant and they are unpersuaded by this public debate that's been going on for a week or so.WALLACE:  So he's getting the both -- the worst of both worlds?PAGE: That's right. He's not persuading the people in the middle that he need to get back. And it seems to me he is raising concerns among people on the -- on the right who think that a hard line on immigration is the most powerful position he has taken, and the one that got them to support him in the first place.WALLACE:  Then we had Trump reaching out to African-American voters saying -- asking them, what do you have to lose after decades of Democratic neglect. And then he said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Juan, we -- we had this remarkable moment in my interview with Kellyanne Conway where I -- I presented to her the fact that Donald Trump -- and he's been 14 months into this campaign -- has not held a single event in an American inner city devoted to a largely African-American community. The campaign is talking about, now they're going to start going into the inner city. Dr. Ben Carson is going to be -- his escort, if you will, into -- into those parts of America. How's that going to play?WILLIAMS: I don't think it has any chance. It's a -- but, again, to come back to something Susan said, this is not about the black community. I don't think it's about the Latino community. I think it's about trying to consolidate the Republican base, especially college-educated, white Republicans, and specifically women, who don't want to be associated with a racially charged campaign. I mean when you look at the numbers, this week I saw numbers saying 35 percent of all Americans, all Americans think Trump is a racist, 56 percent think that he's biased against minorities and women. And if you go into the Republicans, it's something like 20 percent of Republican men think Trump is a biased person and a quarter of Republican women. That's a problem.So right now, Chris, he's getting about 1 percent in the latest Fox poll, 1 percent support among black voters. He's down 46 percent among Latino voters. So there's almost no chance that he's going to make substantial inroads in that vote.WALLACE:  Then there was Hillary Clinton's attack on Trump this week, saying that he is taking mainstream -- or making mainstream hate movements like the alt right white nationalist movement. Her campaign even ran a video that showed -- and here it is on the screen -- members of the Ku Klux Klan supporting Trump.George, do you think that's a -- that attack has traction?WILL: I don't think so, nor should it. There are about 320 million people in this country and a few of them are lunatics and/or vicious. And the alt right is probably both largely. But that doesn't mean they're taking over one of our great parties. They're attaching themselves as a barnacle to a ship and they're not defining the ship.We've seen this movie before. In 1964, the John Birch Society had about 100,000 members. And it was used to tar the Goldwater campaign. The Birch Society was run by a man named Welch who said that Dwight Eisenhower was an agent of the communist conspiracy. It's not fair to define Donald Trump by David Duke of the Ku Klux Klan any more than it would be fair to define Hillary Clinton by some of her supporters who I guarantee you believe the United States connived at 9/11. There are nuts on both sides of this sundae.WILLIAMS: But, George, when you see Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, say that Donald Trump has engaged in textbook racism in his -- what he had to say about Judge Curiel, unable to be a judge because of his Mexican heritage, I think that's a little bit noxious.ROVE: Yes, but this week --WALLACE:  You've got 15 seconds, Karl.ROVE: This week, in -- in -- at a fundraiser, Cher stood up and said, Donald Trump reminds her of Adolf Hitler, Stalin, is a racist, insane and -- and a lunatic. And Hillary Clinton said, we're so excited that Cher is with us tonight.WALLACE:  Well, she always was a Cher fan.We've got to go. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" America's golden girl on her future in and out of the pool.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  We've been following Katie Ledecky for two years now after her upset victory at the London Olympic, as she geared up for 2016. Like all of you, we celebrated her victories in Rio. And we were delighted to catch up with her the other day to discuss all she's accomplished and what's next. Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)KATIE LEDECKY, OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL SWIMMER: It's pretty sweet. I've been smiling a lot. My cheeks are hurting.WALLACE (voice-over): It's good to be Katie Ledecky these days. Since the Olympics, she's made a triumphant return to Washington, she got Bryce Harper to hold her medals why she threw out the first pitch at a Nationals game, met with young patients at Children's Hospital and went back to her former school to meet with students.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What is Michael Phelps like?LEDECKY: He's nice. He's a good swimmer.I love answering those questions. I love sharing those moments with them. And hopefully inspire them to dream big.WALLACE:  What makes it especially sweet is Katie can look back on the Olympics with a sense of total fulfillment.LEDECKY: I achieved all my goals in Rio and that's the best feeling any swimmer, any athlete I think can have.WALLACE:  Katie set those goals three years ago. She was swimming a 3:59 for the 400-meter freestyle. She went 3:56 in Rio. She was swimming 8:11 for the 800. She went 8:04 and broke her own world record.LEDECKY: When we set those goals, those were pretty out there.WALLACE:  And so Katie had Michael Phelps teaching her how to arrange her five medals for a cover shoot.MICHAEL PHELPS, OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL SWIMMER: I put them on one by one, then tuck them behind.WALLACE:  Katie brought her medals with her. Each one means years and years of hard work.WALLACE (on camera): Is the silver the stepchild?LEDECKY: No! I mean, it's -- it's just as special as the others. We broke the American record and we got silver to the Australian team that broke the world record. So we couldn't -- couldn't have done any better that day.WALLACE (voice-over): We first met Katie two years ago when she was 17 after a shocking victory at the London Olympics.LEDECKY: Numbers don't -- don't like and they don't -- they show what you do in practice. And I like that aspect of it.WALLACE:  Now, 19, and one of the headliners of Rio, she's grown up.WALLACE (on camera): For someone as goal-oriented as you, what's it like when you have met all your goals?LEDECKY: It's a good feeling and it's been, you know, now a week or a week and a half since -- since the Olympics, and I haven't been in the pool and I'm starting to -- to itch to get back in -- in and --WALLACE:  Are you serious?LEDECKY: Yes.WALLACE (voice-over): While Katie had a great Olympics, teammate Ryan Lochte created an international incident with his false report of being robbed. What's the lesson?LEDECKY: Just take care of business in the pool, I think. Just -- what we do in the pool is -- is important, and also how we represent ourselves outside of the water, as well.WALLACE:  Katie is getting ready to start college at Stanford, to begin her next chapter as a student athlete. But the call of the Olympics is still there.LEDECKY: Hopefully I'll make it to 2020, and I know I'll -- I'll have some goals for that and looking forward to representing my country again.WALLACE (on camera): Can you think you can go even lower?LEDECKY: We'll see. I have a little bit of a cushion maybe, but I know -- I know the world will start catching up, and I'll have to, you know, stay at the level I'm at or get faster.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Katie was the youngest swimmer of the U.S. swim team, which is why she talks about competing in the 2024 Olympic at the ripe old age of 27.And that's it for today.

Tonight, with just nine weeks to go before the general election, Donald Trump is now surging in new national polls. In a CNN/ORC poll out today, Trump is now leading Hillary Clinton 45-43 in a four-way race among likely voters. And according to the same poll -- look at this -- Trump has a commanding lead among independent voters, topping Clinton 49 percent to 29 percent in a four-way race.And the latest Fox News poll shows a very close race, Clinton and Trump in a dead heat in a four-candidate contest, with Clinton's small lead now falling within the margin of error.Now, here's what's interesting. When it comes to key swing states, a Reuters poll now shows Trump leading or in a tie, for example, in Iowa. Trump is beating Clinton 44-41. Maine -- when has a Republican competed in Maine last? Trump and Clinton are tied 42 percent.There's a very close race going on in Michigan. Donald Trump is leading 42 to 41. In New Hampshire, Trump is up 45-44. And over to Ohio, the -- no Republican has won the White House without the Buckeye State. Trump is up 46 to 43.Look at this. The state of Wisconsin is all tied up. Trump and Clinton both have 38 percent. And with the polls now showing this race tightening, Donald Trump is campaigning very hard. By the way, if anyone is low energy, it's not Jeb Bush. It's Hillary Clinton.Look at Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: My opponent wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees over the large number...(BOOS)TRUMP: ... over the large number that are already coming into the country through -- thousands and thousands through President Obama. She is running to be America's Angela Merkel, and you see what happened to Angela Merkel of Germany! They had a massive defeat recently in the elections because Germany has had problems like it's rarely seen before.And look at France, and look at other countries. It's catastrophic, folks. It's catastrophic. I have friends that go to France every year. They love it. I say, How did you like it this year? They say, We don't go to France anymore. France isn't France. Pretty tough. We'll go to North Carolina instead, OK?(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I think so.I'm also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs and many, many more little goodies if they continue to refuse to take back the criminals that have been placed in our country!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Here now with reaction, former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. All right, these polls are very reassuring. We got -- you're smiling. That's never a good sign. We got a lot of game left to play, but certainly in the last three-and-a-half weeks, things have changed.I would argue he's on message. He's only comparing his record, the failing record of Obama and Clinton versus his vision for the country, and I think his outreach in Baton Rouge, to the Mexican president, to this church in Detroit has served him very well. Thoughts.NEWT GINGRICH, R, FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think, first of all, if you're Trump, you have to feel pretty good at the tremendous comeback from the week after the Democratic convention, when the polls were terrible, people were writing him off, et cetera.You look at a place like Wisconsin, where they're now tied. That means that Ron Johnson's reelection campaign for the U.S. Senate has a big boost. You look at Ohio, where he's now ahead. That means that Rob Portman's reelection to the Senate has a big boost. You look at Iowa, where Chuck Grassley is going to get reelected.But this is all coming together in a positive way. Remember, you have 63 days. My prediction -- and I've been on this theme for a while. My prediction is that it will get better for Trump. It will get worse for Clinton.And to the degree that Trump stays focused on two things, sticking with the teleprompter, which he does as well as anybody I've ever seen, and he's making his points, and he's coming across very, very effectively. And second, continuing to do things that are bold.It was bold to go to Louisiana while Hillary Clinton stayed hidden in Long Island raising money. It was bold to take the Mexican president's invitation and then to look equally presidential in that press conference. I mean, anybody looking at that could say Donald Trump clearly can be president, while Hillary Clinton stayed hidden in Long Island raising money. It was bold to go to Detroit.And by the way, it was very bold to go to Youngstown, Ohio. The largest county fair in Ohio is in Youngstown. Youngstown is historically -- Mahoning County's a very Democratic base originally. He had huge crowds. He and Mike Pence were there together. They had huge crowds in Youngstown. If Trump carries eastern Ohio by the margins that are building, he's going to carry the state.And there's a wonderful cross-Trump, to use a phrase from Bridge, between Rob, who's really doing a great job, Rob Portman, from Cincinnati, carrying the suburban areas, and Trump carrying the Ohio River Valley. If they mutually reinforce each other, Ohio could get to be a very good state.HANNITY: You know, it's amazing how immigration and the issue of refugees-- it's always peace and prosperity that drive elections. It's big here. I showed on the air last week that Hillary Clinton has flip-flopped on driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. On building the wall she's flip- flopped. On sanctuary cities, she's flip-flopped. On welfare and health care benefits -- she's flipped and flailed all over this.Watch this. You were there. You're in this video in 1995. Listen to Bill Clinton talking about immigration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use imposes burdens on our taxpayers.That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Kind of sounded a lot like Donald Trump, don't you think?(LAUGHTER)GINGRICH: Yes, I have to give -- really, this was a remarkable moment. I had actually forgotten that line. That was the very first State of the Union that I was part of. And I saw Dr. Ben Carson on TV Sunday, and he referred to that. And we pulled that section. And I thought to myself, this is the Clinton/Trump plan, and we should ask Hillary Clinton how she feels about Bill Clinton's plan because it is remarkably like Trump.And by the way, today I saw a six-minute local news report from San Diego on illegal immigration into San Diego this last week. It is so startling, it's unbelievable.HANNITY: We'll play this again tomorrow, but I've got Hillary flipping and flopping and flailing like, you know, John Kerry -- I voted for $87 billion before I voted against it -- on everything involving immigration.Let me go to this other issue. You and I have discussed at length for years the need for the Republican Party to reach out, in particular to the black community, where under Obama, there's been a 58 percent increase of black Americans on food stamps, millions more black Americans now are out of the labor force, and in poverty, a 20 percent increase, black Americans not participating in the labor force.Jesse Jackson -- they ran this ad about Trump and the KKK and the Confederate flag, but this is what Jesse Jackson said about Trump. Does this help Trump?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REV. JESSE JACKSON, RAINBOW/PUSH COALITION: I do want to express thanks to you, Donald Trump, for being with us tonight. We need your building skills, your gusto, your rent package for people on Wall Street to represent diversity, and we thank you for coming tonight. Let's give Donald Trump a big hand.In terms of reaching out and being inclusive, he's done that, too, and created for many people a comfort zone. When I ran for the presidency in '84 and '88, he came to our business meeting here in New York because he has this sense of the curious and a will to risk to make things better.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: 1999. I've been to Trump Tower. I see the people, the diversity of people that work there. I think that kind of takes the sting out of that phony race-baiting ad that Hillary's campaign is using.GINGRICH: I think the Trump campaign would be well served to take that clip, put it on every black radio station in the country, and say, Who are you going to believe, you know, Jesse Jackson or Hillary Clinton?And you're exactly right. By the way, Jackson refers back to meetings with Trump in the '80s, when Jackson was running for president. He said, Trump came to my business meetings because he was openly curious about what was going on.So this idea that the speech in Detroit is a sudden, you know, last-minute event -- Donald Trump has been concerned about solving America's problems for his entire business career, talked about it in the '80s, got the cover of Time magazine in '89 because he was more than just a businessman. He's tried to figure out how to help the country and...HANNITY: Well, let me ask this.GINGRICH: Go ahead.HANNITY: All right, Clinton aides -- 327 times, they didn't remember information about the private e-mail server -- 327 times! Hillary couldn't remember 40. One of the excuses she made is, Well, I didn't know if I was briefed because -- and we'll get into this later -- because I had a concussion in 2012.Now, I want to say that in light of -- here's the media on her plane, and these are the questions the media -- the real tough questions they've been asking her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D, PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Welcome to our big plane! It's so exciting.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you think?CLINTON: I think it's pretty cool, don't you? You're supposed to say yes.(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: I am so happy to have all of you with me.QUESTION: Have you missed us?CLINTON: I was just waiting for this moment.QUESTION: How was your Labor Day weekend?CLINTON: It was good. It was really good. Yes, we had a good time. The last moment of -- happy Labor Day, I know. It's exactly right.QUESTION: Do you have a Labor Day message?CLINTON: Oh, I do. You'll hear it.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: I definitely -- I definitely do.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: So she can't remember. She says her concussion caused her to forget all of these horrible things about her. And I'm thinking, You can't come up with a better question than that, or the pay-to-play scandal and the Clinton Foundation?GINGRICH: Well, but you're asking the elite media to be other than who they are. They are essentially the offensive wing of the Democratic Party. They're totally connected to the Democrats. They're desperately hoping that she'll win, and they're willing to cover up for her every way they can.The problem they've got is that her problems are so big that they keep leaking through, despite the best efforts of the elite media, and the country week by week learns more about how dishonest and corrupt Hillary is.Again, think about this. I mean, if you're Donald Trump and you're preparing for a debate and you're going to face a person who cannot remember 46 times and White House lies routinely, how do you prepare to debate that?(LAUGHTER)GINGRICH: I mean, you know, the moderator is going to ask her something, and she's going to say, Well, you know, I don't quite remember. And then she wants us to believe she's ready for the 2:00 in the morning phone call.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: All right. I got it. You're on your ""A"" game. Welcome back. I know you were on vacation. Thanks for being with us.GINGRICH: Good to be with you.HANNITY: And up next tonight right here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Every time I think about Trump, I get allergic!(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Hillary -- yet another coughing fit, four minutes, 22 seconds, and she finally took a couple of questions from the press, but they were all softballs. Herman Cain, Laura Ingraham weigh in next.And then later, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He said he's going to be releasing significant information about Hillary Clinton that will derail her campaign. Well, he'll be here to tell us what may happen next. That and more.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Every time I think about Trump, I get allergic!(LAUGHTER AND CHEERS)CLINTON: Boy, we have 63 days to go.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, Hillary Clinton having one of her frequent coughing fits. I think this went on 4 minutes and 22 seconds at a rally in Cleveland, Ohio, yesterday. But that was not an isolated incident. She had another coughing fit, an attack while speaking with reporters on her campaign plane. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: So -- you got some water?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'll be all right (INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Earlier today, the Drudge Report ran a headline highlighting Clinton's recent history of coughing fits. By the way, we're just going to keep in the corner of the screen just -- we kind of put them all together. Just take a look.Does it raise questions about her health, especially in light of the revelation she told the FBI that, well, she couldn't remember a lot of things because she had a concussion in 2012. Well, I thought it was a conspiracy, according to CNN, if you bring up the idea about Hillary's health.Here with our discussion, editor-in-chief, Lifezette.com, nationally syndicated radio host Laura Ingraham. Also FOX News contributor, a nationally syndicated host himself, Herman -- we're all talk show hosts here.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: But you can watch Hillary. She has these coughing fits one after another after another. Then we find out she uses as an excuse, Laura, the fact that she had a concussion, why she couldn't remember if she was briefed or not as it relates to how to secure e-mails. So do we now have a right to inquire a little bit more deeply about what the situation is with her health?LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. As a former white collar litigator, I would say that Hillary Clinton opened the door to questions about her health.Sean, when she claims that she doesn't remember basic elements of her duty as secretary of state, she doesn't remember certain briefings, she doesn't remember the designation on the top of a document for classified information -- she didn't remember that she had more than one device? I mean, none of this passes the straight face test.HANNITY: She had 14 of them.INGRAHAM: We know that.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: All right, so here's what we know, Herman. She couldn't recall all the security briefings. She couldn't recall 40 times. She couldn't recall the receipt of the security briefings because she had a concussion. How do you forget the whole briefing, and does it raise questions?Her aide destroyed her Blackberries with a hammer. Her e-mail was targeted multiple times by hackers because once she clicked on a porn link, and she also claimed that the ""C"" marking, which everybody knows is ""classified,"" was referencing paragraphs in alphabetical order.Now, her aides also said 327 times they didn't remember. She said it 40 times. Do you believe any of this, or is she just lying? And by the way, she's coughing in the corner there. Go ahead.HERMAN CAIN, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Sean, she's just lying. I mean it's one thing -- this shows that her staff is pushing her out there despite her physical condition. She needs to get medical help. It's one thing to have one coughing spell, but to continue to have multiple coughing spells, and they get longer and longer and longer -- her staff is not being sensitive to the fact that maybe she needs to step back.They don't want to do that because it might continue to add to a lot of the rhetoric and a lot of the perception that maybe she's not healthy enough to do this.The other thing is all of these other things that she has denied she's able to remember -- her biggest problem is not coughing. Her biggest problem is lack of integrity, and it's starting to show through with a lot of people, period.HANNITY: All right, 277 days, Laura, no press conference. Her events -- they're often, like, 100 people, and it's for the TV cameras, and they never pan back to show that there's no crowd there.Now, you're a lawyer. Is it not evidence of acting intentionally and with a criminal intent? She didn't -- she was asked by Ed Henry, You mean with a cloth, when she was asked if she wiped her server clean. No, she used expensive BleachBit software to make sure God couldn't read them, as Trey Gowdy said. So is that criminal intent? Do they need to reopen this investigation?INGRAHAM: I think they absolutely should reopen the investigation. They seem to have new information that wasn't brought to congressional attention earlier this year. The information alone about the Blackberry destruction -- how did Jim Comey not even sit in on the interview with Hillary Clinton? He didn't even take part of it.HANNITY: Oh, by the way, you mean the same guy that made a document dump last Friday, when everybody's on vacation, the way campaigns do? That guy?INGRAHAM: Oh, of course. Let me -- let me just -- can I say just one thing about the FBI? This is supposed to be an agency, Sean, even in our hyperpolitical world, that calls balls and strikes fairly. They're an umpire. They're not on one side or the other. We should be able to trust the FBI to do the proper investigation and come to the proper conclusion without regard to political allegiance or political party.We know that one of the independent investigators at the Justice Department actually gave money to the Obama campaign both in 2008 and 2012. This, I think, hurts the integrity of the FBI...HANNITY: I agree with you.CLINTON: ... and again, eats away at the public's trust in government. None of us could get away with smashing potential state's evidence with a hammer.HANNITY: Oh, good luck to you, Laura Ingraham. I'd like to see you bash up your phones with -- and your computers. All right, last word, Herman.CAIN: Well, Laura is exactly right. Unfortunately, the integrity of the FBI has been compromised by this administration and the Justice Department. That's unfortunate because people have often, for a long time, had a lot of trust in the FBI.They have now compromised their integrity because it is apparent and it's clear that they are trying to hold back and cover for Hillary Clinton, which, in fact, she has shown that she cannot be trusted. She does not recognize the integrity of classified information, and she is definitely not trustworthy.HANNITY: All right, guys, we got to continue this. We'll have you back later in the week. Thank you both for being with us.When we come back, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says that he has, quote, ""significant documents"" that could impact Hillary's campaign. Assange is getting ready to release them, and he'll be here to talk about that next.Also later, on Friday, the FBI released their report on Clinton's private server. The document dump came on a holiday weekend. Larry Elder, Doug Schoen they'll weigh in on that and more on this busy news night tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So in a recent interview with The New York Times, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange had some harsh words for Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS: The American liberal press, are falling over themselves to defend Hillary Clinton, are erecting a demon that is going to put nooses around everyone's necks, assuming she wins the election, which she is almost certainly going to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, he was not mincing words there, but that's not all. In other interviews, Assange has said that he has, quote, ""significant documents"" that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign.Here to join us and explain more, the man himself, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Julian, how are you, sir? Welcome to the program.ASSANGE: Good day, Sean. I'm well as can be expected for being detained for six-and-a-half years without charges.HANNITY: You know what? I understand -- you know, part of me in the beginning was conflicted about you, and I'll tell you why. I believe in privacy. I believe that people, especially when it comes to private e- mails, personal e-mails, et cetera and -- I think people have a right to that privacy.On the other hand, you have done a lot of good in what you have exposed about how corrupt, dishonest and phony our government is, and I applaud that. I think that's good that we know that.Do you understand people when they talk to you about the privacy issue?ASSANGE: I -- I do. And we have exposed a lot of governments, and WikiLeaks has -- you know, we specialize in bringing the First Amendment to the world. We're always very surprised that one of our biggest battles would be trying to bring it to the United States under an Obama administration.HANNITY: Yes, that's interesting you say that. Why do you say that that's a surprise to you?ASSANGE: Well, because if you see the rhetoric coming out of the Democrats, it's that they're pro-civil liberties, and an important part of civil liberties is respect for the First Amendment and the rule of law. And that has broken down under the Obama administration, and Hillary Clinton was part of that process.She has and the Obama administration has attempted to prosecute more journalists and journalistic sources under the Espionage Act, that same Espionage Act that she was being investigated under, than all previous presidencies combined.HANNITY: Yes.ASSANGE: Not just more than any one of them, more than all of them combined. So there's -- under Obama, an epidemic has developed of abusing national security laws to crack down on what is legitimate use of the First Amendment.HANNITY: You said to PBS that you have a significant amount of information. The information itself is significant pertaining to Hillary Clinton's campaign. You will be releasing it in several batches as you are finishing it from a journalistic standpoint. How many batches, as you describe them, do you think you'll be releasing, and how soon?ASSANGE: A tricky question, Sean.HANNITY: No, that's actually a pretty simple one. That's not tricky.ASSANGE: The first batch is reasonably soon. We're quite confident about it now. We might put out some teasers as -- I don't want to promise anything because you have to see how the formatting goes. But we might put out some teasers as early as the next week or the week after.HANNITY: Last question. It's not really hard to hack into these even secure systems, is it? I've talked to some real smart computer friends of mine. They say it's far more simple than anybody would ever know. Is that true?ASSANGE: It is. I just want to say one thing. In the FBI report released Friday, I agree with your analysis. It is very strange that that was released Friday afternoon on a labor weekend. I do think it draws questions to what sort of game the FBI is trying to play.But Hillary Clinton says that she can't remember what a 'C' in brackets stands for. Everyone in positions of government and in WikiLeaks knows it stands for classified, confidential. And in fact we have already released thousands of cables by Hillary Clinton -- here she is, Clinton -- see, that's her signature, Clinton with a 'C' in brackets right there.HANNITY: Wow.ASSANGE: Thousands where she, herself, has used a ""c"" in brackets and signed it off, and more than 22,000 times that she has received cables from others with this ""c"" in brackets. So it's absolutely incredible for Clinton to lie. She is lying about not knowing what that is. But it's a bit disturbing that James Comey goes along with that game.HANNITY: Wow. Julian Assange, fascinating. I do hope you get free one day. I wish you the best. Thank you for being with us.ASSANGE: Thank you, Sean.HANNITY: All right, We'll have part two of that interview coming up tomorrow.Now, the FBI did a huge document dump on Friday, releasing its report on the investigation of Clinton's e-mail server. Larry Elder, Doug Schoen weigh in next.Plus tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, Donald Trump spoke to members of an African-American church this weekend. His outreach to the black community continues. We'll play highlights, get reaction from the Reverend Darrell Scott and Sheriff David Clarke as we continue tonight right here on HANNITY.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. So on Friday the FBI decided to dump documents on its investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private e- mail server, and what was made public is absolutely stunning. Again, they did this before a holiday weekend.Now, according to the FBI report, Clinton used 13 mobile devices for e- mail, and none of them could be recovered by the FBI. Why? Because some of them were destroyed by an aide of hers that used a hammer on them. Now, members of her staff deleted e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena. Now, Clinton didn't know that the letter ""c"" marking on documents meant that it was classified. She blamed her 2012 concussion for not being able to recall security briefings. And Clinton also told the FBI that she couldn't recall or didn't remember specific details nearly 40 times. And the list of what she couldn't recall includes, quote, ""when she first received her security clearance at the State Department, receiving classified training, using her power to classify documents, who had access to her e-mails, and receiving e-mails that should not have been on an unclassified system.""Now, the timing of the release by the FBI and its director, James Comey, is so stunning that even members of the mainstream media are questioning if it was done to protect the Clinton campaign. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK HALPERIN, MANAGING EDITOR OF BLOOMBERG POLITICS: There's so much to say about the FBI's conduct here. Those who are skeptical about how he's done this, look at the Friday release. The guy has not had a press conference. He talks about transparency. I've become increasingly critical of him. I know he's got a sterling reputation.JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: Not anymore with me.HALPERIN: To release this on a Friday as if he's an arm of the Clinton campaign, I'm just stunned, because there's a lot of information in here that's of great public interest. And if you really cared about transparency, you would say to yourself, is the best time to release this to get a full public hearing on Friday before Labor Day? No.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: A very good point. And according to former federal prosecutor Rudy Giuliani, he says the report proves that Clinton is lying and broke the law.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUDY GIULIANI, R, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: I think she is doing something called lying, which violates 18 United States code, section --(CROSSTALK)GIULIANI: That is what Martha Stewart went to jail for, for one lie, for a couple of years, one lie about a financial matter that had nothing to do with our national security.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Here with reaction, Salem Radio nationally syndicated host Larry Elder, FOX News contributor, former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen. So doesn't that show that she acted intentionally, the campaign, her people acted intentionally and with criminal intent when you use BleachBit? Ed Henry asked her did you wipe the server clean, and she goes, ""you mean like with a cloth?"" No, they used BleachBit. BleachBit is designed to make sure, as Trey Gowdy said, God can't find those e-mails. So isn't that obstruction? Doesn't that get to the heart of intent?DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: As a trained lawyer, I've learned not to make judgments about cases I've not been in. But, Sean, it looks pretty darn close to me, and I say this as a Clinton supporter. All I can say is Mr. Comey, I think, has a lot more questions to answer for his behavior. I agree with Mark Halperin.HANNITY: Clinton aides, 327 times, Larry Elder, they couldn't recall the details. And, by the way, the Hannity conspiracy about her health, it appears I was way ahead of the curve considering she is citing her concussion for not being able to recall. I'd like to know what else she doesn't recall. Does she know what happened on 9/11? Does she recall the Sunday after 9/11? She was profiling Muslim Americans, you know, just a few little details she might have forgotten.LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYNDICATED HOST: Her top surrogate, of course, is Governor Tim Kaine, her running mate, and he did not hold up very well under persistent but fair questioning by Martha Raddatz over at ABC.The arguments are three. James Comey did not make a criminal referral. And, by the way, she apologized. She made a mistake. Oh, and Donald Trump has not turned over his tax returns. The problem with James Comey not making a criminal referral is that most Americans believe that he should have made one. Even Colin Kaepernick said that if it had been anybody other than Hillary, she would have been in prison.And the other argument about her being sorry when Dick Cheney was alleged to have outed a covert agent, critics didn't say he made a mistake. Critics said he jeopardized national security. She has jeopardized national security.And regarding Donald Trump not being transparent, it's called a non sequitur. It's called a dodge. She's not been transparent. She said she turned over all of her relevant e-mail. We find out now that she did not turn over all of her relevant e-mail. She did send and receive classified information. She did send and receive --HANNITY: Here's my question, though.ELDER: -- that was marked as such. This is awful. And it undermines if not completely offsets her number one argument against Donald Trump, the strongest argument against Donald Trump, which is he's too dangerous to be --HANNITY: If she remembered losing the memory of the briefings she apparently was supposed to take or did take, what else does she remember not remembering? I'd like to know the answer to that question.SCHOEN: I think that answer is there is no answer to that question. Larry's silence --HANNITY: Whatever is convenient?SCHOEN: Look, Secretary Clinton got through this. This is politics. She is going to hit Donald Trump very, very hard because, as we've said, Sean, there is not much of an argument that she's made or at this point can be made for her candidacy. She's going to hit hard. She's going to focus on --HANNITY: So the only way she could be win is to be negative against Trump. She can't run on her record. She can't run on honesty. She can't run on vision. She's got nothing but negativity. That's what you're saying?SCHOEN: That is what she's going to do.HANNITY: That's all she can do.SCHOEN: I think at this point she could articulate a vision. She won't. But she's going to stay negative, unrelenting, a billion, billion and a half dollars-worth of communication. That's just a fact.HANNITY: Larry, I don't disagree with Doug because that's all she's got. It's pretty pathetic that so many people support her.ELDER: Doug has always been sane and rational, has never hit below the belt. And what else does she have? She can't talk about economic growth because there hasn't been economic growth. And she can't talk about anything than Donald Trump is reckless. He's racist. He's a homophobe. He's a xenophobe, because that's all she's got.And what's happened? Donald Trump's poll numbers are going to rise in the black community, as I predicted to you a long time ago, between 10 percent and 15 percent, and she cannot win. Donald Trump is going to be the next president of the United States because the strongest argument against Donald Trump is that he's reckless. He's irresponsible. He can't be trusted. And Hillary has now offset that strongest argument. She's in very, very serious trouble.HANNITY: I agree with you, but I agree with Doug inasmuch as this is not done yet. A lot of game to play.SCHOEN: Very close race. Very close race.ELDER: Three debates.HANNITY: Up next tonight right here on HANNITY.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump's outreach to the black community continues as he traveled to Detroit this holiday weekend. He spoke to members of an African-American church. We're going to play you highlights. We'll get reaction. He got a standing O. The Reverend Darrell Scott is here. Sheriff David Clarke will join us as well, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. So on Saturday Donald Trump traveled to Detroit where he continued to reach out to black American voters. This time he gave a heartfelt speech to members of an African-American church. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation.Today I just want to let you know that I am here to listen to you, and I've been doing that. I believe we need a civil rights agenda for our time, one that ensures the rights to a great education, so important, and the right to live in safety and in peace.I fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right.It is my prayer that America of tomorrow, and I mean that, that the America of tomorrow with be one of unity, togetherness, and peace. And perhaps we can add the word, ""prosperity,"" OK, prosperity.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And joining us now with reaction, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, and the CEO for the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, he was in the audience, the Reverend Darrell Scott.Reverend Scott, two things that stood out in my mind. When Al Gore would go before predominantly black audiences, he would go into like -- he would change his pitch, his tone, his cadence, his delivery, and try and be a black preacher. Hillary did the same thing. I played it many times. I think that is so condescending.And I saw Donald Trump speak to people as he does everybody, with a little bit of reverence for being in a church. I give him credit for that. But he keeps reaching out to the black community and pointing out what I have been pointing out. Black Americans, P. Diddy even said it, they got shortchanged by Obama's promises. They're not better off. A 58 percent increase in the Obama years, black Americans now getting food stamps, a 20 percent increase black Americans out of the labor force. They've been disproportionately impacted, and Donald Trump keeps making this outreach. Will it pay dividends for him?REV. DARRELL SCOTT, NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP: I think it will. Donald Trump is saying things that need to be said but politicians don't like him saying, especially if you're with the incumbent administration because any disparities or disenfranchisement on behalf or on the part of black Americans reflects negatively on the current administration. It's been eight years and this current administration, and this is where it has gotten us. That's why I don't take offense to him saying what do you have to lose, because we've lost just about everything. We don't have anything else left to lose.HANNITY: Sheriff, what is your take? I actually think this is one of the best speeches he gave. I liked the way he delivered it. I liked the fact that he was there. I like Republicans fighting back this false, defamatory narrative that if you're conservative you don't care about minorities. I've always resented that false accusation.SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY: This has been nothing short of splendid. It even surprised me. And what I mean by that is I thought there would be little lag time before we saw some results, but it seems to be happening. And I'm not talking about a huge shift, but black people just want to be talked to. What I got out of that whole speech, and I listened to it, I like the tone in which he talked to us, too. He talked to us like we're adults. He didn't talk to us like we're a bunch of infants, and he didn't show up in this very clumsy way like Mrs. Bill Clinton does with a bottle of hot sauce in her purse and eating a plate of watermelon and thinking that is cool.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Am I allowed to laugh at this? Do you guys notice, Al Gore goes into a black church and he goes into that preacher mode? ""And the glory of the Lord."" And Hillary Clinton, ""I ain't feeling in no way tired."" What is that? What are they doing? What the hell is that?CLARKE: The other thing I liked, Sean, is that he's right. We need a new civil rights agenda. The civil rights agenda of the 21st century for the Democrats has been to mainstream criminal behavior and more rights for criminals. But Donald was very clear -- Mr. Trump, I'm sorry, with all due respect. Better schools for their kids, meaningful work, adequate housing, things like that are what the black community needs. The problem with the Democrats right now Sean is that they can't look and extoll the virtues of living in the ghetto because that could end this. But they can't say to black people, look around. Isn't this great? That's the problem for them right now. They're going to have to spend a lot more resources on this than they anticipated going into the final 60 days.HANNITY: All right, guys, thank you both.SCOTT: Thanks, man, god bless you.HANNITY: You, too. God bless you.Coming up next, a very important ""Question of the Day."" We need your help. That's straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. And it's time for our ""Question of the Day."" So what do you think about some of the press's softball questions to Hillary that we showed you tonight?

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Back with Governor Jeb Bush from the beautiful Reagan Presidential Library. This time we're talking immigration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: Is immigration part of our national security?JEB BUSH, 2016 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Sure it is, protecting the homeland is part of our national security.VAN SUSTEREN: And you get criticized even within your own party for your views on immigration.BUSH: Yeah. I think we should secure the border for national security purposes, for public health purposes, for the rule of law purposes. I've written a book about it. It's not like this is not new to me.VAN SUSTEREN: They say amnesty when they say Governor Jeb Bush.BUSH: Yeah. So if you say, for example -- my view is that we create a path to earn legal status where you pay a fine, you work, you pay taxes, you don't get federal government assistance. And over an extended period of time, you earn legal status, you don't earn citizenship. That's not amnesty. Amnesty is what we did in 1987. The alternative to that is self- deportation or rounding everybody up. The cost of that, according to the American Action Network, a conservative think tank, is something like $400 to $600 billion over 20 years. That doesn't sound like a conservative idea to me.VAN SUSTEREN: If you're the nominee, how will you describe Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's foreign policy?BUSH: I would say that it's -- if you want a third term of Barack Obama's, you're going to get it because she was there when all of this took place. And, you know, you can take loyalty up to a certain amount but she was there making these decisions. She pushed that reset button with Russia and it didn't work out. She was responsible for the Libyan policy that was an abject failure. She along with President Obama could have signed the forces agreement between Iraq and the United States that would have created stability and not allowed ISIS to exist. She was -- she was there with the red line in Syria that created such problems for the United States around the world. This presidency has failed in terms of its foreign policy and she will -- she will -- this is her -- what she's touting, that she has the experience of being Secretary of State.VAN SUSTEREN: What's President Obama -- if she's -- if she gets President Obama's foreign policy, how do you describe his foreign policy?BUSH: My foreign policy?VAN SUSTEREN: No, President Obama's.BUSH: I've just described it. It's one of vacillation, it's one of grandiose words with little to back it up, it's one where the military and the intelligence capabilities of this country have been gutted, and it's one that believes that American leadership is not a force for good in the world. And that is out of the mainstream of American thinking. We need to restore the bipartisan consensus that American leadership is essential to create a more peaceful world. In the post World War II era that has what has kept the world from falling apart, and American leadership continues to be indispensable in that regard.VAN SUSTEREN: How do you get the people of Iowa interested in foreign policy? In the new poll that came out, it's still Donald Trump winning post debate in Iowa. How do you get attention?BUSH: Look, it's the long haul. I'm in this -- I tell people I'm the tortoise in the race.VAN SUSTEREN: I thought you said your brother called you that?BUSH: Because he read it that I said it and he wants to give me a nickname so he gave me the nickname that he knew that I would like.VAN SUSTEREN: You like that one?BUSH: I like it. I think you have to have the long view, slow, steady progress. We have a plan to get to the finish line as the winner in a way that will allow me to take on Hillary Clinton. Greta, the reason why you see the Clinton campaign and Hillary herself, Mrs. Clinton herself attacking me on a regular basis is they don't want me to win the nomination because they know I'll take it to them and that I'll campaign in a way that will bring people towards our party that long ago abandoned us. We've got to broaden out the party and I think I can do that.VAN SUSTEREN: You know its interesting listening to you because I know that your families are close too. I know that your father and Bill Clinton are close. Yet people say in politics, they say unbelievable things about each other.BUSH: Look, there's a former presidents club I'm not part of. I don't know the secret handshake so I can't speak to that. But I'm going to run hard and I'm going to run to win. I'm going to do it honorably. I don't think we need to be spending all the time tearing down someone, personalizing it. We've lived with this for far too long. Hillary Clinton is wrong about the issues. Her foreign policy is not the right one for this country. I have no -- I'm not ascribing bad motives for it, I just think she's wrong on the issues and I'm going to take it to her for it.VAN SUSTEREN: Governor, nice talking to you. Thank you, sir.BUSH: Thanks, Greta.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: And you can check out behind-the-scenes from our interview with Governor Jeb Bush, just go to my Facebook page. Plus you'll actually see more of my interview with Governor Bush later this week right here ""On the Record."""
