This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is once again making headlines after announcing that she is becoming the newest member of our team here at Fox. And I sat down with her to talk about that and much more.Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And Governor Palin, welcome to the Fox News Channel.SARAH PALIN, FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR: Thank you so much.HANNITY: I guess we're colleagues now.PALIN: We're teammates. Here we go.HANNITY: Welcome aboard.PALIN: Thank you.HANNITY: Really appreciate for you to be here.* Watch part 1 | Part 2 | Part 3So I want to ask you, as this year unfolds we're going to invite you on the program, and we're following I think one of the biggest midterm elections that we've ever had in the country. What are your general big picture thoughts about this election year?PALIN: I think there's such a disconnect from those on Capitol Hill with the voters today. And we're going to see some evidence of that with the upcoming elections, with these midterms.I think we're going to see a shift in the Massachusetts race that's coming up here shortly. A bit over a week. Win, lose or draw, the conservative candidate running there, I think it's going to send a very strong message that this status quo, even in Massachusetts, the status quo of just accepting the big growth of government and health care takeover measures that it seems Capitol Hill wants to cram down our throats today. Things are going to start changing. Thank God things are going to start changing.HANNITY: What a political earthquake, though, that would be.PALIN: Yes. Right.HANNITY: You know, if -- look, first of all, New Jersey was a big win.PALIN: Right. Virginia, big.HANNITY: Virginia.PALIN: But, even -- and I would love to be able to at some point interview Senator Brown. I anticipate victory there. But even if he doesn't win, already, poll numbers showing that his message is resonating. And his message is common sense conservative values, principles, solutions being plugged in to meet the challenges facing America today.People in his state, they are listening to him. And they're getting excited this dynamic candidate.HANNITY: You have been having a big impact on these races. For example, Doug Hoffman in the New York 23rd. What are your plans for this year? I know you got speeches and I know you're traveling a little bit. Are you planning to get out on the campaign trail and go out there and stump for candidates?PALIN: I sure will. I will. Those who understand the need for our country to become energy independent, to allow security -- national security and economic security via energy independence -- those who get it, I'm going to be out there working for their cause.HANNITY: When you say those that get it, that's interesting to me. Because it was interesting how conservatives stood up and supported Doug Hoffman while the establishment candidate, Dede Scozzafava, you know what? They said no.Will you pick and choose -- even if somebody is picked by the establishment if there's a more conservative candidate, more in sync with your values, are you going to be willing to step out every time and go for the conservative?PALIN: I sure will. I don't hesitate to do that. I've never hesitated to kind of -- bucking the trend or the tide.HANNITY: Going rogue?PALIN: Going rogue, yes, in order to not just go with the flow and do what maybe some head honchos want, because they're not always right.The people of America, though, their voice is growing louder and louder when they're saying no to government takeover of our health care system to allowing 1/6 of our economy in the private sector to be shoved into the government's hands.An issue like that, no. People are saying whether the establishment likes it or not, the people don't like it and a representative form of government demands that it is literally a representative hearing the voice of the people and implementing what their will is.HANNITY: I don't think I've ever seen -- and everywhere I go, and I'm sure -- you just came off a pretty big book tour, and congratulations, the number one book of 2009.PALIN: Thank you.HANNITY: I've never seen people this energized.PALIN: Yes.HANNITY: That a conservative -- I don't think I've ever seen a moment like this and I've been, you know, on the radio -- I hate to age myself here -- since 1986 and since we began here on the Fox News Channel in '96.Does that translate, do you think -- is there any obstacle you see that gets in the way of what we predict is going to be a pretty big year?PALIN: The nice thing about this energy that you can fill, you can fill with these campaigns and talk about new dynamic candidates being willing to put themselves out on the line and run for office to serve us.It's independents, too. Independents are saying we want common sense solutions in there. We don't want government growth. We don't want to incur such debt that is, to me, immoral, it's irresponsible. We are handing it to our children and our grandchildren to pay bills for us, for our desires today.It's the independents, too, saying, no, we need to shift gears here. We need to get away from what the Obama administration is doing to us.HANNITY: Did you see -- the AOL, the sign on to AOL -- I don't know if you're an AOL subscriber -- has an article about you saying you coming here to Fox may disappoint many of your fans. Because they say, well, maybe they will interpret that as a signal you're not going to run in 2008. That --PALIN: Well, first.HANNITY: I'm sorry, 2012.PALIN: First, you know, I said forever what would America do without Fox News? This is where you will get fair and balanced reporting and analysis of the issues that are so important to all of us.But, you know, I'm not going to close any doors for my future, for my family's future, don't know what's in the future or what it holds but -- between now and whenever some big decision has to be made I'm going to do all that I can to help our country get back on the right track and that's to get a message out there about solutions that I believe in and a whole lot of Americans believe need to be plugged in.HANNITY: See, I agree. Michael Steele was on this program when he launched his book. And, you know, I thought this was a good take that he had and I think this is good for your personal life.If things are going wrong in your personal like, you got to take stock of yourself. You got to become introspective and you got to say, all right, where am I making mistakes? And so he said the Republican Party had made mistakes. And then he was criticized for admitting that.I think that's the first step towards becoming a better party or a better person. Your thoughts?PALIN: And I say after Michael Steele's comments the other night, I was like right on, more power to you, Michael. You're calling it the way that you see it and you deserve to call it that way.And basically, of course, his message was buck up or stay in the truck, critics. If you don't want to help out, if you don't want to help the cause of getting these common sense solutions to all these challenges facing us, then, you know, go find something else to do.But don't just sit there throwing stones and this internal inside baseball infighting in the Republican Party. I e-mailed Michael Steele, too.HANNITY: You did.PALIN: I said 99 percent of Americans they don't know who these people are, the establishment, and they couldn't care less.HANNITY: I think you're right.PALIN: About what's going on internally.HANNITY: See, because I've been a critic of the Republicans. I saw what was happening in 2006. And I saw problems leading into 2008. I think the Republican Party, this is -- I think they abandoned some of their core values.What do you think some of the mistakes were that they should admit to so that they can move on?PALIN: Definitely, some of the Republicans on Capitol Hill have abandoned the core values that have to do with shrinking government, not growing government. That's a very simple thing.Sean, you know, the Democrat Party, too, though, has abandoned so many of the good Democrats out there. That's what they're telling me. They're saying, wow, we feel kind of lost right now because the Democrat Party today in power has gone so far left, taking these steps towards -- some would characterize it as heading towards socialism.Yes, that those steps that they are taking, there are many, many, many Democrats disappointed in that party machinery, too. That's why in Alaska, 70 percent of Alaskans are independent. That they don't want to be a part of a political machine that allows partisanship to get in the way of just doing what is right.HANNITY: Right.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And coming up, so what if Sarah Palin got a call from President Obama? What would she say to him? You'll find out right after the break.Plus Sarah Palin reveals plans for her very own Fox News show. That is straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And we continue now with more of my interview with former Alaska governor and the newest member of the Fox News family, Sarah Palin.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Is it too early to think about 2012 for other people maybe that you're looking at, that you think, all right, that person may have -- have what it takes to be a leader? Anybody you see on the horizon.PALIN: That there are.HANNITY: Excluding yourself.PALIN: There are so many out there who are quite bold, who are also not allowing the partisanship within the machine of the party to get in the way of having their voice heard on some of the solutions that we need to see.Those who understand, as I pointed out, the need for energy independence who wants a strong military presence so that we can have a peaceful existence here. We've only had peace through strength.And all those other principles that certainly in the GOP, the points on our platform build there are so many. But I do think it's still quite early.HANNITY: Would this be the platform -- be the party of national security. You don't negotiate without preconditions with Holocaust deniers, the party of fiscal integrity, balanced budgets, eliminate earmarks, the party of energy independence, I know you'd support that. Free market solutions for health care and education. Is it that simple?PALIN: It is that simple.HANNITY: It is that simple.PALIN: It is that simple. The establishment, the politicos, they want to complicate things. They want to confuse the electorate so that people feel at some point that they need to sort of back off and not be so involved any more.Now we're trying to bring a message back to that simplicity, back to the planks and a strong platform that can build a stronger America. And the tea party movement that they're trying to keep it simple, too, and let people know that no, here are the things that have worked in the past.History has proven that free market principles being applied will allow the private sector to grow and prime and prosper and our families to keep more so that they can prioritize their earnings much better than government can.People within that tea party movement, they get it. Their voices are being heard.HANNITY: Let me ask you. Is there a chance, is there any fear, because they actually polled -- the tea party movement polls higher than the Republicans in a poll.Do you worry that they may split or divide the conservative vote in the country or do you think in the end they come together and do you have a fear or message to those that may think about splintering off?PALIN: That's a great question. Because heaven forbid that there be that splinter. I think at the end of the day we have the same message, and that is -- those points that you have just made, about strong military, about free market enterprise being able to drive our economy, not government growth driving our economy.Government getting out bailout, businesses, getting out of the private sector and out of our lives. Those within the tea party, I believe, agree with so many in the Republican Party and a lot of Democrats too believe in that, too.HANNITY: Who? I don't see moderate Democrats, who?PALIN: There are some good ones. In the heartland, especially.HANNITY: In the heartland. Not in Washington.PALIN: No, not so much in the establishment, absolutely. But heaven forbid that they become the factions, though, and fractions within, say, the tea party movement and there become the infighting within that movement and then that prohibits the progress that this movement can make.HANNITY: What do you think of this controversy with Harry Reid? It wasn't just what he said but then Bill Clinton made the comment apparently to Ted Kennedy, you know, a few years ago Barack Obama would be getting us coffee.What did you think when you heard about that?PALIN: Tough to defend those statements. And that type of thinking that is quite foreign to so many of us who would not judge someone -- have any kind of criteria based on skin tone.HANNITY: What would the reaction be if Sarah Palin said that?PALIN: Or Sean Hannity. Absolutely. You get clobbered if you say such a thing.HANNITY: Clobbered. Probably be even fired.PALIN: Well.HANNITY: Or there'd be calls for me to be fired.PALIN: This double standard, this hypocrisy is what drives the rest of us crazy. Remember Trent Lott said what he said? He got run out of town. Here, Harry Reid says what he says, and I don't believe that either person, a Trent Lott or Harry Reid, are racist, I don't.I believe that they picked the wrong words in trying to make a point there. But look at double standard applied. It's OK for Harry Reid to say such a thing according to the liberals but it wasn't OK for Trent Lott and others?HANNITY: Should the same thing happen then to Harry Reid? In other words.PALIN: Well, should he step down?HANNITY: Should he step down?PALIN: Well, I think he should step down anyway because I think he is driving a bus that is headed towards a train wreck that is going to happen in America if we continue down this road that he, and Pelosi and Obama want us to be on, a road that is allowing this government growth and is hesitant to really bolster our national security. That road that they want to put us on, it scares me and it scares a lot of Americans.HANNITY: Now the president always says that he -- and I agree with you. The president always says that he would want to hear from other voices and other people. If the president ever reached out to you to get an opinion what would you want to tell him right off the bat about either national security or the economy? Would you -- what would you say to him?PALIN: I would definitely go to the national security issues. I know that jobs are the number one issue in our country. That is what is on voter's minds. People want to know how are we going to get out of this 10 percent unemployment rate and the 17.3 percent underemployment rate. This is horrible.And I think enough people are already telling Barack Obama come on, you got to do something different here. You got to quit growing government and assuming that government is the solution to the economic woes in this country.People are already taking care of that. I'd like to talk to him about the national security issues, though, and what I believe the rules of war should be. And I would like to recommend to him that he show a little bit more passion in this War on Terror so that we can trust that perhaps the steps that he takes that seems to be so hesitant, to make decisions when it comes to our national security, that we can at least trust that he's really being deliberate -- he isn't purposefully hesitating and dithering and being kind of wishy-washy on things when the rest of us want to see action taken so we can get this war on terror won. We can get it over with.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And coming up, Governor Palin on the president's broken promises and the type of people she'd like to profile if she had her own TV show. Straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Now we continue now with more of my interview with former Alaska governor and Fox News contributor Sarah Palin.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: How worried are you about the economy? A lot of people out of work, they're not even counting millions of people any more in their new data system.PALIN: Right.HANNITY: The president promised that the stimulus, you know, unemployment wouldn't go above 8 percent. How afraid are you about the situation involved in the economy?PALIN: And now we are hearing about China's emergence, their economic emergence and other countries, too.HANNITY: China, by the way, the largest automaker in the world.PALIN: See? And here we're stalled because we're disincentivizing manufacturing, we're disincentivizing production and the job creation that we need to see and now -- in order to allow our economy to where we need to cut the taxes on the job creators of small businesses. We need to allow families to keep more of what they're earning.Instead, Sean, where we're going to go and I think that this will be revealed here shortly in this new year. We're going to see revealed the tax increases that were promised not to happen.But I guarantee they will happened. Otherwise, how the heck are we going to pay for these multi-trillion dollar plans of the White House?HANNITY: How insane is it that you would be better off to die this year because you'd pay no estate taxes? But if you die next year they're going to take half of whatever you made in your lifetime. How insane -- only Washington can come up with a cockamamie, you know, idea like that.PALIN: You know what an idea like that -- you have to ask yourself, bring it back down to simple terms. How does that create a job? How does that put food on the fable for someone? How is that going to help our economy?It's not. It's going to hurt. So you ask what I would say to the president if I had the opportunity. We talk national security and then we pivoted in to the economy, I'd ask him, do you really think that where we're going today with growing government and incurring this huge debt, this deficit spending, do you think that is helping?Because even if he doesn't believe us, the commentators, he just has to look at the numbers and see it's not working. So.HANNITY: No, they're digging in. They're talking stimulus two.PALIN: So let's humble ourselves and let's say, you know, we went down that path for a year. It isn't working. Let's shift gears. Let's go a different direction. And you know, I do want to hear more voices and I will actually hear from people who have other ideas, besides growing government as the idea.HANNITY: It seems like they're doubling down, though, if they're having going to have the son of stimulus, they're just doubling down on bad ideas which --PALIN: It's a horrible idea, the second stimulus when we have not measured the success of the first stimulus.HANNITY: Let me ask you. Did you watch all those health care hearings on C-SPAN?PALIN: I missed them. Gosh, when did they air?HANNITY: You've missed those?(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: What does it mean --PALIN: Me and every other American missed it.HANNITY: When George Herbert Walker Bush said read my lips, no new taxes, he paid a heavy political price.PALIN: He was held accountable for that.HANNITY: He was held accountable.PALIN: Right.HANNITY: Do you think Barack Obama saying eight times -- eight times -- during the campaign of which you are a part, you know, I'm going to put all these hearings on C-SPAN. And then he breaks that promise and every meeting is behind closed doors.And do you think he pays a political price for this?PALIN: And there hasn't been the bipartisan effort that had been promised.HANNITY: Zero.PALIN: I do, Sean, because the people of America are smart, they're intelligent, they're astute. They're paying attention now more than ever to what is going on. And I think that we're going to see that manifestation of their frustration. And they're paying attention to what's really going on in these midterm elections.HANNITY: Yes, I agree. Now one of the things, you're amazed at how the amount of impact your Facebook comments have had in the political discourse and debate, because every time you write something it goes out over the wires, you've noticed that?PALIN: Well, they're usually pretty simple messages that I'm posting there on Facebook.HANNITY: When you're talking about health care, you know, you said to those death panels which created a big controversy and you're adding new words to the American vocabulary here. You stand by those comments because you think it still exists in the bill?PALIN: I do. It's a commission. It's a bureaucracy. It's bureaucrats who will ration care if the bill goes through as Obama wants it to go through. Yes, it's modeled in essence after a British system that does have people to decide whether, based on your quality of life, your age, whether you're going to deserve health care coverage or not.That's what's going to happen in America if this health care bill isn't stopped. And it needs to be stopped soon and that's why the people of this land can't give up in demanding that their voice be heard.Demanding that the White House understand that this is a representative form of government. We do expect that the will of the people is listened to and adhered to and implemented via our representatives whom we elect.HANNITY: All right, so as you embark on your new career as a fellow Fox colleague, I read in the press release that you're going to be hosting shows and doing specials. What can we expect -- I would expect one that you might do. I'm guessing off the top of my head.PALIN: Well, here's what --HANNITY: Maybe one on energy independence?PALIN: Absolutely. Energy independence, what I would like to focus on for our children, I want to find real role models. I want to find those who should be our celebrities, those who we would be proud, Sean, for our children to be able to look up to and say I want to be like that person.That person who maybe would never be in a spotlight but they work hard to put food on the table for their family. They're selfless, they're helping others, they are compassionate. They have a strong, strong work ethic.I want to find those people across America. I want to profile them and I want to say kids, you can be like that person because this is America.HANNITY: So in other words, you would do profiles on great Americans that we never hear about every day?PALIN: Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, real, real American idols.(END VIDEOTAPE)-- Watch ""Hannity"" weeknights at 9 p.m. ET!Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE HUCKABEE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He ought to win, just by virtue of -- if you look at how much money, the resources, and everything, I mean, he ought to win. And that's what I'm saying: if we win, it would be a miracle.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, ""SPECIAL REPORT"" HOST: Well, I'm sure he didn't intend to low ball there. Mike Huckabee talking about Iowa where he and Mitt Romney are in a close race, one in which all the momentum in recent weeks, or virtually all of it, has been to Huckabee, with polls showing him ahead -- miracle, indeed.Some thoughts on this race now from Fred Barnes, Executive Editor of ""The Weekly Standard,"" Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, and Mort Kondracke, Executive Editor of ""Roll Call,"" FOX News contributors all.Let's look a couple of polls. These are national polls, and it is not at all clear how much they mean at this stage, but they will tell you something. First, the latest FOX News opinion dynamics poll shows that Rudy Giuliani is now at 20 percent. Back in November he was at 33.McCain is up a little from 17 to 19, Huckabee from 8 to 19 percent -- you can see where all of Giuliani's points went. Romney up a little, still at just at 11, and Fred Thompson has dropped a couple of points.That is, basically, the same trend shown in a similar poll from NBC news and The Wall Street Journal, where you can see that Giuliani and Romney are basically tied, Huckabee at 17, which is up quite a bit, McCain and Thompson where they are.But, Iowa, ABC/Washington Post poll out of Iowa -- this is the guy who says it would be a miracle if he wins. He is said to be at 35 percent, Romney trailing at 27. So, miracle, indeed.Mara, what do you sense is happening here?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: The guy is a good politician. It is always nice to set yourself up in case you win, it's a miracle. That's what he is doing.What is happening is that Huckabee has had this extraordinary rise. In the space of a couple of months he has gone from single digits to being the leader.And I think what has happened there a structural part of the vote in Iowa and it belongs to Christian conservatives. They took a very long time to settle on a candidate, and they finally settled on him -- estimates are up to about 40 percent of the Iowa Republican caucus vote.Now, I think that's what he is tapping into. That's what is responsible for his rise. A lot of people have tried to court them --HUME: Yes, he's at 35 percent. That's sounds about right.LIASSON: Yes. A lot of people have tried to court them, including mitt Romney, and it hasn't worked.Now, the thing to watch for is his rise is kind of organic. He doesn't have a lot of money to make to make an organization on the ground like mitt Romney does, who spent an estimated $7 million in Iowa alone on organization and on television advertising.So what we will find out on caucus night is whether this kind of organic movement, home-schoolers of evangelicals who are really excited for Huckabee turn out, or will Romney's what he calls ""super volunteers"" -- they're paid volunteers, and he has a big network of them -- will they do the trick for them?MORT KONDRACKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ""ROLL CALL"": And Huckabee is not only surging in Iowa, but he's now first in South Carolina as well, and he is second in even Florida and California. That's amazing.Whether it can last, who knows? But so far, there's been a lot of stuff thrown at Huckabee, especially by Romney, and he's going fast an furious on the immigration issue, on amnesty for prisoners and stuff, pardons and clemency, and stuff, and his tax record -- and it hasn't affected Huckabee yet.FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": I agree with that. You know, look, I haven't cut Huckabee much slack, but if he wins or even comes close, it is a miracle.HUME: In Iowa?BARNES: From where he came from? A month ago, he was nowheresville, and now he is leading Romney. That's a political miracle.HUME: You're talking about a miracle that's already occurred.BARNES: Yes.HUME: He's talking about a miracle that's about to occur.LIASSON: Yes, because -- (INAUDIBLE)BARNES: In any case, he's certainly -- look, he is rated -- if Romney beats him, he has certainly lowered expectations for Romney. If Romney wins, he will call it a miracle as well.But Huckabee is being hit pretty hard now, and I wouldn't expect it to affect the polls immediately. And just because there is some article on, you know, ""National Review Online"" or ""The Weekly Standard"" Web site that is critical of Huckabee, folks out in Iowa probably aren't reading that stuff. But they have heard Romney.And one thing is clear, Huckabee does not like to be criticized. He responds angrily, and he say ""Why is he doing that? It's wrong."" It's like it's unfair and your not allowed to do this in politics, attack the people who are running against you in an election.And he responds. He says he doesn't respond, but he does respond and criticizes Romney. The test will be if he runs ads attacking Romney. Certainly Romney has ads attacking him.KONDRACKE: The second thing that is important that has been happening is that Giuliani has been faltering. We have all said isn't it amazing that Giuliani continues to have a national lead in spite of social views, his personal life, Bernard Kerik.I think it is catching up with him, I really do.LIASSON: (INAUDIBLE)KONDRACKE: And the Bernard Kerik stuff. There has been a lot of -- Bernard Kerik got indicted --HUME: So you would suggest that there is a lead time from the day that the stuff begins to appear and builds to some kind of volume, and the time that it affects you.KONDRACKE: And if it seems to be validated over time. The story doesn't get knocked down, it doesn't go away. It keeps coming back and people keep talking about.HUME: How long can a guy in the person of Mike Huckabee, who clearly disagrees with the president of the United States and most of the Republican Party on foreign policy issues, who is clearly a man who has raised taxes with some regularity while governor of Arkansas, who is supported by the National Education Association, which is a bete noir of the Republicans, how long can a man like that remain on top of the polls?BARNES: They may not know what people are voting on. They may just be glad because he's a social conservative.The problem for Huckabee, though, is that most social conservatives are not just social conservatives. They tend to be economic conservatives and foreign policy conservatives as well.So I think it's quite possible for Romney or somebody else to cut into this Evangelical base that Huckabee has in Iowa. It doesn't seem to happen yet, but it might happen.HUME: There are polls from Rasmussen reports, and he polls with some regularity, that suggest that the Huckabee momentum, which was growing steadily, has at least slowed down or stopped. That doesn't mean he won't win, and it doesn't mean he isn't ahead. But, it means --LIASSON: But you have to look at the calendar. New Hampshire has less proportion of Evangelical. He can hop right to South Carolina where there is a fair amount of them. But on February 5 a lot of states with bigger parts of the population are not tailor made for him.HUME: Let's talk about that scenario for a second. There will be a tremendous big story about whoever wins Iowa.LIASSON: Right.HUME: Only a few days later we'll have New Hampshire. If he doesn't do well there, what happens to all that momentum? Will that carry over into New Hampshire or not?(CROSSTALK)KONDRACKE: He's got a strong base in South Carolina. Again, Christian conservatives are sustaining him in South Carolina. And wherever there is a large group of them, he will do OK.HUME: When we come back, the all stars will take a look at how the Democratic sweepstakes are shaping up. Don't go anywhere.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN HILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So you can ask the people of New York that when I tell you that I will help you, when I tell you I will fight for you, when I tell you I will give you my best effort, that's exactly what I do. That may sound hopelessly old fashioned, but that's who I am.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: I don't know if it was old fashioned or not, but, apparently, a lot of people believe that according to the new Fox News Democratic primary national poll, which shows that Hillary Clinton, who was thought to have been slipping, at least in early states, has been gaining in the national polls. She's up from 44 to 49.Barack Obama is thought to be down, and the same is true of John Edwards, at least marginally.So, if you look here at an ""ABC News/Washington Post"" poll on Iowa, you see Obama ahead by a few ticks. That's all margin of error stuff, we understand that.But look at Hillary Clinton on the question of favorable and unfavorable ratings. In November, she was rated favorably by 49 percent of the people. That's down to 45. And her unfavorables are at 49, and that's the highest of any candidate in the field.So kind of a mixed picture there for somebody who was so far ahead in the national polling.KONDRACKE: Well, she -- look, she has been playing the negative against Obama for a long time.She said the fun stuff was going to start, and the fun turned out to be a bunch of attacks on Obama's experience, on his drug use as a young man, on his allegedly being a Muslim -- somebody dribbled that out and it got a lot of circulation on the internet, and Bob Kerrey sort of mentioned it and then withdrew it. And it looked like --HUME: Bob Kerrey in the course of endorsing Hillary.KONDRACKE: And complimenting Obama ostensibly, saying he had gone to a secular madrassa -- HUME: A contradiction in terms.KONDRACKE: Exactly.In any event, it was unrelieved negativism on the part of the Clinton campaign. Some of it was on purpose, some of it maybe not on purpose, but, nonetheless, she gets the blowback from that.Now she is on the likability tour. And she has got all these friends of hers who have been friends of hers for life, and they're going around with her attesting to what a great person she is.HUME: She did every national morning show in America, all the networks plus all the cable channels one day this week. That's unusual for her.KONDRACKE: Three out of the four polls that have been conducted recently in Iowa indicate that she's in the lead. And all four of the last four polls that have been conducted in New Hampshire indicate she has a lead, and it is measured at about seven percent in New Hampshire.There is -- I'm told that every Monday morning there's a little poll that's conducted among the Hillary Clinton staff in Iowa, and the last poll among them indicated that they thought that Edwards was going to win. And, frankly, the Clinton people hope that Edwards wins if she doesn't, because if Edwards wins then Obama's momentum will be slowed.LIASSON: If she is number three? I don't think so. If she comes in third in Iowa, that will be a big setback for her. If she's second, that's different, and Obama third, of course I agree.BARNES: Was there a poll of the Edwards staff? Maybe a poll of the Obama staff? That's not a poll taken in American that I've heard of.Look, Hillary, I agree with everything you said, however. She's hurting. Sometimes it works, sometimes you have to do it. Sometimes you get blowback, and she is getting blowback.All these candidates have Christmas ads. I think you played a couple of days ago the one by Mike Huckabee, a very good ad. Hillary has one -- or I should say Senator Clinton has one -- and it shows her putting these things like ""alternative energy"" and ""troops coming home"" under the Christmas tree. It's pretty clumsy, I think.On the other hand, John Edwards has one talking about -- look, I'm not a John Edwards' fan -- but talking about not forgetting the poor and homeless and so on at this time of the year -- extremely good Christmas ad.LIASSON: Yes. I think what the Clinton campaign is worried about is a third place finish. I think they feel that she can withstand a second place finish if it's not too far back. She might even be able to call herself the comeback kid.HUME: Wait a minute, she is supposed to be ahead.LIASSON: In the ABC/Washington Post poll, but the point is -- HUME: The next thing you know she will be saying it will be a miracle if she wins.LIASSON: What's happening in Iowa, I think -- first of all, it's very, very hard to poll because it's hard to know who is going to show up to these caucuses. I think it's fair to say that it is a dead heat, even a three-way dead heat in Iowa. No poll has shown anyone ahead outside of the margin of error.BARNES: This likability thing is better if it comes naturally. Ronald Reagan was likable. Her husband, Bill Clinton, one of the most likable people in the world. You can fake it, but it's hard, and she's not doing a very good job.HUME: Well, so anybody got a forecast here? We're about to go into what presumably will be a lull here for the holidays.KONDRACKE: I think it is totally impossible to know who is going to win the Iowa caucuses on the Democratic side.HUME: Either party?KONDRACKE: I would say Huckabee looks like he will win on the Republican side.LIASSON: The interesting thing in the Republican race -- I think the movement in the national polls reflect something that is happening in the states. But in the Democratic race, the movement in the national polls: there is none. It's static. She is ahead, she has always been ahead. But she's slipped a lot.HUME: That's it for the panelContent and Programming Copyright 2007 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2007 Voxant, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: On night after being mistreat ed as a POW, a guard loosened the ropes binding me, easing my pain. By Christmas, that same guard approached me, and without saying a word, he drew a cross in the sand.We stood looking at the cross, remembering the true light of Christmas. I'll never forget that no matter where you are and no matter how difficult the circumstances, there will always be someone who will pick you up.You and your family have a blessed Christmas and happy holidays. I'm John McCain, and I approved this message.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ""SPECIAL REPORT"" GUEST CO-HOST: That's Senator John McCain's new ad, ""My Christmas story,"" just starting airing. Let's look at some of the polls in New Hampshire. The Real Clear Politics average of all the polls, you can see McCain is in second place there at 23.2, behind Mitt Romney, and he is obviously moving up in the polls.So let's talk about this surge for McCain. Some analytical observations about it from Fred Barnes, Executive Editor of ""The Weekly Standard,"" Mort Kondracke, Executive Editor of ""Roll Call, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, FOX News contributors all.Fred, it's undoubtable that if you look at all the polls that there is a surge.FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": You can tell, even if you go out with McCain, that there is a surge. You don't really need the polls. It's really palpable. I went out with him last week, and he's getting larger crowds, he's getting enormous interest.And I think the phenomena here is most people say well, the war is going better, he has been for the war, it is his strategy that is being applied in Iraq.I think there's something different than that. The guy who came close to identifying it was Joe Lieberman, the Democratic Senator, who endorsed him a few days ago, to the surprise of me, anyway. Maybe others had expected it, but he is somebody who knows and respects McCain.And he said McCain is no ordinary politician. And he's not. He's different. And we saw in that ad -- we know what he has gone through in serving his country in five plus years as a POW. We know what his character is.We know that he is withstood a test that no other candidate could even dream of, and, as a result, I think a lot of conservatives who are mad at McCain, as I am, for a lot of things like campaign finance reform and voting against the Bush tax cuts, and so on, are coming back to him as being the most solid candidate.BAIER: Mort, what about that ad, first of all?MORT KONDRAKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ROLL CALL: I think it was a great ad, and it had a religious overtone to it.BAIER: And there is no hiding the cross there. That's a cross.KONDRACKE: Exactly, and so it should remind religious candidates that there is another candidate in the options besides Huckabee.I have long been an adherent of the primogeniture theory of how the Republicans Party picks its nominees: the next oldest guy in line gets to be the king. And that was McCain. At the beginning of this campaign, it was McCain.And then the Party thought, well, you know, he's tired, old goods, and he was for immigration, and they were mad at him, as Fred says, and they went off and romanced with all these other candidates, and it just may be possible that they're going to come back and rediscover him as the character candidate.And, also, the polls indicate that that he is the Republican candidate best able to defeat any of the likely Democratic nominees.BAIER: Let's put that up. FOX News Opinion Dynamics Poll, a new one: against Hillary Clinton, there you see McCain at 47 percent, Clinton at 42. and that has changed since November.Charles, is this surge -- can he continue this not only in New Hampshire but other places?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, he needs New Hampshire to propel him, because he's really out of money, and he will need the free media he would get from the victory. He is actually climbing in at least one poll even in Iowa even, where he came out against ethanol.And that tells you a lot about the guy. What he has in authenticity. You come out against ethanol in Iowa, you are really is saying I will say whatever I believe.And that's why the surge and the success in Iraq and so forth, it is not just that he got it right with the policy and advocating a surge and a new strategy, it's that he was willing to go down with the ship, where he said all year long at a time when things were not improving earlier in the year, ""I would rather lose a campaign than have my country lose a war.""This is a man of stature as you see in that ad. That's why he gets the endorsement of ""The Boston Globe,"" of the ""De Moines Register"" liberal paper, a former Democratic candidate for the vice-presidency.He is a man who has appeal to independents and Democrats as a national figure, unlike any of the other Republican candidates.BAIER: Let's talk about Huckabee and this arrogant bunker mentality that was in this foreign policy paper and also in his speech. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was asked about that today. Take a quick listen to this sound byte.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CONDOLEEZZA RICE, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The idea that somehow this is a go it alone policy is just simply ludicrous. And one would only have to be not observing the facts, let me say that, to say that this is now a go it alone foreign policy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Mike Huckabee said that perhaps she didn't read the article. Then he said I don't remember whether I actually wrote the words ""arrogant bunker mentality."" It might have been somebody else, but I own them. So what about all of this?BARNES: Well, look, I didn't know he was trying to pass it of to some speech writer, or something. That is not a good sign for his campaign.The truth is he is wrong, and the problem is that he is ignorant of what is going on in American formal policy. Clearly the U.S. has not isolated itself in foreign policy and only doing things unilaterally. Just look at the six countries that are involved in North Korea and the European group with the Iranians, and so on. The fact is he was simply wrong.BAIER: More, quickly, is McCain the beneficiary of the people who may get iffy about voting for Huckabee?KONDRACKE: Well, he has certainly won. In Iowa, it would be Romney, presumably, but in New Hampshire, it would be McCain, I guess.KRAUTHAMMER: I would like a response to his response to Secretary Rice: ""She may not have read the words that I didn't write.""BAIER: That's the last word of this panel. When we come back, how is President Bush doing reigning in the three countries he called the ""Axis of Evil almost six years ago? Our panelists get their score cards out next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NO CAPTIONING)KRAUTHAMMER: People have the impression that Iraq is a debacle and Iran is OK after this intelligence report that it's not pursuing nukes, and we are dealing with North Korea.I think that conventional wisdom is completely wrong. Iraq is a success in the sense that Saddam and his sons are gone, that dynasty which would have been a threat to us and the region for a generation is gone. Iraq is on its way to, I think, success.Iran is a debacle, because after that intelligence report, which was misleading --BAIER: The National Intelligence Estimate.KRAUTHAMMER: -- which gave the impression that Iran has given up seeking nukes. It's actually only, perhaps, halted one element, the least important element of a nuclear program.But, because of that report, the administration has lost all leverage, is even going to have trouble with sanctions, and I think the Iranians are going to end up with a bomb in the next administration.And North Korea, it's a bit of a mixed picture. It's dismantling its plutonium reactor, but it is hiding the uranium program. And the real issue today is: is Pyongyang going to declare it and dismantle it, or is it going to hide it? And we don't know.BAIER: So you are saying one for three.KRAUTHAMMER: One for three that we know. The others are iffy and very dangerous.KONDRACKE: I agree with the bottom line, here. The question I would have is: suppose we had not invaded Iraq and concentrated heavy diplomacy on Iran. Iran is clearly long term more dangerous -- well, in the medium term, a more dangerous power than Iraq would have been. Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, did not have a nuclear program going. Iran was working and is working on a nuclear weapon.Now, if we had not gotten ourselves afoul of the whole wide world by invading Iraq and then making a botch of it for a very long time, would we have been able to unify everybody around pressure against Iran the way we have succeeded with North Korea?And we have done it very well. We've done it with multilateral diplomacy. And we have got inspectors in there now. We have got a lot of intelligence information. We don't have any intelligence information about Iran, because we have no diplomatic contact.BAIER: What do you say to the people who say that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program because of the Iraq military situation?KONDRACKE: And then started it up when it looked as though we were losing in Iraq. You can't rewrite the history, but it's worth questioning what would have happened if we had done it in reverse.KRAUTHAMMER: The question is ""No.""BARNES: Of course that's the answer.KRAUTHAMMER: It would not have stopped Iran.BARNES: We can't rewrite history -- of course, he just tried to right here in an attempt to take an entirely unfair swipe at the Bush foreign policy.But in any case, I would give him, Charles says one out of three, Mort seems to say that. I would say one-and-a-half out of three, actually, for the reasons that Charles said, because they have -- we have a nuclear reactor. We know it's been dismantled.There is a lot left to do. Probably one of the things is we know they have actually built nuclear weapons there in North Korea. They are supposed to turn those over. That is a mission that I think the U.S. is going to try to accomplish in 2008 -- good luck.KRAUTHAMMER: Mort, your assumption if we had not done Iraq the world would have loved us and would have joined in stopping Iran is completely pie in the sky. Unless you would have invaded, you wouldn't have stopped the program.BAIER: That's the last word, no response this time, Mort.Content and Programming Copyright 2007 FOX News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN HARRY REID, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, (D) NEVADA: When a president contin ues to ask for billions of money that he knows is going to be borrowed in Iraq, he today vetoed one of the most important bills that we could send him.GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Congress needs to cut out that pork, reduce the spending, and se nd me a responsible measure that I can sign into law.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, HOST: Well, there's a fight for you. The president has vetoed another bill. This one funded the Department of Labor Health and Human Services, and Department of Education, none of them particular favorites among Republicans anyway.But the Democrats say that the amount of money that's involved is minor, that he is doing this for political show. But the battle is joined, as it has been on a whole series of other issues.Some thoughts on all this now from Bill Kristol, Editor of ""The Weekly Standard,"" Nina Easton, Washington Bureau Chief of ""Fortune Magazine,"" and the syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, Fox News contributors all.Nina, you've wrote about this particular fight over this particular bill. Is this a veto that the president can sustain, in your judgment?NINA EASTON, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ""FORTUNE MAGAZINE"": This is part of the president's trying to remake himself as a fiscal conservative.After we saw the Transportation Bill a couple of years ago, which was pork-laden, had the bridge to nowhere, and horse trails for Virginia, et cetera, signed by the president, he has been accused by conservatives for not being fiscally conservative.So now the White House is determined --HUME: Will he win this, do you think?EASTON: I think he could win it. But you have to look at the bigger battle, and the bigger question is can the Democrats -- what they are trying to do is regain, or gain the reputation of fiscal conservatives. And they will continue this battle over and over again, sending these bills--HUME: How are they going to get that if they are sending bill --EASTON: That he says are too expensive. They're going to try to, not only on this, but on the broader issues, say that it's -- as they pointed out today, priceless for the president to consider himself a fiscal conservative.But also they are trying to show him as mean-spirited, whether it comes to HHS or S-chip.BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": The good news for the Republicans is that the president is picking these fights with a Democratic congress. Bush is not on the ballot, he is not running in 2008. The Republican nominee won't come from the Bush administration in 2008.The Democratic nominee will come from the Democratic Congress, most likely, if it is Senator Clinton or Senator Obama, and the Democratic Congress will be an ongoing issue in November 2008. They're on the ballot again.And I think the Bush administration and the Republicans in Congress are doing a pretty good job of defining this Democratic Congress as a pork- spending, tax-raising, Iraq defeat-embracing, no-terrorist-eavesdropping -- that will be next month when the debate on the terrorist eavesdropping bill comes up -- Congress.I think this Democratic Congress is a problem for the Democratic Party next year.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: That's a good bumper sticker, but you need a hummer to put it on.The president, I think, is playing his very weak hand very well. As of a year ago he was pronounced dead. But he did what Clinton did after he lost the midterm election, losing both Houses of Congress, he proved once again he is relevant.And the president did it with a weaker hand because he was in year six, when his is a lame duck, and also with an unpopular war, which is draining all of his popularity. But I think the big stroke he did is he doubled down his bet on Iraq right after the election last year. It is because of that that you have had the surge, you've had the relative success.And even though you have had a minor swing in public opinion, it's large enough that it's influenced the Congress, and he has remained in control of the war policy.And what's hard for Democrats above all is not this spending stuff, it's the fact that they claimed a mandate to end the war and they haven't, which hurts them on their left. But among moderates and independents, and others who don't want to see America defeated, they appear as a party anxious to shackle the war effort in a way to ensure defeat.So it's a lose-lose proposition on Iraq. Iraq already was going to hurt the Republicans, and they had already taken their political losses. Now, this year, the real story is Iraq has really hurt the Democrats.EASTON: I agree. I think this is more than the spending is the toughest nut for the Democrats. Nearly half of Democrats think, voter Democrats, think that the party leaders have not done enough to challenge George Bush over Iraq.HUME: In the Political Journal that came out, they did a tally on the number of votes that had been taken in one way or another to halt or impede the war in Iraq. There were 40 of them, and none of them has become law. So they are 0-40 on Iraq.EASTON: Yes, 0-40. They passed one, and the president vetoed it.They're stuck in this position. They're going to get caught up now, particularly in presidential politics. They're getting nipped on their left by presidential contenders, not just the party base.And then they've got not only moderate Republicans not willing to jump onboard with this, they've got conservative Democrats -- a lot of those new Democrats who came in are more reluctant to get onboard.KRISTOL: Yes. Those conservative Democrats, I think, should start watching out for their future. They're following Nancy Pelosi and, I think, in the Senate, as well, they're following the Democratic leadership down a dangerous road politically for them.HUME: When we come back, the deepening crisis in Pakistan. Can diplomatic troubleshooter John Negroponte make a difference there? More with the all-stars on a dangerous place when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PERVEZ MUSHARRAF, PAKISTANI PRESIDENT: She is trying to gain public support. She has come here with utterances which have gone against public opinions. I don't think she is reading the pulse of the people of Pakistan.GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: He has agreed to hold elections in January, and he's agreed to take his uniform of. And our judgment is that the sooner he can suspend his emergency decree, the faster Pakistan gets back on the road to democracy.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: Well, folks, did you catch what Musharraf said, enlisting grievances against Bhutto? He says she's trying to gain public support -- Oh, my god! She's coming here with utterance which have gone against public opinion. She's not reading the pulse of the people of Pakistan.All of which raises the question, if all that's true, then what is he worried about? Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: He is worried about being eased out, and that's why he declared martial law.This is a very hard situation from the American perspective, but it is not hopeless, at least not yet. The reason it isn't hopeless is because there is an endgame here, which we can see.If we can achieve an endgame in which you have elections in January, and you have Bhutto and her allies winning, and earning legitimate power, you have the Musharraf stepping down in the military, and his deputy, to the extent that he is political at all, is pro-American and anti-Al-Queda, is dependable. And then you try to ease Musharraf out in January.But how do you get from here to there? The real problem is you've got to get a lifting of martial law, otherwise Bhutto will boycott elections, it will be a farce, and you will have a crisis.A compromise might be where Musharraf declares a date of elections, say early in January, and four weeks before lifting a martial law in order to permit campaigning.If you have that kind of compromise, and if there is nothing radical that happens between now and then--which means nobody dies -- up until now, the military has been pretty gentle by the standards of that part of the world with demonstrations. Nobody has died.The minute you've got a dead man, a martyr, and a bloody shirt, then you cannot undo what has happened.Up until now, I think Bhutto has been moderate and cagey, and you could walk that dog back. If there is a death and a confrontation, I think it will be impossible.EASTON: You have to hope that this is all a grand piece of political theater, which some officials have suggested it is.HUME: You mean that they both know how this is going to come out, and they are just acting their parts?EASTON: There is a poll that showed Bhutto at 26 percent support, and Musharraf at 21 percent. The former prime minister has some amount of support.It is not a done deal on who would win an election, but you have to hope that this won't lead to further violence, because that will destabilize things. Clearly, the administration is trying to play the waiting game, not cutting off aid, saying they're reviewing aid but not cutting it off, not pulling the rug out from Musharraf.KRISTOL: They are sending Deputy Secretary Negroponte over there earlier this weekend. This is the Marcos moment, I think, where we tell our ally, the friendly and decent dictator, that his time has passed.The problem with these friendly dictators is they end up wanting to hang on, they like being dictators beyond when it is in their country's national interest, and beyond when it is in our interest.I think this actually manageable. I do think Musharraf is going to have to go.HUME: But if he goes, he would probably have to leave the country. First of all, we're telling Musharraf to step down from the presidency -- or we expect that he will lose -- that he has to strip himself of his military authority, which means he doesn't have that job anymore. He is really a man without a job, and, perhaps, a man without a country, right?KRISTOL: Well, Marcos went to Hawaii. But Musharraf might not have to leave. Pakistan is not a place where they go -- they have occasionally killed ex-presidents. But there this is big civil society there. This is not Iran in 1979. I think it is a mistake for people to use the Shah of Iran analogy.There are not Khomeinist Islamists in the streets of Islamabad. There are lawyers and normal people saying give us back democracy in the streets of most of the major cities.There is a terror problem in the northwest of Pakistan, which Musharraf, unfortunately, has not cracked down in the last year.HUME: And certainly not since martial law was declared.KRISTOL: No. And we made a very disastrous deal with him about a year ago. So I think it's going to be tough. It's delicate. I'm moderately optimistic that this will come out OK.HUME: So your view is watch Negroponte?KRISTOL: Watch Negroponte and what message he delivers in private.HUME: Do you agree with that?EASTON: Yes. And I agree also that it just has to play out further, and hope that there is no violence.KRAUTHAMMER: His job is to ease out Musharraf, not now, but after elections, guarantee him safety and security, and have a tacit agreement with Bhutto about that.Content and Programming Copyright 2007 FOX News Network, LLC.
