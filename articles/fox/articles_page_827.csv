This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" September 26, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, a history making showdown.  Fifteen months in the making. Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump in the highly anticipated first presidential debate. And it appeared nothing was off limits.Welcome to a live 11:00 p.m. edition of ""The Kelly File,"" everyone I'm Megyn Kelly. Reporting tonight from the spin room at Hofstra University. It was just about 20 minutes ago that the 90 minutes slug fest ended. And now, the candidates and their supporters are furiously trying to spin the narrative. Interestingly it was Hillary Clinton who struck first, hitting Donald Trump on his privileged past and from there, things went downhill, quickly.Much of the debate was not necessarily focused on policy, but on the politics of personal destruction. And when it was all over, analysts say Mrs. Clinton scored by saying on offense, but Mr. Trump hardly disqualified himself. Here are just a few highlights. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You have to judge us. Who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency?DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?CLINTON: I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that help to create more new jobs.TRUMP: Well, you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years.CLINTON: Well, I've been a senator --TRUMP: You haven't done it.CLINTON: I have been a secretary of state. And I have done --TRUMP: Excuse me. You have been signed NAFTA, which is one of the worst thing that's ever happened --  CLINTON: That is your opinion.  TRUMP: She's telling us how to fight ISIS, she's go to her website, she tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur like that.LESTER HOLT, MODERATOR: All right. The next segment, we're continuing the subject --CLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.  TRUMP: No, no. You're telling the enemy everything you want to do.CLINTON: No, we're not.TRUMP: You're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.  CLINTON: I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns because there is something he's hiding.TRUMP: A typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good. Doesn't work.Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words. And that is law and order.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing to go right at implicit bias, do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?CLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone. Not just police.TRUMP: Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There is no question about that.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: We have a huge show lined up for you tonight. In moments, we'll check in with Hillary Clinton's National Press Secretary Brian Fallon along with Trump campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway. Marc Thiessen is here. Mo Elleithee is here as well. Plus, Judge Andrew Napolitano has been standing by.But we begin tonight with Chris Stirewalt and Howie Kurtz who are right here with me on the set. Great to see you guys both here in the spin alley.  CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: And how about that?KELLY: Your reaction.STIREWALT: How about them apples? That's what I say.KELLY: Exciting.STIREWALT: We've been waiting to get down to it and we got down to it.  KELLY: And they went for it. I mean, Palmieri (ph) was like, oh, we're just going to, I mean, that was spin I suppose.STIREWALT: We're going to have a conversation with the American people, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Pow, pow, pow, pow. I think she had a better night than he did. But he definitely didn't take himself at anything. And I would remind any Trump supporters who are feeling a little uneasy about his performance tonight, there three of these suckers. Right?  And he's going to get better at these things.KELLY: Like we've had with Romney and President Obama.STIREWALT: Exactly. He's going to get better at these things as he is aware of the format and understands it better, he let a lot of opportunities go by this time, especially on her email. There were shades of Romney and Benghazi with Obama that he just let the email issue just slide right off the table and didn't press her on that.  KELLY: He had one line come back that was good.  STIREWALT: That was a very good line. Where he talked about it was intentional and there was all that. But he let it go because she distracted him by making fun of his taxes.  KELLY: Right. And Howie, your thoughts?HOWIE KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": The good news for Donald Trump is that he discussed serious issues for 90 minutes. For the Secretary of State, didn't commit any major gaffes. But Hillary Clinton won the night on points. She was aggressive out of the gate and in basketball terms, she controlled the ball. So even when Donald Trump was scoring points, he was doing so on response to her on her issues. She particularly was strong during the birther exchange, his tax returns, his stiffing private businessman, and sure Trump scored some points. But she kind of controlled the tempo of the evening. She also got some help I think from Mr. Holt.  KELLY: How so? What do you mean? You're a media critic.KURTZ: Well, for all of the debate about Lester Hold and what he fact check and so forth. The most aggressive questions from the NBC moderator, the most attempts have fact checking, the most interruptions were all into Trump particularly on the birther issue, on race issue and on the tax returns. I don't think there's any question about it.STIREWALT: I mean, to be fair, I thought Mr. Holt did a pretty good job.  KURTZ: He let them go at it which is good. It was a tough situation. But on those instances you're talking about, Trump didn't answer the questions, right? Trump was deflecting. But on the email, the only thing he asked Clinton was to respond Donald Trump bringing up as opposed to --  KELLY: Well, you can do it like that as a moderator if you know you want to get to it. The point is to get them talking about. But he opened the debate with the subject very favorable to Trump.STIREWALT: Yes.  KELLY: Trump had very solid 15, 20 minutes on TPP, in trade and he was doing great at the beginning. Right?STIREWALT: Right. Right.KELLY: It wasn't until he was put on the defense that things started to --  STIREWALT: And then Lester Holt goes into the bar and opens the door, opens all the stable doors and waits there for Trump to come run the horses out and trample her on email and he starts going back to his taxis.  KURTZ: I think Hillary Clinton's bemused expression as she responded to and deflected some of Donald Trump's one liners got under his skin. He started to talk louder, faster, trying to compete with her. And as time went on, it seemed to me that he got a little more disjointed and she was - -  KELLY: You tell me whether she got a little cocky in the end there. That one shot, with the shoulders. And she had done a good job of keeping her composure throughout the debate. She had a couple lines that fell flat where she said, I think he's making fun of the fact that I stayed home to prepare for this debate, do you know what else I prepared for? This presidency. Like --(CROSSTALK)It was just a throw away comment he made like I was in these cities, you weren't there. I don't know if, you tell me whether it requires a response or the shoulder shake.STIREWALT: She also made a notable error on the same thing, about being cocky, about being arrogant. At the end, when Lester Holt heated up and said, Mr. Trump, you said she didn't look presidential, is that about her gender? Is that about her being a woman? And her answer was that stupid thing that she says all the time. About I flew to these many countries and like -- you're letting it go by, then she realized belatedly, oh, right, I have something to say about him being sexist and I forgot to say she kind of jammed it in.  KELLY: All right. I want to stand you by. We're going to go back to you guys because we have Charles Krauthammer lined up. And I want to get your thoughts. Charles, what did you think?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, I mean, it was not exactly the knock out fight that we thought. It was a spirited fight. I think in the end it was something like a draw. But I do believe that the draw goes to the challenger in the sense that Trump did not go over the line. And the very fact that he could go 90 minutes on the same stage automatically elevates the challenger. That's just automatic for any debate of that sort. I think he did allow himself to get very defensive and she exploited that.She kept coming back to things where he wasted a lot of time on taxes, on some of the other issues that he felt personally about, and, as a result, he missed a lot of opportunities. She presented herself as she always does. Solid, solid, knows her stuff, not terribly exciting but reliable.  And I think that is the best that she can do. Likable as she couldn't but that was not something within her reach. And he contained himself in the sense that, I don't think he committed any gaffes. But he allowed himself to sort of, she could find something personal about him that would make him go down radicals at a time when he had wide openings to go after her on e- mails and other items, and let them go.  KELLY: What did you make of the fact that prior to the debate, analysts were saying they both needed to reach out to college-educated white voters.  That they're fighting over this colleague-educated white voters that would normally be voting Republican, but have some hesitancy over Trump, sub- urban whites in particular did either make any progress as you saw it with that group.  KRAUTHAMMER: I don't think so at all. I don't think there was anything of substance that would capture one constituency or another. That either of them said. I think this is all about atmospherics, all about personality.  I mean, the reason the debate was so anticipated is in the that people wanted to hear what would be said on this issue or that, people have heard the issues expressed by the candidates nonstop, now, for months.They know their positions. They wanted to see how they interact and what their demeanor is. And I thought on demeanor she came out slightly ahead but nonetheless, because so he was heralded as a guy who sort of out of control, you can't trust nuclear codes to and all that. The fact that he was reasonably sort of moderate, moderating himself, I think is to his advantage. So on edge, if you had to say, does it have an impact?  Probably not. But anything it would at least not stopped his momentum.KELLY: Charles, great to see you. My pleasure.KRAUTHAMMER: So there was a big reaction from debate observers tonight when Mrs. Clinton took her first question on emails. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I made a mistake using a private email.  TRUMP: That is for sure.  CLINTON: And if I had to do it over again, I would obviously do it differently, but I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake and I take responsibility for that.  HOLT: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth, so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it's disgraceful, really thinks it's disgraceful, also.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Brian Fallon who is the national press secretary for the Clinton campaign. Brian, great to see you.  BRIAN FALLON, NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN: Thanks for having me.  KELLY: So, I'm sure you think that she won and she did beautifully. But let me ask you --FALLON: I do.KELLY: Let me ask you this before we get to the spin. She's taking some hits for claiming she didn't say that NAFTA was a gold standard. She did say that. Right? So, what did you make of the fact checking that was done on the spot?FALLON: On TPP?KELLY: Yes. I'm sorry. On TPP.FALLON: Right. So, look. I think she explained that in the course of the debate. At one point when she was secretary of state, she was hoping that the deal -- it was final negotiated in this full detail, would be something she could support. Once she has had the details of it, it feel to me they're test, she's been pretty clear and open about that.  KELLY: But she denied saying that it was the gold standard and she did say that.  FALLON: That was something that was said in an earlier point before the deal was negotiated. I think overall though, she only issued the economy.  The first 15 minutes were devoted to the subject of the economy. I think she took her fight to Donald Trump right away. The economy was the number one issue that we wanted to talk about in this debate because it's a number one issue on the minds of all the voters including on the persuadable voters that are left in this election still making up their minds.And I think from the beginning, she showed that she was a candidate that have the plans to get wages rising in this country and she really put him on his heels when she said she wants to build an economy that works for everybody. Not just those that have a long -- to help get them started in business. And that really seemed to have merit.  KELLY: So, what, over all, did she execute the plan that you had for her?  Because we were told that she wasn't really going to try him out, that she didn't think it was worth it. But it seemed like that was exactly what she did, she was on the attack most of the night.  FALLON: Well, I have to be honest. We were surprised by the Donald Trump that showed up tonight. I mean, this is the Donald Trump that we saw throughout the primary. But I really thought that his debate coaches like Roger Ailes and Kellyanne Conway were really going to impress upon him the need to really come and try to strike and even tone and show a temperament that he hasn't shown at any point in this campaign in the last second bid to try to seem like he was temperamentally fit to be commander-in-chief.Instead I think that anybody that has concerns about Donald Trump heading into this debate only have those concerns. This was somebody that from the tail end of the debate, seemed to really go off the rails. And at one point tried to, well, I think that he doubled down on some of the biggest lies that he's told in this campaign. Whether it was his role in promoting the birtherism theory or his support for the Iraq war. I think that led to a tangent that was quite frankly hard to follow.  KELLY: Wait, can I ask you about the birtherism though because understanding all that Trump did to promote that lie. Okay?FALLON: Right.KELLY: Granting for the purposes of this discussion that he did promote that. She did some of that as well.FALLON: She didn't.  KELLY: Explain why that is true.FALLON: Sure.KELLY: Trump was right that the McClatchy bureau chief from the time came out to him and said that Sid Blumenthal who was her right hand came to him and said, go to Kenya. Go investigate this. We think Trump may have been born there. And so, somebody in Kenya to go and investigate it.  FALLON: So, Politico looks into those things actually and a couple of weeks ago, Blake Hounshell from Politico actually published a report, he talked to the reporters that were based overseas that were actually tasked by this senator in Washington to look into this. And they said this is something else entirely. We weren't looking into birtherism.  KELLY: They said they couldn't remember. They said they went over. And what the reporter who spoke with this McClatchy bureau chief said was, I'm certain that would have been one of the things that they would asked us to look into. He said, I don't actively recall it but I'm certain it's one of the things they would asked us to look into.FALLON: So what Donald Trump really stressed in the debate stage tonight, he invoked the former campaign manager of Hillary Clinton from 2008.  KELLY: Patti Solis Doyle.FALLON: Right. And said that she went on television last week and admitted that they had some role in the birtherism conspiracy. That's not at all what she said. She acknowledged that there was one original organizer in Iowa -- and as soon as they learned about it, they fired that person. There is a huge difference between --KELLY: Just to let our audience know, this is your candidate, Hillary Clinton leaving the building, probably going home and taking a rest after a long, long night here in -- and the former president Bill Clinton, after a long long night here at Hofstra University which was full of fireworks.  Sorry Brian, go ahead.FALLON: Well, I think actually that we have a debate watch party close by.  KELLY: Oh, is that right?FALLON: We'll see.KELLY: Okay. It wasn't a comment on her health, I'm just saying it's been a hell of a day for even the reporters. Never mind the candidate.  FALLON: I think she was pretty tireless up there.  KELLY: She seemed very fine. Her health is fine. Is she over pneumonia?FALLON: Well, I think it takes a while to get over pneumonia. But she certainly didn't show any signs of it tonight.  KELLY: Before we move away from the birther issue, and I wanted to see if we have the sound bite, do we have the sound bite about -- on Trump talking about how he did President Obama a favor? All right. We don't. But let me paraphrase. He basically said, and I have the note here, that I think I did a great job for the whole country on that and for the president himself to get him to release that birth certificate. There were audible gasps inside the auditorium when he said that. What was your reaction?FALLON: I mean, what nerve, what chutzpah to act like he did the president a favor after trafficking in a bigoted birtherism conspiracy for five years and undercut our first African-American president. I think Hillary Clinton put in pretty poignant terms about what that meant both to the country and to the President personally, and it's a shame that he just won't apologize.  KELLY: What do you make of the fact that these polls have tightened to a place that has got to be someone uncomfortable for the Clinton campaign.  She has, you know, almost seven point lead in the Real Clear Politics average. Now, it's down to Colorado, he's up one now. Pennsylvania within two. All states that she's winning in double digits just a month ago.  FALLON: Absolutely. You're exactly right. The race is tight. And one thing that I don't think people should conclude from tonight is even though I think this is a huge victory for Hillary Clinton, I don't expect it to change in the polls. I think that is just the nature of the race. I think the contest is going to be tight all the way through to the finish line and it's really going to come down to the ground game.KELLY: Last question. Hillary Clinton went on record, and called yours truly a superb journalist when Trump was attacking me. Why won't she come on ""The Kelly File""?FALLON: I agree a thousand percent that her characterization of yours as a superb journalist, and I think it's only a matter of time.  KELLY: Before the election?FALLON: I'm going to go back right after I walk off this platform here and make the case --KELLY: Good. Good.FALLON: -- to get her on the show.  KELLY: Brian, thank you.FALLON: Okay.KELLY: I appreciate you being here. Now, Donald Trump is leaving. Maybe he is going home to rest. That is what I'm going to be doing after I leave here. Maybe he's going to watch -- but you can see Donald Trump with his entire family. That is Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner who many insiders connected to the campaign say has more influence over the way Donald Trump run his campaign than anyone else. Ivanka and Jared have become really important to Donald Trump in how he handles himself and makes his strategic decisions in there of course as Melania Trump and the rest of Trump's family. What a night for both candidates. And what a night for all of us.How many millions of Americans tuned in to watch that rumble here in Hofstra. More must see reaction on the way with former George W. Bush speechwriter Marc Thiessen, the one gaffe he says he saw tonight. And in 2008, Clinton campaign travelling Press Secretary Mo Elleithee. Also ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Tucker Carlson is here along with former White House Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton, Judge Andrew Napolitano who helped us through the entire email scandal is here tonight with a fascinating take.And then supporters of both candidates debate who won the night. Robert Zimmerman and David Wohl are back in two minutes. Don't go away.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: When ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton, and believe me, you're the ones that took out the troops. Not only that. You named -- they couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said --(CROSSTALK)Wait a minute. When they formed -- when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. Should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there and you were Secretary of State when it was a little infant. Now, it's just over 30 countries and you're going to stop them? I don't think so.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: You've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?  And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he said he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks or maybe, he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was Hillary Clinton on the attack, questioning why Donald Trump will not release his tax information. He says he's under audit.Joining us now, supporters of both candidates, David Wohl, an attorney and a Donald Trump supporter. And Mark Cuban, entrepreneur and Hillary Clinton supporter and host of ""Shark Tank.""Great to see you both. Let me start with you, Mark. Because you made a lot of news over the weekend because Hillary put you in the front row.MARK CUBAN, ENTREPRENEUR: That is right.KELLY: To get into Donald Trump's head.KELLY: And do you feel you did that?CUBAN: No. No. And let me just give you the exact story. I wanted to bring my 12-year-old daughter who is turning 13 to the debate. And so, they got me two tickets and I decided to tweet and added that I was going but I just added the part that I added front row.KELLY: So, you went rogue on that.CUBAN: So I went rogue on that. And I didn't think it would blow up.KELLY: Next thing you know, Gennifer Flowers is called to show up.  CUBAN: Oh, God! So, yes.  KELLY: You were happy there was no Gennifer?CUBAN: I didn't care. I was just there for the event.  KELLY: You were happy there was no Gennifer.DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY: Well, I think it would have been a circus side show, yes. But --KELLY: All right. Let me get you to react to the first, you know, 20 minutes that we had here. Because these are all objective, you know, political analyst. They're not Trump fans, they're not Hillary fans, they're just saying how they thought.WOHL: I thought right off the bat, Hillary looked like she's breathing a prompter. I mean, it really looked scripted. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. But then, I saw Trump and frankly he did revert to the original Donald Trump. The Trump that blew him up to where he is right now. That sort of off the cuff spontaneous --KELLY: You like that?WOHL: I like it. His voters love it. He got his issues out there. You know, he put America first out there. He got to save jobs. Don't let jobs flee the country. He's got his law and order out there. And he's got a little bit, not enough -- into Hillary Clinton's tax situations, the e- mails.  KELLY: He took the bait on that. When she went through why isn't he releasing his tax returns?WOHL: But he should have gone right --KELLY: He didn't pivot way from it.  WOHL: He should have gone right into her problems with the emails, her problems with the Clinton Foundation. Look, if the IRS says, I can release my taxes and my lawyer says no, I'm not releasing it.KELLY: Yes. Right.WOHL: I will listen to my lawyer's advice and that is what it boils down to. So, I think it was a red herring. It was a distraction. And threw him off a little bit.  KELLY: Mark, did you think -- most of the analysts are saying that Trump had a strong 15-20 minutes on the economy. You know, on trade was his issue. Mexico, China, on TPP, on NAFTA. Did you agree with that?CUBAN: Yes. I agree with it. I mean, I don't necessary agree on what he was saying but he was cool, calm, when he was talking about it. But the rest of the debate he was counter punching like he tries to do but he never took control of a question. Remember, we had -- there was a moderator who asked questions and more often than not he didn't answer the question and never got around to answering question. And you can tell that it kind of frazzled him. And then when Secretary Clinton came back with specifics, he was just deflecting and changed the topic. I just didn't feel, he had a real opportunity to take control of his issues and prove that he understood them, and he didn't do that at all.  KELLY: Do you think that she was fact-checked enough? Because, you know, she claimed that she never TPP was a gold standard and she did. She brushed off the Sydney Blumenthal thing is not true, but it is true. I mean, at least there's evidence for it.CUBAN: Well, and that is fine, right? And he just brought it up and they just moved on, right? Both ways. So, yes, everybody is going to fact- check after the fact, but Donald had a chance, if he really understood those issues to talk more about them. Because it wasn't like he just stuck to the script. He went in whatever direction he wanted to do.WOHL: No, I thought --CUBAN: They asked him, what are you going to do about domestic terrorism and he still hasn't answered it.   WOHL: You know, I thought he did unbelievably well when it came to law and order, crime and justice. And the issue of crime in New York City, you recall that Hillary Clinton says it's gone down, Donald Trump says, that's a lie. And it turns out, rape, robbery, murders skyrocketed, property crime, inconsequential crime is down. So, he should have brought that up a little, more formally but that is true. Really serious crimes is way up.  When it comes to law and order, she won't even say those words and that's critical --  KELLY: We actually have a sound bite of that. Let's watch Trump and Hillary arguing over crime in New York City.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very, very big impact.  CLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say if we're going to talk about mayors that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is --TRUMP: You're wrong. You're wrong.CLINTON: No, I'm right.TRUMP: Murders are up.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Murders are up and these are the facts. In 2014, it was 333 murders. In 2015, it was 352 murders.CUBAN: What was the question?(CROSSTALK)CUBAN: And he deflected from the question, right? Because the question then that was asked by Lester, is it constitutional? And then he went talking about local judges and deal with --  (CROSSTALK)KELLY: In New York.WOHL: In New York. And as it turns out when they did stop and frisk, they often found people who are illegally carrying weapons.CUBAN: Okay.WOHL: So Black, White, Hispanic --  CUBAN: Where does stop and frisk end? Who gets to determine who is stopped and who is frisked? Let me finish.KELLY: Let him finish.CUBAN: Because at point they're just going to stop and frisk you and look for a gun. So there is a lot more at stake.WOHL: They have to articulate a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is -- that is a standard. And when they can do that, that's not what he said.KELLY: But let me ask you this. What about the accusation that Trump did not get specific on the plan for ISIS again?WOHL: Well, look. I mean he asked that before that he's going to carpet bomb the, you know what out of them. I think he would do that. He can get very, very aggressive. But he also acknowledges that is hard to deal with.  Number one priority is stopping them here, and every single week, we're seeing a new attack.KELLY: I got to ask you this.CUBAN: Two more debates.KELLY: We have a bunch to get but I have got to ask you this. Why don't you like Donald Trump? You're a billionaire. He's a billionaire. Is it professional envy, jealously, you know, gorilla situation? What is it?CUBAN: No. It's about my kids, it's about the future of this country.  But you saw his temperament. At the base of everything he said tonight, he said, he would not honor our commitments as a country. And he proved that, that's his way of doing business.  WOHL: Like NATO when they're not going to pay their fair share.  CUBAN: Yes. But exactly. And world peace. What is more important?  Asking for more money from Japan or world peace?WOHL: We'll get both. We will get both. They have to pay their fair share if they want our forces to risk their lives.  CUBAN: Fair share is relative to Donald Trump. He stiffed architects and thousands of people and he stood up there on the debate stage that they just didn't do it. Maybe I didn't think they did a good enough job and that is why they didn't get paid. So, what are you going to say to Japan when North Korea decides to test in their direction? While you didn't pay enough so we're not going to be there for you?WOHL: We all know --KELLY: We have to leave it at that.WOHL: Okay.KELLY: Great to see you both. That was fun. That was --WOHL: Awesome.  KELLY: Okay. As I mentioned a moment ago, one of the big moments early in this debate came when Donald Trump went after Mrs. Clinton on the issue of trade and her support for the TPP deal. Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Just to ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?CLINTON: I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.  TRUMP: Excuse me.CLINTON: And I have done --TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to manufacturing. You said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would you approve that. And that would be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.  CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in --TRUMP: You called it the gold standard.CLINTON: Well --TRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.  CLINTON: No.  TRUMP: And then, you heard what I said about it and all of a sudden, you were against it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Mrs. Clinton repeatedly denied Trump's claims, suggesting at one point, he lived in a world of made-up information. But here was Mrs. Clinton back in 2012.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: We need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. Australia is a critical partner.This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade, and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institution fellow and Fox News Contributor, and Mo Elleithee, executive director at Georgetown University's Institution of Politics and Public Service.Great to see you both.MARC THIESSEN, FELLOW, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE (?): Good (ph) to see you, Megyn.KELLY: I mean, let's just -- let's just cut through it. She flipped on TPP. She -- she flipped on it.MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Yes, I mean, look, I think she gave herself enough room (ph) in the beginning that she got to a point where she can say, look, you know, if this thing isn't negotiated the way I like it, then I'm not going to be important (ph).  That's where she is.It's more probably one of her tougher things that she's dealing with.KELLY: Because she flipped.(LAUGHTER)ELLEITHEE: Well, when you look at it and compare it to the rest of this -- the rest.KELLY: OK, fine, fine. There's plenty of, you know, blame to go around.ELLEITHEE: Yes.KELLY: But she flipped on that issue. He had her on that one.THIESSEN: If she -- if she had said what Mo just said, she'd be fine.KELLY: Yes, that's right.THIESSEN: But that's not what she said.KELLY: She denied it.THIESSEN: Yes, exactly.KELLY: The other thing is that we didn't get to yet, she -- she accused him of saying climate change is a hoax and that it was done for the benefit of China. He -- he denied that. He did send that out in a tweet in 2012.It's still on his Twitter feed. He later tried to claim that that was a joke. But he repeatedly referred to climate change as a hoax and recently said that it's for the benefit of China.So they lie. I mean, that's what we are left with.(LAUGHTER)They lied to us. And we, as the media, have to try to separate the wheat from the chaff. What did you think was the biggest gap?THIESSEN: Well, the biggest gap, I think, was on nuclear policy. And I don't think it's going to have a big impact on voters because I think it's -- it's -- it's kind of in the weeds.But he said that he -- he -- he seemed to take nuclear.KELLY: So it's (ph) Trump -- Trump, you mean (ph).THIESSEN: Trump -- Trump -- Trump seemed to take a nuclear first strike off the table, which would make him the first president in the nuclear  age going all the way back to -- to Eisenhower to have taken a nuclear first strike off the table. That's very troubling for national security concern as you're looking and they're struggling with whether to vote for Trump or not, that that -- that struggle came up (ph).KELLY: And who think (ph) that she may be more of a hawk than he is?THIESSEN: Yes, possibly.KELLY: All right, let's go bigger picture now. What was your impression of the debate?ELLEITHEE: You know, look, Donald Trump's bar was really low coming in.  The problem with a low bar is it's easy to trip over it. I think he totally tripped over it tonight.I don't he met even low expectations.KELLY: Why?ELLEITHEE: I think he came -- he reverted to primary Trump, right, at a time when he was trying to -- and his team said he was going to sort of elevate. He reverted to primary Trump but without -- with less charm, right?I mean, he was angry. He was defensive. She got under his skin very early. I thought she might one or two points in the debate. But I mean, from like 10 minutes in through the duration, she was clearly in his head and under his skin.And I don't think he reacted well. She took him off his game. His core message was missing.KELLY: So they both want to be likable, Marc.THIESSEN: Yes.KELLY: He -- maybe, she was doing a good job of making him seem a little, you know, boorish. But then, towards the end, with her like with the shoulders, it was like.THIESSEN (?): Yes.KELLY: .wow, too much. We've gone too far. Am I wrong?THIESSEN: No, I don't think you're wrong. And I -- but I think that he made a big mistake in -- in constantly interrupting her, that.KELLY: We had a little bit of that. Do we have that sound bite because you can just -- just to show the audience what -- what we were seeing and how it felt here? Do we have it?Sorry, my team is doing a brilliant job. We have a lot of sound crews (ph) separating it out. Do you have it? Do you have the interrupting sound bite?Stand by. This is fun. Keep going. I won't interrupt you again, sorry.THIESSEN: But the point being is that he kept (ph) -- he came (ph) as consistently interrupting her. And if you go back to the first debate in 2000, when Al Gore was debating George W. Bush, he -- he won the debate on points, on substance.But he kept sighing. And he kept rolling his eyes. And so people looked at him and said, you look like a jerk. And -- and that was their impression.And I think to Trump's interrupting, even had (ph) a few sighs when she was.ELLEITHEE: A couple of (ph) groans, yes.THIESSEN: .a couple of groans, that that will be the -- the sigh and eye roll of the 2016 debate. So I think -- I think she came out ahead in this debate. But let's keep in mind that in 2012, Romney crushed Barack Obama in the first debate.KELLY: He did.ELLEITHEE: Yes.THIESSEN: So this is -- this is far from over.ELLEITHEE (?): That's right.KELLY: Barack Obama's top advisers pulled him after that debate and said, you sucked. And he was like what? And if they said you sucked, and even Michelle Obama pulled him aside and said yes, you suck.But he came out a different man.THIESSEN: But -- but does -- but does Donald Trump have people in his campaign who will turn around and look at him and say, ""You sucked tonight?""ELLEITHEE: Well, and more importantly, is he the kind of candidate who will listen to that.THIESSEN: Exactly, yes.ELLEITHEE: .and -- and recalibrate and adjust? I mean, if this entire campaign tells us anything, it's that he's not.KELLY: But did he lose any viewer -- I mean, any voters tonight, Mo, when you build (ph) that college-advocated (ph) white crowd that -- that they were telling -- they're telling if they're fighting over?ELLEITHEE: I don't think he expanded, right? If -- if that college- educated white crowd right now is sitting on the fence, I don't think he pulled them over to his side.I think, if anything, he raised doubts and concerns with a lot of these people on a whohle host of issues from foreign policy and national security to even the economy and taxes. When she said, you don't pay income taxes, and he said, that's because I'm smart.KELLY: It makes me smart.ELLEITHEE: .I mean, what does that say about the rest of us, chumps (ph), that do pay income taxes?(LAUGHTER)KELLY: We suck, too.(LAUGHTER)ELLEITHEE: Well (ph), all of us. Great to see you, guys.THIESSEN (?): Great to be here (ph).ELLEITHEE (ph): You, too.KELLY: Well, Donald Trump has made this campaign largely about his business past, saying he has the right experience to turn the country around. Mrs. Clinton, for her part, claims there are certain part of Mr. Trump's past dealing, he would like to ignore, even invoking his new campaign manager.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: If your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.And indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses. We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid what he was charging you to do.TRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work.CLINTON: .well, do -- do (ph).TRUMP: .which our country should do, too.CLINTON: .do the -- do (ph) the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business, not deserve some kind of apology?TRUMP: When Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Now, if you want to change the laws -- you've been there a long time -- change the laws.But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Well, that campaign manager joins me now. Kellyanne Conway is the manager of the Trump campaign.Kellyanne, great to see you. Thank you for being here.KELLYANNE CONWAY, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Hi, Megyn. Sure (ph).KELLY: All right, so first, what did you make of that? She's quoting the old you. I.(UNIDENTIFIED MALE): They may have to come to us.CONWAY: Right outside of Atlantic City. And my mother worked in one of the non-Trump casinos for 21 years. And that's the way she's supported us, including putting me through college and law school, in Catholic school my whole life.So I'd like to challenge her anytime to tell me that people like Donald Trump who revitalized Atlantic City didn't do a good job.KELLY: What do you make of the -- that -- that she came out swinging on this, that he stiffs the little guy and he doesn't pay the contractors.  And he didn't really defend it other than to say, maybe they didn't do a good job.You know, maybe they didn't do the job to my liking, which, you know, led to some people sort of ooing and aaying (ph) in the debate room. Was that a mistake for him to say that?CONWAY: I thought Mr. Trump, at different times tonight, showed great restraint -- more restraint than I may have in the face of fire and lies, particularly at the end, where he literally could have gone there and made very clear that he came ready to say some rough things if she was going to challenge him about his abuse -- about his record on women. And then, he decided he wouldn't do that in front of her husband and her daughter.And frankly, Megyn, you know, restraint is a virtue. And it's a presidential virtue. And I think for all those people who love to talk about tone and temperament, they ought to go, replay that clip and think of all of the things that we're going through, millions of Americans' heads that he didn't say.I really appreciated it. The other thing is that Donald Trump is somebody who has employed tens of thousands of people over the years. Think about that. He's compensating them.They're getting benefits. You're getting health care. And many of them are women. And he's promoted women to some of the highest special ones (ph) including at his campaign and to lead (ph) his corporation. What jobs has she created?Who has Hillary Clinton employed? I mean, the State Department doesn't count. We pay for them. They're taxpayer dollars.KELLY: Right.CONWAY: So I think his record on business creation, job creation.KELLY: Why didn't we.CONWAY: .is -- is unparalleled on that stage.KELLY: .why didn't he go harder after the email issue?  CONWAY: Well, he was the only one raising email issue tonight actually.  The moderator followed up, I think, he mentioned your emails. You have a response, Mrs. Clinton.KELLY: He might have had a question ready and this Trump to it to him first.CONWAY: Perhaps.KELLY: Sometimes, that happens.CONWAY: Perhaps. So Donald Trump did mention the fact that she has deleted 33,000 emails. It's very much very much on the minds of Americans.KELLY: But do you think he's going to go after her? I'm talking about Trump supporters who -- who wanted to see him go after that more. You know, she's had (ph) a big issue for a lot of voters. Do people (ph) see more of that in future debates from him?CONWAY: Well, I hope we'll see more of that, even before the debates. In other words, we don't have to wait for these three 90-minute blocks, Megyn, to find out who these people really are in the issues.Well, you did have to wait for that with Mrs. Clinton because she doesn't really give many policy features. If she saw.KELLY: Yes, no, or press interviews.CONWAY: .that's right. Thank you. She's -- if she's talking about policies, we don't know because we're not donors at her fund-raisers. And so -- and that -- that's an incredibly important point here because Mr. Trump is out there every single day.KELLY: Yes.CONWAY: .talking about policy. She waited until she filled her head with all these facts and figures, came to a debate and made sure we heard everything.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: No, it's harder -- it's much harder when you're sitting in this chair, and I can play the sound byte of you saying how TPP is the gold standard.CONWAY: That's right.KELLY: I mean, that's a much harder situation than being on the debate stage.CONWAY: That's exactly right.KELLY: .which is why she hope -- we hope she'll come here.CONWAY: Yes, yes.KELLY: So let me ask you to grade both performances -- his and hers.CONWAY: Oh, I'm so bad at that.KELLY: Just take a -- take a stab at it.CONWAY: I mean, I'd give them both a satisfactory in that I -- I guess 90 minutes went too quickly for me. There ae so many issues that could have fallen into those (ph) particular categories.We didn't America (ph), didn't hear that she's for late-term abortion, sex- selective abortion. And you can find that they're killing (ph) the baby and then.KELLY: Really do called (ph) social issues in the debate (ph).CONWAY: Right, and that she -- she was absolutely against gay marriage in 2008 and emphatically so, the first time she lost president and this time, when she still lose president, she changed her mind completely. There wasn't much on the border.And I think, frankly, her very amnesty-like open borders policy on immigration, what would she really do with Syrian refugees, they have -- they're very different on that issue. But that's not failing so much as -- of anybody on the debate stage so much as just the limited time.KELLY: Yes. The -- he was taking heat just a moment ago for interrupting her. You know, she was saying things with which she disagreed. And he would pipe in saying, not true or whatever.It -- they weren't -- you know, a was sort of a back and forth. Was that a mistake or was that fair game?CONWAY: It's fair to defend yourself. And I think sometimes, when you're in a situation like that, you're just so shocked that somebody would lie and try to spin it in such a way in real time in front of tens of  millions of people, Megyn, he feels the only way to defend yourself is your natural reaction.Remember, he's not a politician. And so Hillary Clinton has participated in 34 primary debates. Let me just repeat that -- 34 primary debates.  It's a remarkable number.KELLY: He said all those primary debates.CONWAY: She's in fact.KELLY: .and said, he won everyone.CONWAY: He did as a non-politician (ph). He's a practiced -- she's a practiced politician and so he never asked me as a pollster (ph) what word do I use, which way should I look, what tie should I wear. And today, we don't have this conversation.KELLY: Soif he interrupts you (ph).CONWAY: And I respect that. No, by the way, he -- he -- I'm sorry to interrupting you.KELLY: No, no, no, no, go for it.CONWAY: .that wasn't nice but it wasn't sort of a (ph) -- no, here is what I want to get out. He was saying not true and no, that's or this is how it was or that's a fact.And instead of interrupting, know what she was doing, she was rolling her eyes. She was very glib. And sometime, she had a very smirk on her.KELLY: Last question. Why did he say that he never called climate change a hoax when he has many times and suggests that he didn't suggest it was for China's benefit because he did?CONWAY: Well, I think what he's saying is as a presidential candidate, where he's really studied these issues and talking (ph) with experts, he has said very clearly that he believes.KELLY: He said it recently. He said that -- that climate change is a hoax and -- and suggested that it was (ph) to China's benefit.CONWAY: I can tell you what he does say often that that is not what he (ph) said.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: No, I'm telling you that's what he (ph) says. So why did it he deny it?CONWAY: He thinks -- doesn't make it mean (ph) -- he's just saying -- he has said that so many scientists are exaggerating it because they're paid to do so. But he also has been very clear.They're very different on climate change.KELLY: Yes.CONWAY: It's probably a really great line demarcation for them because.KELLY: They are. But I'm trying -- you're suggesting that, you know, she lies and -- and you know, I think the conclusion of most people is all these politicians lie. We just have to find out which of the lies and which are.(CROSSTALK)CONWAY: Megyn, he's not a politician.KELLY: Well, he is now.(CROSSTALK)CONWAY: Well, yes, but think -- think about it, but in the newest ABC News, Washington Post poll, Megyn, more -- more Americans think that she's not honest and trustworthy than him.KELLY: Yes.CONWAY: .by a pretty significant margin. And I think part of is because.KELLY: OK.CONWAY: .she's had the record that is now going to be scoured.KELLY: Thank you very much for being here.CONWAY: .and tried (ph).  KELLY: A very busy night. Thank you. Appreciate it.So what are the other things that we heard from debate observers? And you heard this from a couple of our guests earlier, is that Lester Holt pressed to Donald Trump harder than he did Hillary Clinton.Here is an example from our sighting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I did not support a war in Iraq.HOLT: .in 2002.TRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.HOLT: My question is since you supported it, then why is your -- why is your judgment.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Just do (ph) -- would you like to hear? I was against the war.  Wait a minute, I was against the war in Iraq, just so you put it out. And I can.(CROSSTALK)HOLT: The record shows otherwise but why is -- why was -- is your judgment any.TRUMP: .the record does not show -- the record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone has asked me that, I said very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows, essentially.KELLY: Streaming now, Fox and Friends co-host Tucker Carlson and former White House deputy press secretary under President Obama, Bill Burton.Great to see you both.Tucker, what do you think?TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi, Megyn. Well, I mean, I think Trump won because he didn't melt down. I mean, it was a -- it was a low threshold.  I mean, does he know what kind of details to know as he talked about himself too much?Of course, he does. On the other hand, I mean, the basic point is he didn't invade Iraq. He didn't kill Qaddafi. He didn't take the housing market or bail out the banks or think of quantitative easing.He's not part of the unfolding disaster that we've watched for the past generation. And she is. And he made that point again and again.That's kind of all he needed to do. He is winning, by the way, in the polls. We're pretending he's not. He is. And so if he continues not to screw up, he will win. That's my view.KELLY: Bill?BILL BURTON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I agree with Tucker that, you know, politicians, they're (ph) created (ph) on a curve and the bar was very low for Donald Trump. But the problem is that he was a disaster tonight.You know, I thought that Hillary Clinton did well but listening to Kellyanne talk about the debate just reinforced the fact that they also thought it was a disaster. You just look at those guys walking out of a tunnel, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in their campaigns, virtually was waltzing (ph) out.Donald Trump was angry, you know, having a tough conversation. Look, he has to find a path to 270 electoral votes. It does not go through the kind of crazy intemperate rantings that you saw tonight only loosely associated with that.KELLY: Well, notwithstanding what you characterized as Trump, you know, he -- he is surging right now, Bill. And Colorado's within one.CARLSON: Yes.KELLY: .and Pennsylvania is within two, and Florida and Ohio are tight as could be. North Carolina is tight again. I mean, he's surging.BURTON: Yes, look, this is a close race. It was always going to be a close race. And I think that Hillary Clinton's numbers are artificially low because I don't think millennials are not going to support her at the numbers where they are.I think that the African-American and Latino votes can be higher than it currently shows in the polls. But for Donald Trump, he had a special issue that he had to attend to tonight and that's find the college-educated, suburban voters that he needs in order to actually lock in some of those states.Donald Trump may be moving ahead but there is not very many places where he is above 45, 46 percent. You've got to get to 50. And for him to push past shows final percentage points, he has to be a person that he showed tonight, he cannot be.KELLY: Tucker, it's always fun to blame the moderators. I've been there.  I thought Lester Holt did a fine job.CARLSON: Yes.KELLY: What did you think?CARLSON: YES, whatever. I mean, you know, we know who he's voting for. I don't think it really matters. What -- what matters is.KELLY: Bringing endorsement.CARLSON: .registered Republicans -- did Trump mean more (ph)? Who cares?  I mean -- and Trump I think wisely didn't whine about it because when you whine about that stuff, you try and weaken (ph), he gets that.I'm sure it annoyed him but whatever. The point is he had to convince the whatever -- the middle of the undecideds who aren't really actually undecided because they never are, they're hoping for permission to vote for the -- the insurgent against the incumbent. It's a changed election.So you want more of the same when you want change.KELLY: Yes.CARLSON: Most people want change. They're afraid of Trump. They think he's too volatile. So if he can convince them that he's basically not crazy, he wins, which is why he's winning.Look at the numbers.KELLY: It's great to see you both. Thanks, guys. Up next, Judge Napolitano and Dana Perino (ph) on what was not said tonight.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?TRUMP: I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And as soon as the audit's finished, it'll be released.HOLT: The IRS says.TRUMP: Excuse me.HOLT: .that audit of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal.TRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit -- look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted.As soon as she releases them, I will release. I will release my tax returns.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was Mr. Trump, both taking a hit and scoring a point when he turned the issue from his tax returns to Mrs. Clinton's emails. Dana Perino is with me now.She's co-host of ""The Five,"" and former White House Press Secretary under President George W. Bush, and Judge Andrew Napolitano is a Fox News senior judicial analyst.Great to see you both. So let me start with you, Dana while you're here.  How did you think it went?DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think that if you were at home and you were undecided, you might have said, oh, I still don't know. So the second debate becomes really important.I don't think that Trump expanded his base in any way. He probably didn't lose any supporters. I do think she did something that she needed to do, which is that she shored up wobbly Democrats.We know that Democrats have been pretty unenthusiastic about her candidacy.  They're not really sure. They don't really like her.She was not Bernie Sanders. She's not a President Obama. But tonight, I think that she was able to say, look, I'm here, I'm helping. I'm ready and I'm here to fight for you.KELLY: She certainly didn't look near-death as some of her detractors should not (ph) have us believe.Judge, all the time we have spent discussing this email issue and the immunity deals and the -- Director Comey and it was like -- it was like it -- it barely was there.JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: You know, I could tell you five times that she lied under oath. I could tell you about FBI agents who believe their hands were tied, intelligence assets who think Americans died because she failed to retain national security secrets.She -- he didn't go anywhere. He didn't mention any of that. I thought she clobbered him, that it wasn't even close because these debates are won or lost, not on debating points but by general impressions.The impression was she controlled the ball. He was on the defensive. And he utterly failed to address her singular weakness, which is the perception that she is unworthy of trust.KELLY: Wow. Well, it's interesting because he had all that Comey, you know, he has that back and forth with Director Comey and Trey Gowdy to -- to outline the number of falsehoods that were delivered to the FBI.NAPOLITANO: Right.KELLY: And -- but it does require a homework to deliver that kind of thing, Judge.NAPOLITANO: I don't think he was prepared. And since I know some of the people that were preparing him, I think some of their ideas probably went in one of his ear -- ears and out the other.And he thought he could win this debate the way he won the -- the primary debates. She was poised, charming, intelligent and for the first time, likable.KELLY: For the first time.So what do they do now, Dana?PERINO: I think that the Hillary Clinton campaign tomorrow morning will say, they are seizing back the initiatives. They realized that they had a terrible September.But they are going into October with the -- with the wind behind their back. And Donald Trump's team will say, he obviously is fit to be commander-in-chief.He did not disqualify himself and that, yes, who cares about debates because establishment politicians and hacks can do really great in debates.  It doesn't really matter.And I thought you made a very good point that she spent all the money for no reason.KELLY: Great to see you.You, too, Judge. We'll be right back. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Trump told CNN he thinks Lester Holt did a great job, was very fair. Who do you think won tonight's presidential debate? Go to facebook.com/thekellyfile and on Twitter @megynkelly.Let me know what you think. Thanks for watching, everyone. This is ""The Kelly File.""

McKeon on moving forward after Cantor's defeat	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" June 11, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Buck McKeon, is he still with us just in case? He is.Congressman, I know we have very limited time here. I apologize for that, given this.What do you think of this? What do you think of the message it is for the Republicans?REP. HOWARD ""BUCK"" MCKEON, R-CALIF.: Oh, I think, you know, we all felt badly that Eric lost.It was a big shock to all of us, something we hadn't even thought about. But the conference is strong, resilient. I think it's going to be a great Republican year. That's just a sad thing for Eric and his family right now, and it's a loss to the conference, but we will move forward.We have lots of -- lots of great leaders, and we will elect new ones and we will move forward.CAVUTO: So, Congressman, you feel as -- as he stated, that this is local to this district, it -- and all politics being local, don't make some national statement over it?MCKEON: We have 435 House races across the country.I think what really happened here, in my little time that I have spent here, and what I -- how I have observed things, when you go into leadership, such as Eric, you really give up your own life. You sacrifice a lot.CAVUTO: All right.MCKEON: I just thanked him for his sacrifice.CAVUTO: Congressman...MCKEON: So, he was working to support us and help us --CAVUTO: Gotcha.MCKEON: And he had to leave his own district a lot.CAVUTO: And we have to leave here.

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" August 23, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight. New headaches for the Clinton campaign as a stunning report from the Associated Press raises questions about her time at the State Department, about her family's foundation and about whether special access to Secretary Clinton was being sold to the highest bidders.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Just hours ago, the AP released an investigative report saying the majority of people who met with then-Secretary Clinton outside of government officials were folks who had given money to the Clinton Foundation. And it was not chump change.  Combined, they or their businesses contributed as much as $156 bucks. The Clinton campaign is slamming the AP's report as, quote, ""utterly flawed.""But this comes on the heels of another report showing Mrs. Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin. Giving preferential treatment to donors at the specific request of the Clinton Foundation. And just one day after her rival, Donald Trump, demanded a full-fledged investigation into this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The amounts involved, the favors done, and the significant number of times it was done, require an expedited investigation by a special prosecutor, immediately, immediately, immediately.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In moments, we'll be joined by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to hear what he was calling for.Plus, we'll speak with nationally recognized law professor Jonathan Turley about whether this meets the standard for a special prosecutor.But we begin with Trace Gallagher who is at our breaking news desk to walk us through these new details. Trace?  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, the Associated Press tried to get these documents three years ago but ran into a series of delays and eventually had to sue the State Department in Federal Court. After finally receiving calendars and schedules during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State, the AP focused only on meeting she had with people not associated with the U.S. or foreign governments. And here's what they found.Of the 154 people from private interests who met or had phone conversations with then-Secretary Clinton, 85 of them gave to the Clinton Foundation for a combined total of $156 million. At least 40 of those people donated more than 100,000 each. Twenty of them gave more than a million. There doesn't appear to be anything illegal about the donations, but as many point out, it certainly propagates the idea that getting a one-on-one with the Secretary of State was going to cost you. The Clinton campaign calls the AP numbers outrageous saying, quote, ""The story relies on utterly flawed data. It cherry-picked a limited subset of Secretary Clinton schedule to give a distorted portrayal of how often she crossed paths with individuals connected to charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation.""Bill Clinton says, if his wife wins, he would step down from the foundation and that it would no longer accept money from foreign groups or U.S. companies. But the Trump campaign says the pledge is simply exploiting a corporate loop-hole and would not affect donations to smaller charities tied to the Clintons. Here is VP nominee Mike Pence.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-IND., VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They're essentially saying to their foreign donors that they can make a down payment on Clinton access in the next administration between now and Election Day. And the American people are not having any of it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Experts point out that 6,000 donors have already given the Clinton Foundation some $2 billion, which, if she is elected, could lead to future potential conflicts -- Megyn.  KELLY: Trace, thank you.  Joining us now with more, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Chairman, good of you to be here tonight.REINCE PRIEBUS, CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Your thoughts on whether indeed it is time for a special prosecutor in this case and your proposal for getting around a clearly reluctant Justice Department which would be needed to have one.  PRIEBUS: Well, clearly the DOJ can't investigate itself. The FBI already recommended an investigation of corruption in the Clinton Foundation. They declined to do it. Look, she's selling her time. She was selling her time as secretary of state. So the question for the --KELLY: It's our time. It's our time. She was on the clock for us.  PRIEBUS: Right. That's right. I mean, so the question for the court is, and you're a lawyer is, is it legal to sell time as a secretary based on the size of a donation to a private foundation controlled by that Secretary of State? That's what she was doing. And it's very clear that she was selling her time.  KELLY: But you say it's very clear. Correct me -- there is an inference of it. There isn't the smoking gun. There is the Huma Abedin e-mail to the Crown Prince of Bahrain, you know, about him saying, all right, she accepts an invitation from the Clinton Foundation head to get that guy a meeting. She's like, okay, I'll take care, I got it. Right? Like I got it.   PRIEBUS: Right.  KELLY: But there's no, their point is, look, she met with a lot of people.  Some happened to have had dealings with the Clinton Foundation.PRIEBUS: Right.KELLY: And to suggest that that's untoward or pay for play is unsupported.  PRIEBUS: Well, I mean, you have to put the pieces together. Look, it took them three years to get these e-mails out there in the public. And everything points to the fact that she had people like brand and Huma Abedin, they were working as go-betweens, Huma was employed by both the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.KELLY: Uh-hm.PRIEBUS: They took anywhere from $21 million to $65 million from countries in the Middle East who have horrible records against women and gays and everyone else in between. She set up -- they helped an owner of a soccer team that helped on a visa, so he gave money to the Clinton Foundation to take care of the visa problem. I would say you have a pretty good advocate for a visa problem if you could get the year of the secretary of state to take care of your problems.  KELLY: So, to your point, this is an abuse of power. It was corrupt and an abuse of the power with which she was imbued. That she used it now to help the United State, so the American people, but she used it to help herself, to help her foundation.PRIEBUS: She used it to help herself. And they were lining their own pockets the whole way through. Then, following up and giving speeches for hundreds of thousands of dollars. What's also interesting is, look, now Bill Clinton is saying, well, if Hillary Clinton becomes president we'll going to step down from the Clinton Foundation. Well, how is that much different than being Secretary of State? I mean, not to mention the fact that they were using a private, secret server to conduct the business that she is now -- that she tried to hide from us in -- in regard to all of this information. Let alone giving away state secrets.  KELLY: Of course. But the question is whether it's going to matter to the voters. Because look, Hillary Clinton's problems with the e-mails and even with the Clinton Foundation have, to some extent, been outed already in the public. And yet still we've seen a race, Mr. Chairman, in which Donald Trump is not succeeding right now. That, you know, the Real Clear Politics average of all polls has him down 5.5 points to her. Missouri poll came out today that shows them neck and neck.Mitt Romney won that state by almost ten points. Donald Trump is down there in Texas today. What's he doing in Texas? States like Texas and Georgia, those are red states. His critics say he is playing defense in all of these states where he needs to be playing offense and she has got the better ground game. To all of that, you say what?PRIEBUS: So, let me try to unwrap all of that real quick.KELLY: Yes.PRIEBUS: Number one, he is in Texas because he is raising money just like Hillary Clinton is in California raising money. She was in Cape Cod raising money. She was, you know, obviously you have to go at times to fund-raise in places like Dallas and Houston.  KELLY: Got it.  PRIEBUS: Southern California. And that's what they're doing. As far as the polling is concerned, there was also polls that showed that Donald Trump was ahead in Iowa, he is ahead in Nevada. Yes. He has got to be consistent. And I think they know that. I think that, if he continues to be measured, continues to be prepared, consistent like he has been. He has had a great week, I think those polls are going to narrow. And I do think that Donald Trump can do that, and I do think that the polls are going to narrow.Now, back to the original part of this interview, if you had a special prosecutor and someone that was actually going to do their job and investigate whether or not there is corruption and do what you would expect our government to do in a situation like this, she is going to sink. And with -- with Donald Trump being more consistent and doing what he has been doing --KELLY: Uh-hm. I got to ask you a quick question before I let you go.  PRIEBUS: And even potentially getting back ahead like he was after the convention.  KELLY: Labor Day. Okay. So, Steve Bannon has taken over as the CEO of Trump's campaign. This is a guy who doesn't think of much of your party and has come out and suggested that he'd like to destroy the whole thing according to a report yesterday in ""The Daily Beast"" suggesting he is a leninist, that he would like to take down the Republican Party. He doesn't like parties in general. You're the head of the Republican Party. What do you think of that?PRIEBUS: Well, I never like unearned attacks. You know, we've been both on the good side and the bad side of that particular website. But look, there is so much media out there, Megyn. I mean, there are so many websites. There's so many --  KELLY: But you've seen Steve Bannon's website, Breitbart, which thinks absolutely nothing of your party and the so-called party elite. You know that.  PRIEBUS: Listen, I am not a fan of some of the things that have happened but I don't think it's been totally one-sided either. I mean, we've been on the receiving end of some good things from that particular website too.  But I think you have to judge people moving forward. And I think so far, if you look at the way things have been going for the last several days, I think it's a continuation of Donald Trump staying on message, being disciplined. He is doing it again today. I think that's where he needs to be.  KELLY: Reince Priebus. Great to see you, sir. Thanks for being here.  PRIEBUS: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: So do these new revelations about the Clinton Foundation meet the standard for the appointment of a special prosecutor?Jonathan Turley is a constitutional law attorney and George Washington University Law School professor. Professor, great to see you.JONATHAN TURLEY, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ATTORNEY: Thank you.KELLY: So, let me start with this. Do you see this as a problem?  Because, again, the Clinton campaign is saying, once again, conspiracy theories. There is no there there.  TURLEY: No. I don't think anyone can objectively look at the ""Associated Press"" report and not believe that there is a serious problem here. I mean, you have a great number of people that have business with the State Department giving money to the foundation. Some pretty disruptable (ph) people doing so. And gaining what appears to be special access. And then you have this revolving door or dual role in one case of someone who might have been employed by the foundation and State Department at the same time which, by the way, is colossally stupid to have anyone in that role.But all of that creates a foundation for these allegations of what you have, a pay to play scenario. And I think that it deserves investigation.  I think the ""Associated Press"" investigated as much as they could. They had to go to court to get the information.  KELLY: Right.  TURLEY: I don't see how anyone could deny that these are troubling disclosures.  KELLY: So, could, you know, the DOJ, they're not going to appoint a special, I mean, you tell me. Are they going to appoint a special prosecutor and could the DOJ do it itself in the investigation?TURLEY: Well, the Department of Justice has a rather abysmal record. And I'm just not speaking about the Obama administration or the Bush administration. In the last few decades, they've had a terrible record in terms of applying laws evenly to high-ranking people as they do to ordinary people. And I really don't think it's much of a record to brag about. And so they've little credibility with some people when it comes to very powerful individuals. But more importantly, this investigation -- we only have roughly a little over 70 days to the election. This investigation will extend beyond Election Day.  KELLY: So it can't get done before November 8th.  TURLEY: It very likely would not be. But then you would have some serious conflicts there, if in fact the next president is Hillary Clinton. That would tend to favor a special counsel. But more importantly, any investigation into the foundation -- and people of the FBI clearly indicated that they wanted to investigate aspects of the foundation, but any investigation is going to involve high-ranking officials and also foreign interests that are very important to the United States. I think the appearance alone says that the public interest would be served with the appointment of a special counsel.  KELLY: Uh-hm. And the odds of that happening are --TURLEY: Not high.  KELLY: Probably not high to be charitable. Professor Turley, great to see you.  TURLEY: Thank you, Megyn.  KELLY: Also tonight, Mrs. Clinton's medical history was back in the news today. And Dr. Marc Siegel is next on the health questions. Good thing he takes insurance.  Before Karl Rove and Mo Elleithee join us on how this plays with voters.  Wait until you hear their take on Hillary Clinton's health issue. That is a campaign issue.Plus, Donald Trump making news tonight with new remarks about softening his hard-line position on immigration. The fallout from that just ahead.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN HANNITY, HOST, ""HANNITY"": Is there any part of the law that you might be able to change that would accommodate those people that contribute to society, have been law-abiding, have kids here?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Developing tonight, the issue of Hillary Clinton's health back in the news today after the candidate addressed recent questions raised by Donald Trump, including ones like these.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: To defeat crime and radical Islamic terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina. Hillary Clinton doesn't have that strength or stamina, believe me.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Clinton, who sustained a concussion as secretary of state, used a little bit of humor to dismiss Trump's claims during an appearance last night on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Take my pulse while I'm talking to you.  JIMMY KIMMEL, COMEDIAN: Okay.  CLINTON: So make sure I am alive.  KIMMEL: Oh my God there's nothing there.  CLINTON: There's nothing there. What can I say. Back in October, the ""National Enquirer"" said I would be dead in six months.  KIMMEL: Oh, boy!  CLINTON: So, with every breath I take I feel like it's a --KIMMEL: You have a new lease on life.CLINTON: Yes. A new lease on life. I don't know why they are saying this. I think on the one hand it's part of the whacky strategy.  KIMMEL: Uh-huh.  CLINTON: Just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you. On the other hand it just absolutely makes no sense. And I don't go around questioning Donald Trump's health. I mean, as far as I can tell he's as healthy as a horse.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In addition to Mrs. Clinton's own defense, a number of major media outlets are now attacking anyone who attacks the health question as a, quote, ""birther,"" spreading crazy conspiracy theories. Let's take a little walk down memory lane. Back to 2008 and what some big-name journalists were then saying about then 72-year-old Senator John McCain.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is McCain simply too old to get elected?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's John McCain's health we're talking about. And he is running for the highest office in the land. His health, with limits, becomes the public's business.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a person who has had five different, now we know five different skin cancers, four melanomas. And that we found out today that he had a squamous cell carcinoma as well.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How concerned are doctors that the skin cancer may in fact return?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Dr. Marc Siegel, NYU professor of medicine and Fox News medical correspondent. And he was actually part of a team of medical professionals tapped to answer questions about John McCain's health. Doc, great to see you.DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Great to see you, Megyn.KELLY: So, I mean, those journalists were right. We had a right to know about John McCain who wanted to be the commander-in-chief and we have a right to know about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, do we not?SIEGEL: Yes, we do. And I think what happened in 2008 is we've changed the bar. We've put it in a different place. Because the public these days is all about disclosure. It's all about transparency. So, we essentially said if somebody is around 70 and they have significant health history we want to know. His last melanoma had been eight years before but 22 journalists and I was one of them looked over 1100 pages that he released to a private viewing and reassured ourselves that he wouldn't have melanoma coming back soon.  KELLY: I remember when you did that. There was something about like some sun damage on his bottom. Is that -- you can't un-see that once the image goes in your head.  SIEGEL: But I thought for parity's sake after that, we would then get full records for people that were around 70 or had --  KELLY: Okay. But neither candidate has done it. She has released more than he has. Hillary has more than Trump. He's got some letter from some doctor Harold Bornstein who says Trump will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the president. Yes. Right, thank you. And Trump says, my records show perfection. According to this guy, okay. So -- this is the situation in which we find ourselves. You tell me whether you've seen anything publicly which suggests to you she has got some deeply concerning medical condition.  SIEGEL: I don't believe that doctors should speculate. I think when we do that, we undermine our own authority and in a way it's against our oath.  What I think is if she has a significant history, like a fall in 2012 and a concussion and a blood clot outside the brain that she is now getting blood thinners on for life, I think that raises a question enough so that we would want to see more of her records if she would release them.Similarly, Donald Trump, being around 70, being 70, not sleeping well at night, and eating a lot of junk food, he readily admits, I want to see his records as well. I think a team of doctors or media people should be able to get private showings of these records, same as we did in 2008, same as - - if you asked an accountant, Megyn. You said to an accountant, how are their taxes? The accountant would say, I can't tell you. Look at their taxes. Right? Same with health records. We want to actually see the records.   KELLY: You don't want sweeping conclusions, you want the evidence that form the basis of those conclusions so you can make up your own mind.  SIEGEL: Absolutely. I don't see anything to doubt either of their candidates. I just want to see more information.  KELLY: Dr. Siegel. Great to see you.SIEGEL: Great to see you.KELLY: By the way, look what Dr. Siegel brought me back from Russia. He saw I was drinking coffee and he decided to upgrade it for me. Interesting choice.  SIEGEL: That's the best.  KELLY: Thank you. Ooh!(LAUGHTER)Thank you, Dr. Siegel.SIEGEL: Great to see you.KELLY: Joining me now with more, Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff under President George W. Bush and a Fox News contributor. And Mo Elleithee, former senior spokesman and travelling press secretary for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Good to see you both.Karl, you know, it's interesting to see everybody come out and say, this John McCain, we have got to get to the bottom of that. But now we've seen so many in the media have said, come on, lay off -- I agree when it comes to the fake medical reports that have been out there about her, but we are allowed to ask questions about her health.  KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Oh, sure. And look, in previous elections I remember in 2000 we went through this exhaustive process with the ""New York Times"" where we had to make available every health record of Governor George W. Bush of Texas. They had to be looked at exhaustively by a fellow who had done this for 20-some years for the ""Times"" and examined by other physicians.It wasn't pleasant but frankly it was part of the process. And that's been the way in most modern elections, 1996 Bill Clinton stiff-armed the ""New York Times"" for months. We knew more about the health records of Bob Dole, World War II veteran than we did about the baby boomer, Bill Clinton. But I think both candidates need to accept the fact that that kind of scrutiny -- I don't know if the ""Times"" is now prepared to do it but that kind of scrutiny is necessary in the modern campaign.  KELLY: Mo, do you agree?MO ELLEITHEE, FORMER SPOKESMAN, CLINTON 2008 CAMPAIGN: Yes. I think totally it's totally legit to want to take a look at the health records and background of candidates. And that's totally something that voters rightfully ought to have information on. And it's a legitimate question for them. Having said that, it is not legitimate to be out there spreading false stories about a candidate's health that have no basis in fact or reality.  KELLY: Okay. So, let me ask you -- let me stop you because there is some crazy right-wing, like really far, far right wing website that came up, that apparently made fake health documents for Hillary Clinton --ELLEITHEE: Yes.KELLY: -- under her real doctor's name. The doctor came out and said they're completely false, they misstated her title, I mean, they're just bogus. But let's take it a step back from that. Because you've had people like Rudy Giuliani out there saying, she looks sick. Just Google Hillary Clinton and health and you'll find -- your view on that?ELLEITHEE: Yes. That's ridiculous. And I agree with the doctor you just had on who said it does undermine the whole process. It undermines the way we look at this whole thing. I mean, the stuff that's coming out of not just far-right websites, the stuff that's coming out of -- not just out of Trump's surrogates mouths, but even some of the things that the candidate himself is saying, I think, are really unfortunate and do a disservice to this whole conversation.Donald Trump, questioning her stamina, saying that she is not mentally or physically prepared or has the stamina to do the job.KELLY: Uh-hm.ELLEITHEE: You know, look, Donald Trump, you've got a problem with Hillary Clinton. You have an issue with Hillary Clinton. You have plenty of issues to differentiate yourself on. Do it that way.KELLY: Karl --ELLEITHEE: But to manufacture something about her health --KELLY: Okay. But part of what's going on here, Karl, you tell me, is that there have been questions, in particular after she had the concussion and she had the glasses on for the double vision, and some of the comments that were made back then that raised real questions about what had actually happened to her then.  ROVE: Yes. Well, think about that. Absolutely right. She has a concussion on the 13th of December. Falls down, and has a concussion, but we're not told about it until the 15th of December, two days later. We're told on the 25th that -- excuse me -- actually got this written down.  KELLY: The white board. On the health.ROVE: White board. We're told on the 28th of December that she is going to be back to the office next week. On the 30th she is hospitalized with a blood clot but we are not told about it until the next day.  KELLY: Two pages.  ROVE: She leaves the hospital on June -- January 2nd. On January 7th, they say she is fully recovered and they have a photo op. But she is not fully recovered. On the 23rd of January, 2013, she shows up at the Benghazi hearing wearing personal prism glasses that help people who have suffered a concussion or traumatic brain injury get their vision right.  She appears on ""60 Minutes"" interview with President Obama again with the glasses. It takes over two months for her to get rid of the glasses.In fact, the next year her husband, Bill Clinton says it was terrible, the concussion required six months of very serious work to get over. That's what he admitted a year later. So when people have -- I remember when President Bush ate the pretzel and collapsed, we had to make every record available. We had to provide doctors in extremis to the press. And when she misled the American people or people on her behalf misled the American people, about the seriousness of that concussion, it does create some deaths.KELLY: All right.ROVE: Now, I'm separating that from the arguments that Trump makes about her, you know, she is up for the rigors of the presidency. People have made that argument back to John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.KELLY: Okay.ROVE: So, that's in politics. But both of these people ought to come clean with all their records.  KELLY: Mo, would you like to respond to the triple -- the triple white board?ELLEITHEE: I didn't hear it all over the sounds of the black helicopters that I think we're flying by the window here. What I think I did heard though was Karl repeating many of the things he said back in the day that he actually had to walk back, because a lot of it was -- wasn't right and wasn't true. And this is what I am talking about.  ROVE: This is absolutely true. The President -- the Secretary of State -- misled the American people --(CROSSTALK)ELLEITHEE: But Karl, the insinuation. The insinuations that you are making there, the insinuations that Donald Trump are making -- there is very little difference between the two.  ROVE: No. I'm not insinuating anything.KELLY: Nobody can understand when you talk over each other.  ROVE: No, I am not insinuating anything. I am saying her people did not tell the American people the truth about her concussion.  KELLY: Okay.  ROVE: And misled the people, delayed providing information. And then her husband admitted that it had taken her six months --KELLY: Got it. Got to leave it at that.(CROSSTALK)Got to leave it at that. We appreciate you doing the writing on your white board in something better than Dr. Scratch.  ELLEITHEE: I'll bring mine next time too.  KELLY: Whether the American people are persuaded is up to them to decide.  Great to see you both.  So, still ahead, a possible terror attack in Virginia and the questions it's now raising for the FBI. Have you heard about this?Plus, Kevin Jackson and Andell Brown are here on Donald Trump's attempts trying to reach the Black community.And then big news tonight for Mr. Trump and his pledge to deport 11 million illegal immigrants. And the softening that he is now promising on that, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, after watching Donald Trump spend the last ten days making appeals to inner city communities, we're seeing yet another shift in tone as he reaches out to another minority group, this time on immigration.Trump was speaking with our Sean Hannity just a short time ago when he revealed that he is softening what has become one of his most popular policies.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HANNITY SHOW HOST: Is there any part of the law that you might be able to change that would accommodate those people that contribute to society, have been law-abiding, have kids here?DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: There certainly can be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people. We have some great, great people in this country. So -- but we're going to follow the laws of this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: There can be a softening. Kevin Jackson is a Fox News contributor and executive director of theblacksphere.net and Andell Brown is a defense and civil rights defense attorney, good to see you both. Andell, let me start with you on that and your reaction to his statement after all this time. I mean a year plus where he's been hard-line on immigration.There is going to be a deportation force, the 11 million have to go. Their families have to go as well. There can be a softening. There is a softening.ANDELL BROWN, DEFENSE AND CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well, this is so important that Donald Trump waited until August, two months before the election to address a softening on immigration with the Hispanic-American community. I think it's too little too late. And it's really just trying a last ditch effort to reach out to Hispanic voters. His campaign has not been inclusive and I don't think it's helping now.KELLY: Kevin, his numbers with African-Americans are dismal. His numbers with Hispanics are dismal. His numbers with women are dismal. And there is an article in the ""Washington Post"" tonight talking about now he is now trying to sort of erase the impression that people have that he is, quote, ""racist"" with all three of those groups.KEVIN JACKSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think it's ridiculous that anybody would think that Trump is racist. He's taking a stance that many Americans believe. I actually think it's kind of heartening to look at where Trump is going to be in the next couple of weeks because the outreach that he's done in the black community, what he's now talking about with Hispanics, even though these are not monolithic issues, I don't believe that immigration is the only thing that Hispanics are thinking about.But I think that the fact that he is reaching out and talking about these issues and giving it a bit of a deeper dive is interesting. I think what's more funny is watching the left have a conniption because they've had a monopoly on the black and Latino vote for quite some time, and now here's a Republican who is able to reach them without the long arm of the media stopping him. So, I think it's going to be fun to watch in the next few weeks.KELLY: Andell, you know, he's reaching out not only to the Hispanic community and you know, already he's getting blowback. I mean Ann Coulter who's, he's hard line on immigration and she has been forever -- she just said the following over on MSNBC, listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How is it different than Obama?ANN COULTER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: How is it different from all the candidates he just beat? I go through. That's wanting to fight (ph)...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But he says he's going to throw out these -- deport the felons.COULTER: Well, it's very different from the actual policy. But they all say that and it just sounds very consulting. This could be the shortest book tour ever if he's really softening his position on immigration.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: She's on a book tour. She is basically saying I don't want to see that, and the question is whether this might erode some of his core support with that base he's done such a good job of cultivating.BROWN: Actions speak louder than words, and when it comes to African- Americans, black women are the leading group when it comes to college enrollment in this country, black men not that far behind. Both ahead of Trump's base of white males. We are more than poverty, crime and violence, and that seems to be all Trump can address when he's talking about black people.We're not lining the gutters of America waiting for Trump to save us. We're doing fine, and we're making progress on our own. He needs to have a better pitch than you're doing so bad, how much worse can it get. We need him to tell us what he's going to do and to address the issues.KELLY: Kevin, he referred it that he was talking about yesterday and said what the hell do you have to lose to the black community. Like come with me, vote for me. But you got to give him some credit for reaching out to these groups, do you not? I mean, he obviously is struggling with African- Americans and with Hispanics.BROWN: That's the best he could come up with?KELLY: He's trying.JAKSON: Megyn, great sound bite.BROWN: ""A"" for effort for Trump -- participation trophy.JACKSON: Of course Trump would say that because he's exactly right. He's exactly right. The Democrats have effectively ruined the black community. Look, there are a lot of things going on that are great in the black community. The problem is...BROWN: What is he going to do to fix it? That's the question.JACKSON: And the problem is, is that when you talk about things like black neighborhoods, you shouldn't even be saying that things like black neighborhoods, black schools. We all know what that implies. These are the worst of the worst. When we look at criminality, when we look at jobs, all of it is bad, it's all under Obama and it's all in big cities run by Democrats.So, Trump is exactly right to bring this to the fore because you know what, Democrats believe that blacks are the sacred cows that are going to come to the barbecue and eat like everybody else. It's time we barbecue the sacred cow and Trump is actually making an impact. And I will tell you...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: The internal polling in the Trump campaign shows that he's got an opportunity.BROWN: ...worst than the worst. It's what Trump is about. He's appealing to a different base. He doesn't care about black people's votes.KELLY: Well, the internal polling appears to show that there is some room with the African-American voters because many are dissatisfied with the Clinton policies on crime...BROWN: Donald Trump has nothing.KELLY: I got to go. Great to see you both. So the key question in the race is this. With 76 days left, 76, can you believe that? I know. And Hillary Clinton holding a lead in the swing states, what does Mr. Trump need to do to catch her? Is it historically possible? Some answers next.Plus, a possible terror attack in Virginia by a man who was on the FBI's radar for months. Have you heard about this? We'll investigate how this happened in moments.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As far as we can tell, there was no connection between the victims and the suspect. They have never see him before. It appears to us to be a random attack.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File,"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: Breaking tonight, 76 days to go until the 2016 election. And Hillary Clinton is ahead of Donald Trump by more than 5 points in the Real Clear Politics Average of national polls. Plus, a new poll from Virginia tonight has the Democratic nominee with a 19-point lead in a state where the two candidates were tied just three months ago.Joining me now, the publisher and co-founder of the best website on the internet, RealClearPolitics.com, Tom Bevan. Tom, great to see you. Nineteen. I mean, the bottom line is, if she can win Virginia and North Carolina, he can win Florida and Ohio, and he could still lose.TOM BEVAN, REALCLEARPOLITICS CO-FOUNDER AND PUBLISHER: Correct. I mean, I think for Trump it all starts and ends in Florida. If he can't win Florida, it's over. Beyond that he's got to win -- he has to keep North Carolina and the Republican column, which Mitt Romney did barely in 2012 and he has to win Ohio and Pennsylvania.And that will get him there. He doesn't have to win Virginia necessarily, but look, we are seeing Clinton's lead in some of the states balloon. You mentioned Virginia -- Colorado is the same thing. Pennsylvania is now over 9 percent in RealClearPolitics average there so, and even Florida and Ohio are now in the 5 percent range, Clinton leads. And so Trump has lost ground and he...KELLY: OK, but that's -- that's actually -- that provides some of the context of what we have been discussing in the show which is an evolving Donald Trump on certain issues and a softening on some of his core positions in an attempt to reach out beyond that core base, which he points out would never leave him but if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue, right.So, that's what's going on. But you tell me historically whether somebody who is -- where Hillary is -- has gone on to lose in this country, you know, this close to the election.BEVAN: Well, certainly if you go back and look at the 2000 election, Al Gore came out of the conventions there with a 7 point lead in the Gallup poll. In October, Bush had taken a double-digit lead in that poll and went on to basically -- he won the election but lost the popular vote by 500,000 votes, so.I mean, we do have examples in history where people have made up ground. Gerald Ford for example in 1976, was down 15 points after his convention and end up losing but only by two points. But the problem for Trump now, in the post 2000 period where the country is so evenly divided and we're much more polarized and partisan now, are there that many persuadable for Trump to win back at this point with only 11 weeks left. That remains an open question.KELLY: And yet, there may be some big event. I mean, there could be, God forbid, there is a terror incident or this e-mail dump, you know, from the DNC involving Hillary Clinton. I mean, there could be a game changer still.BEVAN: So many unique things about this election, Megyn, or events. We have two candidates now who are the most -- least well liked in history on honesty and trustworthiness and a whole lot of other things. Donald Trump, Republicans have never nominated someone without a lot of experience other than a war hero. So, there are just a lot of potential vulnerabilities and twists and turns I think left in this race.KELLY: What would you give -- where would you put the odds? What percentage would you say Trump has of winning at this point?BEVAN: I mean, look, given where things stand right now, he is behind the eight ball. I mean, he's got to start making up ground. He's guys are making...KELLY: Try to put a number on it for me. I won't hold you to it but as of this point in time.BEVAN: You know, given where things stand right now, I would say maybe 25- 30 percent. I mean, think he's still -- again, even despite all the things that have happened he is down 5 points in the national average. That is something that -- it's not like he's down 10 or 20 points nationally.KELLY: Yeah. They don't -- the voters don't like her either. I got to go. Hard break. Tom Bevan, great to see you. Up next, a terror attack that no one has heard about? That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: After days of attacks from Donald Trump, President Obama today finally made a trip down to Louisiana to survey the damage from flooding that began nearly two weeks ago. Trump was earlier suggesting it was too little, too late and doubling down on his suggestion that president Obama should have cut his vacation short to make this visit. But the president was suggesting his trip was about more than a photo opp.(BEGINN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Even after the TV cameras leave, the whole country is going to continue to support you and help you until we get folks back in their homes and lives are rebuilt. And the reason I can say that with confidence is because that's what Americans do in times like this.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: For more information on this story and how you can help, go over to our website, which is foxnews.com.Well, we are also tracking developments tonight from Virginia where the FBI is investigating a possible ISIS connection after a brutal stabbing in Roanoke, Virginia. The suspect, by some accounts, attempted to travel to Syria and was on the FBI's radar screen. So, how exactly was he able to carry out an attempted stabbing? Trace Gallagher has the latest, Trace?GALLAGHER: Megyn, the FBI knew about this guy but he had no criminal history. And so far, ISIS has not claimed responsibility for the attack, but investigators are looking into whether it was ISIS-inspired. It happened in Roanoke County, Virginia, about 250 miles south of D.C.A man and woman walking into their apartment complex when they were ambushed by a man with a knife screaming Allahu Akbar. Both victims were severely wounded including a neck wound to the male victim, though authorities do not believe it was an attempted beheading. The man was able to fight off the attacker. Now listen to the 911 dispatcher.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Caller is advising there's blood everywhere. Male is attacked -- people -- there's blood everywhere. A knife in the stairwell. Going to be a traumatic injury, two patients, one with a neck laceration, the other with a leg laceration.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:Aa man matching the description of the suspect later walked into the same hospital where the victims were taken. He was arrested and identified as 20-year-old Wasil Farooqui, who reportedly has been on the FBI's radar for months and is believed to be self-radicalized. Investigators say Farooqui traveled earlier this year to turkey and may have tried to sneak into Syria.Police say both victims are Muslim, but they do believe the attack was random. The FBI is now looking at Farooqui's computer and his social networking footprint to see if there was been any contact overseas. Farooqui is being held without bond tonight, Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you. Joining me now with reaction, Dana Loesch, host of ""Dana"" on the The Blaze TV and Nomiki Konst, executive director of The Accountability Project, great to see you both. So, this is not clear, Dana, right? They're saying maybe he was mentally disturbed. That's the most likely explanation according to the investigators. But how do they get there if people heard him yelling Allahu Akbar and he was on the FBI's radar?DANA LOESCH, HOST, ""DANA"" ON THE BLAZE TV: Yeah, that doesn't quite make sense, Megyn, and I agree. I think that we're still learning some things here but at the same time, there are too many coincidences that make me quite uneasy. The fact that you had multiple witnesses that said he was screaming Allahu Akbar as he was slicing and dicing these poor victims here. The fact that he had traveled recently to Turkey hoping to gain entry to Syria, was unsuccessful.And as you said, the FBI had him on some sort of list, had been watching him for at least a few months. All of this stuff adds up. There are too many coincidences here. And when you look back at some of these other not so lone wolf, you know, it goes back to the question how many lone wolves make a pack?When you look at some of these other previous attacks, there have been these kind of red flags that have been in these criminal -- attackers' past, whether they've been traveling, what their browser history was like, some of their associations, and I'm sure those are all things that the FBI in their investigation, they're going to come out with.KELLY: Well, certainly if he attempted to travel to Syria, you know, the FBI is going to be interested in that, Nomiki. But if he's, you know, what he apparently said was he was hearing voices telling him to attack people which could take this out of terror and into a straight mental health situation. I suppose that's why they're not labeling it anything right now.NOMIKI KONST, ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: Right. And the Department of Justice actually did a study and released a report saying that the majority of these lone wolf terror acts are actually acts that are related to mental illness. So I think...KELLY: So it's both. It could be both.KONST: And I think that's the problem with ISIS, unlike Al Qaeda or some of these traditional terrorist organizations that have these large structures, is that ISIS feeds off of the weak. It feeds off of the young people who are naive, don't understand the implications of going to Syria, and a lot of westerners who have been marginalized, and the mentally ill unfortunately.And they have access to information. They have access to their propaganda online. And while this guy may have been not -- not been trained by ISIS, did not go to Syria, he could use it as a tool.KELLY: Well you know, a lot of people are going to be wondering why if he was on the FBI's radar, how he was able to commit an attempted stabbing.LOESCH: Yeah, I agree with that too Megyn. And I think you do have to be mentally ill to be part of ISIS or to be an Islamist, an Islamic terrorist. But at the same time, it's going to be easier to try to get off on a crazy charge than a terror charge.KELLY: Right, so might as well lead the foundation early about the voices, which may be real, maybe not. We'll be right back. Thank you, ladies.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Tomorrow on ""The Kelly File,"" Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, which released those hacked DNC emails right before the democratic convention, and they say more emails are coming related to the Clinton campaign.
