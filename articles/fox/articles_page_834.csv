This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We can't blow the movement. We have to make sure we get a big mandate. We have to go out. Tomorrow, we have to go out and vote.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The week before Iowa, every pundit on TV, every pollster on TV, said there's no way we could win. The one thing they forgot was the voters.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And that's going to be the consequences if Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton wins. If they win, all the policies Barack Obama has put in place which have damaged our country become permanent.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Safe and sound from the campaign trail today, back here in Myrtle Beach as we take a look at the real clear politics average of polls heading into tomorrow's first in the South Primary. Donald Trump still with a big lead here, 13 and almost 13 and a half over Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and there you see the rest of the field.Let's bring in our panel from Washington. Charlie Hurt, Political Columnist for The Washington Times. Chuck Lane, Opinion Writer for The Washington Post and Syndicated Columnist Charles Krauthammer. These are the three Charles panel. I like to call it the Chuck Wagon. We're coming up with new names. But, gentlemen, thanks for being here.Set the table for us, Charles Krauthammer, about -- you look at the polls, you see what's happening on the ground. How South Carolina sets up tomorrow?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, I think the odds are that Trump is going to win, probably big. That's expected. I think the real key is going to be, what is the distance between the third -- the one who comes in third and the bottom three if there is a big spread, in other words, if you get Trump, Cruz, Rubio in that order.And then, the bottom three are in single digits. That, I think, would be a seminal event because if the races are three-way race and it really is a toss-up, who at the top three would get it? If it remains a six-man race, a five-man race, that means that Trump will ramp all the way to the nomination because he will dominate if the so-called establishment vote splits. So, that's the real issue.Will South Carolina we know the way we expect that we get in New Hampshire but which New Hampshire did not?BAIER: You know, I want to, Chuck Lane, listen to this back and forth with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz with a new line of attack by Cruz on Israel.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: To make lasting peace there, probably the toughest deal of all but I'm going to give it a shot. Let me be sort of a neutral guy. Let's see what -- I'm going to give it a shot. It would be so great. I would be so proud if could I do that.CRUZ: As president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel, if am president, because I am not neutral between terrorists who are blowing up and murdering women and children and the people of Israel who are trying to defend their nation.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: OK, Chuck?CHARLES LANE, WASHINGTON POST: Well, there's a lot of support for Israel among evangelicals, evangelicals are a key bloc for which these two men, Trump and Cruz, are really competing hard in South Carolina. So, Ted Cruz pounced on that little word neutral.And by the way, even the idea of neutrality or even handedness is not what you'd expect from Donald Trump who's always sort of, you know, positioning himself as Mr. Belligerent, the guy who will take on our enemies and stand up to this and stand up to that. It was an off-key note and moment for him and Cruz completely pounced on it.Of course, you know, whether he's get -- really got what it takes to outpace Trump at this point or not, I don't know. But I think what he's really trying to do is avoid coming in third as Charles suggested and to do that. Again, he's got to keep a lot of evangelicals on his side.BAIER: And Charles, I talked to a lot of voters today. Some of them in that peace, there were a few who said they would never vote for Trump but there's a lot of support here on the ground for Donald Trump when you talk to people around the state.CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES: Yeah. And I think one of the big problems for Donald Trump is that he has done very well in the expectations game in terms of the polls.And so, you know, if he does win by a double-digit margin in South Carolina, that's a tremendous victory. But, he probably is not going to get the credit in the media that he would like. We remember in Iowa, he came in second place. Marco Rubio was very much viewed as the winner there, at least between the two of them.The other thing that I'm kind of interested in watching, though, is the battle between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. You know, history is littered with candidates, double candidates who, you know, get into a fight under the leader and turn it into a murder-suicide. And, you know, Rubio and Cruz have to be very careful about that because they're going hotly negative.BAIER: OK. It's Friday. We go to a place on Friday called the Candidate Casino. And this is special time because we just started this looking back at Candidate Casino's past, for this particular panel, take a listen.LANE: Again, my first time. And I'm going to place an initial 25 chips on Jeb. I've 30 bucks (ph) on Scott Walker for probably obvious reasons and 15 on Marco Rubio, and the rest spread out among the field.KRAUTHAMMER: We got the top three, Bush, Rubio, Walker, and we have the three outliers, Cruz, Trump, Kasich.LANE: Well, I have $30 on Donald Trump. This is new for me. I had been skeptic but I finally caved to the reality.KRAUTHAMMER: Trump on top, 35. Cruz is number two, obviously Rubio. And my long shot is Christie. And then, to console myself, it's wine, women and song again.BAIER: Well, we didn't have the Charlie Hurt tape but you can see the evolution, Charles Krauthammer from the beginning to now.(CROSSTALK)KRAUTHAMMER: The evolution is that I've doubled the wine, women and song. I'm now up to 10 months on that. I've got Trump, Cruz, Rubio in that order. Rather close together. A lot is going to hinge on tomorrow. Again, if the field is winnowed, then I think it's a toss-up of the three of them. If it's not, then Trump remains the prohibitive favorite.BAIER: Charles Lane?LANE: Jeez, Bret, you know, and they say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. But in Candidate Casino, they bring up your past and they throw it in your face.Look, I'm saying $35 on Trump, because as I said in that clip, I capitulated. My second is Rubio, a $30 on the theory that that's a bet on his being able to finally end up one-on-one with Trump and kind of gathering all the anybody but Trump forces, then I got Cruz.And I'm sticking $10 on John Kasich because I think he is the one guy you really can't eliminate in South Carolina even if he finishes in the bottom three because he's still intent on playing Ohio and Michigan.BAIER: We're going to get the tape, Charlie Hurt. So, talk slowly here. But, who are your bets?HURT: Well, just to be clear, I paid somebody to burn all of mine. But -- so right now, I have Trump, 75, and in between Rubio and Cruz, I give Rubio 15 and Cruz 10 only because I think the establishment is -- ultimately will get behind Marco Rubio big time. And, that is a powerful thing and it gives him some edge.BAIER: The three Cs, Charles, Charles, Charles, or Charlie, Chuck and Charles, thank you very much.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BARBARA BUSH, FORMER FIRST LADY:  Jeb has been a great son, great father, great husband, married well, and is one of my four favorite sons.  (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  She has a great sense of humor.  And I always wonder, the popularity of the Bush family, no more so when it comes to Barbara Bush, but, of course, Barbara isn`t running.  It`s her son Jeb Bush.  And he is in a world of hurt right now in the polls in the Palmetto State and elsewhere.On the phone with us right now, former Republican presidential nominee back in 1996, Senate Republican leader as well, Bob Dole.  Senator, so good to have you back.  How you doing?  BOB DOLE, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Doing good, Neil.  How you doing?  CAVUTO:  I`m fine, sir.  There has been a bit of a confusion here that you were maybe veering away from Jeb Bush and looking at others.  I think Marco Rubio`s name came up.  So, where do you stand?DOLE:  I am 100 percent for Jeb Bush.  And you can study their records.And the best qualified to be president -- and that`s what we`re electing -- is Jeb Bush.  And, you know, he has all the qualifications.  He`s been around a couple of presidents.  He knows his way around.  He knows his foreign policy.  So, I`m for Jeb Bush.  And I`m looking for a South Carolina surge.  CAVUTO:  If he doesn`t see a surge, Senator, what then?  DOLE:  Well, I don`t know what the next state is.  CAVUTO:  Well, I guess a lot of folks there when it comes to Jeb Bush point to Florida.  It`s a do-or-die battle between he and Marco Rubio, obviously favored sons, even though that is a state that Donald Trump could win.  What do you think of that?  DOLE:  Well, I -- you know, I have -- I really believe in Florida that Jeb Bush is going to win.  He was a great governor.  And, you know, he was tested with, I think eight, hurricanes in 16 months. And he`s appointed thousands of women to high- paying jobs.  I mean, he has a great record.  And he`s the only one I know of who spelled out programs in every area, including Social Security, tax reform, health care, and national defense.  CAVUTO:  Well, no, he definitely has detailed policy positions.  It hasn`t helped him a lot in the polls, but it could change.  You`re right.Let me ask you, though, then.  I don`t know how you feel about this battle back and forth between Donald Trump and the pope.  Whose side are you on?  DOLE:  Well, I would say I`m neutral, but I don`t think the pope should have been, you know, talking about American politics.  And he truly had Trump in his sights.  On the other hand, the pope is right in talking about helping the poor and helping others in need.  And I think the press kind of -- if you read the script, it`s not really that bad.  CAVUTO:  Yes.  If you read -- you`re right.  If you read the Italian version of what he said, it`s a little different.But it is what it is.  He did seem to say, that is, the pope, that there are some times that Donald Trump appears, in his views, for example, on building a wall, to be less Christian-like.  Do you think that that hurts Donald Trump or helps Donald Trump, whatever your own personal political preferences -- I know you just said you like Jeb Bush -- in a state like South Carolina?  DOLE:  Well, there`s a wall around the Vatican.  (LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Yes.  You`re right about that.  You`re right about that.  DOLE:  So, no, I don`t think it hurts Donald Trump.  I think it`s kind of one-day story.  CAVUTO:  Yes.  DOLE:  It`s gone, and it demonstrated again that Trump can control the news, as he did all day over that story, and he`s pretty good at it.  CAVUTO:  Yes, you`re right about that, Senator.  I want talk about your thoughts on Ted Cruz.  When last we spoke, and you expressed more reservations about Ted Cruz certainly than Donald Trump at the time.  And I talked to a lot of Cruz folks right afterwards, sir, who said, well, that`s our next campaign commercial right there, the RINOs, that is what they were kind of intimating you were, Republican in name only, Mr. Establish, that the attacks he got from the Bush family and the rest, that if that isn`t a sign that he is a compelling -- that is, Senator Cruz -- compelling new force, than someone like Bob Dole saying what he did about him is pure magic to us.  What do you say?  DOLE:  Yes.Well, I think I don`t know what he said about me.  I know what he said about me earlier.  He ridiculed me and McCain and Romney because we weren`t right-wing extremists like himself.  CAVUTO:  Well, what he was saying is that you were, all three, good men all, ultimate losers in the general election.  (CROSSTALK)DOLE:  ... didn`t say that...CAVUTO:  Go ahead.DOLE:  ... quite that way all the time.  CAVUTO:  So, it is your sense that he overdid it with those attacks?  And I think your argument was, Senator that if a President Cruz got in, forget about reaching across the aisle.  He would have more -- a lot of trouble with his own side of the aisle.  Right?  DOLE:  He doesn`t have a single Senator supporting him.  And if that doesn`t speak volumes to the voters in South Carolina, if you have 64 friends, and you`re 64, and you want help from the other 63, you want to do something, you`re going to get it.  But he doesn`t has -- they don`t like him.  And he`s self-absorbed.  He has got this giant ego.  And he`s overly ambitious.  He entered the Senate as a Canadian citizen.  So, I don`t know.  I just never been -- I thought I was a conservative, but I worked for Ronald Reagan for four years as the leader, and I think behind Jesse Helms and another one, I was the third highest supporter of Ronald Reagan.  So, I told Cruz he ought to check our voting records before he starts making remarks.  CAVUTO:  Let me know next time how you feel about Senator Cruz.  But let`s say, in the end, Senator, he is the nominee of your party.  Would you support him?  DOLE:  Oh, yes, certainly.  CAVUTO:  OK.  Just wanted to be clear on that.  You know, I want to get your thoughts on a good friend of yours, Antonin Scalia, passing away.  He`s lying in repose in the Supreme Court now.  Both you and he had exchanged good, funny barbs.  He had a good sense of humor.  You were not too shabby on that front.  Much was made of the fact that the president paid his respects today, is not going to the funeral.  Is that much ado about nothing to you?  Should the president go to the funeral?   Inconsistent protocol on this.  What do you think?  DOLE:  Well, Joe Biden knows -- knew Scalia very well, because he was chairman of Judiciary Committee and a Catholic.  CAVUTO:  Right.DOLE:  I don`t know why the president`s not going.  I mean, I think, if I were there, I would go.  But I can`t -- you know, I don`t know what made the decision.  So, Justice Scalia, you know, was -- when I ran for president in `96, he was considered as my running mate.  CAVUTO:  I remember that.  DOLE:  Yes, and probably would have been a good one.  CAVUTO:  That`s interesting.  I think you settled on a guy named Jack Kemp.Real quickly, if I can, I mean, this dust-up over whether the president, too, should go ahead and name a successor, Republicans in the Senate should have confirmation hearings, where do you stand on this?  There are many in the party, Mitch McConnell, say, maybe we don`t hold those confirmation hearings.  Maybe we wait until a new president.DOLE:  Well, I think Grassley, who is chairman, Senator Grassley, who is chairman of the committee, has a little different view on that.CAVUTO:  He does.  You`re right.DOLE:  And he wants to have the hearings.  CAVUTO:  Do you?  Do you?  DOLE:  And if he wants to have the hearings, there will be hearings.  Now, whether or not there will be anybody reported out of the committee is something else, but -- because it would take, I think, Grassley to join the Democrats.  But, you know, we don`t have to wait too long.  We`re -- 11 months isn`t long, and they`re split 4-4.  CAVUTO:  Right.DOLE:  And some of these cases will go back, and there are not too many cases coming up.  CAVUTO:  So they can wait, you think?  DOLE:  Yes, I think they can wait.  You know, we`re not...CAVUTO:  OK.  DOLE:  It`s not the end -- it`s not a big -- it`s going to be a campaign issue, because, obviously, Democrats will say one thing, and we will say another.  CAVUTO:  Yes.  That`s the way it goes.  Senator, always an honor to have you on.  Thank you very much for joining me.  DOLE:  Good luck tomorrow.  CAVUTO:  All right.  Well, we`re going to be busy.  Senator Bob Dole, a pleasure.One of the titans of the Senate, an iconic Republican figure, Bob Dole.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
