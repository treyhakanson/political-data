This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST:  Breaking tonight, the raging political firestorm over choosing the next Supreme Court justice gets hotter as President Obama weighs in on the fight.  Good evening and welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly.  Just hours ago, President Obama stepping to the microphones and for the first time personally addressing the death of Supreme Court icon Justice Antonin Scalia.  The president saying that he will nominate someone to replace the late Justice Scalia, saying the nominee will not necessarily be a moderate.  The president also lashing out at critics, berating Republicans who say they will not even consider the President's potential nominee.  Mr. Obama telling GOP senators to do their jobs and rise above day-to-day politics.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now.  When there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, the president of the United States is to nominate someone.  The Senate is to consider that nomination.  There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off years.  That's not in the constitutional text.  I'm amused when I hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the constitution suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  However, we heard a very different message from Barack Obama and his Democratic colleagues when George W. Bush was president.  We'll bring you that piece of history in a moment.  Also tonight, we take a closer look at the life and legacy of one of the greatest legal minds in modern American history, Justice Antonin Scalia.  We are joined tonight by a man that new Justice Scalia as a colleague, judge and friend.  Judge Ken Starr is here and then in his first interview since his father's passing, Antonin Scalia's son, Eugene Scalia, is with us tonight.  But we begin with Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, who is a senior member of the Judiciary Committee which is responsible for considering the President's Supreme Court nomination.  Great to see you, Senator.  So, Barack Obama back when it was Justice Alito, Samuel Alito being proposed to the U.S. Supreme Court had a very different view of what he now says this whole process of confirming nominees, and what he said back then as he filibustered that nomination.  It wasn't just a no vote, it was a filibuster trying to decline a vote on this justice.  It was very different from what we heard today, which was today he said Supreme Court nominations are different, and we all understand they're different and they have to be treated with the respect they deserve.  Your thought.  SEN. JEFF SESSIONS, R-ALA., JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Well, he's been totally hypocritical and inconsistent on that.  Justice Alito is a fabulous judge, he did a great job at the judiciary hearing and he filibustered and tried to deny him having a vote.  There is no doubt that by following what Mitch McConnell, our leader, Republican leader has said, we are not going to bring this nominee up this year.  He's doing exactly what Harry Reid would do if he were in the majority at this time.  I've seen these fights, I've seen them go on for quite a long time.  Mitch McConnell used to serve on the Judiciary Committee.  He understands this completely.  So we're just not going to move this nominee because it's going to allow the next president to fill this seat.  It's a decisive seat on the court.  We've lost a great conservative, brilliant justice that will be impossible really to replace, but so I think the American people will be able to elect someone and that person will get to make the nomination.   KELLY:  You know, Mitch McConnell sounded very different on this issue too.  There is hypocrisy on both sides but when you look at folks like Chuck Schumer who has completely reversed himself on the appropriateness of confirming Supreme Court nominees in an election year, he didn't want it to happen within 18 months of the presidential election, never mind 11 months where we are now.  And then listen to Senator Pat Leahy, here he is first in 2006, he's a colleague of yours in the Senate, he's a Democrat, and then listen to him today.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. PAT LEAHY, D-VT.:  The Thurman rule in memory of Strom Thurmond, he put this in when the Republicans were in the minority which said in a presidential election year after spring no judges would go through except by the consent of both the Republican and Democratic leader.  We will institute the Thurman rule.   (END VIDEO CLIP)SESSIONS:  Well, there is no such thing as the Thurman rule.  The fact of the matter is a Supreme Court justice, let's have a vote.   KELLY:  I mean, Senator, this is ridiculous, it's ridiculous.  So to those who are home saying, I don't know, I don't trust any of these politicians but when there's a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, it's almost a year before we get the next president, why wouldn't you Republicans allow the president a hearing and give this person at least an up or down vote, what say you?SESSIONS:  Well, I think it's the -- the President has had two confirmations to the Supreme Court, two very activist judges in my opinion that don't allow -- don't maintain their fidelity to the words of our constitution and laws and I don't think he's entitled to have a third one at this late date.  As a matter of fact, the tradition is not to confirm someone in the last year and as Pat Leahy, when he chaired the committee, has chaired the judiciary committee for many years, he just refused time and again to move nominees.  They never got a hearing, they never got voted on, many withdrew as time went by and they couldn't get a hearing.  So he's certainly -- so what we're talking about in this case is so important that the American people should be the one to decide which direction the Supreme Court will go.   KELLY:  Senator Sessions, I've got to go but I have to ask you very quickly, in the presidential race on the GOP side, are you endorsing anybody yet?SESSIONS:  I have not endorsed anybody yet.  I am watching it with great interest.  It is an exciting event for sure.   KELLY:  As are we.  All the best to you, sir.   SESSIONS:  Thank you.   KELLY:  Well, within one hour of the news that Justice Scalia had died, a man who served our country faithfully for decades some far left journalists took to twitter celebrating and mocking his death as his family is still in mourning.  Trace Gallagher has that from our West Coast Newsroom tonight.  Trace.   TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, to many on the right, Justice Scalia was a hero, a conservative stalwart who supported gun rights, the death penalty and tough immigration legislation.  His opposition to gay rights, abortion and ObamaCare made him a villain on the Left.  And though his passing was treated respectfully by most of the media, even death couldn't conjure respect in some far Left journalists. Rolling Stone's David Ehrlich posted this tweet, quote, ""So, if the news about Scalia is true, how long do we have to wait until we can openly not be sad about it?""  The managing editor for The New Yorker Magazine Silvia Killingsworth tweeted, quote, ""Wish I could be a fly on the wall for Scalia's chat with the devil.  Died in a ranch in Texas, God bless America.""  The writer Glenn Greenwald wrote, quoting again, ""Don't even try to enforce the inapplicable don't speak ill of the dead rule for the highly polarizing, deeply consequential Antonin Scalia.""  And the senior style editor for Cosmopolitan.com said this, quote, ""The devil is back in hell!  Yay!""  And while critics are not surprised by the tasteless tweets of those they consider  the fringe, they were surprised by this headline in one of the country's most influential newspapers, ""The Washington Post"" that boldly reads ""Supreme Court Conservative Dismayed Liberals.""  On that our senior political analyst Brit Hume weighed in with this tweet quoting, ""Remarkable Sunday headline morning after news of Scalia death.  Just remarkable.""  Others called it a helpful guide to how The Washington Post views the world -- Megyn.   KELLY:  Trace, thank you.Joining us now with some perspective on Justice Scalia's legacy and the impact of his death on the court, Judge Ken Starr, president and chancellor of Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and member of the faculty of Baylor Law School.  Judge Starr has argued 36 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court including before Justice Scalia as U.S. solicitor general.  He also served as a U.S. Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia and he is the author of ""First Among Equals: The Supreme Court in American Life.""  Judge, great to see you.  Thank you so much for being here tonight.   JUDGE KEN STARR, BAYLOR UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT AND CHANCELLOR:  All right.   Thank you, Megyn.   KELLY:  I don't want to dwell on the hate that we just had recounted there, I'd rather go to the love and somebody who gets it.  Who is associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who could not have been more opposed to Justice Scalia ideologically.  I mean, right, they were on totally opposite sides of the spectrum but she came out and wrote the following just as one example.  ""He was a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit with a rare talent to make even the most sober judge laugh.  It was my great good fortune to have known him as a working colleague and treasured friend.""   Your thoughts.  STARR:  This is a great tradition on the judiciary that you can disagree, you can disagree pretty vehemently and you can like one another.  You can even love one another as friends and that's the way it was with Ruth Ginsburg and Alito Scalia.  And those of us who admired the core has celebrated that.  So, it's so unfortunate, it's tragic to see the ugliness and the death of civility yet again.  But the court is very strong and it will survive this, but we're going to be in for some very rough sledding.  But in terms of Justice Scalia's legacy, so much has wisely been said that he was a great friend of the constitutional structure.  He believed in we, the people.  He felt that we, the people should govern through the elective process and so he was very respectful of legislation.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.STARR:  At the same time, he was very protective of individual rights and I think this is being lost in the conversation.  He was one of the most vigorous proponents of freedom of speech.  He was a great advocate in the favor of our freedom as free people to not be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures and the right of confrontation in the Sixth Amendment.  He was a very zealous protector of fundamental constitutional rights.   KELLY:  That's the thing is when our report that you just heard from our reporters talked about how he was against abortion or against gay marriage, that's not quite right.  He was against judges legislating from the bench on those issues.   STARR:  Exactly right.  He wanted there to be a great national debate, and frankly a debate within the states that marriage, for example, traditionally entrusted to the states.  So whatever his individual views were, he tried to set those aside and really to follow what he viewed as the overriding message of our constitution.   KELLY:  Yes.   STARR:  Which is let we, the people, decide.   KELLY:  He didn't like judges wearing robes sitting from the bench trying to understand how people in Middle America see these issues, and he wanted those issues returned to them.  So let me ask you as somebody who's obviously knows much more about the Supreme Court than any of us, what is likely to happen now?  How do you see this battle shaping up?  First of all, do you think the Republicans are in the right to refuse to consider a nominee?  And second of all, what do you think is likely to happen with all the cases pending before this high court over the next 11 or so months?STARR:  Well, it would be great if everyone could get together and say here is a consensus nominee.  Maybe a generation ago that could have happened.  But since the nomination of Robert Bork, it's been very, very ugly and so it's rare for someone like Scalia --  KELLY:  Which is something the Democrats did to the Republican nominee of President Reagan.   STARR:  Well, that's exactly right.  And so it's very unfortunate.  So failing that, then, it's a matter of power.  And what we're seeing is the President is exercising his power and now we see the Senate exercising their authority, their power to say we're simply not going to do this.   Now, I will add this.  I think it will be unfortunate for the court for a nomination and a confirmation hearing to be caught up in presidential politics.  That's one person's view.  I think the court as an institution will be better, even though it's a little rough sledding when you've got eight members of the court and not all nine.  Yes.  There will be some decided judgments, four to four, affirmances, that's really unfortunate.  KELLY:  Yes.STARR:  But when you consider the alternative -- the alternative in light of the polarization of America and what we're seeing in the presidential campaigns is really very ugly.   KELLY:  Judge Starr, it's great to see you.  Thank you for coming here tonight.   STARR:  Good to see you, Megyn.  Thank you.KELLY:  Also tonight, somber new pictures from inside the U.S. Supreme Court right here.  You can see the section of the bench directly in front of the late justice's chair draped with black wool, part of a tradition dating back nearly 150 years.  On Friday the justice's body will lie in repose in the Supreme Court's great hall.  It is a solemn honor for a man who is remembered for loving life and laughter.  Here now in his first interview since his father's passing, Justice Scalia's oldest son, Eugene Scalia, a respected attorney in his own right.  Eugene, thank you so much for being here.  Our condolences on the loss of your father.   EUGENE SCALIA, SON OF FORMER U.S. SUPREME COURT ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA:  Thank you.  Thank you, Megyn.  Thank you for having me.   KELLY:  How do you think you and your family will remember him and how do you think he would want us all to remember him?SCALIA:  As I think you've heard others say, he had such a breadth of character.  He was one at the same time an extraordinary, intelligent person obviously, but very funny.  He loved opera on the one hand and hunting on the other.  We certainly in our family, the children and my mother, remember his humor, his warmth, his example.  He was my father.  KELLY:  This is the two of you.   SCALIA:  That's right.  That's a picture of my law school graduation.  And some in our family age more gracefully than others, but that's right, my graduation from law school which was obviously a very important moment for me to have my father there with me.  In terms of how others might remember him, you've had Senator Sessions and Judge Starr talk about his legacy as a judge, which is very important to our family.  He had a very strong view of the role of the court and role of the constitution.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.SCALIA:  The court's importance, but also its limited role and hopefully that's a lesson that he will bequeath to the country.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.SCALIA:  I hope you don't consider me selfish in saying that we like to think that part of his legacy is us.   KELLY:  His nine children.   SCALIA:  His nine children.  And he was very proud, as my mother is very proud of their 36 grandchildren.   KELLY:  He had a great sense of humor and we talked a bit about, you know, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and how much she loved them even though they were so very different.  They had sat on a lower court together and she used to talk about how she would react when she read his dissents, you know, which were just always so biting and awesome and strong and fun to read and she'd talk about how as annoyed as you might be about his zinging dissent, he's so utterly charming, so amusing, so sometimes outrageous, you can't help but say, I'm glad that he's my friend or he's my colleague.  Do you think, you know, knowing your dad as you did, do you think he would, do you think he'd be caring what others are saying about him, and do you think he'd be caring about the nasty press or any of these remarks we've gone through?SCALIA:  I think he got used to that.  So, let me say, first of all, that what has really struck my family and me and meant so much is all the wonderful things that have been said about our father over the last few days, including by Justice Ginsburg, who was a very close friend, among others.  It's meant a great deal to us.  You know, what we've suffered is what everybody suffers eventually, losing a parent, but to have so many people saying so many wonderful things is a special blessing.  We certainly appreciate that.  And the prayers as well.  In terms of what people are saying about his jurisprudence, like I said, he kind of got used to grief on that.  And what he cared about was the opinions that he wrote and joined.  And getting it right as a judge.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.SCALIA:  And that's what mattered.  And I don't mean to be disrespectful in saying that whether people agreed with him or not in the media or elsewhere wasn't really important to him.   KELLY:  Eugene, I'll tell you a funny story before I let you go.  I was a young reporter covering the Supreme Court and I idealized him as a brilliant legal mind.  You know, we of course read all of his opinions and decisions when we were in law school.  And I saw him as Chief Justice Rehnquist's funeral that I was covering for FOX News.  And he was walking right over to me and I thought, oh my God, this is him, I'm actually going to meet him.  Maybe he's seen my coverage, maybe he knows me from FOX News, maybe he's going to say that I get it.  Right?  And he comes right up to me and he says, Miss, would you please take a picture of me and this man right here, here's my camera.  (LAUGHTER)Oh, wait, this isn't that moment at all.  But you were the lucky one, his son, and yourself a brilliant lawyer.  In fact people say that Gene may even be smarter than Antonin Scalia was, which is saying something.  Thank you for spending the time with us tonight.  SCALIA:  Thank you.  Thank you, Megyn.  KELLY:  All the best to you and your family.  You see that, I mean, think about that.  Think about that Ginsburg-Scalia relationship and what message that could send to our country.  Look how they did it.  Scalia used to say if you can't get along with a colleague despite the fact that you have these deep disagreements, get another job.  And you know, you could take that, you could extrapolate that to a lot of situations in our country today.  Good for them, a true public servant.   And while this court fight is already a hot issue in the campaign trail, the focus today was Iraq and Donald Trump's allegation that President George W. Bush knowingly lied about the war and knew in advance about 9/11.  Up next, a range of reaction from three men who put their lives on the line in defense of America.  Plus, as we head into the South Carolina primary, conservatives are all over the road on where this race is going and FOX News senior political   analyst Brit Hume is here on what that means for the coming weeks.   Plus, Judge Andrew Napolitano weighs in on the potential lawsuit that could change this entire race.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We will bring a lawsuit if he doesn't straighten his act out.  He's a lying guy, a really lying guy.   Some people misrepresent, this guy is just a plain out liar.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake.  George Bush made a mistake.  We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty.  We should have never been in Iraq.  We have destabilized the Middle East.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But so, I mean, so you still think he should be impeached?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it's my turn, isn't it?TRUMP:  You do whatever you want.  You call it whatever you want.  I want to tell you, they lied.  They said there were weapons of mass destruction.   There were none and they knew there were none.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  That was Republican front-runner Donald Trump at Saturday night's debate attacking former President George W. Bush in remarks that have provoked a whole lot of controversy.  Radio host Mark Levin put it this way.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK LEVIN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  The fact that he attacked George Bush as a commander-in-chief, not because he disagreed with him but he attacked him as a liar who knew there were not weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and said he was responsible for 9/11 and he was responsible for those to towers coming down, this guy sounds like code pink, sounds like a radical kook!  I know too many Gold Star families who lost sons over there.  To hear this 9/11 truther crap, which is pretty close to it, pretty damn close to it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Today it would appear Mr. Trump tried to soften his stance on the former commander-in-chief, at least a bit.  Listen.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I don't know if he lied or not, I just know there were no weapons of mass destruction.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Three men who served our country join us now.  Retired Staff Sergeant Robert Bartlett is an Iraq war veteran.  He was seriously injured by an Iranian bomb.  Michael Waltz is a former Green Beret who had multiple deployments to the Middle East, and served as a Vice President Dick Cheney's special advisor for South Asia and counterterrorism.  And Carl Higbie is a former Navy SEAL who did two deployments in Iraq.  He is a Donald Trump supporter.  Gentlemen, thank you all for being here and thank you for your service.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you.   CARL HIGBIE, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Thank you, Megyn.KELLY:  So, you know, let me start with you, Sergeant Bartlett.  Donald Trump comes out and says, it was a lie, that President Bush lied and got us into the war in which you served us.  And your reaction to that.   ROBERT BARTLETT, RETIRED STAFF SERGEANT:  You know, I joined after what happened.  When we were staging outside of Kuwait, that's when I joined.  I joined because I knew Saddam wouldn't back down.  It sounds like Trump is taking all of his points from the Liberal media in the past instead of using his research analysis or subject matter experts and that's why his comments are what they are.  The problem is that his comments hurt people.   They hurt people who served over there.  They hurt the families that served over there.  Take into consideration that his words are affecting those 22 veterans we lose a day to suicide.  You know, what does it do to them?   Those who are on the edge you know that are already struggling.  We don't need a second president who's already -- a second president blaming Bush, we've already got one.  KELLY:  Carl, let me get your thoughts on it since you support Donald Trump.  And I mean, what do you make of these comments?HIGBIE:  Well, I'm a huge supporter of Donald Trump and I don't think most vets that I know, at least the overwhelmingly majority that I've spoken to support Donald Trump because we believe in his conviction.  We strongly believe that he will do as he said.  He is so centric on veterans issues.   Look, I mean, look at this guy.  He skipped the debate and, you know, he threw a veterans event where he raised $6 million.  This guy cares more about vets than any of the others guys on stage.  On one side you have Hillary Clinton who says, it's sexist if you don't vote for her and then she's married to the biggest sexiest in politics, and you have Bernie Sanders who would have been thrown in jail during the cold war for his policies and then you have the rest of these whackos on the Republican stage who have voted for a living with our tax dollars.  And you have someone like Donald Trump who's gone out there and given his own personal money to help veterans.  I mean, this is a guy that all veterans should get behind, not be offended.   MICHAEL WALTZ, FORMER GREEN BERET:  Megyn?KELLY:  Go ahead, Mike.   WALTZ:  Megyn, I'm sorry.  Here is a guy in Donald Trump, I'm offended, by the way.  Here's a guy who went to prep school --  HIGBIE:  You're a big boy, you'll get over it.   KELLY:  Let him finish.WALTZ:  Hey, calm down there SEAL -- that went to prep school, said he was in the military, dodged the draft, insulted a POW, and John McCain a true hero.  And I don't think Donald Trump can withstand a day of what John McCain went through for five years.  And then insults 43 and blames him as commander-in-chief.  The man who built the very security and intelligence apparatus that eventually led to the killing of Osama bin Laden and kept us all safe all to score points against Jeb Bush, who, by the way, led the Florida National Guard through multiple national disasters, has been endorsed by 40 admirals and generals, 12 medal of honor winners and put the only detailed plan that I know of forward to defeat ISIS rather than just saying let's bomb the crap out of them.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.WALTZ:  If I'm sent into combat again and I'm still in the reserves, I want to be sent in by a steady hand, a thoughtful hand, an experienced hand in the Oval Office, not a sound bite celebrity guy.  It scares me for me, my men and my children.   KELLY:  All right.  Let me get Carl to respond.  Go ahead, Carl.   HIGBIE:  Well, I think that you know, you make some valid points with your concern should be addressed, but the fact of the matter is, Donald Trump is going to get the lawyers off the battlefield.  And the concerns you have where he blamed Bush for now, he didn't blame Bush for now -- Mark Levin tried to say he blamed him for now.  It did happen on his watch.  And did we find, what, WMDs?  No.   WALTZ:  I'm sorry.  Donald did not know what the nuclear triad was.  He doesn't even know what the nuclear triad is.  And you advocate his finger being on the nuclear button.  He's called Putin an ally and he doesn't even know our nuclear response and the components of it --  KELLY:  Carl, do you, let me ask you this --  WALTZ:  -- the three components of it.  He should do his homework.  KELLY:  But let me ask you this.WALTZ:  I'm sorry, but we can't afford -- we can't afford another President who begins learning the job on day one like President Obama did.   KELLY:  Carl, you seem to be accepting that Trump was not -- was not putting any blame on George W. Bush for 9/11.  Then why did he keep saying that it happened -- he said it happened under his reign, which of course our president is not a king.  It happened on his watch.  But why did he keep saying that?  Are you suggesting he wasn't trying to blame the President?HIGBIE:  Well, Megyn, blame him or not, on your program you've always been committed to truth.  And the truth of the matter is, it did happen on his watch, I have a measurable respect for George W. Bush.   KELLY:  Right.  But why raise that?  What is the point that is being made if not to put some blame on him?HIGBIE:  I think the point was trying to be made that he's setting himself apart, you know, he's setting Jeb apart from his brother, he's also saying that the war in Iraq was a mistake.  We fought it poorly.  I think we went in there with no plan --KELLY:  OK.HIGBIE:  And we went in there --  KELLY:  All right.  I want to get back to Sergeant Bartlett who actually -- who did fight there and received, you know, some terrible injuries and is still out there fighting the good fight for the First Amendment and for the military and for many other things.  Sergeant, your thoughts on how this primary at this point in South Carolina, which has a lot of military in it, seems to be dividing the Republican field in a way we haven't seen in prior elections.  The Republicans usually stand united and not quite this divided when it comes to the military.  BARTLETT:  Yes, I agree.  I think it's the temperature of the water.  We're seeing now how Republicans have made mistakes in the past.  How they have been divided in the past and what it's led to, what the problem is. Nothing can get done in Washington and the people are unhappy. They're not -- they're blaming the Republicans, they're -- they're blaming the Democrats and nobody is doing anything. They're saying a lot of things, but they're not doing anything. Let -- so let's choose .(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Let him finish.BARTLETT:  . let's all well - so let's choose a president that picks good subject matter experts, that has good policies. If we're all talking about policies here, let's put policies .UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.BARTLETT:  . on the measuring table. Let's look at everybody's policies on how they look. I don't want to hear two Republicans fighting over what the past was. The past doesn't matter at this point. It's where we are right now and what we do with it.Now, that's great that Trump supports the troops. I commend him for that. I'm on the board of nonprofits trying to stop veteran suicide, so I appreciate that. But let's not use it as a political football where we're tearing each other apart. Let's talk about each other's policies and then defend your policies on the public arena. How about that?Don't sit there and blame some past president for what they did. You won't know until you're in that seat, so don't act like the president now, act like the president you're going to be. Don't -- don't use the talking points of the president now is using. Use your own talking points with your policies and then prove it. And maybe they .(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Right.  I -- I got .(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Megyn, I think -- I think .(CROSSTALK)KELLY: . I wish we had more time.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: . the soldiers deserve better.KELLY: May I just say that I respect all of you for being here and for your service. Thank you very much.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Megyn.BARTLETT: Thank you, Fox.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Well, just days before the South Carolina primary and conservatives are deeply divided on the road ahead for the GOP field. Our Fox News senior political analyst, Brit Hume, is just ahead on what this means.Plus Marc Thiessen and Charles Hurt (ph) here on nasty turn in the Republican race and whether we are headed for a brokered convention. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking Tonight, just four days to go until the South Carolina primary, and a new poll from American Research Group finds Donald Trump maintaining his lead in South Carolina, although Marco Rubio is gaining a bit in the poll followed by Cruz, Kasich, Bush and Carson. This poll taken entirely after Saturday night's debate, which had some of the most vicious attacks we have seen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: For most of his life, his policies have been very, very liberal. For most of his life, he has described himself as very pro-choice and as a supporter of partial birth abortion.TRUMP: You probably are worse than Jeb Bush. You are the single biggest liar(CHEERING FROM THE CROWD)All right. This guy lied -- let me just tell you. This guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa, and he just continues.CRUZ: Donald has this weird pattern, when you point to his own record, he screams liar, liar, liar. If you want to go .(CROSSTALK)JEB BUSH, R- PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me. It's bloodsport for him. He enjoys it, and I'm glad he's happy about it. But I am sick and tired .(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Who spent $22 million on this .BUSH . I am sick and tired of him going after my family. My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind.(APPLAUSE)And while -- while Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe.CRUZ: Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama's illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office. I have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action, including that one.(CROSSTALK)(BACKGROUND NOISE -- CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)CRUZ: . on the question .(CROSSTALK)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: First of all, I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish. And second of all -- the other point that I would make .(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: (SPEAKING IN SPANISH)(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: This is -- look this is a disturbing pattern now because for a number of weeks now Ted Cruz has just been telling lies. He lied about Ben Carson in Iowa, he lies about --(BACKGROUND NOISE -- CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)-- he lied about marriage, he's lying about all sorts of things.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Marc Thiessen is a Fox News contributor and former speechwriter for President George W. Bush. Charles Hurt is a political columnist for the Washington Times. Guys, good to see you both.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER SPEECHWRITER FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Good to see you, Megyn.CHARLES HURT, POLITICAL COLUMNIST FOR THE WASHINGTON TIMES:  Good to see you.KELLY: Let me start with you, Charlie, whether you think, you know, all this back and forth about he's a liar, he's a liar, liar, liar, nasty guy, and it wasn't just Trump using terms like that. You -- they -- they all seem to be getting down in the gutter. Is it turn-off for Republican voters?HURT: Well, to be certain, it's entertaining, and I think that it is -- it's not just reporters who find it entertaining. You know, the numbers that we have seen tuning into all of the Republican debates have been historic and I think that a lot of that has to do with the unpredictable nature, in particular of Donald Trump.  And yes, sometimes it gets a little ugly, it gets a little nasty, but you know -- you know, politics has always been a fairly rough and tumble store - sport in America.KELLY: Yes.HURT: And more people tuning in for whatever reason is not a bad thing. I think, it's probably a good thing, but obviously, Megyn, you're exactly right, there are -- there are definitely those people who look at this and their stomach turns and they don't really .KELLY: I don't -- I mean --HURT: -- want to watch anymore.KELLY: -- I'll say this, we had about a million fewer viewers than CBS did here at Fox News when we didn't have Trump in it and that debate was not quite as nasty. So, maybe there were -- maybe there are a million viewers who, you know, wanted to see that.But, you know, the nastiness on the other hand, Marc, in South Carolina in particular is expected, like that -- that kind of like that's what we've been told like that's how it's going to go in South Carolina.THIESSEN: Yeah, there's a saying that former GOP chairman of the state says that in Iowa and New Hampshire, they expect to see you in person. In South Carolina, they want to see you take a punch. South Carolina is a state that where -- where the politics are down and dirty. So, we expected to see nastiness in South Carolina. But I think there's a qualitative difference between some of the nastiness.What we did not expect to see is the GOP front-runner for the presidential nomination of the Republican party standing on a debate stage and spouting conspiracy theories about 9/11 and whether Bush lied about WMD.KELLY: Yes.THIESSEN: That is very different from saying you're a liar, you're lying about my record. What he is saying -- these are not things that reasonable people can disagree on. They're -- they're conspiracy theories. They have been disproven. When I was at the White House, Megyn, every day there were people outside the gates in Lafayette Park banging on drums, chanting Bush lied and people died.I never in my life thought that I would see the leading GOP candidate for the president of the United States saying that from the debate stage in South Carolina.KELLY: Yes. Well, that's what Mark Levin was saying and -- and Medea Benjamin of Code Pink out today and said, she thought it was fantastic. She loved listening to Donald Trump say that stuff.  So -- so the GOP front- runner and Code Pinker on the same page, but the thing is, Charlie, people -- you know, pundits may say, ""Oh, that's, you know -- but Trump's numbers are -- he's more than double.Rubio or like Rubio is going up at 16, Trump still got more than double of what he does. They -- they -- they don't care and South Carolina is an open primary. So, Trump may be doing a smart play by getting in some non- conservatives there into the tent even though he's winning with conservatives, too.HURT: And I think another thing that he's doing, Megyn, is that he is taking a very -- a very important question to -- to Republican voters right now, and that is does the Republican Party want to continue with the Bush dynasty? And polls show that -- that voters do not want to continue with the Bush dynasty and a big part of the Bush dynasty has been things like the war in Iraq.  And -- and it doesn't mean that the -- that the voters don't like George W. Bush.  It -- what it means is they're -- they get -- are getting a little tired of these -- of these wars.KELLY: Yes. Marc, I'll give you the last word.THIESSEN:  Well, that's not what he's doing. What he's doing is spouting conspiracy theories. What he said was that George W. Bush knew about 9/11, was warned before it happened, didn't stop it. He was told -- he knew there were no WMD in Iraq, and he lied to the American people to start a war. That is very different from litigating whether we should have gone into Iraq or not. Reasonable people can disagree on that. There is no reasonable person who can defend what Donald Trump said.KELLY: What's amazing is there was so little talk about what happened under President Obama's watch when, you know, Vice President Joe Biden said, Iraq was going to be a great success story for the administration and then we left no troops behind in Iraq, and it went to hell but the -- but the blame was very much on -- on the shoulders of GWB -- George W. Bush at least on Trump's view on Saturday night. Guys, thank you both.THIESSEN: Thanks, MegynHURT: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Also tonight, Judge Napolitano is here on the threatened lawsuit that could change this race for president. Plus Brit Hume is next on the chaos heading into South Carolina.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new questions about the state of the Republican Party, as many conservative voices struggle to come to grips with the front-runner, they refuse to accept and talk of a brokered or contested convention continues to surface.Joining me now, our Fox New senior political analyst, Brit Hume. Brit, good to see you.  So, what you have is Trump dominating in the polls in -- in South Carolina as well, and yet when you look at his national unfavorables, they're sky-high and you appear to have two-thirds of the Republican Party that wants nothing to do with Donald Trump but is likely to see him as their nominee if things keep going the way they're going.BRIT HUME, FOX NEW SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, he's certainly on kind of a roll here, Megyn, and the win in New Hampshire gave him a lot of input is coming into South Carolina where he was already ahead. The latest polls taken since that debate, that brawl on Saturday night, suggest that he has not been harmed by his performance in that debate, widely criticized though it was, and that his lead is basically holding.However, if you add up as you suggested a few minutes ago the number, the -- the number of votes or the amount of percentage of support for -- you take any three of that -- that group of four who are basically vying for the same space in the race, which is to say Kasich, Bush, Rubio and Cruz, it well -- it well surpasses the support going to Donald Trump. But if this keeps up, Megyn, and he continues to win these primaries with these pluralities in the mid-30s or -- or -- or about in the mid-30s, and we get to the point later on a month or more from now when we're beginning to have the winner-take-all races where if you win by, you know, you get 34 percent and win by one percentage point, and you get all the delegates.KELLY: Yes.HUME: He'd be on his way to simply taken the nomination easily. And that, of course, worries Republican leaders and worries a lot of conservatives.KELLY: And these guys in the establishment lane, you sort of have the Trump lane, you have the Cruz lane, you know, true conservative lane, that was -- the cramp -- the Cruz, and then the last lane, which is the establishment guys, none of whom believe that -- that they're out. They all believe that they -- they still have a shot. And so if they ...(CROSSTALK)HUME: Well in .(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  . if they don't -- if they -- if they .(CROSSTALK)HUME: . what .KELLY: . if that doesn't work out soon, Britt, their, you know, their chances get weaker and weaker.HUME: Well, the situation is this. Rubio or Kasich or -- or Bush are all fighting basically for the same voters. And you add up their support, it's pretty substantial, but as long as they're still in the race, nobody is going to do very well .KELLY: OK.HUME: . against Trump and possibly even against Cruz, although I think Cruz is fighting for many of the same voters as well. So, that's one more problem, and if that lane doesn't clear and Trump is running against, you know, a group of other candidates who are dividing up the opposition to him or at least they're all fighting for the same support, you know, he's got a clear path and that obviously is worrisome and they worry -- the great -- deeper worry they have is because of the negatives that you mentioned about him that you cited is that if he were nominated, he would be crushed in a general election.And moreover, more than that, they're worried that if he somehow became president, that he would be unrepresentative of their party and would be an inexperienced, temperamentally unsuited leader to hold that job and would be, therefore, not an effective president. And so this is -- this is a party, which is to some extent in crisis about this, although -- although the -- although there's no real panic yet. It could come, though, later.KELLY: Do you think there's a chance of a brokered convention or contested?HUME: Well, I think it's -- remember this. There are about 400 delegates who are party officials or party leaders who are not -- who are free to support whomever they want. You need about, oh, more than -- a little more than -- about around 1,200 delegates to win. If it's close between Trump and somebody else at the convention and he doesn't have a majority of the delegates. Those votes could swing in a direction that would give the nomination to somebody else. But somebody has to get very close and that so far hasn't happened yet.KELLY: Yes. that's the thing, and so while the other candidates who divide that two-thirds of the vote, Trump is sailing right through to the nomination which is fascinating to watch. Brit, pastel (ph) Brit, you know, we love to see you.HUME: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: We have -- yeah. OK, so up next, you may have heard that Donald Trump has threatened to sue Ted Cruz over whether Cruz is eligible -- eligible to run for president. Does he actually have a case? Judge Napolitano has the answer next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, Donald Trump renewing his threat today to sue Ted Cruz of whether he's eligible to run for president unless Cruz apologizes to Trump for allegedly lying. Fox News Judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano is with us now and this lawsuit has how much chance?ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Zero. There are many, many technical obstacles to this lawsuit but in this of a political campaign, for him to say to his opponent, ""Unless you apologize to me for something you said about me and to Ben Carson for something you did to him, I'm going to sue you. The federal courts would dismiss the suit on their own motion and charge Donald Trump the cost that the others paid to resist the suit."" It's called frivolous pleadings. This is litigation 101.KELLY: So, this is a -- this is a judge speaking and this is a judge who loved the other judge we talked about at the top of the hour, Justice Antonin Scalia who you knew well.NAPOLITANO: It was one of the greatest privileges of my life that I got to become his personal friend and I want to say colleague because we spent many times together in front of audiences, debating and agreeing and disagreeing about the meaning of the Constitution. It was everything his son described. He was in private the same way he was in public, loud, large, witty, bombastic, funny, self-effacing, fiercely Catholic and absolutely traditionalist.KELLY: Like another judge we know.NAPOLITANO: Oh!(LAUGHTER)KELLY: Great to see you.NAPOLITANO: You made my night.KELLY: Condolences on the loss of your friend.NAPOLITANO: Thank you.KELLY: We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Do you think the Republicans should a vote an on President Obama's Supreme Court nominee?

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning.More protests and growing tensions following the murders of five Dallas police officers.Hi, everyone. Welcome. I'm Maria Bartiromo and this is ""Sunday Morning Futures.""Dozens of cities on alert this morning as large crowds take to the streets.  How are police officers responding following the heartbreaking week in Dallas?Joining us this morning, former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, Texas Congressman Pete Sessions, Wisconsin Sheriff David Clarke, and Bill Johnson, head of one of the largest police unions.Plus, Attorney General Loretta Lynch gets set to testify this week in the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. We will hear from the former director of the FBI on James Comey's testimony last week, along with Congressman Darrell Issa, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" right now.The attack against Dallas police officers putting police in cities nationwide on high alert, this as protests are erupting for the fourth straight day this morning following the fatal shootings two of black men at the hands of the police in Minnesota and Louisiana. More than 200 people arrested as some of the protests took a violent turn.There have also been more attacks against officers as well as a threat against the Dallas Police Department this morning. We look now at how law enforcement and the communities they protect are coping with this growing unrest.Joining me right now is Ray Kelly. He is the former New York City police commissioner and the vice chairman of K-2 Intelligence. He is also author of the book ""Vigilance.""Commissioner, nice to have you on the program this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.RAY KELLY, FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: Good to be with you, Maria.BARTIROMO: My condolences and the country's condolences to you and your former colleagues there. What has happened in this country?KELLY: Well, it certainly has been a terrible week of violence. There's been a lot of vitriol felt by a lot of people directed at the police. Then we saw the terrible carnage on the streets of Dallas as a result of that vitriol.So, hopefully, we can get back to some sense of normalcy in the days and weeks to come, but it's been a very difficult time for police officers. I think you saw the best of the traditions of U.S. policing by the Dallas police force reacting when those shots were fired. Yes, their colleagues were struck down, but they ran into the face of fire to rescue them. And I think it certainly made me proud, and I know everyone else in law enforcement thought they did a great job, in spite of this horrific carnage.BARTIROMO: You and I have spoken in the past about the so-called Ferguson Effect, where police officers have changed their approach to crime. Do you see that persisting right now? What would you say is the difference in terms of the approach that police officers are taking today versus several years ago.KELLY: Well, let me say this, I have never seen police officers, I'm not seeing it today, back away from any emergency situation. But I do think there's been a hesitancy as far as discretionary acts are concerned, things that are referred to as proactive policing. Yes, the police have backed off from that. They're concerned about their jobs. They're concerned about being criticized. But in terms of responding to emergencies, there's no backing off at all.BARTIROMO: And you've seen so much throughout your career, from the time you first became a cop. What can you tell us in terms of how the police force has changed?KELLY: Well, it's changed tremendously. Back in the '60s, of course, we saw major riots in New York City. We had very few minority officers. Now you see diversity spread throughout the country, you see African-American chiefs in charge of major city police departments. We saw Chief Brown, we see Superintendent Johnson in Chicago. In two weeks, we're going to have conventions, in each of those convention cities the chiefs are African- American.I think community policing is working in some locations, but right now it's a dangerous time for police officers. And the shootings in Dallas I think showed the vulnerability of all officers. That shooting, let's face it, could have happened anywhere, just because this individual lived near Dallas that it happened there.So, it's a tough time to be a police officer, but they're going to stick together and still going to get the job done as far as emergency and as far as serious crime is concerned.BARTIROMO: I want to cover a couple of things. In terms of the approach and the way the police officers' jobs may change, we've spoken in the past about body cameras, about new technology that has come into the situation to assist those trying to protect the country. What do you see in terms of changes and how the police force might look different?KELLY: Well, I think body cameras are here to stay. Some departments have embraced it. Others are a little bit more reluctant. But probably in five to seven years, you'll see that as a standard piece of equipment.I think that's a good thing, because you'll see these YouTube videos that will cover an incident and start midway through it. Now, we'll have the opportunity to look at the entire event as it happens, and I think it will show so much beneficial good heroic work that's done by the police throughout the country.BARTIROMO: What do you -- what do you want to see in terms of leadership?  Commissioner, everybody I speak with says the same thing -- we need leadership, we need someone to bring us together, we need people to understand what all of the people are feeling. What would be that leadership change?KELLY: Well, I think we need leadership that tells it like it is. I think we need to change in policing. I think we need better educated officers.  I think we need more scenario-based training so officers are encountering situations in the police academy and not on the street.And quite frankly, we need leadership in minority communities. There's way too much crime in communities of color. Police contacts, even though African-Americans are 13 percent of the population, they're about 30 percent of the police contacts throughout the country. We need to see a major push to reduce crime in communities of color.BARTIROMO: You mentioned the conventions that's coming in the next week.  You've got the Republican convention beginning on Sunday and then the Dems' convention beginning a week later. Are you expecting heightened violence at these conventions?KELLY: Well, I think there will be major demonstrations. Whether or not they develop into violence I guess remains to be seen. There's been a lot of planning, a lot of training. Secret Service has led that in both Cleveland and Philadelphia.Again, there's been a lot of harsh words spoken. We'll see what happens.  I think they're pretty well-prepared for it, but it's going to be a challenge, no question about it.We had a convention in New York in 2004, and we had the largest demonstration ever at a political convention. And ultimately, it all worked out.BARTIROMO: You know, this morning we're reading headlines of Black Lives Matter protest planning across the country, scores of protesters arrested overnight in Minnesota, again. We're seeing such vitriol. What should people take away in this moment of uncertainty, in this moment of lawlessness?As a leader in your community, what do you think the people should be thinking about on both sides, whether it is someone upset with the police or someone in the police upset with the people?KELLY: Well, look, our country is based on First Amendment principles. We want people to demonstrate, to voice their opinion, we want them to do it responsibly and peacefully, and that's what leaders should be talking about.And I think the police will continue to do their job. As you said, all over the country, we see these demonstrations, but all indications are they're being well-policed. And certainly, the police have reason to be anxious these days after what we saw last week.So, we want responsible leadership to speak about and address the issues of responsibility and only -- only doing the right thing and not embarking on violence with police. It gets us absolutely nowhere. I've seen progress, certainly, in my time, as I said, but that progress is based largely on communication, on speaking. If both sides sort of separate and are not talking, we're going to be in for, you know, for a hard time.BARTIROMO: Commissioner, thanks very much for weighing in this morning.  We appreciate it.KELLY: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon. Commissioner Ray Kelly joining us this morning.We're learning new details this morning about the shooter behind the Dallas shootings. Did he have a larger attack planned?Plus, how is the community responding? Up next, we talk with Congressman Pete Sessions.Hope you follow me @mariabartiromo, @sundayfutures. Let us know what you'd like to hear from Congressman Sessions, as well as our guest later on in the program. Jim Kallstrom coming from the FBI.This is ""Sunday Morning Futures."" We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Police in Dallas and across the country on edge this morning following the brutal ambush that left five officers dead last week as well as last night's anonymous threat against Dallas law enforcement. We're also learning that the shooter, Micah Johnson, might have been planning a much larger attack than the deadly assault he carried out in Dallas.Congressman Pete Sessions of Texas is with us, whose district includes Dallas. He is joining us right now to talk more about it.Congressman, thanks very much for joining us.REP. PETE SESSIONS, R-TEXAS: Maria, good morning.BARTIROMO: Set the stage for us in terms of the scene in Dallas right now.  Are emotions still on edge? What can you tell us in terms of how people are feeling right now?SESSIONS: Thank you very much.In fact, the Dallas community has a number of circumstances, as you allude to. First of all, the Dallas community has come out in strong support of our police department that is one of the finest in America, a police department that was doing the right thing.Second, every single police officer in the days following the shooting have reported for duty. They are ready for duty. They are proud of their department. They are working together.Number three, yesterday there was this anonymous threat against the department. It was on lockdown most of the afternoon and again this morning. The police officers, the police chief and many people in the police department are under increased threats from people in the community who still harbor a bit of hatred.This morning, our major African-American churches, there is a live discussion going on. Commissioner Kelly spoke about how all communities need to have a discussion, an open discussion. Our mayor, one of our leading state senators from the area, is directly at an African-American church having a live discussion with the African-American community about the resolve of this community for their lives not only to be important and to matter, but the responsibilities that come with that. We need a police department.Fourth, I think it's plain to say that there were lessons that were learned from this effort and some which we will be able to effectively manage and some which is going to require the public. Jim Kallstrom, deputy director of the FBI, will tell you most importantly, you have to have the public that understands why it is important to have safety. And officers are there to protect citizens.BARTIROMO: Right.SESSIONS: But officers are there with a duty, and I think that's the fourth lesson that we're going to have to listen to and we've got to be good at it.BARTIROMO: And, Congressman, that communication becomes that much tougher during times of mourning, as we send you our condolences as well this morning.SESSIONS: Yes, ma'am.BARTIROMO: What can be done on a practical level in terms of that communication? What are the messages you'd like to get across to the people?SESSIONS: Well, the messages first that I would like to get across is that as we look at these issues as they have taken place around the country, there is not necessarily one single factor. Yes, I'm aware that there was a weapon that was used, but if you look at Chicago, which is the gunshot capital of the nation, they already have strong gun control laws. What is similar in these circumstances, it perhaps is a weapon, but it's the underlying feelings of people and the population that we need to talk about.What about Chicago? Chicago is home to a thriving $3 billion drug trade.  These are gang wars at each other.BARTIROMO: Yes.SESSIONS: We see circumstances that happen in other places, whether Louisiana, Houston or Dallas, and it is people who are trying to, I believe, do the right thing and run into trouble.Our law enforcement must be effective. They are there to protect law- abiding citizens. But we've got to have people understand that police need better training. You heard Commissioner Kelly say this -- better urban- like training.BARTIROMO: Right.SESSIONS: We do not have those facilities today, military-grade Kevlar helmets and vests. Many departments do not have this. They have Kevlar, not military grade, the next generation.BARTIROMO: Yes.SESSIONS: Our police officers in Dallas, Texas, had to march down the center of the road to draw fire to see where this shooter was coming from.BARTIROMO: Right.SESSIONS: Heroism.But they need the resources as well as ammunition and guns that can fight in an urban setting against these kinds of circumstances.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's a really important point. So, we don't know anything else about a larger attack than the assault carried out in Dallas that he is suggesting.SESSIONS: Well, we don't.BARTIROMO: Yes.SESSIONS: We don't. But what we do know is that he had a number of plans, evidently, under way, including a bomb-making, literally, factory in his own home, books that were teaching him how to do it, as well as all of the supplies that were handy.So, I don't think he thought he was going to get away from this. He was willing to fight. But the bottom line is it could have been much worse.BARTIROMO: That's true. Yeah. Congressman, thank you very much.SESSIONS: Yes, ma'am.BARTIROMO: We appreciate it, Congressman Pete Sessions.A top law enforcement group is calling for the feds to investigate the Dallas shooting as a hate crime. We'll talk about that and whether it's a real possibility as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A top law enforcement group, the Fraternal Order of Police, is asking the Justice Department to investigate the killings of five Dallas police officers as a hate crime, but there could be a hurdle, because the Justice Department's definition of a hate crime does not include acts against the police. Just before Micah Johnson was killed by police, he told them he, quote, ""wanted to kill white people,"" especially white officers.Joining me right now is Bill Johnson. He's the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations. Also joining the conversation by phone is Sheriff David Clarke of the Milwaukee County Sheriffs Police Office.Thank you so much, gentlemen, for joining us.SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY, WI (via telephone): My pleasure.BILL JOHNSON, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF POLICE ORGANIZATIONS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Bill Johnson, let me get your take first off in terms of identifying this as a hate crime.JOHNSON: Well, certainly there's a lot of hatred evidence against the officers themselves. I think the attacks that we're seeing upon police all across this country is a hatred of police in general, regardless of the color of their skin. The happenstance, the murders in Dallas, the man who committed the murders has already been dispatched to meet his maker and to be judged, so I think it may be late, unfortunately, there.But I do think that the Department of Justice and the president has to affirmatively act to protect police going forward, and we've been incredibly disappointed all across this country -- officers are disappointed -- in the lack of leadership, the lack of public support, the lack of equipment, the lack of trust that the president and the attorney general have evinced in their treatment of police.BARTIROMO: Because the president's words are strong words, and that sets the tone for the entire country.Sheriff Clarke, do you agree with that? What are you seeing from your standpoint?CLARKE: Here's what I see. I think there's an elephant in the room that too many people want to talk around. It's where we go when we're dealing with these deadly encounters between young, black males and police.And I think it's a good time to transition back to what the real problem is and just ask yourself, what leads to so many instances of interactions between young, black males and police in urban centers? It's crime. Who are police after? Criminals.Ask yourself, who is overrepresented in involvement in violent crime?  Young, black males. Now, that may be an ugly truth, but it's still the truth. But too many people want to focus on changing police tactics and police behavior, something that I believe works, by the way.Nobody wants to talk about the flawed lifestyle choices and behavior of too many young, black males, things like gang and drug involvement and weapons violations. Those things are going to increase the risk of a deadly encounter. But no one wants to ask, where are the dads, where are the fathers? Instead, we go after the low-hanging fruit. Too many people want to attack the police.So, if people want to look at this thing -- and the police issue might be part of it, but it's a small part of it -- everyone wants to dismiss or ignore that elephant in the room, these pathologies in these urban centers.BARTIROMO: Right. And, Bill Johnson, we heard from the president earlier this week from Warsaw, and he's headed to Dallas this upcoming week. You say you're disappointed in what the president has done in terms of setting the tone and bringing us together. What do you want to see from him?JOHNSON: Yes, the president has called for a truthful discussion, a frank discussion. And yet, he perpetuates this myth, this lie, that these protests are peaceful. The attorney general keeps referring to the protesters in Dallas as peaceful protesters.Yet, everywhere these groups go, attacks and shootings and murders of police officers follow in their wake, whether it was Ferguson, Missouri, New York City, Baltimore, Maryland, and now Dallas. At some point, if we want to have an honest conversation, you have to realize that these are not peaceful protests, they never were. They march around calling for the murders of police officers.And yet when it happens, everybody acts as if they're shocked. Like, how could this had happened?Responsibility has to come from the very top. It has to come from the presidency. And to have groups like this protesting and saying that we want to tell you how you ought to run your local government or police department, but they can't even control their own rallies, it's insane.The men and women are out there today, as congressman pointed out, they're still doing their jobs this morning. They get up and go to work. They're threatened, shot at all across the country, San Antonio, Dallas, Georgia, St. Louis, just in the last couple days, but they still do their jobs. And that's, I think, what has to be recognized.BARTIROMO: So, what can the president say, Sheriff Clarke, from your standpoint, on the ground, in the thick of things, in the police force?  What can this president say, do you believe, to underline Bill Johnson's point there?CLARKE: He should say nothing. Every time he opens his mouth, he fans the flames of this antipolice sentiment that is sweeping the country in some of these urban centers. He reminds me of a pyromaniac who sets a fire, then calls 911 for the fire department and then returns to the scene to watch the fire department have to put out the fire.Look, Dallas is on fire. Many of these cities, Chicago, Milwaukee, Louisiana. These cities are on fire. The president shows up. This is nothing but symbolic.And I think the best thing he should do is just stop talking, let these things be handled at the local level. The media's going to do enough fanning of flames and creating drama. He doesn't need to add to it.I am going to continue to fight and resist and push back against this anti- cop president's attempt to transform this profession of law enforcement.  We don't need to be transformed. He knows nothing about it. He's never done this job.Some of the things he recommends that police put into their training are just going to get officers hurt and killed as well as citizens.So, right now, you know, with what he's done with this thing to set this whole country on fire with his race politics, he should just leave it alone.BARTIROMO: Bill Johnson, do you agree with that?JOHNSON: I do. I think that a lot of the recommendations coming from the administration, and particularly the disarming of police, taking away defensive gear like bullet-proof vests and helmets and bullet-proof cars, and at the same time, appeasing very violent movements, it's appeasement, it's disarmament. He's become the Neville Chamberlain of this war on cops.BARTIROMO: Wow. Bill Johnson, Sheriff Clarke, thanks very much, gentlemen. We appreciate your time had I morning.CLARKE: All lives matter.BARTIROMO: We will be watching.The FBI director facing a wave of criticism, meanwhile, during a House committee hearing after the agency closes its investigation of Hillary Clinton's e-mail. But she might not be in the clear just yet, as we look ahead this morning. We're focused there next on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The State Department is picking up the ball in the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. It has announced it will reopen an internal review of her handling of classified material when she was secretary of state. This coming, of course, as FBI Director James Comey appeared in front of a congressional committee this past week and defended his decision not to criminally charge Clinton.Joining me right now is James Kallstrom, former assistant director of the FBI.And, Jim, it is always a pleasure to have you on the program.JAMES KALLSTROM, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Nice to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.What's your take? First off, on this breakdown of rule of law that we're seeing. I know this is bothersome to you as well.KALLSTROM: Maria, I'm so worried about our country and our democracy. I mean, lying now is just rampant. No one seems to really care. A poll of Democrat voters said even if she was indicted, they would still vote for her, a majority of people.You know, whatever happened about duty? John Kennedy saying, ""Don't ask what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.""  That's dead and buried, you know. I just feel bad for people that are growing up in this country, because it's so vastly different than it was when I was young.BARTIROMO: I've got to go through the Jim Comey testimony with you for a moment. First of all, I was very taken aback that the interview that was done of Hillary Clinton with the FBI was not recorded and it was not under oath.You were there at the FBI for so long. Is this customary not to record a conversation with a major subject, not to put them under oath?KALLSTROM: I haven't been there for a while, but I was taken aback by that. And I was also taken aback by the fact that he acted like he hadn't even spoken to the agents that were there. I forget his exact words, but it was sort of lackadaisical as to what that even meant.BARTIROMO: Yes, he said he didn't do the interview, other agents did, and he has notes.KALLSTROM: Yes. I mean, why she wouldn't have been asked -- I think it's important for the public to know, what was she asked and what were her answers?BARTIROMO: Right.KALLSTROM: Did she take the Fifth Amendment 35 times? Did she refuse to answer? Did she not have a recollection of the facts?BARTIROMO: Yes.KALLSTROM: You know, that's all important stuff. This woman's running for president of the United States.BARTIROMO: Right.KALLSTROM: This is the same woman that I believe from reports was fired from the Watergate Commission for lying and who went to the Andrews Air Force Base and lied to the parents with the caskets 20 feet away.BARTIROMO: Well, this is a really important point, because Jim Comey was asked, did he see the congressional testimony, where she said to congress, I never sent or received any classified information and I gave the state department all of my e-mails, which we then learned there were 30,000 e- mails that were destroyed. So, she I think lied to Congress. And he said, no, I didn't see that testimony.KALLSTROM: Well, I would have thought all of that would have been incorporated into this investigation, her prior testimony and prior statements. Of course, those are critically important. How can you do an investigation and not look at those things?And what about the Clinton Foundation? I mean, what's going on with that?  He says I can't talk about that. He needs to talk about that before the election. People need to know, is that under investigation? You know, on paper, that looks like a huge, huge criminal conspiracy to me.BARTIROMO: We know that she was talking to the Russians when she was secretary of state and approved a deal for U.S. uranium, a huge amount of uranium to go to the Russians, and then Russia gave money to the Clinton Foundation. I mean, this is all in Peter Schweizer 's ""Clinton Cash"" book.KALLSTROM: And the five people on the board of the company that received it, you know, donated about $2,500,000 each to the foundation. So, it just never, never ends.And as far as intent, when you set up a separate -- I mean, here's a woman who's been around the government a long, long time. When you set up a server that's for the express purpose of not complying with the Freedom of Information Act, the official records act, what more intent do you need?  And you tell people to take off security notifications on top of documents.  What further intent do you need?BARTIROMO: I'm glad you brought up intent, because I want to play for you what Rudy Giuliani said to me this past week. But it's interesting, because when you look at the situation, what was your intention of having a private server? It was to keep your communication private. That's your intent.KALLSTROM: And the president says it's the most sophisticated, the best lady that could ever be recommended for this office. And then she wants to, when someone says --BARTIROMO: Scrub it.KALLSTROM: Scrub it, she says what do you mean, with a cloth? This whole playing dumb like she didn't understand this stuff.BARTIROMO: It was so disingenuous. Here's Mayor Giuliani. He also raised the issue of intent last week on Fox Business.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: The director of the FBI made a really wrong decision, completely incorrect, and gave people a completely wrong impression of how you prove intent and then ignored the true statutes that don't require intent and gave no explanation of why there would be no indictment under those statutes. In fact, he laid out all the facts that would require an indictment. He said she was extremely careless. Well, the statute requires gross negligence, gross negligence and extremely careless are the same thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Bottom line, do you think there is room here for a possible perjury probe that should be started for Hillary Clinton, and what about the foundation? Do you think we will find out anything and get any details of this investigation before the election?KALLSTROM: I think without question that should be looked at, you know.  And that should be done expeditiously. We need to know that.You know, were her comments -- you know, what difference does that make, if all that comment was in line with, you know, what the actual truth is?And absolutely, the Clinton Foundation needs to be looked at. What kind of a foundation is this? It gives, what, 20 percent of its monies to charity?  How does it even meet the requirements of a 501c3? And is the IRS looking at that? I doubt it.BARTIROMO: Did politics get in the way of the FBI's work, do you think, as a longtime FBI man?KALLSTROM: I just don't understand why Jim Comey felt he had to make that decision and take Justice Department off the hook. He should have presented the facts, sent the facts over to the attorney general and let her make the decision and then live politically with that decision.BARTIROMO: Jim Kallstrom, thanks very much for joining us. We appreciate it.KALLSTROM: Thank you.BARTIROMO: James Kallstrom joining us here on set.Attorney General Loretta Lynch getting ready to testify on Capitol Hill this Tuesday about the Clinton e-mail investigation. A member of the House committee that will question her will join me next.Darrell Issa on deck as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Attorney General Loretta Lynch set to testify before Congress this Tuesday.  The nation's top law enforcement officer taking her turn in the hot seat to answer questions about the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation just days after a House committee grilled FBI Director James Comey.Let's talk about it now with California Congressman Darrell Issa, who is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee.Congressman, thanks very much for joining us this morning.REP. DARRELL ISSA, R-CALIF.: Thanks, Maria. And thanks for covering sort of this evolving story of Hillary Clinton and her various unlawful acts.BARTIROMO: What are you expecting to hear from Loretta Lynch on Tuesday?  What are you expecting to question her about?ISSA: Well, I think she's going to fall back on her earlier statement that she's simply going to take the career professionals' recommendations, even though, as you said in the earlier segment, the FBI director ignored the fact that she lied before Congress. A congressional referral is not required if you observe a crime, and it's a crime to lie to Congress.So, absolutely, it's an open-and-shut case. He's already made a determination that she said things or that she, in fact, transmitted marked, highly classified materials repeatedly. I don't think he really thinks she's so unsophisticated as to not know better.So, he has a case right there but ignored even mentioning it or in any positive way sending it. And I think Loretta lynch will do the same. To be honest, and I don't want to predict what's going to happen before our committee overly, but my assumption is that this whitewash will continue, and it will include the attorney general, who obviously met with the president's -- or met with the former president in an inappropriate way and had a private conversation that we'll never know part of.But this is the nature of this administration, and Hillary Clinton in a way is simply part of a very hidden administration that gets away with doing what it wants to do.BARTIROMO: So, you think politics got in the way for James Comey, when he testified?(CROSSTALK)ISSA: I think he blinked. Maria, I think he blinked. I think he could have done exactly what was said earlier. He could have presented the facts as he presented them in that initial interview, and skipped anything beyond that. You know, the FBI is not how you get to a criminal prosecution. The Department of Justice regularly with other agencies and on their own evaluate facts and present to grand juries.The fact is, if he said these are the facts as I found them and then sent it over to the Department of Justice, let those U.S. attorneys say we cannot prosecute it because no jury will convict or no jury will convict her because at least one Democrat will always vote no. That may be the case, what we call jury nullification.But the reality is, she knowingly with aforethought, planning, circumvented the law, and it led to by her own statement at least 300 people sending and receiving classified documents. And yet, the FBI director and I suspect Loretta Lynch, are going to have us believe that none of those 300 people should be held accountable for what is a violation of the law, one that regularly leads to people's firing and criminal prosecution.BARTIROMO: And, of course, this just a couple of days after President Clinton went on Loretta Lynch's plane, the sitting attorney general. They spoke for 30 minutes. We understand they were alone. Have you ever seen someone in such a high position, the attorney general, have such a meeting without staff in the room taking notes?ISSA: No. I've had a lot of meetings with a lot of people for a lot of years in government at these levels. There are always notetakers. I repeat, always notetakers. In WikiLeaks, some of the things that were said when I traveled overseas and met with foreign leaders became public. The reason is there is always a notetaker.BARTIROMO: Sure.ISSA: You just don't have these. And by the way, you shouldn't have them.  This kind of conversation with a civilian -- he's the ex-president, but he's a civilian -- is the kind of thing that shouldn't happen.BARTIROMO: Congressman, someone said to me a week ago, well, look, James Comey did not want to play god. We have a major presidential election. He didn't want to be in a spot where he's going to be deciding. He doesn't want to play god. I guess he just did.ISSA: Well, he did and he didn't. And I'm going to back off a little bit on the FBI director. He presented to the American public her guilt and then made this assumption that she couldn't be prosecuted.But the American people on November 8th are going to evaluate what they now know. They know that she did set up the server, she did transmit and receive vast amounts of classified materials, and they should have been classified at the time. In some cases, the classifications were removed.  At least 100 times to approximately 300 people, she was involved in sending and receiving documents that did say classified on them at various levels.BARTIROMO: Right.ISSA: And then she lied about it. That's for the American voter to decide. I actually have faith that the American voter in a sober moment when they decide somebody that will do this, apparently for her convenience and privacy, can they be trusted when, in fact, they're going to be controlling our men and women in uniform? They're in harm's way. These kinds of things absolutely get people killed.BARTIROMO: Right.Well, we've got the convention next week. We'll see if the Republicans get behind Donald Trump. Are you behind Donald Trump?ISSA: You know, I'm behind the nominee of the party.BARTIROMO: OK.ISSA: And I'm behind -- and, Maria, here's what I hope people will focus on. The nominee of the party, if elected, will have about 24 key cabinet officers, including a vice president, who will be leading government. If you look at the likely people that would lead government in a Trump administration, I think what you see is a lot of people who want to make America safe again.BARTIROMO: Right.ISSA: Who believe America is great and wanted to recognize that once again.BARTIROMO: Congressman, thanks so much for joining us this morning.ISSA: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Congressman Darrell Issa there.President Obama's trip overseas interrupted by tragedy here at home as he prepares to visit Dallas. Our panel is next as we look ahead to the convention next week.""Sunday Morning Futures"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.President Obama cutting his European trip short as he plans to visit Dallas this upcoming week, with the country reeling from the deadly ambush on police officers.We want to look at his upcoming visit with our panel, Ed Rollins, is former principal White House adviser to President Reagan, chief strategist for a pro-Trump super PAC, and he is a Fox News political analyst. Richard Fowler is with us this morning, Democratic strategist and radio talk show host, and Gerry Baker with us, ""The Wall Street Journal's"" managing editor.Gentlemen, good to see you.ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Good morning.BARTIROMO: What are your expectations for President Obama going to Dallas?  Ed?ROLLINS: I think it's a very important trip for him. I think it's a very important trip for the country. I think he basically has to have a very high level tone.This was murder in the streets. The police are so very important to us to keep law and order. And I think to a certain extent, the president needs to stand behind the police.BARTIROMO: Gerry?GERRY BAKER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL MANAGING EDITOR: Well, Maria, you heard from previous guests, the anger, actually, an the bitterness and the real concern that there is among many police chiefs, among many police officers around the country and they really do think that the president has not done enough to really calm the environment that's created the tragedy that happened and the massacre actually that happened in Dallas on Thursday night.And they really want to see -- they want to hear stronger words of condemnation and not this sort of on the one hand, on the other hand approach that the president has taken to so many of these issues.BARTIROMO: Which was articulated in an op-ed in the journal yesterday.  This is about leadership.BAKER: It is about leadership. Look, of course, the president is right.  There are terrible injustices in this country and terrible things happening in this country. But at times like when you have an incident like Dallas --BARTIROMO: Right.BAKER: -- it's not right -- I think leadership requires a clarity and I think what -- I'm afraid what we've not seen from the president on so many issues actually, whether it's terrorism, whether it's this issue of race relationship I don't think -- I don't think enough Americans are hearing clarity from the president, moral clarity on where the country is and what it needs.BARTIROMO: Can he do it, Richard?RICHARD FOWLER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I mean, he's going to have to do it. There's no way around it, Maria. But I think the president has a really, really tough needle to thread here because one, he does have to speak to the people who support the police and police departments across the country. But at the same time, he has to speak to the African-American community and other Americans who believe that we are at a tipping point in this country, right? You saw it with tweets like from former Congressman Joe Walsh who said outlandish things.But we're at a tipping point. So, this president has to string this needle very effectively to make sure he's speaking to both groups and that's hard to do.BARTIROMO: We heard from both campaigns, Hillary Clinton as well as Donald Trump. We're going into the week before the convention, the Republican convention.Let's talk about these conventions. What are you expecting, Ed Rollins?ROLLINS: A big urban city, Cleveland, obviously with an overwhelming majority of African-Americans, it's going to be very, very important that the peace, the outside community is going to be as judged what goes on, at the convention. I've been doing this for 50 years, this is the least prepared convention and I know less about it than anybody.We don't know the keynote speaker is, we don't know the vice presidential candidate, we don't know what Trump's going to say. He has to basically take this as a real opportunity to gain some momentum. And if he doesn't, the Democrats come back the following week and they will basically have a jump on him and be hard to catch.BARTIROMO: Trump is going to release the list of speakers this week.  We're probably also going to hear who the vice presidential pick is, isn't that right, Gerry?BAKER: We should. I mean, typically, the presidential nominee announces towards the end of this week, just ahead of the conventions, to try to get as much publicity for the vice presidential nominee as he or she can. So, we would expect that this week. Of course, as Ed says, nothing about this convention or this presidential nominee, Donald Trump is conventional, as it were. So, who knows what we'll see?BARTIROMO: Who do you think is the V.P.?ROLLINS: I'm beginning to think it's Gingrich at this point in time.BARTIROMO: Newt Gingrich?ROLLINS: I think it would be very helpful, because Trump needs someone who really understands the substance of government and what a president does every day and what a Congress does every day. He certainly could have that. He's a peer. I think to a certain extent he'd be positive.BARTIROMO: Who do you think Hillary's V.P. is, Richard?FOWLER: That's a tough one. I think it's a race between a Tim Kaine and maybe a Tim Kaine and a Ryan out of Ohio. I think people are underestimating Congressman Tim Ryan. But I think he does everything that Hillary Clinton needs him to do. He appeals to working class, blue collar folks and also sort of -- he's not too much power at the bottom of the ticket.She can't have anybody too much power at the bottom of the ticket, because, you know, she admits herself, she's not -- you know, she's not -- she's not her husband.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROLLINS: She's not the president, in the campaigning sense.BARTIROMO: Your thoughts, Gerry, on these conventions? What should we be looking for?BAKER: Well, so again, on the vice presidential pick, the rule is that generally speaking we, the media gets very excited about the vice presidential pick. What they can do is they can do harm.BARTIROMO: People don't vote for the V.P.BAKER: They don't. What they can do -- they rarely give an advantage.  Maybe Johnson helped win Texas for Kennedy in 1960. But they rarely bring the kind of advantage that people think.But what they can do, the wrong pick can do harm. So, they've got to be careful. I think Trump needs someone reassuring. I think Newt Gingrich reassures conservatives. I don't think he reassures many of those voters not the middle ground who may have doubts.So, I think a general -- a former general, a military figure might do that for Trump.For Hillary, I agree with Richard. It's either Tim Kaine or I think actually Sherrod Brown is still a possibility.BARTIROMO: Oh, wow.All right. Great panel. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Have a great Sunday.That will do it for ""Sunday Morning Futures.""  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Well, Fox on top of a dis to obvious to miss, Hillary Clinton's not-so-subtle zinger that the president's failure to help build a credible force in Syria helped trigger a vacuum the bad guys are more than happy to fill. Is she trying to find a little distance between herself and the big guy?To former presidential candidate, former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr., who is watching all this quite closely, ahead of the president, who will be addressing the nation in about 20 minutes on the latest of these Iraqi developments.Governor, good to have you.What do you make of what Hillary Clinton was saying in this interview?JON HUNTSMAN JR., R-FORMER UTAH GOVERNOR: Well, I think she is trying to make fairly simple point.And that was if the president had taken her advice on more lethal assistance to the nationalists in Syria back in 2012, then today, we'd probably be looking at a much different situation, both in Syria and Iraq.And truth be told, she is probably correct. And since these issues are playing out in a very critically important part of the world, she obviously wanted to go on the record, probably a lot politics. And do you gain some from differentiating yourself from the president, as Republicans tried to do at the end of the George W. Bush administration?CAVUTO: Right. Right.HUNTSMAN: That probably not too unusual at this point in a political cycle.CAVUTO: But does she take her base on the left for advantage -- or to advantage here? In other words, assuming she has got that locked down, because those same folks, the Elizabeth Warren loyalists and all, might say, well, that is not how we feel.HUNTSMAN: Well, she is going to have to draw upon her experiences the secretary of state. She has got a record. She has been around the world. She has been involved in these policy discussions.She is going to have to work very hard over the next year or so, if she is in fact going to run for the presidency -- I assume she will -- in coming out with her own approaches to the issues that are separate and aside and distinct from President Obama's.And they will be international economic policy, and they will be security policy, how to deal with Russia, in light of our failures there, how to deal with China in light of zero strategy there, a Middle East that clearly is in flux and in need of definition.So, she has got the whole world to look at. She's going to have to say, where am I basically identified with bad policies, which basically is worldwide, and how can I begin to define some new territory that's uniquely mine?CAVUTO: I have talked to a number of generals and the like, Governor, who said that whatever the president says today -- this is ahead of the planned remarks -- that the president has already made it clear that this -- these airstrikes throughout Northern Iraq are going to continue for a while.But to a man and one woman, they kind of were telling me, it is too late and that this might jar the rebels, but it won't dislodge them. What do you think?HUNTSMAN: Well, so airstrikes in and of themselves really don't constitute a strategy.You have got to isolate ISIS politically. And you do that by bringing in a more unifying, inclusive government in Baghdad. Maliki has been an absolute disaster in scaring people away from him, and governing like a partisan Shiite. And then you have got to isolate ISIS from a military standpoint.And that would be by giving more in the way of support, both from an intelligence standpoint and equipment, along with the airstrikes, to those in the north, including the Kurds. It seems to me that if you don't have a strategy that speaks to political isolation of ISIS and military isolation of ISIS, you're not going to go anywhere.CAVUTO: You know, knowing that you would be coming today, Governor, I would be remiss if I didn't play back this clip from the president in a New York Times interview and how he looked at various extremists, including, tellingly, from your own party. This is the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: House Republicans, as we speak, are trying to pass the most extreme and unworkable versions of a bill that they already know is going nowhere.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO: Well, that wasn't the one I was looking for.It was from that interview with Friedman in The New York Times in which he said Republican extremists, those with extreme views, are making it next to impossible to get anything done -- paraphrasing here, sir -- that they -- they are -- are as much a threat to our system as anything.What did you make of that?HUNTSMAN: Well, listen, he has the bully pulpit, which is the most powerful weapon in politics.I think he has used it very ineffectively, particularly in his interaction with Capitol Hill. The president fundamentally is not a deal-maker. He doesn't know how to sit down with people either in this party or in the opposition party and cut any deal.And I'll tell you, one of the biggest problems, Neil, we're having on the world stage is that he doesn't know how to cut deals with international leaders. So our problems in many of the hot spots of the world really do stem from the fact that he doesn't know how to cut a deal.I mean, foreign policy is really about choices, and choices carry consequences. And in making choices, you have got to sit down you have got to negotiate with people who sometimes...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: No, no, but I think what he is saying, Governor -- and I'm sorry I wasn't more clear in my question -- is that it's the obstructionists on the far right who are making progress next to impossible. He didn't say anything about obstructionists on the far left. In fact, if anything, he said nothing approaches that on the far leftDo you agree with that?HUNTSMAN: Well, he is a partisan Democrat. And of course he is going to say that. And we have some duly elected representatives on Capitol Hill.We're about to have another round of elections. And I think the people are about to speak up on how they feel about the president and where he is taking this country.CAVUTO: Sir, I would also be remiss if I didn't mention that there is a movement within your party to look to Mitt Romney again, because a lot of the things he warned about, including the growing instability in Iraq and the reemergence of Vladimir Putin, were things he was quite prescient about.And there's this argument that maybe he should go for the hat trick, a third try. What do you think?HUNTSMAN: Well, I think he is -- he is -- Governor Romney is a good man. I think he has already been abundantly clear about his desire to seek the presidency for the third time.I don't think that's in the cards. But I will tell you this. I think we're on the cusp of having a very important debate within the Republican Party on America's role in the world. To be sure, we have not had any kind of meaningful or comprehensive debate on national security or our national interest probably in over 10 years, when we went into the Middle East, following 9/11.We have taken some body blows in those years, 9/11 included, and certainly the economic calamity that has ensued. The only discussion in politics has been about jobs and economic revitalization. And we left the whole world open in terms of really defining what America's strategy should be.So I think we find ourselves -- and, you know, you're going to get a whole lot of people who are going to run for president in 2016. And out of it...CAVUTO: Are you, by the way? Are you?HUNTSMAN: I'm not here as a candidate. I told you that before, Neil.
