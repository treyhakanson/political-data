1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/10/20/bill-oreilly-ebola-and-race/	Bill O'Reilly: Ebola and race	"One of the big dividers in American society is race. Not bigotry so much. Almost all sane Americans, accept and understand bigotry is wrong. As the Declaration says, all men are created equal and should be treated equally by their fellow citizens in government. The problem with race is how it is used in policy. Racial politics has created the grievance industry where some minority people and their white enablers believe they should be compensated for historical abuses.Some Americans also believe they should get money, direct payments for subsidies reparations it is called. There are others who say because of slavery and the forced removal of Native Americans from their land that they cannot compete in today's marketplace, therefore, they want stuff that is the white privilege movement. That's especially troubling because it is being pushed primarily by white liberals who feel guilty that some minorities are not succeeding in America.Therefore they believe those minorities are victims who cannot compete and must be treated as children. And granted blanket dispensations for irresponsible behavior. All of the above is corrosive to minorities and to American society in general.Enter the Ebola controversy. It's now been established that three black nations in Africa -- Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia -- are Ground Zero for the spread of the deadly disease. 14 other African nations have now banned West Africans in the Ebola zone from entering their countries and 14 other nations have other travel restrictions.But when ""Talking Points"" and others suggest the U.S.A. do the same thing, we're attacked as racist by pathetic ideological loons who could not care less about protecting the folks. This is a public health issue, a safety issue. Not a racial issue. Ebola knows no color. But the fact is that a Liberian national Thomas Duncan started the Ebola mess in America by lying to immigration authorities. Mr. Duncan paid for that with his life and his case has embarrassed American health officials.So today, President Obama appointed a political guy, Ron Klain, to be his quote Ebola czar.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: It may make sense for us to have one person in part just so that after this initial surge of activity we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we are crossing all the t's and dotting all the i's going forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: The appointment of Mr. Klain a former chief of staff to Vice President Biden will take the pressure off the besieged Dr. Thomas Frieden head of the CDC who has mucked things up big time.But the question remains will President Obama protect the American people by stopping travelers from the epidemic Ebola area?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I don't have a philosophical objection necessarily to a travel ban if that is the thing that is going to keep the American people safe. The problem is that in all the discussions I have had thus far with experts in the field, experts in infectious disease is that a travel ban is less effective than the measures that we are currently instituting.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: It doesn't matter, Mr. President. You do everything you can to protect Americans. This is not a comparative situation. You do it all. ""Talking Points"" predicts if there is one more, one more Ebola case in the U.S.A., a travel ban will have to be imposed.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" June 1, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATIE COURIC, YAHOO! NEWS: Do you think ultimately one of your goals may be to push Hillary Clinton a little more to the left?SEN. BERNIE SANDERS I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No.COURIC: No.SANDERS: No. My goal is to win this election.COURIC: Would you be interested in being her vice president?SANDERS: Would she be interested in being my vice president? We'll talk about it. But the point is, the way you win elections, Katie, is by raising issues that the American people think make sense. And I think we are doing that. We will be outspent, but I think we have got a good shot to win this thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: I don't know what the whispering was about. Eventually Bernie Sanders, Democratic presidential candidate now, independent senator who describes himself as a socialist, getting a lot of crowds on the trail. We're back with the panel. George, how about the new attention on Bernie Sanders in this race.GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, politics is supposed to be fun. That's why Democratic activists are in it, because it's fun, and he's fun in the sense that he's kind of naughty. He says he's an independent and he says he's a socialist. In fact he's neither. In no meaningful sense is he an independent when he caucuses with the Democrats and he votes with the Democrats. He gets his committee assignments from the Democrats and they count against the Democrats quotas. And, by the way, he's seeking the nomination of the Democratic Party, so he's a Democrat.And being a socialist, I don't know what he means by that. Once upon a time socialism meant the government ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange. Then they watered it down and it meant public ownership of the commanding heights of the economy, heavy industry, and all that.And now it's European social democracy. And I a few months ago asked him what he meant by socialism, he said social democracy in Europe. So I guess we should think Greece is what he has in mind for the United States.A social democracy means heavy regulation of commerce. We've got that in this country. It means a social safety net -- 66 percent of our federal budget is entitlement programs. And it means redistribution of wealth. Our federal government does very little else but redistribute money. I don't know what he's talking about.BAIER: Juan, he does get big crowds. He is dealing, however, with a controversy in that he -- this essay he wrote in 1972 for an alternative newspaper about passages about a rape fantasy that he has been asked about. What about Bernie Sanders, the candidate and where he stands?JUAN WILLIAMS, THE HILL: Well, I think what you are seeing is that the base of the Democratic Party is excited by Bernie Sanders. Why? Because he comes out and he says things, and this is going to upset you, George, but he thinks that we should have 90 percent tax rate in some cases on the very rich in this country. You like that?WILL: I didn't like it, and neither did Ted Kennedy.WILLIAMS: OK, but you say you don't know what difference is. Bernie Sanders is a real difference here, 90 percent. That's in the 50s, Eisenhower type thing.Anyway, the second thing to say is, unlike Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor who came out on Saturday night, I thought came out kind of flat, Bernie Sanders goes out there and says directly, break up the banks. Stop this. The rich are getting richer. He speaks with a passion that is not heard right now from the Democratic base.BAIER: He also has pointed to Hillary Clinton saying ""You didn't make a decision on trade, on TPP. I have. I'm against it. So is Elizabeth Warren."" How far do candidates go, Charles, against Hillary Clinton is really the question.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, he is not running for the presidency. He knows he's not going to win the presidency even though he whispers that he is running for presidency. Kim Kardashian has a better shot at winning the presidency than Bernie Sanders. We have never had a socialist run seriously, we aren't ever going to have one. Norman Thomas, the socialist party leader, ran six times. The best he ever did was two percent of the vote. Bernie is not going to get two percent.BAIER: So why is Hillary Clinton making a jog to the left?KRAUTHAMMER: That's question -- I mean, it seems to me that it tells you that she is so uncertain about her own position that even with no position she is running left. I think it tells you either that she believes this stuff, which I think is implausible, or that she wants to secure the nomination easily and without any --WILLIAMS: Very quickly, I think the party wants her to run, I mean, that's what you are seeing.BAIER: Well, they'll be more to talk about.
