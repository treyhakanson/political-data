This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""I know, right. The endorsements keep rolling in as the four republican presidential contenders try to build support ahead of crucial primaries next week. This morning, Donald Trump won a support of former GOP rival, Dr. Ben Carson.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEN CARSON, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Now some people said, but why would you get behind a man like Donald Trump? I've come to know Donald Trump over the last few years. He is actually a very intelligent man who cares deeply about America. There are two different Donald Trump's. There's the one you see on the stage and there is the one who is very cerebral. He sits there and considers things very carefully. You can have a very good conversation with him. And that's the Donald Trump that you'll going to start seeing more and more of.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Donald explains a special role he has in mind for his friend Ben, if elected president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He was telling me things about education and it was so right on, and it was so good. And it is such an important element for our country. And I said Ben, congratulations. You just have to get involved with us with education. And he's going to get very much involved in health care, where he is an expert. It such an honor to have Ben, he is a friend. He's become a friend and I really appreciate the endorsement. Ben, thank you.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Meanwhile, Ted Cruz also scored an endorsement today from the National Review, quote. ""Cruz is a talented and committed conservative. He is also republicans' best chance for keeping their presidential nomination from going to someone with low character and worse principles. We support Ted Cruz for president."" All right, let's talk about surprises, shall we? Sorpresas. Any surprise Dana, you think that Ben Carson endorsed Donald Trump and then also with (inaudible) to Ted Cruz in National Review.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: A little bit. There's always like that moment when finally, it used to be the newspapers endorsement carried a lot of weight and say you would want to see -- growing up in Denver, who did the Rocky Mountain News choose and who did the Denver Post choose. They were usually the opposite sides. But that was always an important thing. This time it is more important, I think like earlier in the week, Ted Cruz got the endorsement of Carly Fiorina, the former presidential candidate. Two weeks ago, it is Chris Christie decided to go with Trump, and now Ben Carson. So in a way, it is a little bit of a surprise, but I thought that Ben Carson gave a really nice speech there. And again, remember I'm for adding, it's not subtracting.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: . when it comes to endorsements. I also think that regardless of who wins the nomination on the republican side or even if the democrats were to win the presidency, I think Dr. Ben Carson's contribution to either education or health care or the moral character and moral fiber of the country is going to be very important. And he -- actually, when he did his concession speech, well, it was saying that he was withdrawing when he was at CPAC last week. He talked about how his organization is going to continue to be a voice for those issues. And I think that he is a great model for a lot of people who have wonderful careers, achieve a lot and then decide to dedicate the remaining time in life to public service.GUILFOYLE: Yeah --PERINO: So I'm for that.GUILFOYLE: Oh yes, very well stated. I like him a lot. We've all liked him. I think, you know, at this table, certainly he's a class act. I think he added a tremendous amount to this campaign, to the process. And his remarks, you know, yesterday and today are really kind of point to that. So I hope he does stay involved. This is a great contribution.PERINO: If I could just say one other thing on the National Review endorsement of Ted Cruz.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: I actually wasn't that surprise because in reading the --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . for the last year, they had so many, I thought, very favorable features of Ted Cruz. They have lots of sources on the Cruz campaign. So I'm not surprised by the endorsement.GUILFOYLE: It was pretty much an endorsement at that point --PERINO: I don't know. I would think, I think they would quibble with that.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: But it wasn't an entirely a surprise to me.GUILFOYLE: You could read the tea leaves. Last week, I said that I thought that Ben was going to endorse Donald Trump, and indeed he has. Eric, what do you make of the endorsement and how helpful is it?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: I think it's very helpful, for a couple of reasons. Number one, the evangelicals, you know Ted Cruz wants to own that vote. Donald Trump has done very well with the evangelicals. And I think this will only help solidify that going forward. That was important. But also, so Donald Trump said he had a long discussion with Ben Carson, yesterday. Then there was a debate, and there was a different Donald Trump on the debate stage last night. It was a little bit more, wasn't as fire brandish, he was a little bit more thoughtful, a little bit quieter. A lot of people would say it was his best performance in a long time. And maybe Dr. Carson is giving him a little bit of that, the lesson on tone which would be a great thing for him as well. And I noticed when Donald Trump has 9:00 a.m. press conference, announcing that Carson is going to be his endorsement, an endorsement from Carson is going -- was going to happen. He also mentioned education. Now Dana mentioned it as well. Which tells me, there is something there, the Ben Carson could add to if it ends up being a Donald Trump administration. Well, maybe there's something there, that he would bring in a Ben Carson and say, hey, run the Department of Education, help us out with this. Or who know --GUILFOYLE: Or surgeon general.BOLLING: But remember people say he is not -- Donald Trump is not qualified to run the country. But he keep bring people who are qualified. I mean, there's no question, Ben Carson is qualified to do a lot of these things, surgeon general, Department of Education. That's how you do it. That's how you get it done if you don't have the political --GUILFOYLE: Well kind of, yeah, a business approach of like, best practices, getting the people that are experts and very qualified in their fields.BOLLING: Interested on the NRO?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: No surprise either? They want anyone but Trump, and they see the only path to anyone but Trump is through Ted Cruz.GUILFOYLE: And you've said that's the only other path is true, Ted Cruz in terms of the math and number, down to two people. All right Greg, what do you make of these two endorsements?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well, I've always been a big fan of Carson. But I keep wondering, what kind of delicious candy did Donald Trump offer Ben to get him into the Trump van? You know, that's kind of a pedophile comparison.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, we got it.GUTFELD: Who would do such a thing? Oh, yes, Trump did that with Ben Carson. So that's what I find really interesting is that we're in an era now.PERINO: Yup.GUTFELD: . where you can compare somebody to a child molester or say that they are pathologically damaged. And then still get that person's endorsement. And it tells me that even an outsider will sell out. An outsider -- also wants to be an insider. He wants to be part of the bandwagon. But I will say this also --GUILFOYLE: But do you really think that Ben Carson would -- honestly, because you've said nice things about Ben Carson.GUTFELD: I love Ben Carson.GUILFOYLE: . that he would sell himself out if he didn't actually like him or believe him?GUTFELD: I think that -- it is kind to be pretty hard just to endorse somebody who likens you to a child molester. But the other thing too is they keep talking about how they -- Trump and Carson did bury the hatchet. I would be careful using that terminology with Ben Carson. He might take it literally.GUILFOYLE: Or bury the hammer.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Yes. Is it indeed? All right, what about your buddy Ben?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I know. I just -- I'm with Greg. I don't understand that -- I mean he called him a pathological liar. He said that in fact.GUTFELD: If I was a fake?WILLIAMS: . the people of Iowa were stupid to be buying in to Ben Carson. So I can believe you can try to bury the hatchet. But let's look at the politics for a second. The politics are Carson refused to have anything to do with Cruz, because he thinks Cruz absolutely cheated in Iowa and then followed up.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: And say, oh let's have a meeting, let's get together, let's settle everything. But used to it to show up to the media that he was talking to Ben. So Ben Carson was mad at Ted Cruz. OK, then you come to, how does he endorse? How does the endorsement mean? I don't think it means much with the evangelicals. I think the evangelicals are already doing pretty well for Donald Trump.BOLLING: You don't think Ben Carson brings any of the evangelicals vote for Donald Trump?WILLIAMS: No, and not at this point. Not at this point.GUILFOYLE: Well, he is saying Trump is --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Trump is doing well with the evangelicals.WILLIAMS: He is already doing well.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: So they here for me is more like, you know what? No, no, no, hold on, that the key here for me is more like reality TV. It's like you're fired or you're off the island. Both Christie and Ben Carson seem smaller and removed from the -- as opposed to Carson who previously said, you know, I'm going to do something to bring evangelicals, the religious community, into the political process going forward, run his own game. Now it's simply that he is in Trump's way and I think, I think Greg is not to it. He wanted to get on the bandwagon while the bandwagon was still rolling.GUTFELD: And Christie. Christie -- like you said it before. Christie needed a job. And I think Ben, he looks at this as, as Dr. Carson does --WILLIAMS: Sure.GUTFELD: It looks that -- as an opportunity. As a lot of people do. When they see something that's happening that's a phenomenon. You go like, should I get on this or should I stay on this?BOLLING: But they're getting on the ones that they feel are going to be end up --WILLIAMS: But Greg --BOLLING: The best chance --WILLIAMS: But Eric --GUTFELD: That's my point.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But Eric, let me ask you. Let me ask you of matter of integrity and principle, conservative principle, how do you get on the bandwagon if you are a republican conservative with somebody who alienates from the GOP's traditional stance on international trade. How about Israel? I'm neutral on Israel. How about social security benefits? No cut he says. How about Cuba? Oh, no problem. Let's make a deal. Obama should just make a better deal. He says -- and he says.BOLLING: Everyone says -- Marco Rubio said the same thing.WILLIAMS: Oh, the GOP should just embrace me. Forget about the real political ideological differences. Embrace me.BOLLING: Is this a question or a comment?WILLIAMS: It's the truth.BOLLING: All right.WILLIAMS: That's what it is. It's the truth.GUILFOYLE: I mean, what about secretary of health, and what are these, human --PERINO: I find it -- I just don't think anybody runs for president because they want a cabinet secretary position.WILLIAMS: No.PERINO: Could he do that?GUILFOYLE: I'm saying -- will he make a good -- that might be a good job for me as well.BOLLING: I don't suggest that either.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I didn't say -- I wouldn't --BOLLING: OK, all right.PERINO: She just asked me a question.BOLLING: All right, all right. I just --PERINO: I didn't say anything about you.BOLLING: OK.PERINO: No. I didn't.GUILFOYLE: Here's the bottom line.BOLLING: All right.GUILFOYLE: I think everyone agrees that.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: We got to go on the next segment.GUILFOYLE: . Dr. Carson will make a very good addition to anybody's team. I think he suffer for this country.PERINO: Which, he might have comment at the very beginning of the segment.WILLIAMS: I don't know how he'll make a good.PERINO: That's what he said.WILLIAMS: . secretary of education. He doesn't know anything about education.GUTFELD: He'll be great on Grey's Anatomy.BOLLING: Apparently he knows a lot.GUILFOYLE: Oh, he could be the narrow.WILLIAMS: He doesn't know anything about education.GUILFOYLE: . Dr. McDreamy --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I told you, I find Ben Carson, he's quite attractive.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: It's been a busy few days in politics, just saying. Up next, we'll show you our highlights from this week on the campaign trail. And later, it's Facebook Friday. Post your questions for us now at facebook.com/thefivefnc, back in a moment, (inaudible).(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Last night in Miami, the four GOP contenders squared off in the final debate before next week's big Super Tuesday primaries. And now we're going around the table and share some of our favorite moments from last night's face-off and other campaign trail events that went on this week, and Greg is going to kick it off.GUTFELD: Yeah, you know, a lot of people say I've been hard on Donald Trump, so I decided to take a Trump moment that I like. This was at a Ben Carson presser, and this morning, actually. Let's roll that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much; great honor. And got outside, we have coffee and drinks. Enjoy yourselves. Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: That's my -- it was so nice of him to offer the coffee and drinks. Nobody got jerk to the ground. It's a nice kind of moment. And I thought, oh, what a sweetheart.BOLLING: Water stakes and.GUTFELD: There's no water in there.BOLLING: . line to the lobby?GUTFELD: Coffee and beverages, so it like.BOLLING: Anyone? -- OK.GUILFOYLE: I like that.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: OK. So you know when you are watching television, maybe the show, and you are yelling at the TV saying, why isn't anybody making this point, because it would help them. That's how I've been on common core, because people are failing to connect the dots. And so I was tweeting, don't just say it is about Washington, D.C. because it's not. Tie it to President Obama and the funds. And then it was like Ted Cruz was channeling me. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TED CRUZ, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Common Core is a disaster. And if I am elected president in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day. And let me tell you why you can do that because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. The Obama administration has abused the executive power, enforcing Common Core on the states. It has used race to the top fans to effectively blackmail and force the states to adapt Common Core. But in one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power and I intend to do that.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I was just so relieved that somebody finally made that point. That's the way that you should answer that when it comes to Common Core and Washington D.C., it was the race to the top funds that changed everything.BOLLING: Juan, do you agree?WILLIAMS: No. I think --(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: I think -- you know, I mean, I'm a big fan of trying to improve the quality of education across the country. And so I think that some states don't make an investment in young people and especially in foreign minority communities. So Id o think you have to watch. You can't just be absolutely charge. So there's a role. But the thing is, I also believe in local education. I'm a strong believer in choice. I'm a strong believer in parental and student power, so you don't have teachers unions running things for teachers and not for children. I do worry, though, again, about how some communities get ignored by the power structure in localities.BOLLING: Anyone else? Common Core?GUTFELD: It is a nuances argument. You can be for choice and Common Core.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUTFELD: It's a very though thing.WILLIAMS: But I --GUTFELD: And you have to --PERINO: But if you're a republican, and you're trying to explain why -- what would you do about Common Core is that in Washington, D.C., the only thing is the funding that President Obama tied to race for the top.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: For republican.BOLLING: Tied to it.PERINO: Exactly.BOLLING: Right. That's the important part.PERINO: That's when Cruz says, use to it effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt Common Core. I think as a republican, you're on that debate stage, that's your most effective argument.BOLLING: Because you can't turn it down. You can't say no, we don't want that curriculum, but we still want the funds.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: No, you can't. So but you -- it's not that you're being denied the normal funds that you have. This is additional --BOLLING: Right, right.WILLIAMS: . that would come to you because you are trying on raise your standards. And I think people in the military, by the way, are huge supporters of knowing that if a military family is moving from one place to another, that you don't get suddenly sunk by people who have terrible standards and you got to -- your kids are going to lose out. You need to have something. America is not only nation, we're part of a global economy where --BOLLING: You can still have, you can still have standards and not have Common Core curriculum.WILLIAMS: No, but you have to have some common sense, some understanding that --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: A baseline.BOLLING: Right, yeah.GUILFOYLE: I know.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: This is getting really too much.BOLLING: All right, it seems like taking there.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: I'm gonna throw mine out there.GUILFOYLE: Let's see something else.BOLLING: Very quickly. Let's roll a sound bite that I just -- I couldn't believe I was hearing this. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARCO RUBIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Clearly, John Kasich is -- has a better chance of winning Ohio than I do. And if a voter in Ohio concludes that voting for John Kasich gives us the best chance to stop Donald Trump there, I anticipate that's what they'll do.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So a couple of things on that. I think this is really the reason what I've been kind of railing against with that. What I call an establishment or insiders, is that for a long time, they haven't fought to win. They haven't -- they have run to win. Marco Rubio is literally telling voters to vote for another candidate that he is competing against in Ohio, just to stop Donald Trump. Couple of thoughts, what of his donors has to say about that? I think that's terrible what he's doing to them. And number two, I'm a father. If I told my son, if you can't win, don't worry about it. Make sure someone else doesn't win that you're competing with. That is not the message you send, and I think that's the wrong message Marco Rubio is sending to the American public and to people who may have wanted to vote for him. So that can be great.GUTFELD: It could also be seen as jumping on a grenade. Like if you really feel that Trump is going to be bad for the country, he might feel that way. This is -- it's not about winning or losing. It is about just sacrifice.GUILFOYLE: Well, then what about Ben Carson, he drop out of Florida and let Ted Cruz go because Ted Cruz is the only other one with a mathematical chance to be able to unseat him. Hew want a grenade then do that.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Except the most recent poll show it's only a single digit gap between Trump and Rubio in Florida, so --GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: That will be the wrong grenade.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: But that's an analogy.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: One thing Eric that.BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . in fact, you know some of these people should get out and make it a two-man race?BOLLING: I think they should.WILLIAMS: Well then it's not just like.GUILFOYLE: He's just saying that.WILLIAMS: . what he was saying --BOLLING: No, no.PERINO: No, no.BOLLING: Kimberly is right. If --GUILFOYLE: He wants the votes --BOLLING: He wants to stay in --GUILFOYLE: He wants to vote in Florida and he wants them to --BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: He'll just said OK, sort of suggesting he'll do the same thing in Ohio. If you let me take Florida, I've got the best chance to take the state from him. Then I will put it for you because you got the best chance.WILLIAMS: But I think there are people --GUILFOYLE: . to take the state from him in Ohio.WILLIAMS: The reason I don't understand that logic is that people drop out and you get the two-man race. There are lots of people including Cruz who said --BOLLING: He's not suggesting anybody.GUILFOYLE: No, he's not doing that.WILLIAMS: The two-man race. He can beat Trump.BOLLING: He didn't say --GUILFOYLE: No, he's broad dealing it.WILLIAMS: No.GUILFOYLE: He's like, oh let up Florida, I let you have Ohio.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: We've had a couple of candidates over the last two election cycles. We had John McCain who suspended his candidacy to go, to the bank bailout, (inaudible). And then we had Mitt Romney who just didn't have a lot of fight in him. And now we have Marco Rubio who says he wants to be president, but vote for John Kasich in Ohio. Marco Rubio needs Ohio. If he wants to become illegitimate, but --GUILFOYLE: I think people should ask for voters if they want to win for them to vote for them and not be like seeking a vote to somebody else.BOLLING: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: If you're in race, stay in the race and say vote for me --WILLIAMS: I think a lot of people are thinking brokered convention --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: All right, your moment.WILLIAMS: Well, this is a little out of keeping with my friends here at the table because this is upsetting to me. This happen, take a look at this at this video from Fayetteville, North Carolina on Wednesday night at a Trump rally. We see that somebody just sucker punch this protester. He is being walked out by officials, hits them. The police don't do anything. They keep escorting the guy out. The guy -- a friend even, doesn't do anything, just looked at the older man who hit this guy. And you know, I remember when Kimberly came back from Detroit, we were talking about this trump rallies are, wow, intense. But it's not only that. You know what, I mean, you got to stop and think about this. We saw the charges were filed by Michelle Fields, a reporter, against one of Trump's top aides, allegedly grabbing the reporter because she was asking a pleasant or different question, I don't know, at a Trump rally. Here's Trump responding.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake. We have some protesters who are bad dudes. They have done bad things. They are swinging, they are really dangerous. And they get in there, and they start hitting people and we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people not only the loudness, the loudness have in mind, but doing serious damage. And if they're going to be taken out, I'll be honest. I mean, we have to run something.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Now the guy who punched the protester in North Carolina, when he was interviewed later he said, next time, we might have to kill him.BOLLING: And then he was arrested.WILLIAMS: I -- well --GUTFELD: Which is important -- I mean, it's understood that he is arrested.WILLIAMS: Finally.GUTFELD: But there is something going on here. It happens with any kind of major phenomenon. You will see -- you'll see some certain patterns. Because violence essentially is a dumb contagion, it happens when people feel emotion. And I've always argue against emotions. You're seeing intimidating threats against anchors by people in the Trump campaign. You see physical violence at rallies, you see a man handling of a reporter, Michelle Fields. You have Trump talking about opening this liberal law -- these libel laws to protect feelings. What you're seeing here is kind of a mob mentality. And we have to ask ourselves, Donald -- actually Donald Trump has to ask himself. He's got to get in front of this and stop this before something happens or received -- stop happen in St. Louis right now. It may happen in Chicago. He's got to talk to people and try to attempt this stuff down. He's got to address the people in his staff that are pulling women around. And it's not something you get over. You don't get over a reporter getting pooled, you know if that leaves bruises. I don't know how you get over it.WILLIAMS: I don't think you get over the right to protest, the right to free speech. I think this is, you know, the right of the American people, and so. But the people in the trump rallies are so passion, so -- and it also gets racial, you know, it was an older white man punching this black man.GUTFELD: You can't be a slave to emotion and that's what's happening. It's not authoritarian impulse.WILLIAMS: Dana?PERINO: Well, you know, I was thinking back to the McCain campaign in 2008. And there was somebody, and I think it was in Arizona, and there was a racial slur against President Obama that was hurl. Then I remember how John McCain stood up and look, we are not for that, OK? So there are -- there is passion. There's a lot of emotion, but I also think that you also have to deal with facts. And you have to think about, if this is was any other campaign, how would any of us or anybody else cover it? Because it -- you know, when things happen, it is news.WILLIAMS: Eric.BOLLING: So, first of all, Michelle Fields is a very good friend of mine. She was on ""Cash'in"" every single week since the day I took over the show; very, very good friend. That said I was spoken to her. I saw the video. And there is, you know, they are saying -- now if you listen, Michelle said she's not sure who actually grabbed her. And the Washington Post reporter is the one who said it was Corey Lewandowski. I think calmer heads prevail for right now. First of all, Michelle should never be man-handle, period.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: I mean, if someone -- if a secret service agent was moving her side and something happen, that's one thing. If Corey Lewandowski did grab her, he owns her an apology.GUTFELD: Yeah. That's true.BOLLING: Absolutely.GUTFELD: She'll get fired.GUILFOYLE: Well --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I mean, the C-Span, the new C-Span tape shows pretty clearly, pulling forward. I knew the previous tape --BOLLING: I saw that.GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah. Did you see the news tape?BOLLING: I did --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Even the Breitbart site is admitting that it looked -- it appears that he went forward.BOLLING: OK. Listen, I did see it. But look, again, if he did it, he --GUILFOYLE: There's a police investigation. They're going --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Can I just -- we have one point --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Have you noticed that anyone who is a pro-Trump supporter is now being attacked by protesters, being attacked by liberal media, being attacked establishment media, and being attacked by other campaigns.WILLIAMS: Attacked?BOLLING: Yes. They're low income -- they're low information.WILLIAMS: Oh, you mean, you mean.BOLLING: . voters. They're racist.WILLIAMS: You don't mean physically.BOLLING: You just -- yeah. You're saying there's a lot of racism going on. My point is --WILLIAMS: No, no. I don't know.BOLLING: If you don't like --WILLIAMS: I know about that --BOLLING: If you don't like Marco Rubio or John Kasich or Ted Cruz, you don't call -- it's not common to call their supporters racist, low information voters and delusional.WILLIAMS: Oh you say -- no, no.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: That's a fair point. But however, you have a candidate that is saying, wouldn't it be great to punch somebody in the face and then somebody punches somebody in the face.WILLIAMS: Yeah, he did say that and then he said you know --GUTFELD: Which I'm not for.WILLIAMS: You notice in his response, he doesn't start out with the problem of people being punched. He stars out by saying these protesters, some of them are rude.BOLLING: KG, do you want to get in here?GUILFOYLE: Yes, thank you. I want to do my favorite moment.BOLLING: So say it there.GUILFOYLE: I thought the debate was a very good and informative. And this is was the one that I've checked, and this is about the tone of the GOP debate, and just making a suggestion that this would be good if it continues going forward like this, with possibility. Here's Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We're all on this together. We're going to come up with solutions. We're going to find the answer to things, and so far, I cannot believe how civil it's been up here.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: And there's a lot of discussion that it was much more civil last night. It kind to bring this goes also with what you were saying before that there's going to have to be, you know, different attitude, approach, some apology, things like that going forward to try to work together, consensus for the party. Before you know it, it's going to be July.GUTFELD: Yeah. And could it get uglier. And we don't want it to get uglier, do we? But we -- it could. It really could. We're watching tempers flare everywhere. Not just between left and right, between right and right. And until we actually kind of like speak honestly about what's going on, it's going to get bad.BOLLING: Thoughts?WILLIAMS: I worry about it, you know, I just -- because I think that Greg is honest. I think it's -- I don't get the sense. I mean, I often, sometimes I think why the Black Lives Matter is always protesting Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. But anybody who shows up and when there's other at Trump rallies, I think they get, you know, it is terrible to me.PERINO: I'm going to pick up on something, can we just said this just not on the tone, but I think, partly because the tone was different. Then you did ended up with a lot more information and in-depth on all sorts of issues. And you found out who had a great command of the facts and of the understanding of how a program works with the core set of beliefs is. You heard on immigration, trade, in particular, social security, I thought that was eliminating the Israel conversation. Cuba, on and on, I thought that -- you just had a lot more chance to hear from all four of them, and I maintain that. If you took a little element that you like from each of these four candidates and put them together into one person, it would be the absolute perfect candidate. And the thing on civility is if the republicans decide to make this election about issues, then it has a chance of winning in November. If they make it about personal attacks against Hillary Clinton, it's probably a sure way to lose.BOLLING: All right. We got to leave it right there. Directly ahead, our nation pays tribute to former First Lady Nancy Reagan, who was laid to rest this afternoon in California, more from that very moving funeral service when we come right back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(singing)(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let me share with you today a letter he wrote to Nancy on their first Christmas together in the White House: ""There could be no life for me without you. Browning asked, 'How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.' For me, there is no way to count. I love the whole gang of you with all my love, lucky me.""(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: It was an emotional day in Simi Valley, California, as mourners gathered to say their final farewell to Nancy Reagan, who passed away on Sunday at the age of 94. The former first lady was laid to rest next to her husband at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.And Kimberly, I'm going to go to you first. I want to just pick up on something. Peggy Noonan was a speech writer for Ronald Reagan and became a very close friend of Nancy Reagan, and she wrote a remembrance about her today, and just a couple of lines I picked out. She called her her darling friend. She said that Nancy Reagan's protectiveness of Ronald Reagan was a patriotic act and that Nancy Reagan seemed to be awed by her own life, which I thought was an interesting way to sum it up.GUILFOYLE: It's very sweet. Peggy is such a great writer. She really captures moments and people. And it's true. I mean, she really tried to be selfless and to be able to serve the country well by protecting and taking care of her husband. Very loyal, very devoted.And really, one of the greatest love stories of all time. I think everybody kind of, you know, feels that way with the letters that they used to write back and forth. And she didn't make it about her. She did what she thought was the right thing to do. And a woman of principle and character and patriotism.PERINO: Juan, at funerals like this for great American leaders, people put aside politics for the day and get together. And you saw it in that row there. A lot of people from opposite sides of the aisle but everyone there to pay tribute.WILLIAMS: Yes. You saw the Carters. You saw Michelle Obama, Nancy Pelosi. So I mean, you get that kind of across-the-aisle thing going.But I think that there's a moment here that's American, Dana. I think it's like the Americans.I also plugged into the idea of women celebrating a woman. I thought this was very telling to me. It looked to me like a celebration of a successful American woman and one who had been a role model. I don't care who you are, what your politics are.PERINO: Yes. Eric Bolling, any thoughts?BOLLING: Quickly, so many beautiful things have been said about Nancy Reagan over the last week since she's passed. Nothing to add there other than a cool story I heard today. That she had planned that funeral service six months ago, down to the music, which readings the mass was going to have, the chairs, the flowers. She was just so meticulous about everything, and especially about her husband.PERINO: And in fact, Greg, I saw a person that you know, John Heubusch ...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ... who runs the Reagan Library, doing a tribute to her today. A lot of personal heartache. It's because she came a friend. So she was a strict...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ... driver of the library. She was also their friend.GUTFELD: Amazing force and in a small package. But it's a testament to how strong women are generally. She lived a good decade after the death of the love of her life. And women can do that. Men cannot. When men lose a spouse, because they have no -- they're not expert at creating social networks. They end up dying. And women, however, are so -- have that innate power to socialize. That they live longer, that they create friendships and networks. She's like a lot of women that you know and we all know, women, yes, that are like this, that are so -- seem stronger than anything, even in their ninth decade.PERINO: All right. A great tribute, everybody. That was nice.Don't go away, because ""Facebook Friday,"" that's up next.GUILFOYLE: Oh, thank goodness.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC: ""HOGAN'S HEROES THEME"")GUTFELD: ""Hogan's Heroes,"" very good.It's Friday. Time to answer your questions posted on our Facebook page. This might be the best one so far. We'll start -- go around the table. From John L.: ""What is the one thing, Dana, that you did in high school that you are embarrassed about?""PERINO: I still get a sick feeling in my stomach when I think about it. And I was just telling Charlie Hurt the other night during special election coverage that I was the kind of person that -- I was a kid, I would wake up and assume that I was in trouble. Even though I hadn't even gotten out of bed yet. I'm just that kind of person.So Tracy Schilling and I, we were going to try to skip school one day. And I wrote a note, forged a note, like a doctor's note or something...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ... to get us out of school, and we got caught. And I had to do detention. And I thought I hadn't -- I thought my parents didn't know about it.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And that was, like, in September, because it was nice out. That's why we wanted to take off school. But then at Christmas time, one of my gifts was a framed copy of my detention notice.GUILFOYLE: I'm so surprised by this.PERINO: It was mortifying. It was horrible. I think that's really the only thing I could say.GUTFELD: That is nothing.GUILFOYLE: That's really bad. I'm shocked, because we were, like...GUTFELD: OK. Yours?GUILFOYLE: What, something bad that I did?GUTFELD: Yes. This is the whole point of Facebook. Everybody has to answer the same question.PERINO: Yes. In high school, did you do anything that you're embarrassed about?BOLLING: Embarrassing.GUILFOYLE: No!PERINO: I can't believe I fessed up.GUTFELD: Wait. You've never did anything bad in -- anything bad in high school?GUILFOYLE: No.GUTFELD: Really?GUILFOYLE: Really.GUTFELD: Nothing.GUILFOYLE: Ask them. Call Mercy High School. They have a whole thing dedicated to me there.GUTFELD: Mercy San Francisco?GUILFOYLE: Yes. All girls. Private Catholic school. No. Perfect attendance. Straight ""A's."" No. No drugs, no smoking, no bad behavior.WILLIAMS: Really?GUTFELD: All right.How about you, Eric?BOLLING: I have a really bad one.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: A really embarrassing one. So in the summer, my hair tends to get a little bit lighter from the sun, little streaks. I really liked it.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. Sun-In?BOLLING: I tried Sun-In. I tried.GUILFOYLE: Oh, no. That's your bad thing?BOLLING: It was the '80s. And it was a product called Sun-In, and it was a spray.PERINO: I used it.BOLLING: Well, I put some Sun-In...PERINO: Then went outside?BOLLING: ... went out in the sun, and I ended up, like, white hair. And then the only thing you could do is wait for your hair to grow out. And so I had, like, really bad hair.GUILFOYLE: OK. I used Aquanet. Maybe that was bad. It's probably not good for the air. I can't think of one.GUTFELD: I can't -- Juan.WILLIAMS: You used what?GUILFOYLE: Aquanet.GUTFELD: That's hairspray.GUILFOYLE: Right. But it was very bad. I think it's not a good one. It can take the permanent marker off of floors if you spray. It's got to be - - I mean...PERINO: My grandma had that.WILLIAMS: Wow, I don't know. I feel like such a degenerate compared to you guys.GUTFELD: I know, I'm...WILLIAMS: You guys are Rangers (ph).GUTFELD: Go ahead.WILLIAMS: I mean, it's just about here -- you know, I basically looked like a dandelion in high school. I was, like, really skinny, and I had a big puffy afro. So I looked like that.But I mean, I did things like -- I remember once I was captain of my basketball team. We came down here to New York City to play a game. And I got in a fight in front of my mother. I really -- she was so embarrassed.And then another time, of course, I got thrown out of the girls' dorms a bunch of time. Right?GUILFOYLE: Well, that makes sense.WILLIAMS: OK. All right. I think the most embarrassing one...BOLLING: That was like last week.WILLIAMS: I wish.But the most embarrassing one was so I was, you know, supposed to give the address, as the president of the student body, to the parents, everybody at graduation. And I can't get the words right, feces and faces. And the -- so the school president and everybody is like, ""You are not going to screw this up."" And they were like, you know, ""Juan, this would be very embarrassing. You don't understand. You don't even know what this word means, but don't screw it up.""And I stopped. I couldn't -- I couldn't do it, because I was so afraid.GUILFOYLE: What happened to my question I was supposed to get?PERINO: That was the question.GUILFOYLE: No. There was another one. Is that a joke one?BOLLING: You get the questions in advance?GUTFELD: What?BOLLING: Busted. What happened?GUILFOYLE: What happened?GUTFELD: I don't know.My -- OK, so my cringe-worthy thing, I was so mean to a teacher. Like when you don't know -- I was so mean to a teacher.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: I don't like that.GUTFELD: Manuel Foho (ph). He was a refugee from Cuba. He came over from Cuba. He escaped Castro in the '50s. Spanish teacher at Sierra High School, the sweetest man in the world. But as a 15- or 16-year-old, you just don't know any better, and you're a complete jerk -- I haven't changed. But I was -- I put snails in front of his podium. Little snails in front of his podium. And he walked in, and he slipped and he fell.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. This is so funny. Suzanne Somers: ""I went to Mercy High School, too, and I never did anything bad either except get pregnant.""BOLLING: In high school?GUTFELD: You had to call a friend. You had to call a friend to get something bad.BOLLING: I would say she -- I would say she beat you.GUTFELD: Anyway, Manuel -- Manuel Foho (ph) is not alive anymore. But if his family is, I'm sorry.GUILFOYLE: I don't know. I thought I was supposed to get asked -- somebody asked, wrote and asked do I like fat old bald men.GUTFELD: Bald men?GUILFOYLE: Fat old bald men. Sure.GUTFELD: I don't know what that means.GUILFOYLE: I don't know. I think it was a joke from Amanda.GUTFELD: All right. You have -- I don't know any more.All right. Up next, President Obama played comedian in chief at last night's state dinner with the Canadian prime minister. You're going to hear some of his wisecracks. Wisecracks. What did I say?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: The glitz, the glamor all in high gear last night as the president and the first lady hosted a state dinner honoring the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau. President Obama and the prime minister kept the mood light, telling some jokes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it's fair to say that here in America, you may well be the most popular Canadian named Justin.JUSTIN TRUDEAU, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: One of our most popular exports to the United States -- and I need to you stop teasing him -- has been another Justin. Leave it to a Canadian to reach international fame with a song called ""Sorry.""OBAMA: Canadians from British Columbia to New Brunswick have so far rejected the idea of building a wall to keep out your southern neighbors. We appreciate that.TRUDEAU: May the special connection between our two countries continue to flourish in the years to come, and may my gray hair come in at a much slower rate than yours has.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: And President Obama also joked that it was 44 years ago that President Nixon, attending a dinner in Canada said, ""Oh, you know what? Here's a toast to the future prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau."" So that -- that toast came true.Eric, what's the fanciest dinner you ever went to?BOLLING: Every year, Juan, every year the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I love it to death.GUILFOYLE: We love it.BOLLING: My favorite night of the year.WILLIAMS: Really? I thought you hated Washington.GUILFOYLE: No, we love it.BOLLING: Adore Washington.GUTFELD: Bolling, you hate the establishment, but you like the establishment dinner.BOLLING: It's a wonderful dinner. They beat the hell out of each other. Right?GUILFOYLE: It's a super fun party. We have a great time.WILLIAMS: Now, did you have -- did you host fancy dinners?GUILFOYLE: Of course. Of course.So one of my fond memories would be when I entertained Prince Charles and Camilla when they came for their first official visit to the United States. And one of the three cities that they stopped in was San Francisco. So we had a number, like four days of events that I attend and did with them.And he, Prince Charles, super personable. Very warm. I was seated next to him. And he let me eat off his plate, because he didn't finish his dinner and his dessert. And yes, he had apple tart. And I remember, he said to me, ""I wish I had even more apple tart to give you."" Very nice. Very nice.WILLIAMS: Dana.PERINO: The fanciest dinner?WILLIAMS: The fanciest dinner.PERINO: I was very fortunate. I got to go to several state dinners that were hosted at the White House. The one I remember the most, the queen of England one, although I was at the kids' table downstairs. But the one with the prime minister of India. That was fancy and beautiful. I thought that was great.I would just -- I think that these dinners are really good. I love the Canadians, just to say. Every time I've been to Canada, I think it's fantastic. I mean, it's beautiful and amazing. And also for President Obama's speech. It was really -- it was well given. But with the jokes this election season, they write themselves.WILLIAMS: They're great.PERINO: They're hilarious.WILLIAMS: Greg, who would invite you to a fancy dinner?GUTFELD: No one. My idea of a fancy dinner is just a dark room with a hungry man on one of those folding tables, watching my favorite shows.PERINO: You mean the TV dinner?GUTFELD: TV dinner, off the tray. The Hungry Man.PERINO: Right. Right. That's not actually -- no.GUTFELD: Actually, you might...GUILFOYLE: Dana, you uninvited him to Thanksgiving dinner.GUTFELD: I know.GUILFOYLE: You invited, remember?GUTFELD: I got invited and not invited.GUILFOYLE: Remember that?GUTFELD: Well, no -- I had dinner with Reagan. Ronald Reagan at Bob Terrell's (ph) house. Except I was in the kitchen with Secret Service.WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh. I'll tell you, we were once, my wife and I went to dinner with the mayor, and he put his hand on her leg.""One More Thing""...GUILFOYLE: Which mayor?GUTFELD: Which mayor?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: All right. It's time now for ""One More Thing"" -- Greg.GUTFELD: Hey, don't forget: My show is on tomorrow night, 10 p.m. Should be fun. We're going to talk about everything. The people often come up to me and they ask, where did Donald Trump get his great vision for America? This is February.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Would you ever write a speech -- that's a good question -- would you ever write a speech for a presidential candidate?GUTFELD: Yes. If I -- if I firmly believed that this person could actually make this world a better place and make America what it used to be, I would leave my job and do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: You're welcome, Donald! February last year.PERINO: Good-bye, Greg.GUTFELD: Yes, I'm out.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: Your work is done here.GUILFOYLE: Yes, you're -- yes.BOLLING: I thought he took that from Ronald Reagan.GUTFELD: No, he stole it from me.GUILFOYLE: From him. But you said you were going to do that for me, too, if I ran for mayor. So...GUTFELD: I would. I would write for you in a second.BOLLING: Make New York great again.GUILFOYLE: Right?GUTFELD: Safe again.GUILFOYLE: Somebody's got to do it.GUTFELD: Make New York safe again.GUILFOYLE: Safe again.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Stop and Frisk back on the books, not canceled.OK, Dana.PERINO: All right. You want a romantic Friday ""One More Thing""?GUILFOYLE: Mm-hmm.PERINO: Check this out from Brazil. A south American penguin swam 5,000 miles to Brazil to be reunited with the man who saved his life in 2011. This is amazing. He was a little one. He was all covered in oil.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh. You're kidding.PERINO: And Mr. Souza took care of him. And then, about 11 months later, the penguin went out into the world. But he comes back every year 5,000 miles, and they spend a little quality time together.GUTFELD: I don't buy this.BOLLING: They know because it's...PERINO: It's true. It's in The Daily Mail.BOLLING: ... it's black and has a white stripe?GUILFOYLE: Any time we have Daily Mail stories.BOLLING: The Daily Mail.GUILFOYLE: I rely on them for our segment.PERINO: And biologists, they've never seen anything like it.GUILFOYLE: Excuse me, everyone. To add to that happy, whatever, dating Friday night advice, how about this? Chocolate makes you smarter. Oh, ""Food Court""!(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: Kimberly's Food Court(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. Chocolate makes you smarter. Also, it makes your memory and abstract thinking improve.So I'm going to help by -- if I eat all of this, Dana gave me these chocolates. I still have some left. They're Edward Mark (ph). The family has them. Chris and Dana Edwards, and some other siblings. And let me tell you something, these are so delicious, and they make you smarter. They have little salted things on the top.PERINO: A great family-run business in Pittsburgh.GUILFOYLE: Juan.WILLIAMS: All right. So public service ""One More Thing.""
