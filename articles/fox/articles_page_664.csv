This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund, doing favors for oppressive regimes and many others and really, many, many others in exchange for cash.HILLARY CLINTON, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I know Donald hates it when anyone points out how hollow his sales pitch really is. He's going after me personally because he has no answers on the substance.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton trading fire today both on economic policy and ethics. Let's bring in our panel: editor in chief of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham, A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Laura, how do you compare Trump and Clinton's speeches both in terms of policy and in terms of their political effect?LAURA INGRAHAM, LIFEZETTE.COM: I think it was a stark contrast in this way, Chris. Hillary Clinton's been around public life, national public life, for 25 years not counting Arkansas. And in her speech she really didn't make an aggressive pitch for her record and why her record indicates her strength as a president. Foreign policy, she didn't tick off we did this, this, this, and this. On economic policy, she was around when a lot of the decisions were made. If she had the secret to reviving the economy, maybe she should have shared it with Barack Obama and not just spring it on the nation on January 20th.So I think she, she went after Trump's temperament, Trump University, all that usual stuff. But she didn't make the case for why her record indicates that she should be the nominee.And Trump on the other hand comes out and he says, look, this is what she's done. She's part of the corrupt regime of Washington, D.C. I am going to lead the country in a new path for renewal in our economy and foreign policy. And I think he was pretty specific on regulatory reform, on tax reform, on the issue of immigration and of course foreign policy. I think it was a stark contrast.Obviously he got very hopped up on the Clinton Foundation. But I think a lot of that cuts right to the heart of corruption and what people think of Washington. I think he had a good performance today, and I think Hillary Clinton is going to do what she's going to do, but she can't run on record, because the record is really shoddy.WALLACE: One of the things that Trump did today that was interesting is he made an explicit appeal almost at start of his speech to Bernie Sanders supporters. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money. That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders voters to join our movement, so together we can fix the system for all Americans so important.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: A.B., after a couple of I think it's fair to say rocky weeks, did Trump at least begin to stabilize his campaign for president today?A.B. STODDARD, THE HILL: It's an interesting comparison. You know, compared to what, but Trump has a great day. It was a very well-written speech. It was very focused. It was substantive. I thought the direct appeal on trade and corruption to Bernie Sanders voters was very shrewd. I thought he gave Republicans every reason to believe that he's serious about coming up with a good contrast against Hillary Clinton and taking it to, right to her. It's a message that he has to stay on, but it was a good message for him today.WALLACE: Charles, you were critical of Clinton's speech yesterday, saying that she offered platitudes instead of policies, the future lies ahead. She was much more specific today in terms today of what her economic program would be. Were you at all mollified?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: No, I but I rarely am by Hillary Clinton. I think the fact is she doesn't really have a program. She doesn't really have a vision. She does small ball. Her appeal is she's going to patch the safety net of the welfare state. She's not -- she doesn't offer large ideas like Sanders or large hope the way that Obama did in 2008. She basically says I'll fix stuff. People who are hurt, I will try to compensate, use the government to compensate. For example she says the coal miners will be driven into penury and unemployment, but the government will provide some billions of dollars to soften the blow. That's basically what her appeal is.It is extremely uninspiring, which is why, as I said yesterday, she had a line where she said I believe in an America that moves towards the future, which, I mean, is as empty as you can get.WALLACE: So let me push back for a minute, and you can argue how good the program it is, but she did talk about infrastructure. She talked about clean energy. She talked about manufacturing, restoring those jobs, stopping people from moving overseas. I'm not saying that she's got the new secret sauce, but it's a program.KRAUTHAMMER: Infrastructure, green energy -- Obama has been talking about that for seven and a half years. We have the slowest growth of any recovery after the Second World War. We're under one percent -- even the Democrats in the primary campaign argued against, criticized, inveighed against a government that's leaving the middle class squeezed and helpless. That's Democrats speaking.So all of the stuff we've heard before. We had the stimulus, we had all of these attempts under Obama. And here we have a stagnant economy and a suffering middle class. There is no argument that she can make that sounds remotely visionary. And anything new, this is Obama redux. If you liked his economy you're going to like her. That's her problem. There's no escaping it.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Some interesting news to tell you about regarding Mark Zuckerberg's meeting this week with a group of conservatives and charges of political bias at Facebook. I will be there on Wednesday at this meeting. The company reached out to me to take part along with several others including the TheBlaze Glenn Beck and Arthur Brooks, he's the president of the American Enterprise Institute. The meeting was scheduled to address claims by former employees at the social network manipulates its trending news feed as suppressed conservative news from it. In a statement last week, Zuckerberg said that the network found no evidence to support those claims, but would continue to investigate, so that is ongoing. But in the meantime, Eric, they said they would like to have this meeting, so we are going head out there on Wednesday. This is -- I go to you first because I think that you are the most active on Facebook and especially in terms of news engagement with viewers and your fans. This has not been the news feed that people see, this is news trend which basic added later, and they're trying to deal with that portion of it because it possibly it wasn't as objective as an algorithm would be if you add human thought into it.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: So first of all, congratulations, that's an honor. That's a fantastic honor to be -- to be brought to that meeting. I think Facebook needs to get in front of this, and here is why. You are very active on both Facebook and Twitter, ""Cashin' In"" on the Saturday morning show, like very active during the show. And on Twitter, the #CashinIn trends every single Saturday morning. It doesn't trend a long time, but it trends nationally every, so far, every Saturday in 2016. Also on Twitter, they had a political hashtag top 10 for 2015, in wake up America which is a brand I put in there very, very right wing, was number six at the top 10 in all, in the whole country in 2015. The reason I pointing this out, we have never trended on Facebook once --PERINO: On Facebook?BOLLING: Not once. And I'm equally as engaged on Facebook as I am on Twitter, so that would indicate that there's a difference. Either they are use using a different algorithm which could be an explanation or there's more human input into their, into whoever -- into how they are dictating the trending topics.PERINO: Which is probably something accumulated relatively easy to fix, I mean I'm not, I don't know their business. I guess I'm going to learn more about it, but if the problem is that they need -- that they have concerned of bias by people who have been hired, then to me that is maybe handled by a management solution rather than a big hoopla.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah, management or personnel decision or -- and perhaps they move to a model that is a little bit more neutral and it doesn't have bias embedded in it like Twitter does, because you see the two, the differences like Eric points out between what happens on his show on one social media platform versus the other. So it's an interesting contrast between the two, and now with the emerging of the story coming forward, I mean there's great questions obviously, that you can ask them. And then it's really going to be about the results afterward in terms of do we see then a difference because there's been a spotlight put on their social media platform.PERINO: I find it -- my interaction on Facebook and Twitter is very different. On Twitter it's a lot of news and political stuff. But if I tend to post things that are about politics or like when I promote the Stirewalt/Perino Podcast on Facebook versus Twitter, the engagement was totally different. Like on Facebook, nobody cares about anything but my dog.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah.PERINO: How do you feel about my dog?GUTFELD: I don't know.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I don't --PERINO: Any advice for me for the meeting?GUTFELD: I don't know why you are so surprised by Facebook, you know, (inaudible) away from conservative issues -- Al Gore rhythm?(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Think about it people. Think about it. I only go on Facebook for one reason.GUILFOYLE: Make sense.GUTFELD: It does make sense, Kimberly. I've been thinking about this. I only go on Facebook to see how homely my high school classmates have become, and then I go and like their adult children.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: OK.GUTFELD: It's just to creeps them out a little bit. I have the bigger concern. When you go there, I don't care about this issue as much as I care about artificial intelligence.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: So when you go in there and you're sitting in this meeting and they offer you a brand cupcake or whatever they serve at these stupid places, ask them what happens when Facebook develops its own hive mind.GUILFOYLE: What does mean?GUTFELD: That it reaches singularity. What it mean -- when it becomes smarter than actual people and when their IQ, to collect by used of assets human intelligence, we are in trouble. Have you thought about that, when we are enslaved by Facebook?GUILFOYLE: Maybe you can FaceTime Greg, and this little robot friends into this meeting.GUTFELD: It is going to happen, Kimberly. You can laugh at me now, but it's all going to happen.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Can I jump in with just a touch of advice? I know we have to get Juan in here, but maybe just ask Zuckerberg, why not just go to a purely numeric algorithm for trending. Just take the human element out -- sorry Greg.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Take the human element out of it .GUTFELD: You crazy.BOLLING: And just go with -- however you want to do it, whether there's acceleration, where high acceleration puts in it .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . a trending topic over a course of time. Whatever you want to do, but keep it more numeric than ideological.PERINO: That's what I'm saying. I think there might be an easier fix, either management one or technological one, possibly. Liberals don't necessarily have this kind of problem, Juan?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: No, I think --PERINO: What do you think they would say if the shoe was on the other foot?WILLIAMS: Oh I think it would be a different conversation, but a similar one in the sense that people are very sensitive in this age when they feel like their point of view is not being recognized. And conservatives have had a much larger complaint about mainstream, lamestream (ph) media than liberals have. But in the case of Facebook, Facebook has now become so big that it is mentioned to me, they determine and, you know, what you hear from, hear from Eric is really true. If they're setting who gets the click and whose website is hot, and there was a study of by a few I just saw in the research that indicated they are the number one source that sends people to mobile articles. In other words, if you are on your mobile device and you look, you find something to read, you go to Facebook. Facebook is pointing out what is interesting, hot, trending, et cetera. I think, by the way, Facebook is very different than Twitter, in my experience. Twitter tends to be more .GUILFOYLE: Mean.WILLIAMS: . of the moment and hot, hot, hot. Facebook, people tend to be there for a while and they're searching around.PERINO: But --WILLIAMS: And one last thing I say on this point is I think that when you look at something like the algorithm versus the human input, I think it's all human input. I think that, you know --BOLLING: You think Twitter is using the human input too?WILLIAMS: No, no. I think Twitter is much less. But I think that all of it has to have some human input and for us very clear reason to my mind. It's useless if you just stick with the numerical numbers, because then people will put, people will juice it. They will find a way just to pile on their perspective --GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: It's like #JustinBieber, it's always like the entire --WILLIAMS: Yeah. It was just, yeah --GUTFELD: The one difference though that we haven't talked about is anonymity. When you're on Facebook, generally, your -- it's your name.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: That makes you closer to your character, as a person, I believe. When you go on Twitter and you're dealing with people who have fake names, they can do anything and be anything that they want. That's the difference.PERINO: Here's another thing that you mentioned last week, but I got a couple more numbers. I thought it was worth bringing up again. So, on the news feed side of things, Fox News in 2015, so it was just last year, was the number one brand on Facebook, and that was not an objective number. That was purely subjective just based on the numbers and the -- in terms of the engagement we have with the audience, the shareable content. We get 100 to 200 million unique users a month because of our work on Facebook. Guess who the number two brand is, anybody? It's not a competitor of ours. It's the WWE.GUTFELD: Of course.PERINO: I mean that's, I feel like we are doing pretty good.GUTFELD: Yes.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: We share a number of things in common.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: The other thing --GUTFELD: A little showmanship.PERINO: There's one other .GUILFOYLE: Yes, actually.PERINO: . controversy surrounding this.GUTFELD: Attraction, attracted people.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I'm going to make my point. So last week, when this was a really big news story, there was a suggestion by some that the government gets involved, and I'm not for that. I don't think that the government needs to regulate this private company. Any other thoughts?BOLLING: Stay out.GUTFELD: Yeah, absolutely. That's crazy.BOLLING: Stay out.GUTFELD: That's crazy.PERINO: All right --GUILFOYLE: That will only make it worse, let's be honest.PERINO: We have another one story to get into this A-block, are you ready to make a pivot?GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: OK, come with me.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Last week, ""Washington Post"" Associate Editor Bob Woodward made headlines when he said the paper assigned a team of 20 to look into Donald Trump's past. On Fox News Sunday he said, ""The equivalent effort will be made on Hillary Clinton."" Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"" HOST: You got 20 people on her.BOB WOODWARD, ""THE WASHINGTON POST"" ASSOCIATE EDITOR: Yeah. Well, it's not necessarily the number of people as who's working on it. And --WALLACE: So you got smarter --(LAUGHTER)WOODWARD: No, no, but, but, you know -- believe me, you know the goal here is the best obtainable version of the truth. You can't find out everything. Lots of work needs to be done.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: You are having a moment, (inaudible)?GUTFELD: No, I would defend ""Washington Post,"" because -- you got to ask yourself, who is more interesting? Hillary is like ""Love Actually,"" you see her like 500 times a year, you already know the story. And Donald Trump is ""Deadpool,"" you know, he's as exciting character that comes out of nowhere that says what -- you know, everything on his mind, just release the amazing special effects. And you can't blame ""Washington Post"" for wanting to sell copies, because Trump's just -- as same way networks are trying to get eyeballs. Who would do that .GUILFOYLE: Well, the Clinton --GUTFELD: . by showing Trump.GUILFOYLE: Come on.GUTFELD: And one more thing.GUILFOYLE: Clinton got boring, Greg. Let's be honest.GUTFELD: You know -- I believe --GUILFOYLE: If you actually tell the truth about everything they've been involved in and their private lives .GUTFELD: You know what I mean, you know, we've heard the story --GUILFOYLE: . and their girlfriends are.GUTFELD: We've heard the story so many times, except certain stories.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: But we've heard a lot of the same stuffs - but I agree.BOLLING: But if, if that's all they doing digging for facts, you know. But it seems like when they pull up the -- I guess it's relevant. The guy, the publicist --PERINO: John Miller.GUTFELD: I love John Miller.BOLLING: John Miller as --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Still the funniest scandal ever.BOLLING: Yeah --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: (inaudible) make a good point this weekend, with Hillary's scandals people -- that are injured or died -- Benghazi, but with Trump, his scandal it's just funny. It's just funny.GUILFOYLE: It's like a SNL skit.GUTFELD: Yeah. And you rather have the funny one than the harmful on, right?WILLIAMS: I know.PERINO: Juan, you used to be at ""The Washington Post"" --BOLLING: Yeah.PERINO: What do you think of the resources that they are dedicating? Do you imagine that they are pretty even over there?WILLIAMS: No. I don't, you know, I think this even have. I don't know. I think again, this goes back to conservative attention. Oh, somebody is not going to properly hear us or represent us. Hey, it's just what Greg said, nobody knows all about from him. He is not been in the political arena. Hillary Clinton has been here forever and her husband has been impeached. And people have made charges against Hillary Clinton going to back to her first attempt that proposing some health care solution, and people have said this about Hillary, that. I think there have been books written about her during her college years. So, I mean, it's a total apples and orange in comparison that's being forced by people who say, oh they're going to pick on the conservative here. I don't even know that he's a conservative, though.BOLLING: I just wish they would dig up that video of Hillary Clinton when they are pushing the '94 crime bill, before it was actually passed. She was out in the stump. She was stumping for the crime bill.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: And now she's pushed back so hard as a candidate for president against what happened in the past.GUTFELD: Now that her husband has to come out and defend the bill, but she's now --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Yes. But then when you get to our C-block today .GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: . you are going to wonder if they should disavow the crime bill, right.GUTFELD: That's a pretty good long speech.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: All right. Next, a tale of two commencement speeches one by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, the other by President Obama. Highlights from both of those when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: President Obama has had plenty of opportunity to voice his disapproval of Donald Trump and his agenda, but he may have taken some more shot at the presumptive GOP nominee yesterday at a graduation ceremony for students at Rutgers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: The world is more inter-connected than ever before, and it's becoming more connected every day. Building walls won't change that. If you are listening to today's political debate, you might wonder where the strain of anti-intellectualism came from. So class of 2016, let me be as clear as I can be. In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: OK now, he never mentioned Donald Trump by name, Juan, but he did start out with, hey, building walls. I guess he put -- he bring Trump in and talks about political discourse. And he says, ""Ignorance is not virtue."" Is he taking a shot at Trump there?WILLIAMS: I think that the entire speech, though, spoke to the idea that hey, it's not PC when you simply say here are the facts, here is what's really going on, and instead, people say let's defend the facts. I think he made the point in every area of your life, if you are having an operation you go to a guy who had a lot of experience as a doctor. But in somehow in our public experience, we say, oh, let's go to a guy who has no experience. I don't see how you can be talking about anybody but Trump at this moment.BOLLING: And should he -- we get around, but should he be taking shots at a commencement speech for young people at Rutgers, about to go out in the real world, should he be taking a political shot at the --WILLIAMS: I don't know that it was -- I think it has political, I think it has political power, if you are asking me that. But I think that it was an important message to say to these young people, you know what, the age of rationality is where our founding fathers came from and they believe in facts and honest dialogue. He also said you know what; you guys should never turn away Condi Rice. You should have people who disagree on campus; talk to them, use your language, test your critical thinking facility.BOLLING: What do you think?GUILFOYLE: That was only the good part.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: The part about Condi Rice -- (inaudible). But no, look, he's going to take his chance to take a shot. That was clearly a shot. It wasn't even like veiled or settled. It was very obvious. You know, when you talk about a wall. And then he basically was saying that the -- saying that Donald Trump isn't intellectual, isn't smart, ignorance isn't a virtue. I mean, I don't -- you don't get much like dirtier than that, but he's the president of the United States. I don't think he needs to even go there. It might be his personal opinion. I don't think he needs to even belittle like that to make the points that he wants to make to the students.BOLLING: President Obama at Rutgers, oh. It's quite a get for Rutgers.GUTFELD: Yeah. They deal for them, very exciting. Easy applause line, you go and to do a speech like that and you insult Trump. That's like a lead singer yelling, ""Hello, Cleveland, is anybody from Cleveland?"" When he's, you know, Cleveland, at that city. He knows he is going to get a response. This helps Trump. Anytime Obama says something bad about trump, that's like saying the Norwegian black metal is satanic. It's just heightens the appeal. But I would, I would be OK with Obama saying this, if he was against all forms of ignorance, but he's OK with non-thinking when it's about climate change. I get any politics, terror .BOLLING: Guns.GUTFELD: . economics .BOLLING: Guns.GUTFELD: . guns. And ask yourself, what kind of man, you know, can call out a candidate, obviously, but not Islamic terrorist.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: Interesting.GUILFOYLE: That's the problem.BOLLING: Dana, there are a couple studies, I think the ""Washington Examiner"" wrote up one, also Young America's Foundation, we found that in the top 100 schools by U.S. and news and world report universities. The top 10 commencement speakers were all liberal. The top 50, nine out of every ten were liberal -- 50, maybe six out of it to one. It's six out of ten or nine of every ten were liberal. Liberal commencement speakers are prevailing in American university.PERINO: Well, in American universities are mostly liberal. And I think you are starting to see that especially in the work force, OK? And one of the things that we are going to talk about on Wednesday is about young people and their political bias as they come forward. I appreciate the message that he said, ""You should talk to people you disagree with."" But that would have been interesting a few years ago from --GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: When they are working on all sorts of different problems like the stimulus package or ObamaCare. Remember, he didn't meet with John Boehner and McConnell for like a long time. It was like something like a record number of months. So, I'm not just a fan of political speeches for commencement addresses. I feel like those should be for the students, but I do also know it's where you get to make news. The one thing they did I thought that was really smart is, I think there was a contest. The reason he went to Rutgers is they had a sort of contest, which is, if you want President Obama to come speak at your university, you got to tell us why. And one of the things they did is they have the grandmother of the university president sent a letter, as well to President Obama, and he said that persuade him.BOLLING: There you go.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: One quick thing about the Obama thing, he did go after safe spaces and the fact that students don't like to hear from opposing voices. He has to understand that what created that climate is the very progressivism that he champions. The left created --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: The left created identity politics. He should have admitted that.BOLLING: All right. And in Michigan, graduates that hails their college were luckily weren't subjected to the political tirade. Instead, they got this sound advice from Supreme Justice Clarence Thomas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLARENCE THOMAS, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES: Do not hide your faith and your beliefs under a bushel basket, especially in this world that seems to have gone mad with political correctness. And your efforts to live them will help to form the fabric of a civil society and a free and prosperous nation where inherent equality and liberty are invaluable.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: There's a powerful speech.PERINO: Yes. And so, if your faith guides you and then you talk about that in public, it can be a little scary, because you realize it might not be a popular thing to say, necessarily. But then once you have said it and you get out in the world, you hear people say like thank you for living your faith. And I remember President Bush when he used to say -- he used to talk about his faith a lot, and I was the deputy press secretary for a long time, and I remember this one reporter from a major network, he used to just lose his mind behind the scenes when ever President Bush talked about his faith. It was just made him so mad. And he thought it was the wrong thing to do, but I actually thought it was a brave thing to do, and courageous, and a smart thing to do if that's how you live your life.BOLLING: And I do. And I -- it's, believe me, I talk about it all the time here. And it's, you know, it's not easy at times to do that, put it form --GUTFELD: That's actually I feel, I have no faith.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: It's like --BOLLING: Faith no more.GUTFELD: Faith no more.PERINO: And anybody talks about that too.GUTFELD: There you go, one of my favorite bands of all time. I think it's important that people do not hide their religious beliefs. I think it's integral, but at the same time, will you advance the same comfort somebody who doesn't have faith?PERINO: Who doesn't have faith, right?WILLIAMS: Well, here is the thing. I mean, first of all, I live my faith. In fact, I remember once during an interview with President Bush, in which I said, you know, help us to understand, because people pray for you for your success as leader of the nation. And I got in trouble back in NPR when they said, why are you saying that everybody prays for President Bush? And I said, well, in my church, we pray for the president of United States .GUTFELD: World leader.WILLIAMS: . every Sunday.GUILFOYLE: That's also they do in church.WILLIAMS: So, you know -- so, but you know, this to me that's, I think that's beyond politics. But I will say this, I'm so curious that around this table, Gregory, everybody is saying, oh, that first speech was so political and the second speech wasn't. I think they were both political speeches.BOLLING: I don't know, Juan.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I'll tell you exactly the second one said do not talk about grievance. Instead, focus on your life, your faith, your patriotism .GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: . and your constitution.BOLLING: But the politics even the first speech .WILLIAMS: Oh, please.BOLLING: . when he didn't name Trump, which you admit yourself .WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah --BOLLING: . that he was talking about Trump.WILLIAMS: Yeah, that's fine. You can talk about --PERINO: He called him ignorant.WILLIAMS: What? What was that?PERINO: He called him ignorant.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: He didn't call him ignorant. He said ignorance is not a virtue.GUILFOYLE: OK, so --WILLIAMS: And it's not. And by the way, I can't believe that you said the left is responsible for identity politics in America?GUTFELD: Yeah, no way. You can't believe that?WILLIAMS: No. It's unbelievable to me, because, gee, I think identity politics came from people who collected slavery and segregation. I mean that's pretty --BOLLING: All right. Let me get Kimberly in here.GUILFOYLE: I'm trying over here.BOLLING: Me, too.GUILFOYLE: Thank you. So, I think what was very interesting about Clarence Thomas, first of all, he's a man of few words, right? So he was able to get up here and speak and people wants to hear what he had to say. I like his emphasis on faith and belief, because in my personal opinion, the past eight years, we have seen under the Obama administration, they have used class warfare, and race and envy to divide the nation. They have in communities, when you see Ferguson and other places .WILLIAMS: Oh, I see, but Obama did --GUILFOYLE: . and they champion back. I didn't say that, Juan. You are really becoming infamous .WILLIAMS: Yes.GUILFOYLE: . and also ridiculous because you --WILLIAMS: Yes, that was ridiculous, infamous.GUILFOYLE: You put words in people's mouth and you paraphrase.WILLIAMS: You said President Obama --GUILFOYLE: I didn't say that. I said the administration, and it's true.WILLIAMS: OK.GUILFOYLE: Under Eric Holder and the unjustice (ph) department, this is part and parcel for what happened across this country. We did not come closer together as a country, we became more divided, and there was more loss of life and destruction of property from that race and identity politics.WILLIAMS: Because people speak out against injustice. You don't like it.GUILFOYLE: Well, there's one --WILLIAMS: It makes you uncomfortable.GUILFOYLE: No, it doesn't make me uncomfortable.WILLIAMS: You have to deal with the reality.GUILFOYLE: Nope. I do with deal with the reality. The bottom line is they fostered an environment that was violence and that was not something that brought people together. Instead of using the opportunity as president to bring people together and blur race and gender lines to get more about divisiveness.WILLIAMS: Oh I see, you want to blur race and gender when it makes you uncomfortable, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: I'm not uncomfortable by it at all.WILLIAMS: And it's like for people in this country will have to live --GUILFOYLE: I'm not uncomfortable by it at all. Why would I be uncomfortable with that as a Puerto Rico woman?GUTFELD: Blur race and gender is with alcohol.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Everybody just go out and get drunk.BOLLING: Thank you.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: That was a perfect way to get into this tease right here. Ahead, it's a story won't hear here on other news outlet today, murders are on the rise in more than two dozen U.S. cities, wait until you hear what the FBI Director James Comey thinks is to blame. Greg's take on that, coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: In over 20 major U.S. cities, homicides spiked in the first months of this year, causing the media to search for explanations while denying their own role in this body count. So far they blame heroin, gangs and economic factors. But one person isn't fleeing from the truth. FBI Director James Comey believes scrutiny aimed at police has changed the way it deals with citizens, creating a reticence that has increased homicides -- mainly among minorities. Odd that the media says minorities are often victims of the police, yet more die when the cops back off.So is this a coincidence? When you prevent the police from doing their jobs, murders go up? No, that's a scientific method, a consequence of an experiment. The experiment: hold back; the consequence: death.Now, liberals will bend over backwards to say they are troubled by this, but they will resist any common-sense answers. More petty crime, assaults and robberies occur when perps know the police aren't respected and crime becomes more tolerated. Witness the wild jump in shoplifting in California since a bill reduced penalties. Looting is now shopping.Fact is, reality implicates those scrambling for excuses: politicians, activists and media who undermine the men and women in blue. As gangs, occupied by immigrant and out-of-work young men, savage cities from Long Beach to Chicago, you might wonder: Where are the police? They're looking out for themselves. Someone has to.The numbers, Kimberly, are insane. Do you know that Long Beach has 125 percent increase. Arlington, Texas, 100 percent; El Paso, 100 percent; Mesa, 100 percent; Las Vegas, 81 percent. This is the first quarter of this year; it could change. Did anything happen -- does anything strike you, similarities?GUILFOYLE: Yes, I think it's -- this is really problematic. I mean, obviously, you know, gun violence, gang cases. I worked in Long Beach, and they had a tremendous problem with guns on the streets and gang violence. That was one of the cities that the L.A. D.A.'s office was in charge of.But I'll tell you what, when you see places like New York, when they are putting forward policies, legal policies and saying that they need to be banned here, it's not making the public or the citizens here more safe. It's actually making it unsafe for them, because they're not able to take the guns off the streets, OK, and they're making it too PC. The police are then, like, afraid to even do their jobs. They don't want to get sued. They don't want to get bad mouthed on TV.I mean, cops get killed in the line of duty. Does the president call them? Does he call their families? No, but he'll go ahead and say, ""Oh, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon Martin."" This is part of a culture that's going on right now that is really, really dangerous for public safety.GUTFELD: Juan, should I go to you now or show a clip from Sheriff Clarke?WILLIAMS: Go.GUTFELD: Yes. Sheriff Clarke has this to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: Cobs are not afraid to do their job. What they are afraid of, I've got a different effect. It's called the cop-hating United States Department of Justice, led by a race-obsessed attorney general.The president of the United States has been leading the chorus, slandering and maligning the character and the integrity of the service and the sacrifice for our nation's law enforcement officers.What officers fear is some witch hunt, this ongoing witch hunt by the Civil Rights Division, taking over law enforcement agencies all across the nation.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Now Juan, I know you disagree with most of it, but there is some truth to what he is saying, right? That cops feel there's a witch hunt.WILLIAMS: I don't know this. But I mean, I'll trust him. I trust him. I find he says very provocative things, but I don't know that it I've found him to be inaccurate.But I will say this, that I don't see that there's any evidence to support your monologue. Because I just read in the research that it says that there's been a decline.GUTFELD: In New York.WILLIAMS: New York and other cities.GUTFELD: But all these other -- there are at least 20 plus cities. I don't know how many top cities.WILLIAMS: So we've seen a spike in some cities. But it's not -- but if this phenomenon was, in fact...GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: ... proven, it would be every city. Because every city, from New York to Ferguson, has been touched by this business about the videoing.GUTFELD: New York has -- has a more, in my mind, sophisticated police department that is well-integrated and reflects the nature of the population a lot. Maybe that's the issue.WILLIAMS: That's an interesting point. I think New York City's police department is very integrated. But I think New York City has had the whole argument about stop and frisk, about Eric Garner being choked out in Staten Island. All that's here. But you've seen a decline.So I think something else is at work.Now, the arguments have to do with things like heroin. And we know there's more heroin around. It also has to do with drug trafficking. In the break you and I were talking about look at where these cities are.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: They're right on the Mexican border, for the most part. So I think there are other ways to look at it.But what's curious to me is that the FBI director, Jim Comey, who is just a man, I think, great integrity, says he thinks it is the fact that cops are being videotaped.But you even heard there, Sheriff Clarke say cops are doing their jobs. It's not asking you to do anything different. If you're videotaped, go right ahead. Videotape. Do your job.GUTFELD: Eric, thoughts?BOLLING: Yes. You know, right after Garner and right after the stop and frisk issue came up in New York, we all said that the incidents of crime was going to go up and, for the most part, it did.But the show of 25 percent decrease in the numbers the way some of these other cities, I'm of the mind -- I love Sheriff Clarke. I think he's so passionate. He believes in cops. I do, too. There's no one in the world who loves law enforcement than I do.GUILFOYLE: Me.BOLLING: I don't think -- I don't think it's fair to say that a cop is not going to do his job because of a videotape. I think a cop is on the job, he's going to stop the crime whether or not he's going to be videotaped or not.I just think this -- and again, I'm going to agree with this. I think the opiates is a massive problem. There's more and more opiates -- opiates and heroin coming from Mexico. It's an epidemic, and it's starting all along the border cities. It's going to work its way up. I think that's to blame.And again, I honestly think it's going to help everyone out, from the perp, from to the victims to the cops to the community. Get every cop fitted with a body cam. Get every cop fitted with a body cam and you can solve all these problems. Again, I'm not...I agree, James Comey is amazing. I just don't agree with this.WILLIAMS: I don't agree with it, either, because if someone is beating me in the head and someone tapes it, I think that's stop, cop. Don't do that.GUTFELD: OK. Well, Dana, I have -- another interesting element to this is Obama's focus. While we're seeing the violence go up in these cities, President Obama seems overly concerned with what's going on in bathrooms.PERINO: The transgender issue?GUTFELD: Yes, I mean, it's like there are people dying, and he -- he goes for the PC -- the thing that gets the most press.PERINO: I would say there's a real opportunity here for either of the candidates in the presidential election. And also, if you're one of the down-ballot candidates in any of those states, which is how are you going to help to try to turn this around? And that's why I mentioned the Crime Bill earlier.One of the reasons that the Crime Bill was passed in 1994 was to deal with crime states that were higher than that, but they were on the rise. And it worked. Now they want to reverse it back.I would say, if you are Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, you start getting your ducks in a row, and you figure out what you can say to convince communities that you would be somebody that would either try to help stop this or get the resources to the cops that they need.GUTFELD: All right. Donald Trump's hitting back at The New York Times for its expose on his past treatment of women. One of his former girlfriends featured in the piece is also speaking out. But you haven't seen her, yet. You'll hear from her, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Is the media engaged in a witch hunt against Donald Trump? Well, that's what the presumptive GOP nominee alleges after a string of negative stories in the press over the last few days, including a New York Times expose on his past behavior towards women. The piece features accounts from more than a dozen women who are former employees, girlfriends or associates of Trump.This includes Rowanne Brewer Lane, former model and girlfriend of the candidate. This morning on ""FOX and Friends,"" not only did she defend Trump. She accused the paper of getting her story wrong.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROWANNE BREWER LANE, FORMER GIRLFRIEND OF DONALD TRUMP: It was very upsetting. I was not happy to read it at all.They told me several times and my manager several times that it would not be a hit piece and that my story would come across the way that I was telling it and honestly. And it absolutely was not.They did take quotes from what I said, and they put a negative connotation and spun it to where it appeared negative. I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump.I don't know how many other girls feel like they were misquoted, but I know that for a fact I was. And I don't -- I don't want that out there. That's not it -- that's not how it was. That's not how it felt.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: So, that was big news this morning. It was an interview with Ainsley Earhardt on ""FOX and Friends."" And the authors of the article are standing by their column.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL BARBARO, REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: I interviewed Rowanne Brewer Lane. I'm going to let her speak for herself. But I think readers of the story can digest what happened to her at Mar-a-Lago in 1990.I think people can evaluate the story kind of on its own merits.MEGYN TWOHEY, REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: We gathered a variety of voices and, you know, our story is not just Rowanne's account of her experience with him, you know, in the 1990s. It's the experience of many women going back over the years.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Trump took to Twitter to voice his outrage, saying ""The New York Times is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie.""Greg, I see the intense eye contact.GUTFELD: I read this article, and the list of disgusting behavior by Trump is unbelievable. Did you know that he offered a woman a bikini, and then they later dated? It gets worse.GUILFOYLE: Awful stuff.GUTFELD: He made comments regarding a beauty pageant, I mean, about beauty at a beauty pageant. That's like -- that's like making comments about muscles at a body building contest. My God.Then he calls women ""dear."" I mean, this is absolutely outrageous. I mean, what a rigorous take-down The New York times did. It reminded me of the one they didn't do in 2007 about a candidate who actually had a fund- raiser with a terrorist. I ask everybody to do the Bill Ayers test and look at whatever is in that article. Does anything in that article come to even close, even close to meeting with Bill Ayers, a terrorist who tried to kill Americans?GUILFOYLE: No, it doesn't, dear.GUTFELD: Sorry, I lost my mind. But this is crazy.BOLLING: Does anything in that article come even close to what Bill Clinton did? I mean, now we know about this Lolita flight, right? FOX News piece that was out a couple of days ago said that Bill Clinton was on this flight.Jeffrey Epstein is a known pedophile. Right? He's been -- it's been proven. He would fly people around the country. There would be a bed on these airplanes. And there would be group sex going on.GUILFOYLE: Mile-high club.BOLLING: Bill Clinton took 26 flights on this airplane, sometimes ditching his Secret Service to go on this flight.Now, if the New York -- look, The New York Times is going to do what they're going to do. But if the Clintons want to use this war on women thing with Donald Trump, they'd better be careful. Because there is so much...GUILFOYLE: Material.BOLLING: ... material that Trump can use against Bill Clinton. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I think you're going to hear more about these flights, too, by the way.GUILFOYLE: Interesting. All right. So Dana, what do you make of this? The back and forth.PERINO: Back and forth. I'd like to say one thing that is different now for Donald Trump than it was for previous presidents, and it's to his advantage or to candidates.Remember when I think it was Newsweek that ran the photo of George H.W. Bush during his reelection and called him a wimp, ""The Wimp Factor."" And that really packed a punch. There was no way to really push back immediately. There was no way to have people on social media, Twitter or Facebook, whatever else to try to push back to get somebody out on cable television to do that.So I think Donald Trump uses that effectively.The other thing, I think, that he has said is somewhat, I think, defensible, is that he talked about past degradation of women in this way: ""I never anticipated running for public office or being a politician, so I'd have fun on the radio."" And he basically talks about being entertaining, and it wasn't necessarily meant to be degrading.GUILFOYLE: All right. So do you think ultimately, this is going to hurt the presumptive GOP nominee?WILLIAMS: No, in fact, I thought the New York Times piece fell flat for just the reasons you've heard before. I just didn't think it was compelling; ""Oh, this is egregious behavior.""I think the real issue here is one, Trump is still at about 70 percent disapproval with American women, including, I think, 50 percent with Republican, non-college-educated white women, which is his base.But the second thing to say is he's got a problem with the evangelicals, the social conservatives, three divorces, you know, the serial philander, I think, is what Cruz said about him. In addition to saying, you know, ""Planned Parenthood, I could support.""I think a lot of social conservatives have some trouble with those issues. So that's the issue. And I think that's why you're going to continue to see this issue of Trump's sexual attitudes and behaviors. Somebody said his New York values. This was Jeffers -- Tim Hokescamp (ph) of the Republican from Kansas. He just said Trump is a crass guy.GUILFOYLE: He's no Dennis Hastert.WILLIAMS: Ooh!GUILFOYLE: All right. Don't forget, we have Megyn Kelly's big sit-down with Donald Trump tomorrow night, and she's also going to join us here on ""The Five.""Next, it's an event-clearing brawl everyone is talking about today. A massive fight between the MLB's Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays. What set it all off when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: The Blue Jays and Rangers faced off for the final time of the regular season yesterday, and all hell broke loose at the top of the eighth.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bautista got the worse of that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Toronto outfielder Jose Bautista slid hard into second, right into Texas second baseman Rougned Odor, who was not happy and, as you saw, delivered a right hook to Bautista's jaw.Players from both teams rushed the field. Odor and Bautista, ejected. Tensions likely boiled over from the feud last season, when Bautista performed an infamous bat flip.The MLB is expected to hand out several fines and a few suspensions for yesterday's melee.Well, let me ask the old ball player. What do you think?BOLLING: Boys being boys. I love this.WILLIAMS: You love it?BOLLING: It was a hard slide into second. You're supposed to do that. That's what you're supposed to do.WILLIAMS: By the way, that's an illegal slide now.BOLLING: That was not an illegal slide. Get out of here, Juan. You think the second baseman...WILLIAMS: They changed the rule. They changed the rule.BOLLING: I have three cleat marks in my leg from a slide like that.WILLIAMS: I'm just saying they changed the rule.BOLLING: But you're right. That was a payback for the playoff game.I blame Obama for all this. You know why?WILLIAMS: Why's that?BOLLING: NAFTA.WILLIAMS: NAFTA?BOLLING: Canadians coming down and fighting Texans? I'm with the Texans.WILLIAMS: What do you say? You're a lawyer. Is that justice?GUILFOYLE: And a ballplayer. I mean, listen. Everybody knows you go in and your slide hard, and you drop the ball and you're safe. It happens all the time. Stealing home, that's the most fun.But obviously, not sportsman-like conduct, et cetera, et cetera, but everybody has been talking about this and watching it today. And my God, I can't believe that guy is going to be able to stand up after getting clocked like that. He took quite a punch.WILLIAMS: Dana, you know, the fact is that last season, when you flip the bat like that, you embarrass the other pitcher. And it was -- some bitterness.PERINO: I'll tell you, I totally would have stayed in the dugout. I wouldn't have gone to the field.WILLIAMS: Gregory, you're smirking.GUTFELD: Why can't we just live in peace?WILLIAMS: In peace?GUTFELD: Why can't we just live in peace? Why do we even need sports? This is this idea of keeping score and everybody getting angry. Why can't they just meet on the field and just discuss their problem?WILLIAMS: What about WWE? We could have done that. It's so much more friendly. Sex and violence.GUILFOYLE: Safe spaces.WILLIAMS: ""One More Thing"" up next.BOLLING: I was thinking, playoffs...(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing"" -- K.G.GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, I'd like to honor an extraordinary American who recently passed away. Seventy-year-old Pat Rogers was described by my good friend Bill Spence (ph) as the closest thing to Captain America, Supercop and James Bond combined. He was a war hero in Vietnam and served in the NYPD, receiving one of NYPD's highest honors, the Medal of Valor. He trained and mentored thousands of the members of the armed forces, police department and the private sector throughout the country. He is survived by his loving wife Ellen and his brother Tim. Pat brought people together, and he will be dearly missed.PERINO: Great man. Thanks for sharing, K.G.Eric, you're next.BOLLING: All right. Along those lines, today President Obama stood with law enforcement. It was an amazing scene. Take a look at this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Public safety officers we recognize today with the Medal of Valor found courage, not in search of recognition. They did it instinctively.Our nation has a responsibility to support those who serve and protect us and keep our streets safe.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: It was a fantastic ceremony. And if you didn't well up during that ceremony, you have no emotion at all. A sight to be seen.GUILFOYLE: Yes. I loved it. Wonderful.PERINO: Greg.GUTFELD: It's time for something very important.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: Greg's Fashion News(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh. Wow.GUTFELD: You know, in the fashion world, there are some eternal facts that you must remember. One, never make fashion suggestions while you're on camera and don't wear sequins when you're doing the weather.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ... into tomorrow. What's going on? You want me to put this on? Why, because it's cold?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're getting a lot of e-mails.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There you go.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Really? OK. I look like a librarian now.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: The big problem here is librarians happen to look very attractive, and I think that was meant to be an insult to librarians. And I won't stand for that. Inappropriate all around.PERINO: I thought she looked fine.GUTFELD: Everything is inappropriate. Everything is inappropriate.PERINO: OK.GUILFOYLE: OK, Zoolander.PERINO: I have a few pictures from a fun night that I had on Saturday. We got to go to the debut of -- I think it was the second night of somewhere on a beach tour with Dierks Bentley. And my friend Macy English, there she is. She was ""One More Thing"" worthy. We talked about that all weekend. Got to do all sorts of things backstage. And we also...GUTFELD: What?PERINO: Come on, Greg. We got to meet this young woman named Cam, Cam Country -- there she is right there. Check her out. She sings ""Burning House,"" ""May Day,"" lots of other great songs, and she was one of the opening acts.GUILFOYLE: Awesome, like Camden, New Jersey.GUTFELD: Nice.GUILFOYLE: Dana had on ripped jeans.PERINO: I did, I did. Juan, you are next.WILLIAMS: All right. So on Saturday morning, at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., my 27-year-old son Raffi was confirmed as a follower of Christ. It was a wonderful moment for the family to see Raffi embrace a life of faith. Here he is coming in. And, you know, he's with other people from our church, Trinity Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C.GUILFOYLE: Nice.WILLIAMS: Behind him, you see Father John Harmon. There's Father Harmon and Father Simmons, who are in our parish. And there you see him with his mom and dad and Father Harmon. And one more. And here he is with the bishop of West Virginia, who performed the confirmation.It was a wonderful moment. Everybody putting their hands on Raffi's shoulder as he was being confirmed.PERINO: That gave me goose bumps. Very nice.BOLLING: You got a bishop to do it.WILLIAMS: It was pretty cool.PERINO: Wow. Congratulations to all of you. You always have great pictures on Monday.Tomorrow night, Megyn Kelly joins us to preview her big one-on-one with Donald Trump. So don't miss it.

This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" October 4, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, the first, and only, vice presidential debate is now in the books and while both campaigns are saying, their guy scored the most points, a lot of debate watchers are expressing frustration with what at times became a free-for-all.Welcome to a special live 11:00 p.m. edition of ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly. Thanks for staying up late. Reporting tonight from Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, the two candidates left the stage about 20 minutes ago, they covered a lot of ground tonight. And spent a lot of time talking about the top of the tickets. From insults, to the economy, foreign policy and policing, there was very little left behind. And here is some of that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TIM KAINE, D-VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death.  MIKE PENCE, R-VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult driven campaign.  KAINE: Under Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against Bin laden and wiped him off the face of the earth. And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000.PENCE: Right. And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS.  KAINE: If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans everything that he talks about.  PENCE: If Donald Trump has said all of the things that you said, he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables. Senator, please. You know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making accusations of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.  KAINE: Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement.  PENCE: I think the fact that under this past administration, of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we almost doubled the national debt is atrocious. In the wake of a season where American families are struggling into this economy under the weight of higher taxes and ObamaCare and the war on calling this stifling avalanche or regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.KAINE: The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because Bin Laden is dead. The terrorist threat is decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapon program has been stopped. The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000, in the dangerous parts of the world, there's only 15,000 but there are other parts of the world that are challenging.PENCE: After traveling millions of miles as our Secretary of State, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States. It's absolutely inarguable.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: We have a big show lined up for you tonight. Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway is here, so is Hillary Clinton's National Press Secretary Brian Fallon. We'll also get Charles Krauthammer's key takeaways and so much more.But we begin the night with Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor and Howie Kurtz, host of ""MediaBuzz"" on Fox News. Great to see you both. Chris, your thoughts.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: No hits, no runs, no errors. They did their job which was to not make news. I think Pence set a better night. Kaine was interruptee over modulated too hot coming in, couldn't quite settle down. But look, they were here to not harm the ticket. And they did their jobs and they can walk --  KELLY: Before we get to Howie on the interruptee --STIREWALT: Interruptee.KELLY: Here is a flavor of that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAINE: You both have said Vladimir Putin --ELAINE QUIJANO, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: We're going to get to Russia in just a moment.PENCE: He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country.KAINE: And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.(CROSSTALK)PENCE: Senator, I think I'm still on my time.KAINE: Well, I think -- isn't this a discussion?QUIJANO: This is our open discussion.KAINE: Yes, let's talk about the state of --PENCE: Well, let me interrupt -- let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can. Have run this economy into a ditch. We're in the --KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs?PENCE: -- slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs?QUIJANO: Governor --  (CROSSTALK) Gentlemen, the people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other. I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished.PENCE: I was in Washington, D.C. on 9/11. I saw the clouds, the smoke rise from the Pentagon.  KAINE: I was in Virginia where the Pentagon's --PENCE: I know you were. We all lived through that day as a nation.QUIJANO: Gentlemen, please.  KAINE: Because the FBI did an investigation.QUIJANO: Gentlemen.KAINE: And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further. Sorry.QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Unbelievable. I mean, Tim Kaine even interrupted Mike Pence when he was just trying to share a remembrance about 9/11.  STIREWALT: Yes.KELLY: He had to get in where he was.STIREWALT: And it's one of those things where you can tell Kaine had all of these lines that he wanted to get in, it was like oh, I'll say that and I'll say this and I'll say the other thing, and that look, and it was just too much when he couldn't quite handle it.  KELLY: And there were questions online about, where was the moderator?  Where was the control?HOWIE KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": I got to tell you, Megyn. I loved politics but this debate made my head hurt. Unfortunately, Elaine Quijano the moderator from CBS let this careen utterly out of control. Tim Kaine interrupting Mike Pence far more often without much admonition from the moderator. But here's the thing as Chris was just saying. I mean, Tim Kaine was so determined to throw out as many grenades against Donald Trump as he could even if they exploded around his body.KELLY: Uh-hm.KURTZ: That in another reference to 9/11, he somehow turned it around to Donald Trump and didn't pay his taxes and Mexican rapists and he kept bringing these things up again and again. Mike Pence was a former radio talk show host, tried not to take the bait on every attack against Trump.  KELLY: He took no bait. Really.  KURTZ: Yes.STIREWALT: Right.KURTZ: Which -- about the accusations about not defending his guy. But he came across a little more modulated and a little more dignified. I think as time went on, Kaine lost this debate because his attacks were less forceful as they became so scatter shocked.KELLY: What do you make of the lottery theory that Kaine lost, he didn't care whether he won or lost, he just wanted to mention --STIREWALT: Yes. Say the words, say the words.KELLY: -- taxes, many times as humanly possible.STIREWALT: Right. Right. Get there and say the words. Look, these are two very traditional, very normal, very mainstream candidates who are running on a ticket with people who are not normal candidates. These are people who are --KELLY: Abnormal.  STIREWALT: Right. Well, for good or for ill.  (CROSSTALK)But their job is to show normalcy and they did that and Kaine and Pence both did this. They both steered around the fundamental questions and issues for their candidates. There is a lot of non-answering that was going on tonight. You sort of expect that. But I think they both ably dodged.  KELLY: Yes. They did. They were able to dodge.STIREWALT: Able dodge.KELLY: Great to see you both.STIREWALT: You bet.KELLY: Well, as Donald Trump watched this debate, he lied tweeted his reaction to what we saw on stage, and we have Trump's -- stakes for you tonight.Joining me now from just outside the debate hall, our chief political correspondent Carl Cameron. Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Megyn. Well, Trump tweeted 44 times including re-tweets in that 90 minutes debate which means basically, at least once every two minutes and among them, there were some pretty good doozies. They go something like this. ""Wow, Kaine couldn't go 12 seconds without a lie. Marines are scared of the liar running."" He re-tweeted, ""Kaine looks like an evil crook out of Batman movies.""Then there was, ""Kaine says Hillary and he have plans, she could care less what Kaine thinks."" ""Loving Mike Pence. He's so likable and sensible.  Kaine is just talking bull."" ""Hillary Clinton sneers at millions of average Americans."" ""Clinton's close ties to Putin deserve scrutiny.""  Then there is, ""Kaine is awful. Trump and Pence are the ticket. No more lies. We're ready to see America great again.""And he ultimately ended it up congratulating Mike Pence for what he said was a victory and at one point, he actually criticized the moderator.  Something that we're likely to hear a lot of in the next couple of days -- Megyn.KELLY: Carl, good to see you.CAMERON: You bet.KELLY: Well, political analyst suggesting that Senator Kaine's main objective tonight would be to turn Governor Mike Pence into Donald Trump and force Mr. Pence to answer for all of Trump's controversies. Fulfilling those reports, Senator Kaine did not hold back using several opportunities to bring up a laundry list of Trump's controversies. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAINE: Donald Trump during his campaigns has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. And I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother. He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW and said he wasn't a hero he'd been captured.He said, African-Americans are living in hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen. If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans everything that he talks about.  And I just -- again I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult driven campaign that Donald Trump has run.PENCE: He says, our is an insult driven campaign? Did you all just hear that? Ours is an insult driven campaign? I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you said he said in the way you said he said them, he still would not have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables.  KAINE: Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail and the very next day she said, you know what? I shouldn't have said that. You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing.  KELLY: Joining me now, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne, great to see you.KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Hi, Megyn.  KELLY: So, what do you make of that exchange where Kaine's response was, she took responsibility for what she said and apologized?  CONWAY: No. She didn't.KELLY: And suggesting Trump never has apologized to anybody for anything.CONWAY: No, she didn't. And that is not fair. Let me break it down first way. First of all -- because she got caught on tape at a fund-raiser with her donors, which is how she usually sent her time insulting tens of millions of Americans calling them a basket of deplorables and irredeemable at that. You add to that the Bernie Sanders voters since we since heard again in fundraisers or donors' where she insulted them as basement dwellers --KELLY: She didn't say that. She said they're in basements struggling to make something out of their lives. She didn't say basement dwellers.CONWAY: It didn't sound very nice, it didn't sound very complimentary.  And even Bernie Sander said, he had a hard time listening to that. But the fact is that --KELLY: He defended her on that.  CONWAY: In part. And then he said he had a hard time hearing that. And look, Megyn, very simple. American people know that she has insulted people. That she has disdain for lots of Americans. And I'd like the fact that Mike Pence brought it up, because the reason he used the word fraction was very clear that Tim Kaine wants to talk about this comment or that comment by Donald Trump and yet, you have a woman running for president of the United States who has expressed this scene for lots of Americans.And that's why he used the word fraction. The other thing that was happening there is Tim Kaine was never answering the question, he came ready to have spill out of his mouth this unending flow of sound bites and canned responses. They came up terrible. There he was, interrupting a female moderator. We lost track of the time. We just thought --KELLY: We can interrupt the female moderator saying --CONWAY: Well, no, it's the Clinton campaign who loves to throw around words like sexism and unhinged. They've got to be regretting those words on a night like tonight when Tim Kaine --  KELLY: What about -- they got into a long discussion about Putin and what Trump has said about Putin and what he hasn't said and we have that exchange keyed up. And then, we have a bit of a fact check. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAINE: Donald Trump again and again has praised Vladimir Putin and it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin.  PENCE: Let me be very clear on this Russian thing. The larger question here --KAINE: Do you think Donald Trump has smart to not pay taxes?  QUIJANO: Gentlemen, we're going to have time to get to Russia here.PENCE: What we're dealing with is the -- you know, there's an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates. And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Things you've said about Vladimir Putin. You said, I will tell you in terms of leadership, he's getting an A, our president is not doing so well. And when referring to a comment, that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said it's always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond.  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating. I have already said, he is very much of a leader. I mean, you can say, oh, isn't that a terrible thing? The man has very strong control over a country.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: So, Trump, he did say that Putin was a leader and compared him unfavorably to President Obama and even Mike Pence actually came out and said, it's inarguable that Putin is a stronger leader than Obama.CONWAY: Meaning in their respective countries. Yes, I'm sorry --  KELLY: What do you mean? Putin is a strong leader. Do you believe that?  Does Donald Trump believe he is a strong leader? That the people follow him because they feel inspired?CONWAY: And Obama is here and you just heard Mike Pence use the words feckless leadership. There is no question that we respect the less around the world. There is no question that if Donald Trump and Mike Pence are president and vice president, that the American exceptionalism, the teamster strength and America first.  KELLY: But Kellyanne, you understand what this argument goes. Putin had journalists shot in the streets. So it's a little jarring for people to hear him praised by Donald Trump as a strong leader, stronger than President Obama.CONWAY: He is stronger there than he is here and he also said, he played the full Clinton -- he also says in the commander-in-chief forum, different forum, that he says that I don't necessarily agree with that system of government. This is what Donald Trump said. He's a strong leader there than Obama is here. Nobody thinks Obama is a strong leader. I mean, if Obama is a strong leader, Secretary of State would have 55 percent --  (CROSSTALK)Why in the new CNN poll is Hillary Clinton at 53 percent among women? She is running as the first female president. There is something holding her back.KELLY: She is beating Donald Trump by 20 points with women. I mean, why is Donald Trump at 32 percent?CONWAY: Not really. Not in our polls.KELLY: Kellyanne --CONWAY: She's got a gender gap of her own.  KELLY: She does. She does. She has a huge gap. No question about that.  But you're sitting here suggesting why are her numbers low with women? And you work for Donald Trump. His numbers are historically low for a Republican nominee with women. Historically low.CONWAY: Mitt Romney lost by 11 points and John McCain lost --  KELLY: Mitt Romney's numbers are crushing Donald Trump's numbers with women.  CONWAY: It's not Election Day yet. Why are we winning Ohio and Iowa --KELLY: It's 35 days to go, Kellyanne. I mean, the criticism of Donald Trump is that he couldn't win this race and that he was doing -- and he was rebounding and his numbers in various states are rebounding, and then, he went after Miss Universe and talked about her being too fat and talked about women's looks again. And women don't like that according to these polls.  CONWAY: I guess I would throw this on why we're here, which is the vice presidential debate. I thought Mike Pence did a --  KELLY: Which all about who should be elected president.  CONWAY: Well, but Megyn, in fairness to Donald Trump, his very first execution of leadership and judgment was brought after he became the nominee. Selection of Governor Mike Pence as his running mate. And America saw tonight how wonderful that selection is. Because this man, as governor of Indiana has cut taxes for employees and individuals, the unemployment rate was slashed in half.He's expanded school choice and charters. He's brought manufacturing jobs back. I worked with Mike Pence for probably ten years. The guy will make a fabulous vice president. And you juxtaposed him against Tim Kaine tonight. He basically spent most of his career in government service, is no stranger to the debate stage. And you think that Tim Kaine's performance tonight is going to sit well with women?(CROSSTALK)Yes. I think what you're going to hear from all the pundits tonight, this vice presidential debates don't really matter. They won't move the polls because they know how lopsided the victory was for Mike Pence.KELLY: I got to go because I got a Clinton campaign representative coming up. We're going to talk about that. Great to see you.  CONWAY: Thank you.  KELLY: Thanks for being here. So for his part, Governor Mike Pence made the case against Hillary Clinton in a way that some critics wanted Donald Trump to do during last week's presidential debate. Here was one exchange getting a lot of attention.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control. At a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled American's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults.  The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was Secretary of State.  KAINE: Okay. Now, I can weigh -- I get to weigh in.  PENCE: She had a private server --  KAINE: Now, I get to weigh in. Now, let me just say this --PENCE: -- that was discovered --(CROSSTALK)QUIJANO: Senator, please, you have an opportunity to respond. KAINE: Governor Pence doesn't think the world is going so well. And, you know, he's going to say it to everybody.  PENCE: Do you?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Brian Fallon is the national press secretary for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, he is with me now. Great to see you.  BRIAN FALLON, CLINTON CAMPAIGN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Thanks for having me.  KELLY: So, what do you make of that because you heard Kellyanne make the point, it was my question to Lanny Davis, whether these women that both campaigns are fighting for, right, could make the difference in this election, are going to like how interruptee, to quote, Stirewalt's word, he was. I mean, constantly, constantly interrupting, interrupting.FALLON: Well, the running mate has two jobs in a debate like this. Number one is, to defend your candidate, the person at the top of the ticket. I thought Tim Kaine was hugely effective in defending Hillary Clinton when he came under false attack from Mike Pence helping make the affirmative case about what Clinton-Kaine administration would do on the economy. And then secondly, you need to make the case against the other person on the other side of the ballot.And I thought that he was extremely effective in making the case about why Donald Trump is temper mentally unfit to be president. And the reason he was so effective was he was citing Trump's own words and what was the most notable I thought was that Mike Pence was sort of not engaging at those points. Whether --KELLY: Was that -- and let me get to Pence -- was that a strategy to have him -- it doesn't matter how many times he interrupts just keeps saying, this -- messages or launching these attacks over and over again?FALLON: Well, look, it's easy to seem agreeable if you're not making any case on behalf of your candidate. Mike Pence, I thought sort of sat out major portions of the debate where Tim Kaine was calling out statements that Donald Trump has made. And I thought that was perfectly reasonable and I thought that what was notable was that Mike Pence didn't seem interested in defending some of Donald Trump's more outrageous comments.  It seemed like he made a conclusion coming into tonight that if he didn't want to have to defend the Independents --  KELLY: He did make a reference at one point to the fact that he is not a professional politician, he hasn't lived the past, you know, several decades running for office and watching everything he says.  FALLON: Well, look, just take an issue like Russia. I mean, Donald Trump has gone around in the course of this campaign, expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin, he is essentially endorsed a wish list of pro-Putin policies, he suggested we should withdraw from NATO which would put our European ally at risk. And tonight we heard a completely different message from Mike Pence, he was talking about how Putin is a bully and he was small.I mean, at the next debate, I hope that Donald Trump will be asked if he agreed to what Mike Pence said. And I think that that showed that Mike Pence had his own agenda tonight. And to me, it almost meant that he was auditioning for 2020 more than he cared about electing Donald Trump in 2016.  KELLY: What about Hillary Clinton's point tonight suggesting that she and President Obama have stopped Iran's nuclear program. I mean, no one thinks that stopped, at best, it's been curbed at absolute best, but it hasn't been shut down.  FALLON: Look, there is no question as a result of the deal that was struck by the Obama administration last year that we have suspended and put on hold the complete ambitions of the Iran regime to acquire nuclear weapons.  The status quo is not going to be tenable. And I think we're --KELLY: The capability is not gone. It hasn't been stopped. It's been curbed but it's still an operation. You know that.  FALLON: We are on much safer footing today.KELLY: But that is a different statement. That is a different statement.  What he said tonight is factually wrong.  FALLON: I don't think that is true at all.  KELLY: You believe the Iranian nuclear program has stopped? That is her position and your position?FALLON: Yes.  KELLY: It stopped. It's over.FALLON: Well --KELLY: Congratulations.  FALLON: Let's be clear. We're not suggesting the Iranians do not continue to harbor ambitions to pursue nuclear weapons but their capability to pursue that nuclear program is completely off now. And that is why Hillary Clinton has said you need to take a distrust for verify approached, she doesn't suddenly believe Iran is an ally of any kind. They're continuing to fund terrorism in the region, they are continuing to sow instability all across the Middle East. And so yes, absolutely, they still have a mind to pursue nuclear weapons but they're not going to be able to do so under this agreement.  KELLY: Let's pick up in the last point that I was discussing to Kellyanne which is the women. Right? And there is a gender gap and that is true.  Trump is definitely struggling with women. But Hillary Clinton is struggling worse with men. The gender gap is worse on her in getting men.  And you tell me what she's going to do if anything between now and November 8th to reach out to them.  FALLON: Well, we always are seeking to reach out to voters that are not currently supporting Hillary Clinton and we're going to continue to do that. But if you look at some of the national polls that came out just yesterday, she's making complete inroads but male voters and I think that the gap is so much more pronounced among women voters that it's a point where Donald Trump can't recover if those numbers stay the same in terms of that gender gap.And so it's Donald Trump that has more repair work to do with women voters, that is why Hillary Clinton was today in Delaware County in Pennsylvania making the case to women. A lot of them probably Mitt Romney voters in 2012. I mean, she was like pay equity, paid family leave, child care.  With her daughter there, with Elizabeth Banks there. I think that is extremely powerful and that gender gap is going to be irrecoverable for Donald Trump. And unfortunately, tonight there is nothing that Mike Pence could say that would change that dynamic for Donald Trump.  KELLY: Okay. So you see no game changer this evening?FALLON: It's impossible for the numbers to change the dynamic. The problem is the guy at the top, Donald Trump.  KELLY: Great to see you, Brian.  FALLON: Thanks.  KELLY: Thanks for being here.Well, there is a lot more just ahead including from Charles Krauthammer who says, there is one clear loser in tonight's debate. And you might be surprised who that is.Plus, David Wohl and Mo Elleithee are next on who came out ahead in a powerful exchange over policing and race.And then, Marc Thiessen and Austan Goolsbee weigh in and what happened when this debate went nuclear. Don't miss this.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAINE: Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s. He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event. And I think that is who Governor Pence's running-mate is. Exactly who President warned us about.PENCE: Senator. Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton and that, that is pretty low.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: I mean, Hillary Clinton Senator Kaine and God bless you for it.  Career public servants, that's great - Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business. Those tax return that came out publicly this week show that he's facing pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the ""New York Times,"" not too long ago, he is what's called net operating loss. We have a tax code Senator that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship.KAINE: But why won't he release his tax return?PENCE: We're answering the question about the business thing.  KAINE: I do want to --PENCE: His tax returns showed going through a very difficult time. But he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used and he did it brilliantly.  KAINE: He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said you haven't been paying taxes, he said ""that makes me smart."" So, it's smart not to pay for our military, not to pay for our veterans, it's smart not to pay for teachers and I guess all of us who do pay for those things I guess we're stupid.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: As you just heard, Donald Trump's tax returns became a heated point of contention between Mike Pence and Tim Kaine tonight. And it's an issue that we could hear more off as we look ahead to the second presidential debate on Sunday, five days away.Joining me now, Dr. Charles Krauthammer, syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor. Charles, great to see you. So, first, let's just start with -- your overall thoughts on how the debate went.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, unfortunately, the big loser was the moderator. I don't envy her position but she lost control of the debate very early. The candidates were talking over each other and this is a pet to peeve I have with all moderators not just then one.  Although it was worse in this one. You know, towards the end you're getting really good exchanges of the time where they were going at each other, quite revealing. And she would say, we have to stop and go on to another subject.To which I would say, why, who cares about hitting all the points. At one point, I was watching some other folks who burst out laughing when she said, yes, but we're going to talk about North Korea. Well, that is less interesting than talking about their -- the top of the ticket. Look. I thought in the end, it obviously didn't move the needle. Because they were each trying to do something completely different. And to some extent, succeeded. Kaine was trying to spread little nuclear. Well, I wouldn't call them nuclear, conventional explosives all over the place by mentioning all of the misstatements, outrageous statements that Trump had said and it's clear that Pence had made a decision not to go down the rabbit hole on every one of these because otherwise, you never were to talk about anything else.But it did make him look defensive and I didn't do a content analysis. But I would guess that most of the time it was spent defending or at least with the Pence, Trump team on the defense. What Kaine tried to do was simply to say, this guy is unreliable, this guy has wrong temperament but Pence's strategy, and I thought he won on tone, it was always calm and collected, it was a kind of Reagan saying to Carter, there you go again. Was to simply say, well, perhaps, my guy has made misstatements but your candidate and her people have been in charge for eight years and in a larger sense, for 30 years and look where we are.Look at the state of the world. And that is what he concentrated on. What he has said, that is what Kaine was talking about. But what Pence talked about is what she had done, and not done. And I thought on that, the new rating for example, the failures with Russia, he did very well.KELLY: What do you make of the notion that Trump could be his -- the question is about his temperament, can be answered or at least assuaged by this calm, cool, collected running mate?   KRAUTHAMMER: I think to some extent if you've got a very hot candidate, what you want is a cool number two. You want something to say well, if there is, you know, for example if Trump had chosen Newt Gingrich, I think he said they were both pirates and you don't want a two-pirate ticket. You want one guy to be the pirate and another guy to be the justice or the peace and perhaps even a minister. And to some extent, Pence presented himself sort of like a minister, reasonable, very serious answer. I thought at the very end at the question of religion. So, I think that helps the ticket to whatever extent the vice president can. Unfortunately, he or she usually doesn't.KELLY: What did you make of the fact that Trump was tweeting during the debate calling Tim Kaine names?KRAUTHAMMER: What it means that the Trump campaign has not succeeded in taking away his cell phone and that remains like job number one for Kellyanne and the rest of the gang. It was harmless at least the ones you showed on the screen, but he has shown in the last week that he can tweet in a way that can be very harmful to him and I don't think he ought to be allowed near one.KELLY: You know, I think he's following the old I got to be me and...KRAUTHAMMER: Well that's -- that's going to earn me at least one choice tweet from Donald. I suspect.KELLY: I think I've received mine tonight. He was just letting me know that Kellyanne was here in the audience and he was out in Nevada and nobody was watching his phones and that became apparent soon thereafter. Charles, great to see you.KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure.KELLY: Well, there was a long back and forth tonight when the moderator asked how both campaigns have addressed the issue of race and policing. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAINE: The way you make community safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing.Donald Trump said we need to do more stop and frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.PENCE: Community policing is a great idea. To use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of implicit bias or institutional racist, I mean, and that really has got to stop. We are to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action. But Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.KAINE: Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement. And if you're afraid to have...PENCE: I'm not afraid to bring that up.KAINE: If you're afraid to have the discussion, you'll never solve it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Fascinating. Joining me now, attorney and Trump supporter David Wohl and former Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee. Great to see you both.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Megyn.KELLY: That was extraordinary, wasn't it? I mean you don't hear the arguments that articulately bounce back and forth that often in today's debate which tends to descend into ugly places when you go on, I mean, to race in general, race and the police as well. David your thoughts.DAVID WOHL, TRIAL ATTORNEY: Well, Tim Kaine basically said no stops, no frisks and if we get skyrocketing murder rates, oh, well, because I don't want to offend those people. I thought there was a tremendous counter punch by pence in that regard. What he said was, you known what, those people you're talking about offending, those are the victims of the people who aren't stopped, aren't frisked and carry guns and carry knives that end up killing people in the inner city.So, you balance it, I mean, are you talking about worrying about offending people and not so much worrying about them dying at the hands of people who aren't stopped and frisked. And Rudy Giuliani proved it Megyn, and reality is that stop and frisk works. If you're not carrying weapons you can go on your merry way. If you are carrying something and you're found in possession you're arrested.KELLY: But what about the messaging, Mo, as a political matter or what about the messaging to the cops, right, in particular because you've got African-Americans for whom this is a very big issue, and then you've got cops for whom this is a very big issue, and then the rest of society who watches it and is interested in it but it can't possibly be as powerful to them as those who are directly affected by these policies.MO ELLEITHEE, FORMER DNC SPOKESMAN: Yeah, I think from just a purely political perspective, we can argue the substance. But just or purely political perspective, there are really two things at play here. One is Donald Trump keeps saying he wants to do more outreach to the African- American community. This is a nonstarter in the African-American community.Stop and frisk is one of the least popular policies in the African-American community. And the second point is I think the Kaine message in that exchange was very telling because it basically said we are safer when there is more trust between the two sides.KELLY: ...policing when they work together.ELLEITHEE: Right, when they actually work together. Stop and frisk is one of the most divisive tools in recent history. And so, if we're going to actually find a way to eradicate this violence, we're going to have to bring the police and the community together, this is not the way to do it.WOHL: Murder rates in Chicago skyrocketing, 3,000 (inaudible) this year means absolutely out of control and the reality is everything that its tried has failed. So, the reality is yes, community policing, get together with people saying look, we're going to go up to suspicious people on the streets and we're going to stop and frisk them. If they've got nothing, we're going to apologize about it...ELLEITHEE: In New York...WOHL: ...and you got to do something. They're getting killed in record numbers.ELLEITHEE: In New York, the murder rate has gone down since stop and frisk has ended. And that shows that this notion of stop...WOHL: That's just not true, 2014-2015, it's gone up.ELLEITHEE: No, it's absolutely true. The list (ph) has gone down.WOHL: Basically it's gone up.KELLY: I think the sheer numbers show a slight rise in the murder rate but the numbers are not huge from '14 to '15 if memory serves. I'll have to fact check myself on that. But there's no different ways of looking at it because you can look at violent crime, you can look at murders. It's a lovely exercise if you want to walk down that lane.But you tell me whether -- because Mike Pence, he sounded very thoughtful about it and he sounded defensive of police which -- is that typically a democratic voting block? I mean the police, they tend to be working class. I mean the unions and so on. Do they tend to vote democratic and do you think in an election like this they'll do so?ELLEITHEE: You know, I think historically, right, historically there are some issues that you -- whoever has the D next to their name gets sort of an automatic, you know, advantage and whoever has the R next to their name gets an automatic advantage.KELLY: With cops.ELLEITHEE: I think law enforcement traditionally has been something that Republicans have sort of started off with an advantage on. I don't know if that's the case now. To be honest, I'm not sure either side really has much of an advantage right now. I think, you know, a whole notion of safety and public safety and law enforcement and crime, right now both sides, there is so much distrust on both sides. I don't know that there is a political advantage to be had other than to try to say I'm going to keep you safe by bringing a community together.WOHL: Not so powerful voting block, Megyn. What's happened in Dallas? White cops murdered in New Orleans, two cops murdered. That is very powerful evidence on the Republican side to say look, we need to support them. There are some bad cops every once in a while, but overall -- and Pence had this right -- overall they want to do good, they want to help. And they've got to be able to...KELLY: Before we go, you know, Tim Kaine got some guts (ph) tonight for interrupting too many people. And I have to ask you, Mo, whether he interrupted this critical moment that you shared with him years ago. Watch. You tell me whether he was interrupting you or whether he just let this play as it should have as you married your beautiful bride.ELLEITHEE: He did a great job that night. We're still together. So at least whether or not you agree with him politically, you know he does this well.KELLY: You were in the middle of like, all the days of my -- and lo to you!ELLEITHEE: No. No. No interrupting. There was no speak now or forever hold your piece.WOHL: And that was beautiful. Congratulations. Beautiful bride.KELLY: Congratulations. That was very lovely.ELLEITHEE: Thank you. I'm a lucky man.KELLY: Great to see you guys.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you though.KELLY: Well, there were also some fierce exchanges tonight on the Iranian nuclear program, on terrorism, and on our domestic security. Nobody did this except for me. Let's start with that last point. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian Refugee Program by 500...ELAINE QUIJANO, DEBATE MODERATOR: Governor, the question wasn't that home grown.PENCE: But first, you know, let's make sure we're putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian...KAINE: Or instead of you violating the constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they're dangerous.PENCE: It's not. That's absolutely false.KAINE: Hillary and I will immigration enforcement and will vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not. We won't do it based discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion.PENCE: But the problem with that is we...KAINE: That is completely antithetical like a Jeffersonian values...PENCE: Look, the director of the FBI or Homeland Security said we can't know for certain who these people are coming are from Syria.KAINE: So, if you don't let them know, we don't let them in.(CROSSTALK)KAINE: And we don't know who they are, we don't let them in.PENCE: If the FBI and Homeland Security said we can't know for certain. You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, senator.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining us now, two former White House insiders, Marc Thiessen, who's an American Enterprise Institute scholar and a Fox News contributor who served during the Bush administration and Austan Goolsbee who's an economics professor at the University Of Chicago Booth School Of Business, previously served as President Obama's former chief economist. Marc what did you think?MARC THIESSEN, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: So, I mean, what he said about Iran was completely and totally untrue. There were tons of foreign policy whoppers in this debate. But number one, Hillary Clinton didn't negotiate the deal, John Kerry did. And number two, it didn't eliminate the Iran's nuclear weapons program, it legalized it.KELLY: Over and over. I just had this debate with Brian Fallon where I was just pressing him in the fact that she's claiming it's stopped, that the program had been stopped. It's been eliminated, and that's just not the case.THIESSEN: Well, it's not the case at all.KELLY: Here is the sound, let's just play it so they know what we're talking about.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAINE: She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.PENCE: Eliminate the Iranian nuclear program?KAINE: Absolutely. And without firing a shot, he doesn't want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: It's been eliminated and stopped.THIESSEN: Except it hasn't. It's been legalized. It hasn't been eliminated. What the deal did was it reduced their nuclear stockpile of materials and lengthened their break out time for one they could have deal. But in expires in 15 years and in the meantime, Iran gets to keep its entire nuclear infrastructure. They get to continue developing ballistic missile.They had four ballistic missile test since the deal was signed, so they get to develop the missile to one day deliver the nuclear weapons. And oh, by the way, we gave him a $150 billion with which to fund all of these. So far from eliminating Iran's nuclear program, that should make it more likely 15 years from now, there are going to be a nuclear weapons...KELLY: Let's stop there and got to Austan on that. Austan, why is what Marc just said not correct?AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: That's not correct at all. Look, as you might imagine, the negotiation and the treaty is far more complex than just a one dimensional thing. You can develop nuclear weapons on multiple tracks there, uranium bombs and plutonium bombs. The plutonium -- the entire highway was shut down. They filled with plutonium devices and developments with concrete.The international inspectors have said there is no way that the plutonium channel is completely shut. Uranium channel, which, I might add, they had 5,000 centrifuges for during the Bush administration has been stalled and put off for at least 15 years. So, if you're going to say OK, they have the centrifuges and 15 years from now they can come back and try to re-ignite them, fine.We can have that debate, but to make the argument that somehow, this treaty enabled their nuclear weapons program when their nuclear weapons program started and got to 5,000 centrifuges under the old regime is just totally misleading.KELLY: I don't know what it's about whether it enabled it. But it's a fact check on whether eliminated was correct because he said 3 or 4 times. Go ahead Marc.THIESSEN: Oh, he did. And also, I mean, the truth is that they continue to keep their nuclear stockpile and they have in fact, we just found out that they had a secret deal that we didn't know about between the Obama administration and the Iranian that allowed them because they're going to be in violation of even reducing and getting rid of that low enrich uranium that they had to change the deal before or else they're going to be out of compliance.KELLY: I just want to move on to the next pointGOOLSBEE: Look, Megyn, We can have, we can have a negotiation if somebody - -KELLY: Hold that thought. What is the other whopper?THIESSENB: Well, the other whopper, he said, ""terrorist threat has been decreased on her watch."" I mean, good grief. Has he looked at the news in the last few months? I mean the fact is that when Hillary Clinton came into office in 2009, ISIS was completely defeated in Iraq. In fact, Joe Biden was running around saying Iraq was going to be one of the great achievements of the Obama administration.And then today, ISIS is all over the world, we've gotten attacks in Paris, Brussels, Nice, San Bernardino, Orlando. They have carried out according to CNN analysis, 143 attack in 29 countries that have killed 2,043 people since Barack Obama declared them the JV team. How is that terrorism being decreased?KELLY:M Austan?GOOLSBEE: Look, Megyn, we can have a foreign policy negotiation on terrorist attacks -- you failed to remember, I think, that the primary thing that the Republicans were criticizing was Al Qaeda. They took out Osama Bin Laden, they took out the infrastructure of Al Qaeda. The terrorism coming from central Asia and Afghanistan is reduced. It's true we have had a rise of ISIS sponsored terrorism in Europe, but many of the terrorist actions that you describe in the United States were homegrown terrorists.And so the policies of the Trump administration are not based on a intellectual debate like the one that Marc and I are having. Donald Trump's nuclear (inaudible) amounts to using a microwave oven. They have nonsense policies. And in this debate, I don't think we got into enough detail on those policies.KELLY: Yeah, I know. All right, oh, you meant the debate we just watched? I thought you were criticizing me. If you're criticizing...GOOLSBEE: No, the debate was just right (ph)KELLY: If we started earlier, that's a totally different story. Austan great to see you. Mark, you too.THIESSEN: Thanks Megyn.KELLY: Up next, Chris Stirewalt and Tucker Carlson are here on how folks are reacting to what the candidates said about dollars and cents, the economy. Oh, something shocking. Coming up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: What you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending. More deficits, more debt, more government and if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table. I mean, the truth of the matter is the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue have run this economy into a ditch.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: What you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government, and if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table. I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue have run this economy into a ditch.(CROSSTALK)PENCE: ...recovery since the Great Depression. There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side stepped on to the Oval office.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Governor Mike Pence's claims about the economy already being run through the fact checking mills so, we called up to our favorite mill workers, Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt along with ""Daily Caller"" founder and co-host of ""Fox & Friends"" Tucker Carlson, good to see you both.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Howdy.KELLY: That was just one of the many, I mean, exchange that they went on the economy, they hit everything, just little poll (ph) policy and so on. Tucker, overall, does this thing move the needle? Does it move the needle at all?TUCKER CARLSON, ""FOX & FRIENDS"" CO-HOST: It's pretty hard to know. I mean it wasn't bad for Trump. I think it's pretty clear that Pence won but in winning did he benefit anyone more than himself? I don't know. I do think there's a pretty large reservoir of voters who are open to voting for Trump but they're afraid of him. They think he's, you know, they think he's (inaudible) basically and volatile and did Pence's kind of calm irrational performance, I don't know.I think on the Kaine side, clearly, he was not there to win. I really don't think he was. This was a human sacrifice. He wanted to remind the demographics that they're worried about in terms of turnout which to the African-American, Latino and single female voters, that Trump is really bad and in case you somehow didn't hear this, in the last year he said this awful things about you. That's what this was about.  KELLY: Yes. And did he do that effectively? I mean...STIREWALT: I mean, the number one goal is the hippocratic oath as it applies to one base.KELLY: Do no harm.STIREWALT: First, do not harm. Whatever else you do, don't do any harm. Tim Kaine didn't helped himself. Mike Pence helped himself and probably a lot of (inaudible) conservative Republicans will watch -- will have watched Mike Pence and said I like that guy. Maybe someone will say, I wish he was the top of the ticket, that he will be at least reassuring to those sort of...KELLY: How about Kellyanne's suggestion that Kaine did do harm by -- she was suggesting it was sexist...(TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES)KELLY: He's not feeling that.STIREWALT: Look. This is the vice presidential debate. Vice presidential debates are remembered only when there is a catastrophic failure of some kind or some just astonishing thing happens. You -- sort of a Jack Kennedy -- You, sir, are no Jack Kennedy, said Lloyd Bentsen.KELLY: But even in that race Dan Qauyle won, you know.STIREWALT: And it don't matter. It ain't mattered. That's just the truth.CARLSON: It might help remind people that on the merits, it's pretty tough to defend the last eight years on the foreign policy side and on the economic side. I mean, clearly, I think you saw Pence allude to this, but we are facing some really ominous signs from the horizon. I mean, who doesn't think there's a debt crisis at least potentially coming our way. And that's the result of decisions that the people in power made. And so maybe he thinks it definitely reminds a person of that, that's got to help Trump, no?STIREWALT: And I think maybe...KELLY: So the non-partisan fact checkers who look into it suggest that Trump's plan is going to add $5 trillion to the debt.CARLSON: Sure. I mean...KELLY: So, I don't know.CARLSON: But it's not...KELLY: Tell me whether it helps him.CARLSON: But it's not, I mean, you could certainly make that case and I think it's a crazy thing to say. But it's not a contest between two incumbents. Really, all Trump needs to do is say these people have failed and I'm not so scary that you can vote for me.KELLY: Is it just me or is it like, listen, temperament is important.STIREWALT: Yes.CARLSON: Yes.KELLY: Nuclear codes and all that. If Trump is a misogynist, that's important. Half the country happen to be women.STIREWALT: What?KELLY: Yeah, and many of the other half has little girls...STIREWALT: This could be big.KELLY: But we have heard precious little about ISIS and terror and press (ph) to the homeland, and things that actually have people very concerned.STIREWALT: If there is one thing that Donald Trump could have been helped by in this debate, it was if he watched Mike Pence closely to see how you do that. So I absorb the blow, you attack me. OK, and you say, whatever, you're a jerk. And then you pivoted. And he did it on e-mails and he did it on Iran and he did it on ISSI. And time and time again when the attack came on Pence, he ably absorbed and deflected. So, if Trump was watching tonight and he was taking notes, this is how you do that.KELLY: He clearly was and his and his notepad begins with a T and ends with an R.STIREWALT: With a little bird on it.CARLSON: I wonder, I mean, there were one point stuck to me because I'm interested in the subject, but it was very revealing. You saw Tim Kaine say our priorities are immigration policies, reuniting families, which is great for the families.STIREWALT: I think it was a mess.CARLSON: But of course the pint of immigration policy is to help your country. And if the Trump people I think are clever they will exploit that because that is one of the essential points...KELLY: But Trump already got the people to whom immigration is important. He said they're already in his camp. Are they not? But I want to ask you this. You can answer that and then talk about the fact that we have a presidential debate happening in five days.CARLSON: Yes.KELLY: Five days. So, whatever news comes out of this gets squashed I guess, soon, because we're going to be focusing on the top of the ticket as fascinating is Pence and Kaine are.CARLSON: And I'd be surprised if the Trump people want to keep three days without talking about how great Pence is. I just thought...KELLY: He doesn't sound like Trump.CARLSON: I don't see that, right. But I do think...KELY: Whose name we found out today is not even on the Trump website. Governor Mike Pence was not mentioned apparently.CARLSON: Right. That's true. But I got to say, you know, if you watch just what was good about Pence, you know, he's kind of common rational. I don't know, I think that is a good lesson that is obvious.STIREWALT: Steady, stable, lots of balance, sober sided, seemed like an ordinary politician and some ways but in other ways, he seemed like a guy who was a leader, who was...KELLY: But now, we're five days away from the next presidential debate.STIREWALT: This will evaporate like a popsicle on a hot sidewalk. This does not have staying power. It was good to be here, but ain't going to last.KELLY: And on that note, get out. Great to see you. We'll be right back with some final thoughts after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So some on twitter are suggesting that a Trump advisor is out there saying Pence won overall but lost with Trump because he didn't defend Trump at every turn, but in the meantime, Donald Trump is tweeting this himself, ""Mike Pence won big. We should all be proud of Mike."" What do you think? Let us know. Go to foxnews.com I don't know, /facebook, it was like facebook.com/thekellyfile, on Twitter @megynkelly. Let me know what you think.
