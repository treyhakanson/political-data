This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 6, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, this is the ""The Five,"" I'm Dana Perino. Florida maybe just hours away from a direct hit by a Category 4 hurricane, has already killed more than 100 people. Hurricane Matthew could be the largest, most powerful storm to hit America in a decade. It's packing winds of up to a hundred and forty miles per hour. Florida's governor is warning this is life or death. There could be unprecedented damage and millions are about to lose power. The entire east coast is on alert. We have Fox team coverage tonight. Rick Reichmuth is tracking the storm from the Fox Weather Center; Jonathan Serrie is near Charleston, South Carolina, but we begin with Steve Harrigan, live in Wabasso Beach, Florida near Vero Beach and he is already taking a beating from the storm. Steve?STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Conditions here are just really getting started. We've seen some gusts of 30 to 40 miles per hour, the rain coming in now, a little bit now, a little bit sideways, the waves picking up as well over the course of the afternoon. The beach has pretty much disappeared. It's likely some of these resort properties in front of me could be under water by the day's end. The worst case scenario for the state of Florida would be a direct hit. That's something Governor Scott has been warning about. He says the results of a direct hit on Florida would be catastrophic. It would bring with it a hundred and forty mile per hour winds, that's enough to knock down houses, knock down big trees, knock off roofs, really destruction everywhere, as well as the storm surge of up to 10 feet in some places, well over my head. So people across the state bracing for it, he said if you live on the east coast of Florida, at the very minimum, you're going to lose electricity. And let's hope it doesn't get worse than that.PERINO: Steve, I had a question about the slow -- how slow moving this storm is. What are you hearing about the possibility of it going -- I guess right now 14 miles per hour. It's not moving very quickly and that would be more damaging, supposedly, if it hits the coast straight on.HARRIGAN: It would be more damaging. That means the storm would linger over the area, could bring with up to 12 inches of rain, and the scope of this storm would be tremendous as well. I mean we've got hurricane warnings all the way up from where I'm standing now, all the way up to north to Jacksonville. So, an enormous area of territory to try and keep people safe in, they've alerted National Guard across the state, they've opened shelters, but depending on the way the storm moves, then certainly not an exact science -- this could be a real challenge to try and keep people safe through the night.PERINO: All right. Kimberly?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Steve, are you getting the sense that people were heeding the warnings and are adequately prepared for this onslaught?HARRIGAN: I think people were scared. I think the governor was pretty effective in saying this could be a deadly storm. And he was effective in telling people who have never been through on here in Florida, 2 million people here have arrived in the past decade, they've never been through the last big storm. So, for a lot of people who didn't know, he has been saying over and over again this could be a deadly storm and you know it's hard to get a hotel room right now. It's hard to find water. There's a three-hour line at Home Depot. So I think people have heard the warnings for the most part.GUILFOYLE: All right, thanks.PERINO: All right. Thank you so much, Steve. We really appreciate all that you are doing. We will be going back to you throughout the coverage today and tomorrow. Let's go to Chief Meteorologist Rick Reichmuth, he is tracking the storm in the Fox Weather Center. What are you hearing, Rick?RICK REICHMUTH, CHIEF METEOROLOGIST: I hear interesting thing that Steve just mentioned to you. I think back to like Hurricane Andrew, a lot of the hurricanes that have hit Florida. They have hit directly, perpendicularly to the land and you have an incredible damage, very close to where the center of this comes onshore. This storm looks to be very different and we could be looking at incredible damage all up and down the eastern seaboard or -- excuse me, up and down the east coast of Florida. That means it's going to take a lot longer for first responders to get there. It's going to take longer to get power back on to your place, and that's why the potential scope of this storm is so much more damaging. The winds are still at a hundred and forty miles an hour. It's Category 4 storm. And this last images right there, you see that eye very well defined and the pressure -- this is the 5 o'clock advisory, the pressure has dropped a little bit. That means we are seeing it continue to strength and not seeing any signs of it weakening in the near future, which is not good news for Florida. So we're getting very close to Florida. Obviously, we have a hurricane warning in effect all the way up to just north of Charleston and down to the Miami area. And you see the storm getting very, very close, already obviously the rain moving into Florida all the way towards the western shores, by the way, of Florida. And we have a couple of things there, we've got an outer eye wall, want to go back to one picture here to show you this. We have that eye wall right there. That's probably where we have hurricane force winds. And then we have this very center eye wall and that's where we have the major hurricane, a hundred and forty mile an hour winds. If we see that crossover the shore, that's where we're going to see the worst of it and we hope that it stays just offshore. At this point, I will tell you all of our model gadget (ph) is narrowing closer and closer in, that we will be seeing it crossover and make some sort of landfall here across the eastern seaboard. Either way, you see this red, that's hurricane force winds, starts down around West Palm, goes all the way up through Jacksonville, all the way up across the Georgia coastline and eventually into South Carolina. This is the future radar. I just want to show you, get an idea here, the center of this right there around Port St. Lucie, crossing over shore, that's overnight tonight, it goes up in the entire coastline, eventually towards Jacksonville. And just by the way the ocean and the shore here are shaped. The worst of our storm surge is going to be up around Jacksonville and throughout Georgia, some spots here probably up to around 12 feet of storm surge. That is something that they have never seen there, and then you go up in to South Carolina, and that will probably be our biggest rainfall totals, some spots around 15 inches. So there is a widespread catastrophe going on for a really large area of land and a lot of people, guys.PERINO: Eric Bolling.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: So Rick, I think it's important to note, too, that even though it's a Category 4 and it may go down. Hurricane Katrina dropped to a Category 3 and it is created a hundred and twenty-five billion dollars in damage. Even Sandy, I think dropped to a one. The point being, that storm right there that you outline is going to run right up that whole I-95 corridor. There's a ton of infrastructure, there's a lot of damage that they could be taking. Could you tell our --REICHMUTH: For sure.BOLLING: Could you tell our audience about the dangers of being, even on 95 or inland a little bit as well?REICHMUTH: Yeah. So with -- Orlando is under a hurricane warning, so you go inland. We're going to be seeing probably hurricane force winds well inland. That's going to cause, probably some windows to be blown out, it's going to cause a lot of power outages, it's going to cause trees to fall houses and cars, and we oftentimes see fatalities of that. But the closer it gets to the coast, that's where we get the storm surge, and that's what the track is looking like now that it gets closer and closer right on to the shore. You mentioned that Katrina came onshore as a Category 3, it had been a Category 5 about 24 hours before that. Now when you have a storm surge and that's what caused most of the damage from Katrina, it doesn't go away right when the winds go down. It's a bunch of water that's piled up on the right side of the storm. And if the winds weaken a little bit before it makes landfall, that water doesn't all just displace right away. It still stays there. So the Category 4 storm, and by the way this has remained a major hurricane now for -- I want to say probably five days, so there's a lot of water that has piled up from this and it is not go going anywhere other than right into the Florida and Georgia coastline. So the storm surge is there even if it does maybe weaken to a Category 3, which as this point it will not happen until it gets it closer, probably towards north areas of Florida and into Georgia. Don't pay any attention to that. The effects are going to be just the same.PERINO: All right. Juan Williams?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Hey, Rick. So, you know I'm a big sports fan and I'm not in Florida this weekend, but I imagine they're going to cancel a ton of games, but going up the coast, I hear that North Carolina says, they may get some rain but they don't expect to get hit. Then what happens for Virginia, Maryland, there's a big baseball game in D.C. this weekend. What can we expect?REICHMUTH: I think just fine, to be honest with you. Earlier in the week we thought this is going to move in towards the northeast, a lot of people in the northeast, I've still been hearing in the New York saying, ""Hey, when are we getting the storm,"" because they had heard that earlier in the week. That is off the table. We thought it was going to go to the north. It's not going to happen. It is going to stay here and probably move offshore somewhere around south or North Carolina. And then actually, I hate to tell you this, but let me just show you this. This track that you see right here going up the coast and then here coming off maybe somewhere of the South Carolina coastline, and then at this point, it looks like it comes back down here. Weakens considerably, but we could end up making a play around six days somewhere around the Florida coastline from a much weaker storm, but if you have infrastructure problems here because of what the storm we are seeing now and you get maybe a strong tropical storm by the end of it coming back, that's big problems. To answer your other question, though, north of that, maybe into North Carolina, you will going to see some rain, maybe a few showers in towards Virginia and there's a little bit of a front-moving through, apart from that that will reach rain, but the most part, mid-Atlantic and into the northeast, you're going to be fine from the storm.WILLIAMS: Thanks, Rick.PERINO: All right. Thank you, Rick. South Carolina is expected to start feeling that, to use wrath tomorrow and a mass exodus on the coast is already underway there. Jonathan Serrie is at Folly Beach near Charleston with the latest. Jonathan, I know that they've -- just in Charleston about a year ago they had all of that flooding that they had to deal with. What do you hear on the streets now?JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. They did, indeed, have that flooding and then they are worried about additional flooding from a combination of factors. Storm surge on the coast and even further up away from the coast because there are so many tributaries that are feeding in into the Atlantic that are affected potentially by storm surge, and then also from all of the rain that they are expecting from this very slow moving storm, so we can expect flooding here in South Carolina. As for the heavy winds we're expecting, you see people are already boarding up their businesses here on Folly Beach. Many residents say once they finish boarding up they are going to evacuate this island community, not wanting to take any chances. The governor, Nikki Haley, has a warning for those who decide to stay.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NIKKI HALEY, SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR: But my biggest concern right now is that residents that don't leave today are going to realize suddenly there's nothing open. So they're going to be able so to have access to anything. We want to make sure that you realize when those things close down, there's nothing that we're going to be able to do to help.(END VIDEO CLIP)SERRIE: Gas stations, grocery stores and pharmacies will eventually close to expedite evacuations from the low country, state highway, if this will continue, to keep a reverse flow of traffic on the east bound lanes of Interstate-26. In other words, all lines of I-26 between Charleston and Columbia are moving west, carrying people away from the coast, away from the low country and into the midlands. But the reverse lanes do not allow you to exit along the 100 mile route, so motorists need to make sure they have plenty of fuel. So far, there are no major shortages of fuel reported at gas stations which, by and large, remain open even here in the low country. But as the governor warns, these gas stations will eventually close once the hurricane gets closer. Back to you guys.PERINO: All right. Greg Gutfeld?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Jonathan, I'm a bay area kid, so I'm -- I've never experienced this kind of like mass evacuation thing. And I keep thinking about, not the families getting in the cars but like hospitals and rest homes. I can't imagine the undertaking involved in moving people who can't move themselves. I'm wondering, how do they deal with it, what -- how do they get everybody out?SERRIE: Yeah, it's a huge undertaking. They've been bringing them by the bus loads. The Department of Health and Environmental Control has been carrying nursing home patients from the state-run nursing homes and other medical facilities to -- facilities in higher ground. And then for poor folks or the elderly who simply don't have their own means of getting out of here, they don't have access to their own vehicles, they have sent in more than 300 buses from the upstate region of South Carolina to pick up low country residents and then bring them back to shelters in the upstate. So the -- it is a massive undertaking getting folks who are not able to drive themselves out of this region.GUTFELD: I'm just thinking of the worst case scenario. When you are in a hospital and you -- and like, you can't go on a bus, you're, if you are in traction or intensive care. How do you move patients? I find that so mind- boggling in some kind of catastrophe -- to me.SERRIE: Yes, for those patients who are critically ill and not able to board or sit on a bus, they're actually being carried by ambulance and at times we've seen caravans of ambulances lined up, ready to pick up those more severe cases.PERINO: All right, last question to Juan Williams?WILLIAMS: Jonathan, imagine on the street, you run into store owners who say, ""You know what, I'm going to stick around. I'm gonna -- I can, I can, I can survive this. I went through what happened in some other hurricane."" And then you run into individuals who say, ""I just don't want to go. I don't care what the governor or the mayor says. I'm staying."" Is that your experience?SERRIE: Oh, absolutely. There are some people who say that they left during previous storms and then they came back to find the storm had created damage. So they felt that somehow they could have prevented it if they were there, that they could take evasive action at the last minute to deal with the storm, whatever it was dishing out, as it unfolded. And so that's a common theme that you are going to hear among a lot of people who have decided to stay. But on the other side of the fence, there are a lot of people here on Folly Beach, in particular, which was devastated in 1989 by Hurricane Hugo who say, ""We're leaving, we don't want to take any chances.""PERINO: All right. Thank you, Jonathan. We'll be monitoring this catastrophic storm throughout the hour and have much more ahead. We're going to turn to some politics next. Bill Clinton delivered Donald Trump a gift of sorts when he criticized ObamaCare on the trail this week. The GOP nominee is now using it to his advantage. You will see how, up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: ObamaCare hadn't gotten much attention this election cycle until this week when Bill Clinton, of all people pointed out what a crazy mess it is. Donald Trump, of course, wasn't going to let that one slide, so he put out an ad, a campaign ad to feature it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I want to defend the Affordable Care Act. It is one of the great accomplishments, not only of this president but of the Democratic Party going back to Harry Truman.BILL CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: It doesn't make any sense. The insurance model doesn't work here. It's not like life insurance. It's not like casualty. It's like predictive flood. It doesn't work.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Well, the GOP nominee also says apologies are in order for the health care disaster.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They're always telling me, oh, if you say stuff, just apologize. Just apologize. I think that President Obama should apologize for ObamaCare.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And I think that Hillary Clinton should apologize for pursuing ObamaCare, and she wants to make it even worse than it is right now. We're going to repeal it and we're going to replace it with much less expensive and much better care.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Let's go to Juan first. Juan, here are the numbers. ObamaCare, the cost to the Americans since ObamaCare became law is up 30 percent since it was signed into law; Tennessee, up 62 percent rate increase for 2017; Kentucky, 47 percent; Iowa, 42 percent increase; Nebraska, 39 percent; Maryland, 31 percent. What's working in the ObamaCare?WILLIAMS: What's working? My, gosh, it's a tremendous success. I mean it's just, no getting away from it. Remember the goal was --GUTFELD: People are trying to get away from it.WILLIAMS: They increased the number of people with health insurance in America and you are up more than 20 million people, Eric. Now have health insurance.BOLLING: Then the cause is up 30 percent.WILLIAMS: Hold on. You asked me, and I'm going to tell you.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Remember, people said, ""Oh, this is going to be a job's killer. Oh no, the economy has continued to grow."" People say it's going to impact people who get their insurance from employers. It's not budge. People said it would add to the deficit. Not true. And you know, what's incredible to me is, 20 million more people covered, you can now get insurance if have pre-existing conditions. You know, this to me is just a success. The problem is here is .BOLLING: So --WILLIAMS: . what President Clinton said, that people who are right above that sort of poverty level that allows them in with subsidies are, as the president said, busting their tail, doing hard work, and you got a lot of small businesses .BOLLING: What?WILLIAMS: . who don't get the subsidies, and they are being punished.BOLLING: All right. We got to get around Juan. So Dana --WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just telling you --BOLLING: So Dana, 20 -- Juan points out accurately, 20 million more people has ObamaCare -- have healthcare, that's about what 7 percent of the country. However, costs for the rest of the country are up 30 percent. The people are paying for those -- 20 million people are paying 30 percent more. Remember they sold it. We're going to bend the cost curve down --PERINO: Oh, I just wrote that down. Yes, bend the cost curve down and keep your doctor. And I agree, there are -- there were ways and -- that I think he could have increased coverage for lots of people, the 20 million, in other ways. I do think that pre-existing conditions is something that republicans could have signed up for. Remember, not a single republican voted for this. And what you have is that acts of small business owners are the ones that have to be broken over this. And they are the ones, if you look at Trump's support, a lot of that comes from those people who feel like the government has just obviously beaten them down and ignored them. Coverage -- the quality of coverage is down. If you are an independent person, buys your health insurance on the individual market, you end up with a letter every six months, ""oh, hey, our insurance company, we're going to pull out of your market,"" that happened to us several times in my household. Reluctance to expand number of employees, I think that's a huge economic cost that small businesses are talking about and it's one of the reasons that the economic growth in the country has been so lackluster in this recovery. They also don't get subsidies and there's less choice, so there's --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: There are a lot of things that I think what Bill Clinton did is finally said the truth of what republicans should have been talking about. I think this will probably help senate republicans in tough races to talk about. And the one thing that is difficult for Donald Trump and all republican is describing then what would you do about it? What would you fix?WILLIAMS: Oh my God, this is --PERINO: When he says that he -- when he --WILLIAMS: This is pure and honest womanPERINO: When he says repeal and replace, what do you mean by that? And so in the debate this Sunday night, I think the two candidates will have that fight. And what Donald Trump can do is talk to Paul Ryan this weekend. They're going to have their first joint campaign appearance in Wisconsin. Paul Ryan has good answers on this and he should listen to him before that debate.BOLLING: And so Greg, one of the ideas has been -- that's been floated on - - Trump floated the idea with the republicans certainly have her health savings accounts.GUTFELD: Yeah, health savings accounts have been around for, how many?PERINO: But then they do, eliminated the .GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: . ObamaCare.GUTFELD: Yeah, that they have been around -- I mean, I think Reagan even talked about it. But I know Jack Kemp pushed them.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: Promise, every social program is never bad, no matter how it -- no matter how the consequences -- because you don't think about the consequences. They never connect the dots. So no matter what, a social program is always a success, even if it is a failure. It's -- they, when you promise free stuff, it's always going to be on the backs of the earners until ultimately .PERINO: Yeah.GUTFELD: . it collapses. It's the fault -- it's never the fault of the ideology. No liberal will say it's because of liberalism. It's faulted in the implementation, like socialism is faultless. It's the human being who fails at socialism, although socialism is only meant for socialism. It's not for humans.GUILFOYLE: Like you seeing this happens, this was predicted, right?PERINO: Yes.GUILFOYLE: That what we are going to see the truth was going to reveal itself and that you would see across the country that people will be paying higher premiums and that they would be receiving less options in terms of the some of these states you see only one option of an insurer. It's really bad and you see ""The Wall Street Journal,"" they have the whole example in piece in op-ed written about Tennessee.BOLLING: Tennessee, yeah.GUILFOYLE: Fifty-four percent in terms of the increases there. It's very --BOLLING: Sixty-tow percent.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, it's very challenging now for people to be able to get it. So it's not even just the fact that families and people are paying more. You are getting not as good quality care and this is also tightening the noose around small businesses because people that are having to cutback because they cannot afford to ensure that number of employees .(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: And seeking part-time workers (inaudible).BOLLING: The reason why costs go up -- we have to go. They're teasing us. We got to go. But the reason why costs go up is when there are no competitions. Dana pointed out different companies are pulling out of different markets in some --PERINO: Out of Manhattan.BOLLING: You go to ""The Wall Street Journal"" and go to Fox News research on Twitter. They have some amazing numbers about people, companies that are just completely pulling out where you are left with one choice. And we have one choice, what happens?WILLIAMS: Status quo.BOLLING: You have to pay their price.WILLIAMS: Yeah, the status quo is unacceptable, right?GUTFELD: Yeah, but this -- the (inaudible) program, it works.PERINO: The current status quo is unaccepted too.BOLLING: All right. We got to go.GUILFOYLE: -- which is created by Obama .WILLIAMS: No.GUILFOYLE: . and Hillary and (inaudible).WILLIAMS: The status quo is the market that Greg doesn't like.GUTFELD: And also a great British band.BOLLING: We have to leave it right there. It's probably not a good idea to have a 9/11 trotter anywhere near what you, when you are running for president, but Hillary Clinton doesn't care. She just invited one to perform of her donors. That's, plus a live update on Hurricane Matthew, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REICHMUTH: This is a Fox News weather alert. I'm your meteorologist, Rick Reichmuth. We continue to track Hurricane Matthew, the 5 o'clock advisory came out and it is now a hundred miles east southeast of West Palm Beach in the center of the storm getting very, very organized. Pressure has dropped a bit, that means we are seeing a strengthening storm. We would like to see a weakening storm getting closer to shore, but that's not the case and that potentially means that we could be dealing with an even worse situation across the Florida coast. This is the radar. That right there, that outer eye wall has hurricane force winds. The center of it as it is a very small center.That's where we have those hundred and forty miles an hour winds, and if we see that make landfall, that's where we would see catastrophic conditions. We have hurricane warnings in effect from just north of Miami, now all the way up including just to the north of the Charleston, South Carolina. Tropical storm watches in effect for parts of North Carolina as well. We are expecting to see a big storm surge especially if this pulls onshore and that is the -- what most of our indicators are now is that it will. We will see a historic storm surge probably one in a 500 year event here from parts of South Carolina through the Georgia coastline and then just down towards the space coast of Florida. Expect to see major damage and it look like overnight tonight, throughout a much of a day tomorrow, the storm is going to rake the entire Florida coast and then hug the Georgia and South Carolina coastline, as well. We'll continue to track it all right, all here at FOX Weather Center. Right now we'll send it back to ""The Five.""GUTFELD: Next Friday, Hillary hosts a fund-raiser. The featured celeb is a rapper named Macklemore. He's not very good, which is why he's a truther, tweeting eight years after 9/11, ""9/11, Bush knocked down the towers."" So how brave, how thoughtful and how easy it is to say such things years later, far from families and the victims or the thousands of scarred witnesses who saw the planes hit.Truthers are rarely close to the suffering, just close to the attention they get for milking it. And you know the talent is pedestrian when he needs to spout such crap to attract additional media.Trutherism is a belief that negates your entire persona. You could be the nicest, sweetest person ever, but if you're a truther, you're dirt.Of course, Hillary has no clue who this guy is or why she should avoid him. She probably thinks Macklemore is a hemorrhoid cream. Kind of is.Sadly, the conspiracy virus masquerading as thought infects the other side, too. Trump's mad theories include Ted Cruz's dad killing JFK, the CDC lying about Ebola, and vaccines causing autism. We can only hope he doesn't really believe the things that he tweets.But the problem with conspiracies, they attract everyone. It just feels good to think you know something others don't. When in fact, conspiracies replace knowledge, making them a great way to lose three pounds, which happens to be the weight of your average brain.So Eric, you were here 9/11. Could you sit in a room with a truther?BOLLING: I hate the fact he's -- he's wildly talented, though. I think he's fantastically talented.GUTFELD: He ripped off his...BOLLING: OK. But there's a lot of that going on. I think he's fantastic. I think he's written some amazing music. But...GUTFELD: He stole it.BOLLING: That bothers me, the truther part. It's bothered me since -- since that day. People -- people continue to claim that this was an inside job or that 7 World Trade Center, there were, you know, explosives planted and that thing came down later.I watched planes fly into that building. There was no question that terrorists flew planes into buildings and 3,000 people died. Hillary Clinton, I think she makes a big mistake. Because although he has a social agenda very similar to what she's speaking on the campaign trail, which is why she probably hired him, she should have investigated a little bit further his Twitter account, found out. The truther part of him will push people away.GUTFELD: See, it doesn't matter to her, though. Right? Because millennials! Millennials! He's young. He's actually in his mid-30s.PERINO: This is a very dangerous conspiracy theory. It's not just held by Macklemore. It's held by people who are actually wanting to be leaders of this country. And it's awful.GUTFELD: Can you say who that is?PERINO: It's ignorant. And it is extremely dangerous.In the Muslim world, there was a rumor going around that all the Jews didn't go to work that day, because they had inside information.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: That is not true.And you could only hope that people who suggest this are never in a position where they are actually the leader of the country, and they get accused of being somebody who was complicit in the killing of 3,000 of your citizens. I feel pretty strongly about it.GUTFELD: I know.GUILFOYLE: I think it's ill-advised. I don't know why she would make such a rookie mistake with something like this. It's really going to do her no amount of any positive good. I mean, it's only going to upset people and anger people.And as you see right away, the other side is going to use it against her. And it should be held against her. Because she shouldn't have somebody like that there, not like, what, 30 days or 100 days out before a presidential election.GUTFELD: Juan.WILLIAMS: You guys ever hear of Alex Jones?GUTFELD: Yes. Unfortunately.WILLIAMS: And you know Trump and Alex Jones...GUTFELD: I know.PERINO: That's what I was talking about.WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying, you were trying -- you know the thing about you, you're polite. And you don't want to just...PERINO: My downfall.WILLIAMS: OK, but I'm just saying, let's be direct. I don't know how you guys are condemning Hillary Clinton.GUTFELD: I condemn both, Juan.WILLIAMS: But I'll say this. This guy is now speaking to a huge crisis in the country with opioid abuse. And he says that he had the addiction, and he can stand up and give personal testimony.But the business about 9/11 truthers, those people are really disgusting to me.GUTFELD: Yes, all right. I think we agree on that.We look ahead to the second presidential debate on Sunday. Next, who will fare better in the town hall format with voters, Clinton or Trump?And we are closely following the deadly hurricane headed right for Florida. A live update ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: The next presidential debate is just three days away. And there is no room for error on either side. This race still remains tight. And the latest Real Clear Politics average shows Clinton is only four points ahead.She's off the trail today to prepare for Sunday's showdown. But Trump isn't. He's doing a town hall tonight in New Hampshire, perhaps a dry run for the big one this weekend.Both campaigns think their nominees will do quite well with the format of the next debate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN PODESTA, CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN: I think Hillary did a lot of town hall debates during -- and a lot of town halls during the course of the primaries and into the general. So she's very used to the format. She likes it. She likes answering questions from individual citizens. You know, she listens hard and relates to people.And that's a format that Donald Trump isn't as used to. And so we'll see.JASON MILLER, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS ADVISOR: I think especially with the town hall format that we're going to see Sunday night, this is really an opportunity for Mr. Trump to do well. I think this is a format that allows him to connect with people. And I don't know if Secretary Clinton can memorize enough lines to do well on Sunday.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. So based on the format, both sides are going to say they have an advantage. Right? They're going to say, ""Our person is prepared."" But I have to think, if I'm thinking about it, Dana, that Trump has been do doing a lot, a lot, a lot of town halls. So does that weigh to his advantage? Hillary has been avoiding even press conferences for hundreds of days.PERINO: I think this is actually a format that works better for both of them. It's just -- it's frankly just more natural for all of us, if you were in a room, rather than standing up at two podiums, and then there's a moderator, and then you're talking through that person. And there's the cameras right in front of you.If you are able to talk to a crowd -- and both of these people are very comfortable doing that, Trump probably even more so than Hillary Clinton. I think it's a good one for both of them. They need to win. I think this is going to be a high stakes debate, one to watch Sunday night.GUILFOYLE: All right. Eric, what do you think? Advantage to? If you're Vegas, call the odds.BOLLING: I think advantage nobody. I think advantage American people. I agree with Dana. Because I think you'll get a lot more information that comes out.I think there's a funny side story going on, that Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz are kind of haggling, they're fighting a little bit about who's going to -- who's going to get the spotlight. And the point I'm trying to make is I hope they don't try and take the spotlight away from the two candidates.Let them -- let the questions be asked. And I think these questions are being chosen from audience participation. They send them in. They'll pick the questions.But again, why would moderators fight over being the most important moderator? You're not even -- we shouldn't even know they're there. As 00 which I think Elaine Quijano did a great job doing that.PERINO: I think that both of them probably -- it might be a little bit overblown in terms of they're having any struggles behind the scenes. But on the record, they say everything is fine. Everything's just fine.GUILFOYLE: Exactly. Well, let the candidates do the talking, I think.All right, Juan, what do you think about this? Are you looking forward to Sunday?WILLIAMS: Yes. I mean, I love debates. I love politics. But I think that the clear advantage...GUILFOYLE: You should do it for a living.WILLIAMS: ... to Mrs. Clinton, given that she is so accustomed to this format. She has a big advantage, I think, in that.Now, what's interesting about this is Gallup picks the people who ask the question, not the campaigns. So Gallup has gone out and found people who are declared as undecided voters. And then they asked the question.So if you're inside the campaign, and you're trying to train your candidate, what you're trying to do is you have to know the issue, but that's not enough. It's like when Eric and I go at it, I've got to convey to Eric that I understand his position; and I appreciate it and I can feel whatever pain is behind it.GUILFOYLE: How's that going?WILLIAMS: I know. It's hard.GUILFOYLE: Not too good.WILLIAMS: That -- that's the challenge. And I don't see that -- I mean, Trump is easy at dissing people, but I don't know about empathy.GUILFOYLE: All right. OK. Let's work on that empathy.OK, Greggins.GUTFELD: OK. It's Hillary versus Trump 2. Will it be like ""Jaws 2,"" which is not very good? Will it be ""The Godfather 2,"" which was great? Or will it be ""Evil Dead 2,"" perhaps the greatest ever. Thank you, laughter by the cameraman. Everybody -- everybody behind me watches ""Evil Dead 2.""This is going to be messier than a rest room at a chili festival.GUILFOYLE: Oh!WILLIAMS: Eww.GUTFELD: I think that...GUILFOYLE: Terrible.GUTFELD: ... Trump should learn a little bit from Pence. Why did Pence resonate? Calm professionalism, reassurance, and I think that would be helpful. He's still got to, you know, take it to Hillary. But he's got to do it in kind of an authoritative manner, not a cheap way. That's my analysis.GUILFOYLE: Unflappable. He was -- yes, very good, very good -- that was nice. And we're not even getting screamed at for being over time. So we're going to leave it there.Ahead, we're going to get a live update from Florida on the status of Hurricane Matthew. The Category 4 storm is threatening millions along the East Coast. We cannot emphasize how serious this is. Please stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: There's a Category 4 hurricane fast approaching Florida, and the governor is warning it will kill people in its path. He warned anyone and everyone on the coast to evacuate, get out.Leland Vitter is live in Daytona Beach with the latest on what's going on there -- Leland.LELAND VITTER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Juan, as a great reporter, you know that there's the macro view from the governor, the micro view from the local police chief here in Daytona Beach. And he told us it is not a matter of ""if"" but when Hurricane Matthew kills people here in Volusia County that is going to take a direct hit.You look out to the Atlantic right now. It has been kicking up pretty good for the past couple of hours or so. The wind has been picking up, as well. And that's the real fear here. Not only the wind that could hit 140 miles an hour. Many of the hotels along this strip are not rated for that in terms of either the structure or the windows.But the real fear here is the storm surge that is going to come up not only up this beach, but there's not much of a dune, as our Greg Gursky pointed out, to be able to stop this storm surge. Comes right up here, will be well over that green railing, and then slam into this wall of businesses.And remember, businesses like this are all up and down the Atlantic seaboard. And it's not just those that are boarded up three, four, five blocks in here in Volusia County that are boarded up, Brevard County. What makes Matthew so dangerous and so unusual as a hurricane is it is not coming across the state of Florida but coming up the coastline.If you will, this would be the coast of Florida. Typically when we talk about the bull's eye, we talk about one city that the hurricane track will come across and through. And then it weakens once it gets over land.This hurricane is going to come all the way up the coast of Florida. And as it comes up the coast of Florida, it is the warm water that is out here in the Atlantic that will continue to fuel this. And this is why Matthew will remain such a powerful storm for so long, why it is potentially such a deadly storm as we head -- have already seen.At 6 o'clock, they say they want people off the roads. At sundown, the beach access roads and the bridges all close. And at that point, they're telling us that police will not come out and put their own lives at risk. It will be simply impossible to reach people who call 911 and have not already heeded their warnings to take shelter. Only a couple of hours left, Juan.WILLIAMS: Leland, what about you? Like, what will you do tonight? And where will you stay?VITTER: Where we will stay is a very good question. We're going to move inland off the barrier islands here. Because once the winds hit 50 miles an hour, we can't get off the island, and it could be potentially dangerous. Also, there's no real ability to move around and tell the story.So once we get inland, we're going to hook up with the Daytona Beach police chief, Chet Wood, who's a great guy, an old friend of mine from when I was down here as a reporter. He's going to take us around in some of their much larger SUVs and pickup trucks and try to show us the brave work that they're doing through the storm.Keep this in mind, Juan. Not only are all the police working overtime, they have canceled everybody's days off and they have canceled everybody's hours off. Every police officer is reporting to work for 20-hour shifts. That's how seriously they are taking this storm. And still, they have told so many residents, ""We may not be able to come get you if you need help. It may simply be overwhelming for us"" -- JuanWILLIAMS: Leland, we'll be following you. Take care of yourself and take care of the crew. We appreciate your being there so much.""One More Thing"" up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" Now, this is the moment that Greg has been waiting for.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: We have a little bit of a preview, and you can preorder this now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Before there was Jasper there was Henry. And a lot of people know that, if they knew me from when I was the White House press secretary. So I write a chapter called ""Henry's Last Win,"" which I think a lot of people that have had pets and have had to say good-bye to them will be able to relate to it. It also led me to additional and bigger joy in my life with another dog, Jasper.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I love that, when Jasper looked at those pictures of Henry, and we filmed that. I love that. Anyway, you can preorder this now. I'm excited about it. It's called ""Let Me Tell You About Jasper: How My Best Friend Became America's Dog."" And everybody that watches ""The Five"" has been with me on this Jasper journey. So...BOLLING: Barnes and Noble...PERINO: All of them. All the stores.GUILFOYLE: I have to say, when we started ""The Five,"" it was with Henry...PERINO: It was with Henry.GUILFOYLE: ... who I'm very fond of. God bless him.PERINO: Six months later...GUTFELD: Nobody cares about my dog, Casper.PERINO: No. Nobody remembers him, anyway.Kimberly, you're next.GUTFELD: It was an accident.GUILFOYLE: So this is very -- Dana, the other day you did something that was very touching when you talked about the Facebook Friday. And we wrote -- we talked about what we wished and we missed most from our childhood that we no longer have anymore.PERINO: Yes.GUILFOYLE: And I was, like, ""Oh, I wish someone would get the Pooh bear."" And then -- I thought it. And then there it was up in my office.PERINO: How sweet.GUILFOYLE: Very sweet. And this is from Mary Sicilian (ph). She wrote me a lovely card. It said, ""Dear Kimberly, I love 'The Five.' The other day when you said you wish you still had the Winnie the Pooh bear that your mother gave you, started to cry. My mom died when I was in high school, so I can relate to your wish. I'm a 50-year-old mother of four children that still has and sleeps with the teddy bear that I clung to the night my mom died of cancer. I just felt the need to send you Pooh. I know that this will never replace your bear from your mom. I wanted you to know that my heart goes out to you, and I feel for you. All the best. Mary Sicilian (ph)."" How sweet.PERINO: There are some lovely people in the world.GUILFOYLE: And thoughtful, right?PERINO: Yes. So nice.GUILFOYLE: You got your children's Bible.PERINO: Oh, my gosh.GUILFOYLE: Very, very sweet.PERINO: I don't remember what Greg asked for.BOLLING: Same thing.GUILFOYLE: Here's a note from Mary Sicilian (ph).GUTFELD: It was a case of whiskey. A case of whiskey, and I still haven't got it.GUILFOYLE: P. -- Greg, ""P.S., please tell Greg that I wasn't compelled to replace his Playboy magazines."" Mary Sicilian (ph), kind heart and a sense of humor.PERINO: Yes, thank you, Mary, for not putting those...GUILFOYLE: Thank you.PERINO: That is so great. Juan, you're next.WILLIAMS: Well, you know, we're all worried about the hurricane. But let me ask you a question. What about sharks?Because it turns out that right off the Montauk Point coast here in Long Island in New York, they have found white sharks, Great White Sharks.PERINO: Oh, boy.WILLIAMS: I'm thinking maybe Greg put a robot out there, but no, this is an actual Great White Shark. And not only that, they've now determined that it's a nursery in the northwest Atlantic for Great White Sharks right here, New York state. So this is worse than ""Jaws"" or Shark Week.GUTFELD: That's where ""Jaws"" was.WILLIAMS: Yes. I'm telling you.BOLLING: Montauk is rife with sharks.GUTFELD: That's where they filmed it.WILLIAMS: Yes, and they invited...GUILFOYLE: That's why I stay in the restaurants, sipping nice drink with an umbrella, and not in the wawa.BOLLING: OK. I guess the rare part was that it was a Great White.WILLIAMS: Great White.BOLLING: Versus other stuff.WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: Very popular place.GUTFELD: So racist.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.GUTFELD: Why does the white have to be great?PERINO: It doesn't.GUTFELD: It doesn't.PERINO: It clearly is not.GUTFELD: Great White was a band.Finally, a mystery has been solved. Donald Trump visited the International Christian Academy in Las Vegas and went to a classroom. And this happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm nervous. I'm nervous. I'm nervous.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See, Anna, I told you his hair wasn't orange.DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Does everybody love school?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes!(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: That's the great thing about kids. They'll say some of the craziest things. That should be an idea for a TV show. Kids say, like, the craziest things.PERINO: That's a job I want in television.GUTFELD: No. No, you don't.PERINO: I want to do that job.GUTFELD: Oh, yes.PERINO: Asking kids crazy things?GUTFELD: No, you'd want to -- asking dogs crazy things.PERINO: OK, I'll take that, too.GUTFELD: Any way, the children -- the child was promptly arrested.PERINO: New weekend programming.GUILFOYLE: Not just children. TV people, too.GUTFELD: Trump had the child evicted.BOLLING: She was -- she was hired by Hillary.PERINO: All right. Eric Bolling.BOLLING: OK, I'll go. So yesterday we talked about the...WILLIAMS: Other way, other way.BOLLING: I'll do that in a second.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.BOLLING: But last night, I saw an amazing -- I'm hooked on ""Designated Survivor.""PERINO: Oh, I've heard it's good.BOLLING: It's awesome, great.GUILFOYLE: Is that with our little Jack Bauer, Keifer Sutherland?BOLLING: With the Jack Bauer guy. Fantastic.GUILFOYLE: I want to -- yes, you watch it?BOLLING: As much as we talk about politics, everyone should check that out.PERINO: That's where they have the continuity of government problem?BOLLING: Exactly. The only survivor. They keep some -- anyway, to make a long story short, yesterday we talked about the Senate, how do the Republicans keep the Senate.Here's the House. There's a big piece in the New York Times today saying that inside the GOP, people are worried about Republicans keeping the house. I would say that not much to worry about.All 435 seats are contested. Right now, currently, it's 188 Dems, 247 Republicans. Real Clear Politics says these are the safe seats, 189 for the Democrats, 231 for Republicans. That alone will keep the House in the Republican side.But three big races I wanted to highlight. Danny Tarkanian (ph), Nevada 3, that's Las Vegas. Arizona 1, which is Paul Babu (ph). Remember Sheriff Paul Babu (ph)? He's running. These are tossups right now, but they're looking good. We hope they go to the Republican side.And Jason Lewis (ph), a talk show host in Minnesota, number two.So as far as this goes, it looks like the House should stay.GUILFOYLE: But you know what?PERINO: Do you know what's amazing? That out of 435 House seats, there are only about 20 that are really, truly competitive seats. That's amazing.WILLIAMS: And you know why? And you know why they're worried, Eric?BOLLING: Why?PERINO: I've got to run, Juan.WILLIAMS: They're worried because of Donald Trump.PERINO: That's it for us, Juan. Keep it here on the FOX News Channel throughout the night for continuing coverage of Hurricane Matthew. To those on the East Coast, please stay safe.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" September 2, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest a little vague on the timing of some action by the president today, but it's now believed that the White House will hold off on any executive order until after the midterm elections. Why? Because of vulnerable Democrats in some Senate races, including Kay Hagan, Mark Pryor, Mary Landrieu, and Mark Begich, all of whom have weighed in on this issue. A.B.?A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: Well, they got through to the White House, and the White House has actually changed its mind on whether or not this was going to be a real boon to get out the Latino vote for Democrats in this election. It turned out it might have helped Senator Udall in Colorado. But that would not have made up for -- it would have been overwhelmed by the backlash that it would have produced. You know, if there was no border crisis that we now know President Obama had ignored for two years, if there was no ISIS, you could imagine this might be something that energized Democrats. But people who support comprehensive immigration reform don't like -- after this border crisis -- how out of control it got, the idea of the president going over the Congress. We're looking at a global threat to our national security and he's talking about picking a giant political fight? They basically just relayed it was going to be political suicide, and they listened.BAIER: Let's just quickly tick through these Real Clear Politics average of polls in these states, the key ones. North Carolina first, Kay Hagan trailing by a point in the latest RCP average there. You have Alaska, you have a five-point lead or a little bit less for the incumbent, Mark Begich.  New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen with a lead over Scott Brown. Obviously, that's not definitive. His primary is September 9th. But a lot of people putting him on the comparison. Colorado, as A.B. mentioned, Udall ahead barely. That could turn on Hispanic vote, really the only state in this list that could. Arkansas, Cotton up by a little bit less than two. And Louisiana, you see Cassidy up by one over incumbent Mary Landrieu. OK, Steve?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the private polling Republicans have is a little bit more favorable to Republicans. It depends on how you screen. But having said that, look, I think there's no question that what the president did he did because of politics. And when he stands up in front of the country and says have no doubt I will act soon, every time he says, ""have no doubt,"" I'm inclined to really have quite a few doubts.BAIER: Have doubt?HAYES: Have a few doubts, right. In effect, he said he was going to act soon and the politics weren't going to be at play. And we now know he's probably not going act soon, and that the politics is the reason.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, I think A.B. is right that the losses the Democrats would incur if Obama were to act unilaterally would overwhelm the gains he would make in a few states.BAIER: Because of independents, who are polled against this.KRAUTHAMMER: Right, A, because of the policy, and, B, it would enormously energize conservatives and others who simply have respect for the Constitution. It would be the most egregious way for him to usurp the powers of Congress, legalizing millions of illegal aliens that everybody understands is the job of Congress and not of the president added on to all the other raids on the prerogatives of the other branches. So I think this imperial presidency idea would hurt him as well as people who would object on the basis of the policy.STODDARD: I think it would look irresponsible, like I said, in light of our national security issue. But in the case of the Shaheen-Brown race, Brown was down by 12 and started attacking Jeanne Shaheen, the incumbent, on this issue, and has closed the gap with that issue alone. And so they had evidence that it was going to harm the candidates.BAIER: But of the states, Colorado really being the only one in the list where maybe moves the needle the other way?HAYES: Right, I think that's exactly right. But, look, Republicans should pound Democrats on this issue. The president has made clear what he intends to do eventually. The question is whether Democratic candidates would support him when he does it.KRAUTHAMMER: And the crisis at the border actually shifted radically public opinion on this. It was a slam-dunk Democratic issue. It isn't anymore.BAIER: That's it for the panel. But stay tuned for an uplifting story, how about that, after a very difficult news day.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
