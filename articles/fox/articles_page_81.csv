This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!BILL: ""Factor Follow up Segment"" tonight, last night we played you a clip of Michigan State University professor, William Penn telling his English class that Republicans are evil. The professor's rant was totally out of context to the class and downright vicious.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM PENN, PROFESSOR, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY: I'm a college professor. If I found out you're a closet racist I am coming after you, okay? This country still is full of closet racists. What do you think is going on in South Carolina and North Carolina? Voter suppression is about getting black people not to vote. Why? Because black people tend to vote Democratic. And why would Republicans want to deal with that, because Republicans are not a majority in this country anymore. They're a bunch of dead white people, or dying white people.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Now Penn has been reassigned by the university and taken out of the classroom. Joining us from Lansing, Michigan, 19 year old Evan Schrage, a sophomore at Michigan State. He was the student who taped Penn's remarks.First of all, why did you do that?EVAN SCHRAGE, RECORDED MSU PROFESSOR'S RANT: Well, Bill, I did it because I really honestly couldn't believe what was happening at first. This man was using his position as a professor to, in my opinion, indoctrinate students into thinking a way that was pleasing to him. I didn't feel any college student should listen to that.O'REILLY: The class that you are in, literatures, cultures, identies. It is an arts and humanities class. That has nothing to do with politics. How did he segue into that rant?SCHRAGE: Well, he was all over the place, talking about a number of things. In the full video you can get a clear glimpse of that. He started talking about the Romneys and the Republican party on a few things and somehow he said he could tie it altogether but still to this day I can't understand.O'REILLY: I don't know what it does with literatures, cultures, and identies. About 400 kids, that's a mob. What was the general reaction now that the professor was taken out of the classroom? He is still getting paid, but he will do research, probably on the Republican party. What was the reaction to the students in the class?SCHRAGE: Well, at the time they were all laughing at his jokes and whatnot. Once I think it started to break out, it has been mixed. I was in the class today before they announced Dr. Penn was no longer teaching the class and people were -- parents were calling them and they were really interested in what was going on. The opinions were mixed. Some felt it didn't -- maybe it was too much. Like I said, a lot of others were --O'REILLY: Anybody mad at you?SCHRAGE: Nobody knows it was me.O'REILLY: Good. So, nobody is directing anger at you.SCHRAGE: Not yet.O'REILLY: Michigan State University paid for by the taxpayers of Michigan. Is it a left-wing school? Is there a lot of stuff like this going on in your experience?SCHRAGE: I just started my sophomore year, so I have only been here one complete year, and it is unfortunate this had to happen so early in my second year. I have had to write a couple of papers with a left-leaning bias because I knew I i wasn't going to get a better grade -- I was president going to get a better grade if I --O'REILLY: You faked the paper to get a good grade. Evan.You now -- was there ever the vice-versa where you had to write a paper from a right wing point of view to get a good grade?SCHRAGE: That has not happened yet, no.O'REILLY: Has not happened yet. And I know a lot of students do that. They take the temperature -- they take the political temperature of the professor and shoot off propaganda to him or her. But the prevailing wisdom on the campus in your experience now as a sophomore, is it left wing or is this guy, Penn, an exception?SCHRAGE: I certainly wouldn't call it an exception. Like I said, I had to write a few papers for professors where this would happen. Certainly he is the most vocal about his opinions I faced. Overall I would say that this is is -- it is a college campus and it is pretty liberal.O'REILLY: Evan, thanks very much.

Decisions must be made, plans must be laid, strategy must be carried out.""The Convention's keynote speaker, meanwhile, said -- ""The Republican Party...had no program, in the dangerous years preceding Pearl Harbor, to prevent war or to meet it if it came.""Extra-Court ActivitiesAs conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia takes heat for his involvements outside of court, the LA Times reports that liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has maintained strong ties to a women's rights organization that often argues cases before the court.The National Organization of Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund co-sponsors the Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Distinguished Lecture Series on Women and the Law, where Justice Ginsburg spoke two weeks after siding with the legal defense fund's brief in a medical case.Federal judicial guidelines instruct judges to avoid pursuing activities where -- ""impartiality might reasonably be questioned.""Praising AbbasPalestinian Leader Yasser Arafat is praising convicted Palestinian terrorist Abu Abbas, who died this week in American custody in Iraq. Abbas headed the Palestinian Liberation Front and masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship in which wheelchair bound American tourist Leon Klinghoffer was shot and thrown overboard. Arafat called Abbas a martyr and a -- ""distinguished fighter and a national leader who devoted his life to serve his own people and his homeland.""Stay out, America...Landowners in a small German town have written President Bush asking the United States to stay off their property. They're worried that the president's recent pledge to build a lunar space station will bring unwanted visitors to their 700,000 square meter estates on the moon.Twelve hundred town residents paid about $20 three years ago to buy the extra terrestrial land from an American businessman, who claimed that a loophole in the UN Outer Space Treaty gave him legal ownership of the moon. Now, many are now warning President Bush that they -- ""don't want landing flags or rusting vehicles dumped on their land.""-- FOX News' Michael Levine contributed to this report"

Carter told the Council on Foreign Relations that he promised Pakistan, Egypt and Cuba that ""the United States was not going to dominate all the other nations of the world in the Human Rights council."" The former president says he called Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to complain that the U.S. insistence on keeping rights abusers off the panel ""subverted"" his promise. Carter now says, ""My hope is that when the vote is taken, the other members will outvote the United States.""Panel ProtestTwo Jewish members of an Illinois panel on hate crime have resigned, saying they won't serve alongside Claudette Marie Johnson, the minister of protocol for Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam. Johnson, also known as Sister Claudette Marie Muhammad, refused to criticize or distance herself from Farrakhan's comments at a Chicago rally last weekend, where he accused ""Hollywood Jews"" of promoting homosexuality and other filth, and blamed ""Zionists"" for manipulating President Bush into war.The two commissioners called the remarks ""incredibly insulting and racist"" and said the panel will carry a ""stain of bigotry"" until Johnson repudiates them.Signing for DollarsThe ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee is offering signed copies of a minority report by the committee in exchange for a $60 donation to his re-election campaign. On his personal blog, Michigan's John Conyers tells people the contribution will reserve an autographed copy of ""The Constitution in Crisis"" -- which relies on the controversial Downing Street memo to accuse the president of ""misleading"" the country into the war in Iraq.Conyers tells potential buyers that the money he receives will help return the House to the Democrats giving him, ""the power to subpoena Bush administration officials to answer questions and face the consequences for their abuses of power.""Cheap VotesThe Mayor of Appalachia, Virginia, and 13 other residents have been indicted on charges of fixing the 2004 election using bribes of liquor, cigarettes... and pork rinds. A grand jury handed down 917 felony counts against the mayor, a town councilman, and a police captain, who is also accused of taking residents' property and seizing drugs for personal use.Officials discovered the plot when one local woman complained to election officials that she'd been offered pork rinds in exchange for her vote outside the polling place. The pork product has become fodder for local jokes, but the prosecutor discouraged people from making light of the bribes no matter what form they took, saying, ""This is not about the pork rinds. It was never about the pork rinds.""-- FOX News' Aaron Bruns contributed to this report."

People across the spectrum point to one case or another as proof positive of what John Roberts believes and how he would rule.But the evidence is all over the map. And to help us find our way is David Leitch, former deputy White House counsel who worked with Roberts, both at firm of Hogan & Hartson and at the Justice Department in the early 1990s. He joins us from Detroit.David, thanks for joining us.DAVID LEITCH, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY COUNSEL: Glad to be here.ANGLE: Let me ask you first, Roberts' career is filled with interesting work on a broad range of cases. Some people will look at one case or another and say, ""That is a clear indication of what he believes."" Why shouldn't that be the case?LEITCH: Well, throughout John Roberts' career, like most lawyers, he represented clients. And clients brought him cases that were all over the map politically and in terms of the jurisprudence that they presented. And John was engaged in the practice of law and representing clients' interests.So it's a little difficult to tell from cases that one has in private practice what one's personal beliefs are. In fact, if you look at the cases that Judge Roberts handled in private practice, they would be hard -- you would be hard-pressed to draw a conclusion from them, because they were, on various sides of many issues, as his client's interests demanded.ANGLE: Now, most of the criticism has been from those who fear that he might be too conservative. But there is some information, some evidence that goes the other way. And there, there's a lot of talk now about a case from Colorado involving gay discrimination.What was that case? And what was John Roberts' role in it?LEITCH: Well, the case involved a statute that Colorado had passed that some viewed as discriminating against gays, and it was challenged and ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court.Judge Roberts' role, when he was in private practice, was a role that he had played hundreds of times in other cases, and that was namely to engage very briefly, in a moot court exercise, to help the advocate who was going to be standing in front of the Supreme Court argue a case...ANGLE: Now, this was pro bono work, right? This was work he was doing for free just to help out?LEITCH: Yes. And I think he spent about 6 1/2 hours on this particular case. And in private practice, in a law firm, it's in the best tradition of the bar; it's in the best tradition of being a law partner, to assist those who are arguing cases in the Supreme Court, if you're an expert in that.And John was asked to do that hundreds of time and he never said no. He always was willing to help. And it also really was a service to the Supreme Court, because it increased the quality of advocacy before the court.And everyone who has practiced in the court has seen cases that could use that kind of help. And it's been an important development over the years that attorneys in the practice before the Supreme Court have come to help others.John assisted the National Association of Attorneys General and other groups who wanted to increase the quality of advocacy in the court. And so this was just part of that kind of effort. I think it's in the best interests of the bar, and I think he should be commended for having spent so much of his time on these types of efforts.ANGLE: Now, that gay discrimination case is causing a little bit of angst on the right. Why shouldn't people have some doubts about his involvement in that case, if this is a big issue for them?LEITCH: Well, I think, because Judge Roberts made it a practice to help all comers and really to help them in the quality of their advocacy, and it was not a choice that he made in the sense that he was out there crusading for one case or another.ANGLE: OK.LEITCH: He was a professional who was trying to assist people in their professional activity in front of the court. And as I said, he did this hundreds of time and I don't think ever said no to anyone who came and asked them for this kind of brief assistance. He spent about 6 1/2 hours on the case and really ought to be commended for it.ANGLE: Now, on the other side, abortion rights organizations are pretty sure they know where he stands on abortion, though others say it's not at all clear. They point to a case dealing with Operation Rescue, which tries to prevent people from going into abortion clinics, on behalf of the first Bush administration that he filed an amicus, or friend of the court brief on that. Let's hear what one of the groups has to say about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NANCY KEENAN, NARAL PRESIDENT: He wrote an amicus in Bray that defended Operation Rescue. And we find that of grave concern when you have somebody that didn't have to file that amicus, but did in defending Operation Rescue, which really are domestic terrorists.(END VIDEO CLIP)ANGLE: OK, so the view there is that he sided with domestic terrorists when he didn't have to. What's your view of that case?LEITCH: Well, again, that was a case in which Judge Roberts had a client. His client was the United States. And the position of the United States through the Bush administration was the one that was stated in the brief. He was working on behalf of the Bush administration.And I think it's a little much to say he was siding with domestic terrorists. There were significant legal issues in the case that was near the line of First Amendment activity. And it was very important that that be clarified. The Bush administration took a position that John helped articulate, along with other lawyers in the Justice Department.ANGLE: The question was how you regulate First Amendment rights without infringing on them, I gather?LEITCH: That's right. And you may recall that this was quite an unsettled question at the time that Operation Rescue and others were engaged in some activities that seemed to be over the line, but some activities that were closer to the line that judges had prevented them from doing.And, you know, we all want to protect First Amendment rights without having them become too extreme. And that was a case that helped to define the territory there. And again, Judge Roberts was representing the interests of the client, the United States, and the position of the Bush administration. I'm sure he did so admirably.ANGLE: OK, David Leitch, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate it.LEITCH: Thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2005 Fox News Network, L.L.C.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. REP. RON PAUL, R-TX, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We may do quite well on Saturday. I have no idea, exactly. I don't mak e predictions. But it's significant. It's significant for me personally. It's significant for our campaign. It's significant for the cause of liberty. MITT ROMNEY, R - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the people of Iowa are far less concerned with the process of politics and far more concerned about the future of America.TIM PAWLENTY, R - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What we need in this late hour at a time when our country is sinking, when our country is drowning, is strong leaders who are going to roll up their sleeves and put their shoulders back and their head down and drive this thing to conclusion.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Some of the candidates here in Iowa ahead of the big debates. And there is a new poll out, Fox News poll. You see Romney -- this is a national poll obviously, Governor Perry at 13 percent, Sarah Palin, who is obviously not in yet, eight percent. There you see a write-in for Mike Huckabee at three percent, and Tim Pawlenty at two percent and how the poll stacks up there.Let's get some thoughts from some people who cover Iowa every day and what they think about this week's events and what is happening here. Joining me now here in Ames, Kathie Obradovich, political columnist for The Des Moines Register, Dave Price, political reporter for WHO-TV here -- in Des Moines rather, and Kay Henderson, news director for Radio Iowa. Thanks so much for being here.You know, as you see these candidates out and about, let's start with you. Do you think -- give us a sense of what the feeling is ahead of the debate, how important is it for these candidates, and who stands to gain the most.KATHIE OBRADOVICH, ""DES MOINES REGISTER"": This debate is really important for candidates and not just because the straw poll follows it. There's kind of two dynamics. One, you have a national debate with a national field of candidates. And then there's sort of a mini debate going on with the candidates who really need to do well in the straw poll. So, you know, I think that people are going to be using this debate to try to advance different campaign purposes. And it'll be interesting to see how that dynamic plays out.BAIER: Dave, ya know with all the turmoil in the markets, the focus on the economy, you know, how does that play here? How important is all of that? Obviously it's important across the country, but here in Iowa?DAVE PRICE, WHO-TV: Right. And that is what they are talking about now. It doesn't matter who you go see, Bachmann, Santorum, Paul, Pawlenty, anybody, they talk about the economy from start to the finish so they know that's the biggest thing out there right now.BAIER: But Kay, social issues seem to play high in Iowa. If you were to stack the importance, can you do it?KAY HENDERSON, RADIO IOWA: Well, I think the economy has eclipsed social issues right now to the extent that you have outside groups from Washington, D.C. who have actually bussed into the state to go around and encourage Iowans to sort of rev up the talk about social issues. And frankly, people who care most about social issues already know where the candidates stand on those issues.BAIER: Organizationally, Kay, do you see a campaign that's standing out in your mind here in Iowa?HENDERSON: Well, of course, Governor Pawlenty has amassed I think, the most talented campaign crew on the ground here. The Bachmann folks started in June. And they have gone out of the gates very hard. They are campaigning hard here.But I would point to Ron Paul. The man who is running Ron Paul's campaign managed the campaign of Pat Robertson in 1987 who won this straw poll not far from where we are sitting today.BAIER: Ya know people at home, Dave, don't really have a full appreciation of a straw poll number one. And what it means here in Iowa, number two. I mean, for somebody sitting on the couch, who maybe doesn't follow politics all the time, what do you say to them?PRICE: There is, to put it in perspective, there are three million people in this state. And only probably somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 people will be here Saturday and actually vote. So you can see how much attention those 10,000 to 15,000 people get. It's a huge deal. But you are talking about a microcosm of the population that will have a big say in who survives past Saturday.BAIER: Because Kathie, that is kind of what the caucuses are as well, a microcosm, because it's not the whole state that comes out in the caucuses, but more obviously than the straw poll. But it is very organizationally-based.OBRADOVICH: Exactly. We consider this to be sort of like a dry run for the caucuses. The caucuses test campaign's ability to get people out in the middle of the winter to spend two hours at a community meeting. While the straw poll is an even bigger lift than that because people have to come from all over the state. There is a $30 admission charge to vote in the straw poll. So you really have the opportunity for the campaigns to really show what they've got. And that is one of the reasons why you get so much attention at this stage of the game.BAIER: Do agree with Kay, about the organization, how it's setting up?OBRADOVICH: I do. I mean the three that she mentioned, Bachmann, Pawlenty, and Paul, I would say those would be in my top three picks to finish in the straw poll.BAIER: And for folks here when they get through this week and you start heading towards the caucuses, are they cocky about how much attention they get from presidential candidates?(LAUGHTER)OBRADOVICH: I don't know about cocky, but I think that they do expect it. I mean they have come to expect it. And when they don't get it, they get kind of miffed.BAIER: Dave?PRICE: I think it's -- I don't think people would be cocky about it either. But there is that expectation. And when you talk to people who go to an event, they definitely expect the chance to reach out and shake the candidate's hand first, but then secondly to actually talk and ask them a question. And they'll go away mad if they didn't get that chance.BAIER: Which is unique. Ya know Iowa, New Hampshire, that's pretty much it.HENDERSON: I think the unique thing about this is that while people focus on how Iowans view this process, this is a process that really is a crucible test for the candidates. And it really helps them hone their message. When you are giving the same speech eight, 10 times a day, it really makes you a better messenger of your own campaign if you have to do that on a regular basis.BAIER: That's right. Kay, Dave, Kathie, thanks so much. We're going to keep them around for ""Special Report"" online. We're going to ask them questions, so make sure you log in.That's it for this panel, but stay tuned for some final thoughts from Iowa.Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC.
