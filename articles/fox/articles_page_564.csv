1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/11/02/mike-pence-clinton-actions-corrupt/	Mike Pence: Clinton's actions corrupt	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" November 1, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us. I'm Bill O'Reilly in the ""Impact"" segment tonight. Let's bring in Governor Mike Pence who is running with Donald Trump on the Republican ticket as everybody knows. He joins us from Pennsylvania.So, Governor, you guys caught a break with this Hillary Clinton email stuff, do you think it's enough to hand you the election a week from tonight?PENCE: Well, you know, long before that announcement last Friday, Bill, I mean, frankly polls around the country were showing tremendous momentum in this campaign. And frankly I saw it as I was traveling across the country campaigning for Donald Trump and with Donald Trump. The crowds, the enthusiasm, this is really a movement of the American people to make America great again.O'REILLY: What about the so-called October surprise. I mean nobody expected FBI Director Comey to come out Friday and say we have to reopen this because Huma Abedin's computer may contain national security stuff that shouldn't be on there. So, I mean, that's what I'm trying to get into perspective here whether that's enough to put you guys over the top. In your opinion, is it?PENCE: Well, I think that's in the hands of the American people. But the simple fact is that millions of Americans, Bill, were very troubled this summer when the FBI concluded that Hillary Clinton had been, in their words, extremely careless with classified information on a private server when she was secretary of state and, yet, they didn't recommend to continue the investigation or charges. We think it was ripe and we commend the director of the FBI for keeping his word to the Congress and the American people.We found new pertinent information. They are initiating investigation. But what we already knew about Hillary Clinton's years as secretary of state where she had a private foundation that took foreign contributions and has come out in this avalanche of emails, I truly do believe convinces millions of Americans that Hillary Clinton should never be elected president of the United States. At the end of the day, I want to tell you there was tremendous momentum in this campaign --O'REILLY: All right.PENCE: -- even before this latest announcement and we are seeing it across Pennsylvania and everywhere we go.O'REILLY: Were you down by 11 in Pennsylvania according to the Franklin Marshall poll but we will get to that in a moment. I want to stay on Hillary Clinton here. Do you think that she is a corrupt person?PENCE: Well, I don't think there is any question that over the last 30 years, the Clintons' careers have been characterized.O'REILLY: No, but her? Hillary Clinton, is she corrupt?PENCE: Well, I think there's been outright corruption represented throughout their careers, Bill. Good heavens! You have Bob Woodward famously of --O'REILLY: You're saying, yes. You're saying yes, you think she's a corrupt person.PENCE: Well, Bob Woodward, Woodward and Bernstein said on this network about a week ago that having a private foundation taking foreign contributions from foreign governments while she was secretary of state, he said that's not unseemly, he said, quote, ""it's corrupt.""O'REILLY: But that's Bob Woodward saying it's corrupt. I want to know what Mike Pence says. Is Hillary Clinton corrupt?PENCE: I think her actions as secretary of state, the pay-to-play politics where you saw Hillary Clinton and aides to Hillary Clinton actually directing contracts for the reconstruction of Haiti to friends of the Clintons who were contributors to their campaigns and their private foundation, that's just -- that's the kind of pay-to-play corruption the American people are tired of in Washington, D.C. And going to come to the end the day Donald Trump becomes president.O'REILLY: I think Americans want to know if you think she is corrupt and you have said now that you do. Is Loretta Lynch the Attorney General of the United States corrupt? She does not want to investigate the Clinton Foundation. You just pointed to it. She does not want, according to reportage by the ""Wall Street Journal"" to investigate at all. Is Loretta Lynch corrupt?PENCE: Well, I don't think we really know. I know that the meeting between former President Clinton and the Attorney General on the tarmac on a private aircraft that was -- that would have been a clandestine meeting but for some industrious local television reporter who saw there it happened this summer was deeply troubling to millions of Americans.O'REILLY: Have you haven't decided whether you think she is corrupt or not?PENCE: No. I don't think we have the facts. At the end of the day.O'REILLY: It's not enough that she doesn't want to investigate the Clinton Foundation? It's not enough?PENCE: Well, Bill, look, I don't want to presume on what her opinions are on that or not.O'REILLY: All right.PENCE: I have seen press reports and suggestions. But at the end of the day, Hillary Clinton is on the ballot, Donald Trump is on the ballot. The American people and Donald Trump have a choice in a candidate who's got an ethics reform proposal. We're going to move in the first 100 days that's going to drain the swamp. We're going to have government as good as our people. We're going to pass fundamental ethics reform in our nation's capital and change the direction of Washington, D.C.O'REILLY: Okay. You are down by 11 as I mentioned in Franklin Marshall poll in Pennsylvania. You need Pennsylvania or Wisconsin one of those two, to pick off to win the electoral vote. We just analyzed it earlier on The Factor. Eleven, that's a big number, being down in Pennsylvania right now.PENCE: Well, I will tell you what, you know, the only poll that matters is the one that's going to be finished on Election Day. And people are going to go to vote here in Pennsylvania on November the 8th. And I just have to tell you, campaigning with Donald Trump here in the Keystone State, he is in Wisconsin tonight, Bill, really and truly, the enthusiasm that we see from not just Republicans but Independents and many Democrats around the country is like nothing I have seen in my lifetime since the days of Ronald Reagan. The American people know we can be stronger, we can be more prosperous but we have got to have new leadership and that happens to be Donald Trump when he becomes president.O'REILLY: There is no question. There is no question the enthusiasm level from the folks attending the rallies is much higher on your ticket than it is on the Democratic ticket. We appreciate your time, Governor, we know you are running around like crazy. It's very nice of you. I hope we can talk again before the vote. Thanks, again.PENCE: Yes.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Thanks for staying you with us. I'm Bill O'Reilly reporting tonight from Southern California. In the ""Personal Story"" segment. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have been questioned very aggressively about their stands on illegal immigration. Tonight we'll talk about with Mr. Rubio.In 2010, he said that illegal aliens in America should be sent back home. Before they can apply for legal citizenship. However, in 2013, Senator Rubio supported legislation that would not have sent aliens home. Did not pass, but he supported it.He joins us now from Iowa. Now, this isn't a got you segment, Senator. I want you to know that right off the bat. I have changed my mind on a lot of issues myself. All right? Did you, indeed, change your mind about the illegal aliens going home before they applied for citizenship?SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, first, Bill, that's never been my position. What I said is we are not going to grant blanket amnesty. And in truth, when I got to the Senate, I saw this major issue that's been confronting our country for 30 years and I said, let's see if we can do something about it and try to fix it in a way that's good for America. And in the process what we have seen now is after two unconstitutional executive orders, a migratory crisis with minors, a problem that keeps getting worse. The American people are not going to support a comprehensive approach to this. You are going to have to do it one step at a time. And that begins with making sure that we can prove to people that illegal immigration is under control and until you do that, you are not going to be able to do anything else. You're not going to be able to do --O'REILLY: I agree.RUBIO: -- it in the way that it was attempted to do in the past.O'REILLY: I agree. But I want to get this on the record. So, you are going to tell me here tonight that your position has been consistent from 2010 up until we're talking tonight. You have not had any change of opinion on this issue?RUBIO: Well, first of all there is a change in approach. Never on position. I never felt and I still do not support amnesty. The idea that we are going to go out handing out citizenship --O'REILLY: No. But you wanted to send them back. You wanted to send them back and then you supported a law that would not have?RUBIO: No, no, no, no. Bill, what I said was that I was not in support of blanket amnesty and in fact I had not supported previous efforts to do it that way, either. And I don't support that effort now to do it that way.O'REILLY: All right.RUBIO: There has to be a process. We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people. I have always said that we are also not going to grant blanket amnesty. So, we have to deal with the problem with the people we have here now. And by the way, Bill, the American people know this. It's just, they're not --O'REILLY: I think so too.RUBIO: And I don't blame them. Until we deal with illegal immigration first.O'REILLY: Let's move the policy forward. And this is a series of short questions and if you can answer them, you know, right directly we can get more in. The wall, all right? Trump wants the wall. He is going to build it. Mexico is going to pay for it all that stuff. You are president of the United States. You build a better wall to keep out narcotics and illegal people from coming in here.RUBIO: Yes. We need 700 miles of fencing and walls. Particularly walls in key sectors of the border and all the experts acknowledge that that law requires it, Congress hasn't funded it. When I'm president they will.O'REILLY: OK. The people that are here, probably around 12 million people, all right? Do you give them working papers? Do you give them the right to work while you're processing who they are?RUBIO: Well, first of all we don't do anything until not just the wall but e-verify, entry/exit tracking system and 20,000 new border agents are hired and it's working. Until all of that is in place and working, we don't do a thing. Then we will see what the American people support. What I have suggested in the past is people that have been here a long time, that people that can pass a background check. Because if you can't, you can't stay. Pay a huge fine, start paying taxes they get a work permit. And that's all they should have for at least 10 years before they can even apply for a green card not awarded a green card apply for.O'REILLY: OK. So, you would consider --RUBIO: That's my suggestion. Yes.O'REILLY: OK. All right. So, I assume if you are president you will sign executive -- OK. I assume if you are president you will sign executive orders to get that wall built fast, to hire the agents you need, to get the e-verify up and running with strict penalties for employers who violate our immigration law. Now, sanctuary cities. You have got them in Florida in your home state. San Francisco is the most well-known. You cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities --RUBIO: Remove the federal funding. Absolutely. Absolutely.O'REILLY: All right.RUBIO: Federal law enforcement funding is cut off. Absolutely.O'REILLY: OK. All right. Kate's law. All right. We are having a hard time getting that passed. You know the struggle that I'm involved with. And part of it is the Republican Party. They won't stand alone vote it, they keep attaching it to legislation they know is not going to pass like the sanctuary city bill. They know that. How do you get Kate's law on the books?RUBIO: Well, I would ask Congress to pass it stand alone immediately and as soon as it reaches the Oval Office, I would sign it immediately. And as you know I'm a co-sponsor of that law. I think we should pass it as soon as possible.O'REILLY: All right. Because that would stop the madness about convicted foreign alien felons defying deportation. Do you and this is just a personal question. No politics just me and you, guys, all right? Are you ready to be guys with me and you? Are you ready?RUBIO: Sure.O'REILLY: Can you believe that not every single politician in this country would support Kate's law? Can you blanking believe they would oppose that? I'm just stunned.RUBIO: Yes, I know some of them. Well, I know some of them. And their arguments are pathetic. Look, the Democratic Party has reached a point now where they have been taken over by the extreme left. I mean, there are no moderate Democrats left, at least not in national politics. And you have got to be Bernie Sanders to be leading in the polls and Hillary is right there next to him. The Democratic Party has become completely unreasonable and it's not just about immigration. It's about a host of issues.O'REILLY: Right.RUBIO: That's the great untold story of American politics is that the Democratic Party has been hijacked by radical, Left of center movement in this country that is completely outside the mainstream of American thought.O'REILLY: All right. Listen, I'm politics aside, just on a moral basis, you're telling me that if you are an elected official in the United States that you're not going to try to stop felons, aggravated felons who are illegal? You are not going to try to stop that? I mean, it just makes my head blow off.Hey, Senator, we always appreciate your time.(CROSSTALK)Thank you very much.RUBIO: Yes.O'REILLY: OK.RUBIO: Thanks, Bill.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

6	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/02/01/bill-oreilly-iowa-dilemma/	Bill O'Reilly: The Iowa dilemma 	"This coming Monday, we will have a more vivid picture of the republican presidential contest.Earlier this week, we reported about a third of Iowa caucus voters could change their minds before they cast their ballots. Right now, Donald Trump remains the front runner according to the Real Clear Politics Average, followed by Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Ben Carson. All the rest of the candidates have no chance in Iowa.Now, it's impossible to predict how the Iowa voters will react to Donald Trump not showing up to the debate last night. We simply can't put that into any kind of perspective so we won't even try. Talking Points also cannot predict what will happen on Monday. It's simply too foggy for me.On another front, the candidate Rick Santorum is saying that ""I, your humble correspondent, am trying to influence the Iowa vote.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICK SANTORUM, FORMER SENATOR: Sort of an outreach for the people of Iowa that you have a media that tries to predetermine the race before the people of Iowa vote. And the reality is that, you know, Bill O'Reilly is playing right now.You're looking at a guy who has announced on the last week of May and have not been invited back on ""Fox & Friends"", have never had an interview with Megyn Kelly, have never had an interview with Bill O'Reilly.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now, I feel Rick Santorum's pain. He's absolutely correct. We have not had him on ""The Factor"". But there's a reason for that. We're not in the campaigning business here. We don't put politicians on the air simply spout their slogans. That's what political ads are for. We cover the news. And when a politician is in the news, they get on the program. That's why Donald Trump gets so much air time. He's dominating the news cycle by injecting controversy into the political arena. And you know what? That's not fair. Other candidates are being left out like Rick Santorum.Honestly, we looked for a reason to put the Senator on, but we couldn't find any. His poll numbers are very low. His campaign strategy is what it was four years ago. There's simply nothing new.Again, Rick Santorum is absolutely correct that the lack of media exposure is hurting his campaign. But it's not anything personal against Rick. I like him. He's smart. He's honest. And you could do worse in electing a president.Again, just to be crystal clear, ""The Factor's"" mandate is to bring you new information and analysis that is independent and honest. And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years. He joined the network in 1996 and is based in New York. Click here for more information on Bill O'Reilly. "
7	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/08/02/will-trump-war-words-hurt-his-quest-for-gop-unity/	Will Trump's war of words hurt his quest for GOP unity?	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" August 2, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, D-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president.  I said so last week, and he keeps on proving it.  I think what's been interesting is the repeated denunciations of his statements by leading Republicans.  There has to come a point at which you say, enough.  And the alternative is that the entire party, the Republican Party, effectively endorses and validates the positions that are being articulated by Mr. Trump.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, HOST ""SPECIAL REPORT"":  President Obama with a lengthy and very forward-leaning attack on Donald Trump today at a press conference at the White House.  The Trump campaign put out a lengthy statement in response to that, but it was the vice presidential nominee who was first on camera to respond.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, R-VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Allowing for the fact that Barack Obama knows a lot about being woefully unprepared to be president of the United States, why don't we look at the record?  Let's look at judgment for a second, OK?  It was Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton who after hard- fought gains in Operation Iraqi Freedom that found Iraq stable in 2008 squandered that, pulled our troops out without a status of forces agreement, created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to conjure itself up.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  But it wasn't just Republicans on Democrats today.  Donald Trump gave an interview to The Washington Post in which he talked about three Republicans, asked if he was going to endorse Paul Ryan, Senator John McCain, talked about Senator Kelly Ayotte.  Here is what he said about Paul Ryan who is up for a primary coming up, the House speaker, ""I like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country.  We need a very strong leadership.  We need very, very strong leadership, and I'm not just -- I'm just not quite there yet.  Ryan's opponent is a big fan of what I'm saying, big fan.""  That, you may remember, mirrors what Ryan said about Trump when asked, at first, if he was endorsing Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now you have a presumptive nominee, Donald Trump.  Will you support him?  REP. PAUL RYAN, R-SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  Well, to be perfectly candid with you, Jake, I'm just not ready to do that at this point.  I'm not there right now.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  OK, so he used those words.  Then here is Donald Trump on John McCain.  ""I've never been there with John McCain because I've always felt that he should have done a much better job for the vets.  He has not done a good job for the vets so I've always had a difficult time with John for that reason because our vets are not being treated properly.  They're not being treated fairly.""  And on Kelly Ayotte, up for reelection in New Hampshire, ""I don't know Kelly Ayotte.  I know she has given me no support, zero support, and yet I'm leading her in the polls.  I'm doing very well in New Hampshire.  We need loyal people in this country.  We need fighters in this country.  We don't need weak people.  We have enough of them.  Are these the people that should be representing us?  OK, you tell me.""  All right, long intro to our panel, Kirsten Powers, USA Today columnist, Mercedes Schlapp, columnist for the Washington Times, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammar.  Mercedes, a lot to digest.  What are your thoughts?MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WASHINGTON TIMES:  Where do you want to start, Bret? Let's just take the first part, which is the fact when President Obama gave a moral speech basically saying, dictating how Republicans should think or act.  It's an insult to Republicans.  They really don't want to hear it from President Obama.  President Obama has decided he is going to try this knock-out punch on Donald Trump.  But with that being said, you know, Trump obviously needs to figure out a way to somehow bring this party together, which is something he said he's going to do, he hasn't been able to do.  And Obama, what he has been able to do is say let's focus on Donald Trump and not on my legacy, on the fact that we've seen a weakened economy, where we've seen failed foreign policy. And the mere fact that the Democrats have successfully changed the narrative so now it's all about Donald Trump and whether he is unfit to be president and not focusing on the fact that you have a record behind President Obama, I think it's a big problem.  BAIER:  Two things there.  One, does it fire up Republicans when the president comes out and does what he did today?  SCHLAPP:  Oh, absolutely.  BAIER:  Two, then stepping on that, does Donald Trump do that by saying he's not going to endorse Paul Ryan in his primary or John McCain in his primary?  SCHLAPP:  I finally have decided that there's two camps.  There's the never-Trump camp and then there is the exhausted Trump camp.  Those Trump individuals who have supported Trump, willing to be on the front lines for Trump, but then at the same time Trump has made these significant mistakes that he needs to clean up.  And they're all saying, these Republicans are very worried that he's not staying on message, which the message is very clear.  Focus on the Obama record.  Focus on the Hillary record and you really have a chance to win.  Otherwise if it's all about Donald Trump, there's no way he can pull a victory in November.  BAIER:  Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  Look, I'm not sure you can call these mistakes.  I think they're a reflection of who he is.  Everybody expected the pivot to being presidential, to being conciliatory, to bringing the party together, and it never comes.  People say mistake after mistake.  At some point you have to ask yourself, is he capable of conducting himself in any other way?  I think you're right, Mercedes, that the basic structure of this campaign is simple.  With any other candidate on the Republican side, this thing would be over given the eight years of record, the failures abroad, the things that Pence raised about what's happening in the Middle East, the news we got on the economy last week, the weakest recovery since 1949.  The list is very long.  And the question that Democrats have to ask, the only way that they can win is to argue for the unfitness of the opponent for the office, because if he crosses the threshold of fitness, he wins.  And that's what the election is all about.  BAIER:  All right, looking at the Real Clear Politics average of all the recent polls, you have Clinton with a bit of a bump after the democratic convention.  She's now at 46.4.  Trump at 42 percent.  Swing state polls seem like they're roughly the same.  Clinton with a little bit of an average as you look at them, the newest ones.  But the favorability ratings in the average, Kirsten, still upside down for both candidates.  I mean, these are unfavorable candidates.  So basically what we're looking at a major negative race over the next 98 days.  KIRSTEN POWERS, COLUMNIST, USA TODAY:  Yes.  And there was another poll that showed, I think, 50 percent of Trump voters saying that their vote a vote against Hillary Clinton.  So I think that -- I want to get to what Charles was saying.  I actually don't think these are mistakes for Trump. I think this is his plan.  BAIER:  His plan?  POWERS:  If he was here, he would say I'm the one who beat everybody when everybody was telling me I shouldn't be saying these things.  And I don't think he's necessarily this erratic person who just does things without any kind of strategy.  It seems that he has been pretty strategic, and he has been given opportunities to back down many times, and he doesn't back down. And it seems to work for him.  That's the thing.  He seems to continue to poll fairly well.  Hillary Clinton got a bump there.  BAIER:  Obviously this Khan story was different than the McCain comments he made in the primary.  Arguably the past two, three days of coverage has not been a great thing for him.  Understanding there's more to the story.  POWERS:  I certainly would agree with that.  But I think there are many times that we have sat at this table and we've talked about things that Trump has done.  And yet he still has managed to bounce back from it, where it looks like maybe he will pay a price for it and he doesn't.  He does seem to have this core base.Now, the question is, how does he expand that out?  How does he expand that out when he needs to try to get independent voters?  But Hillary Clinton also has a similar problem.  She's not beloved, far from it.  She's not trusted.  So, I think, you know, his bigger problem, frankly, is that he doesn't have so many Republicans in the establishment behind him and that he places loyalty so high.  You heard him talking and saying I want loyal people. Well, loyal to what?  Not loyal to Republicans.  Loyal to you.  BAIER:  Yes.  He used the same terminology that Paul Ryan used when hedging on endorsement.  SCHLAPP:  He doesn't play politics the way a normal politician would.  And you would think there would be a book called ""Politics for Dummies"" and somebody could give him a copy of it.  But I has to say, he would be so much stronger in a position where he would be able to bring together the Republican establishment.  Although they're not popular, this election cycle, but you need them, because part of the fact is that they bring out voters.  BAIER:  But Mercedes, we are now on what month where we sat at this table saying this is the presidential pivot.  This is the time when he's getting serious about his presentation.  POWERS:  There is no presidential pivot.  BAIER:  Right.  POWERS:  Right.  BAIER:  So the question is, when you know that Hillary Clinton is playing this card, saying it's a referendum on your stability, your ability to take over this job, then why isn't the campaign saying we should do something different?  SCHLAPP:  If you notice in the Ohio rally these past couple of days, he was able to talk about Hillary and the economy and focus on the foreign policy perspective.  You saw Pence also focusing on these topics.  Part of it is staying on message.  And I think that's the hope that Republicans have with Trump.  Will it happen?  We'll have to see.  We have a long way to go.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
