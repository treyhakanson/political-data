READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.NEW DEBATE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA AND TRUMP CLASH OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, REFUGEE PLANSGina Loudon: If Trump was under criminal investigation and he met with someone on an airplane, the whole world would go crazy. The list goes on; it's absolutely a double standard, I heard even a lot of my democratic friends admit there is a double standard. For some reason conservatives are held to something entirely different than democrats are.Juan Williams: The reality is that history and the media, and the American public knows Trump is the one who talks nasty about Mexicans, and illegal immigrants, and sometimes legal immigrants. He's the one that said we should bar Muslim immigrants, so there is a lot of history that causes attention to everything he has to say about the immigration issue, including his flip flop this past week and saying, ""Maybe I'm not for baring Muslim immigrants.""Mercedes Schlapp: I think there is softness when it comes to immigration in regards to the plans of president Obama as well as Hillary Clinton. The concern is the fact of the vetting process; this is something we have talked about for a long time. Do they have the right documentation coming from the Syrian government, or the Syrian country, to know who is coming into our nation? These refugees are identified by the United Nations. It's not even Americans identifying these refugees.Ric Grenell: That is where the rub is politically here for president Obama because he has deported, and he is trying to play both sides.  I love this story on the political angle because Barack Obama cannot help himself but be candidate Obama, he is a terrible president, he doesn't like governing, he loves campaigning. Let's give him what he is owed here. He is a fantastic campaigner and he wants to run against Donald Trump. He is going to make this about an Obama third term and push Hillary aside.DEMOCRATS ACCUSE GOP OF WASTING TAX PAYER DOLLARS ON BENGHAZI TERROR ATTACK PROBERic Grenell: There's politics in Washington, this is where I think the media has to understand.  The Democrats from the very beginning, from the moment Mitt Romney called out the fact there was not enough action in Benghazi and in Cairo and talking about this as in terrorism. From that moment on the White House and all their Democratic friends in the media jumped on Mitt Romney and the Republicans, saying we were turning Benghazi into a political issue.Mercedes Schlapp: I think when you have a tragedy where you have lost four American lives; I think it's something we really need to understand what the issues were. What is very clear here is the lack of leadership; they were too quick to blame Benghazi on the video, and too slow to react. What do we need to do to ensure that our military is in place to react quickly and respond to these tragedies that are happening abroad?Juan Williams: It's not just the $7 million hearing this is the 7th such hearing, and don't forget there was also a state department inquiry, and if Hillary Clinton were here she would say ""Oh Eric Bolling I testified for 11 hours."" So this is just agnosia for all I'm concerned.Gina Loudon: It should be required that everyone should read the Benghazi report, and it should be that we don't spend more money on things like science denying global warming. How many lives has that saved? If we can learn something from the Benghazi's reports going forward then isn't it worth the Americans lives? By the way Americans did die in Benghazi and nobody died because of Global warming.CLINTON PROMISING 'FREE Wi-Fi' IN TRAIN STATIONS, AIRPORTS & OTHER PUBLIC SPACESGina Loudon: I think it does stop with Hillary Clinton, we know that her plan is so far out of what we can afford in this country. She and Obama have already taken us to doubling our debt, that will not change, and it will be Obama's third term with Hillary, lots of spending and the bottom line is you can go to any corner coffee shop and get free internet.Mercedes Schlapp: Does the free Wi-Fi come with a personal server? Or it doesn't? This is part of the problem; I think she is picking up the Bernie Sanders mantel, which is out of free. Free college, free Wi-Fi, It sounds great on paper.  The millennials will probably love it but we need to be realistic of the fact that this is a part of our $275 billion net tax increase.Juan Williams: It's not competing, basically what she is saying for young people and poor people, she is going to make sure they don't get left behind. That's good for the American Economy, that's good for American business and that's good for educated people that have access to technology and information.Ric Grenell: The fact of the matter is public Wi-Fi systems are very insecure, we need to have technology people making these decisions not politicians. Taking digital technology advice from a woman who couldn't figure out a fax machine is the wrong way to go."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  Well, I was just waiting for the president to respond to Donald Trump`s remark lambasting the president for pushing climate change as one of the dumbest priorities he`s ever heard in politics.  President Obama finally did get that chance to respond today.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION:  Donald Trump, who is the front-runner on the Republican side, said your remarks were ""one of the dumbest statements I have ever heard in politics.""BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Yes.  Well, you know, Mr. Trump should run back a tape recorder on some of the stuff he`s said.  (LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  To Herman Cain, introducing Donald Trump at a big rally on Wednesday, big supporter of Donald Trump.What did you think of the president`s kind of ""away with you"" response?HERMAN CAIN, CEO, THE NEW VOICE:  The president has gone from assuming that the American people are gullible to assuming that the American people are simply stupid.  Donald Trump may say some things that irritate people, but he never assumes that people are stupid or gullible.  That`s the difference between what Donald Trump said and what the president said, Neil, plain and simple.  CAVUTO:  Now, what Trump was criticizing was the president prioritizing climate change this past week, when all this other stuff is going on.  CAIN:  Yes.  CAVUTO:  It was actually last week.And I`m wondering if there is this -- this issue that Trump brought out that revealed a real weakness for the president, because even some Democrats have privately said his timing was off, that is, the president`s timing.  CAIN:  That`s just one of the weaknesses of President Obama that has been revealed.  His other weakness is, he acts as if he is clueless on the fact that this economy is stalled.  He wants people to believe that a 2 percent GDP growth is the new normal.  That doesn`t have to be.  He wants people to believe that we can ignore the spiraling national debt.  So, he is using climate change not only to push a political agenda, but he`s using climate change to divert the attention of the American people, with the help of the media, that climate change is more important than the economy, more important than national security, and a whole list of other important things.  That`s what the president is doing.  So he`s the one that`s not being realistic about the statements that he`s making, because he`s assuming that the American people are stupid.  More and more people are waking up and saying, we are not stupid.  CAVUTO:  But I -- I -- you know, obviously, you want to forgive -- or the president wants to just sort of dismiss some of these statements out of hand.  But, you know, I`m wondering, Herman, as someone who is backing Donald Trump, he has said some things that, you know, raise eyebrows, ""I saw thousands protesting and cheering right after 9/11.""Do you get a sense that Trump overdoes it, that there`s a particle of truth to that, there were people celebrating in various communities after 9/11, but not thousands, and that that penchant for maybe exaggerating is going to come back and bite him?  CAIN:  Well, maybe the number that he quoted was not necessarily accurate, but there have been three sources that have said people were celebrating...  CAVUTO:  No doubt, no doubt.  CAIN:  ... when the...CAVUTO:  No doubt.  CAIN:  ... no doubt, when the -- when the towers...CAVUTO:  But do you think it hurts his case when he assigns a number like that to it and maybe...CAIN:  No, I don`t think so.  CAVUTO:  You don`t?CAIN:  I don`t think so.  And let me...CAVUTO:  Well, clearly, the polls prove it.  Clearly, you know, you`re right.  The polls prove it.  CAIN:  Right.  Exactly.  That`s exactly what I was going to say.  If you look at the latest Quinnipiac poll, it shows Donald Trump at least twice the nearest competitor in the number two position.  CAVUTO:  Yes.  CAIN:  The latest CNN poll, it is not just two times.  It is two times- plus.  So, here`s what I think.CAVUTO:  No, you`re right.  It hasn`t hurt him. It hasn`t hurt him, Herman.  CAIN:  Exactly.  CAVUTO:  All right.  CAIN:  So the American -- here`s what the American people are saying, in my opinion.  They are more concerned about having a leader and a fighter in the White House...CAVUTO:  All right.  CAIN:  ... than they are worried about whether or not somebody exaggerated a number relative to something else.  CAVUTO:  Got you.All right, Herman Cain, thank you very much.
