"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 19, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: So, the election is six or eight months away. No one really knows. And some wonder if talking politics in the workplace is OK. The Wall Street Journal -- owned by our parent company, Super Rich and Amazing People, Inc. -- reports that workplace debates are getting worse. And according to some survey I didn't read because I was preparing for my ""O'Reilly"" segment, a third of firms been a political chat altogether.But, look, when coworkers say don't talk politics, what is they're really saying is don't talk politic if you are a crazy right winger. Remember, it's perfectly acceptable for libs to wear the politics on their sleeves. They pretty much invented the sincerely wordy t-shirt.In fact, the Gutfeld Institute for Made Up Stuff found that a typical liberal owns seven bumper stickers but only half a car.So, when suddenly when conservatives finally join in the conversation, it's whoa, dude, back off!Back in the '90s, when Dana was sill wiping down tables at TCBY, I was editing a health magazine. I was well-liked mainly because I was in great shape. My abs had biceps. My biceps had triceps. My triceps dated Heather Locklear. But the place was super liberal and when folks found out I wasn't, they stared at me like I was a two-headed goat.So, by all means, crack down on political chatter. But if you are only in banning stuff you don't agree with, then you're a wuss and you should probably work at home or at Current TV where you will really be alone.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: So, Dana, I'm trying to think, how do you feel about people talking politics in an office? Is it as bad as people talking about their pets?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, you have to remember --(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Look at that, just doesn't even listen.PERINO: Pets are a safe place. This is actually one of the points I was going to make. You have to remember, I worked at a White House for eight years.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: When we talked --GUTFELD: I never knew!PERINO: We talk politics it was great.(LAUGHTER)KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Thank you.PERINO: I also have a dog and you might not have heard either.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: I think, I was on Twitter today asking people if they have this problem and they said they do. But I think that you need to have a safe place to go, like, hey, how are you kids, how is the weather? Like something about your dog, or something like that, that you don't get yourself in a bad situation, even get fired or demoted.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Not get a raise.GUTFELD: Yes, that's true.PERINO: And I did not work at TCBY.And you can win half a car on ""Wheel of Fortune,"" by the way.GUTFELD: Oh, really, I had no idea. Thanks for that.Bob, what about the people who talk about, say, the events that go on the night before? Is that considered appropriate information?BOBO BECKEL, CO-HOST: Depending what night are you talking about? If you're talking about mine, it would not be appropriate. No.If you talk about the politics, listen, I wouldn't disagree. You want to hear the conversation?GUILFOYLE: No, don't repeat any of it.BECKEL: I'll repeat all of it. It's all right, conservative stuff and Eric is in there. He gets right over the hill.GUTFELD: Do you think so? I don't think we talk politics there.BECKEL: Are you kidding?GUTFELD: No, it all comes out here. We're the opposite of America. We talk about like, you know, regular stuff, because we get it out in the open.PERINO: That's true.GUTFELD: Don't you think?BECKEL: That's probably very true, but we still do talk about -- if you took general political views that take place in the green room and then the people we invite for guests, for example, are all right wingers. I don't think --GUTFELD: And Che Guevara is right winger.BECKEL: And I'm going to have him up.GUTFELD: Yes.Eric, what do you -- do you think it's a problem? You don't talk politics at work. I don't see you talking politics in the office.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: We kind of talk about sports. We talk about what happened last night. What did you do last night, you write more of your -- whatever book you're --BECKEL: Yes.BOLLING: I enjoy my time with my son talking politics, believe it or not. He's 14. All of a sudden, we're talking about what the difference between Republicans and socialists, I mean, Democrats. We do. We talk politics. And believe it or not, kids, they're picking up on it, man.GUTFELD: The great thing, K.G, we never talk about politics when we're at home.GUILFOYLE: Well, today, yes, like when you pretended you want to buy my apartment and go, what does it look like? Send me pictures? Like you didn't know already.BECKEL: Greg told me you have the same apartment.GUILFOYLE: No, we don't. He occupies the tree space outside my window.GUTFELD: It's a fort, I made out of pillows.GUILFOYLE: There you go. I love talk politics at work. I mean, momma, we're getting paid to talk politics. Best thing ever. Only in America, baby.PERINO: Some people do have to worry.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: You can't like -- you don't in the parking lot, you don't want to have, you know, a GOP sticker on there.GUTFELD: I was harassed -- when they found out that I wasn't voting for Clinton in '92, people coming in to my office just to stare at me.BECKEL: Well; they should. The idea that you want to talk about politics, you can't let a minute go by without mentioning something bad about Obama.BOLLING: When we talk, we talk politics. But for the most part, it would be of a kind.GUILFOYLE: Bob, we wanted to talk about what you occupy the majority of our time talking about --Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.Do Candidates' Tax Plans Address Mounting National Debt?Larry Glazer: Well unfortunately, neither plan really deals with the elephant in the room that soaring national debt. And in order to do that, both plans will actually increase the debt. We have to deal with the entitlement issue in this country. Social security, we've got Medicare, Medicaid, that are 50 percent of the budget. So outside of that we have one really key difference that is corporate income tax. Hilary talks about getting companies to pay their share but Donald's plan will do it. Lowering the corporate income tax gets companies to bring $2 billion sitting overseas back to this country to create jobs and get this economy really moving.Ben Stein: No, I don't like it at all. I've been saying that for some time. It's pretty simple if you raise taxes you will bring in more money. This is the formula if you low in taxes you will bring in money has been proved to be faulty over and over again. I'm afraid that even though I'm not a huge fan of Mrs. Clinton to put it mildly, her tax plan is much less better where the deficit is concerned. We just have to raise taxes. Horrible. I don't like paying taxes but we have to raise taxes on the very, very rich. They can afford it. They won't miss a thing.Charlie Gasparino: If you can look at history, Donald Trump has a better plan. Because history shows that over time, when you do keep -- when you lower regulations, when you keep -- when you lower taxes, businesses and I believe in economic growth, brings much more taxes than any government can. Economic growth increases. Now the problem with Donald's plan he does nothing to contain entitlements and, you know, that's the elephant in the room with that. But if you're going to net this thing, you know, this isn't even close. Her plan is horrible. It complicates everything. His plan is a lot simpler and by the way, I trust Donald trump with tax plan with a Paul Ryan led Congress, any day of the week.Julie Roginsky: Both plans are interesting. If you're Donald Trump and a corporation, or you're a really affluent human being Donald Trump's plan it won't graze. Ben Stein will do great. Middle class parent or somebody trying to get into the middle class, In the middle class or trying to get into the middle class, the breaks that she's given, the incentives she's giving in her tax plan.House GOP Task Force Finds ISIS Intelligence Manipulated to Downplay ThreatBen Stein: No. It isn't what taxpayers really deserve. Taxpayers rarely get what they deserve. As a matter of fact, human beings rarely get what they deserve. Unfortunately, it has been a commonplace of military history in the United States and in all other countries for the politicians to get the military to lie for them, exam rate for them. This has been true since the Revolutionary War very true during the Civil War, very, very true during World War I and World War II and true in Vietnam. So unfortunately, while I'm sure it is true that the politicians may exaggerate, this is standard operating procedure. It's unfortunate but not unusual.Julie Roginsky: You point out life is brutal and nasty and short. Thanks for ruining our Saturdays there. Ben is right, Centcom is actually doing this, and it's an inexcusable. Whoever is doing it should be held responsible. No indication it's coming from the white house or the secretary of defense. But nevertheless, Centcom -- if this is happening, awful.Charlie Gasparino: You worried when it's filtered through politics. As Ben made a brilliant point before, weapons of mass destruction, I'm sure Collin Powell when he heard the words weapons of mass destruction, went, I'm paraphrasing went to President Bush at the time and said let's be really sure, are we sure, he cautioned against it still, so -- but the policy guys still wanted to invade Iraq. The one thing I will say is this, is this, you know, are the policy guys doing this as a matter of course where they -- how they usually do it or is the Obama administration like the Nixon administration and/or Johnson where they're filtering every bad thing about ISIS through a purely, purely political framework. Is this worse than it was -- is this comparable to Nixon, Johnson? I don't know. If it is it's bad.Larry Glazer: Ever since Vietnam, the American people have had a very skeptical view of military intelligence, particularly when it looks like it's altered for political gain. And that's what we're seeing here. Look, it doesn't take a genius to turn around and see everywhere you look, there's a globally inspired ISIS event. Whether it's Paris, whether it's Nice, San Bernardino. It's all around us. It's not going so well. We just want transparency and truth. American lives are at stake here, we want to know people are safe including those in the Armed Forces.Poll: 69 Percent of Voters Disagree With Plan to Prosecute Some Climate Change SkepticsCharlie Gasparino: I think if the Democrats really want to do this efficiently -- these are mostly democratic AGs who want to basically prosecute thought. These are -- they should get re-education camps. Copy the Vietnam, Cambodian, Russian models of re-education camps and just change people's minds all at once modes to of doing stupid piecemeal things because it's not efficient enough to prosecute thought that way. They should just go whole hog I bet you if Hillary Clinton's watching, she's going to take this up.Julie Roginsky: Let's be clear. States pass laws, right, dealing with climate change. You may like those laws, you may not like those laws, it's a belief things. When you have corporations, Exxon, I don't know who it is, doctoring evidence, or otherwise breaking no state laws.Ben Stein: It's more than farfetched. It's unconstitutional, a violation of the First Amendment. It's gone way beyond suing corporations over their disclosure documents. There are prominent people in America on the Democratic side saying that climb change skeptics should be put in prison.Larry Glazer: This isn't about climate change. This is about government overreach and steps individuals stepping up and taking responsibility. Governments are always going to do things we don't like. It's for individuals and the media to call them on it, for the people to rise up. It's not the government's job to enforce everything. If the government enforces everything that doesn't satisfy their beliefs, where do you draw the line? Look, are we going to enforce religious, political beliefs? This is what happened with the IRS scandal. That's the problem.Stock PicksLarry Glazer: (GE) GENERAL ELECTRICBen Stein: (SPY) SPDR"	['Paul', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Nixon']	[]

This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" October 10, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight. Just 24 hours after a contentious debate and less than a full day after each side declares victory, there's dramatic new fallout for each campaign as the stakes grow bigger for the third and final showdown of 2016.Welcome to ""The Kelly File"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. Just 29 days from now, Americans will choose their next president. And in just nine days, they will get their final chance to watch the two square off face to face.  Today, both candidates have been hitting the campaign trail and each other hard. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Any of you see that debate last night?(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I'll tell you what. I'm not sure you'll ever see anything like that again.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: So everybody saw the debate last night. So let me tell you. When I said we are going to get a special prosecutor to figure this deal out --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Remember what Michelle Obama had said. To paraphrase her, one of us went low and one of us went high.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I have never been so ashamed of this country as what's gone on with Hillary Clinton. Without the media, Hillary Clinton couldn't be elected dogcatcher. I mean that. It's true. It's true.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In moments, we will speak with Jason Miller, the Trump campaign's senior communications adviser and we'll be joined by Mark McKinnon, political insider and executive producer of The Circus on Showtime.But we begin tonight with our chief political correspondent campaign Carl Cameron reporting tonight from Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Megyn. In the aftermath of last night's debate, House Speaker Paul Ryan today held a conference call with the Republican Congress of the House and told them that for the final month of this campaign, he is not going to talk about Donald Trump and dedicate all of this time and focus on helping House Republicans maintain their seats and the majority. Pretty tough stuff from Paul Ryan.In contrast, Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee said that he's standing by and the RNC is standing by Trump and they will continue to help him with ground game and financing, notwithstanding some misgivings within the RNC with Republicans on Capitol Hill and many around the country. Trump tonight here in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania has not been using his teleprompter. It was a stem winding speech thus far and he went hard again after Hillary Clinton. And the media. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We have to make sure that this election is not stolen from us and is not taken away from us. Without the media, without the media, Hillary Clinton couldn't be elected dogcatcher. I mean that. It's true. It's true.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CAMERON: Trump made a point today of telling Pennsylvanians, they have to keep a close eye on Philadelphia, suggesting there may be some voter fraud there and in the weeks ahead he said, he'll have three, four, five events a day, travel all over the country and he may be limping but at the end of the campaign he thinks he's still going to win -- Megyn.KELLY: Carl, thank you.Wilkes Barre. Every four years we go there. It's like I always forget.  Anyway, apologies. So, one of the most talked about moments of the night did not even happen in the stage but it happened behind the scenes, involving the people who would sit in Donald Trump's box at the debate.  The campaign apparently wanted to put Bill Clinton's alleged sexual assault victims front and center but then the campaign was reportedly overruled by Frank Fahrenkopf, the debate commissions, Republican co-chairman, leading some Trump supporters to suggest this is proof that the system is rigged.Jason Miller is the Trump campaign senior communications adviser, he is with me. Jason, good to see you.JASON MILLER, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS ADVISOR: Megyn, good evening.  KELLY: So, is it true that you guys wanted to sit the four women in the Trump's family box?MILLER: Absolutely. And we should have been allowed to but that was yesterday. And now we're on to the rest of the campaign.  KELLY: Do you feel like you were treated unfairly given that Mark Cuban was allowed to sit in the front row for Hillary at the last debate?MILLER: Look, there have been a lot of issues with this debate commission from the mic incident at the first debate to the incident last night. But despite all of that and despite the pile-on we had with the two moderators against Mr. Trump, so ultimately became three on one during the debate, I thought he still did really well and won the debate.  KELLY: Do you -- there was some rumbling about Trump demanding that Frank Fahrenkopf be removed from the commission, not have anything further to do with these debates. Is that a position you guys are taking?MILLER: I don't know if anything formal, he's been said yet, but we're clearly not happy with some of the way things have been run so far.  KELLY: But he's going to be in Vegas. Trump showing up at that debate in Vegas?MILLER: I'm confident Trump will be there.  KELLY: Okay. You have to ask with Trump. You never know.  MILLER: We are ready to go. I mean, especially as well as he did in the first debate, as great as he did last night, I mean, going into this third debate, Chris Wallace.KELLY: Uh-hm.MILLER: Talking foreign policy.KELLY: Uh-hm.MILLER: The opportunity to prosecute the case on Benghazi, the Russian reset. All of these absolute foreign policy disasters that Hillary has.  This will be a great opportunity for Mr. Trump.  KELLY: One of the things that Trump was saying just there was, we're going to make sure this election is not stolen, why does he think there's a risk -- what is that mean?MILLER: Well, I think what he's talking to is the fact that we have to make sure we turn out our people, we have to make sure we have voter integrity at the polls, we have to make sure that the reporting is fair and it's accurate and we're making sure that we are getting the information to all the people. Being fed false information. And we have to turn out and vote. That's ultimately what it's all about.  KELLY: What do you make of the latest polls that show Trump behind 11 points, behind Hillary Clinton in a four-person race and 14 points behind in a two-person race?  MILLER: I love the fact that NBC seems to navigating it to the business of breaking the news and then also having the polls magically pop up.  KELLY: Now, we all do -- we all both report the news and have polling operations.MILLER: Right.  KELLY: Not unusual.  MILLER: Right. But this poll is an outlier. You look at the ""L.A. Times"" poll which has us ahead by several polls. There are number of other, the Gravis poll by just a couple of --KELLY: But this is the one that was done entirely after the sex tape, the ""Access Hollywood"" tape broke.  MILLER: Yes. But it was before last night's debate and what we've seen for any of the tracking polls that we have seen like ""L.A. Times"" and others that we have been looking at is the fact that it's been holding pretty consistent and I think actually Mr. Trump probably getting a pretty nice bump after last night's debate. I mean, it's a big win for him. We felt very good. I'm not sure what your thoughts are but we thought Hillary look pretty rattled coming out of the debate and so we're pretty excited about the next one, too.  KELLY: What do you make -- earlier Trump said today that if more tapes come out like the one we saw of the ""Access Hollywood"" thing with Billy Bush -- if more tapes come out, he says, he is going to attack the Clintons on women, he will continue to attack Bill and Hillary Clinton. Why would that be when if you take the tape of ""Access Hollywood"" tape, that was an NBC News release, it wasn't -- the Clinton camp didn't have anything to do with that one?MILLER: Well, I think there are a couple of things here. Taking a step back for a moment. Number one, on our side, we were calling out the hypocrisy of Hillary Clinton and her campaign with the constant low road -- you played the clip beforehand of one will take the low road, will take the high road.KELLY: Uh-hm.MILLER: Their campaign is taking the low road this entire campaign. And so --KELLY: She had a lot of choice words for him last night, too. She wasn't entirely up there as she would have us to believe.MILLER: Yes. This was not --KELLY: And on the high road.MILLER: Yes. This was exactly a pillow fight --KELLY: The road had a little -- had some trips down, had some trips back up, it was mostly low.  MILLER: But look, we're going to call it hypocrisy when we see it and we're not going to be shy about it. We're going to stand up, we're going to defend ourselves and we'll be ready to fight back.  KELLY: Let's talk about those -- these four women specifically because there's -- the one woman, three of the women accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault. Allegations that were never proven in a court of law. And then one woman Kathy Shelton was herself a rape victim not of Bill Clinton, a rape victim when she was 12 by some man and Hillary Clinton was his court- appointed legal defender.And the case is plea bargained, he got off with time served in a couple of months. And then she was heard on tape laughing about the case and some aspects of it on tape years later. Why does that speak to Hillary Clinton's character and is it true that Roger Stone and his Super Pac paid Cathy Shelton $2,500 to give her testimonial?MILLER: I've never heard anything about that. We certainly didn't pay --KELLY: Roger Stone says he did.MILLER: I have no knowledge of anything like that. We certainly didn't go and pay anyone to join us yesterday. But this Cathy Shelton case really speaks to Hillary Clinton's character. Cathy Shelton at the age of 12 was horribly raped as a very disturbing --KELLY: An adult male.  MILLER: It's very disturbing case. And Hillary Clinton --KELLY: This is her in the blue just for our audience. Go ahead.MILLER: Hillary Clinton had the option to take this case. She didn't have to go and take this case.  KELLY: That's disputed. She said she was court appointed and the prosecutor in the case agrees with her.  MILLER: I'll disagree on that. She didn't have to take this case. She was able to essentially bring down the charges for the man that brutally raped Cathy Shelton and as you said, there was audio recording where as they were talking about the polygraph tape where Hillary Clinton was chuckling, she --KELLY: We have that. Can we listen to it?MILLER: Yes. Please.  KELLY: Let's listen to it. She's talking about the polygraph and how she no longer believed in it after this case. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Of course, he claimed that he didn't all of this stuff. He took a lie detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faiths in polygraphs. (LAUGHTER)I handed it to Mahlon Gibson and I said, well, this guy's ready to come up from New York to prevent this miscarriage of justice. (LAUGHTER)   (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Now, her defenders say, she is laughing about the absurdities of the system.  MILLER: Sounds pretty clear to me that she is laughing about the fact that she can't believe the results of this polygraph because she definitely knew.KELLY: Why is that not excused by, you know, I've been a lawyer for nine years, you don't always believe in your client. You believe in the role the lawyer plays in the system.  MILLER: I think this really becomes a character issue. This isn't something we'll agree to disagree on this one but this is not a case that she had to take, when you have someone who committed such a brutally horrific act of raping a 12-year-old, I think that really becomes a character issue.  KELLY: Last question.  MILLER: A person wants to be leader of the free world.  KELLY: Donald Trump is out there saying Hillary attacked those women that we have been discussing viciously. That she attacked them viciously. She wasn't the only one. He did, too. And here's a sampling of that, too.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Bill Clinton was the worst abuser of women. Ever to sit in the Oval Office. He was a predator.  Look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant and they tried to impeach him which was nonsense.  If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we'll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things.  I don't necessarily agree with his victims. The victims are terrible.  The whole group, Paula Jones, Lewinski. It is just a really unattractive group.  Bill Clinton sexually assaulted innocent women and Hillary Clinton attacked those women viciously.I think she's been through more than any woman should have to bear.  Everything public.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: It's quite a change in tone by Mr. Trump.  MILLER: Well, I think it's Mr. Trump learned more about these women stories and about what has happened to them, not just from former President Clinton but the bullying, the intimidation that they had received from the Clintons, I think that's informed his opinion a lot.  KELLY: He finds them more attractive now? I mean, why is he out there calling them unattractive?MILLER: Look. I can't speak to previous comments but I can tell you now that he has learned their stories and he realizes particularly in the case of Juanita Broaddrick, the amount of pain that she went through and the courage that she's had to step up and tell her story, it is very compelling case.  KELLY: But Juanita Broaddrick denied that he raped her -- she denied under oath that Bill Clinton raped her and then later she changed her tune. But for 21 years, she said it didn't happen. So, how are the American public supposed to hold Hillary Clinton accountable for believing Juanita Broaddrick the first time in her under oath testimony that it didn't happen?MILLER: Well, I think she was intimidated. I think that now what we are seeing was the courage --KELLY: But she came out -- Juanita came out and told the FBI investigators that she wasn't intimidated, that no one from the White House ever pressured her or intimidated her.MILLER: If you look at the conviction, and the way that she's telling her story, there's no way someone can watch her interview. Breitbart posted an interview the other day of this. There is no way that someone can watch that. I think that she is not telling the truth. I mean, this is a woman who has gone through a lot and why would she be putting herself out there if this wasn't true?KELLY: Jason, great to see you.  MILLER: Thanks, Megyn.  KELLY: My pleasure.  Well, joining me now with more, Mark McKinnon, he is the co-creator and co- host of ""The Circus"" on Showtime. He also served as chief media adviser to President George W. Bush.Mark, good to see you. So, let's take -- start with the women for a second. So, there are some questions about these alleged sexual assault victims and, you know, they never proved their cases. Okay? But Cathy Shelton is a different story. She was raped. Hillary Clinton did defend the man who did it and does sound very callous discussing a case in which she attacked the character of that little girl and beyond, you know, she's got a plea bargain. She attacked the character of that little girl in order to get a better deal for the client and that may be very off putting to people.  MARK MCKINNON, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, ""THE CIRCUS"": Could be, Megyn. And whatever you think of -- on any of these women, the fact is that the Trump campaign and Jason have just very effectively changed the dialogue.KELLY: Uh-hm.MCKINNON: We're no longer talking about the tape and Billy Bush. We're talking about the Clinton women.KELLY: Uh-hm.MCKINNON: In fact, we spent -- you just spent 15 minutes talking about the Clinton women. So the -- by Trump rolling out these women, a half hour before the debate, that was the boldest act of political theater I have ever seen in my life.  KELLY: And this is somebody who knows political theater we're talking to.  MCKINNON: And you know, one of the things I did last night for ""The Circus,"" I interviewed -- I've been in the business for a long time but there are people like Dan Balz, the Washington press corp and others who, you know, have been around longer than I have. Never have they ever seen anything close to this and it just, it was amazing last night just to be in the hall and watch the jaws drop when Donald Trump walked out with all these women. So, they have strategically effectively done what they wanted to do which is change the subject.  KELLY: Uh-hm. And yet, you tell me whether that group of suburban women that Trump needs so much is going to react well to that discussion and it's going to make them want to vote for Donald Trump.  MCKINNON: I think it's highly questionable. I doubt it. But his imperative in the campaign, imperative right now was to stop the bleeding.  They needed to show their supporters, their base that he was still in the game, that he still has the fight and that's exactly what they wanted to see. So that -- he just needed that to get back in the game. Now whether or not he can advance the ball further, we'll see in the next 30 days.  KELLY: What did you think of that tape, Mark? I mean, when you say that tape of Trump on the bus of ""Access Hollywood"" talking about grabbing women between the legs.MCKINNON: I was shocked. I mean, you know, people say that that's locker room talk. I've been a lot of locker room. I've never heard anybody say that. It was the entitlement that you can do anything you want. That's what different, that's the step further. I mean, we say a lot of unpleasant stuff in locker rooms but we don't talk about saying, you know, I'm -- because of who I am, I can do whatever I want to women.KELLY: Uh-hm.MCKINNON: That's where it went over the line and I think that's what having a big impact.  KELLY: I mean, it's good to hear you say that. I mean, I think most women are not in the men's locker room for that kind of talk.  MCKINNON: Well, one of the things I hate about this tape is that a lot of women are now saying, that's what all men said in the locker room because that's what, you know, Trump defenders are saying. That's not true.  KELLY: Right. Right.MCKINNON: It's really not true.KELLY: Right. And, you know, we can only speak for particular the men in our lives, but I can tell you my husband doesn't talk like that and he never has.MCKINNON: Right. Right.KELLY: Mark, great to see you.  MCKINNON: Kick it.  KELLY: Love that. Kick it. I want to be as cool as he is and I never will be. And a reminder that the next and final and probably most important presidential debate is less than ten days away now. It will be moderated by our own Chris Wallace. As you know, he is the anchor of ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY."" He was our co-moderator in the GOP primary debate this election season. He knows the drill. And it will all go down in Las Vegas. Wednesday, October 19th at 9:00. And then stay tuned for a special KELLY FILE live at 11:00 with the complete wrap up and analysis of the night's biggest moments.So, we now have the first poll since the story broke about Trump and the videotape and two of America's most important political number crunchers join us next on what we're seeing and now. Tom Bevan and Larry Sabato.  Double dose of trouble are next.Plus, new worries on Capitol Hill this evening about whether Republicans can hold either the Senate or the House now. Chris Stirewalt and Governor Mike Huckabee are here on what the GOP needs to pull this out.Plus, Robert De Niro's epic rants on Donald Trump. You first saw it right here. Got millions of views after our Friday debut. We are talking about 50 million. And tonight, we have the story of how one conservative Hollywood heavyweight is hitting back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT DE NIRO, ACTOR: He's an idiot, Colin Powell said it best. He is a national disaster. He is an embarrassment to this country. It makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo, has wound up where he has.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Twenty nine days until the election. Nine days until the final debate and 11 points separating Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the latest national poll. Today's ""Wall Street Journal"" survey taken before last night's debate turned heads by showing a bigger than ever gap between the Republicans and Democratic nominees. In a four-way race, it's 46 percent for Mrs. Clinton to Trump's 35 percent. Those numbers helped give her a lead in the Real Clear Politics average of all polls.Joining me now, co-founder and publisher of Real Clear Politics Tom Bevan and the director of UVA Center for Politics Larry Sabato.Great to see you both. Tom, let me start with you on this NBC poll and whether it is an outlier and problematic for any other reasons.  TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER: Well, no. I mean, what any poll will do will give you a snapshot of a moment in time and obviously this poll was taken sort of at the height of the frenzy, right? The tape breaks on Friday. This was taken on Saturday and Sunday pre-debate. So give us a glimpse into that period of time and what it shows is bad news for Donald Trump and bad news for Republicans.I mean, certainly this hurt him and hurt him pretty significantly. We're obviously waiting to see more data coming out in the days to see if he was able to stop the bleeding, recover any sort of ground based on his debate performance Sunday night. But right now, what these poll shows, I don't think it's fair to call it an outlier. It's the only one we've had and just give us a glimpse into that moment of time and it's bad news for Trump.  KELLY: Can you explain, Tom, why we do this two-way matchup versus the four-way match-up when you know, you do have four candidates in the race.  BEVAN: Yes. It's a good question. I mean, I tend to look at the four-way race because that's, we have four candidates.  KELLY: That's reality.  BEVAN: That's reality. That's where it is.  KELLY: Okay.  BEVAN: But we didn't always have four candidates in the race and so I think organizations started out polling the two-party race and added the third and fourth party or third party candidates later on when they entered the race, and they just kept polling the two-party race the entire time.  KELLY: Okay. Even though it's totally irrelevant. Got it. Okay. Larry, let me ask you, you made some big shifts today in your Electoral College map that now gives Hillary Clinton a likely 340 votes in the Electoral College and needs 270 to win. You made seven moves including in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, all seven moves were in Hillary Clinton's favor. Why?LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UVA'S CENTER FOR POLITICS: Well, look at what's happened in the last week or so. Clinton has consolidated her gains. I agree with Tom about when that NBC poll was taken. I think she is ahead about five points, exactly where the polling average has it. I'm obsessed with polling averages not individual polls.  KELLY: Uh-hm. So, you don't believe she's 11 points ahead or 14 points ahead?SABATO: No, no. I think it will come back down to five points, somewhere in that general vicinity and remember, a five-point lead will give you a very substantial Electoral College lead. That's where it is right now. Do I know what's going to happen at that third debate? Do I know what Chris Wallace is going to ask? Do I know what the candidates are going to --KELLY: Do you know what WikiLeaks has? WikiLeaks?SABATO: Do I know what WikiLeaks has? No. They don't share it with me.  KELLY: Right.SABATO: I have no idea what WikiLeaks has.KELLY: Right. I mean, they're all sorts of contingencies.  SABATO: These maps change. You know, because real events matter, particularly at this moment. But Megyn, I am going to have to stress one thing. There aren't that many undecideds. I think Tom will agree with me on that. I am not going to say the cake is baked. I am not going to say the cement is totally set but there aren't that many real undecided to shift back and forth.  KELLY: So, where do we stand now before I let you go? Tom, you know, I have asked you this almost every time you've been on but now where you put the percentages in terms of her likelihood to win versus his and then Larry, I want you to answer the same thing.  BEVAN: Well, as you remember, Trump had gotten, you know, up in the 40 percent, 45 percent range. I think he is backed down now in the 20, 25 percent range. I mean, he is taken steps back over the last couple of weeks and the question is whether he's able to take any more steps forward and whether he has enough time to take more steps forward, given that there's only a couple more pivot points. Again, we don't know what's going to happen but he is now behind the eight ball with just, you know, as you said, 29 days left to go, it's a tough place to be.  KELLY: Larry?SABATO: Last time I told you 65 percent chance Clinton would win. I would increase that to 70 to 75 percent. So, Tom and I are about the same place.  KELLY: Wow! You're in exactly same place. Great to see you both. Thank you, gentlemen.  SABATO: Thank you.  KELLY: So with Hillary Clinton gaining ground in these recent polls, what does it mean for the Republicans' chances to hold the Senate and the House?  Might she be on her way to undivided government? Chris Stirewalt and Governor Mike Huckabee are here next on that.Plus, ""The Kelly File"" shared a world exclusive three days ago when we broadcast a very powerful message from actor Robert De Niro to Donald Trump. With that story now reaching more than 50 million people, another Hollywood heavyweight is challenging De Niro and we've got that story coming up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DE NIRO: I mean, he's so blatantly stupid. He's a punk. He's a dog.  He's a pig.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, in just the last couple of hours, the RNC released a statement saying it is standing behind Donald Trump tonight after a day of drama involving several party leaders. It all started with House Speaker Paul Ryan telling fellow Republicans he will no longer campaign for or defend Donald Trump at all. Instead, the speaker says he is to focus on entirely on keeping Republican control of Congress but he's not withdrawing his endorsement.For months we've heard that Republicans are at risk of losing their majority in the Senate but now there are growing concerns that the GOP may lose control of the House, as well. Governor Mike Huckabee is here on how the Trump campaign's reacting to all of this and we begin with Chris Stirewalt, co-host of the new show, ""Perino and Stirewalt."" I'll tell you what. Chris, great do see you. So, is that real? It would takes 30 net seats, you know, for the Democrats to gain, a net of 30 in the House to retake control there.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: It would take the kind of nuclear behind whipping that the ""Wall Street Journal"" poll hinted at. I don't know whether Donald Trump was really that far behind, double digits behind. But that poll did say that at that moment the generic ballot, when we asked voters, when pollsters ask voters which party would you prefer to be in control of Congress, the Republicans were down 7 doggone points. Now that would be the area where you start to look at the House even though the Republican majority looks quite sturdy.KELLY: And is that what led Paul Ryan to come out today because what we're told is that the chairman of the house GOP campaign arm, who'd been briefed on the situation, he warned the lawmakers that the, ""ground is shifting"" and the next thing we knew, Paul Ryan were gathering everybody saying I have a message. Save yourselves!STIREWALT: Run, run for your lives. I sort of picture Paul Ryan, he throws the papers up in the air and he says, ah, do what you want. I don't care. I'm out.KELLY: Right.STIREWALT: Look, Paul Ryan has a choice. He is sort of on a keel boat out in the Mississippi and on one bank you've got the severe danger that comes from Donald Trump's populous movement and people that say that they will swipe this election for Republicans in the House and in the Senate if the party does not uniformly back Trump. That's bad. They can cost Republicans key seats.On the other side of the river, over here on these rocks are all of these millions and millions and millions, many more humans of independent voters who say, holy coconut Republican Party, you guys are a mess. So, he's trying to get between these two banks and it ain't easy.KELLY: Right, because it's hell either way. But do you really believe that the Donald Trump supporters would vote Democrat in their congressional elections if these house Republicans just didn't back Donald Trump? They didn't say anything about him but they just failed to back him?STIREWALT: It's not that they would vote Democrat, it's that they wouldn't vote. It's the reverse of what the Never Trump people are threatening to do at the top of the ticket. They say we'll vote for Republicans down ballot but we're not going to vote for Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. This is the Trump populous saying, oh yeah, conservatives? How about this? We're going to vote for Donald Trump at the top and then we're going to skip your people going down ballot.So this is the kind of suicide -- this is a death pact that the Republican Party is entering into. Meantime, Ryan is keenly aware of these other voters who are out there that basically being ignored and neglected. These are the swing voters. These are the suburban voters who decide every election. They're looking on to this death match that's taking place and they're saying, what is going on?KELLY: We got unhappy humans on the Trump side. We got unhappy humans on the Never Trump side. And you've got very happy humans on the Hillary side watching all of this, like they said Jen Palmieri, her communications director yesterday was actually having a beer before the debate like, yeah, hey! Woo! Like the ""Saturday Night Live"" skit but I don't think she was in that same stage at the end of the debate. Chris, great to see you.STIREWALT: You bet.KELLY: So, not only did Donald Trump today hammer Paul Ryan for failing to offer more support. Some of his top surrogates also made sure that the message from the Trump campaign was loud and clear. Here's former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: My only advice to Republican leaders is simple. In the end, you either help defeat Hillary Clinton or help elect Hillary Clinton. I think to sit on your hands, to find some pretense because Donald Trump isn't pure enough so you're willing to have Hillary Clinton get elected is an enormous disservice to the future of the country and the future of our children and grandchildren.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Okay, should have given you a word that that was going to be an extremely close-up. That's like when I talk to my mom, you know, with the lap -- right. Anyway, it's like how come I can't see anything? Mom, look at -- anyway. Joining me with more is Governor Mike Huckabee. He's a former presidential candidate and Fox News contributor.So, governor, great to see you. This is what we've heard from the Trump supporters all along that look, you may not love Donald Trump but he won this thing fair and square and if you don't get behind him and fight to the bitter end, it's going to cause recriminations in the party for years to come.MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: That's exactly right. Let me tell you something. Here's a little secret Megyn, a lot of these bed-wetting, hand wringing Republicans, they're not afraid Donald Trump is going to lose. They're scared to death he's going to win. And if he wins he is going to mess up the neat little package of fun they have because they all play to the donor class and Donald Trump is coming to make big changes in the way that these institutions go.KELLY: OK, but wait. But let me ask you. Let me challenge you there because in their defense, you know, it's not like nothing happened this weekend. Something big happened. They saw that tape. They were horrified by it and they had a real -- now maybe, but many had a real come to Jesus moment of, can I actually look my daughter, my son in the face and say, I in essence endorsed that conduct? Because you know as well as I do this isn't the first time he's made derogatory comments about women.HUCKABEE: That's exactly right. Look. It's not a big surprise that he is crude and he's vulgar. We all knew that. We knew he wasn't a Sunday schoolteacher. I think everybody gets that. And nobody's endorsing what he said. My, gosh, not even his own family is endorsing it. He isn't endorsing it. He ran from it, apologized for it.I'm waiting on Hillary to apologize for lying to Congress, lying to the American people, destroying evidence, getting all of her people off with immunity deals. Making a deal with Iran, selling out to the corporate shills...KELLY: Let me ask you something.HUCKABEE: ...and basically just giving over in her speeches. Megyn that ought to be the talk of the town and it isn't.KELLY: But let me ask you something because you ticked off a bunch of things that Trump mentioned last night and while we've talked about the hit Trump's taken in the polls as a result of that tape and so on, I don't know that sort of a mainstream Republican class or, you know, even sort of these elites if you will, understand how invigorating it was for Trump supporters to see Trump turn to Hillary Clinton and let her have it on some of those issues like emails and trustworthiness and honesty, which we've never seen anybody look right at her and do.HUCKABEE: The one thing you have to say about Trump, that he is fearless. This is a guy that is comfortable enough in his views, whether you like them or not, that he's going to take it straight to the other person, to their face. He's not two faced. He is not a phony. Look. I've said this about him, Megyn. He is like Captain Quint in the original movie ""Jaws."" He's vulgar. He's salty. He might even get drunk. He's just a...KELLY: He doesn't drink.HUCKABEE: But hold on here. He's the guy who's going to save your butt and save your family. And so, at the end of the day, when he kills the shark, you're happy about it. Now, Hillary is the shark. She's going to eat your boat. She's going to have open borders. Immigration out the kazoo and so, the choice is do you vote for Captain Quint who's going to save your family or do you vote for the shark? That's the choice you get to make.KELLY: Now, governor, I hate to be the one to tell you this.HUCKABEE: You're going to...KELLY: But Captain Quint got eaten by the shark on the movie.HUCKABEE: But he died saving the other people. That's what he did.KELLY: But he died and went down in flames and the shark won as between the two of them.HUCKABEE: The shark didn't win. The shark got blown up. Look. Any analogy can fall apart, Megyn.KELLY: After it ate him.HUCKABEE: Work with me on this. Come on. Work with me. This is a good one.KELLY (SINGING): Farewell and adieu to you Spanish ladies, help me out James. Farewell and adieu you ladies of Spain. OK, I got to go. I'm sorry. There are limits to what I should be doing on the air. Great to see you governor.HUCKABEE: Certainly. Thanks. Good to talk to you.KELLY: So, on Friday we premiered a video right here that's now been viewed more than 17 million times online. It's been seen over 50 million people. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT DE NIRO, MOVE ACTOR: He talks how he wants to punch people in the face. Well, I'd like to punch him in the face.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Up next, David Wohl and Krystal Bell join us on the new twist to the Robert De Niro video after another big name in Hollywood decides to push back. Plus the Clinton camp dealing with embarrassing new revelations of WikiLeaks tonight. See which top campaign adviser was just caught saying some unkind things about Chelsea Clinton.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DE NIRO: I mean he is so blatantly stupid. He's a punk. He's a dog. He's a pig. He's a con. A (BLEEP) artist. A mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about, doesn't do his homework, doesn't care. Thinks he's gaming society. Doesn't pay his taxes. He's an idiot. Colin Powell said it best. He's a national disaster. He's an embarrassment to this country. It makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo has wound up where he has.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: So, putting De Niro down as an undecided. No. It was just three days ago that ""The Kelly File"" ran that video message from Robert De Niro for the first time anywhere, and in just 72 hours it has reached some 56 million people. One of those folks just happened to be Jon Voigt, a well- known Hollywood actor and one of the town's most outspoken conservatives who had a message of his own for Mr. De Niro. Trace Gallagher has the story, Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, the 54-second clip of Robert De Niro going after Donald Trump was supposed to be part of a get out the vote campaign video that didn't air his part and didn't make the final cut. As you say, it did, however, make the final cut of ""The Kelly File"" on Friday night. And when it hit ""The Kelly File"" Facebook page, it caught like wild fire -- 17.5 million views, nearly a half million reactions and comments and by the time it was posted, reposted and shared, it reached more than 56 million people. Here's another sample in case you missed it. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DE NIRO: He talks how he wants to punch people in the face. Well, I'd like to punch him in the face. This is somebody that we want for president? I don't think so.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: If you weren't counting earlier, De Niro called Trumpm a dozen names but raging bull got some pushback from midnight cowboy with actor Jon Voight saying, ""he was ashamed of De Niro's comments and that De Niro's rant was more damaging than what Donald Trump said to Billy Bush quoting here, ""I am calling for all Trump supporters to express their outrage and anger against De Niro and all Republican turncoats. Let Donald Trump know we are completely behind him and may God give him the strength to continue his calling.De Niro who's in Dubai promoting his resort both defended his comment and took a swipe at Jon Voight quoting, ""Voight is a nice guy but he is delusional. The Republican Party has rationalized that his guy sis sane, that this guy should be president. It's awful. They will self-destruct."" De Niro says you might not feel you can trust Hillary Clinton but, quote, ""she's a grown-up."" Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thanks. Joining me with more, David Wohl. He's a Trump supporter and attorney out in California in Los Angeles along with Krystal Ball, a Clinton supporter and senior fellow with the New Leaders Council, great to see you both.KRYSTAL BALL, JOURNALIST AND ACTIVIST: Great to see you. Megyn.DAVID WOHL, TRIAL ATTORNEY: Hello.KELLY: So, this got to be personally painful for you, David to see, you know, I'm sure you admire Robert De Niro because I think every man in America does and yet there's a division here. There's a clear division among some of the Hollywood elites.WOHL: Well, you know, the same guy who gives us ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas,"" grabs hi cam corder, goes into his basement and shoots this defamatory, insulting, threatening selfie video basically proving that he has Trump derangement syndrome, Megyn. The Hollywood left can't stand the popularity that Donald Trump has attained over the past six months or so and they can't stand the fact that their candidate is an awful candidate.Now, along comes Jon Voight who I've met a couple of times, Megyn, at dinners in Santa Monica attended heavily by conservatives in Hollywood and believe you me that number is growing. And he is an eloquent, powerful, strong, well thoughtful man.He gave a speech at the end of one of them not long after Andrew Breitbart died who was a friend of his, and he's an amazing guy. He's not over the top. He's not threatening. He just basically says, look, we have our point of view. You have yours. Lay off. Don't insult. Don't threaten. Get out of town.KELLY: Got it. Krystal?BALL: Well Megyn, I'm a little confused because it seems to me like what Robert De Niro is doing here is, you know, shooting from the hip, telling it like it is, speaking from the heart and I thought the Trump people loved that stuff. I don't understand the outcry. But I mean, seriously, his language is so tame in compared to what Trump himself says about Hillary Clinton, about immigrants...KELLY: So what do you think of his argument, Krystal, that you know, all men speak like this? This is what Trump's defenders are saying.BALL: You know, I actually had a Trump defender tell me this today about my own husband. That he promises me that my own husband speaks like this when I'm not around. And I find it so deeply offensive, not only to me personally, but to men across the country. I mean, who are you to say this is what men are doing, every single man in the country? It is not true. Sure, are there men that talk like that? Of course, but to brag about sexual assault, this is something that all men do? I don't think so.KELLY: And to realize (ph) little boys and girls that this is the norm.WOHL: No. You know what, Megyn...(CROSSTALK)BALL: ...that he's going to say like that when he grows up...KELLY: David, I'll give you the final word on it.WOHL: I don't. Megyn, I don't. I certainly don't talk that way but I've heard it in locker rooms, I've heard it at parties, I've heard it in bars. I mean, it's something that takes place...BALL: We're not voting for those people for president!WOHL: He apologized for it. Why don't De Niro get into his basement and shoot an apology video? That would take care of the problem.KELLY: Great debate you guys. Good to see you. Up next, WikiLeaks.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELY: Well, a new WikiLeaks email dump today showing some strange relations within the Clinton camp after one of Bill Clinton's closest friends is showing saying some unkind things about the former president's daughter, Chelsea. Trace Gallagher has the details from our West Coast newsroom, Trace?GALLAGHER: Megyn, the emails from 2011 were allegedly written by Doug Band who at the time was helping run the Clinton Foundation and was serving as a top personal aide to former president Bill Clinton and also has his own global consulting firm called Teneo. Apparently, Chelsea Clinton, who was taking on a bigger role at the Clinton Foundation, was concerned that Doug Band and his employees at Teneo were using her father's name without his consent to drum up business.Well, Doug Band didn't appreciate Chelsea's involvement writing quote, ""she's acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but to create issues to justify what she's doing because she, as she has said, hasn't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life."" Band also made it clear he didn't like the idea of Chelsea Clinton questioning potential conflicts of interest between his consulting firm and the Clinton Foundation saying, ""I don't deserve this from her and deserve a tad more respect or at least a direct dialogue for me to explain these things.""Doug Band even complained that he had to talk a former Clinton Foundation financial officer out of killing herself, ""she called to tell me the stress of all this office crap with WJC -- William Jefferson Clinton and Chelsea Victoria Clinton as well as that of her family had her driven to the edge. The latest WikiLeaks dump also has emails from 2015 showing the Clinton campaign compiled, ""Hits File"" on Bernie Sanders on how to attack his progressive credentials on things like guns, Wall Street and taxes.And still other emails about how Hillary should respond to questions that tried to connect the Clinton Foundation to her actions at the State Department. The Clinton campaign is tying the email leak to Russia saying even Putin knows that Trump had a bad debate. Megyn?KELLY: They were also in a full-on panic that she might have to run against anyone other than Donald Trump. That's who she wanted as her opponent all along. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So as you can see here in this old footage from the film, it did not end well for Captain Quinn. However, even though the shark eventually killed, he came back again and again and again in a different form one shape or another and it remains to be seen what happens in this particular election.
