"Over two centuries ago, our founding fathers were creating the United States of America. Every year we celebrate our nation and its creation on the Fourth of July. On this holiday, we honor our founding fathers by grilling up some good food, making fun red, white, and blue decorations, and spending time with friends and family. So while we eat our burgers and ribs, we look back to the men who created our country and their culinary preferences.Times were much different when our founding fathers lived. They cooked over open wood fires, and often had farms of their own where they got their produce. They didn't have supermarkets and convection ovens. Food was simpler for them, and a lot of the founding fathers had easy-to-please palates. Then again, Thomas Jefferson was known for his culinary adventurousness. Culinary historian Karen Hess described Jefferson as ""our only epicurean president."" He was an avid gardener, and trained his kitchen staff in French cooking techniques.Our nation's founders had a deep love for food, just like us. Washington had his cherries and Benjamin Franklin was a particular fan of turkey. Whether they preferred simple meals or more elaborate dishes, eating was a big part of their lives. After all, they spent a lot of their time navigating politics and drafting important documents. They must have been exhausted after a day full of that. We took a look into what kinds of foods our founding fathers ate."	[]	['creation']
