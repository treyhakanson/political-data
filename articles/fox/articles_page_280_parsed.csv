But, to these guys, it's more than just a fantasy. It's serious politics.So, out of the Democrats just elected to Congress, who would they want on their dream team? And, of the Republicans who lost, who didn't deserve to lose?With us now are the founders of Fantasy Congress, Andrew Lee and Arjun Lall.Guys, welcome to both of you.ANDREW LEE, CO-FOUNDER, FANTASY CONGRESS: Thanks for having us, Neil.ARJUN LALL, CO-FOUNDER, FANTASY CONGRESS: Thanks.CAVUTO: How does this work?LEE: Well, the... I guess I will answer that question.LALL: Sure.LEE: It's just like fantasy football. You draft members of Congress, though, instead of football players. And you earn points based off of how far they -- how far their legislation goes.So, the equivalent of a touchdown is a bill being signed into law.CAVUTO: OK. And -- and -- and, then, Arjun, you kind of look at handicapping it?LALL: Oh, there is no handicaps. Basically, this is based entirely on legislative performance. And we don't want to make this...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: In other words, how much you are able to get done?LALL: Right. Exactly.CAVUTO: OK. So, by that definition, we -- we kind of split it between those you regretted saying goodbye to this week. Leading off that list, Rick Santorum. Why?LALL: Well, basically, you know, Rick Santorum was actually ranked number four on our site, in terms of legislative performance.So, he had been really busy these last two years, you know, passing a lot of legislation, and -- and getting a lot of things done. And we felt that, you know, love him or hate him, he was a very effective, you know, member of Congress, in terms of legislation.And, ranked so high up there, it was kind of, you know, interesting to see him get voted out.CAVUTO: And we should stress, both of you, I think, are largely apolitical on this. You are just judging it on how much they get done, right? By that definition, Andrew...LEE: That's right.CAVUTO: ... Mike DeWine was a loss to you, right?LEE: That's right. Well, Mike DeWine was actually ranked number 11 on -- in -- in the whole Senate. So, he was actually doing quite a lot. He was doing a lot for his state.But the big question for them was, I guess, the -- the national issues were the reason why voters didn't want Mike DeWine. But he would have been a good Fantasy Congress pick.CAVUTO: All right, Congressman Pombo, what's his story?LALL: Well, basically...LEE: Yes, go ahead, Arjun.LALL: Richard -- yes, Richard Pombo, you know, great guy, he is ranked number six in the House. So, he had also been very busy, done a lot of legislation recently. And, so, that was kind of surprising to -- to see what happened there.CAVUTO: Interesting. Guys, I want to switch now to those you are curious to see how they do now.And, Andrew, maybe I will begin with you on Sherrod Brown, the newly elected senator in Ohio. What's that going to...(CROSSTALK)LEE: Well, Sherrod Brown, you know, he has -- he has got some big shoes to fill, especially if you -- you -- you had a draft pick of Mike DeWine. You have to go ahead and see if Sherrod Brown is going to go ahead and increase his performance from the House of Representatives, and be a good Democrat that's going to do a lot of effective legislation in Congress, this upcoming 110th Congress.CAVUTO: And -- and maybe, Arjun, you take this. Bob Casey, a -- a pretty conservative Democrat, who beat Santorum, how do you think that's going to work out?LALL: Yes. I mean, that's -- I'm -- I'm pretty interested to see how that's going to play out, you know, being a Democrat. But he is a lot more moderate. And he may be able to effectively use that to get some bills passed, you know, both on the Democratic or -- or Republican side. And I think, if he -- he plays his cards right, he could definitely be a really effective player over this next two years.CAVUTO: All right, and, James Webb, of course, elected in that squeaker election in Virginia, he is kind of like a rock star now, because he tipped the Senate to the Democrats. Any thoughts, Andrew, on how he will fare out?LEE: Well, Jim Webb is going to be interesting. He has got some other big shoes to fill. Not -- he is not a football player, but he is a - - you know, he is a Navy boxer.The big question for him is, since he's the guy that gives the Democrats power, how much legislation is he going to -- is he going to start pushing, especially in the United States Senate?For us, we are interested in seeing if he is a good sleeper pick, or if he is not going to actually hold up.CAVUTO: All right. Guys, I want to thank you. Very interesting stuff. We will see how the dream team does.LALL: Thank you.CAVUTO: Thank you very much.LEE: Thanks, Neil.Content and Programming Copyright 2006 FOX News Network, Inc. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
