It's not about bonding; bonding is for teenagers at camp. Here, it's just about making it to the convention in Ohio, without killing each other.So number one: No number two on the bus. It is not a Starbucks bathroom in Barnes & Noble, it's a bus.Number two: No sing-a-longs. There's no point to 100 bottles of beer on the wall. Can we please let this evil die with us? It's as bad as children playing Marco Polo.Number three: Don't keep asking truck drivers to honk their horns. Do truckers come to your home and ask you to ring your doorbell?Four: Don't open the window to pretend to play hand airplane. We know you're breaking another kind of wind.Number five: If you can't see it from the freeway, it doesn't exist. Stick to visible drive-thrus. By the way, no one eats fish on the bus. That's like playing death metal in church.Number six: Are you always the last person to get on the bus at every stop? Don't be the person everyone is waiting for, Kimberly.No illicit drugs. The other passengers shouldn't have to endure a cavity search, because you couldn't go without a buzz for a week, Juan.Number eight: Always do roll call when you're leaving a truck stop. That's where most people disappear according to my Uncle Steve who's been on ""Forensic Files"" eight times.Nine: Stay on the main roads. Remember one word : Deliverance.Ten: Have a safe house along the way. You may need to park somewhere private to scrub evidence off the grill.And finally: No arguing about politics or religion. And most of all: No mooning school busses, Eric.Greg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET).

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.STUART VARNEY, GUEST HOST: Reaction now from the former Republican Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal.Governor, do you put any blame on the president's shoulders?BOBBY JINDAL, R-FORMER LOUISIANA GOVERNOR: Well, Stuart, first off, thank you for having me.Look, this is an awful, awful day for the people of Baton Rouge. It is too soon for me to be talking about politics. Our emotions are raw. What we learned today, they're all heroes. But what we learned today, for example, the sheriff's deputy shot and killed when he rushed to aid a wounded city police officer, that city police officer shot and killed, he was wounded and then he was executed.Look, I think now is a time for all of our leaders, from the president on down, down to local officials, to say we're all united, we need to join together and we need to say all lives matter. Stop dividing. We don't need to be divided by racial lines, political lines, ideological lines.And we need to support our police. Eight police officers have now been excused these last several days. They didn't die in the line of duty.  They were executed. We need to support our men and women in blue.VARNEY: Governor, President Obama twice invited leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement to the White House prior to the shootings in Baton Rouge.  Did that send a message to Black Lives Matter? Did it send a message to the anti-police sentiment in this country?What do you think of this?JINDAL: Well, Stuart, again, there will be an appropriate time and place to talk about the president and politics. I'm not a fan of the president's. I have been very critical of the president.But it's barely been 24 hours. And this reason this is so personal to me, we -- my family and I, we have gotten know these law enforcement officials.  For eight years, they have guarded me and my family. My kids have gone hunting and fishing with these men and women.I know it's popular among some very extreme elements in our country to demonize the police. They're men and women. They have families, they have children, they have parents that care about them. They run towards bullets, not away from it, so we can be safe.You listen to the 911 tapes and you hear -- you look a that -- you hear the description of the video, while people are being shot, law enforcement in Baton Rouge ran towards this gunman.VARNEY: Right.JINDAL: They're heroes. There will be a time to talk about the politics, but, for now, I just want to honor these men and women in uniform and to say to anybody out there, let's stop the division. All lives matter.  Let's stop dividing by race.VARNEY: Briefly, Governor, what is the mood between police officers in Baton Rouge now, today, and the black community? What's the mood now?JINDAL: Look, I think there's still shock.I think almost not quite depression. We have got a heavy burden on our shoulders. Baton Rouge, I was born and raised here. We're a united community. This shooter came from outside our community. Look, these are intense days, these last few weeks. We will get beyond this. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.We don't -- it's hard to see right now. But we will get through it. This is a resilient community. We have heroes every day in local and state law enforcement, in Louisiana and Baton Rouge. We appreciate and honor them.VARNEY: A very, very difficult time. Thank you very much, indeed, Governor. We appreciate you being with us. Thank you, sir.JINDAL: Thank you, Stuart. Thank you.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
