Issa also says he will soon ask Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the matter.Reality TVIndiana Republican Congressman Dan Burton's latest TV ad includes testimonials from people talking about why they support him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TESTIMONIAL: ""Lots of people say they're conservative, but Dan Burton has been a consistent conservative voice for us.""DAN BURTON: ""I'm Dan Burton, and I approve this message.""(END VIDEO CLIP)But GOP challenger Luke Messer says the testimonials are not from actual Hoosiers, but are paid actors from Columbus, Ohio.Burton's office acknowledges actors were used, but maintains the message is representative of constituent opinion.
