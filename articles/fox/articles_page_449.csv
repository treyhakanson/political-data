That's weird.The key word there is then for it links both issues, that if you want black votes, why would you stop felons from voting? CNN's implication is that blacks and felons are one in the same. It's amazing.The headline's a concise example of the subtle racism of the liberal media where any reference to crime is a black thing, not just a human thing.Now, imagine using this bigoted headline in other ways:""Clinton wants Jewish vote, then slams greedy bankers""""Gary Johnson courts the Irish, but condemns heavy drinking""""Trump appeals to Hispanics, then calls illegals rapists""Well actually, that happened with Trump at his campaign launch when he conflated Mexico sending criminals here with all illegals.So, how is the CNN headline in any different than that? Well, with the Republicans, everything is always racist, but when its mainstream liberalism, it's thoughtful, which explains why so many cities under thoughtful liberal rule are near ruin.If you view crime as a racial thing and not a human thing, any act to solve it is seen as racial, which hurts the law-abiding folks who don't see race in crime. They just see the lives made worse by those who find politics in their pain.Greg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET).

It's rigged by the media, it's rigged at the polls, it's rigged everywhere. Even ""Saturday Night Live,"" who once let Donald host the show, is involved in this massive conspiracy.Let's quote the book of Newteronomy:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: I think it's amazing that Trump is as close as he is right now considering the one sidedness of the news media barrage and the best description of it is by Barry Casselman in his blog where he said, this is a coup d'etat. He said 14 million citizens and private ballots picked Donald Trump, 20 TV executives decided to destroy him.(END VIDEO CLIP)True, the media is rigged, but it was rigged for Trump all damn year. He got more free media than the weather, dwarfing not just his primary foes, but Hillary as well. If it wasn't for the media who fell over Trump every time he sneezed, we'd have a different candidate. So yeah, it was rigged and that rigging gave us Trump. He should be extremely grateful.Of course now he still gets the same coverage, but it's soaked in opposition research. Was he set up? Could it be the media propelled him to the top of the heap knowing he would be so easy to bring down later? Short answer, yes. Long answer, hell, yes.But it feels like Trump is blaming the refs before the game is played anticipating a loss. And worse, it's a signal that the worst kind of liberal identity politics has spread beyond its borders. We know liberal bias exists, but it used to be that the left were the victimhood kings. But now Trump has stolen their act -- running as the champion of the cheated -- which must upset the left for the media believes only the left can be agreed. Thanks to Trump, now there's competition.Greg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET).
