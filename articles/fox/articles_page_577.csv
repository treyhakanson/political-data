It's not because they'll be vacating the White House shortly, or that they won't have Air Force One at their disposal, or that all those late-night ragers with Vice President Biden will come to an end (c'mon, that guy parties!).No, it's because the First Couple famously loves to go out to eat, and they've never had more good options to choose from in D.C. I mean, really good--we named three D.C. restaurants (Bad Saint, The Dabney, and Tail Up Goat) to our list of the 50 finalists for America's Best New Restaurants.If you're a bit skeptical of my enthusiasm for the D.C. dining scene, you're not alone. After one particular eye-opening visit, I returned to the BA offices in New York and told editor-in-chief and D.C. native Adam Rapoport that his hometown was blowing up. He laughed. Then he told me to get out of his office. He didn't believe me. Look, Adam and I both know that D.C. has had its fair share of incredible chefs: the late-great Jean-Louis Palladin, Michel Richard, Jose Andres, Ann Cashion, Nora Pouillon... the list goes on. But there's something else going on with this new wave of restaurants crashing onto the scene. Yes, D.C. has long been a city that could out power-lunch any place in the country, and great meals could be had at many of the big-box restaurants in the center of town. But now D.C. has more than that: It finally has a ton of great neighborhood restaurants. And they are sprouting up in areas that you would not have imagined ten years ago--neighborhoods like Shaw, Columbia Heights, Barracks Row, and Petworth.I'll admit I'm no expert when it comes to the history of the D.C. restaurant scene. All I can tell you is that there's an energy and excitement surrounding all the new places that is palpable. D.C. is bubbling with momentum. You go in to one place, and you hear about another exciting spot just down the street. The table next to you isn't only talking politics; they're discussing last night's cacio e pepe, too. Chefs like Andres, Fabio Trabocchi, Cathal Armstrong, Peter Pastan, Jamie Leeds, Eric Ziebold, and others laid the foundation for this movement and are still doing bang-up jobs at their many restaurants. Now, they're joined by the likes of Johnny Monis (Komi and Little Serow), Aaron Silverman (Rose's Luxury, our no. 1 Best New Restaurant of 2014, and Pineapple and Pearls), and a bunch more folks whose names you might not recognize now, but you will soon.My list of new D.C. restaurants that I can't wait to return to is a long one. There's the live-fire cooking at The Dabney; the bold Filipino food at Bad Saint; the relentless hospitality at Rose's Luxury and its sister restaurant, Pineapple and Pearls; the top-notch cocktails at Columbia Room; the inventive Southern Mediterranean-inspired food at Tail Up Goat (the goat lasagna is my favorite pasta of the year); the Asian street food at Maketto; all the food stalls packed into Union Market; Kinship; Metier; Whaley's; Daikaya; Convivial; Espita Mezcaleria; Masseria; and a bunch of others I've probably missed (but I'm sure you'll let me know--find me on Twitter at @AndrewOKnowlton).What all these restaurants have in common is fearlessness. There are no consensus polls being taken on what diners might want or need. Instead, these are chefs and restaurateurs who are simply taking their passions and diverse backgrounds and turning those into the restaurants of their dreams. And thankfully, these days, they have a hungry and food-savvy audience that is willing to try new things. I mean, have you seen the lines at Rose's Luxury and Bad Saint these days?So, Mr. President and First Lady, I trust that you'll find the time to check out all the new things going on in your adopted city. Hit as many places as you can. And if by any chance you need a dining companion, I'm available.Want to know where to eat, drink, and shop in D.C. right now? Check out our City Guide.

The class from Hampton Falls, New Hampshire drafted a bill to make the red tail hawk -- the official state raptor.   The bill flew through committee -- so the teacher arranged a field trip to the state house-- to see the bill be voted into law. The class was greeted with applause by House members. But it all went downhill from there.Republican representative Warren Groen-- a vocal opponent of abortion-- took issue with the students' bird of choice-- and how it hunts, quote--""It grasps them with its talons then uses its razor sharp beak to basically tear it apart limb by limb-- and I guess the shame about making this a state bird is it would serve as a much better mascot for Planned Parenthood.""Again-- the fourth grade class was present for the debate. Another lawmaker seemed to think the nine-year-olds' foray into the political process was silly-- frivolous.Quote-- ""We'll be picking a state hot dog next.""In the end-- the House shot down the bird bill-- and possibly a little bit of enthusiasm for politics -- among the youngsters.All in a Day's WorkA union lobbyist is suing the state of Illinois-- for an additional $36,000 year pension-- because he was a substitute teacher for one day. You heard that right.The Chicago Tribune reports David Piccioli already collects $31,000 a year from the Teachers Retirement System for his work with the union.But he found a loop-hole in the state constitution -- working as a substitute for a day-- so he would qualify for more than double that amount.When his scheme was exposed-- the state took measures to close the loophole -- and stop Piccioli from getting the money. Now he is suing-- arguing he is grandfathered in.It's worth noting-- On top of those pensions-- he also earns another $30,000 a year from the state-- for a stint he worked as a legislative aide.Just What the Doctor OrderedAnd finally-- a spry 104-year-old woman says she has a doctor to thank for her longevity - Dr. Pepper.Elizabeth Sullivan says she was turned on to the drink four decades ago-- in her sixties. She drinks three Dr. Peppers a day.She says real doctors keep telling her -- all that soda will kill her -- but quote, ""They die and I don't. So there must be a mistake somewhere.""Happy Birthday, Elizabeth -- and cheers."
