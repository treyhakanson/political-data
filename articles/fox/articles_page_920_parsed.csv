This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS HOST: Breaking tonight, new reaction to a major moment in the 2016 race for the White House. As just moments ago, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Trump wrapping up a presidential forum asking the American people to trust them with protecting the homeland. And to be commander-in-chief to the greatest military the world has ever known.Good evening and welcome to THE KELLY FILE everyone where the news is breaking right now. I'm Megyn Kelly.With just 62 days to go until the election and just more than two weeks until early votes are cast, the major party candidates for president on the same stage for the first time in this campaign tonight. Taking part in an NBC News commander-in-chief forum from the deck of the USS Intrepid right here in New York City. In a wide ranging discussion, Donald Trump challenged over his support for the Iraq war, among other things, and Hillary Clinton confronted over this. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As a naval flight officer, I held a top-secret, sensitive, compartmentalized clearance and that provided me access to materials and information highly sensitive to our war-fighting capabilities. Had I communicated this information not following prescribed protocols, I would have been prosecuted and imprisoned. Secretary Clinton, how can you expect those such as myself who are entrusted with America's most sensitive information to have any confidence in your leadership as president when you clearly corrupted our national security?HILLARY CLINTON, D, PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You know and I know classified material is designated. It is marked. There is a header so that there is no dispute at all that what is being communicated to or from someone who has that access is marked classified. And what we have here is the use of an unclassified system by hundreds of people in our government to send information that was not marked, there were no headers, there was no statement top secret, secret or confidential. I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system. I did exactly what I should have done and I take it very seriously, always have, always will.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Over the next hour, we have a powerful lineup of guests. To analyze the candidates answer tonight, in moments, we'll be joined by Marc Thiessen, former chief speechwriter to President George W. Bush and an AEI fellow. And Krystal Ball, a senior fellow with the New Leaders Council. And then we'll hear from two veterans who served in Iraq. I have two very different take on this election. Also former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino is here, co-host now of ""THE FIVE."" And then Sargent Robert Bartlett, an Iraq war veteran who was wounded by an Iranian made IED. And Larry Korb, former assistant defense secretary under President Reagan.But first our chief political correspondent Carl Cameron is live outside of Trump Tower tonight with the details on an incredible exchange we just saw last hour. Carl.CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: It crackled. And it's important to remember that they actually appeared sequentially. Hillary Clinton won the coin toss and got to go first and Donald Trump was going to get the last word. But it also meant that Hillary Clinton could lob a couple of grenades and Donald Trump might have an opportunity to answer them whereas Trump having the last word could take his shots and not get Hillary Clinton's rebuttal.And they differed in style as well as in substance. On substance whether it was ISIS, the Iraq war, whether it was the VA, a whole host of issues. They each took the opportunity to lob a shot at the other. And on the subject of the VA specifically, Donald Trump suggested that it has been a disaster and he will reform it, though he didn't say specifically how. Whereas Hillary Clinton took a bit of a pounding from Trump for having once said that she thinks that it's perfectly fine the way it is notwithstanding some of the problems that she promised to fix with the general reforms.And Donald Trump got into a bit of trouble particularly when he was talking about how he would form his plan to fight ISIS. He has announced this week that he would, in the first 30 days of his presidency, have the generals of the Pentagon essentially come up with a plan. Tonight he said, he still has his own secret plan and he might choose one or the other. But when the discussion of his knowing more about ISIS than the generals, something that he once said came out, he essentially attacked the generals in general and said that they had been reduced to rubble by the Obama administration and that he would have new generals.  That's not how it works in the military. He'll have to answer for that the next day or so. But there is a clear preview of what the last 60 days are going to be like in this campaign trail. Donald Trump was glib, he was very conversational with the moderator Matt Lauer, whereas Hillary Clinton tended to filibuster a lot of the questions, make very, very long -- almost appeared to stall the answer on a couple of occasions and that kind of lends itself to one of the criticisms of her as being too much like a robotic politician.  Whereas Trump was much looser and occasionally when he's loose like that, he gets himself into a little bit of trouble and there's likely to be some criticism of him for that tonight as well. The next 62 days are certainly going to be a brawl based upon what we saw as they were shadow boxing sequentially -- Megyn.  KELLY: Exciting. Carl, thank you. We have much more cued up for you too. As you saw at the top of the hour, the e-mail questions came fast and furiously at the start of this event. Matt Lauer went for it. Here's a taste of some of that between the moderator Matt Lauer of NBC and Hillary Clinton.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT LAUER, NBC NEWS SHOW HOST: You've said it's a mistake. Why wasn't it more than a mistake? Why wasn't it disqualifying if you want to be commander-in-chief?CLINTON: Well, Matt, first of all as I have said repeatedly, it was a mistake to have a personal account. The real question is the handling of classified material which is I think what the implication of your question was. Classified material has a header which says top secret, secret, confidential. Nothing -- and I will repeat this and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice, none of the e-mails sent or received by me had such a header.LAUER: Director Comey also said this after reviewing all of the information. He said there is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position should have known than an unclassified system was no place for that conversationCLINTON: Well, Matt, I just respectfully point to the hundreds of experienced foreign policy experts, diplomats, defense officials who were communicating information on the unclassified system because it was necessary to answer questions.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Let's start there. Marc Thiessen is a FOX News contributor and former speech writer for President George W. Bush. Krystal Ball is a senior fellow with the New Leaders Council and a Clinton supporter. Great to see you both.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY: Marc, your reaction on that email exchange that went on for quite some time and Lauer did not let up.  THIESSEN: Yes. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, there she goes again. I mean, she came up with yet another new e-mail excuse. And let's review the bidding. Because it's getting a little complicated now.KELLY: Uh-hm.THIESSEN: So, first she said there was no classified information on my server. FBI says that's not true. Then she says no classified information at the time. Also untrue. Then she said nothing marked classified. Also untrue. Now she comes up with a new excuse, there was nothing with a classified header that all classified information has a header. First of all, that's not true. And the law says she's required to protect classified information whether marked or unmarked. The FBI director said she should have known.But second, if there were classified information on her server without any headers, how did it get there? The way it got there was that she and her staff took the headers off. Classified information can't just appear. It has to be entered in. The two systems, the classified email system and the unclassed are not connected. So, somebody -- she or somebody on her staff put classified information on to an e-mail without a header which is a violation of the law and she is using that as a defense. It's unbelievable.  KELLY: Krystal?KRYSTAL BALL, SENIOR FELLOW, NEW LEADERS COUNCIL: You know, Marc says some things that are true there and then he goes a little bit too far beyond what the FBI reported. You know, everything Hillary Clinton said here was absolutely accurate, the emails that she received that did have classified information, they didn't have the proper heading.  KELLY: Why is that an excuse?BALL: As a tactician though --KELLY: No, no, just answer my question. Let's walk the viewers through truly. How is that an excuse?BALL: Well, and that's exactly where I'm going. I don't think it is an excuse and I thought that she needed to take more responsibility here as she has in the past.  KELLY: No, she hasn't.  BALL: I mean, ultimately she didn't screwed up. And there is no denying that and she has acknowledged --  KELLY: She hasn't. She was --  (CROSSTALK)KELLY: -- to say, it was a mistake after about 50 interviews where she tried to dodge, she did not say that.  BALL: She said repeatedly that it was an error.  KELLY: Right. After he said repeatedly that it wasn't and everybody else did it from Colin Powell -- I mean we had months on that answer until finally it was undeniable and she was like, it was a mistake, I'm sorry. And she was like, I apologize. They were like you apologize? She's like, I didn't apologize. And they're like, why not? I'm sorry. That's what happened.  BALL: I don't disagree with you to be honest with you. I think she should have taken direct responsibility immediately. I think it should have come before quickly. And I think we would have been able to -- more quickly if she has been more forthcoming.KELLY: Uh-hm.BALL: But on the facts of the matter, everything she said here was accurate. I actually think the biggest issue for her in terms of what she said was that she had done everything exactly right.  KELLY: That she said that.  BALL: That she said that.KELLY: She shouldn't have said that.BALL: That's been an issue for her politically because ultimately the voters are looking at this and saying, well, you've already acknowledged you didn't do everything right and that's clear. So, accept responsibility, learn the lessons and then we can move forward.KELLY: Uh-hm.BALL: You know, one thing I would say here in terms of whether it's a disqualifying or not, is that ultimately the American people get to decide. They get to look at the facts --KELLY: Yes. Yes, it's up to them. It's up to them. Look, I want to get back --BALL: We get to decide.  KELLY: Go ahead.  THIESSEN: Well, just, number one, what she said wasn't true because she said there was no indication it was classified. There was a C in one of the e-mails that the FBI pointed out to her in her interview and she said that --(CROSSTALK)No, no, hold on, Krystal, I let you talk. I am not done. Hold on.BALL: I'm just correcting.  THIESSEN: Krystal, stop. There was a C next to that. And she said, oh, I thought that was alphabetical. Well, did someone bother to ask her if that alphabetical word was A and B? There was no A and B. She made it up. So, this is another lie. And the thing is --  BALL: No, no, no.  THIESSEN: The FBI -- look, there is right now a United States marine who is being discharged from the service for sending a classified e-mail back to Afghanistan warning his marines about a threat and then self-reporting himself when he realized he had sent classified information. He's been deemed unfit to leave the United States marine, the service United States marine. She wants to be commander-in-chief.  BALL: He was also --THIESSEN: She had 110 classified e-mails that she continues to lie about that included to secret information. How would she fit to be commander-in- chief?  KELLY: Okay. Let her respond.BALL: Just to be clear here, he was also not charged criminally. In that way they were treated in the same.  THIESSEN: He was kicked out of the marines.  BALL: The voters are the ones to get to have the final say whether this is disqualifying or not.KELLY: Yes.BALL: But look, you say that she lied. That is not what the FBI report found, they found that she made a mistake, she didn't recognize that these were classified emails.  THIESSEN: That is not true.  (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)KELLY: I got to leave it there. I got to go. Bye.  Fine. Okay. So -- has got a lot to say about those candidates during this -- sorry -- sometimes you just got to press forward.But one of the moments getting the biggest reaction was this remark from Donald Trump on Iraq.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R, PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I was totally against the war with Iraq. You can look at Esquire Magazine from '04.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: I was totally against the war with Iraq. You can look at Esquire Magazine from 2004. To which a lot of people pointed out that the Iraq war started in 2003, not 2004 and he had a different position as documented by the journalist Howard Stern.Joining me now, co-host of ""THE FIVE,"" White House press secretary under President Bush, Dana Perino. Carl Higbie who is a former Navy SEAL who served two tours in Iraq. And Jon Soltz, who is an army veteran who also served two tours in Iraq and chairman of the group VoteVets.org which led a demonstration outside of Trump Tower today.Great to see you all. Let's start with the military vets on this. It's just -- I mean Trump is on record in 2003 saying that, you know, maybe, maybe he would be behind it.  CARL HIGBIE, FORMER NAVY SEAL: He said yes, I guess so.  KELLY: Yes, I guess so. Okay. But he likes to ignore that but it happened. Right?HIGBIE: Yes. Many other accounts where he said, I'm not for the war in Iraq.  KELLY: Later, you know, in '04. That's why he put it `04. But no '03 when he went into Iraq. He was for it.  HIGBIE: Yes. But the monumental journalist Howard Stern in saying, I guess so, I wouldn't count that as --KELLY: Mock him if you like. But he got it.  HIGBIE: He got it. But I wouldn't call that committing troops to a foreign war.  KELLY: Okay. Go ahead.JON SOLTZ, SERVED TWO TOURS IN IRAQ: I think he was for the war. And I think, you know, the reason he's against it now obviously was because it differentiated him from the rest of the Republican candidates. And that is where it is with Donald Trump. Every time he does an interview, I never know what he's going to say.KELLY: Uh-hm.SOLTZ: And so, I want to became politically convenient for Donald Trump to be against the Iraq war, he was against the Iraq war, but make no mistake, he was for it in the beginning.  KELLY: What about Hillary because she's standing there in front a group of vets, like you guys who served for our country, served our country, interact, many of whom lost soldiers, lost comrades, lost buddies. And watch what she said.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAUER: How do you think these people feel when the person running to be their commander-in-chief says her vote to go to war in Iraq was a mistake?CLINTON: Look. I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake and I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective my mistake. I also believe that it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes, like after action reports are supposed to do. And so we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Dana Perino?DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": Well, I think there's a little selective memory going on. Donald Trump wasn't in a position that Hillary Clinton was in 2003 and the lead up, even after 2001 and 2002. He wasn't in the United States Senate, she wasn't on the Armed Services Committee. She was.KELLY: Uh-hm.PERINO: So, she was privy to the information. So, if he's on Howard Stern's show and says I guess so, I mean, that's pretty much where the rest of the country was as well. I mean -- I don't think it's not fair to actually hold him to that account. Him saying that he wasn't and wasn't, people are going to hold him into account for that. But her, I've never understood why she disavowed that vote, because she used her judgment based on the information that she had at the time.She was not alone. I think that she got pushed into that politically from her far left. And if you'll notice one of the questions tonight from somebody who is self-identified as a progressive, that they're worried about her being too hawkish. They worried that she would actually take too much action.KELLY: Uh-hm.PERINO: But then she goes ahead and she takes something off of the table. She says as president, as commander-in-chief, I would not send any ground troops in. How can you say that? You don't know. And she knows that she doesn't know that.KELLY: And she said no ground troops in Iraq. That's it. But we have ground troops.  HIGBIE: Yep.BALL: And more are going.  KELLY: I have to ask you, Carl. I mean, you guys served there. The rest of us are just pundits, we just sit here. Right? As news anchors. You served there. What is it like to hear her say that?HIGBIE: That battle changes day to day, month to month, year to year. There is no way you can commit a plan now and look, you can hit Donald Trump for not having a plan all that you want but the fact of the matter is, if he's elected, that plan is going to have to change by November. Hillary Clinton has never been on the right side of a foreign conflict her entire time in office. I mean, everything she does. Her judgment is wrong. It always ends up wrong, and it always ends up getting people killed and it always ends up hurting America. So, I would rather have Donald Trump who's actually going to sit there and say, generals, give me a plan in 30 days, let's execute it. Go.  KELLY: Go ahead.SOLTZ: The reason her vote doesn't bother me is because I was in Iraq in 2003 with the First -- Division. And I supported the war. And I support it because I believed the leaders of my country that we were going to find weapons of mass destruction. It's something that's hard for me still. I regret that opinion every day of my life and it's one of the reasons that I opposed intervention in Libya.I think Dana is right in regards to the politics of it. Obama was very much running against her in 2008 to be against the Iraq war and she voted for it and then, you know, she turns around and supports Libya. So, she clearly is playing a little bit of politics on her positions here. And the concern that I have still is, when she had another decision in Libya, she decided to intervene there and that has not worked out well for this country.  KELLY: No. What about Trump saying, all this time, he's got a plan to defeat ISIS and he just needs 30 days with the generals. And 30 days, first 30 days of his presidency, he is going to get a plan from the generals. And then he says, they're going to give him his plan. All this time he's got a secret plan, then we say, what is it? Then he finally gives us a big reveal which is, I'm going to ask the generals. And then he gets to, actually I'm going to fire the generals because they lose so much, they've been losing for a long time. Carl? Really?HIGBIE: He had a goal, not a plan. He had a goal. I think having these top secret briefings and having the more experience on the political specter, he is getting to know that there's substantially more to this policy than just, you know, reading a book or watching CNN. There is a necessary -- there's a need for him to listen to the generals, listen to the people who've been on the ground.  KELLY: He just said, they're going to be fired. He said the generals had been reduced to rubble and they've been losing for a long time.HIGBIE: Well, the good generals --KELLY: That's what he said.HIGBIE: Well, the good generals have been fired. I mean, Obama got rid of a lot of the generals that were willing to push back on him and he just kept a bunch of crappy ones to be honest that are --  KELLY: So, the remaining generals are crappy.HIGBIE: Not all of them but many.  KELLY: Let's walk that back. Let's walk that back.HIGBIE: I'll double down.  KELLY: Go ahead, Jon.SOLTZ: General McChrystal was fired. And General McChrystal was an interventionist. He's, you know, he was very much into the Petraeus, you know, counter-insurgency policy which is, let's not insult Islam and Muslims. I mean, he is completely inconsistent with where Donald Trump would be. So, if you're saying Obama fired good generals, that was fired by the President certainly would not be someone I think who --  (CROSSTALK)I will also tell you that this 30-day plan is a joke. The problem with ISIS is not necessarily just a military problem. It's much more vast than that. And to be honest, the administration is actually doing, you know, a better job than they're probably getting credit for right now inside Iraq. I was one of the last advisers out. We are seeing the Iraqi army conduct office of combat operations for the first time and the question is, who is going to own this when we're done. And if we go in and use U.S. force and large amounts of ground troops, then we're back to where we were in 2004. We own a lot of territory.KELLY: Okay. Stand by. Because we have much more with you guys and with Dana and a few other guests. Because in moments, we're going to get to the explosive questions on Iran with Sergeant Robert Bartlett, an Iraq war veteran who is wounded by an Iranian made IED. And Larry Korb, former assistant Defense Secretary under President Reagan.Plus, more on the plan for defeating ISIS still ahead.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAUER: When people like me press you for details like that gentlemen just said on what your plan is, you very often say, I'm not going to give you the details because I want to be unpredictable.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Nearly eight months after the Obama administration sent $400 million to Iran, we are learning details tonight of new payments, not once but twice with a total of $1.7 billion in cash being paid to Tehran. Critics have called the money a ransom, payment in exchange for four American hostages being held by Iran. But the Obama administration maintains it was simply paying back money owed from a failed arms deal in the late 1970s. Now the interest was running so we had to cut that check or hide that currency and send it in weird bills. Tonight Hillary Clinton was asked about her involvement in the nuclear deal with Iran.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAUER: You have said you expect the Iranians to cheat. Do you think they're playing us?  KELLY: On the nuclear issues, no. What I am focused on is all the other malicious activities of the Iranians, ballistic materials, support for terrorist, being involved in Syria, Yemen and other places, supporting Hezbollah, Hamas. But here's the difference, Matt. I would rather as president be dealing with Iran on all of those issues without having to worry as much about their racing for a nuclear weapon.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Sergeant Robert Bartlett and Larry Korb. Good to see you both.Sergeant Bartlett, your thoughts on this latest payment. So now we've got $1.3 billion more that we paid the Iranians in addition to the $400 million we already paid and Hillary Clinton defending the Iran deal tonight that we struck on the nuke saying, he's got no concerns about it.  SGT. ROBERT BARTLETT, VETERANS AGAINST THE DEAL: Yes. It's amazing thing is that this actually happened in a place on part of that museum that's there. And here they're having American debate on what the future of America is going to be. We're sending billions over to a terrorist regime that's already secured S-300s to defend their nuke sites in the future. You know and she expects that they're going to cheat now, she says they're going to cheat now and they already cheated but they're not going to cheat on the nukes. Why wouldn't they cheat on the nukes? You know, they've already cheated on the ballistic missiles. It doesn't make any sense.  KELLY: What's the answer to that Larry? Right? Why? Why wouldn't they?LARRY KORB, SENIOR FELLOW, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: Well, first of all, the ballistic missile is not cheating. In part of the nuclear deal we allowed them to go ahead with that. The International Atomic Energy Agency says, they're not cheating on the deal because they're in there and they're having intrusive inspections. And remember, the deal is not just with us, it's with six countries around the world. So, it's not just us that they have to do, particularly if they want access to the money and the banking systems of the major countries in the world.  KELLY: Go ahead.  BARTLETT: Let's talk about this. If they say hey, these other countries can go in there and inspect these sites, how did that work with Iraq? Because we've already done that once. That doesn't make much sense.  KORB: Now wait a second. On Iraq what happened was the International Atomic Energy Agency told Bush to wait, let them finish the inspections and Bush didn't do it because he had all of the forces in there. In fact --BARTLETT: Twelve years of them breaking those sanctions.  KORB: Wait a second.  BARTLETT: Twelve years of them breaking the sanctions with Clinton, Bush Sr. and Bush Jr., the whole thing, they kept breaking the sanctions every time Iraq did whatever they wanted.KORB: Well, they didn't. I mean, we bombed them when they violated --  BARTLETT: That's right. We had to bomb them.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY: Okay. Right. Because we're talking about Iraq as well and the question of whether Trump's plan, you know, the plan is he's going to get the plan from the generals, the generals who he's going to fire because they're a bunch of losers. But he's going to mix in some of his own plan as well which has yet to be revealed but may involve taking the oil. Okay? So, your thoughts on that Sergeant Bartlett on this whole bit about we're going the take the oil, we're going to take the oil, we're going to take the oil.  BARTLETT: You know if you go on for the oil, you say then. Then the American public says, hey, you went in there for the oil. You know? You've got to go in there to do the right thing, period. It doesn't matter. We have to live with integrity as a country and do the right thing, period. I would say to Trump, listen to the subject matter experts, let them inform you why we went into Iraq, give you the full spectrum and not just everything that you've learned from the media over the last 15 years on the issue or 12 years on the issue.  KELLY: What did you make of it Larry when he refused to acknowledge a mistake in saying that he knows more about Iraq and ISIS than the generals?KORB: Well, again, that's typical of him. He seems to know more than everything. And by the way, it's against the law to fire the generals expect for cause because we want the generals to be honest both to the President and the Congress and after Vietnam when there was pressure put on him, the law was changed. They were there for fix four year terms for the service chiefs. Two years for the chairmans. So, this idea that you can fire them, no you can only do it for cause. So, it shows again, I don't think he understands how the system works.  KELLY: Stand by. Because I still have my panel out here. And I want to ask Dana Perino because she's shaking her head as you say that Larry in agreement with you. I don't think you two often agree but --  PERINO: I agree with you, Larry.KELLY: You agree with Larry.PERINO: When Trump said that during the forum --KELLY: I'm going to fire a lot of them.  PERINO: Because they lose all of the time and they don't know --  KELLY: Do we have that sound bite? I mean, let me just ask if we have the sound bite? No, the Trump on the generals. It's a mystery. Okay, they're looking for it. Okay, go ahead Dana.PERINO: So when he said that, that's when I thought, oh my goodness. And so, I was following him on Twitter at the same time and Hugh Hewitt the radio host and also been very supportive, Donald Trump says, oh my gosh, it's probably not a good idea to criticize the flag officers of the people that you are trying to get to support your candidacy.KELLY: Uh-hm.PERINO: But not only that, I mean, it is true. You can't, as a commander- in-chief sitting at the White House, you can't look over at the Pentagon and say, okay, I'm picking you and you and you and you're out. Because that actually undermines the entire system.KELLY: Well, the other problem is, you tell me, you guys are still here, you served, he's never served a day in his life. He had a draft deferment.  SOLTZ: Draft dodger. True.  KELLY: And to be calling out these generals as a bunch of losers might be perceived as disrespectful by some.SOLTZ: It's another disrespectful issue. I think one of the mistakes that NBC made, Matt Lauer specifically was he didn't press Donald Trump on his respect for the military. Why is he disrespectful to Gold Star families for instance? And so it is disrespectful --KELLY: Who other than the Khans, he doesn't like the Khans who got up at --SOLTZ: Well, when you stand up and say, I always wish I had a Purple Heart, it looks like you're a little detached. When you go on a radio show and --  KELLY: That was like a shot at you, gone awry.SOLTZ: I mean, listen, I think there's others --KELLY: But you've got plenty of easy targets there.  (CROSSTALK)SOLTZ: There's a look of knowledge that came out of that also with the oil. And that's what I've key into. The oil in Iraq was the reason there was so much strife. So the Sunni areas --KELLY: Give us a third-grade explanation.  SOLTZ: It's really simple because Sunnis don't control the oil in Iraq. The Kurds and the Shia did. And that was the reason we were fighting so much. The Sunni wanted that access to those oil and the revenue sharing, and so to go in and just talk about taking oil just shows complete lack of knowledge.KELLY: So people might get upset?SOLTZ: Absolutely. I mean, our allies and the Kurds are going to be like, why are you taking the oil from us? I mean, we haven't done this since ever in our history.HIGBIE: Let's go back to the general comment and let's see. President Obama has fired an unprecedented amount of generals for saying -- for telling it how it is. I mean, they fired General Mattis for straight up going and saying, ""I don't like the way this war is going. You need to do this to win,"" and he was ousted.There are tons of generals -- I looked them up during the break -- that have been put out by this guy. Now, Trump is going to go in there and say look, you people have been politically correct. You've been unelected bureaucrats. You've made rank by just not offending somebody and not causing any major problems.He's going to get rid of those guys, put guys in there who want to serve, guys like, you know, who he has surrounded himself with like Mike Flynn and things like that and say, ""Go get the job done and tell me how to do it.""KELLY: All right, stand by. We have much more coming up because this was nowhere near close to everything that happened tonight, but I do -- we have the sound bite and I want you to hear it because there was sort of a triple hit on the generals. It's already making big waves. We're going to play it for you right after the break when we resume with our panel and some other guests as well. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The generals under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have not been successful. ISIS...LAUER: Do you know more about ISIS than they do?TRUMP: I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton the generals have been reduced to rubble. They have been reduced to a point where it's embarrassing for our country.LAUER: But you're going to convene a panel of generals and you've already said you know more about ISIS than those generals?TRUMP: Well, they probably would be different generals to be honest with you. I mean I'm looking at the generals -- today you probably saw -- I have a piece of paper here, I could show it, 88 generals and admirals endorsed me today.LAUER: It's a numbers game. Hillary Clinton claims more numbers.TRUMP: And these are -- well, it's not really -- you know, it's not really, yeah, numbers. People that have been losing for us for a long period of time.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Back now with our panel, Dana Perino, Jon Soltz, Carl Higbie -- Soltz, sorry Jon. We also still have Larry Korb and Sergeant Robert Bartlett are still with us. So, I want to actually start with Sergeant Bartlett on this as somebody who served and was injured in the service of our country. Your thought on Trump's hit on the generals there.BARTLETT: You know, as time goes on he's going to get a rude awakening on a lot of things that he said. I've seen some humility come out in the past. I hope it continues. If we have more policies that get us in more wars, then we're going to have more issues and you better listen to the subject matter experts because they know. He's a subject matter expert in running businesses, he really is. He's an amazing man who made a lot of money in this country.So, I would ask him a business question. Let's ask the generals their questions. How to stay out of war? How to conquer countries that we need to? How to get in and out of places that we need to? How to stop regimes from continuing to kill Americans and other country civilians and their own civilians, like Iran is doing today?KELLY: Larry, your thoughts on Trump's talking about that and also talking about his intelligence briefing saying he could read the body language of the briefers which he found very helpful.LARRY KORB, CENTER FOR DEFENSE INFORMATION SENIOR ADVISER: Well, I think it's important to keep in mind it's not just the generals who make policy. That's why you have civilian control of the military. You got a Secretary of Defense with all kinds of assistance. Like I remember when I was there, giving advice on things like should we stay in Lebanon? Should we get out of Lebanon, which was the big issue?If you go back and look at history, what you want are generals like General Dunford, who is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He tells it like it is and he also goes up to Congress and tells them. They said, ""Hey, we think we ought to spend more money on defense than Obama asked, OK."" That's what they do.But once the civilians make a decision, like General Shinseki was opposed to what was happening -- he's the Army Chief of Staff about Iraq -- how many troops we were sending. But once a decision was made, he saluted and carried it out.KELLY: OK, but I want to tell the audience that, you know, Sergeant Bartlett raises an issue or point about we need somebody who understands, understands where to go, where not to go, what wars to get us into, what wars not to get us into, and one of the questions came at Hillary tonight from someone who thought she might be a little too, as Trump described her, trigger happy. A little too anxious to get us involved in these foreign conflicts. Listen here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You have had an extensive record with military intervention. How do you respond to progressives like myself who worry and have concerns that your hawkish foreign policy will continue?HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I assume you're talking about Iraq because of my vote. Let me say very clearly, I view force as a last resort, not a first choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Does her record support that, Carl?HIGBIE: No. I think she has dove head first into every single conflict trying to overthrow every single government that she possibly had a chance to, in the State Department and even when she was working...KELLY: Expect Iran.HIGBIE: Well, except Iran. Except that now, she's given them an even bigger vacuum just like she wanted to vote for Iraq to take the troops out and expose the vacuum crisis. She's given them even a bigger vacuum to exist in now. So, I think she has a horrible record on this campaign.KELLY: What do you make on that, Jon, because this is an area which Trump may pick up some progressives and she may pick up some of the more, you know, neo-cons in the Republican Party because there's a question about who is farther to the right when it comes to fighting these overseas battles.SOLTZ: Yeah, I always thought Mitt Romney missed an opportunity here in Afghanistan because President Obama put more troops in Afghanistan and we haven't really seen a dividend from that, and Hillary Clinton is supporting that. And so, I think the problem with a lot of people in regards to Donald Trump, that are more libertarian basis, they don't know where he stands on anything for instance, yes, he talks about being against the Iraq War but then, as we saw tonight, he's for it. Hillary Clinton does have an intervention problem. It doesn't just...KELLY: He didn't say he was for the Iraq war.HIGBIE: He's for finishing the job...SOLTZ: No, no, Donald Trump's initial conversation on the Howard Stern Show where he expressed support and then changed his position so, but let's look at Hillary Clinton. She supported the Iraq War. She supported sending more troops in Afghanistan, which was controversial, and then she supported Libya.The only thing that really checkmates her is her political base and her political support and, you know, individuals like the young woman who asked that question, which is a large percentage of the progressive base doesn't support the intervention that she needs to win this race.KELLY: All right, coming up, Donald Trump said something about Russia tonight that could spell, well, we'll see how it plays in this campaign going forward. Marc Thiessen and Krystal Ball are next on that. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin and I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia. Russia wants to defeat ISIS as badly as we do. If we had a relationship with Russia, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could work on it together and knock the hell out of ISIS? Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing?LAUER: Well, let me ask you about some of the things you've said about Vladimir Putin. You said, ""I will tell you in terms of leadership, he's getting an A and our president is not doing so well."" And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you. I think he called you a brilliant leader. You said, ""It's always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond.""TRUMP: Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating according to the different pollsters, who by the way, some of them were based right here. Look...LAUER: He's also guy who annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, supports Assad and Syria, supports Iran. He's trying to undermine our influence in key regions of the world and according to our intelligence community, probably is the main suspect for the hacking of the DNC computers.TRUMP: Well, nobody knows that for a fact.LAUER: But do you want to be complimented by that former KGB officer?TRUMP: Well, I think when he calls me brilliant I'll take the compliment, OK.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was a moment for our tonight's candidate forum, continuing to generate some fallout. And ""Washington Post"" columnist Marc Thiessen thinks it could become a bigger story in days ahead. He's back along with Krystal Ball, who's a senior fellow at the New Leaders Council.OK, so he's a leader, more so than president Obama, and 82 percent of the Russian people, when told by the government they needed to say that, did. What? Wait. You know, he's a little -- he's scary. They're a little scared over there is what people say.THIESSEN: Absolutely. I mean, I'm old enough to remember when it was the Democrats who were soft on Moscow and the Republicans who didn't like the KGB so, we're having a little bit of a role reversal here, but look, I think this actually could cost him the election.KELLY: What?THIESSEN: There's been a lot of focus on how Donald Trump is alienating Hispanic-American voters but there are millions of East European-American voters out there -- Polish-Americans, Ukrainian-Americans, Slovak- Americans, Czech-Americans who traditionally are part of the Republican coalition. They joined the Republican coalition when Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union an evil empire and said tear down this wall and they've been reliable Republican voters.They don't like the see the Republican presidential nominee praising Vladimir Putin and saying well, we might not support NATO's commitment to defend Eastern Europe. And where do these voters reside? They reside in most of the key swing states that Donald Trump needs to win. They're in Ohio, they're in Pennsylvania, they're in Michigan, they're in Florida, by the millions.George Bush won Florida by a couple hundred votes. If a million Polish- Americans, Czech-American, Hungarian-American, even a small number of those people don't turn out for him in Florida or don't turn out for him in Ohio and some of these states, that could tip the election. So, this Putin bromance could be sort of the secret story of why Donald Trump loses some of those key swing states.KELLY: What do you make of it, Krystal, because you know, he's trying to sort of do a straight talk thing where he's like, wouldn't it be great if we could just get along with a country as, you know, powerful as Russia that could help us defeat ISIS. And you know, that has a certain appeal I think to regular folks, like, yes it would. Why are we the only ones out there, or that's how it feels, in these battles against terror?BALL: Yeah, I mean, it does have a certain appeal, but you've got to have a partner to work with. And I think for a guy who has absolutely no public service record, no international experience in terms of foreign policy or military leadership, voters look at this and go, ""You must be crazy."" I mean, this man is murdering journalists, he's killing off his political opponents...KELLY: He's a leader.BALL: ...he's quashed democracy in the country and he's destroyed the economy, too. I mean, if you go there and look, it's not doing so well. So, even from that standpoint, and I think it's pretty obvious that Trump was very swayed by Putin's flattery of him. It doesn't take much to get right to his ego and that appears to be the key to his heart.So, I think it really undermines his judgment and cause him to question what exactly his moral compass is when he would have such -- I mean, you got to give him credit. He's been very consistent. He's loved Putin from the beginning and he stills loves him today and he's not backing off of it. But I think most American voters, if you poll them on Putin's approval rating, you will get a very, very different answer.KELLY: Now, I want to ask you this, tonight Reince Priebus tweeted out about Hillary Clinton that, ""she was angry and defensive the entire time. No smile and uncomfortable. Upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets."" She responded saying, ""actually, that's just taking the -- that's just what taking the opposite president seriously looks like."" Your thoughts on that Marc?THIESSEN: Well, I expected Reince Priebus to say that and I expect Hillary Clinton to say that back.KELLY: Well, what do you think, I mean, you know, Reince spoke she's not smiling. I mean, really? What?THIESSEN: You know, I care less if she smiles or -- hold on Krystal. I care less if she smiles or doesn't smile, if she'd start telling the truth. If she starts telling the truth, that would be a step forward. I don't care if she smiles or not.KELLY: I got to go but I want to know what Krystal thinks. I'm going to find out during the break and then tell you on the other side because it's a hard break. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) VOICEOVER: From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: I'm going to tell you Krystal's reaction in one minute. But in the meantime, there's new reaction tonight when it comes to Donald Trump's military policy. Tonight's forum comes on the heels of a military-focused speech earlier tonight that had some questioning his commitment to the armed forces. Trace Gallagher has the details from our West Coast newsroom. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, when it comes to military spending, critics say in recent years Donald Trump has done a 180, completely changing his stance. Others believe that Trump's position is steady, but evolving, but as you go through previous statements, it is clear that Trump has sent mixed signals. Here he is on Fox News in 2013 talking about military spending cuts known as the sequester. Listen.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)TRUMP: I think you're going to have to do a lot more cutting. If you're going to balance budgets, you're going to do a lot more cutting and there's no question about it.(END AUDIO CLIP)GALLAGHER: In fairness, some of the cuts he referred to were across the board cuts, but he also said he believed the sequester cuts were over exaggerated and that they would not have the impact on the military that many thought. Today, Mr. Trump appeared to believe those military cuts were significant enough that they prevented military leaders from planning for our future events and then he said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: As soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and we'll submit a new budget to rebuild our military. It is so depleted. We will rebuild our military.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Tonight during the Commander-In-Chief forum, Trump again seemed to dismiss his early belief that sequester spending would not affect the military by restating that he thinks the military is very badly depleted. Trump says he will offset the increase in military spending by asking Congress to make the government leaner overall. Megyn?KELLY: Trace, thank you. So she said that there was plenty to criticize Hillary on. She's a Hillary supporter, but you didn't have to make the smile -- one of them, smile. Has anybody ever looked at you and said, smile, isn't it irritating? You want to do exactly the opposite in response. You know what, we'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Love to know your thoughts on tonight's forum. Send me a tweet @megynkelly on twitter and go to facebook.com/thekellyfile with your thoughts. Let me know. I'm Megyn Kelly. Thanks for watching. This is ""The Kelly File.""

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, just hours after the end of the Memorial Day holiday, America's veterans in a political fight over millions in donations and the race for the White House.Good evening, everyone, and welcome to ""The Kelly File."" I'm Megyn Kelly.  Earlier today, Donald Trump holding an epic 40 minute news conference from the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City. Mr. Trump trying to put to rest lingering controversy over millions dollars in donations, raised for the men and women in America's armed forces. Outside Trump Tower, a dozen veterans staged a protest against the billionaire Republican front-runner.  They are accusing him of using them as political props. But inside, standing on the stage behind Mr. Trump, were his own veteran supporters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AL BALDASARO, AL BALDASARO, NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE REPRESENTATIVE: I would never, ever in a million years put my name on a candidate that did not from his heart look me in the eye and tell me he's concerned about veterans.  That's Donald Trump. I think the liberal media, and I've been dealing with you a long time, you need to get your head out of your butt, focus on the real issues.ALEXANDER MCCOY, FORMER MARINE: What Donald Trump doesn't understand is he cannot buy the votes of veterans in this country. No matter how much he donates, he still is not standing for the values that veterans stand for.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And on the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton's team making it no secret that they are trying to push this controversy to the voters. This is Clinton's campaign today unleashing surrogates to highlight what they say are Donald Trump's past disparaging remarks about veterans. In moments, we'll be joined by two of the veterans there today. One of whom spoke at the Trump event. They have two very different takes on Trump.But first, we begin with chief political correspondent campaign, Carl Cameron who was inside the Trump event today. Carl?  CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CAMPAIGN: Thanks Megyn. A very combative news conference today. And this all goes back really to February when Donald Trump chose to skip a Fox News debate and set up a time that he would instead hold a rally to raise money for veterans. And he said it would be nice to raise about $1 million. Back then, he said that they would look for a number charities to be donating to. And as the dollars started rolling in, much to his surprise, it was much more than $1 million.And ultimately, it got up to several campaign staffers and sometimes Mr. Trump himself said, it was anywhere between four, five, six or maybe even more millions of dollars. And over time, reporters began to ask which charities got the money, how much, how were those charities selected, were they vetted or not, might be there a possibility of getting scammed by some sort of a bogus veterans organization. And the Trump campaign was not forthcoming with very many answers. Today, at his news conference, he blamed the media and said that he'd been treated totally unfairly.And the total -- $5.6 million he's collected. And he said that there was probably some more coming in. And from the original list of about 20 or 22 beneficiaries, groups that would have gotten this money, it went up to more than 40 today. And campaign aides say in the last couple of weeks about another million and a half or $2 million was in fact all doled out for a total of 5.6. It's over. The money's been given often to charities. And Donald Trump is now blaming the media and essentially saying that what they were doing was unfair.Now, the truth of the matter is, the Clinton campaign has been protesting Trump and driving a lot of the questions in the press, saying that it was unfair and Trump is somehow been stove piping the money and not making it available. The Trump campaign argues that they were just vetting it and they need to make sure that it was going to go to the right people at the right time and now that's been done. Both campaigns use vets.  Notwithstanding their service and patriotic efforts for the country there are plenty of liberal service vets, plenty of conservative vets and they're picking up sides right now -- Megyn.KELLY: Carl, thank you.Joining us now with more, Al Baldasaro, he's a retired U.S. Marine Corps, first sergeant, Republican, New Hampshire State representative and veteran adviser to the Trump campaign. And Raymond Curtis is a decorated disabled combat Iraq war veteran and part of the vets versus hate movement. Great to see you both. Thank you guys, for your service and for being here.  BALDASARO: Thank you for your service, by the way.  RAYMOND CURTIS, DISABLED IRAQ WAR VETERAN: Thank you very much.KELLY: Let me start with you, Representative. So, you were there on behalf of Trump today. Speak to the reporting by the ""Washington Post"" and the AP that said Trump did not cut those checks, at least half of them, until the past week, after ""The Washington Post"" started pressing for where the money had gone.  BALDASARO: Right, first of all, I want to clarify something. I was there on behalf of veterans, okay, who were in need, and Donald Trump has to be one who supports those veterans. So, I want to clarify that. As far as the money that is being sent in today, you know, it takes time to vet. In New Hampshire, we have attorney general who constantly going after veteran groups that are raising money to help veterans. Twenty cents of the dollar goes to the veterans. There's so many scams going on there. So it takes time when you're dealing with that.  KELLY: Are you suggesting then that all these veterans groups, nearly half of them were just cleared coincidentally in the past week since ""The Washington Post"" submitted its report?BALDASARO: You know, what we're doing, we're nitty-gritty, we're picking and choosing.  KELLY: No, it speaks to honesty, that's what we're talking about.BALDASARO: What it speaks --CURTIS: I actually wanted to respond to this.KELLY: Go ahead, Ray.CURTIS: Because we have the American Veterans Foundation, one of the organizations that Trump claims to have fully vetted when he was given an enough time and then donated money to. But you can check yourself right now, Google, the ratings.KELLY: They have an ""F"" rating. They have an ""F"" rating. But apparently that was because they were harassing people to donate and they said that was just our telemarketers and we replaced that telemarketer.  CURTIS: Also 75 percent of donations goes to something other than veterans. So the 20 and 25 cents a dollar that you're trying to avoid wasn't avoid --KELLY: But Raymond, speak to Al's point which is, he was going to give the money. He was going to give some portion of millions, some millions of dollars to these vets. But it does take some time to, you know, vet them.BALDASARO: Right.CURTIS: Well, yes, absolutely. And I think the main point here, and for all of us that were there on the grassroots organization moving there to make a statement and bring light to something not organized by anyone except for Alex McCoy, the main point that were there is not about the money. We don't care. You can write us a check for $30 million and give it to a bunch of veterans. That is very wonderful. And I am very happy that my fellow brothers and sisters who served in the Armed Forces is going to get that. However, now the issue is transparency. Now the issue is honesty. Now the issue is integrity. Selfless service. A lot of these things are moral values and core values of the military that he is not representing.KELLY: What about that, Al? Because Trump and his campaign said that they had raised $6 million after they had this event and then they don't even have that now.  BALDASARO: I brought in a list of of course, 5.6. You know, I've done many fund-raisers back then.CURTIS: I can tell you about the money --BALDASARO: Can you take a break there, young man? Thank you.KELLY: Go ahead.  BALDASARO: I've been to many other places where the money -- make donations -- until the checks clear or the money comes in that people donated on the phone, that's it.KELLY: Right. But I mean, to suggest that this is --BALDASARO: Let me --KELLY: -- pure coincidence that half of it came in in the last week after ""The Washington Post"" did its report, I mean, Al, isn't that stretching it a bit?BALDASARO: You know, we're trying to grab on to things here. This is what they're talking about with Hillary Clinton right there--KELLY: He was out there with Raymond --CURTIS: Yes. Absolutely.  KELLY: And you say he's affiliated with Hillary.  CURTIS: Yes. Absolutely and --  KELLY: And her campaign admitted that they tried to promote this protest.  BALDASARO: Right. Yes.  KELLY: Are you affiliated with her? Did you reach out to the campaign?(CROSSTALK)CURTIS: There were many campaigns that were reached out to by the organizers to get information --  KELLY: So, were they using you as props?CURTIS: Absolutely not.BALDASARO: Yes.CURTIS: We started this and we organized this and I worked with Perry and I worked with Alex and so I have this all internalized. And so, all you have to do is simply look very shortly into this and you will quickly see that these allegations are untrue and what --KELLY: But you're a Democrat, you're a Republican. It's not surprising that you guys -- okay, but what is it about Trump that you object to?  Because, you know, he is whatever you can query the reasons it took him so long, but he is getting this money to veterans.  CURTIS: What is it about Trump donating?KELLY: Yes.CURTIS: Or what is it about Trump in general that I object too?KELLY: That you object too. I mean, was there a moment that --CURTIS: Absolutely.(CROSSTALK)For a very long time, I tried to stay out of any discussions about this. I don't like to try and influence other people and how they vote. I like for them to be able to find their own ways and also, you know, it's just something I fundamentally disagree with. However, when Trump made his statement that he would target the families of terrorist cells, innocent civilians, it gave me pause. And I thought, wait, though, let's give them a chance to rescind that. When he was given the opportunity to take it back, he did not, he stood by it. He stood by it in the debate. And that was where I went from the moments of, I'm not going to engage to, I must engage.  KELLY: Okay. I will give you a quick word --BALDASARO: So, in other words now, he took a personal issue, used veterans as political pawns, instead of we're talking about the veterans funds that are getting out there.CURTIS: So -- for speaking out --BALDASARO: In the trenches that the veterans need, one dollar is one dollar more that go to veterans and other issues that we have throughout the community. Thank God we got somebody like Trump.  KELLY: Great to see you both. Thank you guys.CURTIS: Thank you.KELLY: We appreciate it.Well, the Republican front-runner was dealing with more than just a fight over vets today. He was also defending his attack on a federal judge.  U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel is presiding over the lawsuit against Trump University. A now defunct real estate seminar set up by the candidate about a decade ago. During a campaign speech Friday, Trump spent more than ten minutes hammering this judge. And here is just a bit of those remarks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He's a hater. His name is Gonzalo Curiel. And he is not doing the right thing. And I figured what the hell, why not talk about it for two minutes. The judge was appointed by Barack Obama, Federal Judge. Frankly, he should recuse himself. The judge who happens to be we believe Mexican, which is great, I think that is fine.  They ought to look into Judge Curiel because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace, okay? But we'll come back in November -- wouldn't that be wild if I'm president, that I come back to do a civil case?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Trace Gallagher has more. Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, these 381 pages of documents related to Trump University that were unsealed and made public by a San Diego Federal Judge are essentially playbooks that detail exactly how Trump University was run. Everything from convincing prospective students to pay up to $35,000 to enroll to teaching them how to use tax breaks and financial shelters to maximize profits. The school's real estate training was said to be blessed by Donald Trump himself.In fact, Trump claims he personally chose the instructors but later in a deposition admitted that he didn't pick them, in fact, didn't even know their names. Trump and the now defunct school are being sued by a number of students who claim they were defrauded. But as you heard in this epic 12 minute tirade, Trump believes Judge Gonzalo Curiel is giving him a raw deal. And the Trump campaign is now actively supporting the claim of judicial bias. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATRINA PIERSON, DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER: I think what's really interesting about this particular judge, as Mr. Trump refers to him as a Trump hater, if he even mentions on his judicial questionnaire that he was a La Raza Lawyers Association member. This is an organization that has been out there organizing these anti-Trump protesters with the Mexican flags. They are pushing it --(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Judge Curiel has not responded to Mr. Trump's tirade but did release a statement saying the defense had not met the bar to keep the documents out of the public eye, saying, quoting, ""The defendant became the front-runner for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race and has placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue."" The trial date is scheduled for November 28th. And Trump's lawyers say, the GOP nominee will testify. Of course, by then, he could be the president- elect, Megyn.  KELLY: All right, Trace, thank you. And there is important clarification on what you just heard there about Katrina Pierson's allegations about this judge.I'm going to get to it with my panel.Joining me now, Trump supporter and Attorney David Wohl and Ben Shapiro, former Breitbart News editor-at-large and editor-in-chief now at DailyWire.com. Good to see you both.So, that allegation by Katrina Pierson is wrong and I just want to correct the record. La Raza Lawyers Association is completely different from the group that's organizing the anti-Trump protests, which is national council on La Raza. They are not affiliated and they are not the same. That was an error by Katrina. Having said that, I'll ask you, Ben, about the appropriateness of going after a sitting federal court judge and mentioning the fact that, quote, ""He is Mexican, also wrong, he is American, he is not Mexican.""BEN SHAPIRO, FORMER BREITBART NEWS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: No, he was born in Indiana, but -- typical Trump. Again, it's not a surprise that Trump is going after people he feels victimized him. This is sort of what he does.  But to go after the judge on the base of his ethnicity is a little bit bizarre. Given the fact, again, that his ethnicity really has nothing to do with the case and it demonstrates once again that for Trump who has plenty of grounds to go after this judge, by the way. The fact that he's an Obama appointees, you heard it mentioned by Trump.The fact that he has relations with groups that Trump finds unpleasant, all those are fine, but to go after his ethnicity that demonstrates that for Trump there's some sort of bizarre connection between the ethnicity of the person and the ideology the person must hold. I don't know why him being a Mexican would be relevant to the conversation. Especially when he's not from Mexico, and his parents are Mexican.  KELLY: David, why would it be?DAVID WOHL, TRUMP SUPPORTER: Yes. I don't think it's a non sequitur, Megyn --  KELLY: Why does he keep mentioning it over and over when he rips on this judge?WOHL: Yep, I think his ethnicity is Hispanic, he's from Indiana. Non sequitur, Megyn. The issue of him going after this judge, though, I got to say, you know, this is -- how is this any different than Barack Obama in 2010 at the State of the Union when he ripped, he excoriated the Supreme Court justice who were sitting right in front of him --KELLY: Also totally appropriate and out of line. Out of line.WOHL: About a Citizens United case, Megyn, he bullied them right in front of them. And you know what, Megyn --KELLY: So are you justifying that behavior by pointing to other bad behavior?WOHL: Well, Megyn, I'm just saying, and you know what, Bill Burton by the way, who is Obama's press secretary at the time, you got to listen to this, he said, I'm quoting, one of the great things about our democracy is that powerful members of government at high levels can disagree in public and in private and this is one of those instances.KELLY: Wow!WOHL: This is all it is, Megyn, he's got the First Amendment right.KELLY: Really, really?WOHL: It's frustrating him because I reviewed this case --KELLY: I reviewed this case too.  WOHL: It should have been dismissed a long --KELLY: No.WOHL: -- time ago on summary judgment motion no question about it.  KELLY: No, no. I mean, Ben is not a lawyer. David and I are lawyers. I completely disagree with you on that.  FERGUSON: No. Actually, I am a lawyer.  KELLY: Oh, I'm sorry, Ben, I didn't know that. And the court of appeals actually upheld this. It wasn't all this judge. Listen, you can say that there is no merits to the case. And Trump will get his day in court. But to go after the judge as a, quote, ""Mexican,"" and hater, takes it to a different level, Ben.  FERGUSON: Well, absolutely and the fact that Trump defenders have to rely on Barack Obama was a bad guy, therefore, if our guy does the exact same thing, it's just doubly as awesome --WOHL: No, that's not why.  FERGUSON: No, Trump campaign, I mean, okay so you tell me, David, why is it better that Trump did it now that Barack Obama did? I thought we were running against Barack Obama if were on the right -- I thought the idea was Obama is a bad guy.WOHL: No, the point is, the point is, you know what he said immediately after he said, I love the Mexican people, I've got millions of Mexican supporters. He clarified it. You know, don't take it out of context. The majority, Megyn --KELLY: I mention it because I want to take this opportunity to express my love for the Mexicans. Come on.WOHL: Megyn, you know what, sometimes you have a slip of the tongue and I submit to you --KELLY: He does it repeatedly! That's the thing that's so crazy about it.  I don't know why he's doing this. Listen, listen, nobody gives Trump a hard time. He says, I don't like this judge. I don't think he's been fair to me. I'm going to get my day in court. I'm going to win this case.  Great, go for it. That's fine.(CROSSTALK)What we're debating here is his taking it a step further, personalizing it, going after the guy's ethnicity and he does it every time.WOHL: You know something, Megyn, he is a member -- maybe he misconstrued that membership in the La Raza Lawyers Association. I don't know. A lot of people have gone after him because of his border policy. I don't know whether he felt this judge should recuse himself because of those issues.KELLY: He doesn't need to recuse himself.(CROSSTALK)There is no basic for the judge to recuse himself. This is what he does.  He creates a phase, he creates a bias, non-exist, and then demands the person be removed --WOHL: No, no, no. Megyn right after Donald Trump -- right after Mr. Trump complained last week about the judge, the judge releases the document immediately thereafter. Now, I submit to you, does that create an appearance of impropriety? It may well do so. And if he doesn't recuse himself, and maybe up to Mr. Trump's lawyers to file the motion for recusal with the different judge --FERGUSON: All right, so basically you insult the judge and then when the judge does something that he's perfectly allowed to do under the law and there's a motion before the court in order to release these documents.  Then you say he has to recuse himself. So you create the issue and then --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Hold on, let Ben finish.  FERGUSON: Okay, so you create the issue and then the only solution is for Trump to get what he wants? And by the way, there's a whole slip of the tongue nonsense. When your tongue keeps slipping in the same direction, in a certain point, you sort of have to figure that there's a little bit of intentionality to it. The guy's tongue is a slip and slide he doesn't just slip every so often.  KELLY: Okay --(LAUGHTER)I leave you at home with that mental image. Great debate, guys. Thanks for being here.WOHL: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: So, with Trump now having enough delegates to be the Republican nominee, there are new questions about what that means for other Republican races and whether this man will still be the Senate Majority Leader come next January. Senator Mitch McConnell joins us next.Plus, one of America's best-loved journalists is being accused of deceptive editing to make gun groups look bad. Brit Hume is here on the Katie Couric controversy.And then THE KELLY FILE exclusive. Your first look at a new Dinesh D'Souza documentary on Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What if the goal of the Democratic Party is to steal the most valuable thing the world has ever produced. What if their plan is to steal America?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Breaking tonight, with Donald Trump all but locked in now as the Republican nominee, there is a growing debate about what this means for other Republican races particularly in the U.S. Senate. Twenty four of the 54 Republican Senate seats are up for grabs and will share the ballot in November with Trump. And some media outlets are suggesting that's a problem for Republicans. From ""USA Today,"" ""down ballot GOP candidates fear Trump shipwreck."" And from ""The Washington Post,"" want to see a GOP senator duck and run? Ask about Trump. The folks at the week made their conclusion obvious when they wrote, why Donald Trump will doom Republicans' Senate majority.Joining me now, the majority leader of the Republican-controlled Senate Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. He has a new book out which is called ""The Long Game"" and it's fascinating. We'll get to that in a minute. Great to see you, thank you for being here.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., MAJORITY LEADER: So your take on that, disastrous predictions down ballot if Trump, when Trump is the nominee in November?I don't think so. I mean, regardless of what happens at the top of the ticket. You have two nominees here who we know for sure are very unpopular. And so, I think neither one of them can count on a kind of Barack Obama 2008 landslide in which your party sweeps the House and the Senate. And everybody is saying, not only we are going to elect your president, but we want you to do anything you want to.  KELLY: No one is getting a mandate?MCCONNELL: I don't think so. This is going to be a ticket -- we do have a lot of exposure, as you pointed out, 24 members up and only 10 Democrats.  But they're very popular incumbents. People like Kelly Ayotte and Toomey and Rob Portman and others.KELLY: Now what about -- let's talk about what's on the Senate agenda going forward, which is the number one thing you hear people talk about when they support Donald Trump when they really don't like Donald Trump.MCCONNELL: Uh-hm.KELLY: Supreme Court vacancies. Because when it comes down to what you're talking about, a legacy appointments situation already with the Scalia seat. You have said that you're not even going to give Merrick Garland a look if it's clear, you know, let's say leading up to November, Hillary is, you know, prevailing over Trump or let's say it's lame duck and she's already won, you're not going to give Merrick Garland a hearing if she's already won?MCCONNELL: Right.KELLY: Come on!MCCONNELL: Here's the point, here's the point. We're in the middle of a presidential election year. No vacancy on the Supreme Court occurring in the middle of a presidential election year has been filled in 80 years.  You had to go back to 1888, go over Cleveland in the White House to find the last time a Senate --KELLY: You could have gone back to --MCCONNELL: No, no, no. Look, this is about the principle. Does Barack Obama get to fill the seat, tipping the court to the left, for the next generation?KELLY: What if she's the president-elect?MCCONNELL: Let me finish, on the way out the door, a lame duck? No. Let the American people speak. Let them decide who they want to make this appointment. Look, there's no chance that if Hillary Clinton's elected she'll pick anybody to the right of Merrick Garland. He's not a moderate.  Barack Obama declaring someone a moderate doesn't make him a moderate. So, you're going to get a liberal Supreme Court nominee if Hillary Clinton wins. That's what we got with Barack Obama.KELLY: So you're ready for that?MCCONNELL: If Trump wins, if Trump wins, he's already put out a list of people that I think are outstanding, currently serving in the federal judiciary. That's the kind of person he's appoint, that reason alone is -- determines support.  KELLY: Now, let's talk about the book a bit, ""The Long Game,"" it's a memoir, talking about your childhood battle with polio. Your failure to excel in baseball which sent you into the student council and would up -- and you running the U.S. Senate, and how Roger Ailes, our boss here at Fox News, was really responsible for your entire political career. How is that?  MCCONNELL: Well, the most competitive guy I've ever known and you see that here at Fox. Without his creativity, he was doing the commercials in my first long shot race. Here's the situation. It was July. The election was in November. I was 30 points behind. We had a strategy meeting and I said, Roger, is anybody this far behind this late ever won? And he said, not that I can recall.(LAUGHTER)But he was so competitive. I said, is it over? He said, no. And so we came up with kind of a needle in the haystack issue. My opponent was missing votes on the floor of the Senate to make speeches for money. Roger created this -- what we call bloodhound ads which had a bunch of hounds with the hunter out looking for (INAUDIBLE) to try to get him back to work.  It captured the imagination of people in my state. They started laughing.  It woke the race up. And I ended up winning by one vote a precinct.KELLY: Oh, wow!MCCONNELL: One vote a precinct.KELLY: That is all you need.MCCONNELL: What is even more remarkable, that was the day of the Reagan sweep. He was carrying 49 out of 50 states where he lost his seats in the Senate. And the guy Roger Ailes helped me defeat was the only Democratic incumbent U.S. senator and the whole country to lose that day.KELLY: How about that?MCCONNELL: So, I do indeed owe my first Senate race to Roger Ailes.KELLY: Wow!MCCONNELL: Without him, I'd be practicing law in Louisville, Kentucky.  KELLY: Well, I wouldn't be too bad either. I mean, especially --MCCONNELL: Not as good as this.KELLY: Given the approval rating that you see as members of Congress, you know, who knows? But --MCCONNELL: Well, lawyers don't rate that high either.  KELLY: I feel like you.(LAUGHTER)Great to see you, sir. Good luck.MCCONNELL: Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY: My pleasure.Well, media outlets are now attacking Donald Trump for how he treated reporters at his news conference today. Brit Hume has some thoughts on that, next.  Plus, there's now a criminal investigation into the parents of the four- year-old who fell into that gorilla pen at the Cincinnati zoo. Mark and Arthur will weigh in on what happens when something bad happens to your family.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: Breaking tonight, new reaction to Donald Trump's combative news conference at Trump Tower today. As we told you earlier, Mr. Trump defended his handling of donations to veterans. But then he turned his fire on the media and did not hold back, calling out reporters who were sitting just feet away from him. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You know my opinion of the media, it's very low. I think the media is, frankly, made up of people that in many cases, not in all cases, are not good people. I didn't want the credit for it, but it was very unfair that the press treated us so badly.Yeah, go ahead. I like scrutiny but you know what when I raised money -- excuse me, excuse me, I've watched you on television, you're a real beauty, but what I don't want is when I raised millions of dollars, have people say, like this sleazy guy right over here from ABC, he's a sleaze in my book.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why am I?TRUMP: You're a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this what it is going to be like with you as a president?TRUMP: Yeah, it is.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Brit Hume is our Fox News senior political analyst. Brit, good to see you so, you know, did Trump basically say this is who I am, get used to it?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, the one who's going to have to get used to eventually is Trump himself if he gets elected because this scrutiny of the donations he claimed on the very night of the event, that was back in January, remember, he said on that night that he had already raised $6 million.And then later on, he said it again. And he said it as kind of an applause (ph) line at that event. So for him to say, as he did today, that well, he wasn't seeking credit for it, well he certainly took credit for it on that first night.KELLY: We have that. Let's show the viewers what you're trying to say. Now, today he says he never wanted credit for raising this money. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If the press writes false stories like they did where I wanted to keep a low profile. I didn't want the credit for raising all this money for the vets. I wasn't looking for the credit. And by the way, more money is coming in. I wasn't looking for the credit, but I had no choice but to do this because the press was saying I didn't raise any money for them.We held something, in lieu of the debate, I said let's have a rally for the veterans. We raised in one hour $6 million. Is that good?We raised in one hour, listen to this one, $6 million. Okay.(Applause)Just one thing on the vets, during the last debate, I raised $6 million for the vets, and I will tell you something --(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: Well, there you go. He did took credit in that last sound clip. He said ""I raised $6 million"" so, he clearly did take credit for it. And then of course it didn't appear for a time that anybody could really account for that, including the Trump campaign, which had difficulty saying where the money was, how much actually had been raised. And now finally today we got a pretty full accounting of how much money there was.It wasn't $6 million, at least not yet, although it might become that large a number, and he said -- set forth all the directions in which the money had been sent, which all appears so far to be noted on the up and up. Why he would be so angry about people raising questions about a claim that he made, it strikes me -- this is what journalists do. This is what journalist -- this is what biased journalist do.KELLY: He just said (ph) with his counter punching and yet...HUME: This is what -- yeah, I understand but...KELLY: This is part of the job.HUME: This is what we do. This is what we do Megyn. Biased journalists do this. Unbiased journalists do this. All journalists do this. We are professional skeptics. We ask questions about the claims that politicians make. He mad a claim, questions were raised and he got his nose (ph) how to join to the (inaudible), just calling out reporters by name, calling them names in a way that I've never seen a presidential candidate do in my memory.We know that behind the scenes presidents and presidential candidates fume about media coverage. They all do it and they always have. But you rarely see it shown in this public way, by someone who is obvious, takes it all so personally. And if he goes at -- if he has that frame of mind as president, he will have a terribly hard time.KELLY: You say professional skeptics. I call us cynical mofos. You know, six one way, half a dozen the other. I want to ask you speaking of the press, Katie Couric's in a middle of controversy. Her documentary ""Under the Gun"" has been found to have had some selective editing in it.She came out and said she regrets it now, that it was misleading and she didn't raise her concerns more vigorously. Why has this turned in to such a deal?HUME: Well, because she waited so long. When you see what the documentary showed, which was a question posed by her to a group of the people she was doing this about, and they -- the gun rights advocates -- and they sit there as far as the documentary showed in stony silence apparently, stumped by her question. That didn't happen. This wasn't a matter of saying being edited out. It was what was edited in, it was the silence.There were immediate responses from a number of the people present to her question and the documentary, that piece of the documentary was a falsehood, and at first, she defended it. Why or how she could defend it, I don't know, I don't understand that. I've known her a long time. I've known her since -- when she first got her start at ABC news, it was years ago. I can't understand it.But what that did was it fed the controversy, which then dragged on for days. Until now, finally, she properly apologized for what happened, which was pretty blatant piece of editing. Or insertion, I should say.KELLY: Yeah, and now they're admitting it that it was inserted after the fact. Brit, good to see you.HUME: Thanks Megyn.KELLY: So, big news today and a possible third party run for the White House. And ""The Kelly File"" just spoke to the possible candidate himself. That's just ahead. Plus a ""Kelly File"" exclusive when we unveil a sneak peek of a new documentary about Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. And filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza is next with that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Democrats went from slavery to enslavement.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Corrupt big city bosses, that's how you get corrupt unions.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is progressive actually mean?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Social engineering and social control.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, the rumors are confirmed. Weekly Standard founder Bill Kristol is eyeing constitutional lawyer David French as a possible third party alternative to Donald Trump. Moments ago, our team spoke to Mr. French. The writer is choosing to maintain a low profile by politely declining our request for an interview. But he did offer us the names of several people we should speak to who could speak for him. We'll pick up that part of the story tomorrow night right here on ""The Kelly File.""So, Dinesh D'Souza is known for statement making documentaries that deliver a jolt of controversy during key moments of a political campaign and his latest project is no exception. In ""Hillary's America,"" D'Souza sets out to expose Hillary Clinton's motives by examining what he says is the history of her progressive politics. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DINESH D'SOUZA, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Who are these democrats?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is my judgment...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dinesh D'Souza was sentenced on Tuesday to spend eight months in a confinement center.D'SOUZA: It all began when the Obama administration tried to shut me up.(Inaudible)D'SOUZA: What did i learn? All crime is about stealing. The big criminals are still at large.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: ...see any reason to keep him.D'SOUZA: The system doesn't go after them because they run the system. It's time to go behind the curtain and discover the soul of the Democratic Party.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fifty lashes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Screaming).UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The democrat supports slaves.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This civil rights act will allow colored men to sit at the same table beside the white guests.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How many (ph) old Democrats.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ku Klux Klan.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To the democratic party --D'SOUZA: Why has all this been swept under the rug?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To cover the tracks of the Democratic Party.D'SOUZA: And we're not even talking about ancient history.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The racism continued well into the 20th century.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As long as the black man continues to ravage our white women, we will continue to lynch him.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got to give them a little something.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Plantation politics.D'SOUZA: The democrats went from slavery to enslavement.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Corrupt big city bosses. That's how you get corruption unions.D'SOUZA: What is progressive actually mean?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Social engineering and social control.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ...and a large family does wanted its members is secure it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The opening video of the Democratic Convention of 2012.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The government is the one thing we all belong to.D'SOUZA: No, government belongs to us. We don't belong to it.D'SOUZA: What are these democrats hiding?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is about buying and selling influence by foreign oligarchs and foreign governments. When you follow the money, there are very, very few coincidence.D'SOUZA: What if the goal of the Democratic Party is to steal the most valuable thing the world has ever produced? What if their plan is to steal America? Who will stop them now?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Oh, my. So he's a fan of Hillary's and joining me now to discuss it is the film's creator and executive producer Dinesh D'Souza. Dinesh good to -- so, you know, sure you're open-minded. She might still get your vote is what you're saying?D'SOUZA: Well, in my Obama film four years ago, I focused just on Obama because he was an unknown guy. No one knew much about him. In this film, we focus on Hillary to be sure, but we also focus on the whole history of progressivism and the Democratic Party. So we're telling an unknown story of American politics. And it's going to roil up this race, I'll tell you that.KELLY: This is a point that we hear made fairly often about the Democrat's history when it comes to race issues in particular and one that doesn't get, you know, that much of a spotlight. But today, you know, if you listen to folks today, it's the Republicans. The Republicans are the racist party that's against blacks and the Democrats are the opposite.D'SOUZA: Yeah, and I think this is going to be the attack on Trump. He's a racist, he's a sexist, he's a xenophobe, he hates immigrants, et cetera. I think it's very important for people to know that the Democratic Party historically has been the party of slavery, of segregation, of Jim Crow, of lynching, of the Ku Klux Klan, forced sterilization, support for fascism, the interment of the Japanese after World War II.I mean, it's an unbelievably sordid history and it's been somehow all swept under the rug. It's all been covered up and the blame has now switched to the very party, the Republicans, who fought to end slavery, who opposed segregation, who proposed anti-lynching laws throughout the 20th century. So, there's an unbelievable inversion that's gone on and our film blows the lid on it.KELLY: But in today's America where Republicans don't tend to support affirmative action and don't want, you know, certain civil rights laws to be extended, that's, you know, that's what the other side uses to tar them with the, you know, racist accusation among other things.D'SOUZA: Yeah, you know, Megyn, as late as the civil rights movement of the '60s, the civil rights movement would never have gone through without Republican support. More Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Bill of 1968, the Democrats. The main opposition to civil rights came from Democrats and this, too, has been part of the history that most Americans don't know.KELLY: Its fascinating Dinesh. We talked the last time you were here about your suggestive (ph) that they tried to shut you up and that the criminals -- the big criminals were still at large right after you got out of the overnight confinement, which is worth your while. We post that on facebook.com so people can see it. It's always a pleasure, sir, good to see you, and congratulations on your marriage.D'SOUZA: Thank you.KELLY: Is it true Ted Cruz's dad married you two?D'SOUZA: He did, yes. He did the ceremony for us so we're thrilled about that.KELLY: So confused, very confused, but congratulations. Best wishes to you and your wife.D'SOUZA: Thank you.KELLY: This is a little tease for later, I'll find out why. Up next, Mike and Arthur on the controversy over a young boy, a rare gorilla, a tragic incident and questions of responsibility. Arthur (ph) when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: A holiday weekend incident at the Cincinnati Zoo is raising serious questions about responsibility. These parents had to look on helplessly when their 4-year-old son fell into the gorilla exhibit. A rare gorilla then dragged the child around for nearly ten minutes. Worried the boy's life was in danger, a zoo keeper shot and killed the gorilla and touched off a national debate.Mike Eiglarsh, is a criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor Arthur Aidala has the same pedigree. They're with me now. So, now they are confirming, the prosecutor, that the incident is under investigation. What they are considering is whether the parents and the family of the child should face any criminal charges. Mark, should they?MARK EIGLARSH, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Absolutely not. Listen, this was a tragedy and unless there's evidence of them hoisting their child over the protective wall saying, ""Go have fun. Mama wants you to go play with the gorilla,"" then you don't bring criminal charges. Civil responsibility, maybe, not criminal charges.KELLY: Arthur?ARTHUR AIDALA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, there's something you call ""res ipsa loquitur"" which means ""that thing speaks for itself."" So, if a 3- year-old is able to get into the gorilla area, obviously there was some negligence there. Obviously it wasn't good enough. I mean, if the kid could do it...EIGLARSH: Negligence on whose part, Arthur?AIDALA: On the zoo.EIGLARSH: On the zoo or the parents?AIDALA: If a 3-year-old could get in there unassisted by an adult, obviously somebody did something wrong.KELLY: Do you think the parents should sue the zoo.AIDALA: I'm not saying the parents should sue the zoo. I think that -- I don't think anybody should sue anybody. How about that? How about the law doesn't always have to get involved with all of these issues? An investigation needs to be done so that it doesn't happen again.EIGLARSH: I agree with Arthur.KELLY: Well change.org -- well, the change.org petition calling for the boy's parents to be held accountable for their actions of not supervising him, has over 100,000 signatures, Mark.EIGLARSH: Megyn, what parent hasn't gone through the horror of temporarily losing their child for a second or two? I talked to my mother tonight and she said she lost my kids at Disney World. I learned that for the first time. It happens, Megyn.KELLY: Yeah.EIFLARSH: It does. It doesn't mean you're a bad parent or should be stripped of your liberty like Arthur is suggesting.KELLY: People are upset that this gorilla was shot, this 17-year-old silverback gorilla...AIDALA: I am. Everyone is.KELLY: ...endangered species was shot. He didn't do anything wrong. They don't think they had to use, you know, a fatal shot on him.EIGLARSH: They don't know what they're talking about.AIDALA: Unless the kid was injured, if that gorilla would take less than one second to kill that child, even unintentionally. You had no choice in those circumstances. It stinks. It's horrible.KELLY: Go ahead, Mark.EIGLARSH: It would have taken 10 minutes for the tranquillizer to work. It doesn't work like you see on television. If that was anyone's child, they would have wanted that gorilla gone...KELLY: But people are pointing to an incident in 1986 at the Jersey zoo, a 5-year-old boy fell into the gorilla enclosure, broke his arm, fractured his skull, but the gorilla stroked his back until he was brought to safety.AIDALA: And who's willing to take that chance with their child? What human being who's a parent of a 3-year-old is going to say, ""Let's give it a shot and see what happens."" I'm sorry, as a parent, you're going to want to do whatever you got to do to save your own kid.EIGLARSH: Of course.KELLY: Do you think, Mark that this family will sue the zoo? Because you know some lawyer is going to call them up and tell them they should.EIGLARSH: Absolutely not. And then the zoo then will counter sue saying, ""Listen, had you not watched your child"" -- they're both going to g away and learn their lesson and raise their level of awareness.AIDALA: I mean, they have so much money -- I think Mark's right. They would tell the -- do you know how much money the zoo is going to lose by not having this attraction there? The gorilla was a big attraction, 17-year- old, beautiful, beautiful animal. That was a main viewing point for people at the zoo.KELLY: So sad.AIDALA: Horrible.EIGLARSH: It is.KELLY: You got to watch them every moment. Guys, good to see you both. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So Ben Shapiro is so smart, how smart is he? He graduated summa cum laude from UCLA then went to Harvard and graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School and did practice law -- my apologies again to him. Summa cum laude, cum laude, the radio's too laude. Name that movie.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

I will tell that Ben Carson does not have the aptitude to bring jobs back, does not have the aptitude to deal with China, Japan, Mexico, and any other country you can name. Just doesn't have it, it's not his.CECILY STRONG, 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE': Because of equal time rules for television, Mr. Trump can only speak for four seconds in this promo.TRUMP: So let me just say this -- Ben Carson is a complete and total loser.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: OK, Donald Trump in New Hampshire and in the ""Saturday Night Live"" promo, one of many he's done. We have some new FOX News polls as reported at the beginning of the program. And take a look -- Donald Trump up two points since October, now leading, obviously within the margin of error, over Dr. Ben Carson. But you see Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio also moving up, Jeb Bush dropping down. And you see the rest of the field.If you add the second choice, there you see an interesting list. Ben Carson, first and second choice combined leads, Trump still up there, Rubio next. Take a look at two other polls before I bring in the panel. Most qualified to handle the question, look at this poll, 42 percent, Donald Trump. GOP candidate most qualified to be commander-in-chief, Donald Trump, 19 percent, Ben Carson, 17. And you see the rest.With that, let's bring in the panel, Jason Riley, columnist with the ""Wall Street Journal,"" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of ""The Hill,"" and Robert Costa, National political reporter for the ""Washington Post."" Bob, welcome. You look at that and you look at what's happening on the trail, what do you think about Donald Trump and Ben Carson? They seem to be up above the rest.ROBERT COSTA, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, ""WASHINGTON POST"": The outsider wave that's been surging all year shows no signs of receding. Trump and Carson continue to lead nationally. You have seen some strong momentum coming out of the last debate for Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio, and I think many in the Republican establishment are looking especially at Rubio as someone who can come around the corner and be their contender.BAIER: A.B., I'm sure in the next few days we're going to hear this poll cited -- qualified to handle the economy, 42 percent say Donald Trump. This is 1,230 voters, this is Republican primary voters, there is a margin of error, 4.5 percent, but this is such a huge lead.A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, ""THE HILL"": I think that he's going to remind the kindly doctor that he beats him by 33 points on handling the economy. The doctor is behind Cruz. And also he beats him on 19 points on who can best beat Hillary Clinton in a general election.And the commander-in-chief numbers are only two points apart. And in polling, the general poll they're very tight. I think those numbers are going to be bragging rights for Donald Trump. And, again, he's, he he's behind him in national polls, but this is a good poll for Donald Trump.BAIER: Top issue, let's go to that. FOX News poll four, and facing the country. Deficit government spending at 36 percent, jobs, unemployment, there you see it, and not much of a change from September, but on that issue of the economy, obviously it drives the day.JASON RILEY, ""WALL STREET JOURNAL"": Yes, it does drive the day. And you'd expect that. That's been the big story of the Obama administration, where are the jobs. A lot of people and of course the employment rate doesn't really reflect, who's not looking for work anymore, or who's looking for work part time but would rather be working full time.So I'm a little surprised that Trump has decided to set aside Ben Carson right now because one of the things this poll shows is Carson's likeability versus Trump. And there Donald Trump is getting creamed by Carson. So that's a little -- I'm not sure that -- that seems very short sighted for him to go there.I think the other thing that struck me about the poll, Bret, is that Jeb Bush has fallen off the cliff here. He is no longer a top tier contender. And it will be interesting to see if the mainstream media coverage reflects that going forward, because the people at the top of that poll whether we're talking about Carson or Trump or Cruz are people that the mainstream media typically likes to condescend to. It will be interesting to see if they treat them as top-tier candidates as they are right now in this race.BAIER: I'll tell you, Bob, you look at the Jeb Bush campaign, they're in their third iteration of a restart. And there are more and more questions about are you getting out. He's obviously pushing back hard against that. But you look at these falling poll numbers. What is your sense of where the Bush is right now?COSTA: I've called around Bush's allies. And they say remember, he's a Bush. He has presidential politics in his blood. So this idea that he's going to quit, they say that doesn't really ring true.But Bush has a difficult proposition ahead of him. How does he win New Hampshire? It's crowded right now up there in the granite state. You have Senator Rubio, Senator Cruz, Governor Kasich, Governor Christie. If you want to be a center-right candidate who gets a bounce out of New Hampshire, that's what Bush wants. For now the field is very crowded.BAIER: I want to look at FOX poll 11, this is honest and trustworthy. It has all of the candidates, Democrat and Republican and how they stack up against each other. Leading in honest and trustworthy, Ben Carson, plus 34. There you see yes and no. You can see all of the other candidates. Sanders is second in the plus column, and there you see Clinton in the bottom in the honest and trustworthy, kind of upside down, right behind Donald Trump. What do you think of that poll?STODDARD: Well, this affirms what was found in the NBC/""Wall Street Journal"" poll out earlier this week. Clinton's numbers, even after her Benghazi testimony on honest and trustworthy are terrible. They're 36-60, the worst of any candidate. And those aren't getting better. She's a known quantity. It will be very hard for her to earn credibility and high marks on character and trustworthiness when she's so known and she remains under FBI investigation. Trump continues to succeed in these polls despite the fact that his numbers are pretty bad as well.BAIER: I do want to play one more sound bite from Donald Trump talking about Marco Rubio and then Rubio's response and how that plays.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Marco Rubio has a disaster on his finances. He has a disaster on his credit cards. When you check his credit cards, take a look at what he's done with the Republican Party when he had access, what he had to put back in, and whether or not something should have happened. You'll understand it. Marco Rubio has a basic disaster on finance. So let's see what you find. Let's see what kind of a reporter you are. OK? Good luck.(APPLAUSE)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't know what he's talking about. I don't have any debt in the world except my mortgage on our home. He always gets weird whenever his poll numbers go down. He goes off a little bit. So I guess that's what's happening.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: What about that tactic?RILEY: I think he's taking shots at these other guys. But I think the campaign is most concerned about Ted Cruz.BAIER: The Trump campaign.RILEY: The Trump campaign. I think that long-term is the person who could hurt him most. Carson's numbers have come up, but they haven't come up at Trump's expense. Trump has really maintained pretty level over, you know, throughout the summer. He's still pretty much where he's been in the mid-20s.I think, and what I think is happening in the campaign is you're going to see the other voters, the other side is consolidating around an anti- establishment candidate. And if Trump isn't their guy, the most likely person it could be is Ted Cruz. So then the others will coalesce around an established candidate.BAIER: Bob, last thing. A lot of people get mad that we focus this much on polls this early. It is the marker by which we kind of measure where things are. Organization on the ground, you've been out there. Who is best organized?COSTA: In terms of grassroots fervor and organization on the ground, you have to look to Trump and Carson. I've seen their operations in Iowa. Trump has Rick Santorum's former strategist working on his side in the Hawkeye state. And you see Carson, the enthusiasm for him is letting him have this network grow almost organically. Bush has a great operation in South Carolina, Rubio as well down there. It's pretty competitive all-around.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN HOLDREN, WHITE HOUSE SCIENCE ADVISER: The single most important bottom line that shines through all these hundreds of pages is that climate change is not a distant threat. It is something that is happening now. It is affecting the American people now in important ways.MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: The president also knows that much of the pain of imposing such regulations would be borne by our own middle class. That's why this discussion has become so cynical, and it's part of the reasons the president's own party couldn't even pass a national energy tax when it had complete control of Washington's Congress back in 2009 and 2010. The American people weren't willing to go along with considerable domestic pain for negligible global gain back then. It's foolish to think they'd assent to a bad idea now.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: An 800-page report released by the White House today. The president talking to local and national weather forecasters to stress the urgency of dealing with climate change. And there you see the pushback from the Senate Minority Leader on the floor.Let's bring in our panel, syndicated columnist George Will, Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: What they tell you is that you should be scared about what's happening today. Of course, if it's very cold in the winter, they blame it, here in the northeast, they blame it on global warming, and the report says that global warming makes summers hotter and winters are generally shorter and warmer. Any scientific theory that explains everything explains nothing, and no matters what happens in climate is unpleasant, the word for that is weather, it's attributed to global warming. If we continue global warming up here in the northeast we're going to freeze to death.But the most important element is what McConnell was talking about, the negligible gains. Assume they are right about global warming, assume that it is all caused by man. The United States has reduced carbon emissions since 2006 more than any other country on earth. We are right now at 1992 levels according to the International Energy Agency, and yet carbon emissions have gone up globally. Why? We don't control the emissions of the other 96 percent of humanity, especially China and India.  As we dismantle the coal plants in our country, China and India together are adding one coal fired plant every week. The net effect is to shift the U.S. coal energy generating industry from here to India and China. It will have zero effect.If we could have a pact with other countries in which everybody would reduce their emissions, I would sign on. In the absence of it, all that we're doing is committing economic suicide in the name of do-goodism that will not do an iota of good.BAIER: Mara?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, first of all, it's not clear, as Mitch McConnell suggested, that President Obama wants to put on a national energy tax. I don't think he's proposing that. But he is going to propose a new set of regulations. The EPA is going to come out with that.BAIER: Is the first part of the statement accurate, though? Obviously, he controlled both --LIASSON: Yes. He certainly couldn't do it back then, and he's not suggesting it now, though. But yes, he couldn't do it back then, and cap and trade went nowhere even though some Republicans were for it, including John McCain at one point.But I think the Republicans have to decide whether they want to say this isn't a problem or it is a problem but we shouldn't do anything unless China and developing countries are also on board. Eventually, this problem has to be dealt with. I think the science is pretty overwhelming now. It is real. It's climate change. It's not just global warming. It's extreme weather all over the place. And it is costing a lot of money and making a lot of changes. And we have to decide whether we're going to mitigate it or try to just adapt to it and live with it.BAIER: George?BAIER: There is, however, no evidence for the increase in extreme weather. I own a home on an island in South Carolina looking south in the direction of hurricanes, and after Katrina I was really interested when they said this is a harbinger of increased hurricane activity, which since then has plummeted. Now, Mr. Holdren, who introduced this report, has his own record of very interesting failed forecasts, not to mention Al Gore, who in 2008 said by 2013, for those of you keeping score at home that's last year, the ice cap in the North Pole would be gone. It's not.Now, there is, as Charles says, the policy question is how much wealth do we want to spend directly or in lost production in order to have no discernible measurable effect on the climate? People say well, what about this report? There is a sociology of science. Scientists are not saints in white laboratory smocks. They have got interests like everybody else. If you want a tenure track position in academia, don't question the reigning orthodoxy on climate change. If you want money from the biggest source of direct research in this country, the federal government, don't question it's orthodoxy. If you want to get along with your peers, conform to peer pressure. This is what's happening.BAIER: So you don't buy that 97 percent of scientists who studied the issue --WILL: Who measured it? Where did that figure come from? They pluck these things from the ether. I do not. The New Yorker magazine, which is impeccably upset about climate change, recently spoke about the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as ""the last word on climate change."" Now, try that phrase, ""the last word on microbiology, quantum mechanics, physics, chemistry."" Since when does science come to the end?  The New Yorker has discovered the end of this. Who else has?BAIER: The climate assessment today said this, ""Americans,"" as Charles referenced, ""Americans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter, winters are generally shorter and warmer."" Now, this White House put out a statement just a week and a half ago, last week, saying about the GDP, the first quarter of 2014 was marked by unusually severe winter weather including record cold temperatures and snowstorms which explains part of the difference in the GDP growth relative to previous quarters."" Jay Carney was asked about all of this. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The impacts of climate change on weather are severe in both directions. The fact that the severe winter that much of the country endured had an impact on GDP it wasn't an assessment that we here alone made, but economists independent on the outside made and that nobody disagrees with.The fact is that no single weather event can be attributed to climate change. There is an inclination upon some to doubt the science despite the overwhelming evidence and the overwhelming percentage in the 97 percent range of scientists who study this issue who agree that climate change is real and that it is the result of human activity.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: 99 percent of physicists convinced that space and time were fixed until Einstein working in a patent office wrote a paper in which he showed that they are not. I'm not impressed by numbers. I'm not impressed by consensus. When I was a psychiatrist I participated in consensus conferences on how to define depression and mania. These are things that people negotiate in the way you would negotiate a bill, because the science is unstable, because in the case of climate the models are changeable and because climate is so complicated.The idea that we who have trouble forecasting what's going to happen on Saturday in the climate could pretend to be predicting what's going to happen in 30, 40 years, is absurd. And you always see that no matter what happens, whether it's a flood or it's a drought, whether it's one -- it's warming or cooling, it's always a result of what is ultimately what we're talking about here, human sin with the pollution of carbon. It's the oldest superstition around. It was in the Old Testament. It's in the rain dance of the Native Americans. If you sin, the skies will not cooperate.  This is quite superstitious, and I'm waiting for science which doesn't declare itself definitive but is otherwise convincing.BAIER: OK, Mara, let's talk about the politics of this. Clearly, it fits into the White House push, but what about 2014, 2016?LIASSON: I think that what would be the best politics perhaps would be to go ahead and push this. He's been doing this for years, and approve the Keystone pipeline. You know, in the past, the White House has believed that the Keystone pipeline was a side show. It doesn't affect global warming. There are a lot of Democrats, a good handful of red state incumbents would like the Keystone pipeline to be approved, and then he can focus on what he thinks is really important, which is this bigger climate change.BAIER: There are a few things they think are side shows. George?WILL: A moment ago we had a report here on our crumbling infrastructure, gave it a D, emergency. Who wrote it? As we said on there it was written by civil engineers, who said, by golly, we need more of what civil engineers do and are paid to do. Again, there is a sociology of science, there is a sociology in all of this, and engaging the politics of this, we have to understand the enormous interests now invested in climate change.LIASSON: On both sides.WILL: Sure.LIASSON: The fossil fuel industry has a big interest and you say environmentalists have an interest.WILL: It pales in comparison to the money flowing from the federal government.BAIER: Next up, violence heats up again in Eastern Ukraine as the policy debate heats up on Capitol Hill.
