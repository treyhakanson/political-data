1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/11/04/bill-oreilly-midterm-election/	Bill O'Reilly: The midterm election	"It's is very important obviously because America is not doing real well at the moment. ""Talking Points"" does not endorse political candidates because if I say vote for this one, three days later that person could be indicted. But the real reason I don't get involved with partisan politics is because it's my job to keep an eye on all the powerful people in America. If I have a rooting interest, that could skew my mandate. So I don't support political candidates. I never tell anyone for whom I vote and I try to keep it fair down the line.That being said, there is no question the Obama administration is having trouble almost everywhere, every fair minded person knows that. The President cannot even campaign for Democratic candidates because most of them felt he would be a detriment. When Mr. Obama did get out on the trail, he said things like this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: The Republicans are blocking immigration reform. That's one more reason why we need a Democratic senate. So I support you. I'm with you. I'm with you. And you need to go protest the Republicans.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Do we have a Democratic senate now? Doesn't make any sense. And why would anyone protest the GOP when the Democratic Party holds power? It's clear President Obama's economic policies have not helped working Americans. The key indicator, your take-home pay has gone down since he's been in office. President Obama and the Democratic Party believe the federal government should essentially run the economy. The President and Congress have poured nearly $1 trillion tax payer dollars into the marketplace and all we have to show for it is a two percent growth rate per year on average -- two percent. It's simple the feds can't run the private economy it's not working. And that is a Democratic philosophy big government many regulations, high taxation. Again it's not working.Overseas things are a mess. We don't have to go through Putin, ISIS, Iran or any other problems again. U.S. foreign policy is in disarray. Finally the most important thing for the future, education, also not doing well. According to Cato Institute spending on American students is more than double since 1970 to almost $13,000 per student each year among the highest spending in the world. But SAT scores have declined three percent since the 1970's. Spending does not translate into good education. Discipline does. Both teacher and students must be held accountable in the classroom. By and large, the Democratic Party opposes that policy.Now there is little I can say about the Republican Party because there's no cohesive message the battle between conservatives and moderates continues to rage the GOP has no visible leadership, no unity and a terrible image among minority voters. But the failure of the Democratic Party overrides the inertia -- word of the day inertia -- of the Republican Party. That is why the GOP is favored to win tomorrow. And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

Rand Paul fires back at Donald Trump's jabs	"This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" August 9, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.In the wake of the big FOX News debate, where does the race for the GOP presidential nomination stand now?(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When you're sitting in a subcommittee blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that.SEN. RAND PAUL, R-K.Y., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't trust President Obama with our records. If you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead.JEB BUSH, R , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to have to earn this. Maybe the bar is higher for me.WALLACE: We'll talk to two candidates who were on the stage in Cleveland.Carly Fiorina, who's being praised as the big winner in the early debate.CARLY FIORINA, R , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I didn't get a phone call from bill Clinton before I jumped in the race. Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton? I didn't.WALLACE: And Senator Rand Paul, who was combative as he tries to reignite his campaign.Plus, Donald Trump makes a splash before he even utters a word.BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS MODERATOR: Raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight. Mr. Trump?WALLACE: Analysis from our Sunday group on the Trump factor, winners and losers and the new shape of the Republican race.All, right now, on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.Well, the sparks are still flying in the wake of the big FOX News debate that 24 million people tuned into see. Frontrunner Donald Trump is complaining about unfair treatment by the moderators, including me, and after Trump's personal comments about my colleague, Megyn Kelly, the conservative group RedState rescinded its invitation for him to speak at an event this weekend.The other top story is Carly Fiorina, who many declare the big winner after her standout performance during the early debate and I spoke with her earlier.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.FIORINA: Thank you so much for having me back, Chris.WALLACE: The consensus is you had a big night in Cleveland on Thursday. I know it's still early, but have you sensed a bump in support, a bump in money? And if so, how are you going to capitalize on it?FIORINA: Well, I do think it was a big night for me because going into that debate, only 40 percent of Republicans had heard my name believe it or not. I had extremely low name ID. And so, I think for many people this was the first time they saw, wow, there's another woman running for president and she's actually pretty good.So, we certainly have seen an uptick in financial support. We've seen an uptick in support generally and so, it's very exciting. I'm going to keep staying out there and talking to as many voters as I can about the issues I think our nation faces at this pivotal time and why I can win the job and why I can do the job.WALLACE: But there is a reason that you were on the early 5:00 p.m. debate, and we're going to put up the latest Real Clear Politics average of national polls and it shows that you were tied for 13th at 1.3 percent and even in the early states where you campaigned a lot, Iowa and New Hampshire, you were at 2 percent.And I think it's fair to say you have stood out at candidate forums and various events before, but it hasn't translated into voter support. Why is this going to be different?FIORINA: Well, I disagree with the premise of your question. I mean, I started my campaign on May 4th from a standing start. I didn't have years of email list. I'm not a professional politician. Most people never heard my name.National polls tend to measure name ID. And so, if you look at a number of state polls, we've been in the top ten in state polls but it hadn't yet translated into top ten in national polls.I would also remind you that at this time in previous presidential elections, the polls, pundits and money said that Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win and Barack Obama couldn't win.So, the truth is this race has just gotten started. And game on.WALLACE: You are one of the few candidates in the Republican field who is not afraid to take on Donald Trump. What do you think of the decision of the conservative group RedState to disinvite him from its gathering this weekend in Atlanta?FIORINA: You know, presidential campaigns are about watching someone under pressure and over time. And so, the debate that we were just talking about, you asked some tough questions, too. You talked to Donald Trump about his record of bankruptcy. I didn't notice Donald Trump insulting you for 24 hours. There's no excuse for this.WALLACE: No excuse for going after Megyn Kelly?FIORINA: No. It's her job to ask tough questions. It's your job to ask tough questions. And it's the candidate's job to answer those questions however they see fit.WALLACE: During your debate, you also talked about Donald Trump.Here's what you had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FIORINA: Since he's changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are principles by which he will govern?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: What is your message to the millions of people? And you know it, there are millions of people out there who like Donald Trump.FIORINA: You know, I've said many times that Donald Trump taps into an anger -- an anger with the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government and the professional political class.I agree with that anger. It's why I'm running for president, because honestly, no matter your issue, no matter your cause or festering problem you hoped would be resolved by now, the political class has failed you. And so, I understand that.And I firmly believe that we need a different kind of leadership now in the Oval Office that will actually challenge the status quo and get something done.WALLACE: Why are you the better person to do that than Trump? Because that seemed to be your argument.FIORINA: Because I don't think you get things done by insulting everyone. I have a track record of getting things done, of challenging the status quo, of leading toward results.I also understand how the economy works, how the world works and who's in it. How bureaucracies work, how to hold them accountable and cut them down to size. How technology works, how it can be used and how it's being used against us as a weapon.WALLACE: I want to pick up on that in a moment. You have also gone after Hillary Clinton throughout your campaign and once again in Cleveland on Thursday. Here you are.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FIORINA: Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e-mails, she's still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's front runner.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Why are you the best candidate to take on Hillary Clinton?FIORINA: Well, I think first of all, I will and have thrown every punch as I also said on Thursday night. This is going to be a fight in 2016, between conservatism and a Democrat Party that is undermining the character of this nation.We have to throw every punch we have. And the truth is, Hillary Clinton lacks a track record of accomplishment. She lacks a track record of leadership. And she is not trustworthy.WALLACE: Of course with more visibility comes more scrutiny and I don't think it was any surprise that the morning after your performance in the debate on Thursday, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, went after you. Here she is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, DNC CHAIR: What's impressive about a woman who nearly drove a Fortune 500 company into the ground, who fired 30,000 people when she was CEO, whose stock dropped by 50 percent when she was head of the company, and then recovered after she was fired by 10 percent.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: You know if you end up as Republican nominee, the Democrats are going to put that in every ad. She fired 30,000 people. It's exactly the kind of thing, Ms. Fiorina, that sunk Mitt Romney.FIORINA: Yes. And you know, I'm flattered that the head of DNC would come after me. I guess that means we're gaining traction here.But here's the facts: I led Hewlett-Packard through a very difficult time, the dotcom bust post-9/11, the worst technology recession in 25 years. I would remind Debbie Wasserman Schultz that it has taken the NASDAQ 15 years to recover.Sometimes in tough times, tough calls are necessary. However, we also took a company from $44 billion to almost $90 million. We quadrupled its growth rate, quadrupled its cash flow, tripled its innovation to 11 patents a day, and went from lagging behind to leading in every product category in every market segment.And yes, I was fired at the end of that, in a boardroom, which I've been very open about. And I was fired because when you challenge the status quo, which is what leadership is about, you make enemies.Steve Jobs was fired. Oprah Winfrey was fired. Walt Disney was fired. Mike Bloomberg was fired. I feel like I'm in good company.And we need somebody to challenge status quo of Washington, D.C. and get something done.WALLACE: But as a political reality because you know they're going to find, just as they did with Mitt Romney, they're going to find that poor unfortunate person who says, you know, Carly Fiorina went on and I lost my job.How are you going to be able to make that case and break through to voters in a way that Mitt Romney didn't?FIORINA: Well, there are lots of politicians who run for office and lost, too. That doesn't mean that all politicians lose. Not all business people are the same.But what I would argue is that there are a lot of people who understand as chief executive, there's nothing harder than saying to someone we don't have a job for you anymore. It's also true that the vast majority of Americans know that in tough times sometimes tough decisions have to be made. And what they're frustrated by is the federal government never makes a tough decision.WALLACE: All right.FIORINA: We have never succeeded in shrinking the size of government.So, let me tell you something else. We have a bunch of baby boomers who are going to retire out of the federal government over the next five to six years. I will not replace a single one.And yes, we need to actually get about the business of reducing the size, the power, the cost, complexity and corruption of this federal government.WALLACE: OK. And I want to pick up exactly on that issue, which is your experience as a CEO. What would President Fiorina do to jump-start this economy? And be specific.FIORINA: First, we have to remember what the engine of economic growth is in this nation. You know what it is? Small businesses, family-owned businesses, community based businesses. I started out in a nine-person real estate firm typing and filing.It's how most people start. Two-thirds of the new jobs are created by small businesses. Half of the Americans are employed by small businesses.We're crushing them. We're now destroying more than we're creating.That's why we have to roll back this regulatory burden and take a 75,000-page tax code and make it three pages, because guess what? When you have a big costly complicated government, only the big, the powerful, wealthy and well connected can deal with it. It's called crony capitalism. It's why we must reduce the size of government.So, we have to get small businesses up and growing again. To do so, we must reduce the power, the scope, the complexity of government.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: What would you -- what would you do about taxes? I mean, are you going to cut corporate taxes or cut taxes on the higher income people? And if you do or if you're going to campaign on that, you know that Hillary Clinton will say trickle-down economics.FIORINA: Yes. So, we have a 75,000-page tax code today. And that complexity favors the wealthy and the big and the well-connected because they can hire the accountants and the lawyers and the lobbyists to figure out how to make all that complexly work for them. We've got to get it down to three.My blueprint, lower every rate, close every loophole. Lower every rate, close very loophole.Maybe there's one or two loopholes that really help the middle class but most of these deductions and loopholes and complexities actually benefit the wealthy, the powerful, the well connected. But, yes, our tax code isn't competitive anymore. It's ridiculous that we have the highest tax code in the world -- tax rate in the world when we're trying to attract jobs here.So, lower every rate, close every loophole.WALLACE: And when Hillary Clinton says, ""Yes, and rich are going to make out like bandits""?FIORINA: What I would point out to Hillary Clinton is that every single one of the policies that she's currently pursuing make income inequality worse. Exhibit A, income inequality under the Obama administration. Exhibit B, every liberal state in this nation.I spent 12 years in the state of California, a state that's been ruled by liberals for a long time. And guess what you have: about 130 billionaires -- good for them, the highest poverty rates in the nation, the exodus of middle class and destruction of industry after industry after industry. Income inequality is worse under progressive policies because progressive policies favor the wealthy, the well-connected, the big and the powerful.WALLACE: So, let's talk micro. We've got a minute left. What's your plan now? How do you seize this moment? Because I think a lot of people are giving you either a second look or as you say some of them a first look.How do you seize this moment and become a top tier candidate?FIORINA: Honestly, I'm going to keep what I'm doing. I think I'm working really hard. Many people tell us we're outworking every campaign out there. I'm about to leave for South Carolina.We're going to talk to as many people as we can through every medium there is. I will continue to do what I've done from day one. I will answer any question. I will talk to anyone. I'm not afraid to talk about anything.The more people get to know me, the more people support me. So, that's what we're going to keep doing.I do believe this is a pivotal time in our nation's history. I'm running for president because I think if we do not win in 2016, we're going to reach a point from which we may not be able to recover.I think it's vital that we demonstrate leadership in the world once again. I think it's vital that we get this economy going and growing. And I think it's vital that we finally begin to reduce the size and power and corruption of the federal government.WALLACE: Ms. Fiorina, thank you. Thanks for coming in. Safe travels in those campaign appearances.FIORINA: Thank you.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Up next, Senator Rand Paul, who tangled with Trump and confronted Chris Christie on the debate stage. We'll ask the presidential candidate how it's shaking out now back on the campaign trail.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Senator Rand Paul says he's a different kind of Republican, and at the FOX News debate he aired those differences with Donald Trump and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.How's that working out for him?Senator Paul joins us now.Senator, we talked on ""THE O'REILLY FACTOR"" on Friday and you acknowledged that one of the reasons you were so combative in the debate is because you are lagging a bit in the polls. I know it's only been a couple days since then, but how's it paid off?SEN. RAND PAUL, R-K.Y., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, our number of contributors has gone up dramatically. We have well over 100,000 contributors. Ninety-six percent of our contributors give under $100. So, yes, we think we excited our base.And one of the things it really shows is that when you poll me head to head with Clinton, I actually lead her in five states won by President Obama. It's interesting to contrast that with Donald trump who actually is 16 points behind Clinton.So, my suggestion is next time we do a debate, maybe that ought to be a poll we ought to look at in calculating who we talk to.WALLACE: All right. You brought up Trump. Let's talk about him. You had a kind of quick exchange with him right off the bat when he refused to pledge that he would support the eventual Republican nominee. You came in cold. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS MODERATOR: OK.PAUL: This is what's wrong. He buys himself politicians of all stripes. He's already --BAIER: Dr. Paul --PAUL: Hey, look, look! He's already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: I want to go past that moment and ask you big picture. Senator, what do you think of Donald Trump?PAUL: Well, I don't think we should reward vulgarity. I don't think vulgarity equates to insight. And so, because you can shout and call people names and call someone stupid or call someone fat, is that really what we're going to make the decision on for who is going to be our nominee?You know, I came out of the Tea Party movement. And part of the Tea Party movement is we were upset with fake conservatives and Republicans who weren't conservative, Republicans who were for Obamacare and Republicans who were for the bank bailouts.Well, that's Donald Trump. He's been for all of these liberal policies and now, because he can stand up and say vulgar things and he's as truth teller.Well, the truth is, what is he for? I have no idea whether he's conservative. He really could be a liberal for all I'm concerned. I have no idea what his real philosophy is other than he's for promoting himself.WALLACE: Then there was that heated exchange with Governor Chris Christie about government surveillance. Here's a taste of that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Listen, Senator, you know, when you sit in a subcommittee just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that.PAUL: I don't trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Senator, I want to delve down into this issue. You say you want to collect records about the terrorists and not about innocent Americans, but law enforcement experts say that that is naive. They say you can't connect the dots to find somebody unless you have the dots.PAUL: Well, you know, the truth of the matter is, every time we've been attacked here on the homeland, we have had evidence in advance. We had evidence in advance on the Boston bomber, the Russians tipped us off. We also should have known he went back to Chechnya and we didn't do a good job knowing his whereabouts.The Garland shooter recently, the one who traveled from Arizona, we had evidence in advance.Major Hasan, the mass murderer at Ft. Hood, we had evidence for years that he was radicalized and had radical notions of radical Islam, and political correctness just kept -- we kept advancing him in the military because people were afraid to stand up and say enough is enough.So, no, I don't think there's any instance in which we found that the indiscriminate bulk collection of records have helped us. Three independent commissions looked at this, every one said that no terrorist has been caught through bulk collection.So, I actually do want more individualized investigation. The Fourth Amendment says you can collect records, you just have to name the target, have some suspicion, not even proof but suspicion that you present to a judge and a judge's signature.But I don't want the blanket surveillance of all Americans. I'm not willing to give up on the Bill of Rights in order to say, ""I can feel more safe"". We've been doing this. Actually we've been attacked despite collection of all these bulk records.WALLACE: But, you know, there are a lot of I think you would say respected people, maybe you wouldn't say they're respected, General Michael Hayden, former head of the CIA, Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat, former chairman of Senate Intelligence, that says that this bulk collection has worked, has protected us.I mean, let me give you a specific example. If -- and this is one that law enforcement officials say. If we suddenly discover a terrorist phone number that's being used, let's say, out of Pakistan, and we want to go back and find out who that person has been talking to, if we haven't been collecting the records, how do we go back and trace who that terrorist on that cell phone number has been calling over the last six months?PAUL: Well, what you're describing is actually an instance in which we do have specific information and we would write that down and we would say we have suspicion and I would sign the warrant for that. Then you get the information.WALLACE: Wait, sir.PAUL: The records are out there --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: But the point is if we haven't been collecting the records along the whole time when we discovered today that there's a bad guy out there using a phone call, how do we trace who he called six months ago?PAUL: The records are kept by the phone company and typically are kept for 18 months or more. There's no evidence that any of has worked is the most important thing to understand.We've been doing this for ten years. Not one terrorist has been caught through this program. But the thing is, is when you look and you say, is it illegal? The courts have said it's illegal. Many scholars are saying it's unconstitutional. I believe it to be unconstitutional.And the thing is, is I know so many young men and women who have sacrificed parts of their body, died in battle or lost limbs in battle, and I think it's a disservice to them to say, oh, we're just going to give up on the Bill of Rights while you're gone. The young men I talked to, and women I talked who fought, they say they fought for the Constitution, they fought for the Bill of Rights, and I think it's disappointing that we would give up on that, these protections.This is the freedom. When we say we're fighting for freedom, it's the freedom from government surveillance.And so, I think it's a mistake to give up on this. But it's also a mistake to believe that it's actually working. There's no evidence that it has worked at all.WALLACE: All right.PAUL: I think we need more directed surveillance and more of it.WALLACE: Senator, you say that the one thing you wish you had gotten to talk about in the debate is your tax plan. So, I'm now in the moments remaining going to give you an opportunity to do that.You favor a flat tax of 14.5 percent on personal income and a 14.5 percent European style VAT, or value added tax, which many conservatives oppose as a hidden sales tax. According to the tax foundation, a group that you often cite, the revenue that you're going to get from your tax plan, sir, would be $3 trillion -- a loss of $3 trillion in revenue over a decade.How are you going to make that up?PAUL: It depends on how you look at it, Chris. I look at it as a $3 trillion gain for taxpayer. That's a debate we ought to have.We ought to have a debate whether you want government to be bigger or smaller, and whether you want private sector to be bigger or smaller. I want the private sector to be $3 trillion bigger. That's how jobs are created. Government doesn't create jobs. And this is a real debate we ought to have on our party.WALLACE: But let me, if I may --(CROSSTALK)PAUL: Do we want tax cuts or do we want to keep government --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Let me get specific about that, because 80 percent of the money that this government spends is on entitlements and interest serving the debt -- servicing the debt. So, either critics would say, you either going to have to make substantial cuts to Medicare and Medicaid or -- that's the 80 percent -- or you're going to have to gut that other 20 percent, which is everything from defense spending to homeland security to all our social programs.I mean, how do you -- it's easy to say shrink the government. But when you got 80 percent that's entitlements, what do you do?PAUL: We have to look at everything across the board and all of government needs to be smaller.And I have put forward a plan. I put forward three five-year plans that balance the budget over five years, including significant tax cuts.But I believe in a much smaller government. That's what we have to have this debate about. If you want a Republican that's going to keep government the same size by having revenue neutral tax reform and not really cutting tax, I'm not the guy.I want to dramatically lower rates like Reagan did. But the Tax Foundation said my plan would create millions of jobs and that mine is the most pro-growth tax plan ever presented.But I go one step further, too, because when the Democrats say, oh, will this help the rich, I'm going to say it also helps the poor and the working class because my tax plan gets rid of the payroll tax. Social Security will be paid for by businesses and not by individual any longer, so a guy or a woman making $40,000 a year will get $2,000 more in their check every year.I think this will be wildly popular.WALLACE: OK.PAUL: We will have a debate.WALLACE: OK, Senator, I want to ask you --PAUL: You want government to be smaller or do you want the private sector to be bigger?WALLACE: Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt. I've got one minute left and I want to ask one other question, because it's exactly on this point of fairness.Again, talking about the Tax Foundation and what they say. Under your plan, a family making from $50,000 to $75,000 a year would get a 3 percent rise in income. Sounds pretty good. But a family making more than $1 million a year would get a 13 percent rise in income.Question, doesn't your plan massively increase income inequality?PAUL: Well, the thing is income inequality is due to some people working harder and selling more things. If people voluntarily buy more of your stuff, you'll have more money. And it's a fallacious notion to say, oh, rich people get more money back in a tax cut.If you cut taxes 10 percent, 10 percent of $1 million is more than 10 percent of $1,000. So, obviously, people who paid more in taxes will get more back.But we all end up working for people that are more successful than us, and that's a good thing that more money will be back in the economy. But let's have that debate. Do we want more money in Washington or more money in the economy?I think if we send more money back to the economy in a dramatic fashion and really are for tax cuts -- this is my problem with Republicans. So many Republicans in Washington aren't for tax cuts anymore. I'm for a dramatic tax cut.WALLACE: Senator --PAUL: More dramatic than any tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and I think that would be good for the economy.WALLACE: Senator Paul, it is an interesting debate. I want to continue it with you. Thank you. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Always good to talk with you, sir.PAUL: Thanks, Chris.WALLACE: Up next, our Sunday group tells us who will get a post-debate bounce.Plus, what do you think? Has the debate changed your mind about who you think should be the Republican nominee? Let me know on Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and use #FNS.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Lenders to your company lost over a billion dollars and more than 1,100 people were laid off. Is that the way that you run the country?DONALD TRUMP: Let me tell you about the lenders. First of all, these lenders aren't babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think. OK? You know. I mean you're living in a world of the make-believe, Chris, if you want to know the truth.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Donald Trump taking exception to my question about his history of bankruptcies at the big Fox News debate. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Syndicated columnist George Will, Lisa Lerer, national politics reporter for the Associated Press. Radio talk show host Laura Ingraham and Charles Lane from ""The Washington Post."" Laura, what do you make of Trump's comments during the debate and since?LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST ""THE LAURA INGRAHAM SHOW"": Well, I think a lot of this is a side show frankly. I think the insults, the late-night tweets, the disinviting him to conventions, here is where we're going to be if Trump is in the race or if he's out of the race. I have no idea what's going to happen with Donald Trump. There's about 20 percent, maybe as many as 30 percent of GOP voters in the country today who are absolutely livid at the GOP. OK. And these people are so mad and they're so frustrated that they are willing to throw in with someone who has no political experience, who's obviously can be very crude and sometimes very rude and they are so mad that they're willing to go with him because he's saying things about whether it's mass migration or illegal immigration, bad trade deals that pretty much no one else is saying.So, I think the focus should be how is the GOP if it's a Scott Walker or if it's Jeb Bush, whoever the nominee is going to be, how is the GOP going to win without that ten, 20 or 30 percent of that vote. Whatever it is. They need those people to go back to the GOP if Trump goes away. So, that's been my focus consistently. And all of this intrigue and insults, I think that is just -- that's going to go away. And then the GOP is going to have to put itself back together again like humpy dumpty.WALLACE: Well, I want to pick up on that, and it leads me perfectly to you, Chuck, because the lead story in your paper ""The Washington Post"" today was basically well, the GOP thinks maybe Trump's balloon is beginning to lose steam and that they're going to be able to pivot to more conventional politicians. But it sort of begs the question, how can they control this and isn't it really up to the voters as to whether they're going to stay with Trump or move away and try to find another Republican at this point they don't like those other Republicans as much.CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes, and there's no real test of the voters for a while. It's all just measured by polls. He might live or die by the polls. I think what this shows is that Laura is absolutely right. There's this volatile element within the party that the party kind of doesn't know how to handle and the element doesn't know how to handle the party. But I think that he may have gone a little bit too far with his comments about Megyn Kelly and you saw for the first time people who - I mean Eric Erickson is not some sort of ...WALLACE: He's the head of the - head of the Red Lock, the organization Red State.LANE: He's not a hypersensitive politically correct liberal who banned Donald Trump from his conference because of that. That brought a lot of other comments out from Republicans. There's almost now a divide within the party between those who are overtly condemning him and those who are not. You saw that Huckabee and Cruz have held back. And the problem for the establishment of the party is there is no limiting factor on how long Donald Trump can stay in this race except for what Donald Trump feels like doing.WALLACE: George, your thoughts about Donald Trump, the debate and the shape of the Republican race in the wake of the debate?LANE: I would begin by disputing the premise of both Chuck and Laura, which is that these are Republican voters. These are not Tea Party voters who are very substantive. I think that people attracted to Donald Trump are marginally connected to politics at all and are brought in to this for the entertainment value. I would like to think that the beginning of the end was the question you asked in the debate when you said what is your evidence for your statements about the complicity of the Mexican government. Donald Trump doesn't do evidence. He says apoplexy is a substitute for argument. So he just went off on another rant. Time will come when politics becomes blocking and tackling. You go to Iowa. You have to organize. You have to sit in a lot of living rooms with a macaroon in one hand and a cup of hot chocolate in the other. Now, picture Donald Trump doing that. I can't. So I think he will sick his own nipple (ph).WALLACE: But I just want to - Before we move on to Lisa, let's say it's 20 or 30 percent you say that are not Republicans, that are not conservatives. They are people. They're voters. And, you know, if they either sit out and I think generally speaking you would say they have voted for the Republicans certainly against the Democrat or if Donald Trump and he has certainly - has left it open, ran as the third-party candidacy, wouldn't that be enough to sink the Republican nominee either way?WILL These are voters that the Republicans want. The Republicans want all voters. And particularly these voters. But to say that he's tapped into something, Henry Wallace tapped into something in the far left of American politics in the late '40s. The John Birch Society tapped into something. George Wallace tapped into something. And it was up to the grown-ups and the labor movement in the 1940s and the grown-ups in the conservative movement in the 1960s to read those elements, the Riot Act and say come back in, but come back in on our terms because we're not going down the road you want to go.WALLACE: Lisa, let me bring you in. You are covering the Clinton campaign for A.P. In the debate, several candidates toughened their stance on abortion and any limits on some of the exceptions that are allowed now for legal abortion. There were moves to the right on same-sex marriage and immigration. As they watched the debate - And I think there was a general sort of move to the right in this - maybe with the exception of Jeb Bush and a couple of others, were they licking their chops in the Clinton headquarters?LISA LERER, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, I actually was reporting from Clinton headquarters during the debate. And I can tell you, the mood was pretty upbeat over there. You know, there's a misalignment of incentives here between the two parties. Republicans are looking at this through the lens of the primary, which of course they have to do. And they have to take certain positions to win over the Republican base. But the Clinton team has a luxury of looking through this to the general election. So, they were pretty gleeful about some of the positions Republicans took on issues like abortion, exceptions to abortion, the case of rape, incest, life of the mother, on gay marriage, on immigration. Their plan is to basically resurrect the Obama coalition of young women and minority voters that boosted him to the White House twice. Those issues play particularly well with that group. So, they see a lot to work with here.Now, that's not to say there weren't a few shadows in all that sunshine and rainbows, right, that they were seeing. Rubio, I think, they're going to be paying a little bit closer attention to him. He could present a pretty strong generational argument against Hillary Clinton and Kasich also caught their attention. You know, I think it's an open question whether he could get through the primary process on the Republican side, but if he did - he could present this ...WALLACE: Now, but the name you're not mentioning, which I think a lot of people thought might be the potentially - the strongest Republican candidate in a general election against Hillary Clinton is Jeb Bush.LERER: Right. Well, you know, they've been keeping a close eye on him in the run-up to the debate. Clinton had really focused her attacks, her sharp attacks for a couple of days on Jeb Bush. So, he was already on their list. He remains on their list. You know, certainly he's the best funded in the Republican field and they are worried about his pull with Latinos in the general.WALLACE: Laura, we've got about a minute left. With Trump pushing the envelope even further with Jeb Bush, I think it's fair to say having a somewhat disappointing performance on Thursday night, who is the front runner for the Republican nomination?INGRAHAM: Well, we'll see the new polls that come out. But you know, I always -- I have been saying this for two years. And George probably disagrees with me. But I think Jeb Bush probably won that debate. And people say ...WALLACE: Really?(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: this performance. I tell you why he won it. Because the focus was on Megyn and Trump, OK? And Jeb Bush quietly and George W. Bush is calling him the tortoise now, because he's quietly amassing the donor base. His has now $120 million in the bank. And his network is locked down. Once that Bush negative advertising starts flowing against anyone who rears his or her head, whether it's Marco or Carly or John Kasich, we're going to see what was done to Gingrich in Florida when Romney took out Gingrich in Florida in 2012, Bush is really good at talking about tone. But when push comes to shove, that negative advertising is going to blanket Florida, New Hampshire, and beyond. So, I still look at Jeb Bush as a front runner. Trump may be still up in the polls. I don't know how long he'll stay in. He's the man to beat still in my mind.WALLACE: 30 seconds, George Will, who is the front runner?WILL: There is no front runner. It won't be a Republican race to speak of until this coarse and vulgar man who is at the center of this argument is marginalized. When that happens, we're going to see who the strength is. We're going to see also, Laura, the declining utility of the last political dollar, the last $40 million really don't matter that much.INGRAHAM: We'll see.(LAUGHTER)INGRAHAM: We'll see.WALLACE: To be continued. All right. We have to take a break here. When we come back, President Obama dramatically escalates his rhetoric trying to sell his Iran nuclear deal to Congress. But one of the Senate's Democratic leaders, Democratic leaders says he'll vote against the deal. Will the Iran agreement pass? We'll ask the panel next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Now you can contact with ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"" on Facebook and Twitter.

Be part of the discussion weighing in on the action every ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: It's those hardliners chanting ""Death to America"" who have been most opposed to the deal. They're making common cause with the Republican caucus.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: President Obama shocking a lot of people in Washington, both Republicans and Democrats with that comment as he fights to get his Iran nuclear deal through Congress. And we're back now with the panel. George, after comparing Republicans in Congress to the death to America crowd in Tehran, I'm not sure where it goes from there.WILL: Judging intentions by behavior. I would say that both the Iranian government and the Obama administration want this defeated. The Iranian government is taunting us by saying no matter what the words say, you can't go here, you can't go there for inspections and then this extraordinarily un-presidential speech. It's impossible to imagine Dwight Eisenhower or Jack Kennedy giving a speech that portrays his adversaries like this. The big development this week was Schumer. Now, the question is, did Schumer come out against this because they already have sufficient votes, sufficient votes for what? Sufficient to override to sustain a veto. I think that's what we're looking at. One-third plus one member of one House of Congress because the president in his ongoing constitutional vandalism will not submit this as a treaty which it obviously should be.WALLACE: I have to say, that was a really good answer, because you basically answered every question I'm now going to ask all of the others.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: It was really sort of one stop shopping. Let me pick up on Schumer. And for folks out there who may not know, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the number three person in the Democratic leadership in the Senate, but basically he's locked up after Harry Reid retires in 2016, he will be the Senate Democratic leader in 2017. He came out this week during the Republican debate at about 10:00 at night against the vote. The White House wasn't very happy. And here's what they had to say about Chuck Schumer and getting the new job.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I certainly wouldn't be surprised if there are individual members of the Senate Democratic caucus that will consider the voting record of those who say they would like to lead the caucus.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: In other words, if Chuck Schumer is going to vote against one of the president's top priorities, maybe Democrats shouldn't make them their leader. Lisa, what do you make of Schumer's decision to go against the president on this huge issue and what do you make of that response from the White House?LERER: Well, the big question here, right, of course, is whether this is an indicator of the vote or an indicator of how tough the politics is. Particularly for Jewish Democrats or Democrats with front states with big Jewish blocks. I think it's more of the latter. Based in part for how he announced this. He announced it after they had left for recess. He announced it sort of quietly. It was supposed to be quietly at night. Like he has it - he signaled that he's not going to be rallying his fellow Democrats against the cause of this Iran deal. So, I think this more has to do with how difficult the politics are for members like Schumer. I also think the president's rhetoric is in part due to the fact that they are beginning to see the House as a sort of firewall. In order to sustain a veto he needs one-third as George pointed out of one body. If that body is the House, that kind of fiery rhetoric plays much better there. So, they may be targeting Democrats in the House to make sure that this thing gets through, of course, by veto.WALLACE: Well, let's talk about the politics because Congress is now on a six-week recess. They've worked so hard this year so far. And when they get home, they're going to face a huge multimillion dollar - I mean I'm talking tens of millions of dollars lobbying campaign, TV, commercials, all of that by pro-Israel groups against the Iran deal. Laura, how much trouble is this deal in?INGRAHAM: I don't think it's in much trouble. I think Nancy Pelosi is rounding up the votes in the House. She's a loyalist on this deal. Dick Durbin feels like he has the votes in the Senate. Tammy Baldwin is going to vote for the deal.WALLACE: Explain who she is and ...INGRAHAM: Tammy Baldwin is a Wisconsin senator and she's someone people are looking to as the future of the Democratic Party. Kirsten Gillibrand often talked about it, the future ...WALLACE: New York Senator.INGRAHAM: Yeah, a presidential contender sometime in the future. She's voting for the deal. The couple people on the fence. Harry Reid is retiring. He's going to ultimately vote for the deal. So, I think this is - Schumer probably does have problems with the deal, but also he has a lot of donors who have problems with the deal. So, it didn't really surprise me that Schumer in the end did this. I don't think it's going to make a difference. So, I think with the Obama insult to anyone who stands against this deal, it is just - it's interesting given this great feeling everybody had after the trade promotion authority was passed with this bipartisan push with Boehner and McConnell. That didn't last long, did it? I mean Obama goes right from that kumbaya moment on trade to filleting the Republicans on Iran. It was pretty - it was Obama-like.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: OK. Now, we have kind of touched on this, but let me explain again. Congress does not have to approve this deal. And they certainly don't have to approve it by the super majority for a treaty. Because it is just an executive agreement. So, what happens is let's say that Congress and if they probably will, the Republican majority, votes to disapprove the agreement and then the president can veto that disapproval and then all he needs in one of the - both Houses, one or either House, is one-third plus one in the Senate that would mean 34 votes, 33 plus one, 34, and there are 46 Democrats, I don't know what the math is in the House and what that would mean. But what do you think? I mean are they going to be able to get one-third plus one of Democrats either in the House or the Senate to sustain a presidential veto of a resolution of disapproval? I'm worn out from all that part of ...LANE: Well, it's good that you explained it, because first of all, to answer your question, yes, I do think at the end of the day, I agree with the rest of the panel, this thing will go through by perhaps a narrow margin. But as you basically described it, what we have here is a game, in which the rules maximize the opportunity to vote without consequence against this deal, right? It's a pretty free vote for everybody who is against it, because at the end of the day the president gets the veto and he will have a minority of supporters enable to get it through.But I just want to emphasize that as we look at the cost and benefits of this Iran deal, whatever they are, I think we now have to add to the cost side tremendous division within American politics about an issue where in the past there used to be consensus, namely or posture toward Iran. This - the Iranian have achieved, I think, something very important by dividing the United States from Israel, possibly in a lasting way. They have divided Republicans from Democrats and now with the Schumer thing, they are dividing Democrats from Democrats. The opposition to this, obviously, spreads across party lines. And the rhetoric on both sides is as inflammatory as it can possibly be and when the money starts flowing, we'll get more inflammatory.So, in an area where we used to have some consensus in this country, we now have nothing, but division. I would add there's also a point about presidential leadership here. The last time we had a president as certain he was right about something was just before George Bush decided to invade Iraq. And it's a little ironic and a little, I think, worrisome that the president is quite so certain that he's absolutely right.WALLACE: We have got about a minute left, George. Let's play this out. Let's assume that Congress kills the deal, you know, and that they are able to muster the votes to override the presidential veto. We would keep - the U.S. would keep our economic sanctions, but the rest of the world is - including the U.N. is dropping their sanctions. What happens then?WILL: Well, what happens then is Iran gets richer and Iran becomes with its fueled by this money becomes more disruptive in the Middle East, so that the negotiations themselves were a triumph for the Iranians, precisely because they put us in this position. And at the end of this the president's - principle domestic achievement, his legacy will be the Affordable Care Act deeply unpopular five years later and a foreign policy semi-treaty agreement that the country dislikes.WALLACE: Well, and in that sense, Iran getting richer. That happens whether or not the Congress approves the deal or not because the sanctions are lifted and they also -- the arms embargo is lifted five years from now and the missile embargo is lifted eight years from now.WILL: That's what I'm saying. The damage was done by the negotiations.WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. Up next, our power player of the week. The people's diva gives me a singing lesson.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you a tenor?WALLACE: I don't know what I am. I used to sing in the bathroom.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: All right. I admit it. I don't like opera. Hours of people howling in a language I don't understand. As we told you in March, if anyone can get me to change my mind, it's our power player of the week.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)RENEE FLEMING, OPERA SINGER: I haven't really been able to transfer into that extraordinary other worldly creature other than I hope on stage.WALLACE: Renee Fleming has been called the people's diva. It's a title she loves. Yes, she is America's leading opera star who has played 54 different roles. But she prides herself on being down to earth.(on camera): Are you at all a diva? Are you difficult?FLEMING: Am I a diva? Well, you know, there are people who probably had their moments with me. A lot of bad behavior in singers is caused by nerves. But my philosophy is that the people around us are there doing as much work if not more work behind the scenes and they are the last people you would ever be unkind to. So, I hope I'm not a diva off stage.(singing): I want to live with ...WALLACE (voice over): She's made a point of going beyond opera singing rock and jazz and last year becoming the first classical artist to sing ""The National Anthem"" at the Super Bowl.FLEMING: In those two minutes which have to be perfect or it will follow you for the rest of your career, I can't say I've had another experience quite like it. But it was thrilling.WALLACE: Whatever the venue, Fleming is also known as the beautiful voice.(on camera): How is it that you're able to create this remarkable sound?FLEMING: My speaking voice is horrendous, right?WALLACE: No.FLEMING: So, but I mean, it's sort of weak and it's not very resonant. But then when I sing, the sound is a totally different range, color, all of it. It's all about the breath. You take in a breath and you make a sound. So, for instance, if you say hello, Renee. Try that.WALLACE: Hello, Renee.FLEMING: So, I would teach you how to enhance that, how to increase the range. Hello, Renee.WALLACE: Hello, Renee.FLEMING: Are you a tenor?WALLACE: I don't know what I am. I used to sing in the bathroom.FLEMING: Just try a siren.WALLACE: No, I'm not doing that.WALLACE (voice over): Mast class aside, Fleming who just turned 56 and says she'll retire from opera within three years and just do recitals.FLEMING: My whole career, I played these girls sort of 18 to 23. And then - so, you know, and we can suspend disbelief to a point and then you sort of think that's enough of that.WALLACE: But don't worry. The people's diva will continue to share her remarkable talent.FLEMING: It's just something incredibly moving that the human being, a human being can make this sound. And that great music has been cultivated around it. I feel very privileged to be doing this.WALLACE: Renee Fleming isn't taking any time off with several performances scheduled in the U.S. and overseas. Now an update on last week's ""Power Player"" Katie Ledecky. The teenage swimming star won five gold medals at the world championships in Russia this week breaking her own world records in the 800 and 1,500 meter races. We send our congratulations. That's it for today. Have a great week. And we'll see you next ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY.""Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""It's another big night and the race for the republican nomination on this primary day. Voting is underway right now in four states. On the GOP side, 150 delegates are up for grabs, 59 in Michigan, 40 in Mississippi, 32 in Idaho, and 19 in Hawaii. The first polls close in just under three hours from now in Mississippi. Donald Trump said he wants to take on Ted Cruz in a two-man race. But is that such a good idea? According to the latest national poll by the Washington Post and ABC News, the GOP front-runner falls short against Cruz and Marco Rubio in head to head match-ups. Here's what the republican rivals are saying on the campaign trail before tonight's elections results.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Here in Florida if you vote for John Kasich or Ted Cruz, you are voting for Donald Trump. I am the only one that can beat him in Florida. I am the only one that stops from here.GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're focused here in Michigan today. We want to do as well as we can do here, and then we go to Ohio. And we're now getting on home turf. Brian, you understand this better than anybody. In March madness, you want to play home games, and we're getting closer and closer to home games. So we'll take it a day at a time.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you don't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, and if you don't want to see Hillary Clinton as the president, which is the inevitable result of Donald Trump being the nominee, come join us. Let us stand together.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And I saw some polls yesterday in Michigan where I'm 19 and 20 points up. And I saw some very, very good polls. I'm still leading in Florida against a failed senator. You know, Rubio is a failed senator.(END VIDEO CLIPS)GUILFOYLE: All right. Eric, tell us about the numbers for tonight and what needs to happen in terms of the math adding up, because we're hearing a lot of potential scenarios and --ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: So again, I spent the day -- I'm spending every day, you should see my desk, it's like papers and numbers spread out everywhere and --GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: A bottle of rum?BOLLING: A bottle of vodka in the back.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Proportional delegates --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: The two big ones, obviously, being Michigan and Mississippi. Michigan because of the delegate count, and Mississippi because, if Donald Trump does win Mississippi, it will kind of round out the whole south of the only thing left in the south being Florida. So he would want to win that just to make the map look good. We could use a billboard for that, but interesting though, the numbers -- by the numbers, the total vote count, kind of close. Donald Trump at 38 percent of all the votes, Ted Cruz with 31 percent of all the votes cast. Important, because between the two of them, that's 69, almost 70 percent of all votes cast on the GOP side for either Trump or Ted Cruz. Again, going, looking forward to, if it's not -- if they go to a brokered convention, it doesn't look like it is. In my opinion, if they do, that will be tough to not name one of those two, your nominee.GUILFOYLE: I'll take your point.BOLLING: Total contests, have been 20 total contests between states and territories. Trump has won 60 percent of them, 12 of them. And Cruz has won 30 percent. So between two of them they've not only won 70 percent of the vote, they've won 90 percent of the contest.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Wait, wait, wait, I love numbers.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Are you making an argument for why there should not be a brokered convention?BOLLING: Let me, let me just tell you why one would -- why the total contest really matters more than the total votes.WILLIAMS: All right.BOLLING: No one's talking about the total contest, but here's why. Going forward after tonight, proportional, but after tonight, going forward, Florida, North Carolina, Illinois, Ohio, that's 306 delegates. New York, Pennsylvania, and California, 338 delegates, that means going forward. Those are winner take all states. So if you're just getting one more vote than the second place guy, you're getting all the votes. That's why total contests really matter. So again, Trump comes in with 60 percent of total, Cruz at 30 percent.WILLIAMS: Wait, wait. Your point is there shouldn't be a brokered convention?BOLLING: There shouldn't be.WILLIAMS: Because -- but you realize --BOLLING: Because there's a winning 70 percent of the popular vote and 90 percent of the contest.WILLIAMS: But as we, were going over yesterday, the rules are.BOLLING: Sure.WILLIAMS: . if you don't reach the delegate count you made it.BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: But the rule says you can have a brokered convention.BOLLING: You can, but it should go to one of those two.WILLIAMS: That so.GUILFOYLE: All right Dana, I want to get your thoughts on this process. Because it is -- I mean, there's a tremendous amount, right there with the two percentages between the two, but take it to the next level.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, tonight our contests that are not winner take all, so it's proportional. So even if you win a certain state, you come out first, but if you -- whoever comes in second, if they close that gap, then you're a proportional delegates. So we are not at a winner take all position yet, that will be next Tuesday. So everybody will want it to and then.BOLLING: Right, right.PERINO: And Trump needs to win about 54 percent of all the remaining delegates. It's kind of an up-hill climb as if you look at what he's had so far, you don't get to 1237. Go ahead.BOLLING: Yes. He does need on win the delegates. But going forward, because it becomes winner take all, you don't have to win 54 percent of the votes, you just have to win the 54 percent of the states going forward, and all you need is one more vote than the second place. There's why the total contest matters versus votes. I'm sorry.GUILFOYLE: And Dana?PERINO: You -- whoever it is has to get to 1237. If they don't get the 1237, there is a process by which there is a -- there are delegates that awarded. The thing people aren't talking about yet is that state contests are about to happen to award those delegates. You actually, in many states -- every state is different. But every state has people who decide to run in order to be a delegate. So those contests are going to happen, starting about 10 days from now, like first week of April. That's when the Michigan one happens. My only point is that 1237 is the magic number. When Mitt Romney got to 1244 in the contest, there wasn't anybody -- there wasn't any real competition left by that point, but they had a big celebration, because they knew he would be the nominee. Short of that, they could not have had that celebration, so that's a reason to keep paying attention.GUILFOYLE: And Dana, one more question I can tag on to that to you is that I was watching (inaudible) earlier, and he said here tonight, it matters because we're going to see what happens with these, you know, four states, but he called next Tuesday, Titanic -- not Super Tuesday but Titanic Tuesday, or it's going to be like the Titanic and somebody has to go under after those results.PERINO: But -- well, possibly, and you can -- you narrow it down from there, but the two may -- those two very important states, not only for Titanic Tuesday, (inaudible) we're calling it, or for the general election. Ohio and Florida, two very key states for republicans, no matter what, they really need to win them if they plan to win in the -- they want to win in the general election. John Kasich is trying to make a case that he could win Ohio. Rubio or Cruz are saying that they could try to deny Trump that win in Florida, I think both of those things might be difficult, but we'll know a lot more tonight. Remember, in all those contests that we've had so far, the polling has been way higher than what the voting has actually come in at. So I'm not ready to call it yet. We don't even have election polls - - result until 6:00 p.m.GUILFOYLE: All right, there you go. We've got some smart analysis at this table. Greg, can you -- if you --GUTFELD: And now you're coming to me?GUILFOYLE: And this is why, you know -- stay with us folks --GUTFELD: All right. I just want to apologize for that endless amount of boring statistics. Look, there are 19 delegates in Hawaii. This is important because three of them are McGarrett, Danno and Chin Ho, and they matter to me. But Mississippi has 40 delegates. This is important because without Mississippi, how can you count when you play hide and seek?GUILFOYLE: My god.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: I'm glad I waited until seven minutes in for that.GUTFELD: Yes. A vote for x is a vote for y. We need to ban that. I'm tired of hearing a vote for Trump is a vote for Hillary. A vote for Rubio is a vote for Trump. A vote for Laverne is a vote for Shirley. A vote is a vote is a vote. The vote -- the person you vote for is the person you vote for, and that's what you should do. You shouldn't say, I'm not gonna vote for this person because it's kind of allow this person to win. You should vote for the person that you want to vote for. I'm kind of tired of hearing that.GUILFOYLE: OK, are you going to ban people that --GUTFELD: I'm banning you.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. OK. Well too bad, I'm in charge. OK, Juan, I like your color complementing with mine. So what do think about --WILLIAMS: I got the memo.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, you got the memo -- about tonight, because they're all pointing fingers, dirty tricks, this and that. But tonight is a big night in terms of the results. We're going to have a much clearer picture, and as Eric were showing earlier, in terms of the percentages, you pretty tight right now between Trump and Cruz.WILLIAMS: What interests me so much, Kimberly, is that I don't think Cruz is gonna do -- win anything tonight. I don't think he has much of a shot and I don't think he thinks he has much of a shot to win anything tonight. So it looks to me like a big night for Trump. But then the question becomes by what margin does Trump win? Because what we've seen in these polls and the most recent polls is, they indicate that Trump's lead seems to be declining or shrinking at the moment. So what does that tell you? It tells you that all these adds being pushed by conservative establishment groups on the republican side, may be having some impact on Donald Trump. Now, if that's the case, boy, Eric, that shakes things up.BOLLING: Not at all.WILLIAMS: . because going forward --BOLLING: Not at all.WILLIAMS: Well, hey --BOLLING: It's not at all.WILLIAMS: Can I talk for a second?BOLLING: Yeah, sure. Sure, go ahead, But --WILLIAMS: I let you speak for so long.BOLLING: Yeah. I'm listening. Go.WILLIAMS: All right. So you have an opportunity here, I think to find out whether or not the conservative establishment has identified real weaknesses in Trump that resonate with the base, with the base. And that's the question. We have now going forward states where, as you were pointing out. Often time it's limited to republican voters. Not anybody just jumping in. How do republicans, real republicans react to these attacks on Trump coming from the republican establishment?BOLLING: Can I just talk about what you -- so tonight is the last time proportional matters, as Dana point out.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: Proportional delegates will go.PERINO: Not necessarily.BOLLING: Well, OK. But going forward, like I just I outline 700 delegates over the -- in seven states going forward, that will be winner take all, or all the leader has to do is win by one vote. So that's why a narrowing lead isn't that important.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: Again, here's the most important stat of all of them. In 2016 versus 2008, the last time there was a primary, an open primary.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: . the republicans have come out 65 percent higher turnout in the - - on the republican side than 2008, 65 percent.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: . on the democrat side, down 30 percent. So --WILLIAMS: Wait a second. It's a different conversation. I'm glad to have it because it really doesn't make any difference --BOLLING: No question, but --WILLIAMS: As it may have difference to give that is that --BOLLING: The point is whatever is going on, on the republican side is bringing new people to the new republicans to the table.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: New voters to the republican table.WILLIAMS: I think that's undeniable. Boy, Donald Trump is entertaining. He drives up ratings. Everybody loves and care about him.BOLLING: I said whatever is going on.WILLIAMS: I think Trump is what's going on. I don't think there's any question about that. But I'm just telling you, if you look historically in previous cycles, when you see one side, you know, pouring out, especially when you have an incumbent president from the other side, it doesn't necessarily translate to what happens in the general.GUILFOYLE: Greg?GUTFELD: The interesting thing and it is true about the -- how many angry new voters there -- are in this process? It implies that they weren't voting republican in 2008 and 2012, when President Obama won. We could have used them. So when someone says they are angry and they're blaming, quote, ""the establishment"" but incorporating all these conservative that may have worked for the past eight years to fight against Obama, why aren't you there? We welcome you, but you shouldn't. You shouldn't enter this party and say, it's your fault, because we, perhaps, could have used it. Conservatism is not a restaurant that you can trash on yelp. It is a group of people. It's a group of people that have worked against liberals for many, many years that have been ideologically fairly pure that have supported candidates that are less than perfect, but they were there. They were there. And that's important and you can't forget that.GUILFOYLE: All right. On a positive note, thank God for National Pancake Day, because I'm going to need something sweet after that. We're going to do -- put our rally caps on, a lot of interesting stuff tonight, a programming note. Keep it locked on Fox News for complete primary coverage, beginning at 8:00 p.m. eastern with Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier. And later, don't miss our special live midnight edition -- yes, you can spread the virus at the table -- edition of the ""The Five"" tonight with our post election analysis on today's races coming up. Marco Rubio's team is blasting Ted Cruz. You've might heard this today, over so-called dirty tricks. Details on the latest GOP campaign trail accusations when we return. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: The Rubio campaign is striking back against a CNN report that some advisers want him to drop out of race, even before Florida next week. Rubio's team confronted the network about this erroneous reporting last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALEX CONANT, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR RUBIO CAMPAIGN: Jamie's report was utter nonsense. She denied contact the campaign prior to coming on the show last night, we were reporting that. It is 100 percent absolutely false. I think CNN is doing a disservice to voters by airing that sort of, that sort of reporting, without even checking with the campaign.WOLF BLITZER, CNN POLITICAL ANCHOR: Some of her sources close to the campaign, inside the campaign, not the senator himself, clearly not you, saying one of them saying he doesn't want to get killed in his home state.CONANT: Well, I have a lot of respect for you, but I'm asking you to stop reading that sort of fiction on air, because it is not true at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Even the Washington Post is slamming the reporting saying, quote, ""CNN didn't have the level of specificity in order to make it credible."" Shortly after that, Cruz' team allegedly sent out this e-mail to voters in Hawaii with the subject line, wasted vote, outlining why voting for Rubio would be a mistake. On America's Newsroom earlier, Rubio's team blasted Cruz over his campaign tactics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CAITLIN CONANT, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR RUBIO CAMPAIGN: I can tell you that Ted Cruz today has been spreading it around, because they're scared that Marco Rubio is going to win Florida. And it is the same type of nonsense that he did against Ben Carson, when there were false reports that he was dropping out of the race. And it is really fortunate that this camp is going to say or do anything to get elected.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: In a preview from this town hall airing tomorrow on The Kelly File, Cruz clarifies, saying the e-mail was not authorized by his campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: Well, look, that the nature of politics is that when a campaign is flailing, they attack. And they attack other candidates and they attack their integrity. This particular e-mail apparently came from a volunteer in Hawaii, not affiliated with the campaign. Not working with the campaign.(shouting)CRUZ: Not only that, our legal counsel sent them a letter saying, take that, take that e-mail and bounce.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right, so here's the tip, Greg. If you are still on the race, the four of them, if -- unless you hear from the campaign manager themselves to the other campaign, and a call of a heads up, don't go with these rumors because everybody is saying they're not getting out.GUTFELD: Yeah, you know, rumors are like the flu. If you give someone the flu you don't blame it on the person who gave it to you. It is your responsibility to keep other people from hearing a rumor, especially if it is not substantiated. You know, I hear bad stuff all the time about you, Dana. But I never --PERINO: Probably at this table.GUTFELD: No. No, Kimberly, stop.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: But you never report on things until you go and you have it that substantiated. And you should, you should always be skeptical because somebody always has something to gain when they're saying something bad. Like Cruz or whoever has something to gain. So the CNN producer probably should have called Rubio --PERINO: But that's one thing. It's that why not -- let's say that she had one source, either close to or inside the campaign, Kimberly. But then why not also then call an official spokesperson so that you include in the story, they've denied or they've hedged or whatever. That's been --GUILFOYLE: Yeah, yeah. You're absolutely right. Because just with a little bit of journalistic integrity and chasing the story down to make sure you have accurate sources, you can avoid that. But guess what? Then you might not have a story, right? So it kind of it goes to suggest what the motivation and sort of self-preservation, self-interest that's operating there. Because if you're really interested in the truth, you would do your homework and you would make sure before you say something incredibly damaging. It's also a little bit that easy because we've heard this sort of drip, drip from the faucet, right? So they just opened it up a little bit more about, oh Ted Cruz, dirty tricks, oh what Ted Cruz with Carson, when Carson said, listen, don't believe these rumors. I was just going home to get a change of clothes from Florida. You know, I wasn't dropping out of the race. So now when we hear it, there's a little bit of layering psychologically, so people tend to believe it, like what kind of sounds. So whether it is true or not, they've heard it and the perception becomes the reality.PERINO: Also Eric, before next Tuesday, when Ohio and Florida takes place, I think it's unreasonable to think that either Kasich or Rubio are going to get out of the race before their home state vote.BOLLING: Right. So the way I see it and --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: First of all, I run the numbers on this, and here's what I found today.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Where's the whiteboard?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Why does it have to be white?PERINO: I just noticed the height difference.BOLLING: There are times where we'll get an e-mail saying, whatever, Ben Carson may be dropping out tonight, but don't go to air with it because we're trying to confirm with the campaign. That's what journalists do for Wolf to say some of his sources said it. But one of them inside, close to the campaign may have said it. It's the little -- I think they should have definitely tied up a lot stronger before they went to air with it. Let's take it one step further, though. I don't really think Ted Cruz is to blame for a campaign person.PERINO: I agree.BOLLING: . sending something to Hawaii or from Hawaii, whatever. I mean, there are so many people involved in these campaigns. If they hear something, and you don't know if they are a volunteer, they could be a student, who knows? So it's hard to hold Ted Cruz accountable for like that.PERINO: I agree.BOLLING: . didn't vote. One of those other spokespersons did, persons did? I think that's a mistake. But look, and Kimberly is right, because of what happened in Iowa, maybe that's the reason why some of it. So let's everyone take a step back.GUILFOYLE: Right and easy.BOLLING: The pride didn't happen and let's move on from here. But CNN definitely -- they tied up those loose ends.PERINO: Last word from -- you worked on a lot of campaigns.WILLIAMS: I did. And I'll tell you something, I love grudges. Because guess what, somebody has a grudge, they're going to call me. They're going to call me and spread a rumor, Gregory.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: . and I like rumors. But then you got to go do the reporting. Now in this case, you know what? There is a lot of logic to the idea that Rubio does not want to get embarrassed in Florida. So as a reporter, I would think, hmm, there's something to this story. So if she, the reporter, (inaudible) went and found such a person, I think she was obligated, as Kimberly was saying to get an official statement. Doesn't necessarily mean the story was not real. And the final point is when something fits a narrative pattern. I know narrative is a banned word, but if it fits a pattern. And remember, Donald Trump calling Cruz a liar. Ben Carson saying I'm having a private meeting and suddenly it's out in public. Where did it come from? Boy, I think a lots of people think, geez, Ted Cruz, you play hard, buddy. I don't know if you play fair.PERINO: All right, bottom line is, I don't think anybody is dropping out before Titanic Tuesday or whatever we're calling it.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: All right, coming up. Donald Trump's rise in the Republican Party is like the rise of Islamic extremism? That's the allegations, just the latest attack against the front-runner by members of the media. Greg is going to break it down, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: This just sit in: Donald Trump supporters are planning to carry out terrorist attacks on the West. I'm sorry. Did I say Trump's supporters? I mean, ISIS. Forgive my confusion. I was just watching CNN, where Fareed Zakaria actually compares Donald fans to radical Islamists. What a tool:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FAREED ZAKARIA, JOURNALIST: A mean cause of the rise of the extremism in the world of Islam has been the cowardice of Muslim moderates who for decades chose not to condemn bad ideas and ugly rhetoric... avoided confronting the cancer in plain sight.... It is now clear that a similar dynamic has been at play in the world of conservatism.... What is different about the conservative movement is that since the 1990s, some of its most distinguished mainstream members have embraced the rhetoric and tactics of the extremes.... The problem is not that Republican leaders should have begun to condemn Trump last year, it is that they should have condemned the ideas and tactics that led to his rise when they began to flourish in the last century.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I wonder what book he lifted that from. Now comparing American voters peacefully, participating in democracy to beheaders -- sucks. But maybe in Fareed's head, he meant the comparison as the criticism of ISIS. The blaming conservatism for Trump also makes no sense because Trump isn't an ideological conservative. If anything his past beliefs are closer to Fareed's. Trump succeeds by cross-dressing across belief.I also don't recall Fareed worrying about strident movements born from the left. Like occupy Wall Street, the new black panthers, the intolerance mob currently on campus shutting down free speech. Would he ever say the same thing about Sanders' groupies who drool over a socialist? Fareed ignores harmful beliefs, instead to bash scary words.And one could call Fareed's rhetoric, scarier. Comparing American voters to Islamists? Shut up. I have my criticisms of Trump. Criticism is my thing. The right who now embrace a centrist Trump, seek a safe space for assessment? That bugs me. But that's not Islamic extremist. It's a mirror of the intolerance movement of the modern left. It's a mirror that Fareed refuses to look at.But you know the thing is, Dana, it's a reflex in all of us to compare something we don't like to something worse. It's like, we kind of all do that, but then we think twice and we go, that's not fair, correct?PERINO: Well, ISIS is the new Nazi, OK?GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And what he is doing there is watering down the argument about good versus evil.GUTFELD: Aha.PERINO: If you cannot see the difference, you might not like republican politics or conservative politics or whatever it is now that we are apparently headed toward. But believe me, what he just said is definitely going around the cocktail circuit. This is what is being repeated in campuses all across the country. This is what polite -- what you can say in polite company at dinner tables, whispered about those evil Republicans, that they're just like ISIS. It's absurd, and it doesn't help anybody, especially I really don't think it helps President Obama or Hillary Clinton, actually, which is presumably who he would want to support.GUTFELD: Maybe he said it is because he's scared.BOLLING: Well, I think that's exactly. Won't blame Donald Trump for Donald Trump. He wants to blame what he calls conservative leaders for the rise of Donald Trump and the rhetoric. Blame Trump if you don't have a problem with Trump. Right? Or what is he? Afraid he's going to, you know, call you out? Or do what you did to him?I'm not really sure what the point was there. And let me see if I make this leap. So he's blaming conservative leaders; therefore, blaming conservatives for the rise of Donald Trump and the stepping up of rhetoric which is going to lead to Islamic extremism? Haven't we heard this before from time and time again? That the right causes Islam? Didn't Obama say that some far-right groups are the reason for the rise in Islamic extremism?GUILFOYLE: The rise of it. He's not doing enough to stop it, so of course, it's growing exponentially, because we're in stand-down mode. So there you go. So put someone else in the White House, and we'll wrap this up.GUTFELD: Juan, you have a look of perplexing confusion.WILLIAMS: I'm listening. I'm listening very carefully, but I've heard this argument from people -- you know, Louis C.K., the comedian, has come out and said things, you know, about Trump being extreme.GUTFELD: That's where I get my political ideas.WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying, Dana said it's polite; it's conversation in polite leftist parlors.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: I think it goes way beyond that. You know, I think people think that, when you don't say something about the birther argument which came from Trump, when you don't say something about condemning the man in very negative tones as a Muslim. He's been lying to us. He's not a -- he's not a Christian.And then you say, ""Well, you know what? In the talk radio world, we'll just say this. It's just Obama, you know? We'll demonize him. That then when Trump springs up and becomes your leading Republican candidate, I think other Republicans do have some response.GUTFELD: OK. But see, your point that you're making, you didn't have to use the metaphor of radical Islam. Your point is actually, yes, you can say that. The rhetoric from cable -- cable news and from the rhetoric from talk radio could have contributed to the creation of Trump. Yes, makes sense. Maybe. But comparing it to radical Islam, the rise of -- that's where you lose me.WILLIAMS: Well, and this is where you lose people on the Hitler analogy, right? That Hitler killed thousands of people and the Islamists are killing thousands of people. I don't see Donald Trump doing that. Now, we have an immediate over.GUILFOYLE: Whoa! Thank God. A reason of reason and sanity. Thank God.WILLIAMS: We have a controversy on the table right now. I think there are lots in the Jewish community who did not like Trump raising his hand and having everybody else in the audience raise their hands. And they -- I'm just saying, I'm reading this in the forward and elsewhere. They compare it to a -- you know, a kind of Hitler salute.GUTFELD: All right. All right. By the way, Erin Andrews is therefore also a Nazi, because she had to raise her right hand when she swore into her big lawsuit.WILLIAMS: I'll laugh with you, Eric.BOLLING: Is she a Nazi for doing that?WILLIAMS: Eric, I'm laughing but there's a serious conversation.GUILFOYLE: I know, but really? What are you saying? That Trump is like Hitler and doing Nazi signs?GUTFELD: We have to move on. We have ""The Fastest Seven.""GUILFOYLE: This is ridiculous.GUTFELD: ... which means we need seven minutes.GUILFOYLE: This is, like, so stupid.GUTFELD: All right. Kimberly, enough.GUILFOYLE: I can't.GUTFELD: Go sit -- go sit upstairs!All right. Up next, Clinton supporters have a surprising theory on why they think their candidate's trustworthiness numbers are down. The Hillary blame game is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Trust. It's been a huge issue for Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign, but don't blame Hillary: it's not her fault. It's our fault here at FOX News. Take a listen to what former Michigan governor and campaign supporter Jennifer Granholm said when asked about Clinton's poor poll numbers on the honesty issue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENNIFER GRANHOLM (D), FORMER GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN: This notion of her being untrustworthy, et cetera. They will continue to put millions of dollars -- and I just hope Democrats are not influenced by that.And I think that when -- you know, FOX -- FOX is the biggest purveyor of that myth. And I think that we've got to be careful on our side not to buy into what the Republicans want us to buy into.ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Well, I mean, but just...(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Wow! Wow! Where do I start? Gregory, I mean, the numbers, the poll numbers would indicate it's an issue.GUTFELD: Four in ten Democrats say Hillary is dishonest. I think that's rather low. That means 60 percent think she's honest. I want to get a mailing list of those people for my multi-level marketing scheme, because they truly are gullible. Blaming FNC for Hillary's trust issue is like blaming CNN for Trump Steaks. It's a complete non-sequitur. It's idiotic. They're just whining.WILLIAMS: All right. So I'm going to put Dana on the spot. Dana, if I am a Hillary Clinton supporter and I say, ""But FOX does play up the issue. The issue may be real, but FOX hammers Hillary on this honesty issue.""PERINO: FOX knows what news is and therefore does the news story that nobody else is doing. I think that's good.But it's not just Republican that think that or people that are watching FOX. In the exit polls that we have been analyzing over these last few weeks, Juan, the Bernie Sanders voters, it's almost about 78 percent of Bernie Sanders voters say that she is not honest. So it's not just a Republican thing.WILLIAMS: Eric, how do you feel?BOLLING: FBI. FOX has nothing to do with the FBI, right? They're the once investigating Hillary Clinton.WILLIAMS: Well, no, they're investigating the use of her server.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.BOLLING: Because we suggested it, though, right?WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: OK. So Jennifer Granholm, to her credit, is one of the most liberal people on the planet. Kimberly, remember when she spoke at the 2012 convention, when you listened to her, it was like, ""Where is she coming from with this?"" But to blame FOX for Hillary Clinton's trust issues is a joke.WILLIAMS: What do you think, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: I mean, obviously, it's ludicrous. Right? We get that. I mean, obviously, it has nothing to do with that she's the one that has these problems. There's a real criminal investigation that's about her, Juan. So quit trying to sanitize it. You're like the new Mr. Clean.WILLIAMS: I'm all for -- I'm all for the fact there's an investigation.GUILFOYLE: A criminal investigation.WILLIAMS: It's not at her. That's all I'm saying.GUILFOYLE: I don't know, Juan.GUTFELD: ... criminal, Juan?WILLIAMS: Tell me.GUTFELD: Everybody keeps talking about the gender gap, about how, like, the Democrats have all these women. She has no men. And why is that? Why is it that there's no men? That the Democrats are now losing men to the Republican Party?It's because it's the only group that they don't -- it's the only identity group that she leaves out, are men. She doesn't care about men's concerns. And it's a sin of omission. And I think that's actually hurting her more than anything.WILLIAMS: I'll tell you -- I'm going to tell you my perception, which was influenced last night by what happened on ""Special Report,"" where you had Sanders for half an hour and then Hillary Clinton. I thought, in fact, for the first time as a Democrat, you heard them pressed on some key issues that Democrats wanted answers like the abortion. Like the abortion question, right? I don't think that's necessary -- you can say they asked them that question to embarrass them. I think you know what? People want to know the answers, so you answer the question. You know, I mean, Bret Baier asks the question. He doesn't answer the question. But I think it was very...GUILFOYLE: He did an outstanding job. That was fantastic, and they should be encouraged by that, to see how well they were treated fairly with intelligent questions. And don't shy away from it. Come on here. We have all the viewers.GUTFELD: It was OK.GUILFOYLE: Well, you know.WILLIAMS: By the way -- by the way, he also pressed her on the email stuff, on the FBI stuff. She had her own explanation. But again, I don't think that's the fact that you have political antagonist questions. I just think that's Hillary's issue.Stay tuned, because ""The Fastest Seven"" is coming right at you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back. Time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: Fastest 7(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: ... a legitimate ""Fastest Seven Minutes on Television."" Three enticing stories, seven ephemeral minutes, one enigmatic host.First up, Caitlyn Jenner debuted a new season of her show, ""I Am Cait,"" and got right into presidential politics. Jenner, a longtime Republican, had this to say about one Hillary Rodham Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What are those things, you're open to?CAITLYN JENNER, REALITY TV STAR: I know. I know. We need both sides.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right. We need both sides.JENNER: And we're unfortunate enough to get Hillary as our next president, we need her on our side.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.JENNER: She won't be. She could care less about women. She cares about herself.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Which Republican candidate do you think will be most supportive of transgender people?JENNER: All of them.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Jenner also defended Republicans, saying they don't hate trans people or gays and that their focus is on the economy, Greg.GUTFELD: I've said before she should run as the first transpres. Or as the V.P. on the Republican ticket. Imagine if she were on with Trump and you combined it, the reality show audiences together. Make America Cait again. How does that work? How could you not vote for that ticket? It would be amazing.BOLLING: Several boxes would be checked.GUTFELD: That's true.BOLLING: Dana, your thoughts on Jenner being a Republican.PERINO: I think she is speaking her mind, but I think she should be aware that the women's magazines are going to have to make a choice. And when it comes down to Hillary Clinton or Caitlyn Jenner, believe me, the cover stories for Caitlyn Jenner will dry up like that.BOLLING: Why is Caitlyn Jenner not a Democrat? Why is she so solidly on the conservative side, the Republican side, Juan?WILLIAMS: She's rich.BOLLING: Oh! Cares about -- cares about taxes, the economy.WILLIAMS: Yes, apparently. That's all she cares -- but I don't...PERINO: People -- moderates (ph) can't be conservative?WILLIAMS: I'm just listening here. I'm thinking what about social conservatives? I don't think social conservatives are all that hot about Caitlyn Jenner. Why are we listening to her?BOLLING: Because she said Republicans aren't anti-transgender.GUILFOYLE: And that's true; 100 percent correct, Caitlyn. So fine. Speak your mind. Say what you want. It doesn't have to be about the dollars. This is maybe what she actually believes. She may have changed her gender. She didn't reassign her politics.BOLLING: There you go. Stay right there, K.G.Last night, during her show, a Tennessee jury awarded Erin Andrews, a FOX Sports commentator, $55 million in a stalker case. Andrews was looking for 75 large, but I'm sure she's going to be happy with 55 million smackeroos - - K.G.GUILFOYLE: Mine aren't -- mine aren't any good.BOLLING: Twenty-eight from the stalker. He probably doesn't have $28 million.GUILFOYLE: Obviously not, but I guess it's symbolic. What I like is the message that says that, like, stalking doesn't pay. All of you out there know who you are. OK? Mine aren't any good.WILLIAMS: I got -- I got in trouble today, because I just -- I don't understand this decision. I mean, obviously, she was embarrassed, humiliated. But that much money? But then everybody said to me at the table, mostly women, that I was insensitive.And then I read in The New York Daily News that says here this guy got choked to death. He got 5 million bucks. Another guy gets killed. He gets 5 million bucks. She got $55. She's alive.GUILFOYLE: Well, if he's killed, he's not, like, enjoying it.WILLIAMS: But his family.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: Dana, your thoughts on Erin.PERINO: I would say this is the justice system at work. This was a jury that made this decision. It wasn't an arbitrary decision. And I'm not -- I don't want to make fun of her for asking for that kind of money. Obviously, she's distraught. You see here she's had a really tough time and the jury decided.So I guess one of the things that you keep in mind is that, you know, Nashville juries are going to side with plaintiffs if the evidence presents itself and the reward big.BOLLING: Greg, where are you on this?GUTFELD: Obviously, I have to -- I -- obviously, this was a horrible thing that happened to her. But you can hear the ""but"" coming. In context, airlines in America give maybe $70,000 to each victim's families of a crash. Seventy thousand dollars when you lose a parent or a child in a plane crash.PERINO: Terrible.GUTFELD: That's the context that I think about when I hear this.BOLLING: OK. This one. Finally, my pal Geraldo Rivera -- yes, the same one who foolishly wanted to go outside with me and fight a couple times -- made a big announcement on ""GMA."" Here's my caliente colleague.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC: He's won an Emmy. He's won a Peabody. But he did get his start here on ""GMA.""UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's right. It is Geraldo Rivera and his partner, Edyta Sliwinska!(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Terrible.BOLLING: This all means, does this represent a prediction about the outcome. But Geraldo showed me some of his moves last week in ""The O'Reilly Factor"" green room. He's not too bad, actually, in all sincerity. Good luck to my friend, Geraldo here.GUILFOYLE: I think he's going to be fantastic. I'm super excited to watch him. If you know Geraldo like we all do, he puts his heart one hundred percent into everything. I predict he will be in, like, the last two final standing.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.  With just over two weeks until Election Day, can Donald Trump close the gap after the final debate?  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  One of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power.  Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.  I'll keep you in suspense.  WALLACE:  Today, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on Trump's allegations the election is rigged.  HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  What he said tonight is part of his whole effort to blame somebody else for his campaign and for where he stands in this election.  WALLACE:  And Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook on new WikiLeaks revelations.  Plus, a debate between former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Congressman Xavier Becerra, a Clinton backer, on some of the issues we didn't get specifics on at this week's debate.  Then, things get even nastier at a charity dinner.  TRUMP:  Here she is tonight in public pretending not to hate Catholics.  CLINTON:  Donald really is as healthy as a horse, you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.  WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel where the race goes from here.  All right now on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  With 16 days to go, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are entering the final phase of this campaign.  With the debates finally over, both are barn-storming through swing states this weekend.  Today, we'll speak with both sides' campaign managers, Robby Mook with the Clinton campaign.  But first, Kellyanne Conway live in Trump Tower.  Kellyanne, you're a professional pollster.  So, let's start there with the numbers, which quite frankly don't look very good for Donald Trump at this point.  Let me put some of them up on the screen.  In a four-way race, he now trails Clinton by more than five points.  Among women, he trails by 15 points.  And that's important because women are voting early in big numbers in Florida and North Carolina.  Kellyanne, how do you turn this around in two weeks?  KELLYANNE CONWAY, DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Thanks for having me, Chris.  So, by taking the case directly to the voters.  That's where he is.  He's in three states yesterday.  He'll be in Florida for a few days.  And we look at some of the early voting returns in places like Iowa and Ohio, and we're doing much better than previous candidates, in large part because we invested in the absentee ballot early voting procedures.  And also, I think he does it in a way that he gave the speech in Gettysburg yesterday.  He puts out that nine or ten-point plan, has some really significant measures with teeth to have lifetime bans on lobbying for our nation to be working in his White House, term limits for members of Congress, and he'll drain the swamp --  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Kellyanne, didn't he -- didn't he step on his serious agenda for the first hundred days by beginning the speech saying that he's going to sue all the women who have accused him?  CONWAY:  No, he's just trying to defend himself against false accusers, as he said.  He said those incidents never happened, yet they're covered in the media every single day.  He can't get fair coverage.  Maybe not here, Chris, but he can't get fair coverage of his substantive points in many corners.  And yet, they imbue credibility to others automatically.  We like the fact that in three major national polls, he's leading Hillary Clinton now by a few points.  And we like the fact that in the eight swing states where President Obama beat Governor Romney in 2012, we are either ahead, within the margin of error, or win striking distance.  So, we'll be visiting all of the states --WALLACE:  Let me just pick up on that, because I want to look at the electoral map, which doesn't look good at this point.  Here are the swing states that your campaign has long identified as must wins.  Ohio, basically tied.  North Carolina, Clinton up three.  Florida, Clinton up four.  And then, there are the flip states.  The blue state of Pennsylvania, which you are hoping to flip to Trump, Clinton is up six, and the traditionally red state of Arizona, Clinton now up 1 1/2.Question, where is the realistic path to 270 electoral votes?  CONWAY:  She's still under 50 everywhere, and she spent $56 million in ads, mostly negative, politics of personal destruction ads against Donald Trump just in September, Chris.  So, with all that on the field, we're just starting to increase some of our investments on the air.  You'll see Mr. Trump there.  So, the fact it's been three points, four points, six points is what can turn around in these next two weeks.  Our path is Florida, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina.  You add Nevada, you protect Arizona and Georgia, you look at New Hampshire and Maine, too, where the congressional districts there are split in the way they award their electoral votes.  And then, we're also going to continue to visit Colorado, Virginia, Pennsylvania.  So, there are several different -- a poll came out yesterday showing us six down in Michigan.  We haven't even been there.  We're not up on the air there.  And so, the fact is that this race is not over.  Many in the media want to say it's over for the 12th time, they're counting Donald Trump out.  And I'm telling you that in some of these polls, if you're only using listed sample and you're identifying people who voted Republican in 2012 or voted Democrat in 2012, and you're not really bringing in people who haven't voted in a long time, the lapse voters or the first-time voters who are truly enthusiastic about Donald Trump as an outsider trying to really shake up the system.  And there are many people like that.  He's not -- we're not giving up.  We know we can win this.  And we are certainly not exceeding to the same chattering class that's been wrong about Donald Trump for about a year and a half.  WALLACE:  There are suggestions you have grown uncomfortable with Donald Trump and his campaign.  From our personal experience, you were pulled twice from this show around the time that there were all these allegations about women saying that he had groped them.  You've also been active on social media.  I want to put this up.  You retweeted this comment from reporter Robert Costa, The Washington Post, at the debate, ""Bad hombres, Trump being Trump.  Trump's other answers, Conway-esque.""  Why would you want to retweet that?  CONWAY:  I retweeted it because I was so excited that Donald Trump for the first time in the 20-some years I've been working on pro-life messaging actually in front of tens of millions of people worldwide gave the most impassioned defense of life that I've ever heard from a Republican presidential candidate.  It was amazing to hear him say --WALLACE:  Yes, but basically, what Costa was saying was the bad stuff was Trump and the good stuff was you.  CONWAY:  That's not true.  He made one comment.  It was early in the debate, Chris, if you remember.  And so, the Conway-esque stuff, which was pro-life messaging I've been working on for decades.  If you never get frankly people who say they're much more life than Donald Trump -- Donald Trump used to be pro-choice.  Like many Americans, he's changed his views, based on personal experience as he's explained.  And there he was on the stage with you, doing two things nobody had ever done, and it is Conway-esque.  One is saying, ""I'm pro-life, I will appoint pro-life judges.""  And then taking the case right to Hillary Clinton that her and her party are for abortion, anyone, anytime, anywhere.  They're incredibly extreme -- sex selection abortion, fetal pain abortion, taxpayer funded abortion, and, of course, late-term abortion.  Donald Trump said on live TV in front of you that Hillary Clinton would rip the baby from the womb, that it's OK to have a late-term abortion.  She had a terrible defense to that, that somehow it's because of the life of the mother.  And people say, well, there aren't that many.  There are 12,000 a year.  Americans ought to know that's part of being pro-choice.  So, I was very excited.  Let me tell you something.  A lot of Republicans just hide under the desk hoping the abortion shrapnel won't hit them and there was none other than a Manhattan billionaire giving impassioned defense of pro-life.  It's as simple as that.I think people read a little too much into it.  And, frankly, a lot of people lack my sense of humor on some of these other tweets.  But I -- but Donald Trump and I both have a great sense of humor and a wonderful relationship.  I've never been pulled from a Sunday show.  I'll just leave it at that.  WALLACE:  Well, just real quickly, the fact was we were told as recently as like a Saturday night that you were going to be doing our show at the height of the whole scandal.  And then, suddenly, Rudy Giuliani showed up the next morning.  And you don't look like Rudy Giuliani.  (LAUGHTER)CONWAY:  I love the mayor.  It doesn't mean I was pulled.  But in any event, if you see me sitting here as a campaign manager, then that's where my heart and my head are.  And, you know, a lot of things go into being this campaign manager, a lot of people here relying upon me as their leader -- a lot of our state directors, our ground game, our field operation.  I work closely with Chairman Priebus and the RNC.  And we just -- you know, Donald Trump and I have a great relationship.  I think he's unfairly maligned by many people who should really look at the full measure of the man.  He's employed thousands of women at the Trump Corporation.WALLACE:  Kellyanne --  CONWAY:  He's the first Republican to elevate a woman as a campaign manager presidentially.  That says an awful lot about him.  WALLACE:  Kellyanne, we're going to have to leave it there.  Thank you so much for joining us today.  CONWAY:  Thank you.  WALLACE:  Now to Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.  Robby, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.ROBBY MOOK, HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Thanks more having me.  WALLACE:  We just talked to Kellyanne Conway about how strong you guys appear to be in the polls.  At this point, are you looking past 270 electoral votes to try to run up the score, one, so you can say Clinton won a mandate, and two, to try to win a Democratic House and Senate?  MOOK:  Well, Chris, every presidential campaign has to work to get to that 270 number.  And we're not taking anything for granted at all.  So, that's still our focus and our goal.  Secretary Clinton at the beginning of this campaign said she wanted to help all candidates up and down the ballot.  So, we're running a coordinated campaign, working hard with gubernatorial, Senate, and House candidates.  But we're not -- you know, this is not over yet.  And battleground states are called battleground states for a reason.  That's because they're going to be close.  We expect them all to be won or lost by a point or two.  And we're working very hard on the ground to turn out the vote.  WALLACE:  But aren't you widening the map in these final two weeks?  We see you going into traditionally Republican states like Indiana and Missouri and even Arizona.  I mean, you are widening the map, clearly.  Is that at least in part to try to push back in case Trump tries to claim that this election is rigged?  MOOK:  Well, every campaign wants to win by the biggest margin possible.  So that would be great.  The reason that we've gone into Arizona is that it has come into play.  Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric, the shameful things he said about POWs and specifically about John McCain, have put that state into play.  We think we can win it, so we're doing everything we can.  There are important Senate and governors' races in Indiana and Missouri.  We've put in some resources to help there.  But we're not running away with this.  This race is going to be competitive up until the end.  What I find very encouraging is we have seen first a record in voter registration.  Over 200 million people across this country are now registered to vote, which is great.  And we're seeing record turnout numbers.  Just yesterday in Nevada, we saw record turnout in Clark County for the first day of early voting.  We're seeing eye-popping vote by mail application numbers.  WALLACE:  And let me just ask quickly about that.  You know, we act as if this all happens on Election Day, November 8th.  You've banked a lot of votes already.  And we see women turning out in large numbers in North Carolina and Florida.  Do you have a sense of what kind of strength you're in at this point?  MOOK:  We feel very, very good about what we've seen so far.  We predict that this is going to be the biggest election in American history.  More people are going to turn out than ever before.  And we're encouraged also by who is turning out.  We are very proud of the ground game we've built.  We see it delivering the results we expected.  And as you touched upon, we believe over 40 percent of voters in the background states are going to turn out before Election Day.  So, this election is happening as we speak.  And that ground game is there, pushing our people out.  WALLACE:  I want to take you back to a question I asked Secretary Clinton about the Clinton Foundation during the debate, a question I have to say I don't think she really answered.  Here she is.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?  CLINTON:  Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.  The State Department has said that.  I think that's been proven.  But I am happy -- in fact, I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  And then she went on and I had to interrupt her.  There was a new revelation this week that Hillary Clinton was involved in trying to get a $12 million donation to the foundation from the king of Morocco.  Why wasn't that classic pay to play?  MOOK:  Well, first of all, it's not news that the Clinton Global Initiative had their meeting in Morocco.  Everybody knew that.  It's also not news that Hillary Clinton didn't go to it.  That was in the e-mails as well.  So, there's nothing new here.  And Donald Trump is trying to attack Secretary Clinton on this because, as you said, he's down in the polls.  He's struggling.  And as Secretary Clinton said, we're glad to put her foundation up against his any day.  WALLACE:  But, Robby, there is some new stuff.  We have gotten e-mails that indicate what was going on.  This was happening in 2015, just as she was about to announce her campaign for president, and the e-mails show -- and I'm going to go through some of them.  You were not happy at all the idea of this meeting and her going there at that particular point.January 18th e-mail from Huma Abedin to you, ""It will break a lot of china to back out now when we have so many opportunities to do it in the past few months.  She,"" Clinton, ""created this mess, and she knows it.""  Same day you write, ""HRC is still considering.""March 24th, you to John Podesta, ""Huma said it was still happening then said she's going to cancel at the last minute, but it sounded a little tentative.  Just sounded more up in the air than I thought it was.""You didn't want this huge contribution from the king of Morocco just as Clinton was announcing for president.  MOOK:  Well, I didn't want anything on her schedule that was going to distract from the campaign.  Again, the Clinton Global Initiative had this meeting scheduled in Morocco --WALLACE:  But it was the big money from a foreign person to the foundation at the time she's running for president.  MOOK:  This was, as you can see in those e-mails, a scheduling matter.  We didn't want her going overseas.  I didn't want her going overseas before the campaign was kicking off.  But again, this is -- these are stolen documents, stolen by the Russians.  It's now confirmed from John Podesta, being put out for exactly this purpose.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Can I speak to that?  Well, let me just speak to that, though, because, you know, the Trump tax returns were stolen as well when they were mailed to The New York Times. You guys didn't object to that.  In fact, you jumped all over them.  MOOK:  Well, we don't know where those tax returns came from.  WALLACE:  Well, they weren't -- they were clearly stolen.  MOOK:  We don't know and you have to --  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Do you think Trump had given them?  MOOK:  I don't know.  I don't know how they got to The New York Times.WALLACE:  I guess what I'm saying, if that -- if we're looking at the fruits of that theft, and I will call it a theft, it's fair to look at the fruits of your theft.  MOOK:  Well, I think what's particularly disturbing in this situation is that the intelligence community has now confirmed that John Podesta's e-mails and the DNC e-mails were stolen by the Russians.  WALLACE:  I know about the Russian connection.  I'm talking about the $12 million from the king of Morocco and the fact that this continues to sort of show the line between private and public and Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.  MOOK:  I think we've got to look at what decisions were made.  There was a meeting in Morocco.  Secretary Clinton decided not to go, focus on her campaign here.  And again, we're having --WALLACE:  But then Bill Clinton and Chelsea Clinton went.  Correct?  MOOK:  My understanding is they did go.  But she did not.  Again, this is the discussion the Russians want us to be having.  They stole this information.  They're selectively leaking.  I can't even verify any of the information that you have there.  We simply don't have enough time as a campaign --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  I promise you, if these were not true, you'd tell us.  MOOK:  And we are trying to go through some of them as we can.  But we don't have time to go through them all.  And again, this is a distraction put in place by the Russian government at the suggestion and encouragement of Donald Trump.  That should be a chilling fact for every single American.  WALLACE:  Robby, thank you.  Thanks for your time today.  Coming up, there were some key issues I didn't get to with Trump and Clinton Wednesday night.  We'll continue that debate with two of their top supporters, next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A look outside the Beltway at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where this weekend Donald Trump outlined the agenda for his first hundred days, if he's elected.Well, this is the book that I brought to Wednesday's debate filled with hundreds of hours of research.  But we didn't get to all the topics and figuring good debate topics are a terrible thing to waste, we want to continue the conversation now with former Speaker Newt Gingrich, one of Trump's advisers, and author of the new book, ""Treason"", and key Clinton advocate, Democratic Congressman Xavier Becerra.Gentlemen, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""One subject that we discussed in the debate was immigration, where Trump and Clinton are sharply divided.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.  We need strong borders.  CLINTON:  I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But we didn't get to the issue which I was planning to of sanctuary cities, cities that limit their assistance to federal immigration officials on people who are in this country illegally.  Donald Trump would cut off federal subsidies to those cities.  Hillary Clinton supports those cities.  Debate your differences.  REP. XAVIER BECERRA, D-CALIFORNIA:  Chris, I will simply say that Hillary Clinton has a record when it comes to tough border enforcement and enforcement in our cities as well.  WALLACE:  But I'm talking about sanctuary cities.  BECERRA:  But sanctuary cities don't stop you from going after the criminals, the folks that are trying to do us harm.  Sanctuary cities simply says we're not going to focus on going after the women in the grocery store or picking up their kids from school.  We should be focused on going after those who are trying to do us harm.  And that's all the sanctuary cities talk about.  Going after sanctuary cities, as Republicans have, would deny our local law enforcement the resources they need to actually continue to go after criminals on the streets.  And that's why many of us have opposed the Republicans' efforts to try to undo funding for cities that have sanctuary city policies to protect women and children.  WALLACE:  Speaker Gingrich?  NEWT GINGRICH, R-FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER:  Well, I mean, first of all, since Secretary Clinton basically doesn't intend to enforce the law nationally, why should she care if cities enforce the law?  She has said openly that she had -- her dream was of a western hemisphere without borders.  In that circumstance, sanctuary cities wouldn't need to exist because you have a sanctuary country.There's a huge difference between Trump's desire to control the border, her desire to open the border.  And I think the sanctuary city issue is just part of that.But my impression -- I mean, Congressman Becerra knows a great deal more about this than I do.  My impression is, in a number of cities, they will not turn people over to the federal government, even if they're picked up for criminal violations.  WALLACE:  Let me talk about one specific case that got a lot of attention.  That, of course, was the case of Kate Steinle in your state of California, who was shot to death last year in San Francisco.  Her accused killer had been deported five times, but he was back in the U.S.GINGRICH:  Right.BECERRA:  And he does not qualify for sanctuary city policy.  That's the point.GINGRICH:  But he did.  BECERRA:  No, he wasn't.  He escaped -- he was able to get away and then he was able to get ahold of a weapon.  But he was under -- he was not under some sanctuary city policy.  By the way, open borders was not a reference to immigration by Secretary Clinton.  It was a reference to energy policy.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Wait, wait.  I got to stop you there.  That was one of the -- I wish I'd had back in the debate.  She talked about a common market with open borders and open trade.  There's no such thing as an electrical common market.  BECERRA:  She talked about the fact our energy policy must go beyond our own borders because otherwise --WALLACE:  No, that wasn't what she said.  She talked about a hemispheric common market.  Nobody talks about common market --BECERRA:  Chris, you and I and Newt can go ahead and decide what we think she said, but she's the one that told us what she said.  She said it.  GINGRICH:  The actual phrase is interesting.  The actual phrase is open trade and open borders.  Now, in that setting --BECERRA:  In reference (ph) to continue to energy policy.  GINGRICH:  But in any event, to go back to the case, as I understand it, the city of San Francisco didn't turn this guy over.  There's a piece on San Diego local TV that runs like seven minutes covering the border right now.  They don't turn people back.  They take them to a trolley car in San Diego.  People actually run up to the police.  One guy who's a border patrolman says the guy runs up and says, ""I really have a bad heart condition, can you put me in the hospital?""WALLACE:  All right.  I also wanted to talk to Trump and Clinton about Obamacare, but somehow we got sidetracked into a debate about TPP and dump Chinese steel.  So, let's talk about Obamacare.  Speaker Gingrich, for all the criticism of the Affordable Care Act, the fact is that 20 million Americans who didn't have health insurance coverage now have health insurance coverage.  What happens to those 20 million people under Trump's repeal and replace?  GINGRICH:  First of all, most of those people are in Medicaid.  They're not in insurance programs that are private.  Second, a lot of people are in insurance programs and are going to be out of them by next year.  WALLACE:  But they're only in Medicaid because Medicaid was expanded under this.  GINGRICH:  So, Medicaid is expanded.  That (INAUDIBLE) simple government program to expand.  WALLACE:  So, Trump would continue with the expanded Medicaid?  GINGRICH:  I suspect nobody will be kicked off in the transition.  But the people that are going to be kicked off now are people who cannot afford the scale of the increase in premiums and the scale of the increase in deductions.  This is the unaffordable care act.  It's a joke to say it's the Affordable Care Act.  WALLACE:  But what's the plan to protect those people?  GINGRICH:  I think the plan will probably involve a fairly large tax credit to enable them to buy private insurance.  BECERRA:  Chris, there we go.  Six years after we passed the Affordable Care Act and 20 million people now have coverage, this is the plan.  It's not a plan.  Suspicions about what you think will happen aren't going to get people access to a doctor or a hospital.  People used to go broke having to file bankruptcy because they had taken their son or daughter to a doctor or a hospital.  That's no longer the case for people who have insurance.  Twenty million people today have the security of knowing they don't have to wait until their child is so sick they can go to the emergency room.  WALLACE:  But, Congressman Becerra, you would certainly have to agree, Bill Clinton said Obamacare right now does have serious problems, big insurance companies are pulling out of a lot of states.  There's almost no choice in a lot of the markets.  Premiums are going up an average of 9 percent.  But in some places, 20 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent.  Secretary Clinton is saying let's let people under 55 buy into Medicare and let's put out a public option.  So, it seems that her answer is let's let government have a bigger role or maybe the role in health care.  BECERRA:  Well, remember, what she's said is we can make improvements on what has already given 20 million Americans coverage.  We have more Americans covered today than ever before.  And what we can do is continue to make progress based on a system that relies on the private sector, not on our government.  WALLACE:  She's talking about a public option.  BECERRA:  For those states, there are many states where the private sector is not going in rural areas especially where a public option absolutely would make a difference because it gives Americans more choice.  But rather than throw away everything you've got and go back to the days of pre-existing conditions when you could not get coverage, let's --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Let me wrangle this one.  GINGRICH:  First of all, I think the term that President Clinton used was crazy.  He said this is a crazy scheme.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Well, in fairness, he was only talking about specific problems there.  Not the whole thing.  (CROSSTALK)GINGRICH:  Right.  But the specific problem in the end is you have a program that's not affordable.  There's not enough money.  You have insurance companies dropping out.  Hillary in one of her secret speeches said she really likes the Canadian model, which is a government-run system.  BECERRA:  Newt, what's the plan?  What's the plan?  GINGRICH:  I think the plan has to be to go back to making it possible to have competitive choices, and the plan has to be frankly to take a lot of the cost out of health care.  BECERRA:  OK, how?  It's great to say, but we have to do it.  Show me how you do it.  Republicans have six years.  They haven't come up with a plan.  (CROSSTALK)GINGRICH:  I think the first easy step will be a big war politically.  It's malpractice insurance.  Look at the amount of defensive medicine practice in this country.  It drives up the cost.  What you're trying to do is say we can have an endless increase in cost but it will be affordable --BECERRA:  So, you wait until the doctor has done something wrong to sue for malpractice.  That doesn't get you -- that doesn't make you well.  WALLACE:  That's true.  It doesn't make you well.  Finally, Speaker Gingrich, running out of time here, you've been speaking recently about big Trump and little Trump.  And big Trump, you say, is a man who's espousing historic change.  And little Trump, you say, is, your words, petty and pathetic.  Can we afford to have a president with such a split personality?  GINGRICH:  Look, of course, you can.  I think we had a number of presidents who had interesting challenges in their personality.  But the question is, I'm willing to concede that Trump on occasion is crass, but I'd like my opponents to concede that Hillary on occasion is corrupt.  I mean, you have a candidate for president who under any reasonable standard would have been indicted.  You look at what just happened to General Cartwright.  You have a candidate -- you just raised this with Robby Mook, you have a candidate for president who is cheerfully dealing with foreign governments for $12 million donations.  She's surrounded by staff who are basically saying take the money.  That's what's going to walk in the White House.  So, Trump is not perfect, but she sure ain't perfect either, and she's a much greater threat to our system than Donald Trump is.  WALLACE:  Speaker Gingrich, Congressman Becerra, we're going to have to leave it there.  Thank you, both.  And it's always good to moderate your -- I think I had a little more control here.  I think we got some answers, you know?  Like I said, debate questions are a terrible thing to waste.  Thank you, both.  BECERRA:  Thank you.  WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the state of the race after the final debate.  Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about Trump's refusal to say he'll respect the results of the election?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, first Trump said he'll keep us in suspense. Then --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election -- if I win.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday group about that, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I ask a simple question. She's been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?CLINTON: On the day when I was in the situation room monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting ""The Celebrity Apprentice.""(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump arguing at Wednesday's debate who has more valuable experience to be our next president.And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, bob Woodward of The Washington Post, and Kimberley Strassel from The Wall Street Journal.Well, Karl, the conventional wisdom is that Trump was having a pretty good debate until he refused to say that he would accept the results of the election. Do you agree with both parts of that premise?KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR: I -- I do because, look, what matters is not just simply the debate, but the aftermath of the debate. And he guaranteed that all that good work that he did in prosecuting the case that he was the agent of change and she was the status quo was wiped out in the controversy that -- that came as a result of his answer to that question. And it -- and it continued for several days more. I mean, the -- the next day he compounds it by saying at a rally, I believe in North Carolina, I'll -- I'll accept the outcome if I win, guaranteeing that the story would go on for yet another day.WALLACE:  And -- and why is that such a big deal? Because people are saying, well, look, in 2000, in which you were familiar with, and -- and allegations of fraud, what -- why is it such a big deal way in advance of president -- or a presidential candidate saying, I -- I -- no, I don't commit to respecting the results?ROVE: Because as long as we've had our republic, we have had a peaceful transition of power. Now, there -- there have been moments of acrimony and division, 1876, 2000. But we have had this great tradition of the peaceful transition of power.Now, look, I want to say something about the hypocrisy of some Democrats on this. The elect -- the night of the debate, one of the most ardent voices on this was the Reverend Jesse Jackson, the ever valuable (ph), ever heard from Jesse Jackson, who said, how dare he do this. Well, he was the guy who even after the Supreme Court acted in 2000 and -- and -- and -- and ended the election controversy said Bush is not the legitimately elected president of the United States. I would remind people it was the Democratic House leader, Dick Gephardt, who refused to say Bush was the -- was the legitimately elected president of the United States, even in December of 2000. And we have dead-enders like Paul Begala and other who still go around and say Bush was not the legitimately elected president. So Democrats ought to be a little careful before they sort of evolpe (ph) themselves in hypocrisy.WALLACE:  (INAUDIBLE) the dead-enders. The image of Paul Begala coming out of a cave in the Philippines somewhere.ROVE: Exactly. Exactly.WALLACE:  All right, we asked you for questions for the panel and we got a bunch on this topic. And especially the coverage of Trump's answer. Philip tweeted this. ""Considering the DNC history of voter fraud schemes, isn't it wise for Trump to wait for the election results to be verified?""Kim, how do you answer Philip?KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: You know, I think this argument that Trump is making is -- is also a mistake, that there is widespread voter fraud, that this is rigged. It's a very dangerous argument to make. I mean there is always some amount of fraud out there. There -- we can't ever be perfectly certain with elections. But to go that far, you're suggesting that there's the giant plot to stop him from becoming president. And -- and it -- and it goes along with the not accepting peaceful transition of power.That all being said, I think that Trump is on to something with his broader claim about the system being rigged. Not from an electoral perspective, but this is something a lot of Americans really do feel. You know, they look out there, they -- they see an Obamacare system in which they're doubling their premiums, but Congress doesn't have to take part. They see an IRS that has never held accountable for targeting tens of thousands of Americans. They see a Hillary Clinton FBI probe in which special deals are cut and she gets treated differently than any other corporate executive in which something likes would have happened. So to the extent he's now making that a theme in his campaign, I don't go so far as the electoral issue, but the rigging resonates.WALLACE:  Then there are the allegations about the Clinton Foundation and pay to play, which I asked Secretary Clinton about in the debate, and she turned into an attack on the Trump Foundation.But, Bob, I want to go back to the conversation I was having with Robby Mook before. When -- when you see what seems to be clear evidence that Clinton Foundation donors were being treated differently than non-donors in terms of access, when you see this new -- new revelation about the $12 million deal between Hillary Clinton, the foundation, and the king of Morocco, are voters right to be troubled by this?BOB WOODWARD, THE WASHINGTON POST: I -- yes, it's a -- it's corrupt. It's -- it's a scandal. And she didn't answer your question at all. And she turned to embrace the good work that the Clinton Foundation has done. And she has a case there. But the mixing of speech fees, the Clinton Foundation, and actions by the State Department, which she ran, are all intertwined and it's corrupt. You know, I mean, you can't just say it's unsavory. But there's no formal investigation going on now, and there are outs that they have.But the election isn't going to be decided on that. I mean Karl was making the point about this, I'm not going to observe the result of the election. I mean that's -- that's absurd. I mean it has no consequence. If Trump loses, they're not going to let him in the White House. He's not going to have a transition team. And -- and to focus on that, I think, is wrong. I think the issue is, what's going to be the aftermath of this campaign. Can somebody govern in --WALLACE:  We're going to -- we're going to talk about that in the next segment.WOODWARD: OK.WALLACE:  But I want to bring Juan in because we learned from -- from e-mails from the -- and these were e-mails that the Republican National Committee got through the Freedom of Information Act. These aren't the hacked e-mails. This isn't the fruit of Russia trying to undermine our election. That foundation donors seeking government grants for Haiti relief were being treated differently, being considered separately from non-donors. Does that trouble you?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Sure it would. But, I mean, the fact is, in that case, which has been cited by Mike Pence -- in fact, what the State Department officials said is, hey, some of these people are friends of the Clintons. But, guess what, the bottom line, they didn't get the contracts for Haiti. But to your larger --WALLACE:  Some -- some of them did.WILLIAMS: Yes, but it's very few. So it's not the case that play --WALLACE:  Well, I know but did -- but any --WALLACE:  The Clintons were giving (ph) these contracts, which is the heart of the suggestion.But let me just say, when you're talking politically, we're two weeks out from the election, is trust and honesty a vulnerability for Hillary Clinton? I don't think there's any question. I think it stirs Donald Trump's base. Lock her up. You know, Trump the blank, you know. I'm saying that's the heart.WALLACE:  But -- but I'm actually saying the politics of it. Kim, I mean, let's talk about the substance of what was going on there.STRASSEL: Yes, look, you have to go back and remember what was happening here. This is 2010. The earthquake. The Clinton Foundation is tagged as a lead by the U.N. They are collecting millions of dollars. We know for a fact from books that Peter Schweizer's ""Clinton Cash"" that lots of people who were foundation donors indeed did get contracts in Haiti. And there is a very bad feeling in Haiti against the Clintons. You know, the -- the former senate leader in Haiti called them common thieves. So -- and then you take what we just found in these e-mails and we know that indeed they were segregating. An official at the State Department segregating out people who were considered VIPs of William Jefferson Clinton, special friends of the Clinton Foundation. So we don't --WILLIAMS: There is no evidence, Kimberley, that they were given all of these contracts.ROVE: Yes, there is. Yes, there is. Yes, there is.WILLIAMS: That's just unfair. And I think the idea --ROVE: Juan --WILLIAMS: That you would make an equivalent between what's been going on with Trump and all the of the lies and corruption --WALLACE:  Well, let's -- well, wait -- just talk --WILLIAMS: But, no, that's what I'm saying, you go after --WALLACE:  No, let's just talk about -- let's talk about the foundation.WILLIAMS: You go after the Clintons as if it's the equivalent.ROVE: It is (ph).WILLIAMS: And it's not an equivalent.ROVE: Look --WILLIAMS: And I think the American people, when you look at the favorability numbers on trust, if Clinton is -- is in -- underwater, minus 10, Clinton -- Trump is under 25.WALLACE:  But, honestly, you're pivoting. Juan, you're pivoting. Why don't' you talk about the Clinton Foundation (INAUDIBLE).STRASSEL: Yes, Juan, (INAUDIBLE) --WILLIAMS: I'm glad to, but I'm saying, it's not an equivalent, Chris.STRASSEL: Can I just say this. The other e-mail we were talking about is very clearly spelling out Hillary Clinton said, I will go to Morocco if you give my endowment $12 million.WILLIAMS: She was gone from being secretary of state, Kimberley.STRASSEL: We actually don't know when that --WILLIAMS: She's -- yes, she was.STRASSEL: We don't know when that (INAUDIBLE) --WILLIAMS: Well, no, no, (INAUDIBLE) --WALLACE:  Well, wait, admitting that she was gone from being secretary of state, she was running --WILLIAMS: Thank you.WALLACE:  She was running for president.WILLIAMS: She was considering running for president.WALLACE:  You don't think -- you don't think that the $12 million had something to do with the fact that she was running and was likely to be the next president?ROVE: She (INAUDIBLE) within a month of her announcement.WILLIAMS: Yes, that's what the e-mails reveal, that it was a consideration. But the suggestion is that she made a quid pro quo arrangement --WALLACE:  No. It was --WILLIAMS: Give me the money and I'll show up and give a speech.WALLACE:  Well, that --STRASSEL: Well, that's what the e-mail said.(CROSS TALK)WALLACE:  And she -- and she winds up giving the speech for free.ROVE: Yes. Right, she did.WILLIAMS: But she didn't (ph) show up, did she, Chris?ROVE: She -- she got the money and she ran.WILLIAMS: she didn't show up.ROVE: Look, back in Haiti --WALLACE:  All right, real quick, then we've got to go.ROVE: Back to -- back to Haiti for a second. Look, Digicel (ph) and Dennis Haras (ph), largest Irish contributor to the Clinton Global Foundation gets tens of millions of dollars of USAID. Coracel (ph) Industrial Park, largest single grant goes to Kim -- Wong Kim (ph) of C.A., gets $124 million from the U.S., $100 million from the International Development Bank --WALLACE:  All right.ROVE: And a Clinton donor. There's a broader issue here. Real quick --WALLACE:  Not only a Clinton donor, incidentally. He helped set up Cheryl Mills, the Clinton chief of staff in business (ph).ROVE: In -- in -- in (INAUDIBLE). There's a real issue here, though, just quickly. She -- she committed in January of 2009 to Senator -- Senator Luger (ph) said this. You foundation --WALLACE:  This is a confirmation hearing.ROVE: At her confirmation hearing, this isn't a temptation for any foreign entity or government that believes it can curry favor through a donation. And -- and John Kerry joins with her -- joins with Fluke (ph) and says --WALLACE:  All right.WILLIAMS: Really quickly.WALLACE:  This is a long final statement.ROVE: Look, she made a commitment to avoid these kind of controversies.WALLACE:  Panel, we have to take a break here, but when we come back, does Trump still have a path to win this election?Plus, sparks fly at a charity dinner. So what do you think? Did Trump and Clinton go too far with their jokes? Let me know on Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and use the #fns. We'll keep talking in the meantime.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: It's amazing I'm up here after Donald. I didn't think he'd be OK with a peaceful transition of power.TRUMP: Hillary believes that it's vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private. Here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump trading barbs at the annual Al Smith Dinner, turning what is traditionally some gentle ribbing into something much rougher.And we're back now with the panel.Well, we're going to get to the unusual doings at the dinner a little bit later. But, first, Karl, I want to go over the numbers. You saw some of the numbers that we went over with Kellyanne Conway. There is a new poll out this morning from ABC News and The Washington Post. Let's put it up. It shows Clinton at 50 and Trump at 38. A 12-point jump. That's one of the biggest that I've seen.Karl, that poll, everything else, what is Trump's path to victory now, or doesn't he have one?ROVE: Well, if he plays an inside straight, he could get it, but I doubt that he's going to be able to play it. He has 168 electoral votes in states that he either leads outside of the margin of error. That's -- or -- or is thought comfortably put away. That compares to Romney's 206. That's Romney's states minus Arizona and North Carolina, where he's behind, and plus Iowa, where he's ahead.There's only one other -- he's ahead in Ohio by -- by less than one-tenths of a percent -- by less than one point. That gets him to 214. There's only one other state where he's within four, Florida. That would get him to 243. And everything else ranges from 4.3 to 10 points, all the rest of the battleground states. And he would have to not only win two states where he is either only slightly ahead or behind by four, but he would have to pick up states where he is behind, by, at or above the national average. I don't see it happening.WALLACE:  I'm sorry, you don't?ROVE: I -- I don't see it happening. I mean maybe it could, but I -- I -- I doubt that in -- in -- in the just over two weeks that we've got left, conducting the kind of campaign that he is conducting, that he's going to be able to swing one out of every, you know, ten voters, one out of every 12 voters, one out of every 15 voters in a -- one out of every six voters in a state and convert -- and convert them.WALLACE:  Kim, what about this conversation that I had with Robby Mook that -- that Clinton is in such a commanding position that she may now try to expand the map so run up the score, both so that she can claim a mandate, and also try to turn both the House and the Senate to the Democrats.STRASSEL: Well, she's doing that. She's moving in with ads into Arizona, Missouri, places that are not traditionally areas where Democrats play. They're feeling very confident here. And, yes, that is largely a move to try to get the Senate. I think the House is off limits. It's not going to happen. But, you know, the -- the Senate is on a knife's edge. If she can go in there and flip it, it, at the very least, gives her more ability to put her Supreme Court nominee in place, but also, you know, a little bit more leverage. Now, that's completely aside whether or not she can have a mandate given the campaign that has been run out there. Either of them come into office and have a mandate, because there hasn't been much discussion of issues. But if she has the Senate in her back corner, that's the goal at the moment.WALLACE:  Bob, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ran an interesting ad this week. Let's take a look at it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): America's future is far from certain. But no matter who the next president is, New Hampshire needs a strong voice in the U.S. Senate. That senator, Kelly Ayotte.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  No matter who the next president is. Now, they didn't go all the way to what happened with Bob Dole in 1996, which I'm sure Karl remembers, where by the end the Republicans were running ads basically saying -- for Senate and House races saying, elect our person to be a check against Bill Clinton, but we're headed into that area, aren't we?WOODWARD: Quite possibly. And it -- and it may be over. I'm not totally convinced because I think there are a lot of secret Trump supporters out there who won't even tell pollsters that they're going to vote for him because they think it's a neighbor calling playing a joke. I think the real issue now is, what's going to be the impact on voters after the election. And I -- I think I said to you that there are a group of valium voters, people who talk tough, who really treat all of this as an emotional combat between Trump and Clinton. And actually after the election, they're going to chill out. They may have to self-medicate, but lives are going to go on. And this is not going to be the end of the world. And it's been portrayed as Armageddon, and I'm not sure it -- it is.WALLACE:  Well, for those -- the Armageddon lobby, one of the -- one of the points that they would -- they would cite was the Al Smith dinner, which is usually very dignified, very gentle ribbing, and turned ugly and mean and, frankly, particularly by Trump, and he was openly getting booed, Juan, at a -- at a charity dinner. And I wonder, maybe I'm making too much of this, but, to me, those kind of events are the glue which hold the country together. I don't mean the Al Smith Dinner, but the sort of sense that whatever divides us, that what unites us is -- is bigger. Were you troubled by the Al Smith Dinner and the -- the tone of it?WILLIAMS: Well, at first I was surprised because, like you, I've seen Al Smith Dinners and I've never seen anything like -- I've never seen anybody get booed at an Al Smith Dinner. And, remember, Trump is from Manhattan. A lot of these people are people that he knows very well and the -- I think he thought it was his crowd. I think he misread that crowd. And when he starts off about hate Catholics, that she -- she wants to deceive people, the little bit that you played picks up on the nasty woman line that he used earlier.WALLACE:  So -- so corrupt that she got kicked of the Watergate committee.WILLIAMS: Yes. And he says, you know, after listening to Hillary, Rosie O'Donnell looks better. I mean just -- it just didn't -- it didn't have the right timber. It didn't have the right feel. And I think it -- a lot of people just felt like, again, on this issue, do we have any comedy? Can we at least have a conversation -- can we have a moment of grace after his not very good performance at that third debate. I just -- I just thought it was sad for the country in some ways.WOODWARD: But -- but isn't that his brand, going over the line. And he has a tin ear for something like this. And, you know, people look at this, but what about his supporters. I think that's what they expect.WALLACE:  Well, I want to --WILLIAMS: Well, actually --WALLACE:  And I want to bring you in. We've got about a minute left. I mean, are we going to pay a price for the ugliness of this campaign after the election?STRASSEL: I think so because -- we were just talking about a mandate. OK, you know, when Bush ran, it was very clear, if he won, he was going to put his tax policy in and, you know, this was his main thing he was going to do. Can anyone tell me what the number one priority of either of these candidates would be if they were actually elected to the White House? It has been so ugly on both sides, no one's going to come in with a mandate. We're going to have a more divided country than we have ever had before and --WILLIAMS: Actually, (INAUDIBLE).ROVE: If she -- if she gets elected, her unfavorables today are 53 percent. In October of 1964, Barry Goldwater's were 47. And in October of 1972, George McGovern's were 41. She will be the most unpopular person ever to take the office (ph).WILLIAMS: All right --WALLACE:  We got to -- we -- we -- we got to leave it there. You know what --WILLIAMS: All right.WALLACE:  We'll have more time to discuss this in the future. Always leave them wanting more.Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.Up next, Tom Hanks and the folks on ""Saturday Night Live"" poke fun at, well, all the participants in the final debate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TOM HANKS, ACTOR: Tonight is going to be a lot like the third ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. You don't really want to watch, but, hey, you've come this far.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANKS: WikiLeaks has been releasing your campaign e-mails, many of which raise some serious questions.KATE MCKINNON, ACTOR, ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"": Thank you for bringing up my e-mails, Chris. And I'm -- I'm very happy to clarify what was in some of them. Sorry, what, Carol? What? I'm sorry, I thought I heard my friend Carol. Anyway, back to your questions about the way that Donald treats women. And that is how you pivot.HANKS: So you're just never going to answer a question about your e-mails?MCKINNON: No, but it was very cute to watch you try.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  That was ""Saturday Night Live's"" take on this week's debate.And what a week it was as the candidates faced off for the final time and then started their sprint to the finish on the trail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.CLINTON: There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.TRUMP: Should have gotten it.CLINTON: This -- this is a mindset.No more debates. No more naps.IVANKA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER: He is -- he is not politically correct. And -- and I think we love that about him, right? Ninety-seven percent of the time.TRUMP: And I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election -- if I win.SEN. TIM KAINE, D-VA., VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  And, no, Donald, you've got to accept the results win or lose.JOE BIDEN, D-VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I remember dating a guy from -- oh, dating, God. By the way, the reason guys can date is because of me.KAINE: This is the weirdest race I've ever seen, and I'm in the middle of it.GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Did you want to make take a picture? I'd be happy to --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Sure.PENCE: Just in case we turn out to be somebody important, so --TRUMP: This is the first time ever, ever, that Hillary is sitting down and speaking to major corporate leaders and not getting paid for it.CLINTON: You notice there is no teleprompter here tonight, which is probably smart. They're hard to keep up, and I'm sure it's even harder when you're translating from the original Russian.BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You -- you used to criticize me for even talking to the Russians. Now suddenly you're OK with your nominee having a bromance with Putin.(INAUDIBLE)KAINE: Do this. Wait. Do this.TRUMP: What a waste of time if we don't pull this off. You know, these guys have said, doesn't matter if you win or lose, there's never been a movement like this in the history of this country. I say, it matters to me whether we win or lose.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  You can be sure the narrative will change again in these final 16 days before the election.And that's it for today.
