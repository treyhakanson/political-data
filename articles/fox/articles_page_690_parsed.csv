This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" October 24, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And this is a Fox News Alert.  A bombshell new report by The National Enquirer details how Bill and Hillary Clinton allegedly utilized the services of a political fixer for over a decade.  It's a story you'll hear only tonight on ""Hannity.""Also tonight, you'll hear from Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway.But first, The National Enquirer, after a 16-month investigation, describes how the man they call Mr. Fixit helped the Clintons cover up their various scandals. Now, according to The Enquirer, this man's story is particularly compelling because the magazine alleges that back in 1994, it agreed to drop a story about Bill Clinton in exchange for special access to Roger Clinton's wedding featuring his then pregnant girlfriend, a deal offered to them by Mr. Fixit himself.Now, the National Enquirer issued the following statement regarding their report, writing, quote, ""In vetting this story during almost two years of investigation, we were confident in the credibility of Jeff Rovin after reviewing his handwritten diaries during the relevant time period, fax memos to the White House bearing date and timestamps, payoff ledgers and the independent verification of four other sources who confirm Mr. Rovin's involvement in the Clinton operation.""Now, we did reach out to Hillary Clinton, her campaign and former president Bill Clinton's office multiple times, and neither, shockingly, provided us with a statement. It is important to note that FOX News cannot independently verify the story, but tonight for the first time ever, this man's identity is being revealed.Joining us now in a ""Hannity"" exclusive is novelist and reported former Clinton fixer Jeff Rovin. Mr. Rovin, how are you, sir?JEFF ROVIN, NOVELIST, REPORTED FORMER CLINTON FIXER: Sean (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: Very nice to meet you. How did you meet the Clintons?ROVIN: I've been interviewing celebrities since I was 19. And the editor of The Enquirer at the time, David Perel, good friend of mine, said, Hey, I've got a really bad story about somebody you just profiled in Ladies Home Journal. I said, If I can get you an interview, would you bury it?  Negotiations followed, but that began a decades-long career as what Dylan Howard, the current editor, has...HANNITY: Yes. Now, I did talk to Dylan about your piece. And I'll get to that in a second. You know, a lot of people -- they hear National Enquirer. Let me just put up a few stories that The National Enquirer broke that were correct.For example, The National Enquirer broke first and correctly O.J. in the Bruno Magli shoes, if you remember back at the time. The National Enquirer first broke John Edwards, the whole love child scandal, first the girlfriend, then the picture of the baby, if you recall.The story they broke also was Jesse Jackson's love child, the story that The National Enquirer broke first and correctly, world exclusive, woman at the center of Tiger Woods cheating scandal is exposed. And then the story they broke first and correctly, ""Gary Hart asked me to marry him"" at the time, and they were the first to have photos of Hart and Donna Rice on Monkey Business. And they -- they've gone after conservatives. They went after Rush and some other stories.So people attack it because it's a tabloid, but they have a pretty good track record.ROVIN: David Perel, who ran the teams investigating most of those stories, is a journalist's journalist. You may not like the material, but ironically, it is so heavily vetted, because it is so controversial, it's probably better vetted than most of the stories in other media.HANNITY: Well, I went through with your editor everything that you had.  You do have ledgers. You did have the faxes with the letterhead and the timestamps. The Clintons know you. They're watching now. They know who you are. They know you fixed things for them.Tell us about how you got in the business with them and what you did.ROVIN: I was fixing something -- I really don't like that term, but there it is. I was fixing something for an actor who was in their inner circle, and that was how I was engaged. Now, it was that simple. I also as a ghost writer for Tom Clancy had met generals and undersecretaries. I knew where the back doors were in Washington. So there were different way to deal with things.HANNITY: You knew when Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton went on ""60 Minutes and they denied Gennifer Flowers, which eventually he admitted in the Starr report that he was lying.ROVIN: Yes. You know, I thought this was going to be pretty easy when I first agreed to do it because you had Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers. This stuff was out there. I figured, OK, we're done. We weren't.I would say that David Perel's files -- and I know that Dylan and his team have their own files, but David's files were massive. I mean, we're talking Canterbury Tales massive. And the reason that I agreed to participate in this process now was not an easy decision because I don't like...HANNITY: Why did you?ROVIN: Because Dylan showed me the article. There were names in there that I didn't feel should be in there, friends of mine, confidential sources that he didn't realize were confidential. And I said to him, OK, I will participate provided I can compare your article to my journals, take out these names. And most importantly -- and this is going to have the odor of hypocrisy considering the story itself -- I wanted to write an editorial condemning the salacious nature of political reporting now.Look, the New York Times has become The Enquirer, The Enquirer has become The New York Times. The world is upside down. We've got to set it right again.HANNITY: All right, so your job was to help hide their scandals. And the degree to which -- you're saying they had an open marriage. You're talking about hookers. You're talking about dirty tricks, buying off journalists and much more. Why don't you give us specifics.ROVIN: Well, again, let me qualify that by saying these are Dylan's words.  One of the reasons I wanted to come on your show...HANNITY: Is there anything that's not true, what I said?ROVIN: No, no, no. No. One of the reasons I wanted to come on your show is to put things in a little less hyperbolic way perhaps.HANNITY: A little less sensational?ROVIN: Yes, without the screaming...HANNITY: You don't think paying off people and having an open marriage and...ROVIN: To me, it's not my business and it's nobody else's business.HANNITY: So you're libertarian in terms of people's sexuality. That doesn't matter to you?ROVIN: My personal feelings were irrelevant in this. It was really a matter of -- look, when you are at the White House and turn a corner and there's the Gilbert Stewart portrait of George Washington that's on our money, when you walk in the Rose Garden with your wife, you get seduced.  You want to protect the people who are helping you have that access.HANNITY: And that happened to you?ROVIN: To a degree, sure. And I was only on the periphery. You can imagine what...HANNITY: How many times were you in the Clinton White House?ROVIN: Twice. I was there twice.HANNITY: OK. What about -- one of the big issues that I think matters -- Hillary claims she's a champion of women's rights. You have -- I assume this came from you, to Harold Ickes, a lot of redactions in it, though, about how to smear Monica Lewinsky.ROVIN: Actually, that particular document came the other way around. It was...HANNITY: It was...ROVIN: It was...HANNITY: It says to Mr. Ickes from...ROVIN: Yes, the from was one of the reporters that we hired to dig into Monica's story. And that document...HANNITY: And they were out to smear her in a major way, to be nuts, and you know, very unstable, emotionally needy, you know, all sorts of dirt.ROVIN: But here's the irony of this. That document has been in the files of the tabloids for 20 years because I was told, Send this to your contacts, see if they can dig up more information. And I'm only glad that I got to apologize in person to Monica.HANNITY: You did?ROVIN: Yes, I did.HANNITY: Where?ROVIN: She became my neighbor in New York in one of those cosmic karmic ironies.HANNITY: Well -- and you told her what you did and who paid you.ROVIN: Well...HANNITY: You said you never got paid. Did you? You never got paid?ROVIN: I never got paid for this, no.HANNITY: Why would you be a fixer and not get paid?ROVIN: Because I was working with people who...HANNITY: But you got money to pay off other people.ROVIN: Correct.HANNITY: And who gave you that money?ROVIN: Not going to get into that. Those are some of the names that I wanted out of the original article.HANNITY: So there were certain people that would give you money. Was there ever threats if you either knock it off or we'll break your legs?ROVIN: No. It was-HANNITY: Not necessarily from you. I watch a lot of movies.ROVIN: Yes.HANNITY: Yes.ROVIN: Well, I mean...HANNITY: Or was it all bribery.ROVIN: It was all bribery, but it was more...HANNITY: Payoffs.ROVIN: Yes because...HANNITY: And was there a -- was there a sort of a threat, a subtle threat given, You're going to shut up now. Anything like...ROVIN: Well...HANNITY: Well, that's a fair question.ROVIN: No, it's absolutely a fair question. But the trickle down or trickle up nature of this was the tabloid sources that I would pay would then go to their sources, who were invisible people like limo drivers, hotel clerks, wait staff, security guards who would see and hear things and would tip them off.So it went from that group to the reporters through me. And then I had to make a decision about how to deal with it. And most of the time, it was just money. There never had to be any threats.HANNITY: What was your contact -- you're saying the Clintons directly knew what you were doing.ROVIN: I spoke to Hillary on two separate occasions about certain things.  Now...HANNITY: Can you say what they are?ROVIN: I'd rather not at this point. This...HANNITY: This is a big part of the question, though. This would be important.ROVIN: I spoke to her at the Roger Clinton wedding.HANNITY: Where The National Enquirer had exclusive access.ROVIN: Yes.HANNITY: Maureen Dowd said it's not true.ROVIN: Yes. Well, we had exclusive complete access. I saw Maureen had filed a story in The New York Times.HANNITY: Right.ROVIN: You have to remember that every time I saw Hillary, I was bringing bad news. The messenger got shot.HANNITY: Did she have the infamous temper we read about? Not with you?ROVIN: I wouldn't say there was a temper. There was a steeliness. There was a...HANNITY: A resolve to fix it.ROVIN: Yes. You're...HANNITY: Would she tell you specifically, You fix this?ROVIN: She said she wanted it fixed.HANNITY: I tell you what. We got to take a break. We'll come back, and we'll have more. This is a pretty incredible story about coverups and -- well, about a life of the Clintons that they obviously don't want the American people to know. We'll continue with Jeff Rovin. He is known as the fixer. This is a National Enquire piece.And also coming up tonight, Project Veritas released a brand-new video of Democratic operatives appearing to admit that Hillary Clinton ordered a dirty politics plan to try and damage Donald Trump. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, is here tonight.And then later, Donald Trump's running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence is here. That and more straight ahead right here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity"" as we continue with novelist and reported former Clinton fixer Jeff Rovin is with us.All right, smearing happened, money was paid, orders were given. You were to go out and damage the reputation of people like Monica Lewinsky.ROVIN: Well, I didn't personally go out and damage it, but...HANNITY: Part of an effort.ROVIN: It was a team effort, yes.HANNITY: Got it. This was an open marriage with the Clintons.ROVIN: So it's been said.HANNITY: Well, wait a minute. That's hedging way too much here. That's what the piece says.ROVIN: Look, if screaming is to be taken as validation, there were -- there were harsh words behind closed doors that we all heard.HANNITY: And their effort was to destroy Monica Lewinsky -- destroy her.ROVIN: That was the original concept. And I have to say, as this proceeded -- because the president kept insisting there was nothing there.  And ultimately -- and again, this may sound strange, to his credit, he's the one who put the kibosh on using any of this material.HANNITY: You also claim that, in fact, Hillary did, in fact, have a romantic relationship with Vince Foster.ROVIN: That -- you know, that was pretty much of an open secret where -- in our circles. And you know, the order to intervene with the press for at least a half hour after he committed suicide...HANNITY: Will you let the media look at these ledgers, the 24 years' worth, I guess, that you handed over to Dylan, the year's worth of notes and calendars, in this 10-year period, will you let the public, will you let journalists see that?ROVIN: I'd have to think about that. Certainly...HANNITY: The things that Dylan saw that put this piece together.ROVIN: Yeah. It required me to be there to interpret a lot of, you know, my shorthand.HANNITY: Sure.ROVIN: But the fact that my dates lined up with his dates and his information was what was important.HANNITY: It is interesting because one of the worries of the Clinton campaign -- and we saw this from Wikileaks and John Podesta, and in particular, his relationship with this woman that the Secret Service has labeled ""the energizer."" And the subject line read, Julie, which is her real name, and saw her picture in The Enquirer, Podesta wrote to Cheryl Mills, obtained by Wikileaks, probably need to revisit the White Haven conversation -- that seems to corroborate.ROVIN: Well, but that's just my point. The Enquirer has its own independent resources. And again, I have to stress I came forward primarily to protect the people that I worked with.HANNITY: What is this tape that The Enquirer had that you came in and got, and you traded off special access to Roger's wedding? What is that?ROVIN: I was alerted to the fact that there was an audiotape from an answering machine involving -- in which the president's name was invoked, a liaison with a young woman was recommended or suggested, I forget which.  And as soon as we found out about that, we wanted it to be killed.It had been offered to The Enquirer. I called David Perel, and he said, Well, if you've got something more newsworthy, we'll consider it. I went back to my people with that, and we decided the wedding was probably more newsworthy.HANNITY: How many reporters were paid off to kill stories for the Clintons, that you know of?ROVIN: Again, they were paid to soften the stories.HANNITY: Or kill it.ROVIN: They eventually got out in diluted form. But we had, I think, five primary tabloid reporters, The Enquirer, The Star and The Globe, who were watching out for everything that went on editorially and...HANNITY: Could anyone pay to get a story killed?ROVIN: Pay...HANNITY: Could you pay to get a story -- they're writing a story about you. Could you go to them and say, I'll give you X dollars to kill the story?ROVIN: We'll find out tomorrow, but I don't think so.HANNITY: You don't think -- but how -- are these prominent? Is this The New York Times, ABC, CBS?ROVIN: No, no, no, no, no.HANNITY: These are tabloid reporters.ROVIN: What would happen is if we got wind of a story from the tabloids, chances were pretty good it would end up in one of the mainstream newspapers or magazines. We would then contact one of those people and say, This isn't true, don't run it. Here's...HANNITY: All right, final two questions. What do you want people to take out of this? What do you -- in other words, you say you're a libertarian.  You don't care about people's private life. OK, this is pretty salacious stuff.ROVIN: Yes.HANNITY: What do you want people to take out of that?ROVIN: It's a stinking business. It's an absolutely rotten stinking business.HANNITY: The Clintons stink because they hire people like you to kill stories for them, or are they smart?ROVIN: It's absolutely necessary, unfortunately, and...HANNITY: For them.ROVIN: For everyone. I mean, if you've seen ""Weiner,"" you know what I'm talking about.HANNITY: Right.ROVIN: It's -- the main appeal of this to me and the risks that I am taking professionally to do this -- I don't know what's going to happen to the TV series based on my novels. They could die tomorrow.HANNITY: Right.ROVIN: The important message to get out, and you've said it yourself, is the election is too important to focus on this salacious material.HANNITY: That raises my last question. Who are you voting for? Because obviously, people are going to wonder. Are you doing this because you like Donald Trump?ROVIN: I am not doing this for or against any candidate. I'm doing this, hopefully, to...HANNITY: Level the playing field?ROVIN: Level it and I -- I hope that this stuff is so unpalatable that we just stop. I mean, I know that's an absurd dream.HANNITY: It sounds like you like Trump, though.ROVIN: I like Trump, sure.HANNITY: Who are you voting for?ROVIN: One of those two.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: All right. Thank you for being with us.ROVIN: Thanks, Sean.HANNITY: Appreciate it.Coming up next, Project Veritas out with a brand-new undercover video that appears to show Hillary Clinton, in fact, is at the center of this sinister plot to try and damage Donald Trump. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, is here with reaction.And also later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We're going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump this weekend unveils his contract with you, the American voter, during a major speech over the weekend in Gettysburg.  Trump's running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence is here. He'll join us as ""Hannity"" continues tonight on this busy news night.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So Project Veritas is out with a brand-new undercover video tonight that appears to show Democratic operatives admitting that Hillary Clinton herself is responsible for a dirty politics plan to try to attack Donald Trump over his tax returns.  Now, FOX News, as we've been telling you -- we have not independently verified what's seen in the video, but it is beyond shocking.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Originally, we were going to (INAUDIBLE) we were going to do Uncle Sam. I want you to give us your tax returns.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's been done, yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) It's much easier (INAUDIBLE) The guy who's done this other Chicken George thing has this other idea, and in the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground. So by God, we will get the ducks on the ground.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So it's -- wow!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't repeat that to anybody.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: We reached out to all the people and groups that were referenced in the video. We didn't hear back.Now, also tonight, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that a super-PAC for major Clinton ally Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe donated -- get this -- almost a half a million dollars to the state senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe. Now, he's the FBI's deputy director. He's the guy that oversaw the investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail server. You can't make this up.Here with reaction is Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway.  All right, we established in the earlier Project Veritas videos that the money goes from the campaign to the DNC to this Democratic group to those people fomenting violence and planning widespread -- you know, plotting, planning and scheming widespread voter fraud in this election cycle.Now in this third tape, it goes directly to Hillary herself making the decision about how this outside group, these agitators -- exactly what they're to do. Now, I'd like to know what did she know, when did she know it? Did she know about the fomenting of violence? Did she know about the scheme for major voter fraud? Are these fair questions?KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: They're very fair questions, Sean. And there's a pattern of conduct here that is destroy your opponent.  I heard nothing in these tapes at all about how Hillary Clinton is going to explain ""Obama care"" 3.0 in all of its merits, how she'll defeat terrorism, how she'll get the 94 millions people out of the workforce into the workforce, help these millions of men and women and children who are in poverty and not insured.It's never that way. It's always the cesspool of the politics of personal destruction. And if you don't hear it in a Project Veritas and see it in a Project Veritas videotapes, then just go to a swing state with me sometime, friend, and go turn on a TV because it's all over America, attack, attack, attack.You know, we're old enough to remember last month, Hillary Clinton saying, When they go low, we'll go high. That lasted a hot minute. And they've been going low ever since, and these tapes just prove it.HANNITY: What do you make...CONWAY: (INAUDIBLE) I just want to mention is...HANNITY: Go ahead.CONWAY: I just want to mention very quickly that Donald Trump is out there talking about the rigged corrupt system. And when he talks about the rigged corrupt system, he's really talking about the forgotten man and forgotten woman.And these tapes, these revelations, show exactly what he means, Sean, that the rigged corrupt system means that the little guy gets left behind, that somebody like Donald Trump, who the mainstream media and the moneyed folks and the entire political left don't want to be a legitimate candidate, don't want to win -- they will stop at nothing to try to destroy him. They don't want to debate on the issues. They just want to destroy him.And when he talks about the rigged corrupt system, people see -- I think -- I think it's a very resonant message because people see right in front of them that everything's unfair.HANNITY: For Donald Trump to win, he must win Florida. He must win North Carolina. He must win Ohio. And that's assuming that Utah, Texas and Georgia is not in play, as some are suggesting, which I don't believe they are. Then he's got to win New Hampshire. he's got to win Iowa or New Mexico instead of New Hampshire, and then he's got to take Nevada. He's got to take Arizona. For him it's got to be, he's got to run the table...CONWAY: You're one short.HANNITY: Which one?CONWAY: Well, then you need Maine 2.HANNITY: Maine congressional 2. I'm not -- I can't forget that. You're right. That one...CONWAY: That's right...HANNITY: That's key to 270. So you're right. What I mentioned is 269.CONWAY: Otherwise, it's 269...HANNITY: Right. I know.CONWAY: and then it's Speaker Paul Ryan (INAUDIBLE) Speaker Paul Ryan decides, I think, who the president will be.HANNITY: Yes, he'd pick Hillary. He'd probably pick Hillary.CONWAY: No, he would not.HANNITY: Oh, really?CONWAY: He would pick Mr. Trump and Governor Pence. Yes, Sean, he would.CONWAY: I'll believe it when I see it.CONWAY: But here's the thing. We're not taking our chances. So you've laid out the map, and then we've got a couple of other states we're being competitive in there. Watch where we deploy our assets, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, where we're up in paid advertising and where we're also trying to leverage some other opportunities.HANNITY: All right...CONWAY: But look, every time somebody tries to apply conventional principles to Donald Trump, they're wrong because this is a guy who's defied convention from day one. And I believe the people are making up their own minds. They won't be told -- just as in the primaries, they won't be told who can win, how to think, who to vote for, what to believe, the race is over.The race is not over! Give people their voice and their vote. It is not up to you or me and anybody in Clinton world, it's certainly not the mainstream media...HANNITY: I agree. It's up to the voters.ROVIN: (INAUDIBLE) Republican is to cover the election, not tilt it. It's up to the voters. They deserve to stand in line and express their vote.  And I'm telling you the people who stand in line for a Trump rally, 10,000, 15,000 strong...HANNITY: They're going to vote.CONWAY: ... they are coming out to vote.CONWAY: Yes, and the 400 that show up at Hillary's rally, I assume they'll vote, too. All right, Kellyanne. Good to see you.CONWAY: That's like a professor's lecture. It's not a rally!HANNITY: Yes, I know.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: All right. And coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity,"" Indiana governor Mike Pence joins us.And also later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Without the media, Hillary Clinton would be nothing! They're disgraceful!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump -- he takes on the liberal press after evidence of collusion between the media and the Clinton campaign appears. We're going to show you the latest example from Wikileaks.That and more tonight on this busy news night right here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" We're only 15 days away from Election Day, and this past Saturday in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump laid out what he will do in his first 100 days in office and his contract with you, the American voter. Here are some of the highlights.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: What follows is my 100-day action plan to make America great again. A constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.TRUMP: A requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated.We will cancel all federal funding of sanctuary cities.We will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country. These are drug dealers, gang heads, gang members, killers.We're going to suspend immigration from terror prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with health savings accounts.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right. Joining us now, Donald Trump's running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence is with us. Governor, good to see you. But this actually goes deeper than just 10 things. This is really about 28 specific promises. And I wanted to give you an opportunity to outline it for people, because, you know what, we do talk a lot about non-substantive issues, and I figured this is a good opportunity to talk about how are we going to get this country moving again economically, foreign policy, protect the homeland.MIKE PENCE, R-VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, Sean, and I appreciate the opportunity. I think what Donald Trump laid out in Gettysburg is really what the election is all about. It's a choice between two futures.Never in my lifetime have I seen a more dramatic choice between the policies of Hillary Clinton who wants to raise taxes, have open borders, continue the kind of trade deals that are costing jobs, hollow out our military, walk away from the high ideals of the American people enshrined in the constitution.And Donald Trump, who you heard lay out that plan in a way he's been laying out now for months, a plan to really make America great again by rebuilding the military, ending illegal immigration, cutting taxes, repeal Obamacare, having the kind of trade deals that support jobs, and having appointments to the Supreme Court of the United States that will uphold those constitutional ideals. Those are the big issues, that's the big choice.But I have to tell you. At rallies here in North Carolina today, the enthusiasm for this agenda, the enthusiasm for Donald Trump's vision to make America great again I think is driving us toward a great, great day on November 8th.HANNITY: For a Republican to win, if we look at historically, you have to thread the needle. You have to win North Carolina, must win. You've got to win Florida. You've got to win Ohio. You've got to win Iowa, hopefully New Hampshire and New Mexico. And hopefully then put other states in play.As you look at the electoral map and you look at the poll numbers, it has you close in a lot of the swing states, but down in some of them. How do you interpret that? Do you think there's a Brexit effect? Do you think there are people that won't admit to voting for Donald Trump, or do you believe the polls?PENCE: The only poll that matters is going to be finished on November 8th, that's first. But there's a couple of national polls, Rasmussen and ""Investors Business Daily"" that actually have use leading. IN North Carolina just today Fox reported that we're only down one here in North Carolina.But I've got to tell you, you know, Abraham Lincoln said memorably believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see. What I'm seeing on the ground here in North Carolina, what Donald Trump and I saw in Cleveland on Saturday night, him in Naples today, in Florida today, there's an enthusiasm on the ground like I've never seen in my lifetime. People are coming out, some of whom have been --HANNITY: How do you feel about the early poll numbers?PENCE: -- disappointed in politics for years.HANNITY: I got a chance to see early numbers in Iowa, in Ohio, in Florida.  Dems are down almost about half of where they were at this point in the campaign early voting in 2012. How do you interpret that? Do you think that's a sign? Do you know the crowds are a sign? Do you think that translates into an enthusiasm your campaign has, Hillary's small crowd shows a lack of enthusiasm?PENCE: We're watching that. And, you know, you're seeing some evidence in the state of Ohio, the counties that Barack Obama won are significantly down, counties that Mitt Romney won are about where they were four years ago.I have to tell you, the biggest evidence to me, I was in Circleville, Ohio, on Saturday. My family and I were campaigning at the pumpkin show. You would have loved it. There were probably 20,000 people in the streets of Circleville. We had to get out of the vehicles because so many people were cheering us on.They handed me a microphone. I said I was going to see the next president of the United States in Cleveland that night, and literally 20,000 people cheered. And this was just a wide open public festival. I mean, there is an enthusiasm from everyday Americans, from people from every walk of life who just know we can be stronger again and know we can be more prosperous again.And that 100-day agenda that you started out our conversation with I think gives people a place to go. And hopefully it also gives Republican as place to go who aren't quite there with us yet. I said today in North Carolina several times, it's time for Republican to come home. We've got support from independents and from many Democrats, but, as you said many times, Sean, it's time for the Republicans to come home and come together.  Elect Donald Trump, reelect Republican majorities in the House and Senate and turn this country around.HANNITY: There's no excuse. They'll get the Hillary Clinton they deserve if they don't see just on that one issue or vetting refugees or cutting taxes and lowering the corporate tax rate and energy independence and eliminating Obamacare. If they can't see the differences at this point, they're a lost cause.Let me ask you. Donald Trump has taken a lot of heat over talking about a rigged election. I would argue the Republican establishment, even friends of yours like Paul Ryan, have been against him. I would argue that the Democratic establishment is against him. We now know through WikiLeaks that the media is colluding with Hillary. But they're acting as if this is the first time it's ever been said. let me play Barack Obama in 08.  Listen to this(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would just like to know what you can say to reassure us that the election will not be rigged or stolen.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: Well, I tell you what, it helps in Ohio that we've got Democrats in charge of the machines. I come from Chicago. So I want to be honest.  It's not as if it's just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past. Sometimes Democrats have too. You know, whenever people are in power, you know, they have this tendency to try to, you know, tilt things in their direction.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: So Democrats have talked about rigged elections too, and he is basically admitting to it.PENCE: I got to tell you, I saw on Twitter the other day a montage of sound bites of Obama and Clinton all of them using the term ""rigged.""HANNITY: That was probably my show. But go ahead.(LAUGHTER)PENCE: It probably was. It probably was.But what Donald Trump is saying, certainly voter fraud is real in polling places in pockets around the country. And in the next 15 days people ought to be willing to respectfully participate in the process to ensure the integrity of the vote.But when Donald Trump says ""rigged system,"" it's just as much being rigged by a media that's trying to write stories in the last 48 hours to suggest this election is over. The collusion that now we see in these e-mails where you have reporters checking with Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman whether or not the article they wrote was good, or -- I mean, this is the kind of rigged system that's been benefitting the favored few liberal political class in Washington, D.C. The American people are on to it.And I think it's the center of Donald Trump's appeal. They know that when he becomes president of the United States he's going to get up every day and fight for the American people. His only special interest will be them.  And I have to tell you, I think that's the reason why you're seeing Republicans, Democrats, and independents rallying around the cause here in North Carolina, and I see that momentum every day.HANNITY: All right, governor, we have 15 days to go, pretty soon 14 in less than two hours. Good to see you. We'll talk soon. Thank you, sir.PENCE: Thank you.HANNITY: And coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Without the media, Hillary Clinton would be nothing. They're disgraceful.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump taking aim at the liberal mainstream media as new WikiLeaks revelations show even more collusion between the press and the Clinton campaign, that and more straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: These thieves and crooks, the media -- not all of it. Not all of it, but much of it.(BOOS)TRUMP: They're the most crooked. They're almost as crooked as Hillary.  They may even be more crooked than Hillary, because without the media she would be nothing. Without the media Hillary Clinton would be nothing.  They're disgraceful.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And they are disgraceful. Donald Trump earlier today attacking the mainstream media for the blatant collusion with the Clinton campaign.  Now, a lot of this has been uncovered by the WikiLeaks e-mail dump. Some examples of this collusion include Reuters offering to share House Benghazi intel with the campaign, CNBC's John Harwood, not only did he try and have lunch with Podesta, he advised the Clinton campaign and bragged how he got Donald Trump mad at the one debate that he moderated. We also of course, we have Katie Couric offering to, quote, ""showcase Clinton's personality"" in a potential interview with the Clintons, and ""Politico"" reporter offering the campaign the chance to edit a story, the ""New York Times"" allowing, quote, ""edits,"" the ""Boston Globe"" pumping up the campaign, Univision pressuring the campaign to attack Trump, MSNBC producer praising the Clinton campaign, bragging about their media support. We know about Donna Brazile leaking a town hall question to the campaign.Here with a question are Trump campaign national finance member, author of this brand new book, by the way, it's right there as you can see, our good friend Anthony Scaramucci is with us, ""Hopping Over the Rabbit Hole.""ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, AUTHOR, ""HOPPING OVER THE RABBIT HOLE"": I think Bo is the rabbit. I happen to be the hole.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Democratic, Democratic mayoral candidate Bo Dietl, and nationally syndicated radio talk show host Larry Elder. You're really running for mayor?BO DIETL, FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE: Let me tell you something. Yes. I am filed candidate for mayor against ""Big Bird"" de Blasio. I am outraged.HANNITY: Comrade Bill de Blasio.DIETL: I am outrage about the New York times did. And just the New York Times is supposed to be a paper of record that I respect. Every time I send them a communication, I don't hear nothing back. I wonder why. Now all of a sudden I was looking at these WikiLeaks here, and the communication director Jennifer Palmieri for Hillary Clinton, all of a sudden she gives a call to Mark Labavachik (ph), whatever his name is, all of a sudden, she tells him --HANNITY: Labavachik (ph)?  DIETL: Yes, whatever his name is. Now all of a sudden they're communicating with each other.HANNITY: You're right, it's collusion. And you can veto anything out of the story you want. I thought the New York Times is the paper of record.  When I read it, a paper is supposed to be nonpartisan. Now, all of a sudden they've got this, they've got this Politico. This is wrong.HANNITY: It's wrong. It's collusion.DIETL: You know, I gave money to Donald Trump. I support Donald Trump as president.  HANNITY: Even as a Democrat?DIETL: As a Democrat. But whoever wins I'm going to support the president of the United States. But this to me is an outrage, and these papers, these nonpartisan papers are taking -- letting them look at the story before it's release.  HANNITY: They've interviewed me three times in the last month. I've got no edit capabilities.SCARAMUCCI: They rake me over the coals. He could be the only democrat I raise money for, though, Sean. This is our guy.DIETL: By the way, Democrats --HANNITY: By the way, congrats on the book. ""How entrepreneurs turn failure into success."" I learned a lot. We've been friends for a long time, but I learned a lot about you. You struggled and you're your problems in life.SCARAMUCCI: I try to tell a real story in there. You know, I've been fired. I failed a bar exam. I had ups and downs in the early part of my career. And 2008 was a brutal year for us. Bo was there. Bo helped me get the conference started. He was one of the first keynote speakers.DIETL: He's one of the most resilient guys I have ever met.SCARAMUCCI: I wanted to write a story people could relate to, growing up the way you and I did, coming from families like ours.HANNITY: I am glad I washed dishes and cooked and did construction all those years.SCARAMUCCI: I work for my uncle's motorcycle shop. My dad had me on the stone dock as a kid. I was at Harvard Law School but shoveling sand on these big barges out on Long Island Sound.DIETL: You know --HANNITY: Hang on, let me bring Larry in. Larry, let's talk about this media. It's like an in-kind campaign contribution. We get criticized, Larry, because we're open and honest. We tell people we have a point of view. This is an editorial. There is no pretense. But these guys act like they're fair and balanced. Here's my main question. How come the ""Politico,"" how come the ""New York Times"" people, how come all these outlets, there is no price to pay for the collusion that's been exposed here. Why?LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYNDICATED HOST: Nobody gets fired.  Nobody gets reprimanded. It's business as usual. And Sean, it's one thing to complain about media bias as we often do. It's another thing to try and determine exactly the effect media bias on how people vote. And a friend of mine named Tim Groseclose wrote a book called ""Left Turn"" that tried to do just that. He teaches at George Mason University. And he found out of the top 20 sources of news, 18 of them are leftwing, only two are not, and that's the nightly news with Bret Baier, and The Washington Times. And his analysis is that if the media were truly fair and balanced, if they really gave another point of view about fill in the blank -- climate change, minimum wage, taxes, Obamacare, illegal immigration, if they really gave people the other point of view, the average state would vote the way Texas does which is about eight to 10 points in favor of the Republicans.HANNITY: And coming up, we need your help. A very-important ""Question of the Day,"" that is straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right, time for our ""Question of the Day."" So what do you think of Donald Trump's contract with you, the American voter? Just go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.Unfortunately, that is all the time we have left this evening. Thanks for being with us.

5	5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/10/22/clinton-defends-record-as-lawmakers-press-for-answers/	Clinton defends record as lawmakers press for answers	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 22, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""You are looking live at Capitol Hill where lawmakers are trying to get the truth from Hillary Clinton on the 2012 attack in Benghazi. The hearing is about to resume after a short recess. The secretary has been testifying all day before the House Select Committee investigating the attack. She and ranking democrat Elijah Cummings have accused the republicans of trying to derail her presidential campaign. But, Trey Gowdy, chairman of the panel, set them straight right out of the gate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TREY GOWDY, R-S.C.: I understand there are people, frankly, in both parties who have suggested that this investigation is about you. Let me assure you, it is not. This investigation is about four people who were killed representing our country on foreign soil. It is about what happened before, during and after the attacks that killed them. It is about what this country owes to those who risk their lives to serve it. There is no statute of limitations on the truth.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Hillary was defiant at times during tense exchange with committee members. She then took a softer tone at one point to convince them she was more concerned about finding answers than they were.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've would imagine, I've thought more about what happened than all of you put together. I've lost more sleep than all of you put together. I have been racking my brain about what more could have been done or should have been done.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. So obviously, she was trying to portray herself as sort of the victim that, ""I have more understanding, more compassion. I am on a much more important quest for the truth than any of you. You just don't want me to be president."" That's what she's trying to convince. Do you think that it worked from a communications standpoint?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: I think for -- I think this is what it is, 44 percent of the American people have already made up their mind about Hillary Clinton before today and they don't like her. And they're not going to vote for her, they've made up their mind, that's settled. The other 44 percent love her, think that this is perfect for her and she solidified that for them. And they will be able to say, she did fine. She answers the questions. Everybody should move on. Obviously, as commanding presence, she was well-briefed, et cetera. You're going to see tomorrow the media will help her, try to put this story behind it. For me, I actually -- I thought that was absolutely inauthentic and unpersuasive what she just said about losing more sleep than anybody else because, I think what she should have said actually to show the compassion she was trying to show, which is to say, the people that have lost the most sleep over this are the victims' families.GUILFOYLE: Sure.PERINO: OK? Let's start there. The main issue for me that is still not resolved is the crux of this hearing and the whole point of the issue about who pushed the video. Because, now we know in the discussions that she sent an e-mail to Chelsea Clinton that night, saying that it was an attack by al-Qaeda. She tells that to the Egyptian prime minister, but in the days that follow, she actually uses the video as an excuse. But then in today's hearing, she said that she didn't. So to me, that is still unresolved and that was the point of what I wanted to hear today.GUILFOYLE: OK. Well, one key question a lot of Americans want answered. Why did Clinton and others in the administration, initially blame the attack on protest sparked by a video? We've been asking that on this show. Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan tried to get to the bottom of that by reading several, previously, overlook e-mails that indicated that Clinton knew all along the assault was driven by terrorists.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: You had a conversation with the Egyptian prime minister, he told him this. ""We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest.CLINTON: Look at the statement that I've made. I clearly said that it was an attack.JORDAN: Calling it an attack is like saying the sky is blue. Of course, it was an attack.CLINTON: There was a lot of conflicting information that we were trying to make sense of.JORDAN: Americans can live with the fact that good people sometimes give their lives for this country, but what they can't take, what they can't live with is when their government is not square with them.CLINTON: I wrote a whole chapter about this in my book, Hard Choices. I'd be glad to send it to you, Congressman.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Well, promoting herself.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: You know what? I actually, Kimberly -- as someone who hawks a book.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I have to -- and it's right to say how to be right in every time. I have to give her props for doing that at that point. Look, you know Jim Jordan finally pursued the truth. Who pushed the video and why? And it was the camouflage their incompetence over diplomatic security. She told her family it was a terror attack and told the victims it's a video. Why did she lie? Because she had -- she was trying to save her own skin. Then, she goes into this soliloquy about how -- if you look at other terror attacks, there's never any partisanship afterwards. After the bombing in Lebanon, there was no partisanship at all, we all came together. That's because there was no cover-up after these bombings. There was nobody slamming about the video. One last thing and I'll shut up. The constant reframe from this hearing was that Chris Stevens chose his destiny. When Adam Smith says, ""He chose to go to Benghazi."" It's the political version of saying, ""He shouldn't have gone out, dressed like that.""PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: He should have worn a bra.PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: I mean, he basically saying that he had it coming. Blame the victim by saying that he took the job. The other refrain, and then I'll shut up. I said I shut up before. They keep talking -- first time ever, democrats are talking about saving money.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: They keep saying, ""Oh, $5 million. Well, this hearing cost $5 million. This hearing cost $5 million -- that's a rounding figure on the Viagra. It's a bunch of garbage. They've never cared more about money than now.GUILFOYLE: All right, Bolling, follow that.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: So, as Dana points out, the very night of the attacks. Now remember, these attacks were exactly 10 years to the day of the initial World Trade Center bombings, I mean, hello. So that very night, he e-mails Hillary Clinton, calls out -- looks like an al-Qaeda-type attack. Jim Jordan came with the second one, which, this is -- here's the smoking gun, guys. This is it right here. Clinton e-mails, the prime minister saying, ""We know that the attack in Libya -- we know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: It was a planned attack, not a protest. Now that's the day after the attack, 9-12-11, OK, that day. Three days later, after that, they blame the video on over draped caskets in Andrews Air Force Base. Five days later, Susan Rice goes on the talk shows blames the video. Eleven days or 12, maybe 13 days later President Obama goes to the U.N. and blames the video. The question -- we now know they lied. They formulated this elaborate scheme, but why? Greg asks why. Yes -- obviously, number one reason, because Hillary Clinton was asked for security, she turned it down and four Americans died. That's her end of why. His end of why, President Obama? Well, on 9-12, the same day that Clinton just outs it and let's everyone know it's a terror attack. President Obama flies to Las Vegas for a campaign event to raise money after he makes a speech from the Rose Garden. Both of these two made massive errors and the only way to get out of it was to blame the video and not. GUILFOYLE: To do a cover up.BOLLING: Blame what really happened, which they knew from the very moment.GUILFOYLE: That's the crux of it. That's what they need to be focusing on. There have been questions about security and what was done in advance. It really is about the cover up, it's about who pushed the video that they perpetuated as false narrative to the American people over and over again, but she was OK to tell Chelsea Clinton the truth, but not all the rest of us.BOLLING: And the prime minister.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: You know, this is like, you know, you go out in the woods on a fall weekend with the kids and everything, and you build a campsite and then you tell scary stories inside the tent and every sound sounds like oh, my gosh, the bear is coming. That's what listening to you guys are like.GUTFELD: How so?WILLIAMS: Because -- let me tell you something.GUTFELD: Explain that.WILLIAMS: Because you are so lost in the weeds.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Explain that metaphor.WILLIAMS: 'm going to explain it to you. You are so lost in the weeds and in your own little.GUTFELD: You're on weed.WILLIAMS: You guys are like.GUTFELD: You are smoking weed.WILLIAMS: Talking to each other and yeah, this could be and that could be and it could be the video.GUTFELD: No. It's one question, who pushed the video?WILLIAMS: And it could be the talking point.GUTFELD: How much simple could you get, Juan?WILLIAMS: And you know what? You know what? You know, you could get simple enough to say the tragedy here was the death of these four Americans.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: And we want to find out what happened, what led to it and how we can prevent it.GUTFELD: And why there was a cover-up.WILLIAMS: There's no cover up because you know the truth.GUTFELD: Why -- because you blame it on the video to cover up for the American competence.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. You can talk about politics if you like, and that's been revealed.GUTFELD: It's not politics.WILLIAMS: No, no.GUTFELD: That's morality.WILLIAMS: No, no, that's politics.GUTFELD: That's justice.WILLIAMS: That's politics.GUILFOYLE: Those are the facts.GUTFELD: That's punishment.GUILFOYLE: Those are the facts.WILLIAMS: It's politics long ago disclosed by six previous hearings, plus the accountability commission report, but we are engaged in this because by own republican admission, Kevin McCarthy, Hannah (ph) and all the rest.GUTFELD: It's all politics.WILLIAMS: This -- yeah. And even -- at this table, you guys first say, well you know, if you're for Hillary, then you didn't hear anything. And if you're against Hillary, it didn't change your mind. Gee, I wonder if this is about politics.PERINO: Well, Juan.GUTFELD: That's.PERINO: It doesn't bother you at all, this evidence?WILLIAMS: What evidence?BOLLING: We know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with -- nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: Not a protest and.WILLIAMS: That's what she says.BOLLING: And days, and days after and days after they set the video.WILLIAMS: Right. So she's saying to the ambassador, this is an internal conversation. It's not political, which is a document that came out of state.PERINO: No, but.BOLLING: It's true.GUTFELD: And then she lied to the video.WILLIAMS: Pentagon, the White House, these -- those are political people in the aftermath. That has nothing to do.PERINO: No.WILLIAMS: With the reality of loss of life and the (inaudible).PERINO: Hold on, Juan. Actually, you're making no sense. Can I just try one more time to walk through this?WILLIAMS: Please, please, go right ahead.PERINO: The attacks happened.BOLLING: Immediately.PERINO: Hillary Clinton, that night, this is new information. Sends an e- mail to Chelsea Clinton -- OK, that's a family member.WILLIAMS: Yeah.PERINO: That's OK. And then also, talked to the prime minister of Egypt.WILLIAMS: Yeah.PERINO: And says, ""We know it was not a video that this is a planned attack on our protest.""WILLIAMS: Right.PERINO: And two days later, says in public that it was the video. That doesn't bother you at all?WILLIAMS: It doesn't bother me that politics, when you have the Pentagon.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Oh my, God.WILLIAMS: What?BOLLING: It's a blaming.WILLIAMS: No, no, no, no.BOLLING: Fabrication of why it's.GUILFOYLE: Well he is. He's saying it's OK morally and ethically to lie.WILLIAMS: I'm not saying it's a lie.GUILFOYLE: To lie to these victim's family members.WILLIAMS: Oh my, gosh.GUILFOYLE: To lie to the American people when she knew that it was al- Qaeda.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: It was a terrorist attack.WILLIAMS: I think you guys.GUILFOYLE: Really?WILLIAMS: I think you guys have never dealt in the world of politics, where people spin regularly.GUTFELD: Well we know you.PERINO: Excuse me. That was my job.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Oh yeah.PERINO: And I never.WILLIAMS: I'm telling you.PERINO: Done that.WILLIAMS: Well, I'm telling you, people do it that all the time.GUTFELD: So now you're accusing.PERINO: So that's OK?WILLIAMS: But it's way a far.GUTFELD: Now you're accusing her of politics.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUTFELD: First it was us, but now it's her.WILLIAMS: No. There -- oh you, gee. Do you think there's any politics going on here?GUTFELD: No, what it is, it's covering your ass. That's what she's doing.WILLIAMS: Yeah, fair. But you know what, it wasn't good. GUTFELD: The pantsuit is not enough.WILLIAMS: Look back on the other reports, it was the White House, it was the Pentagon. It was the CIA. It was all of these guys that covering but -- because you know what, there are terrible -- something terrible happened, Greg.GUTFELD: No. You know what happened was, a terror attack happened and it exposed the fact that they had previous warnings that they had ignored. So to cover that up, they had to make it into a spontaneous thing. And that goes back to the one, that one statement. The reason why she said, what difference does it make? That it -- whether it was planned or random, was that erased her culpability because she said, ""If that doesn't matter, then it doesn't matter that I screwed up.""WILLIAMS: How did she screw up? You think that she.GUTFELD: She screwed up.WILLIAMS: She should have -- she ignored.GUTFELD: She's negligent.WILLIAMS: She ignored the warnings about the security you're thinking.GUTFELD: She spends more time -- spending more time exchanging gossip with Sidney Blumenthal than listening to Chris Smith, as she calls him.WILLIAMS: Oh, in other words, when you and I talk...GUTFELD: Same as Chris Stevens.WILLIAMS: When you and I talk, and two pals talking nonsense, oh, we're wasting time?GUILFOYLE: Yeah, she did.WILLIAMS: She can't have a friend in Sidney Blumenthal?BOLLING: Did you, did you listen to.GUTFELD: He's not much of a friend.GUILFOYLE: Oh come on.WILLIAMS: I don't think so -- anyway.BOLLING: Did you listen to the testimony today?WILLIAMS: What?BOLLING: She was asked several times. Why wasn't the security provided for Chris Stevens.WILLIAMS: Yeah, correct.BOLLING: He asked for it. And her answer to that was consistently, he knew what the risks were. She had said 10 times.WILLIAMS: No, I think that she.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I think that she said a hundred times that security people at the State Department, and out in the field, either made decisions that she might not have agreed with, but that it didn't get to her desk directly.PERINO: I think two things.GUILFOYLE: Go ahead.PERINO: One -- from a communications standpoint. I think, actually, they out -- they overcorrected. Internally, they were so worried that the politics of this was going to look bad in the last six weeks, heading into the election.WILLIAMS: Yeah.PERINO: That they decided to find a way. And then the video story got bigger and bigger, and then they try to -- it was like covering up the lie -- that's why they could lie in the first place.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: So I think -- I don't think it actually would have hurt them to have said, ""This is an al-Qaeda attack.GUTFELD: Exactly.PERINO: And say.BOLLING: Right.PERINO: And then to say, why don't we go after the enemy, which is al- Qaeda, the thing that has always bothered me. And I think, Greg, if I remember, on a Saturday morning when I woke up and I could not believe that they had arrested an American.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: For putting out a video that is protected under the First Amendment.GUILFOYLE: How horrible is that.PERINO: You don't -- you always showed your instincts as -- for someone who wants to be president of the United States should be to protect all of our rights to say whatever we want, and not be blamed for inciting a riot.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: Fifty miles away in Egypt -- or Libya.GUILFOYLE: But they let an innocent man to go to jail to cover their political fails and their lies.PERINO: Well, that he was guilty on some other things.GUILFOYLE: But nevertheless.PERINO: But you perp walking in the middle of the night for a parole violation.BOLLING: Because.GUILFOYLE: Because they blame the video.BOLLING: Right.GUILFOYLE: Of the whole attack of this man, right?BOLLING: That they were trying to spin as you're calling it, politics of spin. But also, I think I said eleven, it's 2012.PERINO: Twelve.BOLLING: Also, it's important because what President Obama was selling with a month to an election was.PERINO: We're safe.BOLLING: We're safe. I've kept you safe. I've kept Americans safe. Now four Americans are dead.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, well.PERINO: Right.BOLLING: With a month to go.GUILFOYLE: Does he want to meet the White House?BOLLING: And again, the decision to go to Vegas, I don't care what you say, they would -- 9,000 out of 9,000 times, they would never do that again. That was a big mistake.GUTFELD: Well maybe there was a great buffet. Here's the thing. You know what the thing is?BOLLING: What?GUTFELD: Even if it happened on President Obama's watch as other terrorists attacks, that's not the problem. That's happens when you're president -- these things happen. It happened with Reagan with Lebanon. It happened with Bush with 9/11, it happens here. That's not the problem. The problem is the -- what happens after, the cover-up. The fact that they could not admit that this was a terror attack to the families -- to the victims' families and instead, had to lay this all on this obscure video. That's the problem. The problem -- no one is saying, ""You know, President Obama, it's your fault these four people died."" What people are saying is, ""Why Hillary, did you lie? Why did you lie to save your skin?""WILLIAMS: You know what I think and -- let me just look at it from your perspective, Greg. I think more Americans, according to the polls, want to know more about what happened. But what they want to know about is not the spin, the politics or even what you guys call the lies about, you know, who's going to cover their butts and not get blamed, or Obama running off to have Vegas and -- no, what they want to know is, should in fact we be taking added steps for securing our State Department officials, our ambassadors overseas? Was Hillary Clinton negligent in not looking at those memos, coming, asking for more security? Is it the case that Chris Stevens informed that there was a problem and I need to get out of here and someone wasn't listening in Washington to what one of our men was saying?BOLLING: That's just the e-mail.GUILFOYLE: The answer to all of that is yes.BOLLING: Reference today about that Chris -- Huma Abedin telling Hillary Clinton that Chris Stevens may bail on his ambassadorship because he was worried about what the security issues.PERINO: Yup.WILLIAMS: That's real.BOLLING: She was notified of that.WILLIAMS: OK. Now we're back to something real, but must -- I must say, you guys are much better than those republicans on the committee. I would hire you guys.GUILFOYLE: Oh, nice. Try to recover, Juan.WILLIAMS: No. Recover?GUILFOYLE: We're going to see how the.WILLIAMS: That's a fact. If this is an interesting show, what I thought today was not interesting. And in fact, didn't Shep Smith says he wants, rather watch the Mets.PERINO: Well, it wasn't supposed to be for your entertainment, it's a hearing.WILLIAMS: Oh, oh, oh, that's true.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, it's a fact.WILLIAMS: Oh, I see.GUILFOYLE: It's a fact to finding process.WILLIAMS: Oh yeah.GUILFOYLE: And the victim's families deserve the answers, so do the American people.WILLIAMS: Look like a star-chamber.GUILFOYLE: And now we know who has the close (ph) relationship with the truth and who shouldn't be rewarded for the presidency.BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: You're right.GUILFOYLE: Much more to come on Hilary Clinton's testimony today. Don't move, because The Five, we're coming right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Back now with more on Hillary Clinton's testimony on Benghazi on Capitol Hill today. The House hearing is still underway. Yes, believe it, it's still underway. Earlier, Clinton said she was the one who chose Ambassador Stevens for the dangerous mission in Libya, but then she admitted, she'd didn't keep tabs on his repeated requests for more security.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I was the one who asked Chris to go to Libya as our envoy. I was the one who recommended him to be our ambassador to the president. Those requests and issues related to security were rightly handled by the security professionals in the department. I did not see them. I did not approve them, I did not deny them.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So OK, gee. That was a lot of candor. She's saying, ""I didn't see any of them"" and I guess the follow-up question I would have asked is, don't you think you should have?GUILFOYLE: Yeah. Don't you think it was important enough, since you personally chose and put this man in a very dangerous situation? Certainly, he was willing to serve and we appreciate that. But we also have an obligation to provide adequate safety and security for those people that in that area of conflict, in that region. Why didn't you think it was important enough to follow up and make certain that they were secure?PERINO: Well, I could actually.GUILFOYLE: She's remiss in her job duties.PERINO: I guess -- in a way, Eric, that could be just all of us, sort of Monday-morning quarterbacking. However, what you pointed out in the first block is that e-mail from Huma Abedin, Hillary's aide that says, ""Hey, Madam Secretary, the ambassador, he is thinking of leaving his post because he's worried.GUILFOYLE: She's aware.BOLLING: She's worried about.PERINO: I mean at some point, she -- well, unless she didn't see that e- mail. I mean, she wasn't aware, but it seems strange to me.BOLLING: Very strange. You know what was kind of telling about this, I don't know, six -- what do we do, six hours or so, so far? Hillary Clinton, the democrats -- I can't believe what they're doing. They're not interested in finding facts, they're not interested in seeing if they can find out what went on or to see for the American people to see what went on. What they're trying to do is discredit the committee, discredit the republicans -- most of the attacks are directly at members of the committee and why we're doing this over and over. Meanwhile, we're finding things that are leading to other things. This Jim Jordan hot -- smoking gun e-mail, we now know because of the e-mails from these -- from the servers and what not, which emanated from a prior Benghazi hearing. Hillary Clinton is taken the six hours, so half of its democrats, taken three hours and it's been a three-hour infomercial for her.PERINO: Well she does stamina.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: We have to say. I think that she's showing a little -- she doesn't have ants in her pants. She's not trying to get out of the hearing room. I want to get to one other thing because.GUILFOYLE: That was positive.PERINO: Washington, D.C., everybody so frustrated because no one is ever held to account for anything. And one of the most dramatic moments at the hearing today was when a Congressman Mike Pompeo asked Hillary Clinton, why no one lost their jobs after the deaths of four Americans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, KANSAS CONGRESSMAN: You talk about being disappointed to. I've hear you used that several times. You were disappointed. You (inaudible) be -- why didn't you fire someone?CLINTON: I followed the law, Congressman. That is my.POMPEO: It is the.CLINTON: That was my responsibility.POMPEO: You're telling me that you had no authority to take anyone's paycheck, to have caused anyone to be afraid. You were telling me you were legally prohibited from doing that? Is that your position here this morning?CLINTON: It is my position that in the absence of finding dare election or breach of duty, there could not be immediate action taken.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Thinking about, Greg. Is it fair?GUTFELD: She reminds -- she was like the evil twin of the mom from Everybody Loves Raymond.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: That's what I get from her. I loved it when she said she had -- her job was actually very tough because she had a deal with social media for crying out loud. Like that's her -- that's how tough her job is. And then you have these questions that are choreographed by the democrats. Sanchez, asking this leading questions like, is it safe to say you're awesome? Like, you were fully engaged, weren't you? So it was like I -- you know, that's a good question. Why didn't you fire anybody? Because it's that -- that doesn't help her, to fire people. That's not.BOLLING: And he just said by her own admission, ""I would have to find dereliction of duty to fire someone.""GUTFELD: Look in the mirror.BOLLING: Yeah.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: That's it. We wish you have to fire yourself.GUILFOYLE: Well, she should have started with herself.BOLLING: Yup.GUILFOYLE: It's like fire yourself. That would have been impressive, you know. I mean honestly, especially this is someone who was her friend. I mean with friends like that, who needs enemies. It's like I'm going to stick you, you know, over there in harm's way, and then I'm not going to follow up, despite your requests for added security that has been proved that she knew about and chose to disregard.WILLIAMS: Wait a second. We didn't prove that she.GUILFOYLE: And obviously, that's negligence.WILLIAMS: She did not -- there's no proof that she knew about the need for added security, as you're discussing it, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Are you paying attention to what we're doing here, Juan?WILLIAMS: Yes, I know.GUILFOYLE: OK.WILLIAMS: You're prosecuting Hillary Clinton.GUILFOYLE: Because I feel like I'm wrap up in my Benghazi Groundhog Day.WILLIAMS: Because the republicans in Congress have made a mess of this. And even Eric says that democrats are going after the committee. Gee, I wonder what Trey Gowdy did? I wonder what Richard Hannah had to say. That they were going after Hillary Clinton. And Gowdy, from the first, the first thing he said today was, ""Don't think this is about you, Mrs. Clinton, this is about the loss of life."" And then the whole committee goes after Hillary Clinton.PERINO: But no, but Juan, this has been terrible -- this is the only time she agreed to testify. She chose this date. She wanted to have this hearing.WILLIAMS: I believe she testified back in '13. I believe that she has testified.PERINO: But no, but not --- this is a different committee. This is the Benghazi special committee she agreed to come and testify as she wants it to.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: And I agree that there were politics being played. Especially, in 2012 when they used the video as a cover-up to protect President Obama heading in to those.GUILFOYLE: And protect the White House.WILLIAMS: Oh gee. And you don't think the CIA was trying to make sure that people didn't understand what they were doing. Why they had so many assets on the ground in Benghazi. Oh gee, yes. And was that in America's interest? Yes.GUTFELD: If only Sid Blumenthal was there to help her out.GUILFOYLE: That's the problem.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: He used to be right there by her side.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: We should ask him to come on The Five.GUILFOYLE: Let's bring him here.GUTFELD: Yeah, there'll be grace (ph).PERINO: Oh, I love that.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: All right, we going to take a quick break. We'll return to Clinton's Benghazi testimony ahead, but up next. WikiLeaks, they've done it again. This time, publishing the personal information of CIA Director John Brennan. The agency calls it Crackas. But was it really an active terror? Greg's got that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: The latest WikiLeaks dump features CIA Director John Brennan's address, passport number, his wife's Social Security number, address, phone number, the addresses of his family and in-laws, too. This is heroic stuff, Wiki, bravo. Now terrorists know where someone's granny lives.So who still admires this stuff? The same people who booed the hacking of Sony or their starlets? It's that old hypocrisy: The Hollywood left thinks subversion is cool, unless of course, they're the target.Meanwhile, the media also loves this. Such treasonous appreciation comes from an idiotic view of national security. That the CIA is the real evil and that America has no right to protect itself from those who wish to destroy it. Because after all, we are evil. With that mentality, the end justifies the means. So why not expose a man's most private information?But making the CIA vulnerable puts all of us at risk. So perhaps it's time now to redefine what an ""enemy combatant"" is in the cyber-age. Because WikiLeaks doesn't do this to corrupt countries or jihadists, it's as if they're waging cyber warfare only on us. How odd that those who claim to champion rights to privacy now cheer those who assault it. Perhaps it's time to hack the hackers and the hackers' backers.How do we do that? Well, our leaders and journalists must admit that cyber- attacks are, indeed, attacks, not expressions of freedom. The attack on Brennan was an attack on us, and it wasn't China who did it but the heroes of modern media. May their Social Security numbers run wild.So Eric did WikiLeaks finally...BOLLING: Wait. This is the first time you started with me in two years.GUTFELD: Is that true? Did WikiLeaks -- they damaged their brand. Didn't they -- they were supposed to be all about surveillance, and now they're just like -- the stuff is, like, ridiculous.BOLLING: I don't know. This is pretty nasty stuff.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: Family members, friends. Phone numbers, addresses.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: What's the point? I mean, look, if you want to expose something that you think is going on that's wrong, that's fantastic. I get that. I understand it. But personal information -- what's the upside to that?GUTFELD: No. It's nothing.Kimberly...GUILFOYLE: No, there's nothing redeeming or heroic about it. They're just criminals. There's no purpose to what they're doing whatsoever. Why are you putting someone's Social Security number and his family's information? I mean, wow, you guys are big time. Amazing, good job.GUTFELD: But Dana, they're still seen as heroic among people who write for the Huffington Post.PERINO: But I think that they might -- the shine is off the apple, I think. I don't think that there's much -- there's not much here. And when they sit back and think about it for half a second, the next time WikiLeaks says that they have something, it might not be as enticing.So it's like the little boy who cried wolf.GUTFELD: Interesting.PERINO: It might not be a wolf.GUTFELD: Yes, that's true.PERINO: It might be a little kitten.GUTFELD: But there is a Juan. And where there's a Juan, there's always a way.WILLIAMS: Well, you know what's interesting to me about this story is that supposedly the 13-year-old boy.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: And he's just like a juvenile. Because this act is so adolescent, right?GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: That's why I think that's what we're all saying. There's no point. There's no way you could say, oh, yes, this reveals, as Eric was saying, something about Americans' security or invasion of security.PERINO: Which would be wrong, too.WILLIAMS: Well, but -- I think it's wrong, but remember, even Republicans voted to do away with the Patriot Act in the aftermath of Edward Snowden.Now we have a situation with this kid, he's just being malicious. And he said he's in support of the Palestinians or something, doesn't like American foreign policy. But I think he's just being a numbskull. Especially, the guy's wife? Why would you do that?GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: And what value has it had?GUTFELD: Nothing. Nothing at all.GUILFOYLE: Terrible, awful.BOLLING: Terrible.GUTFELD: Yes, it is. It's an attack. An attack.WILLIAMS: But a 13-year-old did it. How did he do did?PERINO: And do we know that he's American, the 13-year-old?GUTFELD: I don't know. I should have read the story.PERINO: I should have, too. I was riveted on the hearings.GUTFELD: Yes. Yes. OK. Speaking of, up next we return to the big hearing on Capitol Hill, where Hillary Clinton is answering questions from the House Select Committee on Benghazi. You'll hear from the former secretary of state right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: This is a FOX News alert. Moments ago, despite intelligence reports to the contrary within 24 hours of the attack in Benghazi, Hillary Clinton once again said the video played a role in the death of four Americans that September 2012 night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Several of you have raised the video. And have dismissed the importance of the video. And I think that is unfortunate, because there's no doubt. And as I said earlier, even the person we have now arrested as being one of the ringleaders of the attack on our compound in Benghazi is reputed to have used the video as a way to gather up the attackers that attacked our compound.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Several of us -- let me just repeat your own words one more time, Madame Secretary. Your words: ""We know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film."" Nothing to do with the film. We know it. Dana, what's this all about?PERINO: Well, when she says that there are several of you have brought up this video, and they're skeptical, I have a feeling that she probably has a staffer watching ""The Five""...WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: ... and sending her a little note, like, ""See if you can slip this in and try to clarify this.""GUILFOYLE: Clean it up.PERINO: Right? Because it's actually -- it's the evidence, right, that they have it right here.The other thing that really bothers me about this is that she is saying, well, the video is so important to the one person that they arrested, about 16 months later after this attack.But then Susan Rice, the national security adviser, who coordinates all the communications on the policy for the administration, she is the one who sent out, instead of Hillary on the five Sunday shows, she says quote, ""We -- this attack was due to a spontaneous attack inspired by a video."" No. 1.No. 2, then how in the world is your instinct to arrest the video maker in America? That is not supposed to happen under our First Amendment.BOLLING: Greg, pathological, you stick with the story even though you've blown it?GUTFELD: First, she should apologize to the families for lying. But could I please, please do the exercise that I always do, for her logic to be true? I love doing this.OK. Step one, Abdul is at his laptop, and he's looking for cat videos smoking hookah. He thinks those are funny. And he's on his computer, and suddenly, he finds a video about Mohammed.And now normally, you know, Abdul, he's an honor student.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: He works at a soup kitchen. He wants to be a doctor. But suddenly, he's so angry. He calls up his fellow friends. They're fellow honor students. Someone is a dentist. Maybe another one's a florist. And he goes, ""You know what? I'm angry. Let's go into the street and murder four people.""And then, after they murder these people, they go, ""You know what? Let's go back to our jobs and resume our reasonable lives as good citizens.""That has to happen for her lie to be true. It is patently absurd.BOLLING: And it happened to be on 9/11.GUTFELD: Yes. That's -- the big thing is that all of this happened on 9/11, Juan. How could that be? Coincidence?WILLIAMS: Imagine and, gee, you know what? The video comes out, and there are riots in Egypt.GUTFELD: With signs. With signs.WILLIAMS: Oh, and there are riots in Tunisia and Yemen. So in other words, the video did have some negative impact on us and on these countries, right? OK? And...PERINO: In Egypt? This isn't Egypt.GUILFOYLE: In a different country, cool.WILLIAMS: No, no, no, and I'm saying -- and you just heard...GUILFOYLE: Go ahead.WILLIAMS; And you just heard the secretary say that, in fact, they later learned that one of these guys used it just as you said, Gregory.GUTFELD: A totally trustworthy fellow. Trustworthy parents (ph).WILLIAMS: No, yes, but they found out he used it to bring in other...GUTFELD: He also blamed the video. Something in common.WILLIAMS: Well, this is -- but this is your point, right?PERINO: Juan -- Juan...WILLIAMS: And what you made up...GUTFELD: They're lying. They're lying.WILLIAMS: ... you said, ""Oh, they used the video."" Go ahead.PERINO: I'm just pointing to -- I'm just pointing to his paper one more time. She said on the very night of the attack, in an e-mail to Chelsea Clinton, that they knew it was a planned attack not a protest.WILLIAMS: Yes, but Dana -- Dana, that night what they learned was, you know what? This was planned and plotted. And at that point did not know what she just testified to, which is that one of those guys used the video in getting the others involved, as Gregory laid out.PERINO: How many people have seen the video, 40?GUTFELD: I don't know. In fact, they took the video down like that. But it's true: they were all just well-meaning nice people and their immediate response is to kill four people. That makes total sense, Juan.GUILFOYLE: I mean, you know it's not true, right? You do. You're playing around.WILLIAMS: You know what I know is true? I must say, you guys are doing so much better than those Republicans on the committee. And I think that's why Hillary Clinton is responding to you.PERINO: Because you look -- you look terrible.GUILFOYLE: But we don't have to do anything.WILLIAMS: I'm terrible, and Hillary Clinton's terrible, and I think she's a liar.GUILFOYLE: Those are her words.WILLIAMS: I said she didn't know at that point. What do you want her to do, lie?PERINO: Now she's trying to, like...GUILFOYLE: No. Juan, stop.BOLLING: No, no. Juan, Juan, Juan. This happened before they made up the story about the video. Let's go ahead and blame the video.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. Right from the start, Eric, everybody said...PERINO: No. No.WILLIAMS: ... the video is responsible for the unrest in the Middle East.BOLLING: No, no, Juan. This is -- this is...GUILFOYLE: No.WILLIAMS: And what happened? The very next day...BOLLING: The same night she e-mails her own daughter and says, it looks like an al Qaeda attack.GUILFOYLE: Al Qaeda.WILLIAMS: Correct.BOLLING: And the next day she says, ""No, no, there's no protest here.""WILLIAMS: At that point she didn't know that the video was actually a part of instigating this attack.BOLLING: There's nothing to do with the film.WILLIAMS: Right, because at that point she said you know what? This looks like it's separate from what happened in the rest of the Middle East. This looks like it was a planned terrorist attack.PERINO: You know what's going to happen by the next commercial break? We're going to find out that Hillary Clinton gets a note and she's like, ""Let me -- I think I need to further clarify so that -- make sure that no one that is trying to defend me is actually not making any sense.""WILLIAMS: Yes, but that...PERINO: Then we'll know that they're watching ""The Five.""WILLIAMS: Yes. I think that's right. And then we would know that, in fact, the heart of the opposition, Hillary's enemies, right here on ""The Five.""BOLLING: No, no. The only one actually taking her words and using them. I'm sure the other networks aren't doing it right now.WILLIAMS: Yes, well, you take it out of context.BOLLING: They're doing some -- they're doing some cat videos, maybe.WILLIAMS: Take it out of context; just take it out of context. That's the best you can do.GUILFOYLE: No, no, no, no, no.BOLLING: Whoa, whoa, time-out. There's no other context.WILLIAMS: There is a context.BOLLING: There is no other context.WILLIAMS: No other context...BOLLING: None.WILLIAMS: ... about what's going on the rest of the Middle East?BOLLING: None whatsoever.WILLIAMS: And Americans under attack?BOLLING: She just says within 24 hours of the attack that it has nothing to do with the video. It was a planned terror attack.GUILFOYLE: Yes. Because they've got no protest. And nothing recorded.BOLLING: ... two weeks, making up the story.WILLIAMS: Oh, gosh.BOLLING: We got to go.GUTFELD: You can't trust somebody with that kind of common sense or lack of common sense. She's like a shopkeeper at noon. She's out to lunch.BOLLING: All right. We're going to leave it right there. Next, some breaking 2016 news, someone has just managed to out-Trump Donald Trump in a state where the first presidential election contest will take place, otherwise known as Iowa. Who's now ahead of the Donald in Iowa? Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Donald Trump loves to brag that he's winning in all the polls, but that's not the case anymore. Ben Carson has now surpassed Trump in Iowa with an eight-point lead over the GOP frontrunner. Carson is ahead 28-20.How is the Donald handling this news? Well, he retweeted this from one of his supporters. It appears to insult voters in Iowa. ""Ben Carson is now leading in the polls in Iowa. Too much Monsanto in the corn creates issues in the brain.""Well, he must have gotten a lot of pushback for that, because hours later, he passed the blame, tweeting, ""The young intern who accidentally did a retweet apologizes.""K.G., you buy it?GUILFOYLE: I don't know. I mean, is it possible? Sure. Is it probably a good idea that he said that? Yes. And it wasn't something that he wrote himself. So somebody did retweet it. It's just a matter of who pushed the retweet.GUTFELD: What kind of candidate -- what kind of candidate trusts their Twitter account to an intern? I mean, that's crazy.GUILFOYLE: A lot.GUTFELD: You don't...WILLIAMS: Yes, a lot.GUTFELD: You don't -- you do not do that. I mean, the fact is, he promises that, when he's going to become president, that he's going to find the best people, the best people to fill these positions. If you're running for president, you don't have an intern running your -- that's why I don't think it's an intern.WILLIAMS: Right. Repeat what you said. Because I think -- I agree with you so much and it's so rare. Go right ahead.GUILFOYLE: That, in fact, I think it is possible that a lot of people do it, yes.WILLIAMS: Yes, I think lots of politicians have interns running it.GUTFELD: That's a problem. Well, then -- then the charm and the humor that we've come to love from Trump is not Trump at all. It's some 18-year- old.WILLIAMS: Well, that's possible, but it could be that this one is one that -- but anyway...GUILFOYLE: Who pushed the retweet? Who did it?GUTFELD: We need hearings. We need hearings.WILLIAMS: We'll call hearings here at ""The Five"" shortly. What do you think? What do you think?BOLLING: I think -- well, first of all, we've all retweeted stuff we probably shouldn't have.GUILFOYLE: Bolling. Bolling.BOLLING: We get in trouble for it once in a while.Aside from that, it was a -- it was quoting a tweet. It wasn't even a retweet. It was quoting a tweet. So maybe he lets interns quote, we'd say, things that are provocative. I'm sure if it was an original Donald Trump quote, an intern wouldn't have -- wouldn't have put that out. But I guess that's the way to handle it.WILLIAMS: Well, I want to go to my personal P.R. adviser, Ms. Dana Perino, and say, Dana, I think the people that really got hurt here is Monsanto.PERINO: I would say it was the people of Iowa, who actually then can all pull together and say, ""Excuse us, you can't say that."" But they're already doing it.I mean, Ben Carson is -- he's even on book tour. I mean, he's like on TV a little bit. He's not even campaigning and he's doing...But the evangelical Christians, of which there are many in Iowa, and they're active, they like Ben Carson's message.You know, and both Carson and Trump have been -- Trump's been ahead. But Carson's been right behind him in several of the polls. And they're just two very different people.WILLIAMS: But you know what?PERINO: Very different styles. And Carson...WILLIAMS: I noticed in the polls, speaking about evangelicals, is it's really women, that women are going to Carson...PERINO: Shocker.WILLIAMS: ... and away from...PERINO: Could you come pick me up off the floor? I'm just so shocked by that. Obviously, that is -- he had the 10-point gender gap with women.WILLIAMS: Yes, but Eric -- but Eric's people are sticking with Trump, the men.BOLLING: ""Eric's people, the men""?WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: My wife thinks Ben Carson is amazing, also.GUILFOYLE: I like him.BOLLING: There's this other poll. Did you see the Massachusetts poll?WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: Forty-eight percent leaning Republicans pick Trump. It's crazy. How does one state go 48 percent in favor; one state, he drops?GUTFELD: I don't know. But I've got a -- what do you call Kris Kringle when he delivers genetically modified foods?WILLIAMS: You got me, Greg.GUTFELD: Mon Santa. I was just thinking it (ph).WILLIAMS: Oh, you know, you're too good, Gregory.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.WILLIAMS: You're too good, Gregory.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: ""One More Thing"" up next.GUILFOYLE: Terrible.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: It's time now for ""One More Thing"" -- Dana.PERINO: All right. There was an op-ed in ""The Wall Street Journal"" today that caught my eyes by Bjorn Lomborg. I encourage you to check it out. This is what basically the message is.That the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development analyzed about 70 percent of all total global development aid. One in four of those dollars goes to climate. Then, get this: at the same time, malnourishment claims 1.4 million children's lives each year; 1.2 billion people live in extreme poverty; and 2.6 billion lack clean drinking water.He makes a very persuasive case that people who are suffering today should not be denied energy. Our organization here in the United States that invests in energy projects is not allowed to do anything with natural gas. They can only invest in renewables. That's actually costing lives overseas, and we should be held account to that while we're here on this planet, living now.GUTFELD: Well done.PERINO: So there.GUILFOYLE: Fantastic. Well done, Dana Perino.PERINO: Now on to more fun things with Kimberly Guilfoyle.GUILFOYLE: Yes, like kicking an extra point. So this is an must-see video. Take a look. This is homecoming queen, and her name is Jodie Farnetti. Her dad is in the final season, coach for the team. And she successfully kicked -- how cool is that -- The extra point for her team.You know, a love a girl that can play ball. You love it?BOLLING: Yes, it's great. Great.GUILFOYLE: And ""FOX and Friends"" tomorrow, please get up with me early in the morning. Very early.PERINO: That is very early.BOLLING: All right. So I admit it. I was really excited to see the Cubs in the World Series, first time since 1945. I even mentioned the ""Back to the Future"" prediction thingie. Yes, well, this happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On the way. And it's in there, strike three called. The Mets win the pennant. The New York Mets have won the National League pennant! Put it in the box!(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So I'll just go back to being another heartbroken Cubs fan.PERINO: Aww.GUILFOYLE: Aww.BOLLING: And by the way, congratulations, Mets fans. It was quite a performance.GUILFOYLE: When you're hot, you're hot.BOLLING: Yes.GUILFOYLE: That's the thing.GUTFELD: Thank you.GUILFOYLE: Well -- not you.GUTFELD: Oh, I'm sorry.GUILFOYLE: But you are up next.GUTFELD: I am next. Let's roll this, please.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Diet Tips(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: As you know, I've been focused entirely on Halloween. It's important that you eat healthily during that time, because you can end up eating too much sugar and then passing out on the street. Take a look at this young man.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(PORCUPINE EATING A SMALL PUMPKIN)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: He's enjoying -- listen to him, he's enjoying the beta carotene from a fresh pumpkin. Isn't that delightful?GUILFOYLE: Is that Alec?GUTFELD: Alec Baldwin? Yes, it's Alec Baldwin.He's hirsute. He's quite hirsute. Is that the word? Hirsute?GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: Yes.GUTFELD: All right. I've had enough of this. I want Juan to talk so I can yell at him.GUILFOYLE: So cute.WILLIAMS: Yes, all right.GUILFOYLE: So hairy.WILLIAMS: So sometimes, as I look around this building with all of these nuts, I get inspired. And that happened this past weekend with my friend Harris Faulkner, because she walked 39 miles this past weekend for the Avon Walk to End Breast Cancer.She did 26 miles around New York City on Saturday, 13 miles along the Hudson on Sunday.PERINO: Wow.WILLIAMS: And this is very personal. Her Aunt Mary has been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. So that diagnosis came in the spring. So best wishes to Aunt Mary and boy, Harris, you inspire us. You did good.PERINO: That's impressive.GUILFOYLE: All right. So set your DVR so you never miss an episode of ""The Five."" That's it for us.
