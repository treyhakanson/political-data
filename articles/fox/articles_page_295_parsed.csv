(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)Harry Reid, Senate Majority Leader: The one thing that we are going to do, during this work period sooner rather than later. Is to ensure that women's lives are not determined by virtue of five white men. This Hobby Hobby decision is outrageous.(END VIDEO CLIP)Of course the problem is-- five white men did not write the decision.The majority included Justice Clarence Thomas -- who is in fact African-American.Former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain tweets -- ""Harry Reid's Koch addiction is making him see white people. Harry-- Clarence Thomas is black!""Baking LimitsFederal government nutrition guidelines-- could cost big money for local schools-- and extra-curricular activities that rely on food sale fundraisers.In Tennessee -- state officials are limiting such events to just 30 days per school year -- in order to comply with the federal law's vague reference to infrequent.The Tennessean reports -- even state education leaders are frustrated.Quote-- ""If somebody wants to object to federal intrusion in what's going on in schools -- I think this would be an ideal place to target.""Another official mocked the rules allowing healthy food sales-- ""If I thought I could generate revenue selling carrot sticks, I could tear it up.""Not All Press Is Good PressFinally -- if you are on the run from the law -- you probably should not agree to have your picture published in the newspaper.Jacob Close posed for a photo-- to accompany his opinion on the Washington Redskins name controversy-- in a Pennsylvania newspaper feature.Police saw the picture -- and arrested him for an outstanding warrant for jumping bail.His opinion on football team?Keep the Redskins name -- but change the mascot to a potato.
