Rand Paul filibuster	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" March 6, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Rand Paul live on the Senate floor continuing his filibuster.SEN. RAND PAUL, R - KY:  -- they're going to have different rules but we already know that a large percentage of the drone strikes overseas were not naming the person. Is that going to be the standard?We also know that we have targeted people for sympathizing with the enemy.  We talked about that before. In the 1960's we had many people who sympathized with North Vietnam. Many people will remember Jane Fonda swiveling herself around in the North Vietnamese artilleries and thinking gleefully that she was just right at home with the North Vietnamese. Now, I'm not a great fan of Jane Fonda. I'm really not so interested in putting her on a drone kill list either.BAIER: OK Rand Paul, he has talked about a lot of things today. We just noticed he wolfed down a Snickers and some jelly beans. It doesn't look like he is going anywhere anytime soon. A.B., what about Rand Paul? He is obviously raising his profile. He is said to be considering a run for president.A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: Well, and this is an interesting -- everyone loves a filibuster in Washington. This is -- and everyone loves regular order. The fact that he is willing to stand there and go through this is quite impressive. He has actually done a good job, if you've listened to him. He is pretty articulated and prepared.He actually at one point  did say though, it's not so much about filibustering the nomination of John Brennan so much as it is, as he said, a request to get the President of the United States to say that no Americans would be killed if they are not engaged in combat. And that is likely to happen. I don't think that this effort to codify the drone policy that Charles is talking about and that Eric Holder, the attorney general, talked about today in his testimony saying that eventually the White House is going to try to come up with steps to create some transparency on this, it's not going to happen while Rand Paul is standing there. But he is going to be remembered for this, and, I think that is what he wanted.BAIER: At the same time, Steve, the president is having dinner with seven other Republicans. They won't be joining the filibuster. Nine others have, so far including the Democrat we told you about earlier, Ron Wyden. What about the politics of all this and how this all plays out?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: We are at this fascinating moment where the president has exported law enforcement techniques overseas. That's why we didn't have access to Ali Harzi, the Benghazi suspect, it's because it was focused on law enforcement and he is bringing counter terror measures from overseas back to the United States, at least in theory. I think it's a good moment for Rand Paul. I think he made strong, principled arguments, even if you didn't agree with him. He clearly knew his stuff. And I think it gets him the attention he wants.BAIER: Last word.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: It's a stroke of political genius. He will be remembered. This raises his image and he is completely sincere about this. I think he will be -- this will be a moment that people will say launched him as a national figure.BAIER: That is it for the panel. But stay tuned, well, we'll stay on the topic of drones and transparency.  Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

 Politics Behind President's Debt Speech 
"	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" April 13, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Before the break, we asked you would you be willing to pay higher taxes in order to help decrease the debt? Only six percent said of you said yes in this poll, 94 percent said no.Now back with panel about the politics of today. There was a lot of back and forth between the two main players.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT: There is nothing serious about a plan that claims to reduce deficit by spending $1 trillion on tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. To meet our fiscal challenge we will need to make reforms, we will all need to make sacrifices. But we do not have to sacrifice the America we believe in. And as long as I'm president we won't.REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: What we heard today was not fiscal leadership from our Commander in chief. What we heard today was a political broadside from our campaigner in chief. I guess it's no coincidence that last week when the president launched his billion dollar re-election campaign was the week we launched our effort to try and get this debt and deficit under control and get our economy growing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Now a number of folks noted one interesting moment in the speech, Vice President Biden was either meditating about the speech, the president's plan, or he may have been a little bit tired. We're not sure there, but we had to show it before we got back to the panel on the politics. John, what about who is winning and losing this political battle here?JOHN FUND, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, I think the Ryan budget has changed terms of debate in Washington. That's why the president was smoked out. He had to come up with something other than the budget that was discredited two months ago.BAIER: Yeah, let's point out he had the State of the Union, and then his budget roll out, both opportunities to do really what he did today.FUND: Right, and now he appears before a bunch of college students and says, oh by the way, here's my plan. It looks a little forced. I think that we are in for a long stalemate, as I said. I don't think either side is going to budge. I think the president is going to go into the 2012 campaign as a class warrior. I think the Republicans are going to go in saying we're not going to budge on taxes whatsoever for any income bracket. And that's the terms of the debate that are going to play out.The president, by the way, is sticking with Obamacare and he's going to say that's going to restrain healthcare costs. Increasingly, as Obamacare kicks in, I think that is becoming less and less likely.BAIER: A.B.?A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: Well, there were actually three opportunities for the president to come to the table. In December, he ignored the recommendations of his own debt commission and then in January at the State of the Union he did it again. And then with his budget in February he [INAUDIBLE] again. So this is now the undoing of his February budget and it's a new plan.That said, there is something that has to break the stalemate, and that's the increase on the debt ceiling and that has to come in the next two months. And so we can sit around and talk about Republicans opposing the sun setting of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. That's two years from now. I mean that's -- in May of 2011, he can't push that through the vote in the Congress.What we're talking about now is what are the concessions that the Democrats are going to give Republicans to join in on an increase on the debt ceiling and avert the unthinkable? A government shutdown was possible. This is not possible. And the Republican leadership knows it and the people who fund their campaigns are freaking out on them behind the scenes. So that is actually a deadline that's coming. And as of tonight, there is no beginnings of consensus of how they'll get them.FUND: I think Harry Reid has a plan to get the debt limit through the Senate. If no senator objects you don't need 60 votes to pass the debt limit. You can do it with a simple majority. And that means --BAIER: Yes, but you mean to tell me that the DeMints or the Coburns or somebody is not going to object?FUND: Well, then the onus [INAUDIBLE] falls on the Republicans. And that's probably what Harry Reid wants.BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: Look, I don't know how many times he gets a swing at the ball before people recognize that he's not serious about the debt. As A.B. pointed out, he had his commission, he ignored it, he had the State of the Union, which is astonishing. He didn't use the word debt until he was more than halfway through that speech. And then, of course, in the budget which does nothing except explode the debt.The fact is, as A.B. mentioned, that his people called up the Gang of Six on Sunday and said hurry up with the plan, and the plan doesn't even exist, tells you how fictional is Obama's so-called plan.BAIER: But are Democrats happy with this?KRAUTHAMMER: He wants to incorporate a plan that actually doesn't even exist.BAIER: Are Democrats happy with this today? Are they --KRAUTHAMMER: I think this speech was a speech to his base, no one else. And what he was saying is, I'm really smart. Let me show you that I'm with you on this, opposing any real cuts but I'm smart enough that I'll pretend that I'm a cutter and I'm a deficit reducer and I will work across the aisle as I did in 2008. I can get away with it. I'm clever. I'll show you how I can do it. I'll do it in half of this speech and I'll run all the way until Election Day next year, demagoguing Ryan and pretending I'm a centrist.BAIER: That --FUND: I was here it for Bill Clinton; when Bill Clinton pulled that. Bill Clinton was much better than Barack Obama at that game.BAIER: That is it for the panel. But stay tuned as one of our own gets an extreme makeover.Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2011 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

 Politics behind Ryan plan to lower deficit 
"	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" March 20, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN, R - WI HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We propose to sav e and strengthen Medicare by taking power away from government bureaucrats.REP. XAVIER BECERRA, D - CA.: It ends the Medicare guarantee for seniors. It cuts obviously benefits to seniors who need health care.RYAN: We propose to collapse the six different tax brackets into two rates, a 10 percent bracket and a 25 percent bracket for individuals.JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Hey, I'm going to give you a tax break and, hey, I'm going to eliminate the AMT, and then have no details on how you would pay for them.REP. JOHN BOEHNER, R - OHIO HOUSE SPEAKER: Our budget will protect seniors and really begin to deal with these tremendous deficits that have been driven up by this administration.CARNEY: It is not a plan that this president could support.(END VIDEOTAPE)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: The reaction today to House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan laying out a sweeping reform. The Republican budget includes, as you heard there, bringing down the tax brackets from six to two, 10 and 25 percent, corporate tax rate at 25 percent and federal spending cuts of $5.3 trillion over the next 10 years.What about this, the way forward politically and in this policy? Let's bring in our special expanded panel from Washington. Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, and Brit Hume, Fox News senior political analyst.Mara, start with you, your thought of this budget and what it means politically?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, I think what it means politically is Republicans now have something to rally around. It's simple in terms of tax reform, two rates. Cuts spending a lot, which is something that Republicans want.The big piece that's missing really is they say they want to get rid of tax expenditures that's how they're going to do this tax reform, they're going to broaden the base while they're lowering rates, but they don't say what tax expenditures they're going to cut. So I think that's a question that still remains to be answered. They haven't said yet exactly what income levels will go into the tax bracket. But I do think it's clear. It does say that it's going to solve the problem and it gives Republicans something to run on, and that's important.BAIER: Bill?BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes. I think it is what the Republican nominee's going to run on and I suspect it's what the Republican president, if there is one in January of 2013, will govern on. So I think in some very important way this is now Paul Ryan's party, at least when it comes to budgetary matters, fiscal matters, debt, deficit and Medicare reform, which is an awful lot of things. And incidentally, he also addresses defense. As you know they're this sequester which is hanging over everyone which would impose brutal cuts on the defense budget next year. And he didn't have to do this as budget chairman, but he also shows a way to get out of the sequester, take the cuts out of mandatory, domestic spending programs, so you get to the same deficit reduction number, this is in next year, without destroying defense, which is something that is awfully important to a lot of conservatives, including me.So I think what Paul Ryan has done is really a task of intellectual and political leadership, and it will now be up to him and his colleagues and above all to the Republican presidential candidate to make the case that this is a better way forward than President Obama's.BAIER: To that point, Brit, two reactions, one from Mitt Romney about this budget plan, saying, quote, today, ""The House Republican budget rejects the out-of-control spending and higher taxes proposed by President Obama in his budget last month, by imposing prescriptions that will strengthen Medicare for generations to come. It also highlights President Obama's failed leadership on entitlement reform."" Newt Gingrich saying, ""The House GOP budget is a courageous plan that correctly understands the key to returning to a balanced budget is robust economic growth, spending control, and bold entitlement reform,"" a much different answer from Newt Gingrich, for example, from a year ago.BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: That's true, Bret. And let's underscore what is really critical about what Paul Ryan is proposing here. The big driver of deficit spending, the big out of control program is Medicare. He proposes to change Medicare from a program of an open-ended program of basically unlimited benefits where the only way you can press the cost is by taking out of the hides of medical providers, which really doesn't work, it makes medical care less available, and he imposes limits on it.It is going to be very hard to pass that. It won't pass this year, certainly won't pass this year. It will never pass with Democrats in control of the Senate and the White House. Paul Ryan clearly believes that at some point a day of reckoning is coming. Medicare will collapse of its own weight if something isn't done to change it. He is betting that it's time to put himself and his party on the side of avoiding what he calls the most predictable fiscal crisis the country's ever faced.That is the key here. It's going to take guts for these House Republicans to go along with it. It looks like the presidential candidates are going to support it. That's an encouraging sign for what Ryan is trying to do. But make no mistake about it, the big item here, the tough one is Medicare because that's the big driver.BAIER: We should point out there was no statement from Rick Santorum. Ron Paul said that the budget doesn't really cut anything, any spending.Charles, the political danger here is that Democrats, obviously, and they already started today, will pounce on this and try to turn the discussion. How successful can they have doing that -- will they have, doing that in this environment?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, they already had a campaign on last year's Ryan budget, the ""Medi-scare"" campaign, which was in part, dishonest. They said it abolishes Medicare, in fact it just changed it, amended it, and changed it in different ways.They're gonna have a harder case today because the new Ryan approach makes one major tweak. He got Ron Wyden, the Democratic senator of Oregon, to join him in a joint proposal where you do change Medicare from a guaranteed program of provider payments, meaning fee-for-service, into one where you guarantee the premium, the cost of the insurance.However, what he added now in this budget is a provision that if you want to choose the old traditional Medicare, you can do that. So now any Democrat who charges that it abolishes current Medicare is not speaking the truth. They will try that. They will say it. They said it today already. But it simply isn't so. It's one of the options that is offered. And that was a very important change.And remember, the House Republicans approved the budget last year without a provision of that sort. So now I think they have some kind of political protection. And it will make the argument -- the dishonest argument of the Democrats of abolishing Medicare a lot more it difficult.BAIER: Mara, you look at this chart and Paul Ryan used this today, citing the OMB and CBO numbers and he says it's the two paths that go forward. And basically this budget calls for federal spending reductions over the next 10 years of $5.3 trillion, and he points out that the current path continues to go up as a percentage of GDP to debt.LIASSON: Look, what he is doing is trying to get the discussion, the election-year debate, back onto the deficit. It's kind of remarkable. We went through this whole year of one commission after another laying out paths to bringing the deficit under control, how you could do tax reform, how you could raise revenues with tax reform, how you could cut spending, how you could do this, that, and the other thing. And they all laid out more or less the same plan with slightly different tweaks.And then it dropped, it just disappeared into a black hole, and you haven't heard these candidates talking much about it. But I do think now that Ryan has come out with this, I think this will get more talk from the Republican candidates.BAIER: Bill, the Senate has not passed a budget in quite some time.KRISTOL: Right.BAIER: I think it's 1,060 days. There is probably very little hope that this budget has a chance anywhere near the Senate.KRISTOL: No. But Republicans really need to make the case that it should be passed. And Mara's right that they need to get back to the urgency of the deficit and the debt. The debt has gone up from slightly under $10 trillion when Barack Obama became president to slightly over $15 trillion. It's gone up 56 percent. It is totally unsustainable. And under Barack Obama - under President Obama's budget, the debt continues to go up at almost that rate.And the Republicans reduce the rate of growth of the debt. It turns over in a couple of years, so to speak, as a percentage of GDP, and starts to go down. I think the Republicans and presidential candidates are busy squabbling with each other and worrying about things and they're not making the case for the urgency of the kinds of Medicare reforms and other reforms that the Ryan budget presents.HUME: Let's not forget Bret, that this issue of spending and out of control debt is what drove the 2010 election. So I think that sentiment that drove that is still out there to be tapped.BAIER: Panel, thank you very much for the Brady Bunch version.
