READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.DONALD TRUMP REVAMPS CAMPAIGN TEAM, MESSAGING WITH ELECTION DAY CLOSING INMercedes Schlapp: I think that obviously the economy remains the top issue for American voters.   However, I think that for Donald Trump it's important to come across being the compassionate American businessman.  I think this is part of what you're seeing in the campaign. What does he need to do? He needs to attract more suburban women to support him. Obviously increase his number of independents that would support him. He's fine with his base. This is great. But you need to also think about what women want to see. They want to see more of, not only can you come and fix the economy, but show us that you care.    Gina Loudon: I wouldn't call it a shakeup.  I've said from the beginning that Trump knows a couple of   things very well. This is where his experience, his acumen is serving him. He knows how to surround himself with good people.  He knows timing. He knows when to peak. I think that's exactly what he's doing. He knew that he didn't need to peak when everybody was panicking about the polls. We're starting to see those coming together. And you see that now that he's made some of these campaign changes, I think Hillary Clinton's in real trouble.  He's proving he can be authentic and read from a prompter.  What in the world is she going to do?  Jessica Tarlov: I think this was always going to be a close race in terms of the vote.  I'm not sure about the Electoral College now and all of the maps look absolutely disastrous for the GOP. I wanted touch on something Gina said. This is obviously a shakeup. He's totally restructured the top of his campaign.   I think it's a smart move. I respect Kellyanne Conway enormously. But I would say that Steve Bannon; his tactics almost undo what it is that she's there to do. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw trump going off teleprompter a little, as well, too. That's something that shored up his base. I don't think it plays as well in the general election crowd. I don't think we'll have teleprompter Don for the next 80 days.   Ric Grenell:  I think it's definitely a big shakeup.  I think Jessica's right. It was needed. But look, I disagree with her a little bit in that Donald Trump's problem is just with GOP voters. If he can bring them home, the numbers show, and a lot of people in D.C. don't want to admit this, but Trump is doing better than Romney with nonwhite voters and categories except for with Republicans. He needs to bring Republicans   home. The combination of Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway is exactly playing to that. They are tried and true Republicans. They know the base and know conservatives.  I think the combination of them is going to help bring republicans home.Jehmu Grenne: There are 80 days. We've had 430 days of verbal carnage. To Mercedes and Richard's point about Republican women, he just named a CEO for his campaign that wrote a headline that said   ""birth control makes women unattractive and crazy."" I'm not sure that's going to play to Republican women, moderate women out there.$400M CASH PAYMENT TO IRAN WAS TIED TO RELEASE OF 4 AMERICANS/ RUSSIAN FIGHTER JETS USING IRANIAN BASES TO LAUNCH AIRSTRIKES AGAINST SYRIAN REBELSRic Grenell: They won. They got a ransom. This line from the White House that somehow it wasn't a ransom because it was a settlement of the 39-year agreement fails to understand that it wasn't a   diplomatic opening if it's an immediate payment. The Wall Street Journal did a good job of showing exactly what happened. The payment was held until the prisoners were released. That immediacy totally shows that this wasn't a diplomatic opening or an opportunity as President Obama says. It was total ransom.  Gina Loudon: You kill Americans and you become a top terrorist sponsor in the world, and pretty much    all bets are off.  I think that America needs to make that clear. I would invite our liberal friends here on the panel to explain to me something that I don't understand. Either these two, Hillary Clinton and Obama, are completely incompetent leaders or they're working against American interest.  Jessica Tarlov: I think my liberal body downstairs would say the same, too. Totally insane, Gina.   To Ric's point, I understand the ransom argument. We know the $400 million was originally theirs.   We negotiated a deal with them, which by the way, we know that nuclear physicists and arms experts across the world have said it was the best deal we could've gotten. And then we said, hey guess what? We want our guys back, which I think that we should.Jehmu Grenne: Why are we talking it this when this was reported in January of this year? I can go back to January. I weighed 20 pounds less, and I still had a boyfriend, come on.  We're talking about this because Donald Trump created another of his conspiracies when he said he saw the cash coming off the   plane. There was transparency in January. We have got to stop trying to gin up these conspiracies. And guess what? This happened after secretary Clinton had left the state department.Mercedes Schlapp: First of all, I can't believe we're even joking about this because of the fact that we had American hostages held for quite some time. It was under Pastor Sayeed that this revelation came out, plus the Wall Street Journal talking about they were holding this money, $400 million. The Obama administration denies it. This is appalling. This is not how we should be running our foreign policy. It is one of the problems that we see where Iran looks at the U.S., and looks at us as this weak country willing to give concessions to Iran while they play us like a fiddle.  I think this is incredibly serious.  ELLEN DEGENERES ACCUSED OF RACISM AFTER TWEETING MEME OF USAIN BOLTJehmu Grenne: I don't think this too P.C. social media is going to be the death of us all. But I think in the last year, Donald Trump has mainstreamed   megalomaniacs across social media.  Mercedes Schlapp: I think we have to be respectful and understand the fact that there is high tension now between the African-American community and other communities. I think when you look at -You're blaming it on Donald Trump, Jehmu; Maybe it's a little more of the black lives matter, too.  Maybe just try to find a space where we can all respect each other.  Gina Loudon: This is conservative poetry. This is the moment where we can sit and hope that the liberals can understand what their rhetoric has done. The P.C police have been such a problem for conservatives, and now it's backfired on them. So I'm just hoping that Ellen DeGeneres is one of those people who will quietly step in the ballot box and vote for trump to get rid of this.  Ric Grenell: I have zero sympathy for Ellen. She is a left-winger who has played into this identity politics for a very long time. She's getting exactly what she deserves. She's getting a taste of her own medicine.  Jessica Tarlov: I thought it was really funny, actually. The backlash, I get that.  Liberals are to blame    Substantially for the P.C police issue. To quote Mayor Mike Bloomberg who sat at an address in Michigan University, micro aggressions are just that, micro. I want to say that when we freak out about things like this it detracts from real racism and bigotry.  "	['Romney', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.New Look at Potential Financial Fallout in Wake of Lochte ScandalJohn Layfield: It's going to impact it. It's going to end the endorsements unfortunately. Look, he makes you mix famous people and notoriety and alcohol this was a stupid thing. This is going to cost him significantly because Ryan Lochte does not have a second act. You know, Michael Phelps had a problem with drinking and came back and competed magnificently in the Olympics. People have forgotten that. Andy Pettitte, Jason Giambi, issues with PEDs, they came back and played well. Compare that to Ben Johnson and Mark McGwire and Roger Clemens, never had a second act to get over the allegations and because of that, they lost all these endorsements going forward. The last thing remembered is what you know about the athletes especially in America. Unfortunately this is the last thing that will be remembered for Ryan Lochte and his endorsement future is very nil.Chuck Rocha: I've been on ""Bulls & Bears"" off and on and we got a topic I'm an expert at. Nothing ever happens good coming out of a bar at 5 o'clock in the morning. I remember one time when I wrecked my papa's truck, thank God no cameras following me 24/7 I would have lost that Coors Lite and Copenhagen sponsorship. With these young men, just what my good friend just said, is that it may be over forever, but again, if you think about America and the second chances, if he owns up to it and goes I did something really stupid, you've done something really stupid, let's get over this and be really sincere about what he's saying, I think the boy could have a second chance and he's not a boy, he's 32 years old. By that time I had a 13-year-old kid. He needs to be talked to like a man.Emily Jashinsky: So here, you know, Lochte is a risk that companies don't have to take. This does help him in one key area. Think about it, the man is already a reality star. This just makes him more attractive to the networks that are looking for the eager for that reality TV content. Give him a show, I will be watching.Gary B. Smith: Exactly. But I tell you what, I think he's done. I think he's finished for a variety of reasons. John hit on one. First of all, he's no Michael Phelps, never was. He got a lot of medals in relays and was a great swimmer, but not a super star like Phelps, like Ledecky. That's number one. He will not come back. You saw it in the Olympics. His performance was average at best. Number two, he didn't just sully himself like a Tiger Woods, he sullied a country. People are a little less forgiving for that. Number three, he made the critical mistake, he didn't fall on his sword immediately. He issued an apology which was basically whatever. The same kind of thing he said to Billy Bush or one of those guys. So he didn't do that. It was more like hey, I'm sorry I got caught. This guy is toast. There are so many other athletes out there that sponsors can choose from that have sterling reputations and have never done anything wrong, at least not publicly. Lochte will never get another endorsement deal.Jonas Max Ferris: My original reaction was like Gary's but I think not only will he get a second act, this is his act. Look, if you style your hair and shave your body and got 130 pairs of expensive shoes in your closet, every so often you have to kick in a gas bathroom door to show people you are tougher than you are. His reality show is being re-aired on esquire. He's benefiting. He's no Michael Phelps, Michael Phelps, absorbs all the sponsorship money. They make little money in the grand scheme of thing. If your sponsor is a mattress company you can lose a few sponsors if you get another reality show. Look at his long-term career projections they're not in the NBA, not a lot of paydays for swimmers.Companies Donating Supplies, Money to Help Victims of Louisiana FloodingGary B. Smith: Absolutely. I guess it depends on how one would define good if you just look at the cash they donate in 2015, the top 20 Fortune 500 companies, less than 10 percent of the population, they alone donated $3.5 billion in cash. Walmart alone gave $300 million. I guess, like I said, it depends on what you define as good but to me that's darn good and that's giving and caring.Emily Jashinsky: Yeah. You know this is interesting because I think we're in a time where anti-business, anti-corporate sentiments are growing on both sides really of the aisle and for a story like this; it might show people the corporate world in a different light. I think Americans really are study after study shows the most charitable people in the world and this is, you know, they're really showcases this in a great way. A moment to be proud of our country.John Layfield: I think Americans overall are very generous. And that includes American businesses as well. Look at what they're calling the Cajun navy, the people in Louisiana that are helping their neighbors going out in their canoes and so many of them, see them all over the place. Look, I've run for the last six years health run, an at risk group of at risk charity organization that I founded and over 90 percent of our sponsorship comes from international business and high net worth. When I go around the country I visit a lot more at risk just like mine and about 90 percent also is international or big business or high net worth. But the demagoguery in politics it's a populist thing to bash these guys. They do an awful lot of good much more than the government. The government does not do charity very well.Jonas Max Ferris: Look, I think it's all good and however you get to getting money to people is great, but let's not -- look, companies are doing this for a reason, because they get heat for often misses, but also negative behavior. This is branding. They would never use an uneconomic amount of money, somebody give $2 billion, because they shouldn't. It's a shareholder owned company. This is an amount that makes sense for their business and it's also companies that are trying to get ahead of future mill political attacks. Shell will give money and get heat for causing this on some level from some politician.Chuck Rocha: You know, we talk about lots of different topics on shows but the one thing that brings us together is things like this no matter if you're a corporation or individual, that john was talking about, who has that john boat down there going home to home looking for his neighbors, the same as the businesses that have to work and be around the people and help other folks. At the end of the day that's what brings us and makes us different than every other country in the world we do this for our neighbor. We don't ask what their skin color is how much money they make. If they're in need we will be there whether they're a corporation and on the first on this show to hold corporations accountable from time to time but in this light we're all Americans no matter if you own that business work at that business or in that john boat. This is what makes America great.Aetna Exiting Most Healthcare Exchanges After Losing $430M on ObamaCare PlansEmily Jashinsky: Of course this was their end game. Let's transport ourselves back to 2010, a fun trip back to 2009, 2010, when the battle was raging and kicked off the tea party. We have to pass the bill to find out what's in it. 2016 Finding out what's in it and when president Obama doesn't need re-election last month he comes out supporting the public option and the three leading democrats in the country, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama supporting the public option. They take over the economy. If you like the DMV you will love the public option coming soon.Chuck Rocha: I have ObamaCare, I have six employees and the more you spread the risk over a bigger pot of people the price should go down. I'm a Bernie Sanders fan and the more that we have people in the system, the cheaper it will be.Jonas Max Ferris: It's uneconomic to provide health insurance to old people, people with previous conditions and poor people. If the government doesn't -- you can't force corporate America to do it. It's almost impossible to make that work and not have this happen to Aetna or whoever. The government should have provided that with Medicare and Medicaid and leave the private market to handle the profitable normal part of the business.John Layfield: I think they wanted this but I don't think this was their plan all along. I think they had basically insurance reform and put more people on insurance rolls but no health care reform, no transparency or tort reform. This is a problem that needs to be fixed.Gary B. Smith: Well, to Chuck's point ask one person paying health care premiums if they're happy with ObamaCare. Everyone everyone's is sky rocketing. I would be all for government run health care if we could find government run anything that people are happy with. What the VA hospital? Amtrak? Medicare? Medicaid? Going broke, bankrupting states. Yeah, government run stuff is perfect for other countries, not for us.Stock PicksGary B.
