But as soon as he got back to the U.S.A., he repeated his policy of being tough on illegal aliens. There was some nuance but not much. And that is Mr. Trump's big gamble. He is hoping that American voters are fed up with the federal government that will not enforce immigration law, thereby allowing chaos to reign and actual harm to come to Americans like Kate Steinle.Republican ticket apparently believes there are many voters who are silently sick of permissive immigration policies in place for decades. They are sick of it. Remember, if you are outspoken about enforcing immigration laws, the left will brand you a nativist and perhaps even a racist. That's a vicious card to play. And it has inhibited speech to some extent. There is no question that illegal immigration is an explosive issue. One that allowed Donald Trump to win the Republican nomination. Again, it comes down to this.Are most American voters fed up with the anarchy? Tough question to answer because you can't count on the polls to indicate true feelings. As mentioned, many people shy away from openly supporting tough measures against illegal aliens, even though they may support them. For those voters, Trump offer as border wall, a crackdown on sanctuary cities and zero tolerance for aliens who commit crimes on American soil. That's a powerful lure for disenchanted voters. That being said, there is no question that Donald Trump will not, repeat, will not deport millions of aliens who have been peaceful while residing in the U.S.A. He seems to be moderating his position on that. More than a year ago, we discussed the issue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: I think you're right about the wall. I think you are wrong about the mass deportations and going into families. I think they have to be held accountable. And I think they have to be registered and they have to go through the process. But I can't possibly see how the courts, the federal courts are going to allow federal agents to kick doors in and drag people out.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now, at the time, Donald Trump disagreed with me so what's changed? Well, we'll talk with him about that in a moment. Although it's not directly linked, the race situation is also a problem for Mr. Trump. Truth is, African-Americans will not vote for him in any great numbers. Primarily because the Democratic Party retains credibility in the black precincts. Also, Donald Trump is identified as being a birther, someone who has questioned President Obama's citizenship and Black Americans did not like that.However it's very possible that African-Americans will not turn out in great numbers at the polls this coming November. Certainly Secretary Clinton is not as popular as President Obama with black voters. Donald Trump's foray to Detroit was a wise move even though the usual suspect slammed him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your platform as the leader of the Republican Party does not speak to a civil rights agenda. You are talking about civil rights when you are engaged in civil wrongs to the degree that your party doesn't speak to it, you have never spoken to it, and we don't know who Donald Trump really is.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now, it's almost amusing that Reverend Anthony excoriates the Republican Party's racial policies when the Democrats have allowed the city of Detroit, his city to be destroyed. Right before his own eyes. Politics trumping reality, pardon the pun, once again. Talking Points well understands that Donald Trump will have to overwhelmingly win the white vote to have any chance at being president. And last week's immigration and race story lines might have helped him. New CNN poll out today has Trump leading Hillary Clinton 49 to 48.When you factor in the other two alternative candidates, Trump wins 45 to 43. That's a big turnaround for mid-August. It was driven, according to CNN, by 90 percent of Republican voters now supporting Trump. Ninety percent. The ""L.A. Times"" daily tracking poll has the race tied. Trump 44, Clinton 44. NBC News has Clinton 48, Trump 42. In a four way race, Clinton 41, Trump 37. So, again, Trump is making some progress or so the polls say. But it all comes down to electoral votes.And here Donald Trump has some difficulty. Hillary Clinton is competing in states like Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. Those states usually both Republicans. Donald Trump needs to win those three, Florida, Ohio, and either Pennsylvania or Michigan to even be competitive in the Electoral College. That will not be easy. So summing up, Trump's tough stance on immigration looks to be a winner for him at this point. And the race deal is primarily symbolic. Blacks will vote for Mrs. Clinton.But with the debate coming up in less than three weeks. Trump still has a fighting chance. And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

Hundreds of them. It could have been thousands of them. And, my interviews with the candidates afterward in Detroit.Opinions were all over the place, which makes things very interesting. Talking points values perspective from you. So, this is a good time to analyze that. We begin with Dennis Dreher, who lives in Calgary, Canada: ""The three debate moderators claim to want to hear about policy but then instigate a hatchet job. Do you agree?""I do not agree. All four candidates were asked legitimate questions about policy and their political history. Inconsistencies on the part of the candidates about their policy records are, of course, fair game. How the candidates answer the questions is not up to the moderators. It is certainly instructive to see how these people, who are seeking power, handle themselves under pressure.So, sometimes what looks to be out of control is actually giving you some insight. I saw no sign of any hatchet, at the debate. Max Suzich, Simi Valley, California: ""I am 9 years old and if I talk the way those men at the debate did, my mom would ground me.""Politics is a rough business, Max. But, I agree maybe they should be grounded. Some of it is acting, though. Remember Chris Christie criticizing Donald Trump earlier in the campaign and vice versa? Now, they are pals. I am glad you are paying attention to your country.Angie Sims, Chicago: ""We are disappointed because you promised you would tell us who won the debate. We stayed up late, but you never gave your opinion."" At the beginning of the Kasich interview, I stated to the governor that he had the best policy argument, so that was my pick. His problem-solving rhetoric was superior in my opinion.Mike Porter, Flat Rock, Michigan: ""I see a concerted effort by Fox News to eliminate the republican frontrunner. The post debate interviews by O'Reilly appeared to be a set-up, standing up next to Trump, so O'Reilly could appear taller than he is. Then sitting down with the rest of the candidates.""Simply a matter of logistics. We opened ""The Factor"" on stage because our set was up in the balcony. It would have taken Trump too much time to get up there. During the first commercial break, the other guys had the time to make the trek as I did. But, let us address the more important question here. Political paranoia.There is no difference whether an interview is conducted standing or sitting. What is said is what is important. Your view of a contrive anti- Trump setup, because I am taller than he is speaks your fantasy that FNC seems to manipulate that viewers. It does not.Alan Neubauer, Kittredge, Colorado: ""Bill, your post-debate interview with Trump was excellent, serious journalism. You should go back to being a reporter and forget about commentary."" I never left being a reporter. All good analysis should be fact base.And that is what we are doing here. My interviews are based on what is actually happened, cause and effect. That is what I bring, and it is based on my decades of reporting experience.Randy Furness, Coupeville, Washington: ""Everybody knows why Kasich has not had the attention of Fox News and other media. You and others want a circus to entertain the masses. It is all about ratings."" We do not need a circus to get ratings. Is the murder of Kate Steinle a circus? How about the rise of ISIS?T.V. News does give airtime to the sensational but not exclusively. Governor Kasich has chosen to run a retail campaign, where he meets as many folks as possible, outlining his experience and accomplishments. We have reported and analyzed that. We cannot do it over and over and over.Now, a guy like Trump says something new and provocative nearly every day. So, obviously, he is going to get more coverage. We are in the news business. Accent on the word, ""New.""Kent Carroll, Prospect, Connecticut: ""I do not care what they say about Trump. He has never lied to me. The republican establishment has."" And, that is the cornerstone of Trump's support, that his point of view echoes that of Americans fed up with phony politicians, who fold on major issues.Also, that he rejects political correctness, which is battered the nation and suppressed opposing points of view. There is a powerful anger directed at the politics as usual crowd, and Mr. Trump has harnessed that anger into votes. It has been a brilliant strategy.Ed Zeglarsski, New Port Richey, Florida: ""Bill, I saw you baiting of Trump after the debate. It was negative."" Michelle Parkenham, Wisconsin: ""O'Reilly, it pains me to say it, but your fawning interview with Trump after the debate was cringe-worthy.""Now, I get opposite assessments every time I interview any politician. I baited Trump. I fawned over Trump. It cannot be both, but here is the danger. Increasingly in America folks are hearing what they want to hear, not what is actually being said. We live in a time where you can create your own world by using high tech gizmos. Outside of making a living, society no longer demands rationality on your part.You have to perform in the work place, and at school, or else you live in poverty. But, in your private life, you can create any scenario you want and lose complete touch with what is actually taking place. That new wave of behavior is sweeping over the political process and canny power seekers are harnessing emotion to achieve success. The kind of presentation has become the rule rather than the exception.Power can be a very dangerous thing. Americans should think long and hard before bestowing it on anyone. It is my job to keep it all real and fair. I believe I am doing moo my job. And, that is ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.
