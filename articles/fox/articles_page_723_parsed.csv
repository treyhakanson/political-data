This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Factor Follow-Up Segment"" tonight, you may remember the horrific video out of Philadelphia last week, an armed man storming a police car, shooting the officer three times. But Jesse Hartnett survived and actually shot his assailant.The suspect 30-year-old Edward Archer said he shot the policeman in the name of Islam. But the mayor of Philadelphia doesn't believe that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR ELECT, JIM KENNEY (D), PHILADELPHIA: In no way, shape, or form does anyone in this room believe that Islam or the teaching of Islam has anything to do with what you have seen on that screen. This is a criminal with a stolen gun who tried to kill one of our officers -- has nothing to do with being a Muslim or following the Islamic faith.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Joining us now from Philadelphia Chris Stigall, radio talk show host on WPHT-AM. Let's walk through this guy Archer. He is a Muslim, correct?CHRIS STIGALL, RADIO HOST: Correct. He says so.O'REILLY: His mother says so, and he attends a mosque in Philadelphia and the imam of the mosque first lied to the police about knowing Archer and then said, after the police came back, yes, do I know him. Is that all correct?STIGALL: That's the strangest component of the story to me. Otherwise, the confession of Edward Archer was straightforward. He did it and he said he did it to pledge allegiance to ISIS. He said that Koran is crossways with police work in Philadelphia and elsewhere. He said Islam motivated him to do it.And the officer said in that press conference with the mayor moments prior to him making those comments you just played that that's, in fact, why he did it.Now, the imam initially said he didn't know him. We later learned a day later that the imam says I know him. It turns out I know him well but I knew him by his given Muslim name not Edward Archer.O'REILLY: All right. But why would the mayor of Philadelphia come out if a man said yes, I shot the officer, tried to kill him in the name of Islam, why would he come out and say this has nothing to do with Islam? Why would the mayor do that?STIGALL: I think first and foremost, Bill, if I could just be completely candid, it's obviously politics. Philadelphia is hosting the Democrats' convention coming up this summer. He's a brand newly-minted mayor. This is week number one in office. This is a guy who -- this is a subject I know very close to your heart -- made Philadelphia a sanctuary city on day one. His priorities are very leftist leaning agenda.O'REILLY: All right. So he's a left-wing guy but Chris, if he is this stupid it's shocking because he has to know the FBI is looking at this Archer's computer, just as they did out in San Bernardino. They are going to find out whether Archer had extensive contacts with jihadists, what he did. All that has not been released.So this mayor is putting himself out there going hey -- nothing to do with this. And then tomorrow or the next day the mayor can look like an idiot. He is not covering himself at all.STIGALL: Arguably he already does and that's why he has gone radio silent, Bill. I mean we haven't heard a word from him since that Friday press conference.O'REILLY: Ok. So you believe that the guy made a mistake and now he knows he made a mistake and he can get crushed.The only thing in the mayor's favor is that this guy Archer has a long rap sheet. He's a thug. There is a lot of gun-related stuff. Of course, the authorities in Pennsylvania didn't put him away as they should have. But he has got seven or eight things on his sheet. So, it's not like this guy just came out of the -- he was law abiding and then went over to ISIS. This is a criminal.STIGALL: That is true. I mean ironically this crime Bill happened on the eve, two hours, maybe, after the President's town hall on guns and now we find out Edward Archer had a stolen police gun that he used to fire on Officer Hartnett.But Beyond that important to note, he traveled -- made two different travels one to Saudi Arabia and then much longer trip to Egypt in both 2011 and 2012 where a number of people including some of his family members believed he became radicalized.O'REILLY: You know -- and this is going to be a real embarrassment for that mayor and the city of Philadelphia if the FBI comes out and says you know what this guy was plotting all kinds of stuff and he has contacts with ISIS.We will stay on the story and we appreciate it, Chris.

This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" September 23, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Breaking tonight, exactly 72 hours from now, the nation will witness a moment that could determine the presidency.  As Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton square off for the very first time in a debate that analysts suggest could be the biggest in history.  Welcome to ""The Kelly File"" everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly.  In 2012 some 67 million Americans watched Mitt Romney square off against Barack Obama. Monday night audience could so well past that.  Analysts suggest it could top 100 million viewers, no pressure Lester and become one of the most viewed political events in the history of television.  Holy Moly.  Both candidates are now deep in debate prep.  But Mr. Trump will hold a rally in Virginia tomorrow and we're also hearing that Hillary Clinton plans to head to Charlotte, North Carolina on Sunday where violent riots have raged over the police involved shooting of a black man there earlier this week.  We'll have more on that in a moment.  But first, to the main event.  The presidential debate.  Charles Krauthammer, Chris Stirewalt and Howie Kurtz are with me in a minute to discuss what's at stake.  Mark McKinnon, now The Circus is here with some behind the scenes look at the campaigns and debate prep.  And we're look at the latest numbers with Larry Sabato who has research on how the big showdown could move the polls.  But we begin tonight with campaign Carl Cameron reporting from Trump Tower in New York City.  Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks, Megyn.  Both candidates are intensively preparing for this debate.  They know that it has a great potential to be a decisive moment in the election.  And if there's a huge moment, it could virtually decide it, notwithstanding the two other presidential and vice presidential debates that follow it.  They are preparing quite differently.  Hillary Clinton has been working in mock debates with a sparring partner.  No one knows who that is.  It's very tight secret.  She's been working very hard to memorize a whole series of some of Trump's more colorful and what she considers to be objectionable comments.  Donald Trump is not working with a mock debate or a sparring partner.  He's got a steady stream of advisers working with him.  And he began his debate prep really right after the Republican National Convention when they began fairly regular Sunday afternoon meetings in New Jersey, with a team of debate advisors.  Most notably in it, Rudy Giuliani seems to have become a really important adviser in this process.  And one of the things that Trump has been told to do by all of his team is to focus on policy answers that are tight, that are aspirational, talking about what his goals and priorities will be but not to get bogged down too much in details.  If he can avoid any missteps, it has the opportunity to be a huge achievement for him since the expectations are low and because Hillary Clinton has been prepping so intensively.  Expectations for her are pretty high -- Megyn.   KELLY:  Carl, thank you.  Carl mentioned Rudy Giuliani and he's here shortly.  But right now, we want to bring in our panel.  Charles Krauthammer, a Fox News contributor and syndicated columnist.  Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor and Howie Kurtz, host of ""MediaBuzz"" on FNC. Great to see you all.  And so, when you see how these two are preparing to go against each other, it's like two silver back gorillas.  Yes.  They're there.  Studying each other and it's like a modern warfare situation where they're saying Trump is studying her body language and verbal tics getting ready to exploit weaknesses based on a statistical analysis of videos from 16 years' worth of Clinton's debates.  This is according to Politico.  They've identified her tells, words, phrases or gestures she uses when he's unsure of an answer or trying to deflect and he is ready to pounce if it happens.  Let me start with you on that, Charles.  Could be pretty effective.  CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think it's insane over preparation.  You stuff your head with that, you won't be able to speak. It's like, you know, the young rookie who goes up to the plate and has learned every idiosyncrasy of the picture to the point where his mind stops working.  And then some happy-go-lucky guy shows up who has been drinking all night and just acts on instinct.  Now Trump is the one who gets the reputation for being the happy-go-lucky guy who doesn't prepare and I think that's part of that is spin.  I mean, there is so much spin here.   KELLY:  He's preparing.   KRAUTHAMMER:  You know, you can really get the vertigo.  And there's a pre- debate spin of the post-debate stuff that's going to happen.  We're deep into that.  I'm not sure I believe anything coming out of anybody's camp. It's all going to be -- we're going to see what we're going to see and we'll do the spinning afterwards.   KELLY:  Uh-hm.  One of the things she needs to watch out for is what we saw from her this week, Stirewalt where for some reason she sometimes resorts to screaming her point and here is an example of that.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Now having said all this, why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask.  Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer.  I need your help to get Donald Trump's record out to everybody.  Nobody should be fooled.  (END VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  Yes.  I mean --  KELLY:  Nobody should be doing that.   STIREWALT:  I wonder why you're not 50 points ahead.  Golly gosh.  You sound like an enraged (INAUDIBLE).  I don't know why you're just not winning all of the points.  Hillary Clinton struggles when they tell her -- this is the terrible advice that Hillary Clinton gets over and over and over again.  Be yourself.  Be yourself.  No, no, not like that.  Not like that.  Not like -- no, exactly.  Be yourself and they say, actually we don't like it.  Be somebody else.  KELLY:  Right.  STIREWALT:  And the problem for her is, I don't know that she knows anymore who her real self is.   KELLY:  That person we saw at the Democratic National Convention worked for her.  STIREWALT:  Worked for her.  KELLY:  The screaming is a different story.  But, you know, obviously Howie, Trump has got a lot of weaknesses she can exploit as well, including, you know, the number of controversies he's created.  And we heard Carl Cameron report that she's studying his objectionable comments which, you know, it's going to take her from now until the next election but she's probably going to zero in, judging from the campaign ad she just released today on among other things, his comments about women.  Here's a flavor of what he just released.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I'd look her right in that fat ugly face of hers, she's a slob.  She ate like a pig.  A person who is flat chested is very hard to be a ten.  Does she have a good body?  No.  Does she have a fat (bleep), absolutely.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you treat women with respect?TRUMP:  I can't say that either.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Is this a president we want for or daughters, Howie?   HOWIE KURTZ, FOX NEWS HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"":  I don't think Hillary Clinton is going to bring up the flat chests remark.  And it sounds like the shrinks are in charges of this debate.   KELLY:  You don't think he's going to say to him?  This is a man who has referred to women as fat pigs and dogs and slobs?  KURTZ:  Oh, she may say a cleaned up version of that, sure.  Look, the pressure is on Trump for this reason.  He's the X factor, he is the reality show guy who wants to be put in charge of the nuclear codes.  And this whole campaign -- let's face it, has turned on his personality, and his temperament and his insults and he has to use these debates to magically pass the commander-in-chief threshold.  Now, Hillary Clinton is the boring but dependable bureaucrats, she's a government lifer, she's lived in the White House, she knows the -- back and forth.  The bar for her is to connect with voters who are either don't like her, tired of her, weary of her and also to deal with the honesty and trustworthy question that has dogged her throughout this campaign.   KELLY:  That's tough to do in a debate setting.  You know, that's more of a press conference situation you can sort of try to prove to people that you're honest report is coming.  Charles, what do you see as his biggest risk going into Monday night?KRAUTHAMMER:  Look, I think he's got the biggest opportunity because he's behind not by as much as he was, but he is behind.  So he needs to do well. On the other hand, he's got the low bar, an absurdly low bar and Hillary has done this.  Because she has reproduced the appalling stuff he's said in all of those ads.  She's portrayed him as a guy who can't be allowed near the White House so that all he has to do is to show up and not froth at the mouth and appear reasonably normal, charming would be a splendid bonus and he wins.  So it's been set up in a way, and I think he plays into it, where he doesn't have a lot that he has to do, simply has to control himself for 90 minutes.  Now with him, that could be a challenge.  But nonetheless, you know, for other folks, that generally is okay.  Ninety minutes, I'm sure Stirewalt or Howie can pull it off if they try.   KELLY:  Yes.  I don't know.  Just a five-minute segment on ""The Kelly File."" But I want to ask you this because Trump has gotten into trouble in the past for being too, I am the only one who can fix it, it's all about me, I will make  America great, I, I, I like an imperial presidency which conservatives believe we're just getting out of, right?  And this place into something that is getting some attention today online. It comes from a frontline documentary that is going to come out next week involving many people talking about Trump including one of the celebrity Apprentice, to the regular Apprentice contestants.  Omarosa.  Listen to this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OMAROSA MANIGAULT, THE APPRENTICE FORMER CONTESTANT:  Every critic, every retractor will have to bow down to President Trump.  It's everyone who ever doubted Donald, whoever disagreed, whoever challenged him.  It's the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  I don't know about that.  But your thoughts about how that narrative, that believe and that messaging from Trump himself about, it's me, it's all about me could endanger him on Monday.   STIREWALT:  We come together at a time of crises.  The country is at the abyss and only I can fix it.  These are dark days for America.  And you bet.  You're going to hear Trump, the law and order, our cities are burning.  America is at the edge, we're falling apart, we're being picked apart by our adversaries and that we need a strong man, emphasis on the man part probably, to take care of America at this dreadful hour.   KELLY:  Strength works for him.  Strength works but just too much imperialism maybe not.   STIREWALT:  Right.  And especially when Hillary Clinton sticks it up his nose.   KELLY:  Go ahead, Charles.   STIREWALT:  The flip side to painting the situation today as apocalyptic is to paint himself as messianic.  You remember in the acceptance speech he gave in Cleveland, he said, he didn't say I'm going to reduce crime and violence.  He said I'm going to abolish it.  Now nobody has done that going back to King Tut.  They've all tried it and I don't think any of them have ever promised to abolish crime and evil in the world.  He did it in a written state.   KELLY:  This is the kind of fact checking that the American people want to see on the spot from Lester Holt.  I hope he's watching this.   STIREWALT:  That is all of that psychiatric training.   KELLY:  Go ahead, Howie.   KURTZ:  Remember Trump has more TV experience than anybody who has ever run for president.  I don't think he'll be asking people to bow down.  It reminds me of Reagan in 1980, and that painted as a dangerous cowboy, needed to come out and won that election against Jimmy Carter by reassuring the country that he could handle the job.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.KURTZ:  I wouldn't underestimate Donald Trump's ability to adjust his debating style for this Monday's debate.  KELLY:  Before I let you go, I have to get this in real quickly, Ted Cruz today finally reversed himself and said, he's endorsing Donald Trump notwithstanding this expression of his feelings about Trump on May 3rd.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm going to tell you what I really think about him.  This man is a pathological liar.  The man cannot tell the truth but he combines it with being a narcissist. Everything in Donald's world is about Donald.  Morality does not exist for him.  Donald will betray his supporters on every issue.   (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Charles, thoughts on that.   KRAUTHAMMER:  Yes.  And that's why we need him in the White House.  (LAUGHTER)That's the sequitur that completes that argument.  (LAUGHTER)KELLY:  It's great to see all of you.  Looking forward to Monday night.  KURTZ:  Great to see you.   STIREWALT:  You bet.   KELLY:  Politicians are fun.  Well my next guest believes this may be the most important debate in U.S. history.  The campaigns have given him unprecedented access and here's a sneak peek from this week's episode of Showtime's ground breaking documentary series ""The Circus.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's nothing more exciting, more competitive or more unpredictable than a presidential campaign in the United States.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mayhem, madness, chaos.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you can't get excited to see how this thing is going to end, you should go to your doctor and get a physical.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is nothing like rehearsing report.  It's happened all throughout this year.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here we are sprinting, just a few weeks to go.  This is the closest an American women has ever been to the White House.   HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  When there are no ceilings, the sky is the limit.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The most important thing is confidence.  Trump is not lacking in that department.  Something is going to have to give here.   TRUMP:  We will make America great again.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We think the first debate will be the most watched television event in history and probably the single greatest driver of the outcome of this election.   (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me now, Mark McKinnon, co-creator and co-host of ""The Circus"" on Showtime.  He also served as chief media advisor to President Georg W. Bush.  Great to see you, Mark.  So it's --  MARK MCKINNON, ""THE CIRCUS"" CO-HOST:  I'm so excited about this debate.   KELLY:  I'm so excited about it too.  And why?  I mean, like we just saw in that clip, this is going to be like nothing we've ever seen before.  MCKINNON:  Well, because the stakes are so high and this has been such an epic race and been so unstable, we really don't know the outcome of this election.  I mean, every other election is pretty easy to predict what might happen.  We have no idea in this election.  We've been wrong so many times.  And I'd really think that given the stakes are so high, if somebody wins this debate, perceived to have won it, they will probably won the election.  The stakes are that high.   KELLY:  And the unpredictability of Trump is playing a huge role.  You know, he calls himself the ratings king.  He's right about that.  Trump rates on a normal night.  But on a night like this with somebody who is such an unpredictable television character, you tell me whether, you know, anything could happen.   MCKINNON:  Well, anything could happen.  And he knows that.  I mean he's the guy who understands television, understands drama.  So you can surely count on that he's going to bring out some surprises during the debate.  I think that he's got the easier task in this debate.  Number one obviously is the expectations game which is so low for him.  The other thing is that these two candidates both have problems.  His problem is that people perceive that he might have a temperament problem.  Her problem is that people see her as not being honest or trustworthy.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.MCKINNON:  He can fix that problem in a debate.  It's harder to fix hers in a debate.  So, all he has to do is really get through the debate without coming off the chain and it will go a long way toward people just looking at him saying, okay, I can see him as president.   KELLY:  So, as the guy who used to do this for a living, what would be your main message to him, keep your cool?MCKINNON:  Oh, yes, absolutely.  Keep your cool.  Because all he has to do is qualify.  What she has to do is disqualify.  And I assure you that she's going to use 90 minutes to prosecute him over and over and over again thinking that at some point he's going to unwind and come after her and that's when she knows she's got him.   KELLY:  Uh-hm.  And she's better have a glutens or something like that before she goes out there because there's no commercial breaks.   MCKINNON:  I think she's going to bring -- they're game players, both of them.  And I think that she's going to be very well-prepared obviously.  And she's done a lot of debates and he's done a lot of television.  So bring those two together, it's going to be spectacular.   KELLY:  We're going to be together, Mark.  I'll see you on Monday.   MCKINNON:  Kick it hard.  See you Monday.   KELLY:  Kick it.  Love that.   KELLY:  So, we've seen presidential debates produce big polling swings in four of the last five elections.  And Larry Sabato is next on what to watch for this time.   Plus, the city of Charlotte bracing for a fourth straight night of protests as we get some major new evidence in the death of Keith Scott, a video taken by his wife shows the moments before during and after the shooting. But who does this help?  And what we're now learning about Mr. Scott.  Rudy Giuliani is here along with Sheriff David Clark on what the new video shows and why some folks think they have spotted a game changer in one of the shots.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Breaking tonight, 46 days until the election.  Three days until the first debate and two national polls showing Hillary Clinton tracking slightly ahead of Donald Trump tonight.  First in Wednesday's ""Wall Street Journal"" poll, Mrs. Clinton is up by six points in a four-way race.  Then today from Marist, Mrs. Clinton again up by six points.  But based on some numbers we pulled from the last several debates, that could all change after Monday night.  Joining me now on that is the director of UVA's Center for Politics Larry Sabato.  Larry, good to see you.  So, just a word on the polling.  So did that show a trend in her favor or does that show a trend in Trump's favor. Another words, was she up more in those polls?  What are you seeing?LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UVA'S CENTER FOR POLITICS:  Well, look, I look at the polling averages, Megyn.  I'm a broken record on this because, you know, in this election if you don't like the polls, they kind of remind me of the British weather.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.SABATO:  If you don't like it, wait an hour and it will change.  And the same is true with the polls.  So, you got to go with the averages.  She's up about three or four.  As you note within things can change once people see the debates.  And, you know, I want to analyze it after I see it.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  Yes.  Because we're seeing just across the swing states a tightening, I mean, at least it appears.  Colorado they're tied right now. She was up by ten.  Michigan she's up by four.  She was up by 10.  New Hampshire, she's up by five, she was up by 9.3.  So, there's definitely been a tightening going into this debate and the question for you is, whether these debates will matter.  Because we go back to the first debate four years ago, Mitt Romney was wildly believed even by President Obama to have cleaned President Obama's clock.  What difference did it make?SABATO:  In the long run absolutely nothing.  And Megyn, you just hit on the critical point that people are ignoring in looking at the debates. What has happened with only one exception that I'll mention, but what has happened in some of these past debates, most of these past debates, they move the needle.  One, two, three, four points in somebody's direction and the debate effects dissipate within a week or ten days.   KELLY:  That's all they get?SABATO:  Basically, they get a week or ten days.  The exception was Ronald Reagan in 1980 but that's because the only debate was held a week ahead of the election.  KELLY:  All right.  SABATO:  There was a time for it to dissipate.  KELLY:  What is the challenge to Trump here?  Because we only saw him with four people.  Never seen him go, you know, one on one.  I don't think he's ever done a debate one on one and he had a much different dynamic in the primary process.   SABATO:  Yes.  In the primaries, he could hang back and let the other 16 candidates debate policy.  He didn't have to have a command of the facts about many of those policies.  He may be put on the spot by Hillary Clinton and the moderator.  I suspect it is going to happen.  It's 90 minutes.  So you have to know something to answer some of these questions.  We'll see how he does.  Obviously there are problems for both candidates over 90 minutes.  KELLY:  Well, exactly.  Because she's never faced somebody like Donald Trump, with all due respect, that Martin O'Malley.  I mean, this is going to be unlike anything she's ever experienced.  SABATO:  Yes, even Bernie Sanders.  I don't think Donald Trump is going to say, I'm tired of hearing about your damn e-mails.  KELLY:  I think you're right about that.   SABATO:  I suspect he's going to be adding a lot about her emails during the course of that debate.   KELLY:  It's incredible.  I know that you're calling for fact-checking by the moderators.  I have to say, she wants fact-checking of statements like this.  If Trump says, Clinton supports open borders, Clinton wants to get rid of the Second Amendment.  You tell me, that's absurd.  That's not the moderator's job to say no, her position on open borders is this.  That's an opinion, an argument a politician got to make on that stage.   SABATO:  Yes.  Essentially it's up to the other candidate to correct mistakes made by his or her opponent.  The moderator in my view should intervene mainly to ensure that both candidates are getting approximately equal time.  That's the moderator's job and also to stop candidates from interfering with one other's answers.  You can't have people talking over one another.  And I don't think most viewers like that.   KELLY:  Agreed.  Larry, great to see you.  SABATO:  Thank you, Megyn.  KELLY:  The audience can't say anything.  Because they've got to be very quiet.  We've got breaking news tonight out of Charlotte, North Carolina where protesters just shut down a part of a major highway running through the city.  And moments, we will go live to this unfolding scene as the march grows louder again tonight.  Plus, we'll show you the big controversy that came out today with the new video.  And what it shows in the moments after police shot Keith Scott in Charlotte.  Rudy Giuliani is here on how this case is unfolding before Sheriff David Clark gives us his take on what's really going on in Charlotte, next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Breaking tonight, we have seen a protest in Charlotte growing louder in the last 20 minutes as controversy grows over new evidence in the case of Keith Scott.  A video that was taken by Scott's wife and given to the media today shows the moments before, during and after her husband was shot.  Although the entire exchange is not seen.  You can hear police tell Scott to, quote, ""Drop the gun"" more than a dozen times before officers open fire.  You don't see the fatal shots but this is a disturbing piece of tape.  Watch.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him. He has no weapon. He has no weapon. Don't shoot him.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Drop your gun. Drop the (Bleep) gun.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him. He didn't do anything.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Drop the gun. Drop the gun. Drop the gun.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He doesn't have a gun. He has a TBI. He's not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Drop the gun. Let me get (Bleep) over here.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Keith, don't let them break the windows. Come on out of the car.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Drop the gun.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Keith, don't do it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Drop the gun.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Keith get out of the car.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Drop the gun.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Keith, Keith, don't you do it. Don't you do it. Keith! Keith! Keith, don't you do it.(Gunfire)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Bleep) Did you shoot him? Did you shoot him? Did you shoot him? He better not be (Bleep) dead. He better not be (Bleep) dead. I know that (Bleep) much. I know that much he better not be dead. I'm not going to come near you. I'm going to record you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Back up.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not coming near you. I'm going to record that he better be alive because -- you better be alive matter of fact. Yes, over here 9453 Lexington Court. The police officers just shot my husband and he better live.He better live because he didn't do nothing to them. Ain't nobody touch nobody. They're all good. I know he better live. I know he better live. How about that? I'm not coming to you guys but he better live. He better live. You all hear this and you see this, right? He better live.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Turn it off.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He better live. I swear he better live. Yep. He better live. He better (Bleep) live. He better live. Where is -- he better (Bleep) live and I can't even leave the damn -- I ain't going nowhere. I'm in the same damn spot. That's okay. Did you all call the police? I mean did you all call the ambulance?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: There are questions about what we saw and what we did not see in that video and we'll get to those in a moment. But we want to check in now with Steve Harrigan live in Charlotte tonight. Steve?STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, the crowd has been marching here for about an hour. For a brief moment, about ten minutes, they took control of the highway that rings this city, Highway 277. Last night, they were stopped from doing so by the police. Tonight, they were able to do that. We have not seen any damage to property, any arrests or any violence between police and demonstrators so far.For the second night in a row so far it's been peaceful. There was a real concern here that after that family's tape was released, that there would be greater numbers and possible violence. We are not seeing that. The crowd amounts to about 300 people, probably about 300 journalists as well. They've been chanting right now ""let my people go."" Earlier they were chanting ""show the tapes, release the tapes.""Real pressure here to get those tapes released from the police dashboard and body cams. That's what they're calling for here. The big numbers that were anticipated after that release of the shooting not panning out so far and so far another night peaceful so far in Charlotte. Megyn, back to you.KELLY: Steve, thank you. Back to Steve as news warrants (ph) tonight. Well with today's new evidence also come new questions as some folks suggest this videotape may disprove the police account of events. This is the image that was being circulated earlier this week. Showing what appears to be a handgun next to Keith Scott as he lay on the ground. You see it there? You can see Scott's shoes in white. Compare that now to the following image from the video released today by Mr. Scott's wife.The picture from the video seems to show Scott's feet without any firearm nearby. But ""The Kelly File"" did some digging and found this image that appears to show one of the responding officers having walked past what looks like a pistol on the ground. You can see it here in the red circle before noticing it behind him and then taking a step back and then apparently standing over that item on the ground. The timing on this scene is unclear and ""The Kelly File"" has reached out to the agency in possession of the police videos, which as you heard have yet to be released.One of the questions now is how and when did that weapon appear in that spot in the first place and why does this location in the videotape not appear to match the one in the still images we were originally shown earlier this week. Joining me now, Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke. Sheriff, good to see you. We're not going to do, you know, ""Forensic Files"" here on ""The Kelly File"" but I do want to ask you, you know, there's a conspiracy theory and it's going around and did the cops plant the gun?The man's -- Mr. Scott's fingerprints were reportedly found on it, his DNA, his blood. And on top of that, the police knew they were being filmed by the man's wife and there were several officers' right there. I mean, you tell me in your experience the likelihood of cops being so brazen as to plant a gun in those circumstances.DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF: Well, Megyn highly unlikely. I don't know all the facts though I don't know what happened here. I haven't seen all of the evidence. You know, that's one of the problems with releasing videotapes is it's one piece of evidence that you don't know how it fits in conjunction with all of the witness statements including the officers and other evidence that exists.I've investigated homicide. I've investigated police related shootings. I've supervised those scenes too. These are very complex and we have to wait to see the entire case, but I find it highly unlikely -- not impossible, highly unlikely that a gun was planted in that situation especially if the officers were wearing body cams. It would, you know, be kind of hard to do.KELLY: What jumped out at you in that tape because you know, those who are questioning the police behavior according to the fact that she kept saying he's doesn't have a gun, he's got a TBI, I mean, traumatic brain injury, and he just took his medication?CLARKE: Well, you know, that was her version of the events as she saw them unfold. But I heard some voices from what appeared to be police officers saying drop the gun. You know, we'll find out soon enough. Everybody wants this thing done, you know, within the half-hour that it happens on TV but if doesn't work that way so, I would caution everybody viewing tonight, don't rush to judgment and wait.I know these things are very emotional, they're very difficult to have to deal with at the time and everything that's going on in the good city of Charlotte, but reasonableness will have to prevail. Calm will have to prevail. Cooler heads and leadership will be important here until we get this thing sorted out.KELLY: Now, some are pushing to change the rules that police have to live by when they're out in the field. We heard Richard Fowler say on air (ph) just the other day, perhaps the policies need to be changed if all of these shootings are ""in policy."" There was a woman with an article on ""Huffington Post,"" Dr. GS Potter, described as an educator, and this person's argument is that first of all, policing is not a very dangerous job at all and in many ways officers have the right to kill without consequence and therefore we do need a change in the rules that govern police. Your thoughts.CLARKE: Well believe it or not, she has a Ph.D. which doesn't say much for people walking around with that title. Look, it's easy for her to say she's academic elite. She spends her time in the ivory tower of a classroom thinking she knows what's going on at ground level. She's at the 30,000 foot level and has very little experience or knowledge of what's really going on in the American ghetto.She may have heard about it, she may have passed through one a time or two but I always get a kick out of -- you know, policies, that the policies need to change, I don't have a problem with that after a discussion but you can't change them, you know, as we're going through here because she doesn't like the outcome.Like I said, there's a wall in Washington, D.C. with the names of 20,000 officers killed in the line of duty. I doubt that there's a memorial wall anywhere on with professors who have been killed in the line of indoctrination inside a classroom.KELLY: Sheriff, great to see you. Thanks for being here.CLARKE: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: As we watch these protests threatening to escalate again, American's mayor, Rudy Giuliani joins us next on what he thinks is the real problem here. And we'll ask him about Donald trump's debate prep, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: Breaking tonight, new protests on the streets of Charlotte just hours away from a midnight curfew for the second straight night. Earlier today the Clinton campaign announced that she would be traveling to Charlotte this weekend. And right before we came to air, Charlotte's Democratic mayor asked that no candidates visit that city in the middle of all of this. No update from the Clinton campaign.Mayor Rudy Giuliani took the helm of the Big Apple when it was considered the crime capital of the country and under eight years of his leadership, the violent crime rate dropped by 56 percent, helping make New York one of America's safest big cities. Mr. Mayor, it's great to see you tonight. So, you know, the amount of misinformation that gets put out there. What we heard from some people was that Mr. Scott was just holding a book, not a gun.We don't know whether there's a gun in that video. We hear cops saying over and over ""drop the gun, drop the gun."" I haven't heard anybody say he was holding a book. Even the wife isn't saying that's just a book. And then they were telling us that the cops shot that protester in the head the other night. Now we know today they have a man in custody. It was a career criminal who was on the street who shot him on the head according to the cops.RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Sure. This is happening because we don't have leadership in country. We don't have the president of the United States saying to people, wait, remain patient, situations like this take a couple of weeks at least, sometimes more than that to figure out the just result. Justice can't be accomplished except maybe back in the west in the 1830s on the street.KELLY: Right.GIULIANI: And this is why we have a criminal justice system. This is why we are a civilized country. Let's wait until all of the facts come in. I heard the African-American police commissioner or chief of Charlotte explain what seemed to be a rational reason for why this African-American police officer shot another African-American. Now, if he's right, then somebody's got to be concerned about the life of the African-American police officer as well.And all I hear is we're all concerned about the life of the guy who got shot. What about the guy who possibly almost got killed who was putting his life at risk to save us. Doesn't his life count for something? And shouldn't we at least calm down and wait and find out and...KELLY: What do you make of sort of anecdotal evidence, argument where people say, look, it may not have happened in this case but we're sick of black men winding up shot dead by cops in situations where they thought they had a gun, they didn't have a gun, the gun wasn't pointed at them, et cetera.GIULIANI: I'm very sympathetic to that and I think any police officer who shoots in an unjustifiable way like the person who got indicted in Tulsa the other day should be indicted.KELLY: You put a lot of cops in jail.GIULIANI: How about 70? And a couple when I was mayor. One for 25 years. Police officer who acts improperly and that's what the justice system determines should go to jail. But in most of the situations they're talking about, it turned out that the police officers were innocent. Let's take Baltimore for example and Freddie Gray. Hillary Clinton announced that they were guilty almost unequivocally before she had any facts. All five of them, charges dropped. Three of them were acquitted in a trial before an African-American Judge. And she is yet to apologize for that.It's that kind of rhetoric from Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that's produced the racial division that we have in America today. We didn't have this racial division nine years ago. This is much worse than we had nine years ago and I lay it right at the foot of our leadership of the kind of stuff that Barack Obama says, the kind of stuff that Hillary Clinton says, the fact that she wants to go to Charlotte...KELLY: Now, just getting this -- just getting this in my ear in the wake of the mayor saying that, she's now saying she won't go.GIULIANI: Well that's good. But her instincts were to go and politicize it.KELLY: I got to ask you, you're working with Donald trump on debate prep. I love to be able to see that. Are we going to have any surprises on Monday?GIULIANI: Of course we're going to have surprises.KELLY: Ooh, we are.GIULIANI: Of course we're going to have surprises.KELLY: Can you give us a hint?GIULIANI: Of course not. You think we're going to go and choose (ph) without a couple of surprises.KELLY: Is somebody playing Hillary Clinton?GIULIANI: No.KELLY: Is it you?GIULIANI: We prefer -- not that I haven't worn a dress before.KELLY: We haven't seen that.GIULIANI: However, Donald Trump has his way of preparing and he's doing it, he's doing it very, very well and he'll be well-prepared. Now, she's a, I mean, she's a career politician. She's debated a lot longer than he has in a lot more situation so I think he should expect that she would be really a terrific debater. And I think, I think as you know, Donald Trump always has at least one or two cards up his sleeve. So just watch out.KELLY: We will watch out. And we're looking forward to watching the whole thing Monday night. Great to see you, Mr. Mayor.GIULIANI: Thank you.KELLY: Always a pleasure. So, we're also hearing claims that police would not have opened fire like we saw there had it been a white man with a gun. Do you believe that? Dana Loesch and Richard Fowler take up that debate next when we come right back with another tense night in Charlotte.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight as we watch another tense night of marches in Charlotte, North Carolina, a new fight as erupted after Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson said that the police would not have opened fire in Charlotte, North Carolina had it been a white man with a gun, writing quote, ""In America, gun rights are only for white people.""Dana Loesch is the host of ""Dana"" on TheBlaze and the author of ""Hands Off My Gun,"" Richard Fowler is the nationally syndicated radio talk show host and senior fellow at the New Leaders Council. Richard, do you agree with Eugene?RICHARD FOWLER, RADIO HOST: I think Eugene wrote a very, very interesting piece and I think it's a piece that's thought provoking and I think it's actually something that me and Dana might agree on. While I don't agree with the Second Amendment, I believe that everybody should have access to it, and beyond that there should be due process. If you do have a gun in a state where there is some sort of carry law, the conceal carry or open carry, you should get your due process rights first.So, you have the Scott case which is still questionable, but in the Philando Castile case, where I think it's the most important case to look at this, he was indeed a gun owner. He had a license. And the police officer did not ask to see a conceal carry permit. He asked for his wallet. He thought he was reaching for a gun and he shot him.KELLY: That's the one where the man who was in the back of the car and his wife...FOWLER: No, no. He was in the front.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: And his girlfriend was streaming it live. It went out on Facebook live and started talking about it, OK.FOWLER: Correct.KELLY: Dana, you tell me because Eugene's argument is that open carry is legal in North Carolina. He had a gun, there's nothing illegal about that and just -- what did he do? He was sitting in a car with a gun.DANA LOESCH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Yeah. First, Megyn thanks for having me. I thought Eugene's piece is uninformed and silly. But I do agree with Richard and that I think that Second Amendment for law abiding Americans, that's something that I completely support the access thereof. Here's the deal, with Philando Castile, yes, he actually was by all accounts and by records that have been produced by local media, and he was in possession of a CHL. He has a concealed carry license.Here's the problem though, you're concealed to carry license means precisely squat when you are sitting in your vehicle and you are hearing from an officer to keep your hands where that officer can see them. Now, I'm still waiting for more information and I wish that the media would be and I wish that the law enforcement -- that the sheriff's department in this case would be more open about it, Megyn, because the last that I heard we were still kind of waiting to see exactly what happened when the officer approached the window and what Mr. Castile's hand were doing at that particular time.Megyn I have been stopped before and I'm a little white woman. I have been stopped before and I've had the officer ask me for my license and registration. I forgot one piece of paper and it was in my glove box and I was going to reach over and the officer, ""No, ma'am. You can't do that. Keep your hands where I can see them."" I'm not going to disobey an order. I'm going to keep my hands on the steering wheel.KELLY: What about that Richard, because you know, the gun defenders will say you see a cop ordering you to drop your gun and you have one option, which is drop it.FOWLER: Right. I hear that. I think it will be just tons and tons of cases where you see that, you know, there's Caucasian people who have guns and the officers ask them to drop them and they don't. But in the Philando Castile case in particular, which is what Dana was pertaining to, the officer asked him for his driver license and registration. According to his girlfriend, he says to the officer, I have -- they're in the glove box, I have a concealed carry permit.LOESCH: That's one incident.FOWLER: But the point is this.LOESCH: It is one incident.FOWELRE: But the point is this, and I think we (inaudible) and Dana can agree, that every gun owner should have due process to present their papers or present their concealed carry permit before being shot or before being threatened with violence...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: I mean, but if there's not time and you're given a direct order and you've got cops ordering you. I've got to leave it at that. I got to leave, my apology.LOESCH: Keith Scott is a prohibited possessor.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Don't forget to tune in this Sunday at 9:00 p.m. eastern for a special live edition of ""The Kelly File"" for a preview of the big showdown in Hofstra. Then on Monday night tune in for ""The Kelly File"" after the debate, 11:00 p.m. For wrap-up and analysis. See you then.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Journal Editorial Report,"" October 24, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, FOX NEWS HOST:  This week on the ""Journal Editorial Report,"" fireworks on Capitol Hill as Hillary Clinton faces questions about the Benghazi terror attack.  But with Joe Biden out of the race, is her lock on the Democratic nomination already security or are there other obstacles ahead.Plus, with a third Republican debate days away, Ben Carson knocks Donald Trump from the top spot in a key early state.  Is he the outsider to watch or does Trump have staying power?  Find out after these headlines.(FOX NEWS REPORT)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE & FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE:   I would imagine I've thought more about what happened than all of you put together.  I've lost more sleep than all of you put together.  I have been racking my brain about what more could have been done or should have been done.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Welcome to the ""Journal Editorial Report.""  I'm Paul Gigot.  That was Hillary Clinton this week in her much-anticipated testimony before the House committee investigating the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya.  The former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate faced 11 hours of questioning Thursday.  So, did we learn anything new?  Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; foreign affairs columnist, Bret Stephens; and Washington columnist, Kim Strassel.  Kim, you followed the whole hearing.  What did we learn?  What's the most important thing we learned?  KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  The most important thing we learned that this line the White House put out immediately following the attack that it was inspired by this anti-Muslim video, what we learned is they knew all along that was not true.  We know this because of e-mails that were revealed at the hearing.  Remember, their argument going into an election was that --GIGOT:  Right.STRASSEL:  -- that Obama had killed bin Laden, al Qaeda was on the run, the economy was reviving.  They did not want anything to mess with that line.  But we now have e-mails that were released that show that on the night of the attack Hillary Clinton sent an e-mail to her daughter, Chelsea, saying, ""I can't talk right now because two of our officers in Benghazi have been killed by an al Qaeda-like organization.""  The next day, in a conversation she had with the Egyptian prime minister, she outright told him, we know this was not caused by a video.  This was a planned attack.  It was not the result of a protest.  GIGOT:  Dan, is this going to be significant because what that shows is that the -- politically significant. because what that shows is the private story that she was telling people was different than the public story that the administration and secretary of state were communicating?  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR:  I think it's going to be significant next year.  Let's just set aside the incompetence of the State Department in protecting its diplomats overseas, which is not what anyone is interested in here.  It's how the politics plays for Hillary Clinton.  Look, the private version is like the private e-mail servers, it's a question of her judgment.  She displayed bad judgment in selecting per personal, political needs over the needs of the American people at that point.  Come next September and October, TV commercials are going to be cut, saying, A, B and this is about Hillary Clinton's credibility and her judgment, which is her biggest vulnerability right now.  BRET STEPHENS, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST:  Can I disagree for --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  The conventional wisdom, Bret, is the opposite of what Dan says that this is going -- she is a triumph and she rolled over the Republicans.  STEPHENS:  I agree with that.  Look, think was Nixon/Kennedy debate.  Famously Nixon was said to have won the debate by those listening but Kennedy won the debate --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  You didn't see that?  STEPHENS:  Well, I've seen it on --GIGOT:  I did, as a matter of fact.  (LAUGHTER)STEPHENS:  It's similar.  If you're sort of thinking of these hearings of what they yielded, the point Kim just made, basically we just caught the administration in a gigantic lie, is true.  But what Americans watching this saga saw was a woman sitting there confidently, patiently, with all the right pained expressions, sitting in front of what looked like a bunch of munchkins trying to go after her.  GIGOT:  But what about Dan's point this is going to show up next year because you'll see the sound bites --(CROSSTALK)STEPHENS:  And the Democrats are going to say these are desperate attacks and they're old news.  (CROSSTALK)STEPHENS:  And that's what -- and that's going to work.  And it is unfortunate for those who were interested in actually getting at what happened in Benghazi that we had to have this -- the show that we had this week.  GIGOT:  But aren't they about -- go to question of political care and judgment.  If she was, as secretary of state, her first instinct was, I'm going to protect -- preserve the narrative the administration wants so we can win re-election as opposed to my first instinct being, oh, my gosh, let's tell the truth about what happened with the deaths of American people-- American servicemen and diplomats.  Isn't that a question that people will want to hear about?  STEPHENS:  Yes, that's an important question.  The problem is we gave her an opportunity to turn an important political and historical question into a matter of basically political campaign --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  So, we shouldn't have had her on -- they should not have had her --(CROSSTALK)STEPHENS:  We should have had this information in some way other than this 11-hour marathon hearing.  GIGOT:  Dan, you --(CROSSTALK)HENNINGER:  I think this performance could have been duplicated by 100 skilled bureaucrats in the federal government.  This is what they do.  Assemble a lot of data and facts and statements in a fog of irresponsibility, which is what she did.  GIGOT:  So, I think it's going to come back and be an issue?  HENNINGER:  Oh, yeah, I think it will be an issue.  GIGOT:  Kim, adjudicate this fight between Stephens and Henninger.  (LAUGHTER)What do you think?STRASSEL:  I'm with Dan.  People are not going to remember this performance so much as the evidence that came out of it.  And the evidence goes, as you said, one, to her character and her judgment.  Those are going to be some of her biggest vulnerabilities in this race going forward.  That, and the question whether the FBI makes a move on any of this going forward as well.  GIGOT:  On the e-mails.  We'll get to that.  Anything else, Kim, that you learned at the hearing that you thought was significant?  STRASSEL:  Well, this -- again, it goes to the judgment question.  There was a lot of discussion about why we were in Libya, and Mrs. Clinton's role in pushing us to be there and as a result, her interests in making sure this was a good news story, regardless of what was really happening on the ground.  And we heard a lot, took, about who was advising her, Sidney Blumenthal, an old Clinton crony, rather than respected and knowledgeable people within the State Department.  She put a lot of interest and emphasis on his judgment, which, again, goes to her own judgment.  GIGOT:  That's scary when you think about Sid Blumenthal in the Oval Office.  When we come back, with Joe Biden out of the picture, is the path to the nomination now clear for Hillary Clinton or are there still hurdles ahead?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Ending months of speculation, Vice President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that he will not enter the Democratic presidential race, leaving Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders as the only remaining challenger to Hillary Clinton to be polling in the double digits.  So is the path to the nomination now clear for Clinton or are there other obstacles ahead?  Dan, so Lincoln Chafee gets out this week, so Joe Biden gets out this week, Jim Webb gets out this week.  There will be nobody on stage except Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley and Hillary Clinton is they have another debate.  This is the least competitive open presidential nomination in modern history.  HENNINGER:  Paul, I've got to give you my favorite headline from the past week on this subject, which was, ""How Bernie Sanders plans to explain Democratic Socialism.""  (LAUGHTER)Serious.  He's going to give a speech explaining what Democratic Socialism means.  GIGOT:  Is that going to carry him over the top?  HENNINGER:  No.  It means it's hopeless.  It means it's probably hopeless.  (LAUGHTER)I think there's another point here to make.  Bernie's support among young Democrats is pretty strong, especially among young women.  I think there's a problem here for the Democratic Party.  It suggests that younger Democrats are drifting away from standard liberalism towards the left and maybe even towards Socialism.  And I think the regular candidates like Hillary have to be acutely aware of that.  She has to appeal to that segment somehow.  GIGOT:  She is.  She is.HENNINGER:  Which is out of the mainstream of the American electorate.GIGOT:  She is running to the left of Barack Obama on all kinds of issues.  HENNINGER:  Yeah.  So his presence is there, no matter what.  GIGOT:  Any other obstacles, Bret, to her nomination?STEPHENS:  The most obvious obstacle is an FBI investigation of her e- mails.  That investigation is run by -- ultimately, by Jim Comey, and also run by the Justice Department --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Jim Comey being the FBI director.  STEPHENS:  The FBI director, Loretta Lynch, so, I think the chances of this investigation yielding anything, any real trouble for Hillary Clinton are fairly slim.  Comey is a very political director masquerading as a straight shooter.  GIGOT:  But if the FBI holds Hillary Clinton to the same standard it held Petraeus and Deutsch and others in mishandling classified information, it seems to me she should at least have to cop to a misdemeanor.  She had clear intent to evade Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Records Act, and she knew that classified information was very likely to come across that server.  That's mishandling classified information.  Why wouldn't the FBI act on that?  (LAUGHTER)STEPHENS:  As I said, Jim Comey is a very political director.  GIGOT:  Wow.  OK, Bret.STEPHENS:  This is the future -- they believe the future president of the United States.  So, she's being held to an entirely different standard from General -- or Director Petraeus, Director Deutsch, and so on.  It's simple politics.  It's the corruption of a system.  GIGOT:  Kim, does this mean the Democratic party, with Hillary Clinton clearly the leading candidate, are they all going to marshal forces around her and she'll be able to march to the nomination with ease?  STRASSEL:  Dan's point is actually really important in that Bernie Sanders is not going to win this nomination, but he is going to pull her left.  And one outstanding question is whether or not she can go left enough to satisfy what is a significant portion of Democrats out there who clearly are not energized or thrilled by Hillary Clinton.  She's also got a tough line she's going to have to walk in that she's got to figure out very carefully how she walks the line between embracing the Obama presidency and not upsetting those voters that still very much are fond of this president, while also suggesting that she would govern differently and she has different policies in some way, to satisfy those who are but to satisfy with his economy and his leadership.  HENNINGER:  To Kim's point about Obama's -- Obama's presidency, one interesting thing that to me came out of that Benghazi hearing was, in her opening statement, in which she started talking about working towards a more bipartisan foreign policy and how we had to work with Congress, clearly trying to separate herself from Obama, who had basically gone alone on foreign policy, and I think that she was making a pitch that was showing us what she's going to be saying on the campaign trail.  STEPHENS:  I agree.  I actually disagree with Kim.  I think this is an opportunity, because she's clearly going to win the nomination, barring something from the FBI, for her to attack right back to the center because she knows, from now on, she's fighting a general election and she'll have to fight for more than just the Bernie Sanders voter.  She has to fight for centrist Democrats and Independent voters.  On the other hand, because she once again has a coronation, she'll be making a lot of mistakes.  GIGOT:  All right.Well, when we come back, with just days to go until the next Republican debate, Ben Carson knocks Donald Trump from the top spot in Iowa and gains ground with a key voting group.  Could it spell trouble for Trump in the months ahead?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  As the Republican presidential candidates prepared to square off in Boulder, Colorado, in their third debate, a look now at the state of the Republican race.  The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC poll shows Trump maintaining his lead nationwide, but Ben Carson close behind, within the margin of error, heading into Wednesday night's showdown.  And thanks in large part to his support among women, a new Quinnipiac University survey finds Carson surging past Trump for the first time in the crucial early state of Iowa.  So, Bret, what do you make of Ben Carson's rise in the polls, especially Iowa?  STEPHENS:  Partly, it's a matter of Donald Trump exhaustion.  I think he made one comment too many with the 9/11 comment.GIGOT:  Really?STEPHENS:  But it's somehow the accumulation --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  And the attack on George Bush for 9/11?  STEPHENS:  Exactly.  Ben Carson has a sterling obviously extraordinary reputation as a doctor.  He's the quiet man.  He comes across as the anti- Trump.  But what's really happening here is Republican voters are sampling the outside candidates.  That's why you saw Carly rise so sharply when she did well in her debates.  She's now deflating a bit.  Now they're looking at Carson.  I think as they take a closer look at Carson, a lot of Republican voters are going to be alarmed and worried that he's not going to perform well in debates against Hillary because his political knowledge looks pretty shallow.  GIGOT:  So he's extraordinarily likable in the polls.  And they all show that 80 percent favorable rating.  That doesn't happen, Dan, to politicians.  Maybe because people don't think he is a politician.  That's got to go down as he campaigns.  But it is extraordinary.  HENNINGER:  Yeah, it is.  On the other hand, there's Trump, whose support among women in the recent Quinnipiac poll in Iowa is 13 percent, but he goes, ""Women love me.""  (LAUGHTER)Well, not so much in Iowa, right?  30 percent say they could never vote for him in Iowa.  I think Trump has reached a ceiling.  Ben Carson hasn't reached a ceiling.  GIGOT:  So, Kim, you weren't up this week but we saw -- Rick Santorum came into the office and talked about the race and his race in Iowa and said that he thinks Carson and Trump, a lot of voters don't know what their positions are on the issues, particularly in Iowa, and as that becomes more vetted as the weeks go on, you're going to see some Republicans say, mm, I wonder if these guys are really who should be the Republican standard bearer.  What do you think of that analysis?  STRASSEL:  There's something to that.  They probably won't be voting for Rick Santorum.  However, this is very much following what happens in past elections.  There is a big interest, especially in these early voting states, in outside candidates.  They start to tune in after the summer is over.  And they begin to understand the positions.  Then, they move and gravitate toward other more established candidates.  One of the things that you're seeing, for instance, in Iowa, is the rise of Marco Rubio, who is hardly an outsider to politics.  He's been in politics his whole life.  He does come across --GIGOT:  I think he has 13 percent in that Quinnipiac poll.STRASSEL:  Right, which puts him up way ahead of Jeb Bush, for instance, other people that are in the race.  But the point being is that what is attracting people to him more and more is that he looks like someone who knows his stuff when it comes to foreign policy.  He's got a plan on a lot of domestic issues.  In the end, that's probably going to end up trumping the outsider status that right now holds sway.  GIGOT:  I'm going to probably disappoint a few people and agree with Bret - -(LAUGHTER)-- on Carson's appeal to -- the challenge he faces, which is people like him very much.  They admire his career.  But they're going to have to sit down over time and say, can I see this man in the Oval Office?  He's going to have to demonstrate real knowledge of the issues.  It's not as if he's not smart enough to do it.  He obviously is.  But because of what he's been doing with his life, he hasn't been studying issues like Russia and the Middle East, you know, a lot of economics.  And yet, those are the biggest questions that a president faces.  You have a guy like Rubio who's been on the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Intelligence Committee, and so he's dealt with that for years.  Carson hasn't.  Is that, in your view, a big challenge for him?  HENNINGER:  I think it is a big challenge, Paul, and he'll have to somehow maintain himself as we get closer to Iowa and New Hampshire.  I know people hate process, but we're only at the first stage.  Eventually, the candidates like Rubio and Bush are going to start dropping for TV advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire.  That stuff makes a difference.  Once they start pouring it into those states, somehow, we'll see if Trump spends money on it and Ben Carson is going to have to react to it.  GIGOT:  Though attacking Ben Carson in a negative ad is dicey.  HENNINGER:  They'll elevate themselves.  They're not going to Ben Carson --(CROSSTALK)STEPHEN:  No, look, I think a lot of voters will say, you know, obviously, he's a really smart guy but the kind of smarts that makes you a great surgeon isn't necessarily what you need in the Oval Office.  I think that is going to show.  In politics, you get thrown questions all the time that you're barely prepared for.  You're going to deliver half-baked answers, and they're going to come back and haunt you.  GIGOT:  What if, looking at Hillary Clinton, they say, you know what, let's elect an honest man.  (LAUGHTER)STEPHENS:  I wish the election in 1940 with Wendell Willkie had gone the other way, but it didn't.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  So the outsider is a really tough road to go to the White House.  I'm afraid you're right.  But let's watch.  This could be the year.  We have to take one more break.  When we come back, our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Time now for our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.  Kim, start us off.  STRASSEL:  A hit to Paul Ryan for stepping up to run for speaker.  Let's be clear, Mr. Ryan did not have to do this.  He didn't even want to do this.  He was very happy as Ways and Means chairman.  And this is a pretty thankless job, being speaker.  But it became clear he was probably the only person who could do it.  He's a principled conservative.  He's got a lot of respect among the members.  He's got a vision for the country.  Mr. Ryan, very shrewdly, made some demands of his caucus, namely that they all back him.  We're about to find out if that caucus understands the opportunity that they've been given to finally make some progress in the House.  GIGOT:  All right, Kim, thanks.Bret?  STEPHENS:  I'd like to pay tribute to Master Sergeant Joshua Wheeler who was killed in Iraq in a very daring rescue operation of 70 Kurds who were about to be executed by ISIS in northern Iraq.  It's a reminder that we have 3,500 troops in Iraq.  They seem to be a forgotten force.  But they're putting themselves in harm's way and they're saving human lives and we ought to be mindful of that sacrifice.  And we ought to be mindful of what the stakes are.  So I just want people to be mindful of Master Sergeant Wheeler.  GIGOT:  Hear, hear, Bret.  Dan?  HENNINGER:  Well, on a lighter note, last weekend, on ""Saturday Night Live,"" Comedian Larry David did a perfect imitation of presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders.  Then a couple of days later, on Jimmy Kimmel, presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, did a perfect imitation of Larry David.  Two weeks ago, Hillary Clinton was on SNL with the woman who portrays her as a comedian on SNL.  I'm getting a little bit confused here.  Who are the comedians and who are the presidential candidates?  But maybe at this point, what difference does it make?  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  Well, Sanders and Larry David, they're both cranky.  (LAUGHTER)They're perfect personalities.  And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us JER on FNC.  That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Jedediah Bila, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""They stood in front of the cameras and told the American people they would support the nominee no matter who it was going to be.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'll be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party.GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm a Republican, George. Whoever the nominee is I'm going to get behind him. Plain and simple.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I pledged at the outset, I will support the Republican nominee, whoever it is.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You will support the nominee of the party?TRUMP: Yes. I will.KASICH: I will support whoever is the Republican nominee for president.CRUZ: I promise I would support the Republican nominee. And I am someone who keeps his word.(END VIDEO CLIPS)PERINO: But now after wars over wives, so-called lies, and just about everything else this campaign season, all three Republicans left in the race are somewhat backing away from that promises.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: No.ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: You don't?TRUMP: No. We'll see who it is.COOPER: The pledge you took is no longer void.(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Whoever the Republican nominee is, you say you will no longer guarantee.TRUMP: I have been treated very unfairly.CRUZ: I'm not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks my wife and attacks my family. I think that is going beyond the line. I think our wives, I think our kids should be off-limits. They don't belong in the attacks.KASICH: If the nominee is someone that I think is really hurting the country and dividing the country, I can't stand behind them.(END VIDEO CLIPS)PERINO: All right. So what a difference just a few months makes. Jedediah, there is no doubt this campaign has been a turbulent one.JEDEDIAH BILA, GUEST CO-HOST: Yes.PERINO: To say the least. Emotions riding high. All three candidates actually believe or say that they will be the nominee.BILA: Yeah.PERINO: They plan to be the nominee. So the question is a little difficult for them to answer at this point.BILA: I mean, I would have never made this pledge. I thought it was kind of ridiculous, only because you will never know what will come up with a candidate. You can unearth anything. Look at what Donald Trump has done. You may have supported him in the beginning. Maybe a lot of people now are saying well, I don't agree with what he is doing now, or Ted Cruz for that matter. You'll never know what's going to come up. So I always say the answer to that is I have allegiance to my principles. I don't have allegiance to a party or a person, who I can't be responsible for what they may or may not say. The problem here is they look like a bunch of liars now. So everyone sitting there is saying well, you said you would support the person no matter who it was. And now, all of a sudden, there's a but clause at the end of it. So politicians, these are smart people. Ted Cruz is a smart guy. They should think ahead of time and just say, you know what, let me think how I'll answer this question. Because if I say yes, absolutely and then say oh, but, I will look like a liar.PERINO: There is a practical point. It is one thing, Juan, to have to raise your hand in front of international television or live on TV, to say you will support the nominee. But it is another when you talk with the RNC and you have to sign -- I don't know if the DNC does the same, but the Republican National Committee, since 2012, all of those candidates signed a pledge saying that they would support the nominee or they're working for the party. Because in exchange, that's how you get access to the data and information that the RNC has. I don't know, but does the Democrats do the same?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Something similar. In fact, Bernie Sanders got in trouble earlier because he had access to data. That thing was leaked. But I might say what strikes me here is their grievances, Jedediah. They have grievances. So they could argue that things have changed. Donald Trump makes the case that he has been treated unfairly by the RNC.PERINO: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Right? Ted Cruz says Donald Trump said nasty things about my wife. I'm not sure what John Kasich's complaint is.(CROSSTALK)BILA: That he's not winning.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: But in the case of Trump and Cruz, I could say well, maybe things changed a little bit, Jedediah.BILA: Yeah.WILLIAMS: I wouldn't say they are liars. I would say that they backed away from the pledge. I mean, it is very clear now you have a fractured party. There is no question.PERINO: Well, there is a real question, Eric, for Republican voters now that you see it in the polls. People saying maybe a traditional GOP voter and you're thinking I don't know if I can vote for him or you're a reenergized Republican voter or a new voter to the party and saying I can't wait to vote for this guy for president. But no matter other becomes the RNC nominee -- sorry, the GOP nominee, they're going to need every Republican vote that they can get. So trying to consolidate at this point would make sense. I don't know if they'll do it.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: So this whole pledge came about because the theory was that they were afraid Donald Trump was not going to be the nominee. But the spoiler by running a third party, diluting the Republican vote, and have Hillary Clinton walk in. So they decided it would be Jeb or Rubio. No one saw the Trump nomination. Now everyone is saying wow, I'm not sure I can handle this, Trump's grievances that he doesn't feel he is being treated. But then when you hear all the horse trading and all these rules are rules, 1237, but then maybe rules can be changed at the convention. You made a mistake by saying RNC nominee. But that was actually right. It is not a GOP nominee. It is an RNC nominee. And they will tell you -- the RNC will tell you there are two RNC delegates who said the misconception is that the voters had a say who the nominee is. No. The RNC delegates are the ones who have the say in the nominee. And that's really was the distaste. That's where a lot of the distaste is coming from.PERINO: But is anybody saying, if they don't get to 1237, they won't get the nominee?BOLLING: That's what these meetings were all about, if they can change. And in fact, they can change the rules at the convention. They can.(CROSSTALK)BILA: What about if he doesn't get appropriate number, the 1237? Then you know that's.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And the characterization. We've had that discussion three times now. So we'll move on. And ask Greg for your opinion on the pledge.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well, it's funny. Because you know The Five -- what we're doing is we're pointing out this fractured strife among the Republican Party. But us pointing that out is like Charlie Sheen pointing out the drug habit. We as a show are facing internal strife. From a microlevel to a macrolevel, you can look at conservative websites like Breitbart, how much that has fallen apart since the Trump nomination. You can look at The Five on any given day. We have tension over this nomination, over this candidate. You can look at our network as a whole, which is -- don't look at me.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: We are having networks issues within the family of anchors over this stuff. You can look at the party. So in every area where there is conservatism, there is strife. And I just remember the good old days where we could unite against the hatred for Obama.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: It will be back.GUTFELD: It will be back. But somehow Trump has shattered that. And now, we're sitting here. We are grappling (ph) with this internal strife. And we have no way to get out of this. So when we're talking about the convention, or when we're talking about how do we improve this, we actually have to talk amongst ourselves as conservatives, as Republicans. Can we express our grievances honestly about how we feel about this so we can move beyond? So we can unite. I'm not talking like an encounter group, but I'm saying we all have to be honest with each other. Instead of saying you're stupid for supporting Trump.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: You're hitting on -- I think this is the most unique time in the history of American politics. You're hitting on it exactly. We've gone from I don't like that candidate, I don't like what he represents, I'm not going to vote for him. Here's why. To If you like him, you're an idiot, you're a jerk, you're I don't know helping him become the nominee. And people are so angry. Everything becomes personal.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: It's never been this personal before. At least not in my history.GUTFELD: I agree. I have friends who I won't mention, Robert Davi, who texts me in caps every day angry over something that I might say about Trump. It is this weird thing where he says why do you hate Trump. I go like I don't hate Trump. It is not hate. I don't think it is his fault. I don't think he even knew this was going to happen. You know, I thought he was doing it as a protest vote. And then it just happened. And so we are all sitting here. And I agree with you, Eric. I think that everybody is mad at each other over this. And unless people can get beyond this, it will end up like Breitbart.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Can you imagine what this convention will be like?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It hasn't been completely and definitely.GUTFELD: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It will be ugly. And people have to put away I guess their emotions and they have to function on reason.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Reason and logic have not really been part of the conversation. I mean, you bring up a fact then you are also called every name in the book by their supporters.BILA: There's candidate worship though. If I say something critical of Ted. I criticize everyone. I don't have a dog in this fight. If I criticize Ted Cruz, then all the Ted Cruz people on Twitter rush at me. That's candidate worship. If I criticize Donald Trump, you get the candidate worship from the Trump folks. And I will just remind everyone what you didn't like about President Obama. What's the candidate worship that went along with him, that no matter what he did, his backers came out to defend him? But if he did something wrong, or he was hypocritical, there was this notion that he was bigger. Remember, we were pointing out the ridiculousness of the columns when he campaigned. That he was larger than life. And larger than the fact that he works for us, not the other way around. These are just people. They're just men. And they're flawed and we're here to criticize them. And I think a lot of folks on the right have forgotten how to do that with a civility and the decency that they often criticize the left for not having.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I just want to come back to this. One, I thought what you said was terrific. That's the most honest discussion I've heard of this anywhere. And the fact is you know, there is tension all over about this. I will say this. I think that two things. One is, it is personal. It is very personal.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: If I start making fun of Eric's wife, you better believe Eric would take it personally, right?GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: He would say dude, back off.PERINO: You might be sitting on 48th street.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: So I think it is very personal.BOLLING: By her.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: So it has become intensely personal. And I think that's why you see them saying, I'm not going to back this guy. And the second thing is, when you ask voters in polls, you know, it is not like they say, he is my second choice. He's my third choice. They say no way Jose. I'll never vote for the other guy.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Obviously, you want to build a wall around Jose.WILLIAMS: Thank you. Juan prefers Jose.GUTFELD: The thing with Cruz about being upset about what Trump did with this retweet. I think to me, I don't buy it. Because he was OK with it with other people. He said Trump was terrific. Remember that tweet?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Carly Fiorina in that debate after he said she was ugly.BOLLING: He was OK with a lot of stuff.PERINO: I'm not disagreeing with that.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Women and their looks, and attacking them for their looks. He did stick up for Carly in that regard.BOLLING: But see them slag it out, no matter what level they choose it, whether low level that is going on, low level rhetoric, gutter rhetoric that's going on, or a higher level, more sophisticated debate is one thing. But when the fans, the people, the supporters start slugging it out with each other makes no sense. And you're right. That's where we are. Everyone in the stands are fighting while they're on the playing field as well. It's crazy.WILLIAMS: It is personal crazy.GUTFELD: If you were critical of -- it is like a team sport. I liken Trump to the Oakland Raiders. I loved the Oakland Raiders in the '70s. Because of not how they won, but how they played.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I hated them.GUTFELD: I loved them. You had Ted Hendricks. These were greedy people. If you said you didn't like the Oakland Raiders, the Oakland Raider fan would take it personally. And if you say that to any team. And I think that what happens when you say you don't like Ted Cruz, the Cruz fans take it personally. The Trump fans, they get pissed. They come after you. It is now you have to find a way to criticize somebody in a way that isn't personal or isn't perceived as personal. I don't know if it is possible.WILLIAMS: I don't think it is possible at this point.PERINO: We got to run.WILLIAMS: I will make one last thing.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: That's all right. But I will make one last point, which is to say the Republican brand, when you have Trump saying some of these things and then Cruz going back and Jedediah saying you guys are a liar, I think it hurts.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: All right. Donald Trump, he defends his campaign manager that was charged with battery yesterday. And while his opponents are calling him to fire his aide, Trump says he is the actual victim. That's next on The Five.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: His campaign manager has been charged with battery, but Donald Trump is standing by Corey Lewandowski and discrediting former Breitbart reporter who filed a case against him. Last night, he kicked off a town hall appearance with a dramatic reading of Michelle Fields' claim.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: In hen own words exactly, I was jolted backwards. She was not -- I mean, she's standing there. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm. Tightly. And yanked me down. She was not yanked down. She didn't have any expression. I almost fell to the ground. She didn't almost fall to the ground. By the way, she was grabbing me. Am I supposed to press charges against her? So my arm is just killing me.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: He says the tape of the incident proves his aide's innocence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: And I'm very glad that we were able to produce the tape. Because I don't see anything. I see virtually nothing. And we're going to destroy a man's life over this?If you saw on the tape something different, would you have fired Corey? If he threw her to the ground, I would have fired him immediately. Absolutely.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Trump's opponents have all weighed in.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: It shouldn't be complicated that the members of the campaign staff should not be physically assaulting the press. I mean, that should not be a complicated decision.KASICH: You want to give people the benefit of the doubt. When you see things that are pretty clear, from what I understand, the video is clear. Of course, I would fire him.HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think there have been a lot of rhetoric as well as behavior coming from Donald Trump's campaign that is concerning to many people including many women.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Dana, I'm going to ask you again. Given your experience in politics, dealing with difficult crisis situations...PERINO: I never dealt with anything like this.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: The entire financial crisis.WILLIAMS: No, no, no.(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Well, what do you think?PERINO: Here is the thing. The police disagree with Donald Trump. OK. And there is going to be a court date. So there is that. The decision to further mock her and to smear her more than she already had been, I think is a fool hardy one. If you are already doing badly with women in general for the general election and increasingly worse with Republican women, according to the polls, then you would think that you might want to say, you could have apologized initially. But the further mocking I think is a question. We just talked about this. The A block was so beautiful. Let's not take things personally. This is actually taking it from a presidential level to taking on one young woman when they could have actually -- they could have handled it very differently. But once they decide to go after somebody, they keep going. Like the reporter -- the disabled reporter that they made fun of. They said oh, no, we didn't. Then it was proven that he did. And if it is constantly going after people who they think are weaker than them and trying to destroy them. I don't like it.WILLIAMS: But the other side of the story, Eric, is Trump says I'm being loyal to a top aide. Are you going to destroy a man's life over this?BOLLING: So I think right before we came to air, I think Florida prosecutors office said they don't even have the case yet. And so right now, the police have charged Corey Lewandowski. Florida may not actually go ahead and prosecute the case. The jury is out on that. If you look at the tape, we heard both sides of the story for literally weeks. I think this happened March 8th. For weeks, we have heard both sides. If you look at the tape, it looks like neither side is completely accurate. It looks like Corey may have -- I don't know for a fact but may have touch Michelle Fields. On Michelle's side, she said she almost fell down, almost dragged down to the ground. It doesn't look like that to me. It is just an observation. I could be wrong. So the question is what is the legal and political fallout of it? Legally, I think everyone is hanging their head on Corey saying he didn't touch her after the fact. I'm not sure that will play in the case, it may or it may not. Legally, that is for the prosecutors office. I would be surprised.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: The politics are vastly bigger. What do you think?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I think the candidates who are not Donald Trump are smart to go after and play up big, as Dana's point out, the women's vote. He is doing very well with women in the GOP race. He is number one. He is beating Cruz and Kasich. In a general election, not so much.WILLIAMS: Not so much.BOLLING: So the candidates are smart to play it up. Look, Donald Trump at some point has to say, do I want to continue to defend or do I want this just to go away and let the courts take over?WILLIAMS: Well, Hillary Clinton, she doesn't have to dither about this. She says, hey, this is a culture. I think somebody else is in this, too. I think Alice Stewart.PERINO: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: There's a culture in the Trump campaign that leads these kinds of instance, Hillary Clinton, as you just saw in that bite also says, you know, something is wrong over there. Something smells.(CROSSTALK)BILA: Yeah. Well, that's the problem. It fits in to that story so well with him saying people are going to riot, if you know I'm not the guy or whatever his initial remark was. My issue, I understand what he's saying about loyalty. But you're being loyal to a guy who lied. He says he didn't touch her. You're being loyal to a guy that who went on Twitter and tried to smear Michelle Fields' reputation. This is not a noble guy that you're being loyal to. I'm sorry, but he has not presented himself well to me. I was not there. I don't know the force that was applied to her arm, the tape shows. I agree with you, Eric. You can interpret it a number of ways. But regardless, I really have to question Donald Trump and why he would want to be loyal to a guy that has portrayed himself to the rest of the world like this. I think this guy, Corey, is a huge liability for him. If he has political smart and he has some chops, you know what, this isn't good and fire this guy. This does not help you, Donald. When you are viewed as a guy who is anti-woman, you've been labeled, you have these issues with female voters clearly, this does not help you to have this front and central. Get rid of this guy and get to the issues. That will be my advice.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. I think a lot of Trump supporters would say that they admire the fact that he is loyal to the guy and not backing down. So< Greg, what struck me in this is that Ben Shapiro was the Michelle Fields' editor at Breitbart, he didn't just say Lewandowski lied. He said Trump lied.GUTFELD: Well, again, it is one of those things that instinctively takes sides. If I see this tape again, I'm going to throw up.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: It is like the (inaudible) film.BOLLING: Right.GUTFELD: It is like Oliver Stone is going to turn this into a movie and there will be a second grabber. A good tweet by Ross Douthat from the New York Time, which kind of summarizes, it is not about the jerk. What he says is Trump's handling of this is a blue print for turning a minor airspace issue with China into thermonuclear war. He is supposed to be a deal maker, he is supposed to be able to smooth things out. That's what we're looking from him right now. We want him to do this. And loyalty without that context is just stubbornness. You know, it has to be tethered to something. It could have been a spring shower and now it is a category 5 hurricane. He is supposed to be the deal maker.WILLIAMS: So how does it play out?GUTFELD: I don't know. If I knew.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Every cable news show will play it, continue to play it, until it just becomes its usefulness goes away. In the meantime, Florida decides whether or not they want to prosecute.WILLIAMS: I come back to something that Dana and Jedediah said. They both tapped into this as an issue for American women. It is not going to help with the women. And I think Trump is out today on something else, on abortion.PERINO: Yes, but we have to go. They're yelling.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I can't hear them yelling. If you want me to go, I'll go. Love is supposed to conquer all. But can it really conquer ISIS? The founder of Facebook thinks so. Up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: After every terror attack comes that naive response to evil, this Time it is from Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg who says to fight Islamic terrorists, we must create a world where everyone feels cared for and loved. And who would be against that? Oh yeah, Islamic terrorists, you butthead.Look, it is fine to say this tripe as long as there are others who are at work right now killing terrorists. Naive pacifism is the barnacle of the boat of vigilance. It depends on the commitment of others to kill. If we all thought like Zuck, we'd be... screwed.My solution? The math of terror is simple. They work 24/7 and must only succeed once. Free from the duties of building and preserving civilization, their world is more agile than ours. For a peaceful America, fighting terror is like a whale trying to swat a hummingbird. They are free to act, and we just react. But the only thing as agile as terror is our creative innovation unleashed in the marketplace.What has solved history's great horrors, from tyrants to disease to poverty, is American ingenuity. Terror like everything else evolves, picking soft targets as others harden. So the solution is an innovative private industry that hardens everything. In this changing world, as old jobs disappear, terror control provides the West with new meaningful work based on turning sitting ducks into well-armed lions. A chain of vocational schools that saves civilization from heathens. Maybe Zuckerberg should start it. After all, you can't update your status when you're dead.Jedediah, is Zuck right? All you need is love?BILA: Wouldn't that be great?GUTFELD: It would.BILA: I want to live in the utopia this guy lives in. Rainbows -- your unicorns are there.GUTFELD: I know.BILA: You can ride around. Pots of gold for everyone.GUTFELD: They're in shorty robes.BILA: Bernie Sanders could be paying for everyone's stuff on -- I don't know -- Eric's money or something. I don't know, no. I just got a dirty look from him.No, I think it's -- I think it's interesting that people can go through life and think this way. That somehow you can combat evil; people who seek to destroy; people who are attaching bombs to children and to women and seeking to just blow up people for the sake of it, and say, ""Well, if you're just kind to them, it will all go away."" It's fascinating.And if you look back in our history, if we had had this ideology, we wouldn't be here. None of us would be sitting here right now.GUTFELD: No. Love doesn't...BILA: America would not exist. It's like -- it's fascinating.GUTFELD: Love doesn't conquer all. In fact, Juan, what is ""love"" spelled backwards? ""Evol.""BOLLING: ""Evol.""GUTFELD: ""Evol.""WILLIAMS: Is that right? Oh, yes. Well, I think you're wrong. I really do.BILA: Really?WILLIAMS: I really do. I think...BILA: What, you have a unicorn for me and a rainbow?WILLIAMS: I love unicorns and rainbows. That's why I delight in his cup. I don't -- I want to drink from that cup one day.GUTFELD: You can.WILLIAMS: What I'm just saying, I think that in fact, you know, that horrible shooting we had down in South Carolina, I think one of the most amazing things that happened was that church, that the people didn't react by, ""Oh, we're going to go after white people."" No, I think...GUTFELD: Juan, that wasn't radical Islam. That wasn't radical Islam. You're talking about the church killing.WILLIAMS: No, it wasn't radical Islam.GUTFELD: Everybody was disgusted by what happened. But there were radical Islamists who cheered the beheadings.WILLIAMS: Right.GUTFELD: Love doesn't conquer that.WILLIAMS: I think that -- I think that you have to realize that, if you go after people specifically and just say it's all about the violence and not about winning over hearts and minds, it's not a winning effort.BOLLING: So this is exactly -- the pope actually started this, as well. He said we need to conquer ISIS with love. Mark Zuckerberg and the pope, frankly, are wrong on this. This is an extension of President Obama's ""Let's not tick off the terrorists by saying 'Islamic terrorism' or by keeping Gitmo open."" It doesn't work; they don't care, as evidenced by last week or the week before. ISIS among killing a group of people, slaughtered four nuns. I mean, if no one -- nuns have more love than anyone on the planet, and they want to kill them, too. So love? I think bullets are going to work a little bit better. Bullets and bombs over...GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: ... love.GUTFELD: Kill them not just with kindness but with guns.Why are -- why are people who are so smart in business so naive in this world? Is it just because you can only be an expert in one thing?PERINO: You're talking about Mark Zuckerberg?GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Who created Facebook, and now he's a gazillionaire?GUTFELD: Yes, and that wasn't created out of love. That was out of envy. He was looking to get -- well, anyway, go ahead.PERINO: I don't know that story. OK, you'll have to tell me.GUTFELD: Watch ""The Social Network.""PERINO: Here's the thing. I think that the best way to show love would be to snuff out the evil...GUTFELD: Yes. Yes.PERINO: ... and so that people in the Muslim world that are not radicalized can live peaceful lives and take care of their children. I mean, that's what -- they want that for their children just as much as we do. And the only way to actually provide that to them is to snuff out the evil that exists. And you can't do -- you're not going to love the jihadi out of his ambition (ph).GUTFELD: No. You're not. No.BILA: Aw.GUTFELD: Smother him with kisses and a pillow.President Obama has a new rationale for why we should overlook the terror threat and be open to taking in more Muslim refugees. Hear that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BILA: President Obama is renewing his push to bring thousands of Syria refugees to America. He did so today at an Easter prayer breakfast by urging Americans not to give into fear following recent Muslim terror attacks overseas. Instead he says, be open to welcoming those who are most in need of help.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was struck last week by an image of Pope Francis washing the feet of refugees. Different faiths, different countries. And what a powerful reminder of our obligations. If, in fact, we're not afraid and if, in fact, we hope and if, in fact, we believe, there's something that we have to -- we have to give.(END VIDEO CLIP)BILA: But there are very serious risks involved in taking in more migrants. Here's the president's former military intelligence chief.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LT. GEN. MICHAEL FLYNN (RET.), FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: Immigration is a national issue. We know that the Islamic State has decided and has the intention to infiltrate the immigrants that they are pouring into Europe. And that the potential that some of that will come into this country. We know for a fact that they have said, ""We are going to infiltrate into these immigration populations.""So knowing that, what we have to be really, really precise about is the individuals that are coming from select areas of the world. We have to be much better at how we vet them in order to bring the right kinds of people in.(END VIDEO CLIP)BILA: Juan, how does this -- help me out here. How does this make sense, given the information that they have? You just heard what he said. It's been shown that we can't really figure out who these people are. That the matter of checking them is not -- is imperfect. So given that, how is this a good idea right now?WILLIAMS: Well, if you're talking about Syrian refugees, people coming out of Syria.BILA: The screening process.WILLIAMS: Yes, but it's a two-year process. I don't know that it's so -- we're only talking, I think, it's like 100 people so far, although president says he wants to bring in 10,000.But I get the point. I get the point from General Flynn. I get your point, and I get FBI Director Comey's point that we can't vouch for the system being flawless.So the question is, if one person gets in, are you willing to take that risk? And I think that, in terms of what we've seen from Germany. I think they've taken a million, what we've seen. And we've seen problems. You can have the argument.But ultimately, I think we have to say, ""You know what? That Statue of Liberty means something.""BILA: What do you think most people think when they hear this, Eric?BOLLING: I think most are deathly afraid of President Obama not learning a lesson from Angela Merkel in Germany, who did take in 1.1 million refugees, now saying, ""What did we do here?"" I mean, they're clearly crossing borders. They're being radicalized. Do you really want radicalization happening here?Juan, the numbers aren't 10,000. President Obama said 65,000 is what he said, up to hundreds of thousands. And it's an 18-month vetting process, which I have a hunch wouldn't even be the case.It's smart to take a breath, find out what's going on, who we're bringing over. Comey, was it? No, I'm sorry. It was Morrell? Who was that?PERINO: Flynn.BOLLING: Flynn is right. ISIS has said, ""We will infiltrate the refugee programs around the globe."" Stop, just stop.BILA: Dana, smart for Republican candidates to go after him on this?PERINO: Well, I think -- I think that President Obama is missing the mood of the country. There was a Morning Consult poll that came out on Tuesday morning that shows that 50 percent of all Americans support a temporary ban on Muslims traveling to the United States; 71 percent of Republican voters but 34 percent of likely Democratic voters and 50 percent of independents. So that's one thing.What you don't hear President Obama say is that there would be a new strategy or a new policy in terms of helping to deal with the fact that we have a refugee crisis in the first place.And my recommendation would be you try to solve a refugee problem at its source. They don't want to be refugees. They want to be able to live peacefully in their home country where they were born, and that's where they want to have their families. But they were forced out because of the violence. If you solve that problem, then you can try to rebuild, and then they can be -- they don't have to be refugees any more.BILA: Gregory.GUTFELD: I am -- I am so tired of President Obama telling us not to give into fear. It's insulting to assume that we are actually scared. We are not scared. We're actually smart. We read the papers. We watch the news. We realize there are separate trains now for women in Germany to keep them away from men who are groping them. In this new age of terror, immigration is no longer the soft social issue, talking about openness; it's a national security issue. That's it.BOLLING: Moving on.BILA: All right. Well, coming up, Tebow, J. Lo and a ""Wheel of Fortune"" wizard. Coming up next in ""The Fastest Seven."" Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back. Time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: Fastest 7(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: ... ""Fastest Six and a Half or So on Television."" Three stirring stories, seven snappy minutes, one suasive [SIC] host.First up, Tim Tebow's days on the gridiron maybe over, but the former NFL star quarterback could -- no, not so star -- quarterback could try to tackle another field one day. Politics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What about this election cycle? Have you thought about politics? You'd be such a good role model for these kids.TIM TEBOW, FORMER NFL QUARTERBACK: Well, thank you. It's been crazy, hasn't it? It's been a whirlwind, watching everything. But, you know, I don't know, in this time in my life, but you know, anyway that I can...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're saying there's hope. There's a chance.TEBOW: You know what? There's a chance you could make a difference in some day on some things, then that would be intriguing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: OK, Juan, you're a football fan and a politics fan. Your thoughts on Tebow running for something?WILLIAMS: Well, you know, he did an ad that I saw for Focus on the Family. It was a pro-life ad, and I thought it was effective. He is very effective with young people, especially, because they look up to him. He won the Heisman. When did he win the Heisman? Like, you know, seven years, something like that. So I mean, he's a hero to a lot of people, and his faith, his example, I think, is pretty strong.Could he win? I don't know. Because guess what? A lot of times athletes, they think, ""Oh, it's going to be easy in politics."" There's a long road, strewn with...BOLLING: I think it depends where he runs, Jedediah.BILA: That's true. I mean, he's young. He's charismatic; he's adorable. No one's going to argue that.I don't know why he would want to do it, why he would want to get into the dirty business of politics. But if he feels called to it, I think he would be successful. And definitely, young people would be excited about it.BOLLING: Greg.GUTFELD: He can't spell ""four."" It's f-o-u-r. Got to get that hat fixed.You know, I'm assuming he's a Republican and he's going to run as a Republican, and I'm always interested in that. Athletes are almost always conservative. And I realize it's because they share a simple equation, which is effort plus time equals reward, which is exactly the equation for free-market capitalism. It's exactly how you win the game.BOLLING: What do you think, Dana? Tebow as -- I don't know, senator? Congressman?PERINO: Can I admit something? That I spent the entire -- I misread this earlier today. I spent the entire day thinking that Peyton Manning had decided to consider running for office, and which I thought made a lot of since. Because, you know, he would -- he's finished his career.BOLLING: Yes.PERINO: John Elway thought about it. He's in Denver. So...GUTFELD: In that case.PERINO: ... if Tim Tebow wants to run, I think that's great.BOLLING: Stay right there, because you've got the first one on this one. A lot of celebrities have joined the ""Late, Late Show"" host James Corden to join ""Carpool Karaoke."" J. Lo is the latest to ride shotgun.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENNIFER LOPEZ, SINGER/ACTRESS: (SINGING ""LOVE DON'T COST A THING,"" ""JENNY FROM THE BLOCK"")JAMES CORDEN, HOST, ""LATE, LATE SHOW"": Who's the most famous person that's in that phone?LOPEZ: I don't know.CORDEN: Leonardo Di Caprio. Hey, baby, I feel (ph) like I need to cut loose. Any suggestions?LOPEZ: I'm not going to let you send that.CORDEN: Gone.No. What did he say?LOPEZ: He said, ""You mean tonight, Boo-boo? Club-wise?""(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Love those. Love those.PERINO: I think that the stars must enjoy that so much. Because it's not that high pressure, but they can just absolutely be themselves. And everyone seems to have a lot of fun. I could never do it.BOLLING: Don't you -- are you going to -- do you not like this?GUTFELD: No. She owes -- she owes me money.BOLLING: J. Lo?GUTFELD: She -- we shot her for ""Stuff"" magazine in about 2000, 2001. And she left with a diamond pedant in her belly button, and I didn't have the guts to ask for it back during the shoot, because she's standing there with Benny Medina, and she's like, looks great. And then she's like, ""Oh, that was a great photo shoot."" And she walks away with the -- I think it was a 15 grand belly button ring in her belly button.BOLLING: Wow.BILA: Wow!BOLLING: Are you a fan of this?BILA: I love her. I'm a big fan of ""Jenny from the Block."" And they asked her if it's true; he asked if she ensured her butt, and she said no. And she should, because that is a good booty. That is the best booty I have ever seen.GUTFELD: You haven't seen mine.BOLLING: Juan.BILA: I don't want to see yours.BOLLING: You want to weigh in?BILA: That's a scary visual. Everyone at home is crying now.WILLIAMS: I think you're worried for me. I have the last...BOLLING: You brought that up.WILLIAMS: Oh, no, no. I won't say a word. You know me. I'm a man of discretion.But I will say this. I like ""Comedians in Cars"" better than this, although Jedidiah tells me should I see Adele with James Corden. You think that...BILA: That's amazing, yes. These are great. These are, like, my favorites.BOLLING: By the way, they said something like every 13 minutes of this thing takes, like, an hour and a half to film.BILA: Oh, I'm sure.BOLLING: Finally, a present to you, a man who could be the greatest ""Wheel of Fortune"" player ever.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAT SAJAK, HOST, ""WHEEL OF FORTUNE"": Go.

Good luck.SANTOLI: Goofy pictures.SAJAK: You got it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Holy smokes. Robert Santoli blew viewers away Friday after solving the first puzzle with only one letter on the board. He went on to solve a string of others, racking up more than 76 grand in cash.PERINO: I'm a huge ""Wheel of Fortune"" fan. I've been watching it since I was a kid. It's Jasper's favorite show. He likes the ""ding-ding,"" and he watches the entire thing.I didn't know what -- he knew what the general topics were going to be, so he studied a lot. He must have a really good eye -- like eye memory type of thing so he could recognize it right away.BOLLING: Greg, do you think our friend Pat Sajak cheated and slipped him the answers?GUTFELD: I think -- I think Sajak was off on the side, going like this, holding the thing.

Every letter except for one is in ""Islamic terrorist."" And he can't get it.BILA: I haven't seen that, but I like that. My mom was amazing growing up. She used to get these. You could have a seven-letter word with six letters in there, and I would be like -- my middle name. Thank you.PERINO: I probably would buy too many vowels.BOLLING: Final thought on this.WILLIAMS: You know, I thought the guy was a genius, but then I did what, you know, Dana did. And realized that he was told it was a nautical theme. And he went back and looked at previous ""Wheel of Fortunes"" and had it.GUTFELD: I think he should be arrested.BOLLING: ""One More Thing"" next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" Sorry, I thought you were going first. But it is actually me that is going. Supposed to introduce the wonderful Juan Williams.GUTFELD: There you go.WILLIAMS: You're very kind.So it was 35 years ago today that Ronald Reagan was shot by John Hinckley. Six shots. The last one, the sixth shot, hit the car, ricocheted and then hit the president under his left arm, landed near the president's heart.It was an incredible day in Washington. James Brady, the press secretary, shot in the head. He died in 2014. D.C. Police Officer Thomas Delahanty shot in the neck, still alive to this day. And Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy, he was putting his body over the president. He took a bullet in the abdomen. He's still alive.Hinckley, who was then just 25 years old and said he was doing this to impress the actress, Jodie Foster. He is still alive. Last year in 2015 he sought release, full release from the asylum, St. Elizabeth, in Washington. Not granted. Good idea.PERINO: Were you covering...WILLIAMS: I was an editorial writer at the time. I remember the ""Washington Post"" just shut down. It was like, wow. What is -- we thought the president was in serious trouble.PERINO: All right. Greg, you are next.GUTFELD: Time for something new.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Hygiene Tips(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Love that squeaky little noise. It's a shorty robe, by the way.You know, when you're taking a bath it's important that you make sure that the tub fits you and it's not too small. We have a picture of Alec Baldwin at a spa over the weekend.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(POLAR BEAR SITTING ON TINY TUB)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: He had actually gone there to get some soak, a big soak out there. But the -- you see the tub is too small for his large girth. They actually had to send a helicopter in to pull him out and air drop him to a larger tub of water.PERINO: That's really good advice.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Great tips. Thank you for that.I could -- I could have had your graphic of ""I Hate These People"" today.GUTFELD: All right.PERINO: Because I read about this woman. She is such a jerk to a cab driver. She took the taxi 150 miles to her Pennsylvania home from New York.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Stiffed him $600 on the fare. Said she would go upstairs and get cash. She never came back. She's finally at least been arrested. The driver is Rahman Atiqur. He was really cool about it. He waited. He took her all that way. But she tried to stiff him for that money. She says she's good for it, and I home that is true, but don't ever do that.GUTFELD: Not very nice.PERINO: Eric.BOLLING: Very quickly.
