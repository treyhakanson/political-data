This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN,FOX NEWS HOST: Donald Trump opens up a new front. It's not just big rallies and debates. Today, the GOP front-runner taking to the editorial pages, writing an op-ed in the ""Wall Street Journal"" that leaves his usual brash behavior at the door.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, my rallies are the safest places to be on Earth. And nobody wants to report that. The dishonest media will never report that.""Lyin' Ted Cruz."" Ever heard of him?Boy, he's going way down in the polls. He is now third. A lot of people, they tell me, I don't know, but they tell me, they like Trump because he is a straight talker. The honest truth, we have to be straight talkers. This political correctness is killing our country. It's killing us. It's killing us.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: Former presidential candidate and Donald Trump supporter, Governor Mike Huckabee, goes ON THE RECORD.Good evening, governor.MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Greta, how are you doing?Now, I have not endorsed anybody. I think everybody believes I'm a supporter. Look, I have been a defender of Donald Trump because I feel like that a lot of people have misrepresented his message. He beat me, so it's not like I'm putting my arms around him, you know, in an endorsing way.But, you know, he is the leader. He is the one who has captured the attention of America.VAN SUSTEREN: What do you think about the op-ed -- the op-ed in the ""Wall Street Journal?""I mean, he is pretty much indicting the delegates system, at least as far as Colorado goes, saying things like that the nominee is chosen by delegates and not by the people.HUCKABEE: Well, he is spot-on. I thought it was a brilliant editorial. And what he did, which was so masterful, and frankly, it was an important pivot for him to make.Because the last couple of weeks, he has talked a whole lot about how he has been mistreated. What he did brilliantly in this editorial was to tie his treatment from the political class to the treatment that Americans are feeling from the political class.And the last sentence in the editorial, I thought sums it up.He said, you know, ""The politicians and the political class have had it their way for a long time. Let 2016 be the year that the American people get theirs.""And that's why Donald Trump has done so well. He has touched that nerve of people who are sick and tired of the political class running all over them.VAN SUSTEREN: Why in the ""Wall Street Journal"" op-ed page? Because chances are when he stands up in front of a rally, and all the news organizations take his words, he is going to get a lot more people hearing it than who may be reading the ""Wall Street Journal"" at an op-ed page.And, frankly, do you know what I mean? It's not going to reach, you know, the demographics that he might necessarily want to reach.HUCKABEE: Well, chances are there were readers of the ""Wall Street Journal"" all over America, who were spewing their copy as they read Donald Trump's words in the paper. But that was precisely the point.He took his message to the people who were least ready to receive it. But guess what, we are talking about it tonight. And all day long, people have been talking about it.So, again, it was a smart move on his part showing that uncanny, savvy he has in getting the media to focus on what he is saying.VAN SUSTEREN: I get his principle that the delegates in Colorado choose the nominee, and the delegates are chosen by the so-called party elite, not by the voters. I get that objection to it.What I don't quite understand, though, is that this wasn't something that was sprung on him last week. That this apparently were part of the rules and the rules were disclosed to all the candidates, I assume you as well, on October 1st.So is it a little bit too late to sort of have this after he has lost those delegates to suddenly complain about it?HUCKABEE: Well, look, the rules are indeed the rules. But, there is another fact about this that I think he has been right about. Sometimes these rules can be manipulated. And it really means that when a person gets the most votes, you would assume, well, they are going to get the delegates.But if you don't even have votes, it may be what's legal. But I think a lot of people would say, but that's just not right.VAN SUSTEREN: Right. I got that.HUCKABEE: We're supposed to have an election, not a selection.VAN SUSTEREN: I got that. But the problem is because of the timing of it, that because it wasn't done last October, after he lost the delegates.Naturally, the criticism is going to be that he might not have criticized it had he won all the delegates in Colorado. And I guess that's still a problem. And maybe it's just his campaign was a little bit behind in terms of reading the rules of the various states.But it's a timing issue, I think, that's going to come back to haunt him a little bit on this.HUCKABEE: Oh, no doubt.But, look, Greta. Let's be honest. If Trump had won Colorado and gotten all the delegates, he wouldn't have said, gee, that's not fair. I got all the delegates. Let me give some away. But I understand that.But in politics when you're explaining, you're losing. And here's what has happened.He has made the charge that it was a rigged deal. And now you have the Colorado Republican Convention, you have the RNC and you have Ted Cruz trying to explain the process.They're losing. He is winning the argument. Because all he has to do is to say, gee, it wasn't fair. And they have to go in and explain the fine print. And that's where you always lose, politically, is when you have to explain something.VAN SUSTEREN: Governor, you know, I think I agree that the whole process seems a little bit silly. Every state has a different set of rules. And so, I mean, I can understand why everybody thinks -- a lot of people think it's a pretty nutty system from coast to coast. But, anyway, governor, thank you for joining us.HUCKABEE: Great to be here, Greta."	['Cruz', 'Trump']	[]

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!Hi, I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight. The nation in an uproar over Hillary Clinton and today FBI Director James Comey had to explain himself in a House Committee. The talking points memo usually heard in this spot will be later on because the Comey testimony is our lead story. Republican congressman not happy with the director. Democratic Congress people trying to petty fog the issue not really interested in what happened. In other words, partisan politics. Dominated the hearing. But there were a few interesting moments.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did Hillary Clinton lie under oath?COMEY: Not to the FBI, not in a case we're working.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you review the documents where Congressman Jim Jordan asked her specifically and she said, quote, ""There was nothing marked classified on my emails either sent or received,"" end quote?COMEY: I don't remember reviewing that particular testimony but aware of that being said though.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the FBI investigate her statements under oath on this topic?COMEY: Not to my knowledge. I don't think there has been a referral from Congress.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you need a referral from Congress to investigate her statements under oath?COMEY: Sure do.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You'll have one.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now, I don't really understand that, why the FBI cannot investigate public statements made under oath in the course of an investigation without a specific referral. We have been trying to find out very specifically. I don't want to make any mistakes here so we are working on it. Now, most of the other testimony was a rehash of what has already been said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Secretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her emails either sent or received. Was that true?COMEY: That's not true there were a small number of portion markings on I think three of the documents.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Secretary Clinton said did I not email any classify material to any one on my email, there is no classified material, what is that through?COMEY: There was classified material email.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Secretary Clinton said she used just one device. Was that true?COMEY: She used multiple devices during the four years of her term as secretary of state.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: In the end few minds will be changed by the Comey testimony today. His fallback position remains the same.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are concerned. What does it take for someone to misuse classified information and get in trouble for it?COMEY: It takes mishandling it and criminal intent.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And so an unauthorized server in the basement is not mishandling?COMEY: Oh, no, there is evidence of mishandling here. This whole investigation on the end focused is there sufficient evidence of intent.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Joining us now from Washington, attorney and former aide to President Clinton, David Goodfriend and former Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Virginia, Ken Cuccinelli. So, I know you are a state guy Mr. Cuccinelli. But can you give me a little bit of explanation about why the FBI ignored Secretary Clinton's under oath testimony in front of Congressional Committees because that speaks to perjury in a case that they're investigating. Does it not?KEN CUCCINELLI (R), FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VIRGINIA: Well, there is also, in addition to that, Bill, there is a statute. We're used to hearing about obstruction of justice. There is a separate federal statute that addresses attempts to mislead law enforcement investigations and other investigations in to wrongdoing not based on sitting there with an FBI agent but on other statements and you identified in your introduction statements under oath that the FBI identified as false and there were public statements in Director Comey's press conference that he identified that were false. That's a felony by itself.O'REILLY: Well, it's disturbing here and because if Director Comey is saying and he did, Mr. Goodfriend that we did a thorough and honest investigation yet, on the record in front of a Congressional Committee, under oath, there is Secretary Clinton denying a bunch of things that Director Comey says happened. Then why wouldn't Comey then use the record under oath as part of his investigation?DAVID GOODFRIEND, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, he essentially left the door open, I think.O'REILLY: But why wouldn't he do it in the beginning? Doesn't that disturb you as an American? This is supposed to be a comprehensive --GOODFRIEND: Well, I can answer it.O'REILLY: Go ahead.GOODFRIEND: So the answer to your question is, the law enforcement agency is addressing the allegation of a crime. They can expand their investigation. They can add other elements to it. But that was not within the scope of the FBI's charge.O'REILLY: Okay, explain that to me though. Let me pose the question, explain it to me.GOODFRIEND: Okay.O'REILLY: What the FBI is trying to tell the American people is that there was no intent.GOODFRIEND: Um-huh.O'REILLY: All right. To subvert the laws of the United States. Yet, the Secretary goes in front of a Congressional Committee under oath and does not tell the truth. Doesn't that indicate intent to deceive was there?GOODFRIEND: No. Because what the director said was she told the truth to me to the FBI, to our questions. So, look. You can ask and I think this is perfectly legitimate question.(CROSSTALK)O'REILLY: Did she tell the truth to the FBI if that's what the FBI is saying.GOODFRIEND: Now you have the committee saying.O'REILLY: Did you tell the truth to the Congressional Committee and that's provable and Comey didn't even look at it?GOODFRIEND: So I think, Bill, what Comey signaled to the chairman of this committee was there is nothing stopping me from taking that up. Give me the referral.O'REILLY: I got that but I'm upset, Mr. Cuccinelli --CUCCINELLI: Yes.O'REILLY: Because I heard the words out of Comey's mouth that this was a top shelf comprehensive investigation by the best guys in the country and here we have Congressman Chaffetz blowing the lid off it right in front of him.CUCCINELLI: Yes, look, Bill, when law enforcement talks about a thorough investigation. That typically, especially in the case of the federal government, the FBI and the Department of Justice or department of whatever they are now, it usually means anything we find in this first narrow investigation that is similar or related will be included. That's what comprehensive, that's what thorough means. And they say this themselves.I mean, the biggest failure here on Director Comey's part is he did not meet his own measuring stick. You mentioned, Bill, that he talked about zeroing in not on intent but on criminal intent. And that's important because clearly then Secretary of State or incoming Secretary of State Clinton intentionally set that server up in a way that she knew would be off a classified system and then she used it for four years. That was intentional act.O'REILLY: She can justify that by saying.CUCCINELLI: That's not enough to prosecute.O'REILLY: Okay.CUCCINELLI: That's not right.O'REILLY: She can justify by saying she has other secretaries of state have done it.CUCCINELLI: That is not true. It is true. It is true.O'REILLY: Not to the extent the other secretaries of state.CUCCINELLI: No other secretary of state set up their own servers.O'REILLY: So, I'm under the gun on time, gentlemen. I'm under the gun on time. One more question Mr. Goodfriend. You got 30 seconds to answer it. Okay. Isn't it troubling to you as an American, Mr. Goodfriend, that the head of the FBI, who had clear access to all of Secretary Clinton's testimony in front of a Congressional Committee under oath, says that he did not even take that into account in his comprehensive investigation? Is that not troubling?GOODFRIEND: Congressman Cooper from Tennessee put it best, a lot of armchair prosecutors today. I trust this top prosecutor and so should you and so should all Americans.O'REILLY: I'm troubled by it?GOODFRIEND: When we attack law enforcement, when we attack law enforcement, that attack the rule of law, Bill.O'REILLY: Not attacking. I'm raising the rule of law.GOODFRIEND: The constitution of the United States, that's what we ought to be supporting here.O'REILLY: All right. What we ought to be supporting here is the truth and to get to the truth because we're talking about the President of the United States here. Gentlemen, good debate.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What I think the people of New York care about is not candidates bickering like children. I think what the people of New York care about is, how do we bring jobs back to New York? How do we raise wages? How do we keep Americans safe? And that's my focus.(APPLAUSE)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: During a debate Cruz talked about New York values. Oh, New York values. Boy, he wished he didn't say that, right? That was a bad thing. And he said it with hatred toward New Yorkers.GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Here in New York, we feel good. We're going to get delegates, we believe out of New York. At least I hope so.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Three candidates campaigning in New York as you take a look at the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, Donald Trump with a big lead in New York, John Kasich in second, according to the recent polls. There you see Ted Cruz. As you jump forward to Pennsylvania the following week, one of the states the following Tuesday. And there you see, too, Donald Trump with a sizeable lead over Cruz and Kasich in the average of polls.It is Friday. That means that we take a trip down to a place we call Candidate Casino. OK, Byron, is this your first time in the casino?BYRON YORK, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: I believe it is.BAIER: Welcome.YORK: I have never been wrong yet.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: OK, $100 in chips. Who will be the nominee?YORK: Well, I think Trump is about to start a pretty good run. So I put Trump at $70. I put Ted Cruz at $25. I put John Kasich at $5. I would have made Kasich $1 if the rules allowed. But --BAIER: It's a $5 table.YORK: As they say at the RNC, the rules are the rules. I think, know, I think Trump is -- first of all, he has the best path to the 1,237. But he also has a better path to even close to 1,237. You know, a lot of people have said to me well, close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. But if he gets close to there within 50, 75 delegates, I think a lot of people are going to say do we blow up the convention over this? And so I think Trump certainly needs to get to that line, but he may not need to get all the way there on the first day of the convention.BAIER: All right, Juan?JUAN WILLIAMS, THE HILL: So, this is not my -- I can't say this is my first time in the casino.BAIER: No.WILLIAMS: But I don't think there is much question Donald Trump is in the lead here. So I would give him $75. I put $75 down. Cruz I think had a good week to this extent. It was not in general a good week. But his work on the second round of delegates, if they go to a second vote at the convention, seems to have been effective. He seems to have lined up his people, have to vote for Trump on the first go around. But if it comes to an open convention and a second vote, they are not at that point committed to vote for Donald Trump and Cruz has his people in position to take advantage. So I put $25 on Cruz.BAIER: What is clear is that Trump is capitalizing on this Colorado deal. And he wrote this op-ed in the Wall Street Journal: ""Mr. Cruz has toured the country bragging -- gone around the country, toured the country, bragging about his voter-less victory in Colorado."" He mentions it now on every stop on the stump, and it's powerful.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: It is. And I think it accounts for his recovery from the Trump slump, the two weeks where he made a lot of mistakes with Heidi Cruz and all the other stuff. And he has gone back to his theme. He found a powerful argument. He sort of has a genius for sniffing these things out and then staying with it, a very strong argument. I think it's wrong on the facts about Colorado, but it's the theme of his campaign. Everything is rigged, including this.So I put $70 on him, $25 on Cruz, $5 -- now, I have to explain this one, wine, women, and song, because I have been told that my forays into opioids and hallucinogens to fend off the melancholy of this campaign has set a bad example for the children of the country. For the children, I'm returning to more traditional diversions.BAIER: For the kids, thank you. I'm glad you didn't get to hemlock. I appreciate that.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: OK, let's go to the other side of the casino, the Democratic side, and far fewer to bet on here. But, also, some developments on this side. You have the debate last night, and then you had one of the candidates, Bernie Sanders going to the Vatican for this conference. And the one big image coming out of this trip is Bernie Sanders shaking the hand of Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia. Lots of images on A.P., and that's the video of that sitting next to him there. Not exactly a fan of the U.S.YORK: The other image you are not seeing is him with the Pope. Put me down with the people who think this is a crazy idea. So we go from this debate last night where we talk -- saw basically two seniors just screaming at each other most of the time, to this. I don't think Bernie has a chance. So I put $90 on Hillary. I put $10 on Bernie just to make it a contest.  BAIER: Juan, quickly, your bets.WILLIAMS: I think I will go $85, Byron. And I will put $15 on Bernie out of respect. Bernie has exceeded expectations. He had a great turnout this week at the park with I think 27,000 people. He has got the Verizon strikers lined up. Upset wouldn't -- I mean, it would be a surprise, but not that much.KRAUTHAMMER: As usual, you guys are underselling Hillary. It's $90. And the only reason there were $10 outstanding of that is if she loses the Comey primary, meaning the FBI. Absence of an indictment, it's $100 on Hillary.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Personal Story"" segment tonight. Division in Hollywood. Show business is a Liberal Democratic concern these days. But there is deep division between those supporting Hillary Clinton versus Bernie Sanders. Here are some Clinton supporters in the show business industry. George Clooney, Jamie Foxx, Debra Messing, Ben Affleck, Robert de Niro, Will Farrell, Beyonce, Kim Kardashian. Just partial list.On the Sanders side, another partial list, Susan Sarandon, Danny Devito, Mia Farrow, Michael Moore, Neil Young, Spike Lee, Danny Glover. Side note, Donald Trump does have some Hollywood support. Kirstie Alley, Charlie Sheen, Gary Busey, Scott Baio, John Voight, Wayne Newton.Joining us now from Los Angeles, Janice Min, president of the Hollywood Reporter Billboard Media Group. I'm interested in the economic fallout here. Many Republican actors have told me directly that they don't talk politics because they are going to lose jobs if they do. They are not going to get hired. Because you know how subjective any hiring is in entertainment. Is this the case with Sanders-Clinton fissure? Is that going on there?JANICE MIN, PRESIDENT, THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER-BILLBOARD MEDIA GROUP: Listen, we're just beginning to see the effects of what's going to happen here. And it's getting personal and it's getting ugly at times. Twitter, of course, the new medium of the election is aflame with people having freak-outs and we saw this with this Susan Sarandon, Debra Messing twitter war last week when she said jokingly, we think said she would vote for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton because she is a Sanders' supporter. I mean, these two are not going to be starring in any budding comment. There will be no Selma and sequel starring this two again.O'REILLY: So, they were tweeting back, they were tweeting back and forth having a conversation that millions of people could see.MIN: Yes.O'REILLY: Um-huh.MIN: Aha!O'REILLY: It was about Sarandon wanting big change and messing saying no, Hillary Clinton is -- so why can't they both be friends and support either candidate. I don't understand.MIN: Well, okay, in the end, in the general election they will. Hollywood will come together.O'REILLY: Sure.MIN: And voted against whoever the Republicans.O'REILLY: Sure.MIN: But right now, like, listen, this is a town of people with high emotions. Lots of conviction. Everyone thinks that he or she is right. And there will be no consensus until the convention. None.O'REILLY: All right. Now, does it play out though in the way jobs are secured? Do you believe that there is -- you know, if you are a director, for example, and you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, you are not going to hire Debra Messing to do a sitcom, I mean, is that possible?MIN: Listen, there are people here who will take things to the extreme. There are people who hold long vendettas here. If you look though, Hillary Clinton is someone who, of course, has one of the longest memories and she is back making friends with the people who turned against her and supported Obama in 2008.O'REILLY: Okay. Yes. And some of them are giving her money, right?MIN: Yes. Listen, there are some people who are holding their nose and giving her money because they want a Democrat to win the White House. There are others who actually wholeheartedly support her. In terms of jobs being lost, maybe. The thing with Hollywood, Hollywood has mastered the skill of rejecting people with a smile on its face. So you will never -- actors say this all the time. You will never even know why you didn't get a job. Why you didn't get a role because no one will ever tell you the real reasons. And sure, some of that is personal at times. I don't know yet if the election will play a part in that. As far as Democrats go. But you are right about Republicans here. To get anyone to self-identify as a Republican here is nearly impossible.O'REILLY: All right. And on that note, it's probably --MIN: On that note, one person, one famous performer came out for Donald Trump. Roll the tape.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KIRSTIE ALLEY, ACTRESS: Donald Trump, whether you like him or don't like him, is waking this country up. And for that alone, I am -- you know, if you hate him, then you are going to talk about how much you hate him. If you love him, you are going to talk about how much you love him. And I think that that's a really great step with this country because I think this country has gotten very complacent.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now, will Miss Alley pay a price for saying that?MIN: Okay. The thing with Kirstie Alley ism she has all that cheers money keep counting and counting and counting. It is very safe for her to say that.O'REILLY: Surely she wants to have --MIN: -- attacked and vilified.O'REILLY: Sure she wants to be --MIN: Sure. Yes. Sure. Listen, there are people who don't -- who won't - - probably have -- because of Scientology. She is a scientologist. Who might ice her out a little because of this. You know, these are very like- minded people here in Hollywood. It's very clubby. And when people step out of line, they sometimes get their hands slapped. That is true.O'REILLY: Yes. Well, some of them try to slap my hands occasionally. And I enjoy that.(LAUGHTER)MIN: Yes. But you have done just fine, I think.O'REILLY: Yes. Did Miss Alley pay price? Did anybody go after him?MIN: There is a lot of reaction online. But, you know, we can't -- we live in a climate where among certain in certain conversations that even giving a positive nod to Donald Trump speaking his mind is seen as an endorsement.O'REILLY: Yes, sure.MIN: Is seen as -- there is nothing nice to say about him to some people.O'REILLY: I do admire people like John Voight who, you know, he has the courage of his convictions. He is a tremendous actor. He still works. That's a good thing. I know there are a lot of people in Hollywood who would like to speak out but just don't. Last word.MIN: Yes. I mean, yes. You know friends of Abe. Right? The Hollywood Association of Republicans here trying to get the member list of friends of Abe.O'REILLY: No.MIN: I mean, you couldn't pay a million dollars and get anyone to disclose that here.O'REILLY: Yes. And they had their meetings in Guam. That's where they go to meet.(LAUGHTER)Janice, I appreciate you coming on. We appreciate it.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
