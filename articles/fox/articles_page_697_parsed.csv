"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" August 13, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!Hi. I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight.Our top story, one of the early surprises of this political season is the strong campaign run by Dr. Ben Carson. Yesterday a CNN poll showed Carson running a strong second to front-runner Donald Trump in Iowa. And he hasn't been shy about jumping into controversy.Take these provocative comments he's made about Planned Parenthood --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARSON: Maybe I'm not objective when it comes to Planned Parenthood. But you know, I know who Margaret Sanger is. And I know that she believed in eugenics and that she was not particularly enamored with black people. And one of the reasons that you find most of their clinics in black neighborhoods is so that you can find a way to control that population.And I think people should go back and read about Margaret Sanger who founded this place, a woman who Hillary Clinton, by the way, says that she admires.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Joining us now from Manchester, New Hampshire to further explain, Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson.Dr. Carson -- thank you for joining us. Dr. Carson -- do you stand by that comment?DR. CARSON: Absolutely. No question about it. Anybody can easily find out about Margaret Sanger and what kind of person she was and how she was a strong advocate of eugenics, wrote articles about you eugenics and believed that certain members of the population weakened the population and was not enamored of black people. And it is quite true -- quite true that the majority or plurality of their clinics are in minority neighborhoods.BOLLING: And you're saying that it's a direct correlation, in other words, she decided to put Planned Parenthood clinics in African-American communities to control the population of African-Americans in the community?DR. CARSON: I think it's a very clear direction that she's going in with her philosophy.BOLLING: And you say she was developing some eugenics studies, which would mean control of African-Americans in society. Is it that or is it -- you know, let me play devil's advocate a little bit -- that 30 percent of abortions occur among black women whereas the population number is 13 percent, so it's almost triple the number of abortions rate for African- Americans as whites.DR. CARSON: Well, it brings up a very important issue. And that is do those black lives matter? You know, the number one cause of death for black people is abortion. And I wonder if maybe some people might at some point become concerned about that and ask, why is that happening? And what can be done to alleviate that situation? I think that's really the important question.BOLLING: Dr. Carson, if you're right and Planned Parenthood does have a mandate to go into black communities to control the black population, what would you do, what would you suggest people do now and if you were president?DR. CARSON: Well, one of the important things is to educate people. I encourage people to go and read about Margaret Sanger and go and read about the beginnings of this organization so that you know what you're dealing with. You know, one of the ways that they're able to perpetrate the deceit is because people are not informed. The more people are informed, the less likely these kinds of things happen. Some of our founders expressed how important it was to have an informed populace because they could not be manipulated.BOLLING: So, we're talking over literally decades over time and the policy is still being implemented in 2015 of literally black population control through Planned Parenthood?DR. CARSON: Well, what's going on now versus what went on at the beginning, I don't know. Probably a lot of the people in Planned Parenthood themselves don't know about this history. And perhaps if they did, they wouldn't be quite so anxious to be involved with it.BOLLING: Ok.Let's talk a little bit about some of the other things that Planned Parenthood is accused of. They're accused of selling baby parts. Can you talk to us about baby parts or can you talk to us about fetal tissue because I understand that you've worked with fetal tissue in the past.DR. CARSON: Well, I have not actually worked with fetal tissue. The left has put out information saying that I've done research on fetal tissues because my name appears on an article in which the pathologist compared specimens that I delivered from the operating room to some fetal tissues in an attempt to decide which way the cells were being differentiated.My part is to do the operation and supply the tissue. At that point, I move on to the next operation. So to suggest that I'm in the laboratory actually doing the research or retrieving fetal tissue is nothing but propaganda.BOLLING: And I think that's an important distinction to make and I'm glad you made it here on The Factor tonight because it's been swirling all day long that Dr. Ben Carson has worked with fetal tissue. He's done studies with fetal tissue. And you're saying what you've done is after a procedure is done, maybe it's to save a mother's life, you may have been in contact with fetal tissue but you had no part in the scientific research of the tissue once it's left the operating room?DR. CARSON: Correct. And also bear in mind that all pathology departments will have a whole array of tissues, you know, from day one of conception until 99 years old. And if you use the tissue -- if you're comparing or looking for a disease process in elderly people, does that mean you're doing geriatric research on geriatric tissue? No. It means you're looking at your tissue bank and you're making comparisons to derive information.And those fetal tissues, by the way, come from a variety of different places -- you know, ectopic pregnancies, spontaneous abortions but just because, you know, they get the fetal tissue does it mean they should throw it out. Of course they don't. That's how science is advanced.BOLLING: Right. And I think the law -- the reason why the law came involved into Planned Parenthood is because they were accused of profiting from the fetal tissue.Dr. Carson, can we turn to politics here a little bit. Donald Trump's rise in the polls, he seems to have a lot of staying power. Your thoughts on the Trump candidacy?DR. CARSON: Well, I think that he's bringing a lot of energy to the Republican party. He's bringing in people who perhaps would have sat out and just felt disgusted. And in the long run, I think that helps to expand the base.You know, Donald Trump is Donald Trump, for other people to try to make him into somebody else is probably a futile endeavor.BOLLING: Sure. And some would say that the strongest three candidates -- the three strongest candidates over the last week or so have been Trump, Carson and Fiorina -- three people who have never held public office before.DR. CARSON: Which goes to my point that, you know, to solve problems doesn't necessarily require a lot of political experience. I mean you look at someone like -- let's not name someone but you can figure out who I'm talking about -- was a United States senator, was secretary of state, had been around politics for many, many years and yet did not have the judgment to know that you don't put important information that could jeopardize your country on a personal server. So if all of that political experience doesn't do that for you, maybe that's not what is necessary to solve our problem.BOLLING: Dr. Carson, I have to go. Just one quick question, if it's Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, who would you rather run against?DR. CARSON: I would be delighted to run against either one of them, to be honest with you. It would be an easy distinction.BOLLING: Are you sure you didn't do politics before? We're going to leave it right there. Dr. Carson, thank you very much.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

8	8	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/05/10/bill-oreilly-justice-obama-and-trump/	Bill O'Reilly: Justice, Obama and Trump	"Talking Points enjoyed watching the president's speech to the graduating class of Howard University on Saturday.  It was interesting and delivered with energy.Mr. Obama's words were important because they addressed the division that we are seeing in America - a divide that has catapulted Donald Trump to the Republican nomination.There are four speech points I would like to analyze tonight, beginning with the status of black Americans:OBAMA: ""In 1983, I was part of fewer than 10 percent of African-Americans who graduated with a bachelor's degree.  Today, you're part of the more than 20 percent who will.  And more than half of blacks say we're better off than our parents were at our age -- and that our kids will be better off, too. (EDIT) America is better.  The world is better. And stay with me now -- race relations are better since I graduated.""The problem is race relations are now on the decline.  The core constituency of Donald Trump is white, working class - primarily men.They feel that the federal government no longer speaks for them, that they are the ones getting hammered by a growing nanny state heavy on grievance - only not their grievance.The president made a passing reference to middle-aged white guys and how they should be understood.  But at this point words are meaningless.The Obama doctrine of income redistribution has made it tougher on the working and middle classes as they watch salaries stagnate and health insurance costs rise under ObamaCare.Of course, none of that is the fault of African-Americans.  It is the government who has alienated so many white working folks by basically ignoring them.The second point - Mr. Obama made plays into the first one:OBAMA: ""We've got a justice gap when too many black boys and girls pass through a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails.  This is one area where things have gotten worse.  When I was in college, about half a million people in America were behind bars.  Today, there are about 2.2 million.  Black men are about six times likelier to be in prison right now than white men.""So why are there so many more Americans in prison?  Three reasons: father's abandoning their children, a culture that glorifies crude and sometimes criminal behavior, and the illegal narcotics industry - much of it based in poor areas.None of those things were mentioned by the president.The cold truth is there has been a failure to lead on culture and family issues, and that has led to bad behavior being excused and sometimes even accepted.American society has grown so permissive and politically correct that solving poverty is almost impossible now.Anyone who raises questions about so-called ""entertainment"" that instructs children to reject civil behavior is immediately attacked in vile ways.  Anyone lamenting the African-American out-of-wedlock birthrate risks being branded a racist.I know for a fact that Mr. Obama understands and is appalled by the culture swamp.  Why then isn't he attacking it?As for schools, we continue to pour record amounts of money into public education but nothing gets better.Why?  Because the system refuses to provide discipline, direction or competition through school vouchers for the poor.That's why!Third point:OBAMA: ""We cannot be ignorant of history. (Applause.) We can't meet the world with a sense of entitlement.  We can't walk by a homeless man without asking why a society as wealthy as ours allows that state of affairs to occur.  We can't just lock up a low-level dealer without asking why this boy, barely out of childhood, felt he had no other options.""Right out of the progressive playbook.  No other options but to sell drugs?  Come on.What an insult to the millions of young people of all colors working their butts off in fast food joints all across the country, or other entry level jobs - kids trying to build a resume of hard work, not taking the immoral, lazy way out by committing crimes on the street corner.As for the homeless, there is usually a reason and many times it's personal self-destruction that no free society can prevent.China often isolates people who refuse to be responsible but we in America don't do that, even in cases of acute mental illness.Individual rights trump dysfunction in our county, thus the homeless problem.Finally the fourth point:OBAMA: ""It's thanks in large part to the activism of young people like many of you, from Black Twitter to Black Lives Matter, that America's eyes have been opened -- white, black, Democrat, Republican -- to the real problems, for example, in our criminal justice system.  But to bring about structural change, lasting change, awareness is not enough.""Big mistake - and rhetoric that is driving the Trump vote.Black Lives Matter is a radical group that has little use for free speech, as both Bernie Sanders and the Clintons have found out:SANDERS: ""Thank you Seattle for being one of the most progressive cities in the United States of America!"" (Black Lives Matter protesters take the stage)((EDIT))PROTESTER TO SANDERS: ""If you do not listen to her your event will be shut down right now!""((EDIT))HILLARY CLINTON: ""I think we've got somebody saying here -""PROTESTER: ""We want you to apologize for mass incarceration.""HILLARY CLINTON:  ""Ok we'll talk about ...""PROTESTER: ""I'm not a super predator Hillary Clinton,""HILLARY CLINTON: ""Okay fine, we'll talk about it.""PROTESTER: ""Will you apologize to black people for mass incarceration?""((EDIT))BILL CLINTON: ""You are defending the people who kill the people whose lives you say matter.  Tell the truth.  You are defending the people who cause young people to go out and take guns.""Most Americans are appalled at intrusions like that, not to mention insanity like this: August protests in MinnesotaBLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTERS: ""Pigs in a blanket! Fry 'em like bacon!""President Obama's support of Black Lives Matter indirectly tells college graduates that radical intrusions are acceptable.That, of course, creates an enormous wedge between his supporters and more traditional Americans - again fueling the rise of a candidate like Donald Trump.Ironically, earlier in the speech, the president chastised those who disinvite certain people to college campuses, saying all responsible voices deserve to be heard.  So what about the Black Lives Matter shout downs, Mr. President?The truth is some reforms need to be made on the justice, racial and social fronts, but the core issues of poverty and injustice are not being addressed effectively because of politics and P.C. out of control.Until those in power stop pandering and begin developing tough, fair-to-all policies, the growing divide in America will keep growing.Voters who support Trump are sending a powerful message that President Obama and the young Americans who revere him should seriously think about.These are the words that truly matter - equal justice for all.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

9	9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/05/04/mark-cuban-dont-know-who-will-vote-for-at-this-time/	Mark Cuban: I don't know who I will vote for at this time	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" May 4, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Wait a minute. Did the shark just jump the tank, Mark Cuban talking politics with me on FBN?Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MARK CUBAN, CO-FOUNDER, HDNET: I think it's great.I mean, I was an anybody-but-Cruz guy. I like Donald. I think it just shows how tribal the United States has become. I don't even think we are partisan anymore. I think we are tribal. And Donald has got that whole what about me tribe running behind him, and he's excited them to come out and vote for him.And it's going to make for an interesting election.CAVUTO: Everyone seems to be saying, at least on the left, Mark, that he's going to be dead meat, that he's going to get annihilated. Even Republicans are saying they fear not only will he go down to a blazing defeat, the Senate will go down as well, that big.What do you say?CUBAN: No, not at all. I think he's got a shot.Now, I'm not here to handicap it and say it's a sure thing by a long shot.  But I think what has happened is, for a while, people got turned on to the Tea Party. And they were asking, OK, what about me? What can you do for me? And the Tea Party stood up, the conservatives that stood up and they said, we think we can take care of you.That fell apart. And so Donald recognized early on that, look, it's not about issues at all. A lot of people could care less. All they care about is, what are you going to do for me? And Donald addressed immigration. He addressed trade. He addressed all these things.No substance whatsoever, but he said to people who were concerned about themselves, I can fix it. I can fix it.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: But is that good enough, Mark? Eventually, you have to spell out your plan, right?(CROSSTALK)CUBAN: No. I don't think you do. Uh-uh.CAVUTO: OK. That's interesting.CUBAN: This is going to be the -- Donald Trump is going to run the Seinfeld campaign. It's going to be the campaign about nothing. And I think...CAVUTO: And you're OK with that?CUBAN: It is what it is. It's not a question of whether or not I'm OK with it.CAVUTO: All right. Will you support him?CUBAN: I don't know who I'm going to vote for yet at this point in time.  I want to see it play out. There's no reason to make a decision now.There's things I like about...CAVUTO: Well, you have been very frank in the beginning. You have had your tussles with Trump.And I...CUBAN: Sure.CAVUTO: But when is the last time you talked to him?CUBAN: Probably about three weeks ago.CAVUTO: Really? And what...CUBAN: Yes.CAVUTO: Do you mind? What was -- what were you talking about?CUBAN: Yes, we just -- various things. Donald is a sports fan. And he will -- when the Mavs have a big win or whatever -- actually, it was two weeks ago.CAVUTO: OK.CUBAN: When the Mavs have a big week, a big win, or something, he will call and congratulate me. And we will talk about some things.And I tell him, I don't support a lot of his policies, but I like the way he's energized people. And I really think he tapped into the fact that this is not about issues anymore. There are people out there that want to know, what are you going to do for them? They don't trust government.And if they already know the government is not going to do what they need to help them get jobs or to help protect them, then let's turn to somebody who may not get into any detail whatsoever, but at least they will -- it sounds like he's going to try to answer the what about me question.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Go ahead.CUBAN: And, like I said, it's going to be a Seinfeld campaign, the campaign about nothing, because the more Donald talks about the issues, the more it plays right into the hands of Hillary and the more the eyes of his what about me tribe glasses -- glazes over.They don't pay attention to it. And I think he picked up on that early on.  And that was brilliant by him.CAVUTO: You know, you're a maverick in your own -- no pun intended with your team -- but you have to get deals done, right? You have to keep moving...CUBAN: Yes.CAVUTO: I can't believe I'm saying all these cliches -- the ball forward.Now, the rap against Donald Trump is successful businessman, but they are going to throw that back in his face, saying, wait a minute, you're not that successful. First of all, we don't buy how rich you are. Secondly, we're not quite sure, given your bankruptcy filing, that everything you say is what you say.Now, he's weathered that within the Republican primaries and taken out 16 of the most incredible set of candidates we have ever seen.CUBAN: That's so easy to overcome.CAVUTO: Is that a big deal?CUBAN: No.CAVUTO: Is he going to have to address that?CUBAN: No.The American dream is not about how many times you fail. You don't even know how many times I have failed, Neil. Every great entrepreneur has failed. Thomas Edison talks about all the 50,000 times he has failed led to the time he succeeded.We accept entrepreneurial failure, because it just shows he got back up and ended up getting it done and being successful. Now, you can argue on the margin how much, but does it really matter? It really doesn't.CAVUTO: No, I actually agree with that. I think it's safe to say the guy is rich.CUBAN: Yes.CAVUTO: We will leave it at that.But, Mark, are you surprised, as a fairly wealthy guy in your own right, that Donald Trump has tapped a nerve with what Democrats have disparagingly flannel flyover country with the common man, with the coal miners...CUBAN: No.  (CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: ... with regular workers?Explain that.CUBAN: OK.Like I was saying earlier, we are in a what about me time. If you look at Bernie Sanders, the what about me are the millennials sticking together.  They are very tribal. I keep on going back to that word as well.CAVUTO: Right.CUBAN: The millennials didn't care about Bernie Sanders. They cared about the fact that all the other millennials supported him and they were part of the crew and they could identify. It's like supporting a basketball team.Mavericks fans hates fans of so-and-so. Just look at Twitter to see how tribal and how bad it is out there. So, when Donald -- what Donald realized early on, look, he looked -- I think he looked at how the Republicans treated Hillary, she's a criminal, she's a liar, whatever you want to call her, every name in the book.So, that said, you know, it wasn't about issues. We can -- I can call anybody anything and not deal with issues as long as I can get people excited. And that's exactly what he did.He got people who are saying, you know what? I'm tired of government as usual. I'm tired of politicians as -- business as usual. I have trusted them, I have voted for them, and it makes no difference. They did nothing for me. I'm struggling for a job. I haven't really had wage increases.They are not -- that Middle America is not going to look at Donald Trump and say, wow, what about his policies, any more than I care what type of play the Dallas Cowboys run or what the play we ran to get Dirk a shot. We just want to know, did we win or lose and will we win or lose?And so Middle America like that is saying, you know what? I would rather trust him, because everything that's happened with traditional politics, traditional government has been a failure when it comes to, what is in it for me? And so let's go with Donald.As far as opposing Hillary, it is going to come down to who turns out the vote. If he can continue to say, look, I'm going to make your life better, I'm going to stop trade, I'm going to build a wall, I'm going to impact immigration, so people don't take your jobs, then he's got -- if he can get people out, he's got a real chance. And none of that has to -- has to do anything at all with actual issues or supporting information.CAVUTO: But would he have to change his demeanor? You always hear he curses at people. He's trying to get the people he beat to join him now.CUBAN: Yes.CAVUTO: But it is hard if you call the guy little Marco or lyin' Ted Cruz or all this stuff. And he has to get them back. Now, he's been very presidential since.CUBAN: No, it doesn't matter.  (CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: It doesn't matter.(CROSSTALK)CUBAN: No.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: What do you after you vanquish someone, or you conquer someone and take their business and we will bring it to the next level or outcompete them? I mean, how do you either bring them into the fold or calm frayed nerves or...CUBAN: You just do. You just do.Look, Donald and I have had our battles. People talk about Donald being sexist. There's nothing he has said about a woman that he hasn't said to me. He's called me ugly. He's called short off the tee. He's called me all these ridiculous things, right?(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: Right.CUBAN: And that is just how he combats it.And I think what a lot of people fail to realize is, look at every condemnation of Hillary Clinton to date, right? It's she's lying, she's a criminal. It's all about name-calling.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: So do you think the debates will be reduced to that?CUBAN: I think it depends on Hillary's strategy. if Hillary tries to force him into policy issues, then it won't work, right? He will just talk about that.CAVUTO: Because he will go another way.CUBAN: He will go another way. Right.CAVUTO: Right.CUBAN: He's got to have the Seinfeld campaign to campaign about nothing, because...CAVUTO: That's interesting.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: What about the environment? Does it make a difference with the economy, Mark? There are a lot of people -- you're closer to this than I will ever be -- who say the economy could be hiccupping. We could be looking at global slowdown. Would that -- how would a Donald Trump handle that?I would imagine, given his business credentials, he might say, I'm the guy to deal with a bubble bursting or an economy in a recovery.(CROSSTALK)CUBAN: He's just going to blame -- he's just going to blame Obama.Whatever it is, it's Obama's fault, right? He will not touch -- my guess is, he will not touch on the details whatsoever, because there's no upside for him, because there's so much -- they have done such a great job on the right just putting down Hillary so that it is anybody but Hillary.I mean, look, Cruz was anybody but Hillary. I can beat Hillary. Kasich, I can beat Hillary.CAVUTO: You didn't like Cruz. Why not?CUBAN: Because he was a -- he was dogmatic. He was full of crap on his programs.I will give you one perfect example on details. He wanted to change to a value-added tax, but more importantly, he want to eliminate the IRS day one. Right? That was one of his pillars.CAVUTO: Right.CUBAN: That would be -- that is 90,000 people. That would be the largest layoff in the history of the world on day one.Yet, on the flip side, he says, we're going to go out, and because we're cutting taxes, every job -- every graduate is going to have not two, not three, three, four or five job offers. It was just as crazy as you can imagine.CAVUTO: So, you were not a big fan of his.Do you think it's important -- does a guy like you pay attention to who a candidate picks as his or her running mate?CUBAN: Yes, it depends if there's balance, right?CAVUTO: So, for Donald Trump, to Mark Cuban, who would that balance be?CUBAN: For me, I would tell him to pick a politician, that Paul Ryan is not going to do it. John Boehner would be great, but I don't know enough of the details and I don't know enough about the intricacies...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: I assume you would not like to see Ted Cruz.CUBAN: No.(LAUGHTER)CUBAN: And I know Donald wouldn't either.I don't think Donald really...CAVUTO: So if you had your choice now, Mark, between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, where would you go?CUBAN: I don't know yet.CAVUTO: Really?CUBAN: That's the honest answer. Yes, I really don't know yet.I think there's things that are positive about Donald. I think there's things that are positive about Hillary, and the same with the negative side.CAVUTO: Interesting.CUBAN: Yes, I think there's a lot of basketball to be played yet.And it's going to be really interesting how Hillary responds to Donald.CAVUTO: Interesting.CUBAN: If Hillary stays Hillary, I think it really hurts her and really helps Donald.CAVUTO: Interesting.CUBAN: If Hillary can really make it tough on Donald to just do the Seinfeld campaign, then I think she's got a better chance.(END VIDEOTAPE)CAVUTO: A campaign about nothing. Think about that. It's been a weird year, right?  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
