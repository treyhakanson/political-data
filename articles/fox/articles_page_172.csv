 Senator Playing Politics with Bin Laden Killing? 
"	"And now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:Playing Politics?Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson is being accused of playing politics with the bin Laden killing.Politico reports Nelson, who is running for re-election next year, tied the U.S. operation in Pakistan to his stance against a bill that he says would make it more difficult to cast early ballots. After referencing 9/11 Nelson said -- quote -- ""We find ourselves gathered in our capital city of this state again here to protect our democracy... to keep the right to vote.""The Republican Senate president who is challenging Nelson for U.S. Senate says Nelson stooped to a new low for -- quote -- ""Comparing pending legislation to a terrorist organization that has killed thousands of people.""Close ShaveA middle school teacher from Washington state was relieved to learn of bin Laden's death not just for the obvious reasons, but because he vowed after the 9/11 attacks that he would not shave his beard until bin Laden was caught or killed.Gary Weddle told his students every year the beard was a reminder of the attacks and it made him look a little like bin Laden. So he wasted no time Sunday. The beard was gone by the time President Obama addressed the nation.Puttering AroundAnd finally, prospective Republican presidential candidate and businessman Donald Trump has been trumped in the headlines by the UBL raid. But Trump is raising some eyebrows for comparing his opposition to legalizing same-sex marriage to his reluctance to use a new kind of putter.He told The New York Times Sunday -- quote -- ""It's like in golf... I don't want this to sound trivial, but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters because they can't sink three-footers anymore. And I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist."""
