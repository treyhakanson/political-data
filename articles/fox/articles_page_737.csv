This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld, it's 5 o'clock in New York City and in Cleveland at the site of the Republican National Convention and this is ""The Five."" Welcome, everybody. Chaos on day one of the Republican National Convention, an uproar on the floor over delegates, just moments ago. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All those in favor say aye, all those opposed no. And the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it and the resolution is agreed to. Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Campaign Carl Cameron is here with us to explain exactly what's going on. Now Carl, I understand, seven states could have forced the vote. They got nine. What happened?CARL CAMERON, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, great political theater, tremendously entertaining and very, very disturbing for republicans to have this happen on the first day. There was an attempt by the never-Trumpers, the stop-Trumpers, the anti-Trump forces to get a roll call vote on the floor. And what they were trying to do was having obtained a majority of the delegates in seven states, the requirement to bring a motion to the floor from the minority of the rules committee they wanted a roll call vote and they thought that if everybody will raised their hands and be counted that there was a possibility that they could actually get it to pass. They didn't. They got, as you saw there on that video, dramatic as it was, they got instead of voice vote and that leaves it up to the chair to decide who yell louder in that convention center of thousands and thousands of people. And the chair's determination was that the nays have it, that the never- Trumpers get stopped in their tracks, notwithstanding their beliefs that by having a majority of the delegates in seven states. In one case, Mike Lee, the senator from Utah said that they 11 states worth of majorities, others said it was closer to nine. But they did top it and because they got a voice vote they were literally shouted down. And in addition to what we saw there on the screen a little while ago, Ken Cuccinelli, the former attorney general from Virginia and a very strong Cruz supporter ripped off his credentials, threw them on the ground and stormed out. It gives you an idea that there's not entire unity here because of the dissent against Trump, but they were shouted down, voice-voted down, and there aren't a lot of other options left.BOLLING: We're going to bring around Carl, but is that it? Was that the final straw to the never-Trump camel?CAMERON: There really isn't an alternative.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Until November?CAMERON: The minority report has been now struck down twice. There's really no other way to get back there. And as a consequence, it's now Trump's to win. And the idea that anybody -- and the other thing is, even with all of this maneuvering with the rules, there isn't anybody waiting there to step up.PERINO: Right.CAMERON: There isn't an alternative that the convention has been made aware of to step forward, so this becomes a defeat for the never-Trumpers, a victory for the RNC and for Donald Trump and an uprising that frankly, they thought they had already put down and rose again today and that's the chaos, that's the confusion and the disappointment.PERINO: So somebody that was on the floor for Kentucky sent me a note saying that -- obviously, Kentucky wasn't part of any of those states that were never-Trump, but he said that Senator Mike Lee of Utah has a point that at least the RNC could provide an explanation as how that voice vote decision happened, because I don't think -- to me this is seems like a family that has a bunch of issues that they've never talked about and now it's thanksgiving dinner and everyone is mad. And on ""The Wall Street Journal"" poll on Sunday that came out, Wall Street Journal/NBC, 60 percent of republicans or lean republicans said they would have preferred someone else as the nominee. So from the RNC standpoint, yes, victory tonight in a way, but how do they then explain to these people that are so mad -- what happened?CAMERON: Well, they probably don't explain it to them. And that's sort of why they made a voice vote and closed it all down. They don't have to explain it. The RNC makes its own rules, they bend their own rules. Donald Trump is not wrong when he says that these systems are occasionally rigged. They're rigged to win.PERINO: But yeah, but he said they were rigged against him before. Now they're rigged in his favor?CAMERON: But they're rigged in his favor, they're rigged to win, they're rigged try to quell .PERINO: Yeah.CAMERON: . this type of dissent. Clearly, it didn't quell the dissent, but it did quell the motion.PERINO: Right.BOLLING: Anybody?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah, I just have a question. I mean where, where does it go from here? I mean basically, this is opening night. We're going to hear, I guess, from Melania Trump. And we know what time that's going to happen and kind of aback about that, right.CAMERON: After this melee is tamped down and it's going to take some hand shaking and some arm twisting, then things will begin to sort of move much more normally. We will see Mrs. Trump tonight. We also see two people who are on the shortlist, Lieutenant General Mike Flynn and Senator Joni Ernst. Tonight is about make America safe again. So we're going to hear as lot about law and order, we're going to hear a lot about terrorism overseas, we're going to see it here, a lot about domestic violence particularly involving police officers and the kind of violence we've been seeing. So that's what tonight is supposed to be about, not the political violence that the never-Trumpers were visited, had visited upon them this afternoon.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: So Carl, let's go behind the scenes on this. One is obviously the iron hand of Reince Priebus saying, ""Hey, this is what I wanted set up. I thought I had dealt with it before, it's now --""CAMERON: That maybe the first time anybody has ever said that Reince Priebus has an iron hand.WILLIAMS: I know. Exactly, that's pretty good, but --GUILFOYLE: He's probably like that.WILLIAMS: Because I noticed today was Paul Manafort going after the governor of Ohio and saying, ""Hey, what's going on here? What kind of loyalty are we seeing from the governor of Ohio, alienating the Governor Kasich?"" But secondly, a lot of talk about whether or not, Ted Cruz, another potential opponent, would have the opportunity to speak at the convention.CAMERON: So the understanding was, that in order to get a speaking slot at this convention, you had to endorse Donald Trump. Ted Cruz was promised a speaking slot, said he would take it even though he has yet to do so. Part of the negotiation about whether he gets his slot fill and actually gets to speak is whether or not the content of his speech will include something like an endorsement if not an actual.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: Yes.CAMERON: And Cruz is sort of hedging on that. So it's a negotiation still under way. Again, this is the sort of stuff that usually happens in the smoke-filled back rooms. Today it was right there on the auditorium floor where there's no smoke. You got to see.WILLIAMS: Well, I think a lot of people might say, oh you know, Juan is the demagogue. He says he's kind of enjoying this. But in fact, I think it's very interesting that in a populist year, you see the populism comes to the fore and it's being squelched, absolutely stepped on.CAMERON: Well, the populism this time around comes more from the establishment republicans.WILLIAMS: Yeah.CAMERON: The populism throughout this campaign has been believed to be in Donald Trump's supporters. Donald Trump supporters are going to go bananas if there is some sort of a parliamentary rule .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.CAMERON: . or some sort of a rule massage at the last second that pulls the rug out from under them. And the truth is the RNC has been from the outset saying, there are plenty of ways that this will be stopped. There was a rumor, at one point today, that after the never-Trumpers had gotten their more than seven-state majorities, that they couldn't find the secretary to actually show them the signatures and I got to tell you .WILLIAMS: Very convenient.CAMERON: . as far back as the debate that took place in Miami in March, there were -- RNC people saying, you know some of the delegates may just not be able to leave their hotel rooms that day and come vote. Some of them may decide that they go on a fieldtrip and just leave the compound all together, in order to not vote. So, there's a lots of ways that this was going to get gamed. In the end it happened from the podium.BOLLING: All right, Greg.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah, to me, I mean this is disturbing in a sense that we, we keep hearings like how important unity is. We've also been told by Trump that he doesn't need a lot of these people. So my feeling is I don't think this is over. I don't think it's over by a long shot. I think it's like the walking dead. It's going to come back. I have a question for you. When he picked Pence, did that tickle the preppers?(LAUGHTER)CAMERON: Yes, and it ends the suspence .GUTFELD: Yes.CAMERON: . and the tuppence (ph) for me and the tuppence (ph) for you. It goes on -- the jokes and the quips about how that happened will continue, probably all the way through this election.GUTFELD: Right.CAMERON: This was not a very smooth rollout.GUTFELD: It looked like an arranged marriage from the Middle East country. And there were the angry men that were demanding it and the women on the other side saying, please don't do it.CAMERON: You don't have to go back to far to remember when Sarah Palin was picked as a McCain running mate. That was considered a chaotic rollout. This one may not have been and quite is dramatic and the sweeping landscapes weren't quite as gorgeous, but the bare knuckle stuff was one of the more chaotic rollouts for any presidential/vice presidential nominee ticket.GUTFELD: It's hard for -- like on the 60 minutes segment to be in a two- person interview to be -- to look confident because the guy's in charge. You have to sit there. You're like a concubine in the headlights. You know, you're just sitting there. It just didn't look that attractive.CAMERON: They're not all that well-familiar with each another. They know one another's records, they've been put -- of course, Pence was a Cruz guy himself, for the longest time.GUTFELD: Yeah.CAMERON: So there's a little bit of tension that sort to build into this. And the other aspect to it is Trump is a master of bringing himself attention. He's not accustomed to sharing it with anybody.PERINO: Right.CAMERON: He's happy to do it with his wife and his kids in the convention here.PERINO: They have the same last name.CAMERON: At the rollout, at the rollout the other day in New York .(CROSSTALK)CAMERON: . Trump spoke for 45 minutes, Pence spoke for four. I mean it was --PERINO: Well, it is a vice presidential role. I mean, you don't like, you're not like front and center.CAMERON: Sure. They had the chance to --PERINO: Can I ask you on one more question about the -- three of the states that were asking for this roll call vote; Iowa, Virginia and Colorado, arguably three states that Donald trump needs to win in November, unless we've got another path to 270 electoral votes. What will the campaign do to sort of deal with them, because the people that are complaining today are party activists.CAMERON: Well, Virginia's tough. And Cuccinelli has said -- and he's obviously a Virginia republican and has run for a variety of offices and been around for a long time, he's deeply concerned that Trump might lose that state.GUILFOYLE: Right.CAMERON: Iowa is also a swing state, and it's the same sort of a problem there. Trump didn't win the Iowa caucuses. You know, he started with a loss in the caucuses. And Colorado is incredibly important swing states. And (inaudible), the delegate and the chairman of their delegation is one of the never-Trump pushers. So there's animus there. It is not the case in a handful of other swing states. And, of course, Trump has his safely red and Hillary will have her safely blue.PERINO: Right.CAMERON: On the Electoral College map right now, things seem to be tilted towards Clinton, but we're just getting started here.PERINO: Yes.CAMERON: I mean granted --PERINO: Trump could get a pretty decent bump out of this convention.CAMERON: They've both -- both candidates, both Hillary and Trump have had plenty of time to start and get things ready to go, but they really can't, really hit the gas until after the convention. Now we're finally almost there.BOLLING: Carl, we gonna have to let you go in just a second. We have one quick comment of, just tell me that it's not as bad as it seems. I've been there on the floor in 2012 when there was a roll, there was a vote, a vocal vote and the ayes were aye and the nays were nay, but the ayes held. And I was there again today when the same thing happened. Politics as usual, continues or what?CAMERON: Well, this time around it was to the potential aid and help of Ted Cruz. The last time we had this type of an uproar was when Ron Paul .BOLLING: Yeah, yeah.CAMERON: . was protesting not having been allotted the delegates that he thought he had in Iowa. And by acclamation --GUTFELD: What did they use the system, it's fully efficient.CAMERON: At the end of this, there will be a vote to make the nomination by acclamation.GUTFELD: Right.CAMERON: You're going to hear a lot of people say no. You're going to hear the chairmen say, the ayes have it. It's by acclamation.GUTFELD: Right, because when you go to the airport, you can now order food with a button, you know at LaGuardia. Why can't people just punch buttons?BOLLING: Or order their nominee with buttons.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Order their nominee with --BOLLING: All right.PERINO: Swipe right, swipe left.BOLLING: We got to let Carl go because he's headed back over the -- to the Q, they call it the Q, the Quicken Arena.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Much more to come ahead on day one of the Republican National Convention. Stay around. More behind the scenes video from our road trip this weekend. Stay with us, please.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: It's day one of the convention and the topic is security. Recent months have been a game of ping-pong between Islamism and attacks on police. One week it's Orlando, another it's Dallas, then France, then Baton Rouge. Terror and attacks on police share a common desire to dismantle civilization. For the Islamists, it's about ending the world because the next one is going to be so much better for them. For the haters of police, it's about creating warring tribes to rot a country from within.We face external and internal threats. How can America survive that? The next president must be able to nail that question.He or she must prioritize threats knowing that fossil fuels are way nicer than ISIS and that transgendered bathrooms must take a backseat to killing jihadists.This leader must understand that terror changes more so than climate, as technology creates new avenues at a breathless pace. It won't be just trucks and guns -- add drones, phones and bio-agents. And safety won't be achieved through the coddling of identity hucksters demanding protection from the loathsome behavior they encourage.So as we focus on safety, ask yourself this: Who among our choices exhibit the temperament, the drive and attention span need to focus on security? And who will listen to those who know the threat? Because more of the same is not an option and, frankly, one of our options could be really worse.So KG .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: . tonight's theme, make America safe again, strongly implies -- maybe it's not that safe, but it's a good place to start?GUILFOYLE: I think it is a good place to start. People can relate to that, the law and order brand to say, this is a country that we need to restore public safety and security. And it really couples nicely with the whole idea of national security, foreign policy, a strong military being able to defend our country and leadership that is going to make great choices. When you think about the aftermath even of just the past week in 10 days of what's gone on in this country and what's gone overseas. People don't necessary have a tremendous amount of confidence.GUTFELD: Right.GUILFOYLE: They are less actually thirsting for some kind of strength and someone to focus on that as a priority and, unfortunately for Hillary Clinton, she's been woefully absent and late on responses and not really engendering that much confidence from those that are looking for a different kind of leadership.GUTFELD: You know, Juan, it seems like the events that are happening are dictating the vote. And to Kimberly's point, Trump was already there talking about this stuff and Hillary has been lagging way far behind. And I think she's trying to catch up, but it doesn't seem like it's happening.WILLIAMS: Well, actually, you know, I thought after Orlando, I thought it would play to Trump's benefit, the law and order theme. But he just bumbled the whole thing way trying to tell people, oh, yeah, as I told you I predicted this and then sort of gloating about it. And I think it really turned off a lot of people. So I'm not sure he knows how to handle it. In this situation that what we've seen, the horrific occurrences in Baton Rouge, he talks about the nation as a divided crime scene.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: He says Obama doesn't have a clue, as if he didn't hear what President Obama had to say yesterday about there being no excuse for violence against law enforcement in this country. So, it's, you know, it's so interesting to me. It's almost as if he's playing to a specific segment, but I think that segment was already going to vote for Donald Trump, and then he ignores the idea that, hey, you know what, I look at these statistics, black people 2 1/2 times as likely as white people to be shot and killed by the police?GUTFELD: Who accuse them, though?WILLIAMS: The police?GUTFELD: Yeah, black and Hispanic officers are more likely than white officers.WILLIAMS: It's true. I'm just saying the police. And what we've got here is the problem. One of the officers killed yesterday, Greg, was a black policeman.GUTFELD: Right.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Talk about not being loved in Baton Rouge .GUTFELD: Very true, very true.WILLIAMS: . even when he was out of uniform saying, he was viewed as a threat. The other thing I was going to tell you was, that of unarmed people shot and killed in 2015, 40 percent black men who are just as you know, 6 percent of the population. So what you see is that --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: That's a legitimate crime statistics.BOLLING: Did you use any crime statistics there in those, put those numbers up against the amount of crimes being perpetrated by African-Americans?WILLIAMS: Oh, sure. Yeah, I mean, is this disproportionate?BOLLING: And so -- but the rate isn't as disproportionate as you're making it out to seem --WILLIAMS: No, it is.BOLLING: No, they're not.WILLIAMS: Because when they factor in --BOLLING: Because African-Americans are committing crime at a much higher rate --WILLIAMS: That has been -- again, that's not related. So you can say there's more crime in the black community.BOLLING: But the police shooting people who are committing crime, it's more white people?WILLIAMS: No, no, no. You have unarmed people.BOLLING: It's math, it just straight math.WILLIAMS: Let me just reiterate to you. It was unarmed people shot and killed --BOLLING: You don't have to be armed to perpetrate a crime, Juan.WILLIAMS: But you -- what I'm saying is --BOLLING: You can still rape someone without a gun.WILLIAMS: I don't think --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: This is not -- this is not related (inaudible).(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Quick.GUTFELD: Yes, go.PERINO: Well, when we were talking about security -- as of 2004, in that election, George W. Bush was running for re-election and was able to talk to, when he be called, security moms. OK? In this election, I feel like there's not -- this is just me talking. I haven't. There's not a specific name for them. But given the anxiety in the country, I think you could call them insecurity moms or insecure moms. And it's not just national security; it is law enforcement and also the economy. So I don't know if that's the best phrase to describe them, but I think that way you'll see tonight and then on the night we're going to talk about the economy here, they're trying to form a message to try to talk to both moms to say, it will be-- you'll be more secure under a Trump administration than you would be a Clinton administration. I think they have a little bit of a higher bar to clear, but I think that you're right. People don't want more of the same from the last few years.GUTFELD: Yes. And I think that's what --GUILFOYLE: Concerned moms. Yeah.BOLLING: Can I just throwing that out very quickly, I think you're 100 percent right that Donald Trump had that space staked out prior to the last couple of shootings. And if you remember, after San Bernardino and after Orlando, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton brought up the gun debate. And that's not sitting well with American trade.GUTFELD: No.BOLLING: Right now, Americans want more safety not fewer guns to protect themselves.WILLIAMS: Well, I just wonder if people are going to say, hmm, who is -- which candidate is going to actually reduce racial tensions, reduce (inaudible) --BOLLING: Whoa, whoa, whoa.WILLIAMS: . in the country.BOLLING: It wasn't --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It wasn't the first black president. It wasn't the first black president.WILLIAMS: What are you talking about?BOLLING: The racial divide is wider now than was --WILLIAMS: Oh, I think it was higher levels of people saying they think race relations are worsening. And I don't know the thing that's --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Well, who is -- and that's under a black president.GUTFELD: You guys disagreed. Donald Trump will be making and roll that whatever you want me to say, making an early appearance at the RNC tonight when he introduces his wife Melania. He gave Fox News a preview of her speech. You'll hear that ahead. (inaudible) oh yeah, a road trip to the convention. I'm on a camel there. Going to see more of that camel riding stuff, stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Welcome back. The Republican National Convention is underway here in Cleveland. Donald Trump's big moment doesn't arrive until Thursday, but delegates won't have to wait that long to see him. He'll be introducing his wife Melania tonight. The presumptive GOP nominee gave ""Fox & Friends"" a preview of what we can expect to hear.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE GOP NOMINEE: She is going to be speaking about her love of the country. And don't forget, she came into the country. She worked hard. She came into the country. She gained legal status, as the expression goes, and she's a terrific person and a terrific woman. And she is going to -- I'll bet she gives a great speech. She's worked hard on it. I will be there. I want to watch. It's going to be very exciting.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. So this is obviously going to be a big moment because, number one, you get to see the republican nominee, and number two, you get to hear from his very sweet, lovely wife Melania. What do you think about this moment, Dana?PERINO: Well, I think she is certainly number one in his eyes, and several months ago .GUTFELD: Wow.PERINO: . I've read an article -- what do you mean by that? I read an article in ""Harper's Bazaar"" several months ago is the feature story about her and about -- she spoke briefly about what was it like when he asked her, talked to her about wanting to run for the presidency. And the article is really good. I encourage people to check it out before the speech. And I like it when she turned to him and she said, you know, ""I'll be there."" It's like you understand that if you run, you're going to win. And she's been there with him. She's kind of been behind the scenes but always behind the scenes like in a very supportive role. I give a lot of deference to any spouse that can get up and give a speech like this. I think she'll be really charming tonight.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. And, you know, Greg, I know her, for, you know, many years. I've met her before. She's very warm. And I think the more people get know her and, you know, have an experience with her and be get the exposure, they're going to really like her. You know, I think that's an asset for him.GUTFELD: Yeah, I mean, I met her once. She seemed like a very pleasant woman. And I do like the fact that she gets upset with Donald about certain things and tells him -- I think there was something she was upset about with --PERINO: Tweeting.GUTFELD: Tweeting. She was trying to -- just like my wife. She says like, get off the Twitter for God sakes. Talk to real people. But it's interesting like how this convention is. It's going to be like ""The Osmonds."" Remember that TV show in the '70s, except it's Osmonds with politicians. The entire Trump family, we will see them every single night. It will be like Donny and Marie and Wayne and everybody -- maybe they'll do a dance number.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Well, I think that's a good thing. You know, in this --GUILFOYLE: Very likable family.BOLLING: You watch Donald and -- you watch Donald when Melania is talking, when they're doing an interview together. And he really pays attention to her. It's not like he's worried about what she'll going to say. He just -- he loves her. You can see he loves her.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: And, when the kids talk, it's just, it's amazing. They talk so highly of their father. I know it's their father, and it's a family. You have to say hats off to the guy who can raise kids like that who love him the way they do, and a wife who respects and enjoys him and shares everything with him, and he respects her back. It seems like a great relationship all the way around.GUILFOYLE: All right, Juan, what do you think? I mean, it's nice to have, you know, the family members, the boys have certainly been very good on his behalf. We'll hear from Ivanka, too, later in the week, I believe. So an asset for him?WILLIAMS: I was wondering about this, because I think she's lovely. I mean, boy, you know, I know it's not the politically correct thing to say, but she is a beautiful woman.GUTFELD: Juan!WILLIAMS: Yes, I know.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.WILLIAMS: So I think -- I think...BOLLING: Microaggression...WILLIAMS: There we go.BOLLING: ... against the ladies on the table.WILLIAMS: I know, OK. You know, but I wonder how America reacts to the accent. She has not spoken much. I think the one time I heard her speak was in Milwaukee.BOLLING: Microaggression, too.WILLIAMS: Was in Milwaukee. And she -- you know, I was looking forward to, you know, OK, so what I this, you know, running mate going to look like, going to say? And basically, she said, you know, he's a kind man. He's a smart man. He's a tough man. He's a great man.GUILFOYLE: He's good for women.WILLIAMS: So it's like a character witness. Yes.GUILFOYLE: She said that he was good for women.WILLIAMS: Yes. But it was very short. But it struck me as a character witness.PERINO: But she doesn't seek the limelight. And I think that America might like that.WILLIAMS: But that's not traditional. See, I don't think...PERINO: That's not true.WILLIAMS: Unlike the Bush -- unlike the Bush wives, who I think were pushing forward in terms of what the woman's role is, or even Michelle Obama, you haven't heard what is it that would be the cause that Melania Trump would...PERINO: She'll come to one.GUTFELD: You've got to -- the accent thing, she's going to be -- she has to be cognizant of that. You've got to -- that you have to support somebody who does that, because it's hard to speak. I mean, she's in a difficult position. So you've got to give her credit.GUILFOYLE: Well, Trump and his newly-announced running mate, Mike Pence, did their first joint interview together on ""60 Minutes"" last night. Trump is confident his selection of Pence will help unite a fractured party.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)LESLEY STAHL, ""60 MINUTES"": You must have considered, obviously, by the reaction to your choice, a lot of the conservatives are very happy.DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Very happy.STAHL: Was that part of the...TRUMP: Yes. It was party unity. I'm an outsider. I'm a person that used to be establishment when I'd give them hundreds of thousands of dollars, but when I decided to run, I became very anti-establishment, because I understand the system better than anybody else.STAHL: Is he establishment?TRUMP: He's very establishment in many ways, and that's not a bad thing. But I will tell you...STAHL: Kind of interesting.TRUMP: ... I have seen more people that, frankly, did not like me so much and now they're saying, what a great pick.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. So Dana, what do you think? This is a helpful choice? And what did you think of that interview?PERINO: I think it's a fine choice. But the interview is like a little awkward for their first time together. I thought the setting was strange. I would have done it -- I would have done it somewhere...GUTFELD: Not in Golden Square (ph)?PERINO: ... like where you want to make America great again. I mean, I would have done that.GUTFELD: Mr. Jones (ph).PERINO: But I have heard from people that I know and just listening around at the convention that, yes, people were -- maybe people were on the fence about Donald Trump, that Mike Pence gives you some confidence that it would be a good ticket.And I did think it was good when he said at one point, ""I will listen to him."" I don't know if that actually turns out to be true, but I thought that was a good thing to say.GUILFOYLE: What do you think, Greg?GUTFELD: I think that it's very hard to do an interview when you're interviewing two people. So no matter who -- no matter who is second fiddle, always...PERINO: The potted plant.GUTFELD: Yes, you just look like a potted plant. So it's like very easy to laugh at that interview, but you have to understand that they're at a disadvantage when you're doing that. When you have the guy in charge...GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: This guy's not in charge. He's always going to look kind of like, you know, the -- you know, the frightened deer in the headlights.WILLIAMS: Well, I was wondering -- I was wondering to myself, though, in that interview, exactly why is it that, even when they were on stage and he was being introduced on Saturday, it was all Trump speaking for what, 40 minutes, and then Pence for a few minutes.And then what I typically experience in politics is that the nominee and his vice-presidential selection go out for, like, three days on the hustings to be introduced. None of that. Yesterday, Trump was playing golf.GUTFELD: Better than Palin.GUILFOYLE: All right. Eric.BOLLING: So when he first announced Pence, you know, I like Newt. I just love Newt.GUTFELD: Yes, me, too.BOLLING: I think he's brilliant.GUILFOYLE: Yes. Newt's amazing.BOLLING: A lot of great ideas. He's a brilliant guy.And I was reluctant. And the more I hear Pence, the more I like him, to be honest with you. He's solid; he's stable. As Dana points out, he defers to Donald Trump. After all, Donald Trump's the nominee.GUILFOYLE: In a nice way. And Dana's pointed out before that he's very well-liked, not only as the governor but for his experience with other senators and whatnot.All right. Next, things got wild during our road trip to Cleveland this weekend. Yes, they did. We went to the Columbus Zoo before we got here yesterday. So stay tuned for the highlights from that pit stop ahead. You don't want to miss it.PERINO: A lot of lighting (ph)...GUILFOYLE: Look at the giraffe.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Bryan Adams.WILLIAMS: Welcome back. We're here in Cleveland at the Republican National Convention. We arrived yesterday after two days on the road from New York on our very cool bus.We made lots of fun stops. One of them was a visit to the Columbus Zoo. It was almost like being on safari. Here's a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WILLIAMS: We're here at the Columbus Zoo.Feeding these lovely giraffes. Maple.BOLLING: Canadian?WILLIAMS: No, not Canadian. We're in Ohio.PERINO: OK. Whoa, hi.BOLLING: Suzie is going to tell us about her baby, her favorite attraction here. Go ahead, Suzie.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's the cheetah exhibit, because people can actually see the cheetahs run here.Chasing a lure. We train her to chase the lure. And so that would be like chasing prey in Africa.BOLLING: Right.Oh!UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here she comes.WILLIAMS: Whoa!GUTFELD: Wow.One of the most exciting things you're going to see at the Columbus Zoo is when you actually get to feed the lions.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We actually are not going the feed the lions. You don't get to feed the lions when you come to the Columbus Zoo.GUTFELD: You don't get to feed the lions?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.GUILFOYLE: This is where the news segment goes terribly wrong.GUTFELD: Riding the camel. A long forgotten Motley Crue album.There we go.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sit in back.GUTFELD: OK.PERINO: It's not a bucking camel?GUTFELD: Could you watch your language, young lady?Interesting fact about camels: People think they store water in the hump, but actually it stores fat for nourishment. So in a way, when a male has a pot belly, it's the equivalent of a camel hump. So when your husband has a pot belly, go, ""Oh, he's trying to keep healthy by storing nourishment."" You guys don't know but I actually have a background in zoology just by I read a lot of stuff on the...PERINO: He wasn't only the editor of ""Men's Health."" He was the editor of ""Zoo False Facts.""WILLIAMS: There we go.GUILFOYLE: Oh my God.GUTFELD: You know what this reminds me of?PERINO: What?GUTFELD: Nothing. Because I've never done it before.PERINO: Why Eric not want to do it?GRAPHIC: Where's Eric? Taking ""Five.""GUILFOYLE: We love it. We love the Columbus Zoo.WILLIAMS: Fabulous.GUILFOYLE: I want to thank Liffi (ph) for the ride.PERINO: Thanks, Uber.GUTFELD: Yes, thank you. That's fun.Off to Cleveland.GUILFOYLE: Off to Cleveland.GUTFELD: It's down there somewhere.GUILFOYLE: RNC, here we come.BOLLING: The bus to Cleveland. What, an hour and a half?WILLIAMS: O-hio!(END VIDEOTAPE)PERINO: We made it.WILLIAMS: What is your highlight, K.G.?GUILFOYLE: So I love it. From riding the carousel with you, right, at Hersheypark to then riding the camel. I thought it was good, because I think it's a good bipartisan approach to kind of like bring people together. Especially with the Lipper (ph) along the back.BOLLING: The camel?GUILFOYLE: Yes. Exactly.GUTFELD: That was terrible. Why didn't you want to ride a camel?BOLLING: I went and got everyone coffee while you guys -- no, actually, Dana...PERINO: No, that's not true.GUILFOYLE: Lyin' Eric Bolling.BOLLING: Dana...PERINO: I came up with a...BOLLING: The ballot? The one...PERINO: I came up with the nice reason. I was thinking, well, Eric, maybe he thought it was mean to ride a camel.BOLLING: Yes.PERINO: Like you were trying to be nice to the camel. But then he said, that's not really it. So why did you?GUTFELD: Because you knew there was five and there was an odd man out.BOLLING: Yes, I just wanted you guys to have a great time.WILLIAMS: You know what I remember...GUILFOYLE: The truth is Bolling got left behind, because in a camel episode of ""The Bachelorette,"" I chose Juan.WILLIAMS: Oh, no.GUTFELD: He was attacked by a camel as a child.BOLLING: Right. I didn't get the camel rose from you or Dana, so...WILLIAMS: I think he was just being nice. That's all.PERINO: That's what I thought.WILLIAMS: That's what I thought.But let me just say, one thing I remember is that you said when you were petting the cheetah, it was a surprise to you.BOLLING: The hair. You know, they look so smooth, but it was rough. It was really rough. And you pet, and I got a handful of fur. They just shed quite a bit.GUTFELD: Mark Steyn's going to write a song about that.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh. That video.WILLIAMS: That video was one of the...GUILFOYLE: Unbelievable.GUTFELD: For anybody who doesn't really know, Mark Steyn released a whole album about cats. It's the most disturbing thing you will ever see.PERINO: We watched it on the bus.WILLIAMS: You sure did.BOLLING: We watched it last night at dinner, didn't we?GUILFOYLE: Yes. Not at dinner. We showed Juan and Raffi, yes.GUTFELD: You were so disturbed.BOLLING: I thought it was -- I thought it was a parody at first.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: But apparently, it's not.GUILFOYLE: If you're into cats, you might find it sexy.GUTFELD: Are you really into cats? You're really into cats?PERINO: Couldn't we all agree that the Columbus Zoo actually way exceeded our expectations? That place is amazing.BOLLING: Unbelievable.GUTFELD: The best zoo I've ever been at.GUILFOYLE: And the people that work there, I mean, A-plus. If anybody -- it's worth driving across state lines, put it that way.PERINO: Yes, do it.WILLIAMS: So they have lots of zoos in Ohio. I think we could say that they are well run. Just fantastic. And thank you so much to the Columbus Zoo and aquarium.Directly ahead, more fun from our exciting road trip. We'll take you inside our tour of -- get this -- the Oval Office. Well, sort of. It's Instagram's mock Oval Office here in Cleveland. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: We had an amazing time on our road trip that we've been telling you about all the way here to Cleveland. And then when we got here, we got a chance to stop by Instagram's awesome setup. It has a mock Oval Office. And it's just like the real thing, only a lot smaller.We chatted with John Tass (ph) Parker -- He's Instagram's manager of political outreach -- about the role that social media is playing not just at the conventions but the election overall. Check it out.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)PERINO: Do you think that 2016 is really the first time you've seen social media drive news content rather than the other way around?JOHN TASS PARKER, INSTAGRAM POLITICAL OUTREACH MANAGER: One thing that we are seeing is that 2016 is going to be the most visual election to date. In 2015, more photographs were captured on camera phones than in the entire analog era. And so that's changing the way that we communicate with each other and also changing the way that we experience these massive moments like the election and like conventions.WILLIAMS: So what do we know about elections around the globe? Because you just came from the Australian election.PARKER: Yes.WILLIAMS: And before that you were in France. So how do you see Instagram changing those elections?PARKER: Absolutely. So we're seeing a lot of the world leaders around the world using Instagram to be able to connect, especially with young voters, to be able to communicate with them in the same way that they communicate with their friends and with their family.GUTFELD: So do you ever imagine there will never be another boring candidate? Because a boring candidate will no longer be able to survive in this climate, thanks to you and your evil Instagram. And Facebook. I blame all of you. Plus Twitter.PARKER: So we see -- we see over 95 million photographs and videos getting posted on Instagram any day. And that's a lot of creativity. And so that's why we built this, to celebrate that kind of creativity and be able to encourage delegates and folks like yourself to come by and enjoy -- enjoy the mini Oval Office and maybe be president for a moment.GUILFOYLE: Let's talk a little bit about this convention. It's exciting. You're going to be here before you go to the Democratic convention.PARKER: Yes.GUILFOYLE: And are there any new things you want to be trying out or get anybody out there new adopters to Instagram to get involved with?PARKER: So one thing that we're seeing on Instagram is that we're seeing an increase of 150 percent in terms of consumption of video on Instagram.So a lot of people are capturing video. I'm not sure if you've seen Boomerang, which is a great, fun way to, you know, create a short video that plays forward and then plays backwards.But here at this convention we're also going to have a portrait studio backstage. Just as the speakers come off, they're going to be captured by an incredible photographer, and that's going to be posted straight onto the GOP.BOLLING: So for those of us that doesn't -- that don't know about mini space, what inspired the mini space? Who created this?PARKER: This was just we wanted to find a way to be able to help people express themselves. And so we built this to be able to help them just, you know, have a little bit of fun and be able to showcase a little bit of a lighter side of the...GUTFELD: Wait, wait. But what -- couldn't some people misconstrue this as a microaggression, the fact that you have to make it so small? Somebody like me, I'm deeply offended by this.PERINO: But the couch is the perfect size for you.GUILFOYLE: I think you guys were the inspiration for this, and I fully endorse it.GUTFELD: I'm very short.BOLLING: We're going to go, but before we go, who's got a bigger Instagram footprint, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?PARKER; Donald Trump is the No. 1 political candidate on Instagram.PERINO: All right. There you have it. But we don't know if that can tell you anything about election day.(END VIDEOTAPE)PERINO: All right. That was us. It was fun. There's a great picture of us on our Instagram account, if you go to that and see us all sitting around.Greg, what was up with...GUTFELD; Hey, all you guys are up on a riser, and they don't have room for me.GUILFOYLE: Greg's upset because he looks tinier.GUTFELD: They have me down there, and I'm standing, so where do I put my face while the guy's talking, and I'm like not really that into it at all.GUILFOYLE: Can you see your face looking off like some blue steel?GUTFELD: I'm just kind of like, ""OK, Instagram."" I...WILLIAMS: You were like the smart guy in chemistry class. You're just like...GUILFOYLE: Look at the difference in our legs. That's all I'm going to say.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Wow.GUILFOYLE: Meaning me and Greg.PERINO: If you go to ""The Five"" Instagram account, we have a whole bunch of pictures from our road trip Cleveland. We'll keep doing that, because we have a few more days to go here, and then we're going to be going on to Pittsburgh and then to Philly. So it will never end.GUTFELD: No.PERINO: And it's fabulous. And Instagram's going to capture it all.""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)Bolling: Time for ""One More Thing."" I'm going to go first.You know, walking around Cleveland, the places, there are a lot of law- enforcement officers walking around from all walks of life. And I thought it would be a very good thing every day this week, for my ""One More Thing,"" to take a couple of pictures and talk to these people a little bit so you get an idea of who they really are. Check that out.That's Nichelle. She has parents and a little brother. That's Jessie in the middle. He has a wife and a daughter, and Simon has a wife. Next picture please.I was walking, and I saw Cleveland cops thanking -- just saying hey, thanks, Michigan. So Cleveland was thanking Michigan, because Michigan cops and Austin, Texas, cops are here to help out. That's John, wife and four kids; Adrian, wife and two kids; Sean is there; Rick is there with a wife; Bill; Chris, a wife with two kids; and the last one, Marie on the right, she has a husband and four kids, and her husband is law enforcement.Here's my point. These are real people, too. And it's got to stop.GUILFOYLE: All right.BOLLING: Dana, you're up.GUILFOYLE: Good for you, Eric. Very nice.PERINO: I'm next? OK. So we're here at the convention, doing politics, but Senator Rob Portman, who is the Ohio senator -- he's also up for re- election, they go out and they do lots of other things during the convention. And they were out doing Habitat for Humanity today, doing a build. So they're going to help 15 current residents. They do, like, exterior home improvements, other things that people need. And this was just a way to show that there's a lot of ways to serve in public service.GUTFELD: What happened to him? What happened?PERINO: Well, he's there speaking. He's not the Pink Panther.GUTFELD: Oh, OK.PERINO: That's Senator Rob Portman. So lots of ways to serve. And Habit for Humanity is certainly a great one to highlight.BOLLING: Great. Greg, you're up.GUTFELD: Time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I hate these...GUILFOYLE: Pandas.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. Giant pandas celebrating their third birthday with cakes made of ice and bamboo.I don't like pandas. I've said this before.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: They are furry freeloaders. They sit around. All they do is eat. They offer nothing to society. They don't even mate. They're like - - they're like stuffed millennials. That's what they are.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God, who hates pandas?GUTFELD: I hate pandas!PERINO: Krauthammer loves pandas, by the way.GUTFELD: It's Mei Lun and Mei Huan. Happy birthday, you giant panda twins.BOLLING: OK, Mr. Juan, you're up.WILLIAMS: So guess who else is here at the Republican National Convention? It's my son, Raffi. And Raffi is a Republican, and so all the Republican officials and the delegates, they're all hugging and kissing him and greeting him. They don't even know me.So anyway, he may know more about the news than I do. I say that because today his new website, Circa, launched. And while the site covers more than just politics, Raffi's covering the Republican convention and politics for this new digital video news site that reaches out to Republican millennials. Raffi and the members of the Circa team are here. So go check out the site, Circa.com.BOLLING: All right. Let's get to K.G.GUILFOYLE: All right. And earlier today I attended the Books and Beers event with Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade. ""FOX & Friends"" was hosting this for Pete Hegseth, celebrating Pete's book, ""In the Arena,"" a fantastic book. And as you know, he is a FOX News contributor, regular with the ""FOX & Friends"" family, a decorated Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, and an author.So Pete's book, ""In the Arena,"" is really a vigorous call to arms to reignite American citizenship at home and restore American power abroad, using the timeless truth of Teddy Roosevelt's iconic ""man in the arena"" speech. Definitely recommend it.So when you go to buy it, pick up also a copy of Eric Bolling's book ""Wake Up, America,"" No. 5 on The New York Times best-seller list. You got a nice congratulations...BOLLING: Right here, thank you.GUILFOYLE: ... from Karl Rove last night.BOLLING: All right. That was great. We saw Karl last night, as well.All right. That's it for us. Set your DVRs so you never miss an episode of ""The Five."" That's it for us, like I just said, from day one from the RNC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"": Breaking tonight, exactly two months until America elects the next president and brand-new polls out late today show this race getting tighter in some of the most critical battleground states.Good evening and welcome to THE KELLY FILE, everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. Hours ago, one of the nation's most trusted pollsters releasing new surveys from four key states, and things are in play. Tonight Donald Trump on the campaign trail making his second visit this week to Ohio, talking education in Cleveland. The Quinnipiac University poll telling us why he's there. It is a dead heat. Clinton at 45 percent. Trump at 46 percent.Mrs. Clinton's four-point lead from early August disappearing. And in Florida, it is also tied with both candidates at 47 percent. In North Carolina, Clinton is ahead by four points, just outside the margin of error. That's the first time Quinnipiac has polled in that state. And in Pennsylvania, the most dramatic change. Clinton's lead now cut in half, down from ten points in August to five points today. Now she's ahead 48 percent to Trump's 43. So what does it tell us?Chris Stirewalt is our FOX News digital politics editor, and Mo Elleithee is the founding executive director of the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service. Great to see you both. Stirewalt, how do you see it?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, first of all, thank God that we have polls. We've lived in this wasteland of garbage internet polls, and finally we have real polling, so I'm excited.KELLY: You're a poll snob.STIREWALT: Yes. I know. I'm such a poll snob. But the truth is, this is really important because it tells us the shape of the race is changed, and it changed from where Trump was getting blown out after the conventions to now he's back in a tie in the two states, of course, that every Republican has to win, Florida and Ohio. Pennsylvania wasn't ever really going to happen. I don't think it's going to happen unless Donald Trump turns this around and becomes some sort of wave election for him, but I don't see Pennsylvania in the running.But it's North Carolina that ought to worry him because given the fact that he's got a problem in Colorado and Virginia and other states to put together the Republican map. If he can't win in North Carolina, he's got big problems. They've been spending a lot of time there. They're going to spend a lot more.KELLY: He needs North Carolina, needs it. Mo, how do you see it? Because, you know, some of her supporters got nervous when they saw that, and some of his got very happy.MO ELLEITHEE, FOUNDING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE: Well, and I'd say this as a former Hillary Clinton staffer. We should be nervous, right? I mean you don't want to be complacent at this point. And these polls kind of show why. And we've seen other state polls in the past week that do as well. What's really interesting, there were two different organizations that did 50 state polls in the past week. Washington Post-Survey Monkey did one of the most extensive ones I've seen. And they show something similar, that in a lot of these states that you just talked about, if the race is tight and within the margin of error.But what's really interesting to me is you're seeing the number of traditional battleground states shrink. Chris just talked about Virginia and Colorado, which have become perennial battleground states. She's doing fairly well in those states, outside the margin of error. The number of traditionally red states that have become battleground states is increasingly worrisome, I would think, for the Trump campaign.KELLY: Georgia.ELLEITHEE: Georgia is dead even. Arizona is within the margin of error. It shouldn't surprise anyone that Donald Trump chose to give that big immigration speech in Phoenix, and the next day. Hillary Clinton's campaign went on the air there. Something is happening. They're seeing something in the numbers in Arizona.KELLY: Uh-hm.ELLEITHEE: So, you know, if you look at the full landscape of all 50 states and the polling and the election were held today, she would win fairly comfortably in the Electoral College. So, I do think there's something to worry about there for the Trump campaign.KELLY: All right. So, what do you think is the conventional wisdom right now, Chris? Is it that it's hers to lose and he needs a huge event to turn it around? Does he have to go into those debates and just go for broke, or does he have to just sort of slow and steady, slow and steady, be a statesman, don't say anything crazy, and somehow hope, you know, the sort of missing Trump voters that his campaign has suggested are out there show up on November 8th?STIREWALT: No. He needs the contour of the race to change. While I would throw that Survey Monkey polls out on their ear and all of that other garbage, total, but in that case, deserved. I want polls in Maine. I want polls in New Hampshire. I want polls where all of these white people are living and voting. And I want to know, is Donald Trump competitive in Minnesota? Is he competitive in Maine? Is he competitive in New Hampshire? If that's the case, Mo is right. We could be looking at a changed map. But if we're not, then we're looking at a race where Donald Trump has trailed all along. He's closer now, but he still needs the structure of the race to be changed in order to win. And that's the reality for him.KELLY: Now, Mo, I get that she has this better ground game than Trump. Everybody says that on both sides of the aisle. But he is tightening this. I mean it's getting tighter, and the question is, why and whether, in the next two months, it can get so tight that the positions reverse and he's over?ELLEITHEE: Yes. Well, I wonder how much it's really tightening, or how much it's just really settling. Right. I mean, both campaigns got little bumps coming out of their conventions, and that's natural and normal, that always happens, and it usually settles. You know, we are sort of a 50/50 country or maybe more accurately a 40/40 country. Right? Whoever has got the D starts with 40 percent. Whoever has got the R starts with 40 percent.KELLY: Uh-hm.ELLEITHEE: And you're fighting that over remaining 20. But here's why that ground game matters.KELLY: Hi Gary.ELLEITHEE: Right. Yes. Well --(CROSSTALK)Well, you know, when you have races like the states we just talked about that are within the margin of error, the ground game really does matter. A really strong ground game is worth two to four points. That's the margin in some of these polls.KELLY: Uh-hm. And Trump is just now opening up offices in Florida. Why is he just now opening offices in Florida?ELLEITHEE: Big, big hoopla over the fact that he's opening 25 offices in Florida this week. The Clinton campaign has had over 50 offices in Florida for months. They've been investing in those organizers that are out there knocking on doors and making phone calls and developing one-on-one relationships with voters. That matters. If these numbers are right.KELLY: Well, if his can do twice the work of hers, you know, maybe he'll make up the difference.ELLEITHEE: Right. Right. I mean, you know, everything about him is super human.KELLY: I have to go. It's great to see you both. Has anybody here see Stirewalt got it? Have you seen the movie Parenthood? He has a scene with Steve Martin and Dianne Wiest, and she's got this, is it Wiest? It's Wiest. And she has got a couple of kids and one of them is played by Joaquin Phoenix, right? And his name is Gary. And he is walking in in her arguments and every time she sees him, she says, hi, Gary. And that is how I think about Gary Johnson. I'm going to ask him about it when he comes on the show momentarily, that and Aleppo.Well, those new polls are coming in as these candidates are hammering each other out on the campaign trail. Mrs. Clinton arguing that Trump does not have the qualifications to be president. Trump followed up on last night's commander-in-chief forum by offering a dramatic play by play takedown of her email scandal. The gloves are off. Here he is in Cleveland a few hours ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R, PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Hillary Clinton's staff deleted and digitally bleached, which is acid-cleaned, her e-mails after receiving a Congressional subpoena. That's after receiving, not before. That's after receiving. She gets a subpoena from the United States Congress, and she deletes and bleaches. She also and her staff destroyed some of her 13 different phones, but this time with a hammer. I've never done that. Then when she was interviewed by the FBI, she claimed she couldn't remember important events 39 times.She couldn't even remember whether she was trained or handling classified information. Didn't remember anything about it. So she really didn't remember, that's a problem. And if she did remember, that's a problem. She even said she didn't know what the letter C stood for, whether it was confidential, classified information, or something. All the while, as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests, the world was falling apart.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Monica Crowley, FOX News contributor, and former foreign policy assistant to President Nixon, and Roland Martin who is host of News One now on TV One and a senior analyst on the ""Tom Joyner Morning Show."" Great to see you both.Roland, let me start with you. Man's got a point, no?ROLAND MARTIN, SENIOR ANALYST, TOM JOYNER MORNING SHOW: Yes. But here's the deal. I know where she got that hammering with the Blackberry from. She got that from Tom Brady because he did that with deflate-gate. He's a Trump supporter. So, it's a great idea.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY: Don't throw a sports reference at me. I can't follow.MARTIN: No, I mean, that's what Tom Brady did.KELLY: Let's stay on Hillary and hammers and bleach. To me, you tell me. I thought the most salient point there was the fact that after she got the subpoena. After she got the subpoena, she did those things. The guy maintaining the server said he had an oh, blank moment but still went ahead and started wiping things clean.MARTIN: Look, here's the deal. If you're Donald Trump, this is what you need to attack her credibility, so it's no shock that he's doing this. But it's a little hard for me to listen to Donald Trump talk about, how Hillary forgot something when he forgot that he was actually for the Iraq war but now he's against it when he was for it. But now he's against it. So, he might want to have his memory checked as well.KELLY: Monica, that man's got a point too. Roland and Trump both making good points tonight. Your take.MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, what struck me, Megyn, about the way Donald Trump made this argument and the actual argument, two things. One, his tone. When he was attacking Mrs. Clinton today with the truth and with the facts, he did it in a tone more out of sorrow than in anger.KELLY: Mm-hmm.  CROWLEY: And I think that's actually a much more effective tack and sort of Ronald Reagan's approach of well, there you go again when the country is at stake.KELLY: Uh-hm. It's very true.CROWLEY: Yes. And the second thing too Megyn is that we know that the most problematic scandals for any politician are the ones that reinforce a preexisting negative notion about that candidate. And the reason why the server and the e-mail scandal, which continues to drip, drip, drip with every passing day -- the reason has become so damaging to her, Megyn, is because it reinforces this already existing notion that she is fundamentally untrustworthy, dishonest, out for herself, and above the law.KELLY: Uh-hm. What about that, Roland, because last night one of the things she said was, I did everything right. And she talked about how there was no header on these e-mails and, thus, how was I to know? Meanwhile, the people who work for her had been taking off the headers, in some instances at her direction. So is it like -- the American people know she did not do everything right, and it's amazing, is it not, that she still doesn't have her story straight on this issue.MARTIN: Right. Okay. I mean, I have said this multiple times. I was on your show last week. I said this on Tom Joyner. I said it on TV One. Move the hell on, okay? This is very simple. Learn to pivot. Fifty three percent of African-Americans lost their wealth during the home forecast crisis. We still have -- she was rushed last night when Matt Lauer asked her about the ISIS questioned but spent 12 minutes on e-mails. Look, simply admit I screwed up. I shouldn't have done it. The FBI, 100 people investigated it.Look, they chose not to pursue charges. I'm focused on jobs for the American people, and if they ask you ten times, give the same answer. But you're not going -- smart peoples sometimes want to prove they're really smart. They can convince you. You're not going to convince people. You're wasting time. Keep explaining. Simply say I made a mistake. I shouldn't have done it. I won't make the same mistake again.KELLY: But meanwhile, Donald Trump and the Republicans who support him are sitting back, like, you know, enjoying the popcorn because she still clearly hasn't found the message on this, and she's been struggling on the email front for weeks now. Those very weeks that Donald Trump has been closing the gap between the two of them in some of these critical polls as we saw. So you tell me whether she needs to keep working on it and come up with a better message than the one we heard last night.CROWLEY: Well, she does, Megyn, you're right. The problem is that she can't. Two-thirds of the American people took a look at the FBI report, and they believe that she should have, in fact, faced prosecution. Since Barack Obama became president in 2009, seven people have been prosecuted for far less in terms of mishandling classified material, two of whom have gone to jail.KELLY: But they did it intentionally. That's the difference. Just for the record, what the authorities found in those cases was that there was an element of intent that they found lacking, they say, in the Clinton case. Go ahead. Finish your point.CROWLEY: That's right. The FBI Director Comey indicated that the FBI could not find criminal intent. The problem, Megyn, is twofold. One, the FBI never asked her what her intent was in setting up this private, unsecured, non-government server and network. And, two, just by virtue of setting it up, that was the intent.KELLY: Mm-hmm. Didn't James Carville tell us once she didn't want Darrell Issa going through her e-mails? Now she's got Chaffetz and she's got Judicial Watch and she's got Gowdy and she's got us.CROWLEY: Right.KELLY: I got to go. Good to see you both.MARTIN: Focus on the issues.KELLY: Hillary Clinton is not the only one facing new fire tonight. General Jack Keane is here on the controversy over what Mr. Trump said about our military leaders. And Bill Bennett weighs in on how the Iraq War issue may be playing with voters. He's here. He's excited. Don't worry.Plus, after hosting last night's presidential forum, NBC host Matt Lauer being accused of everything from embarrassing his profession to outright sexism. I'll tell you what I think too.Howie Kurtz, former White House Press Secretary Bill Burton are both here on what Lauer did and whether he deserves this blowback. Man, people are mean.And then a story that's literally the stuff of nightmares. Reports of creepy clown sightings now spreading across the country and Brian Kilmeade is here with the results of our investigation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CAPTAIN MICHAEL TERRY, GREENSBORO, SC POLICE: In my 20 years, I'm not familiar with a spree of clown sightings. So this is unique, a little bizarre.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Developing tonight, new fallout surrounding comments that Donald Trump made at last night's commander-in-chief forum. He criticized American generals as having been, quote, ""Reduced to rubble under President Obama,"" suggesting that he knows more about ISIS than America's greatest military minds.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT LAUER, NBC HOST: So let me read some of the things you said. I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me. Was that the truth?TRUMP: Well, the generals under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have not been successful.LAUER: Do you know more about ISIS than they do?TRUMP: I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble. They have been reduced to a point where it's embarrassing for our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, the architect of the successful Iraq surge, the general who is chairman of The Institute for the Study of War, General Jack Keane. Great to see you, sir.GENERAL JACK KEANE (RET.), CHAIRMAN, INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF WAR: Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY: So, what do you think of that?KEANE: Well, I'm not sure what he meant by it, but let me just put some facts on the table. It's well established now by many of us that we've had a weak American president, commander-in-chief, for almost eight years now, and that makes generals look weak. We may have some politicized generals if that's what he's implying, but the reality is that every major force level decision, Megyn, that our generals have made, this president has rejected. In the early 2009, a campaign plan developed by Petraeus and General McChrystal to defeat the Taliban, they required a minimum force of 40,000.President Obama rejected that recommendation and provided 25 percent less. He also decided he would pull the force out in 12 to 15 months. Those two decisions doomed Afghanistan to the current state we find it now, a protracted stalemated war and robbed us of the opportunity for victory. In 2011, General Alston, four-star commander in Iraq, recommended to the President, a force level of over 20,000. The President rejected it and pulled out all the forces with what is now known as a disastrous consequence in Syria.In 2012, General Dempsey, General Petraeus directed the CIA, Secretary Panetta and Secretary Clinton recommended to the president robustly arm and train the Syrian moderates. He says no. In 2013, conduct a military strike, same national security team, against the Assad regime because he violated the chemical red line. He says no. In Afghanistan --KELLY: I get your point. You could go on. But your point is Trump is not wrong that, if you think about it, the generals have been reduced to rubble. In other words, they've been reduced to almost useless because whatever they tell this commander-in-chief, he disregards.KEANE: Yes, and then in 2014, what happened is as opposed to asking him what are we going to do about ISIS? He says, I want to destroy ISIS after they beheaded our Americans and invaded Iraq. He tells them what they're not going to do. No boots on the ground. The minimum 300 advisors. Of course he's changed that nine times. An air campaign with no civilian casualties and we're not going to be able to provide an air/ground team to help make that campaign more effective. We have never, ever have those kinds of restrictions placed on us in my understanding of military history in this nation. That's the truth of it. Those kinds of restrictions are unprecedented.KELLY: General Jack Keane, a man who knows of what he speaks when it comes to fighting a war, which he's done many times. Thank you for being here, sir.KEANE: Yes. Good talking to you, Megyn.KELLY: Well, the Republican nominee made more news today when visiting a charter school in Cleveland. He strayed a bit from the topic of education and instead unleashed a lengthy response to media fact-checkers who have questioned his opposition to the war in Iraq. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race. I opposed going in, and I did oppose it despite the media saying, no, yes, no. I opposed going in. Three months before the Iraq War started, I said it in an interview with Neil Cavuto that perhaps we shouldn't be doing it yet. Then on March 25th of 2003, just after the war had started, just days after, just a little while after, I was quoted as saying the war is a mess. In July of 2003, I said I would love to see New York City and some of our cities and some of the states of our nation get some of the money that's going toward Iraq.Then in August of 2004, very early in the conflict, extremely early in the conflict, right at the beginning, I made a detailed statement in an interview to ""Esquire"" magazine. This is a quote, an absolute quote -- look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. So I just wanted to set the record straight. There is so much lying going on. It's a big mistake. Totally destabilized the Middle East. It was a big mistake. Death. Death to so many people.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Bill Bennett who served as education secretary under President Ronald Reagan. Great to see you, Bill.BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Look, the truth is that's revisionist history and Trump, you know, is -- he is not mentioning the fact that in 2002, he told Howard Stern before the invasion that he was for invading Iraq, and here is that clip.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOWARD STERN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Are you for invading Iraq?TRUMP: Yes, I guess so. You know, I wish it was -- I wish the first time it was done correctly.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And then he gave many interviews thereafter. In none of those, did he say he was against the Iraq, although now he claims he had this principle stand from the beginning. And then eventually he got to the point, as did most Americans, where he started to criticize it and say that he was against it. You tell me whether I have misstated things.BENNETT: No. I think you stated them right. I think it's best to tell the truth, tell the whole truth. And he can say, look, I said I guess so, and I thought so for a while. Then after I thought about it and studied it more, I made a firm decision and changed my mind than I was supposed to.  KELLY: Right. People can understand that. He'd probably still get credit for having hesitations and then never have really thrown his full support behind it, and then coming around in the position that I don't like this.BENNETT: And here's the more important thing it seems to me, Megyn, if I may, that a lot of people are missing. He was a private citizen. He was a businessman.KELLY: Right.BENNETT: This wasn't his responsibility.KELLY: But he is the one who is trying to claim credit for having this vision. So we have to go back and look at what he said. If he didn't make an issue out of it, the media wouldn't be saying, when you were running the apprentice, you were in favor of the -- he is the one who is saying, look at my great judgment. So, if he's making us go back to look at it, we've got to look at all of it.BENNETT: But she has to take the responsibility for being a U.S. senator and, in her own mind, getting it wrong. Now the irony here is I think they were both wrong. I think we were right to go into Iraq, and I think Jack Keane, as you pointed out in recommending the surge and executing the surge, proved we were right.KELLY: Uh-hm.BENNETT: But, yes, we need to get the record absolutely straight.KELLY: But what did you make of her standing up last night in front of, you know, these men and women who had served in Iraq, who had served the country honorably, who had sacrificed their safety, their comrades had fallen, in some instances right around them, and saying it was a mistake. Like she couldn't stand by her vote. She couldn't say with the benefit of hindsight.BENNETT: That's right.KELLY: She couldn't speak all about any of the good we did or the gains we made, which her Democratic vice president said it was going to be the biggest success story of the administration until we left without any residual forces there.BENNETT: Well, I thought it was awful but all too typical too, Megyn. Look, she's got a record as a government official, a United States senator, the secretary of state. He has no such record. I understand when he says I was for this, I was for that, we should examine it, but he doesn't take responsibility for those decisions. She does, and she must. Look, it's like the $25,000 you were talking about earlier in Florida. There's a question of scale.Twenty five thousand dollars, you know, with Trump. Hundreds of millions of dollars with the Clinton Foundation while she was in government. This is what's hurting her. This is why she's falling, I think. And he is not on the ground yet. Once he gets on the ground, look how close it is with all the mistakes that have been made. I think he can get there.KELLY: Uh-hm. Bill, great to see you.BENNETT: Thank you.KELLY: We're also digging into some wild reports -- and I do say wild -- that Hillary Clinton was wearing a special ear piece during last night's event. Is it true? We'll do a fact check.Plus, Matt Lauer is taking heat from many, many people for the way he handled last night's presidential forum.Up next, we have Howie Kurtz along with former White House Press Secretary Bill Burton and a couple of thoughts perhaps from yours truly on how Matt managed the whole thing.And then libertarian candidate Gary Johnson -- hi, Gary -- he had what may be the toughest day of his campaign after a misstep on Syria, and he's here tonight on what happened after this moment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE BARNICLE, MSNBC HOST: What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo?GARY JOHNSON, FORMER NEW MEXICO GOVERNOR: And what is Aleppo?  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Sixty one days to the election, and, whoa, is there some fierce backlash to Matt Lauer and how he handled the forum that last night put the two candidates on the same stage for the very first time.Critics accusing Lauer of going easy on Trump and hammering Clinton, pointing specifically to his questions about her e-mail scandal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT LAUER, NBC'S THE TODAY SHOW HOST: You said you made not the best choice. You were communicating on highly sensitive topics. Why wasn't it more than a mistake? Why wasn't it disqualifying if you want to be commander-in-chief?HILLARY CLINTON, D, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, and...(CROSSTALK)LAUER: And you said you thought your communications in that were fairly routine.(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: It said on that report.LAUER: But Director Comey also said this after reviewing all the information. He said there is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.Some of the emails you sent and received happened while you were overseas, and Director Comey also said that while they have no proof, we assess that it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal e-mail accounts.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof tweeting that the forum, quote, ""feels like an embarrassment to journalism.""Some guy over at CNN says an unnamed NBC executive called Lauer's performance a, quote, ""disaster.""And a New York Times critic writing, quote, ""Lauer loses the war in a battle between the candidates.""Howie Kurtz, host of Fox News' Media Buzz. Bill Burton is a former Obama White House Deputy Press Secretary. So, I'll start with this. I am friends with Matt Lauer and I respect Matt Lauer a lot. I think he is actually doesn't get nearly enough credit for the tough questions he asks on that show.I don't know, Howie. You can't win in this election. You can't win, especially with, with all due respect to our brethren, the left wing press because they want to see you kill Trump. And if you try to throw too much shade at Hillary, then they want to kill you. Your thoughts.HOWARD KURTZ, THE MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST: The moderators are big, fat targets these days. And any fair reading would say this. Matt Lauer did a solid job. He threw hardballs at both candidates with one swing and a miss, which we'll get to.And a lot of criticism from the left is partisan from people who think Trump is an outrageous liar and that Matt Lauer should have smashed him to smithereens.New York Times, let me read you a new story headline. The columnists are entitled to say what they want. ""Lauer surrenders to Trump.""KELLY: Oh, God.KURTZ: This is from a guy who asked Trump, can America take the risk of electing a guy who makes so many incendiary comments that you could spark a war?KELLY: You know, the amount of opinion that goes into these reports, you know, this is what happens. Even when I had my interview with Trump in May, this is just described as somebody by sycophant, that I was a sycophant, that I am a Trump sycophant. Like this is what happens if you don't kill him, Bill.Every -- they want every interview to be a kill them, kill them. It's ridiculous. Not -- it wasn't Matt Lauer's job to kill him or her last night. Your thoughts.BILL BURTON, FORMER OBAMA DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Well, first of all, I've long thought that you were a Trump sycophant, so I'm not surprised you got called out on it.KELLY: You got fair.BURTON: You know, look, I think that Matt Lauer does do a good job doing interviews on the today show, but I think there's five or six people ahead of him at NBC who could have done a much better job more subsequent jobs than he did last night.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: What specifically were you object him to, what did you not like?BURTON: Well, look, I'm not one of the people who complain about the questions to Hillary Clinton about the emails. I think that there are questions out there. I think people do wonder certain specifics. But as I watched that in real-time, I thought, well, he's being pretty tough on her. This is setting him up to be very tough on Donald Trump as well.The problem was he wasn't. For starters, he constantly interrupted Hillary Clinton. He called her to task for mentioning Donald Trump. He never did those things to Trump during the course of the debate.It was uneven. The performance lacked what the American people, I think, needed in order to like make a fair assessment of who would be the better commander-in-chief.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But the thing is, but look at all he's got. So, with Trump, though, you know, if the goal is to make news, right, with this candidate, which generally that is your goal as a news person.Look at all the news he made with Trump. He didn't -- he didn't have to beat him up in the moment. Yes, he could have fact-checked the Iraq war thing, right?But, Howie, he got him to stay all the stuff about Putin and all that stuff about the generals. And you know, these emerging positions he's been taking on Iraq. He made a lot of news.KURTZ: Right, and if it was such a flop of an interview, how is it that we're still talking a day later about the things that Trump said and that is providing more fodder for the campaign. I do think Matt Lauer fell down on the job because it was predictable that Trump would say, I oppose the Iraq war, and he should have come back.But on other things, you know, there was sustained questioning of Hillary Clinton about the email scandal. The recent Trump controversies about the Trump Foundation contributing to improperly, to the attorney general of Florida, and the Trump University.Those weren't related to national security so maybe there wasn't the same kind of sustained questioning. But the idea that he laid for Trump, I really think reflects the high partisanship whip all the moderators, including our colleague Chris Wallace are going to face in these debates because moderators are targets now too.KELLY: In a way, Wallace will have it easier, Bill, you tell me, because they'll be next to each other. So, it's like, have it. Go for it, you two. When it's just you and the guy, you know, or you and the woman, it's tougher.BURTON: Yes, I think that's right. But I do think that it was unbalanced. It's important to note even if you just look at the way that the debate opened or the forum opened, for Hillary Clinton it was the sustained questioning. For Donald Trump, it was, well, please tell me why would you do such a good job as commander-in-chief? It wasn't really...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But, you know, that can also be a tactic by the interviewer to get the candidate talking, and with Trump, it's always fascinating when he does.BURTON: Generally that is true.KELLY: And, you know, there's always a headline. Always. Great to see you both.KURTZ: My pleasure.BURTON: Me, too.KELLY: Chris Wallace is going to do a great job, mark my words.Well, a conspiracy theory involving Clinton is now bubbling up today. The ball is like -- we'll investigate the mystery of the magic earpiece.Plus.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARNICLE: What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo?GARY JOHNSON, U.S. LIBERTARIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: About?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Aleppo.JOHNSON: And what is Aleppo?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Gary Johnson is here live in studio next with what happened after that remark. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson showed the world what a rough day looks like after this moment on a morning news show. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARNICLE: What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo.JOHNSON: About?BARNICLE: Aleppo.JOHNSON: And what is Aleppo?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're kidding.JOHNSON: No.BARNICLE: Aleppo is in Syria. It's the epicenter of the refugee crisis...JOHNSON: OK. Got it. Got it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Predictably, the media pounced with major media outlets questions and sometimes mocking his awareness about a hot spot unfolding in Syria.But some of that same media that slammed Governor Johnson for not knowing more about Syria also ignored a story there this week, a chemical weapons attack that got no mention on any of the major networks.Gary Johnson is here and joins The Kelly file live in a moment, but first we go to Benjamin Hall in London with the big story from Aleppo. Benjamin.BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, it's been just over three years since President Obama said that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would be a red line. Well, today, one report says it's just part of the normal.On Tuesday, another attack in the northern city of Aleppo. Emergency volunteers were on the scenes before the dust could even settle, and as they began pulling people from the rubble, they realized this was different. Dozens were taken to an underground hospital with breathing problems, choking, and coughing.At least 70 people were treated and a 13-year-old girl and a 29-year-old man later died from complications. The casualties were filmed being washed and decontaminated to get traces of chemicals off their bodies, but the Syrian government denies using chemical weapons.In October 2014, a Russian -ed plan was agreed to remove Syria's chemical stock pile from the country, all 600 tons of it. It's a deal now widely seen as a way to prevent Obama acting on the red line.And today, Russia continues to help the Syrian regime, bombing what it claims are terrorist targets, but which sometimes turn out to be U.S.- backed rebels. And at the same time, Russia say they want to work with the U.S.There were talks of another meeting between Kerry and his Russian counterpart Lavrov for Friday, but the State Department today said there isn't a big hope for success and they may no longer go ahead.I've been to Aleppo. I've spoken to people who were in Syrian gas attacks. They say they feel let down by Obama, that he promised action and none was taken. And today, President Assad continues to gas women and children. Megyn.KELLY: Benjamin, thank you.Joining me now, Libertarian presidential candidate and former Governor of New Mexico, Gary Johnson. Governor, good to see you. In all seriousness, you understand the situation there, right?JOHNSON: Sure.KELLY: And you understand why it's of grave concern that you aren't familiar?JOHNSON: I'm very familiar with the situation. Aleppo, though, this morning was -- is this an acronym? And I shouldn't -- I should have known but didn't, and I'm the only one to blame for that.KELLY: But do you understand, I mean, we've got Donald Trump praising Putin. Putin backs Assad. Assad is gassing his own people. Those children are being burned by their own leader.JOHNSON: Yes.KELLY: And the next person who is going to be commander-in-chief here needs to understand those issues.JOHNSON: Well, and so those issues, Aleppo, the fact that we back the opposition in Syria, the opposition is the Free Syrian Army. The Free Syrian Army is also partners with Islamists, ISIS. We arm the opposition.KELLY: Yes, that's the problem.JOHNSON: We arm the opposition.KELLY: There was a time when they weren't in there and we refused to go in, and now they're all corrupted by these terrorists.JOHNSON: Well, arm the opposition. The arms end up in ISIS' hands. Let's see. We're also backing...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well, what would you do? What would you do? You've got a 13-year-old girl dead. There's videos of babies with chemical burns on their faces. What does a President Gary Johnson do to help them?JOHNSON: Let's finish out the story, though. You've got, then we back the Kurds. The Kurds are also against ISIS. But the Kurds are...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: I understand, but I'm trying to be more forward-looking with you because you're auditioning for a job. And so the question is what does President Johnson do?JOHNSON: So, understanding that in the very first place, we're in this situation because we supported regime change. And whenever we support regime change, it always results in things being worse, not better, and it started out with Iraq.So, here it is we're dealing with ISIS, and we will see ISIS to a conclusion. But it is so...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: This is Assad. This is Assad gassing his own people.JOHNSON: And so to deal with Assad, to deal with Syria...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Crossing the red line Obama said that he could never cross.JOHNSON: We have to join with Russia to deal with this. And then Russia. So we've got Russia that's also bombing the terrorists...KELLY: All right. I want to ask you this.JOHNSON: ... and we're going to end up in a conflict, an air conflict...KELLY: So, under President Johnson, we're out?JOHNSON: Well, no. We need to join with Russia to deal with this diplomatically. That's the only way we're going to bring an end to that. And to me, that was the...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Russia is backing Assad.JOHNSON: I understand that. And so, in that context, Russia and us have to join to bring an end to this. And not that Obama isn't engaged in this also, but if we don't engage in diplomacy to bring this to an end, a cease- fire at the start, it's not going to result in a resolution.KELLY: Governor Johnson, let me ask you this. Why didn't you know? I mean, I appreciate you owning the mistake. I think the viewers -- we've all made the bad mistakes. Why didn't you know?JOHNSON: Well, is it more important to know about the issue or is it more important -- and I'm not -- I'm not defending myself for not knowing. I'm not. But understanding the issues, understanding the underlying philosophy, policy that has us in this position today, I mean it's unbelievably complex. We're literally spending money on both ends of the gun shooting ourselves.KELLY: Yes. Governor, great to see you. Thanks for coming in.JOHNSON: Thank you.KELLY: It's hard to come out and admit when you make a mistake, so good for you. On national television, sometimes you have no choice. Oh, and don't forget about this. Let's hear it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PARENTHOOD QUOTE: See, you can't handle it. Todd's working now. We'll find a place to live somewhere. Hi, Gary.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Have you ever seen that movie?JOHNSON: I haven't. I guess I'm going to have to.KELLY: We'll leave it at that. Bye, Gary. Great to see you.JOHNSON: Bye, Megyn. Thank you.KELLY: It's a great movie.Up next, the crazy questions about whether Hillary was wearing a mystery earpiece last night. Plus we'll investigate the reports of creepy clown sightings when Brian Kilmeade joins us next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Hillary Clinton dealing with what some are calling a conspiracy theory today as her campaign shoots down reports suggesting she was wearing a secret, covert earpiece during a presidential town hall last night.Brian Kilmeade of Fox & Friends has been investigating this, and you found?BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX & FRIENDS SHOW CO-HOST: I found that it's not true, but it's going crazy. And it's not going away. Evidently they're claiming this to Clinton camp -- and I talked to Jennifer Griffin, who is following Hillary Clinton around because now she's talking to the press. It makes it more fun.They said it's the way the light hit the ear. And it's just amazing the two web sites are saying not only did this happen, they even found the type of thing it could be. Some technology, which is operating on my favorite wavelength, which is 300 megahertz.KELLY: Wow.KILMEADE: The problem is, if you have someone whispering in your ear things, not that we ever do that, wouldn't she get better answers? Wouldn't she have grown her hair over her ear?KELLY: She would have grown her ear. I'd see. Yes, exactly. If you're going to cheat, you've got to at least like pull it down a little, change the style a little. Put a wig on.KILMEADE: I would do that. Plus, Megyn -- excuse me, Matt Lauer was so close, they were touching knees. So, there's no way you put your ear piece in at that moment.KELLY: Well, it kept the internet a flutter for a full day. Meanwhile, there are serious problems again with clowns. You're officially our clown correspondent now.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: I don't know what to say about that.KELLY: I don't mean that the way it sounds.KILMEADE: Well, it doesn't sound...KELLY: But this is a follow up report for you.KILMEADE: Right. I don't think there's a way to spin my way out of this being a positive story but I'll take the clown title. Gags the clown first got me on your show because gags was in Green Bay, and gags the clown was walking around with balloons, scaring people, which is not illegal. It turns out gags was not a bad person. He was somebody looking to create interest in a bad movie.So, now we have something else happening and it's happening in South Carolina, where 30 kids say that this guy walking around in a clown outfit, it might be two people. It might be one. Different types of this complex is walking around in a clown outfit, saying, hey child, which is scary, do you want a laser? Do you want candy? Do you want cash? By the time people show up, the cops show up, he's not there.KELLY: Why are they doing that?KILMEADE: Why is the clown?KELLY: Why is he doing it?KILMEADE: We can't find the clown to ask him why he's doing it. Not only is it bad for a clown to do that because to lure kids is terrible in every way, shape or form. It's killing the business for good clowns who just want to work parties.If you're a good clown, now you're being lumped in. The scary thing is you are allowed to dress as a clown. That's not illegal.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: That's what the cops kept saying. There's nothing we can do about this.KILMEADE: Right.KELLY: There's nothing unlawful about.KILMEADE: But, by the way, if you can help, the cops have put out this description. We're looking for someone, a clown or a person dressed as a clown. Is there a difference? Are you born a clown as opposed to somebody dressed as a clown?KELLY: I got to leave it at that. I don't know what to think. My emotions are really confused.KILMEADE: I like a new title.KELLY: Great to see you Brian Kilmeade.KELLY: We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Happy news here at The Kelly File. Meet Poppy Malone Firth. Welcome. Welcome. The first child for our senior producer, Tommy Firth and his wife Cara. Mom and daughter doing well. So happy for all of you. We love you. Good night.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Here now in a ""Kelly File"" exclusive Governor Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor and a former presidential candidate. He returned from Israel last week where he had a chance to meet with Mr. Netanyahu.  Good to see you tonight, Governor.And so there have been real questions about why Benjamin Netanyahu is doing this. Why if it's not about politics did he not say to John Boehner, I'll do it but I'll do it after the Israeli election? Then I'll come, then I'll address the American people. If he had done that, no one would be accusing him of playing politics with this.  But he took the invitation without alerting the White House. And now some are crying foul.  MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well, I think that if he had waited until the Israeli elections, the deal might have been already done.  And part of the issue is the deadline with which this negotiation goes forth that's dangerously close. This is not a good idea for Netanyahu for his own political benefit. And anybody who thinks he's doing this in advance of the Israeli elections because it's good for him, well, they haven't been reading the Israeli press.Megyn, I was just there. I'm telling you, this is very destructive to him politically. He's doing it because he realizes that a nuclear Iran is really a death sentence to Israel. And it is a proliferation of nuclear arms across the Middle East.  And he's risking his political life because he values not just the future of Israel but really the future of civilization. The Iranians are just crazy enough to use a nuclear weapon if they had one.  KELLY: Secretary of State John Kerry says, look, give the president the benefit of the doubt in these negotiations. He is not going to and has no incentive to strike a deal with Iran that would not actually curb its nuclear abilities or be acceptable to the American people.HUCKABEE: Well, this is a president who told us we could keep our doctors, we could keep our health insurance, they're going to get to the bottom of Benghazi. And that was all about a video. We were told they're going to get to the bottom of the IRS scandal. We're going to get to the bottom of the Fast and Furious.I'm sorry, but the president has no credibility when it comes to saying, look, you can trust me. Actually, we can't. And the truth is we certainly can't trust the Iranians. And whatever legacy the president wants to have by saying, look, I made a deal with the Iranians, it can't be a good deal because you can't trust a government that is vowed openly and publicly that it's going to wipe another nation off the face of the Earth.  KELLY: It was just like, you know, within the last year they had their nine-point plan for doing exactly that.HUCKABEE: Well, Megyn, this is like saying they had 19,000 centrifuges, we're going to only let them have 6,000. This is the equivalent saying, we're not going to let a pyromaniac have a blow torch but we'll let them have, you know, a cigarette lighter and a can of gasoline. You just don't put those kind of opportunities in the hands of crazy people who would use those destructive forces.  KELLY: What do you make of the fact -- because we're going to have a Democratic representative, a Jewish Democratic representative who is going to boycott the speech tomorrow coming on right after you? What do you make of the some 50-some democrats who will not be there, who will walk out of a packed U.S. Congress tomorrow and Mr. Netanyahu shows up. And not even one member of the administration including our ambassador to Israel will attend.HUCKABEE: It's disappointing and disheartening. And I would say this, listen to the speech. If you don't agree with it, then in a free country you can certainly say that you disagree with it and you can explain why. But to not listen, to say we want diversity of views as long as they agree with ours, shouldn't we want more information not less information?  Shouldn't we want more voices speaking to this, not fewer voices? I don't understand this boycott mentality.Look, if you want to go and fold your arms and say I'm not going to stand up and I'm not even going to applaud, knock yourself out. Go for it. But I think the Prime Minister's speech is an important speech certainly for members of Congress because they need to monitor this deal. But, Megyn, this is important for all the American people and for all the people of the free world who value their liberty and who believe that there is a threat to it from the Iranians.  KELLY: It's a pivotal moment the month of March. Governor, good to see you.  HUCKABEE: Thank you, Megyn.  Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
