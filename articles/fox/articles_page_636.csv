As you listen to President Obama, consider this. His speech telling the nation he is going alone, signing an executive order, is an admission he failed. He failed every American.But he is not alone. So did every politician in the House and the Senate because illegal immigration is not a sporting event for the political amusement. It's a very serious problem with serious consequences. An executive order, that can't fix it. Only a law can.This executive order is just political drama. It doesn't solve anything. It just injects more uncertainty into an already broken system. Think about it. President Obama signs executive order with a swipe of his pen and the next president comes along two years from now and gets rid of it with a swipe of a pen.So, as you can see, an executive order doesn't deliver the certainty that we need for a very serious issue. Tonight is just politics, just a way for President Obama to poke his political opponents in the eye. And if our leaders -- I mean, all our leaders -- really want to solve illegal immigration for this nation, they could. President Obama could not be asking for airtime tonight, or Republicans busy scurrying around strategizing for the response.Instead, they would all be rolling up their sleeves and doing real work, solving the problem, not this silly stuff. And that's my ""Off the Record"" comment tonight."

This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" September 14, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, (R) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump called me to congratulate me on the debate.(APPLAUSE)PENCE: That meant the world to me. It truly did. Some people think I won.(APPLAUSE)PENCE: From where I sat, Donald Trump won the debate.(APPLAUSE)PENCE: Donald Trump's vision to make America great again won the debate.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: And Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, said it was the best vice presidential debate performance ever. That's what he said today.Some new polls out today. One in Monmouth poll, Monmouth University in Ohio shows Hillary Clinton with a slight lead although within the margin of error there in Ohio. That's down from four to two, 44, 42. And then if you look at our average, same position as we have been showing you, this is an average of recent polls that FOX considers legitimate, and that is where it stands as of tonight.Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, political columnist for ""The Washington Times,"" Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of ""National Review."" OK, Mara, the fallout from the debate, and what does it mean?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: The real question, what does it mean. Pence won the debate, I think that was pretty clear. He was smoother. He didn't take the bait. Tim Kaine came in with a clear strategy, to mention every outrageous thing Donald Trump has ever said and try to force Mike Pence to defend it, and he didn't. So Pence won the debate.Now, what does that mean for the race itself? I think probably very little. I don't see a vice presidential debate really shifting the dynamic. But he reassured a lot of Republicans, Pence did, who were feeling bad after Donald Trump's performance in the first debate, and he teed up Trump nicely I think for the next debate. And Trump is working harder and preparing for that one.BAIER: Charlie?CHARLES HURT, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, ""WASHINGTON TIMES"": And hopefully Donald Trump will learn a few lessons from his understudy in that debate.But I thought that Tim Kaine had his moments. He was able to get a lot of -- we did spend a lot of the debate listening to them talk about the accusations that have been leveled against Donald Trump. So in that respect, I think the people have gone a little bit overboard about how badly he did.But the other thing that sort of struck me was the degree to which he tried to take this -- the Hillary Clinton and the administration's foreign policy failures and tried to turn it around to being somehow Donald Trump's fault for not paying his taxes in 1995. It kind of strained credulity at times. And that does a real disservice to a guy that has a bright future ahead of him in politics and has a sort of reputation for being a non-partisan truth speaker.BAIER: So the people -- the whispers here in Washington about Mike Pence 2020 after that performance last night and that somehow he is coalescing, that's where the Republicans should be, for Donald Trump, he said this was my first hire. It shows I had good judgment.JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"": And that's a great spin for him to do because it was a good performance. It was a broad-shouldered performance one might even say. And I agree with Mara, it was -- I may even agree with Donald Trump it was the best vice presidential debate performance in history. But that's sort of like saying the best Oktoberfest in Orlando. It's saying something, but it's not saying a lot.BAIER: I know we can find an Oktoberfest in Orlando that's pretty good.GOLDBERG: That's pretty good for Orlando. Vice presidential debates don't do much. And I think that the -- one of the reasons why Pence -- one of the reasons why Pence did not forthrightly take the bait and defend Donald Trump in a lot of those accusations is that there aren't a lot of good defenses for some of that that stuff and that's not a conversation he wants to have.But also, if he is thinking about 2020, he doesn't want videotape existing four years from now where he is defending some of this stuff when the conventional wisdom or the zeitgeist has changed in an unpleasant way.BAIER: What he did was he pivoted. And that is not what Donald Trump did that first debate. Governor Scott Walker was his debate opponent in the mock debates that Governor Pence had, Governor Walker playing the role of Senator Kaine. And he was asked about some of the answers that Pence had today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By denying that Trump said things that he said, didn't he kind of create an alternate reality version of Donald Trump?GOV. SCOTT WALKER, (R) WISCONSIN: I think Mike's point in all of this was that the context was different than what Senator Kaine was saying. Certainly, for example, with Putin, we talked about this many times before, he doesn't admire Putin for being a leader. He was just pointing out how weak he thought President Obama's leadership was. So I think his point was not that he didn't say those exact things, but that Senator Kaine repeatedly was selectively taking things out of context.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: By the way, Senator Kaine just moments ago speaking to reporters saying last night got a little feisty. He said he has been getting dinged for interrupting, including even by his wife. And so there you have it. Is that not -- is this going to have any repercussions down the road?LIASSON: I think the biggest repercussions is for Mike Pence's future political ambitions. He did himself a lot of good. There were some people who thought he was running for president last night and Tim Kaine was running for vice president. But, as Jonah said, didn't take the bait, didn't try to defend Donald Trump. There were even reports that Donald Trump didn't like that. But he said he was -- they denied it and he said he was happy with it. But I think Mike Pence came out of this with his ambitions intact. And it's not a small thing to be able to run as Donald Trump's running mate without getting totally tied to every controversial thing that Donald Trump has said.HURT: I think it's interesting that -- obviously, Mike Pence did sort of deflect and change the subject on a lot of those things, and he did a pretty effective job. But he talked about how polished -- what a politician Tim Kaine is and what Hillary Clinton is. And of course the perfect political answer to a flubbed debate performance is to say, yes, people said I'm getting dinged because I interrupted too much, including from my wife. Perfect political pitch, and that's not what you're going to get from the Donald Trump campaign.BAIER: OK, speaking of Donald Trump, speaking today about Obamacare, something the former president said the other day.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Bill Clinton yesterday -- they're so angry at him. They scolded him yesterday. Clinton added, it doesn't make any sense. The insurance model just doesn't work.I think that President Obama should apologize for Obamacare.BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: You have this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people are out there busting it sometimes 60 hours a week wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Today the former president walked that back a bit, saying he is for the Affordable Care Act but it needs to be fixed. Kellyanne Conway today, Jonah, said that they should have Bill Clinton in the spin room for them.GOLDBERG: This was the most unforced, unprovoked gift error we have had in the cycle in a long time.LIASSON: That's Bill Clinton's specialty.GOLDBERG: It's amazing. Sometimes the big dog needs to be on a leash. And I think whether or not -- the Trump campaign has not effectively gone after Obamacare much in the last few months. Where I think this really could have lasting repercussions is on all of these tight Senate races. Every single Republican Senate candidate is going to be taking that sound bite and saying -- playing it over and over and over again, saying even Bill Clinton recognizes that Obamacare is crazy and a disaster. And that's going to be very useful for the RNC.BAIER: It is a political albatross, Mara.LIASSON: It's always been in a couple cycles now we have seen Obamacare be an albatross. It hasn't really risen to the top of voters concerns this year, mostly because Trump hasn't been talking about it. Health care hasn't been the number one thing. But it is an albatross. And Donald Trump has pretty much aligned himself with the House Republicans in terms of repealing it completely and then putting something in its place.BAIER: Because you have state after state that is down to basically no choices, one choice for health care and premiums and deductibles going up. That's not a great equation as you are heading into the voter booth.HURT: It's terrible. It also reveals Bill Clinton's gut political instincts are so good. And he realizes that it's a real problem. And he is the explainer in chief. But when President Obama tries to go out there and explain this stuff, people are like, what are you talking about? He gets it. Bill Clinton gets it.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" November 2, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. It's obviously not Special Report. And I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle, along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""I will tell you what, we're only six days away from the most important election so far in our lifetime. And the race is hotter than ever. Hillary Clinton is fighting for her life in the wake of the latest FBI investigation into her e-mails and other scandals rocking her campaign. Former FBI assistant director James Kallstrom explains why he believes Clinton's controversies are bigger than Watergate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS: So you say, you know, that actually this blows Watergate away in your view, what the Clintons have done, what Hillary has done. Why? Be specific on that.JAMES KALLSTROM, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: The pay for play. I mean, the foundation that gives less than 6 percent of the money to charity according to the reports that I've read. You know, the way they treated the Haitians, I think it's a classic example, where they collected all this the money and very little of it went to Haiti. And this goes on and on. I mean, it is just.(CROSSTALK)KALLSTROM: And look at WikiLeaks. I mean, look at the e-mails themselves, and the complicity of staff. And it just goes on and on.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Meanwhile, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says he thinks Hillary and her inner circle may be held criminally liable.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: There were 43 people in Watergate who were either indicted, tried, or convicted. I say that because as you watch more and more of this stuff, I don't see how John Podesta is going to stay away from the legal trouble. I don't see how Cheryl Mills is going to stay out of the legal trouble. Huma Abedin, a lot of the secondary players, the I.T. guy. I mean, this is not just about Hillary Clinton. This is a large group of people who are being carried into behavior which is illegal, much of it involves overt criminality.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. So from a messaging standpoint, Dana, a lot of you know the campaign for Hillary, the campaign for Trump, both hitting hard. One saying, look even President Obama saying this is sexism. Trump supporters saying this is serious. She could be indicted.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: One of the things that Newt Gingrich has said, you know, he doesn't think they can escape legal trouble. But some of them already have because they got immunity deals. So there's that. I mean, you are talking about some of the people like Mills and the guy that set up the e-mails. I remember in journalism school, one of the first classes I took was about covering -- from a news writing perspective, covering possible legal issues and crimes and that you are very cautious to not say that someone is actually a criminal before they are indicted and charged. And I think that's actually where we are. A friend of ours, Judge Napolitano, has a column coming out tonight that he let me see. It's going to be posted at midnight. But actually the headline caught my eye. It's called J. Edgar Comey. It's from his legal perspective and from the libertarian perspective, the one point he made that I think is one that is just to exercise caution is that we have talked about what did Comey know or see in the e-mails that led him to put the letter out that said he was opening up the investigation or continuing on and that they found more information. Because they couldn't have had a warrant, they didn't have a warrant until Sunday, if they had seen any of those e-mails, that would have been illegal.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: So it gets into the -- it doesn't mean there's not a big cloud following Hillary Clinton's campaign around. But some of the legal dissection I think would urge caution before saying she's a criminal and going to jail.GUILFOYLE: OK. Bolling, so you talked about this because there would be a constitutional crisis. What if she wins the election and an indictment does come down, whether she's in fact you know convicted, an indictment could come forward. And then, there's a whole host hearings and whatnot that would have to take place.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Imagine the president elect is under indictment, possibly end up with a felony? So while they are searching through Clinton Foundation material on one investigation, four different FBI offices doing that, another FBI office is searching through Anthony Wiener's laptop in regard to his possible -- texting a 15-year-old. And they come across things that would be concerning regarding Hillary Clinton. I think -- I could be wrong. But if you are looking over here and this is popping up and it pertains to another case, you can use that. You just probably can't bring.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: If they look at the e-mails, they didn't have a warrant to do so before Sunday.BOLLING: Right. The e-mails were on the device they were investigating Anthony Wiener for. That's what happened.(CROSSTALK)JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: They are on the device. You can't read them. If you do.BOLLING: Well, you don't know about that.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Bottom line.BOLLING: Am I wrong? If it's there, if you come across evidence.GUILFOYLE: If you come across it, you have to notify and say, I have -- we need a subpoena so that.BOLLING: Which is what they did.GUILFOYLE: But here's the problem, right. But you have to make sure and show you went to get a subpoena. You get a subpoena. And then, you would read those specific e-mails that you believe pertain to a separate.BOLLING: Isn't that exactly what he did?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: They couldn't go further until they got the warrant? It took until Sunday to get the warrant?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: My only point was that the -- did he have some sort of bombshell in the e-mails that they couldn't have looked at yet? I think that's not possible because I don't think Comey would have broken the law to do that, even though he went forward and did the letter. That's why -- that's possibly why it was so vague.BOLLING: Regardless. If some of the other things going on, Peter Kadzik, the assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice, gives a heads up to Podesta saying, hey, guess what, down the road, they are going to be looking for your e-mails. Heads up. Two days later, they are looking for e-mails. A couple of day later, the e-mails are gone, mysteriously gone. The things that are coming up.GUILFOYLE: That's corruption.BOLLING: It's insane. Bill Clinton shaking down a Saudi Sheik for $20 million, we find out about that this week. We also find Mark Rich made massive contributions to the Clinton Foundation before, during, or after he is pardoned by President Clinton, mysteriously. Mark Rich dealt oil with the Iranians during the embargo in the 70s and again in the 80s. It's amazing, some of the stuff they did.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: There's so much pay to play and so much likely corruption going on.GUILFOYLE: Global corruption. What do you say, Juan, to the people that are saying, you know, the Clintons have what appears to be you know obviously this cloud over them of a criminal syndicate, pay for play, using it to influence and the power of government office to be able to profit for their own end?WILLIAMS: You know, some of it is obvious. You have to question what went on with the foundation, Kimberly. But there's no comparison. This is what I just can't get. I mean, I was listening to Eric very carefully. And there's just no comparison about the number of legal cases and charges facing Donald Trump and they extend beyond the university case, the Trump University to the Trump pageants to the assaults on women. This is all there. This is much bigger than anything that Hillary Clinton is facing. And yet, I mean, there's a focus, so I understand it's political. You look at James Kallstrom last night, Kallstrom said he has known Donald Trump for more than 40 years, that Trump has been generous with him, I guess. Now, he is endorsing Trump. He is using his background, the fact that he is a former deputy at the FBI, to not only endorse Trump, to get involved with politics in a way I think is unseemly, but also to go after James Comey. He has been -- he says he has to talk about the FBI, but he thinks there's a revolt. The revolt may be among former FBI officials attacking James Comey. And again, I think you know people can watch this and they might come away with an impression that maybe he is trying to put his fingers on the scale more so than using his credibility as former director of the FBI.GUILFOYLE: OK. Greg.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: You are missing the big story. Anthony Wiener.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: No, he entered a sex addiction clinic rehab in Florida. The interesting thing about this place is you are allowed no phones or laptops. Those are barred from the facility. But lucky for him, he is bringing a copy of highlights, so that will be good. The big story -- the big story here is that that Hillary and company knew what Wiener did and did nothing. So that puts the government in jeopardy. What would Hillary do to keep these things quiet? What secrets would she hide? They did the opposite of an amber alert. They did -- I would call it a pervert pass, which is the reverse. They actually buried something that is potentially illegal and highly damaging. It's pretty disgusting. When you think about it, we were talking about the Clintons being a crime family, what kind of crime family are they? She really is Frank Costello from The Departed, you know, the Jack Nicholson character.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: And Peter Kadzik is like Colin Sullivan, the Matt Damon character, that works on the other side, that makes sure that everything is going to be fine. She's like -- she's like Pig Pen from Peanuts. Wherever she goes, there's a big tumble weed of dirt behind her. And everybody gets it all over their clothes and face.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: And guess what, I don't think her staff from the e-mails would disagree, talking about horrible judgment and what happened and Huma Abedin saying you know she knows, well aware of what she did and bringing these things upon herself.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: We should offer some sympathy to the FBI who was distracted from doing the kind of work they're supposed to be doing.PERINO: Yeah.GUTFELD: Whether it is gang crime or terrorism or drugs, this is an institution plagued by controversy. You can't do your best at your job if you are thinking at your job as we all know.PERINO: Remember, James Comey said that they had open cases on ISIS in all 50 states.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: Sometimes multiple cases in the states.GUILFOYLE: Those are on the back table now.GUTFELD: Yes, everything is on the back table.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: They are going to have to wait.BOLLING: They are reporting that we read that some FBI agents were literally ling up to put in their resignation because he didn't go forward with the indictments. And maybe that had something to do with here is the evidence, James Comey, director, if you don't bring this forward, I'm done or I'm walking. That could force someone's hand -- Comey's hand to come forward at this point in time, 11 days left. I can see that.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: You know what, there's no excusing. You know, Senator Grassley comes from Iowa. And Senator Grassley, of course, Iowa, a strong Trump state, and he has endorsed Trump. There's no reason for him to step out. But he stepped out this week and he said, Jim Comey, you have to provide us more information because this is not good. This is not good for the FBI, not good for the American government or trust in government for you to act against someone without specifying what it is that they are supposedly guilty of. This is like.BOLLING: You know what's a good idea?WILLIAMS: Tell me.BOLLING: President Obama.WILLIAMS: He thought it was a good idea?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: President Obama said he had the guts for him to do it. And Comey is a standup man. He backed him.WILLIAMS: And you know what President Obama said?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: The horse said today, you know what, we.BOLLING: I watched today.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: You know what the horse said.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Have you ever seen a horse walk backwards? The horse walked backwards.GUILFOYLE: And I will bet on that horse.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I find this whole thing disturbing.GUILFOYLE: No, that's Mr. Ed. All right. But he's not coming.GUTFELD: Ed Henry?GUILFOYLE: He is not coming up. Just six days away from the big vote in America, we hope you are going to tune in to the Fox News Channel next Tuesday for complete election coverage all day and night.Coming up, President Obama plays the sexism card while urging men to vote for Hillary. Is it an act of desperation by the Democrats? Details next, stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: With less than a week until the election, some new polls show the presidential rivals locked in a dead heat, which raises a question. Are Democrats getting desperate? In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Holman Jenkins writes about how Clinton has become the unsafe hand trading places with Trump, as the high risk candidate in the wake of her FBI investigation and other scandals. Meanwhile, President Obama, one of Hillary's strongest supporters, is asking male voters to consider whether it's sexism that's keeping them from voting for her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To the guys out there, I want to be honest. You know, there's a reason why we haven't had a woman president before. I want every man out there who is voting to kind of look inside yourself and ask yourself, if you are having problems with this stuff, how much of it is you know that we're just not used to it? I want you to think about it, because she is so much better qualified than the other guy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, KG. I will give you the op-ed or President Obama, your choice. This op-ed is absolutely wonderful, stunning. Which one would you like to take?GUILFOYLE: Well, I want the take on Obama. So the funny part is he says that's why we haven't had a female president before. We haven't had a female president before because last time you beat her in the primary. There was like much ado about that. It was like everybody was all in the bag for Obama and that Hillary was supposed to be the one to get it. She got her legs cut off right there. And that was it. Now, he is complaining saying everybody especially is sexist because they will choose Donald Trump over her. But they weren't sexists when they chose him over her last time around.BOLLING: Juan, can we hit this op-ed?WILLIAMS: Sure.BOLLING: You know, Holman Jenkins says Hillary Clinton has become the quote high risk candidate and goes through a couple of reasons, her past, WikiLeaks, her affinity for greater government control, healthcare. But this line, Mrs. Clinton is a screw-up, and when the trade takes trouble to announce itself, note must be taken.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Well, I think the key point here is that everybody, as we have been talking about today, says, hey, gosh, what about this FBI thing. But I got to tell you, I think the FBI thing seems to be losing steam, especially in the media these days. And the second thing is that there is risk attached, of course, to anybody. But are you kidding? Compared to Donald Trump, the risk?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: She took the reign of the high risk candidate.WILLIAMS: No, I think the high risk here is someone who doesn't have the qualifications to be president. Even Trump supporters say he is not qualified.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: If she becomes president, she could be indicted. She could be.WILLIAMS: As we discussed in the prior segment, he has got more outstanding legal cases right now and before court than she does.BOLLING: Dana, can I read another line from that?PERINO: Sure.BOLLING: Trump may not be a solution, but an outsider at least can dislodge an elite and replace it with even less habituated to using public power to favor and enrich itself, meaning I guess he is pointing to the Clinton Foundation.PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: And Bill Clinton making a lot of money off the time in office.PERINO: Definitely. And one of the things that we have seen in this race all along is that when it came down to Clinton and Trump and they had the conventions, when the news was on them, the news is on Trump, her poll numbers went up. When the news is on her, his poll numbers go up. So in the last several days before an election, Donald Trump is right where he would want to be, where the news is all focused on her and what have we seen? His poll numbers go up. Hers are going down.BOLLING: All right. Greg.GUILFOYLE: You notice a tone different, too? She's amped up, fired up, getting after it. He seems to be taking a more subdued, staying you know on message. He is on cruise control.GUTFELD: Can I go back to Obama for a minute, calling men sexist for not voting for Hillary? That's like calling me racist for not liking black licorice.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I hate black licorice.PERINO: Oh, I love it.GUTFELD: It's terrible. Gender has no relevance if the candidate or the product is actually bad. In fact, you are using it to overlook her weakness, which is actually sexism. What President Obama is saying is that if you -- he is actually the sexist, because he is saying vote for her even if she's awful because she's a woman. He is actually projecting his own sexism on to America. That's the other thing that bugs me about this. He seems to be looking down his nose at people.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: That undermines the quality of the female candidates that run across this country successfully on character and integrity and merits and experience. You should be able to choose based on that person's qualifications and suitability for office regardless.WILLIAMS: Well, let's do that. Let's do it. I'm all for it. I like Gregory's standard because what the president said was she better qualified. He said she's had a record of better public conduct. He said this shouldn't be a hard choice because the only people Trump has ever helped in his life is not children or women or families or tried to fix healthcare, but he has focused on everybody rich or a celebrity. And he said he thinks she's better qualified to be president than anybody.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: You can also go that she has compromised both national security and personal security, national security.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: And by shielding Anthony Wiener's perversion, she has compromised.WILLIAMS: Wait a minute.GUTFELD: Young people who were later contacted by him.WILLIAMS: You know I love you, but how is she.GUTFELD: She knew.WILLIAMS: She shielded.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Clinton knew that he was texting somebody in high school.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: He went even younger which means by her not doing anything, other women were contacted.WILLIAMS: You are going to blame every woman in his life?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: They had knowledge.GUTFELD: Look, the right is learning from the left. If this happened on the left -- if this was a right wing politician, left would be all over it. We're just learning.BOLLING: Let me throw one more thing at you. This is not the greatest week to say she's the most qualified.WILLIAMS: Why is that?BOLLING: Because this week we find out that Obamacare premiums are skyrocketing. Voters in swing states are getting massive premium increases. And Hillary Clinton is the one -- she wanted Clintoncare.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: She wants a bigger monstrosity.WILLIAMS: I don't think it's a monstrosity.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: The whole point she may be more experienced than Donald Trump.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: In my opinion, certainly not more qualified.GUILFOYLE: Because she's been a politician, a life-long politician and he has been a businessman. They're in two separate -- you know, as Clinton campaign would say, food groups when judging vice-presidential candidates.BOLLING: All right. Give me one these which means wrap it up and let's move on.Coming up, Bill Clinton in a feud over Obamacare on the campaign trail, we will play the tape next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Bill Clinton probably wishes everyone would forget what he said about Obamacare at a campaign stop for his wife last month.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The people who are getting killed in this deal are small business people and individuals who make just a little too much to get subsidies. They're getting whacked. So you have this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have healthcare, and then the people out there busting it sometimes 60 hours a week wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: But voters don't have a problem refreshing the former president's memory. Check out this heated confrontation between Clinton and rally-goer in the battleground state of Florida over President Obama's flailing healthcare law.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You said it was the craziest thing, so why wouldn't you repeal it.B. CLINTON: That's not at all what I said. No, oh, really, go read it.(CHEERS)B. CLINTON: Don't read it over the internet, get the whole thing. First, I campaigned hard for that law. Second, I risked losing to Congress to pass universal healthcare. Thirdly, I defended President Obama in 2010 and 2012. And he went up five points in the polls after I defended what he did with healthcare.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right. Juan, that's a fired up Bill Clinton we haven't seen on a trail for a while.WILLIAMS: Yeah. But I think it's a mistaken Bill Clinton. Because I went back and you know, you saw and I think the audience saw, he said it.PERINO: Yeah. So I pulled up what he said the next day.WILLIAMS: OK.PERINO: When he tried to fix it. And he has this thing about the healthcare acted a world of good and the 50-something efforts to repeal it, blah-blah, and he did try to fix it. But I think that.WILLIAMS: Yeah. So my feeling is.GUILFOYLE: Is that a Pinocchio?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I'm just trying to help the former president.WILLIAMS: I appreciate your generous spirit. But I'm saying, he did say that. It caused a stir and it got national attention. I mean, he is talking about a crazy system, but he did say it. You got to own up to it. I will say, he was -- this was an interesting campaign stop for him. He is in Southwest Florida. So three-quarters of the population of the area is Republican. It's about one-quarter Democrat. And they send Bill Clinton because when Clinton was running, he actually did very well. Obama won about 35 percent of the vote over there. And so here comes Bill Clinton. I think it must have stirred up the Democrats there. But, my gosh, I don't think it did well with the three-quarters of Republicans.PERINO: Eric, I wanted to ask you what their ultimate aim is. When he says it's the craziest thing in the world, it's not because he thinks there should be more competition in the market, I think the Democrats would like to see the single-payer program.BOLLING: Well, yeah. Oh, you think he said it was crazy they didn't go far enough?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: That's the left's trick on anything. It's not working, we didn't go far enough. The reality is when he did say it, he said it -- he was on a roll. It's a crazy system, we're squeezing the small businesses, the middle class.PERINO: It sounded like you.BOLLING: Exactly right though.PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: He is 100 percent right. I've been doing white boards on Obamacare for three days.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And it is. It's squeezing small business and the individual. And so he comes forward; he admits it. And then this is the problem, though. This is what's wrong with American politics. The next day he says, ""I didn't say that."" And then the next -- a week later, two weeks later, he says, ""I never said that. Go look it up."" I mean, come on, of course he said it.GUILFOYLE: But it was entertaining. Kind of Trump-esque; he got fired it up about it. But, you know, I like when he speaks the truth.BOLLING: Isn't it scary, though, when they really believe it and they're so fired up they believe they're actually saying, ""I never said that""?PERINO: I thought we were all supposed to tell it like it is.GUILFOYLE: Like the -- O.J. Simpson.PERINO: Do you miss Bill Clinton on the trail?GUTFELD: I just love it. His mouth always gets himself into trouble, no matter what he does.Obamacare is the public bathroom of government programs. Because if you look at it, you hear that there's, like, 22 million that are into it but we lost 6 million. It's maybe about 16.9 million people. Three to 7 percent of the population that are taking something that's free. It really is. It's the public bathroom of government programs. It is the last resort for people. And you always have to put newspaper down on the seat before you sit on it.GUILFOYLE: So you can read it later?PERINO: No.WILLIAMS: No, no, no.PERINO: I hope not. I hope not.Eric, did you see the news today about Aetna? So the hits just keep on coming. They said, basically, they might pull out of some of the exchanges.BOLLING: And they might pull out of a lot of the exchanges, leaving, like I said, Oklahoma and two or three states with only one choice, some parts of Arizona with one choice or no choice. It's insane. And that's what happens when government gets too involved. When they mandate something and then they don't allow for competition.I mean, even if you wanted to keep Obamacare and keep the healthcare exchanges, at least lift the rule about being able to sell it across state lines.WILLIAMS: You know, what's interesting to me is...GUILFOYLE: Anti-American.WILLIAMS: ... this plan was built on a Republican model that tried to increase competition, retain competition, not go to single payer. And so now...GUILFOYLE: What happened? Look what happened.WILLIAMS: Right. So in other words, they built a structure, Kimberly, that was intended to allow private companies to compete for services.PERINO: So it's the Republicans' fault?WILLIAMS: What I'm just saying is...GUILFOYLE: The Republicans. They created the healthcare Frankenstein.WILLIAMS: ... and of course, then the Republicans tried to block it, didn't vote for it, refused to fix it. I worry about that.PERINO: Wow, Juan.BOLLING: Don't forget one of the reasons why these healthcare companies are pulling out is because doctors are saying, ""I'm either not taking...""WILLIAMS: Medicaid?BOLLING: ""... and Obamacare"" or...WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying.BOLLING: ... they're saying, ""You know what? I'm going to take it, but I'm going to jack up the price, because if I take it, you're only going to pay me 11, 15 cents.WILLIAMS: So -- so Greg's point...GUILFOYLE: Become an accountant, because it doesn't pay to be...BOLLING: A doctor has to hire an accountant.WILLIAMS: Oh, please. Doctors have to hire accountants anyway. But I'm saying, to Greg's point, Greg, what do you think about Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid?GUTFELD: Social Security is our money. I would prefer -- yes, it's take...WILLIAMS: Money you pay in.GUTFELD: Yes, yes. And I would prefer not to. In fact, at my age, I'm over a half a century, I would like to say you can have my Social Security if you let me have the rest.WILLIAMS: Yes, you try that with the American people.GUTFELD: No, no. I think -- American people would rather have their own private health savings accounts. They would like to do it themselves.WILLIAMS: You send that to Washington. Washington will give them all their money back. And you know what? They won't have anybody to take care of them.PERINO: Up next, Greg talks about the biggest event of the year.GUTFELD: My birthday.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: It's shaping up to be one of the most crucial matchups in history, pitting human against human, belief system versus belief system, father versus son, mother versus daughter, pets versus plants. And how it turns out will affect millions around the country, perhaps even the world. There is no going back after this.The seventh game of the World Series, the Indians versus the Cubs. Or as I prefer to call it, the thing that pre-empts ""Empire.""What's great about game seven? You can have Trump supporters and Hillary fans on the same side and they won't kill each other. You can focus on something emotionally gratifying, even when it's just grown men in pajamas, running around a square made of dirt and turf and no word of politics.The most important thing about the series is how different it is from that world. The World Series is about real people, real emotion. But a large faction of election talk isn't from real people at all but bots: fake people created this propaganda. Did you know that Twitter bots, both pro-Trump and pro-Clinton, make up a lot of your Twitter traffic? So chances are, much of the stuff that upsets you has no pulse.Also absent in the game: The phony political showboating of the attention-seeking athlete. Unlike the NFL, no one takes a knee in baseball, which could be why we keep watching.So thank goodness for baseball. It may be too long, too slow, too boring, but unlike the world beyond the field, it's still too real.Anyway, Dana, game couldn't come at a better time. Right?PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: Sit down for about three and a half hours, watch some guys spitting tobacco.PERINO: So tonight I'm on ""The Kelly Files."" The Country Music Awards are on and the World Series. I mean, what's a girl to do?GUTFELD: I don't know.GUILFOYLE: Wow.GUTFELD: Well, what's a girl to do, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Well, if you have multiple television sets, you can watch all. So you can watch Dana on Megyn Kelly. You can watch the World Series and watch the CMAs. Or you can watch clips after and consolidate it.But you know what? I think because politics have been so fascinating lately; and Trump and Hillary -- it's like a UFC fighting match, like a cage match of politics. And everything is coming out, from the Rich, you know, pardon and those scandals to Vince Foster and people are resurrecting talking about that. There's all kinds of things going on.And everything that they have been involved in or alleged against any of these people for the past 20 years. So it's all on your plate right now. And, given the controversies in the NFL and with Colin Kaepernick and people being turned off by that, it's like the perfect storm that's created a problem for ratings. But the World Series is doing well.GUTFELD: Eric, you and President Obama actually share something. You are Cubs fans.BOLLING: Two Cubs fans.GUTFELD: So it's a unifier.BOLLING: Yes.GUTFELD: In some way.BOLLING: No.GUTFELD: I mean, true, he isn't born here, but you could still be his friend.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.BOLLING: What a series, though. The numbers are insane.GUILFOYLE: Yes, they're doing great.BOLLING: Crushing the numbers. Blowing out football, which is unheard of.GUILFOYLE: And nobody's seen that during the World Series.BOLLING: Why not? Two teams, one hasn't won a World Series in seven decades; the other one hasn't one in ten decades. Bill Murray outside the stadium gives an extra ticket to a guy just standing there, because he's a Cub fan. Eddie Vedder crushes the seventh inning stretch. You know who wins? America wins. You have two Midwest teams that are just both due. No one can be a loser in this World Series.GUILFOYLE: But nobody...GUTFELD: I disagree with Eddie Vedder. Every time I hear him scream, I think of a rabbit run over by a truck.BOLLING: That seventh-inning stretch was awesome. He was just -- that came from the heart.But you know, think about it. You have one guy might win three games in one World Series. That's unheard of. And also, on the other side, you've got a guy who pitches 104 mile an hour fastball...WILLIAMS: Unbelievable.BOLLING: ... who pitched last night who might have to pitch again tonight. This is great baseball.GUTFELD: What do you think, Juan? Is this -- are people paying less attention to the game because of the election?WILLIAMS: Well, no. Clearly, the ratings are so high. So I was hoping you'd ask me, as one of the girls, what I thought.GUTFELD: That's my nickname after work.WILLIAMS: I'll keep that in mind. But how can -- how can you resist watching Megyn Kelly and Dana?GUTFELD: Yes. They are the -- they are the Indians and the -- what's the other team?PERINO: The Cubs.BOLLING: I have an idea.GUTFELD: What?BOLLING: It repeats, right? ""The Kelly File"" repeats.PERINO: Yes.BOLLING: You watch the World Series.PERINO: Watch both.BOLLING: Find out what happened on the Country Music Awards.WILLIAMS: Then you wouldn't get to work the next day.BOLLING: Then you get the repeat.GUILFOYLE: Picture in picture on the screen.GUTFELD: Why is that baseball is immune -- why is baseball immune to the political influence that affected the NFL? Why do you think that? Why do you think that it happened in the NFL, but it won't happen in Major League Baseball? Any thoughts?BOLLING: I think it's because of the teams.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: These are two teams no one has seen...GUTFELD: But I mean in general.BOLLING: Cleveland and Chicago.WILLIAMS: Yes, I thought Greg was asking in general?PERINO: I don't know.WILLIAMS: You know, Adam Jones of the Orioles said, ""You know what?"" There are fewer black people in baseball than there are in football.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.GUTFELD: How about the reverse? You could say there are more people in baseball from other countries who are more grateful to be here. Like from Cuba or any part of South America that have come here, are then very...WILLIAMS: You know what happened? Even in -- when the Dodgers were in Chicago, some of the Dodgers refused to stay in the Trump hotel. They tried to downplay it, because they didn't want to make a big deal of it.GUTFELD: It had to do with the mini bar.WILLIAMS: Oh, is that it?GUTFELD: Yes. They don't have the large Kit-Kat. They didn't have the large...PERINO: I love the large Kit-Kat.GUTFELD: The large Kit-Kat is amazing.PERINO: Sometimes worth 5 bucks.GUTFELD: It's better than the Toblerone.GUILFOYLE: No it's not. No. No one really wants the Toblerone.PERINO: I want the Toblerone.GUILFOYLE: I always leave it in my room. I don't know.GUTFELD: It's the shape, isn't it?GUILFOYLE: It gets -- eww. I find it...GUTFELD: It melts quickly.Where are we going?PERINO: Stuck in your teeth.GUTFELD: All right. I've had enough of this segment.GUILFOYLE: Let's just go.GUTFELD: I've had enough of everybody here, for that matter. All right.GUILFOYLE: The feeling is mutual.GUTFELD: Up next -- stop it, Kimberly. We'll show you some of what happened today on the trail. What kind of trail? The political trail. Stay right there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: As we reminded you at the top of the show, it's now six days until the election. The presidential rivals buckling down in battlegrounds. Trump rallying supporters in Florida today on the trail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: With your vote you can beat the system, the rigged system and deliver justice, so show up early and vote. Show up early. You know the lines are incredible. The polls are all saying we're going to win Florida. Don't believe it. Don't believe it. Get out there and vote. Pretend we're slightly behind. You've got to get out. We don't want to blow this.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: We have yet to hear from Hillary Clinton. But one of her biggest surrogates, President Obama, he hit the trail for her today in North Carolina.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know what? She's not flashy. She's not going around spending all her time giving big stem winders. And so as a consequence, sometimes she's underappreciated here at home. She is tough. And when things don't go her way, she doesn't whine and she doesn't complain. She doesn't blame others, suggest that everything is rigged.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: So it was interesting to me. You know, we're approaching the point, Kimberly, where you come to closing messages. Charles Krauthammer said last night on ""Special Report"" that bringing out Alicia Machado was a desperation move by Hillary Clinton, who had her out on stage yesterday.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: And she is -- Clinton is now focusing more heavily again on Trump's inappropriate behavior with women. What do you think?GUILFOYLE: Yes, you know, I think that she should focus on her strengths, her qualifications, her ability and bringing out people like President Obama, bringing out Biden, bringing out Michelle Obama. Those are moves of strength and positioning.I don't think at this point she has much to gain by putting somebody up, like Alicia Machado. Because I think that's a little bit of a mixed bag in terms of all the different things that have gone on the news cycle with her story. But you know, focus on her. Don't even go there. Just focus on her qualifications. She's the one that has the government experience. That's what I would advise her if I were working on her campaign.I mean, when you have President Obama campaigning for you in a state like North Carolina that you really need and having a big rally there, that shows that the president's got your back. I think that's powerful imagery. I think the words that he uses -- you know, he is very good. He is good at campaigning and winning. And unfortunately, she is not. So she does need to bootstrap to him. I would, like -- I would ride that all the way.WILLIAMS: Eric, Trump, as we were saying, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, tomorrow, Thursday, he will be in North Carolina. What do you think? Is that a good strategy?BOLLING: I will have a white board at the end. Here's the thing.President Obama, Michelle Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, they're much better than she is. They're probably better candidates; they're probably better campaigners. She's losing her cool. It's six days left, and she lost her -- she got really ticked off at someone who mentioned something about her husband. She lost it.While Donald Trump is kind of like in that zone. The polls are starting to move towards his direction. He's playing it cool, wisely. He's like -- do you remember Leon Lett? You remember what he's famous for?WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: He picked up a fumble, ran it 95 yards...WILLIAMS: Wrong direction?BOLLING: No, no. To the end zone. And he went like this to show off.WILLIAMS: And a guy knocked it.BOLLING: He dropped the football on the 1 yard line before he scores. This is what Trump has...GUILFOYLE: Showboating doesn't pay.BOLLING: Right. Don't showboat it. Play low key. And just take this thing into the end zone. And I think he has a very, very serious shot at winning.WILLIAMS: Well, let's come to that point then, Dana. Five thirty-eight, which is an election prediction system, has Clinton with a 71 percent chance of winning. The New York Times, up shot 88 percent. And Princeton University's model has it -- has her at 97 percent.PERINO: Well, so 538, though, had her at a 90 percent likelihood to win two weeks ago.WILLIAMS: Right.PERINO: So he's closing, and obviously, the chances for him are getting better.We did a -- Chris Stirewalt and I recorded a podcast that will be up in a couple of minutes, I think. So you can get the latest on that from us. One thing he notes is that 40 percent of the vote total will probably be already locked in by election day.WILLIAMS: Yes. I think that's an important point. I think a quarter already of people in Florida and some other states have already voted, Nevada. Already voted.GUILFOYLE: And you heard Trump saying, ""Hey, listen, if you're not sure about your vote and you want to change it""...WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: In some states you can change.GUILFOYLE: Some states you are allowed to change it.WILLIAMS: Talk about desperate.But so I wanted to come to you, Greg, because I picked up the paper, and it said that the KKK newspaper today endorsed Donald Trump.GUTFELD: Really?WILLIAMS: Yes, it was like, wow.GUILFOYLE: They have a paper?WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: It's hard to believe. But you know, right now -- right now, you are looking at the electoral, it's like 273 to 265. The race is tighter than skinny jeans on Chris Christie. Interesting thing about this is...GUILFOYLE: They're not for everyone.GUTFELD: Yes, the media -- it's frustrating for the media, because right now, events are dictating the news. It's not the reverse. It used to be the news was cocky. They could change -- they could change the path whenever they could. Now they can't. It's out of their control.Right now Trump is Godzilla, and Hillary is Japan. And who knows where it's going to go?Although our job here is not to lead people on. Right? We're not -- we don't want to be election teases, where you know, we take you out to dinner and at the end you go home alone. It's still -- it's still an uphill battle for Trump.I mean, right now -- now it shows that he's behind in Florida and North Carolina. It keeps switching. In terms of the last time that Hillary trailed, Wisconsin, never; Virginia, never; New Hampshire, never; Michigan never; PA, not since July; Colorado, not since September. It's kind of -- I mean, it's -- you don't want to get people to think that something is going to happen that isn't.WILLIAMS: Well, that's a good point. ""One More Thing"" up next.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: All right now. It's time now for ""One More Thing"" -- Juanito.WILLIAMS: Last night, Jimmy Kimmel showed a segment in which parents told your kids, ""We ate your Halloween candy."" Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're just joking.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. I ate it all.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All gone.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (CRYING)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you kidding?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I ate it all.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, I'm not mad. I'm not happy, but I -- I still love you.(END VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my gosh.WILLIAMS: That's so sweet.BOLLING: That is an awesome kid. Very bright kid.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. So cute, right?Eric. You have the right...BOLLING: Very quick.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... board.BOLLING: The Right Board. The path math. Now I'm honestly going to tell you, I believe this. Contrary to what Greg might believe, I do believe this.Look, Romney at 206, Obama at 332. Romney plus Florida and Ohio is a must. Forget it if it doesn't happen, Florida and Ohio. That's 253. That makes the magic number 16. You need 16 electoral points. That's all you need.So either Pennsylvania, that will get it for you. Michigan will get it for you. Wisconsin and Iowa will get it for you. Minnesota and Iowa. And you can interchange Nevada with Iowa -- Nevada with Iowa or Wisconsin with Minnesota. Either one of those.Or this one. And I think the Trump campaign is looking at this one. It's Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire. These are all within margin. And he's winning everything that Romney won in 2012.GUILFOYLE: Look at the sad -- it's so funny. Funny, funny.BOLLING: There you go. Pass.GUILFOYLE: So strong.Greg.GUTFELD: All right. Let's ban a phrase, shall we? ""The stakes could not be higher."" Every single day we say the stakes could not be higher. Yet, they keep getting higher. They keep getting higher. So let's ban the stakes. You should only fry them or broil them or barbecue them.GUILFOYLE: OK. And use A-1 sauce.GUTFELD: No.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: OK.GUILFOYLE: Dana.PERINO: OK, a little book news. So just found out that ""Let Me Tell You About Jasper"" -- and thanks to everybody here that helped -- made The New York Times best seller list today for its first week, so that's good. So that's fun for little Jasper.I just want to...GUTFELD: Like he cares.PERINO: I'm going to be -- that's when the tarantula crawled on me. Should have done that for ""One More Thing.""Colorado and Wyoming, I'm coming your way the weekend after the election. So I would love to see you in my home state. And then, please, in California, sign up, because you have to get tickets to go to these. The Reagan Library on November 15 and the Nixon Library on the 16th. And then I am coming back here to do the show.BOLLING: Wow. Congrats.GUILFOYLE: Congratulations, well done. To Jasper and to Peter, too. Yes, and Emily, too.All right. So, ""Kimberly's Food Court.""GUTFELD: Just wait.GUILFOYLE: Why, every time?PERINO: Cute.GUILFOYLE: We rehearsed it. It's not going well. Nevertheless, it doesn't matter. Because when you have taco delight, everything is a happy day.So let's get a full screen here. Can we manage that? In a nice way. In a nice way. This is the whole story. If you've been watching the World Series when the Cleveland Indians' Francisco Landor (ph) stole second base in game one. Boom. Thanks to him, everybody gets a free Doritos Loco taco at any participating Taco Bell between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern today. You have one minute to do it, East Coast time. I'll enjoy.Set your DVR.
