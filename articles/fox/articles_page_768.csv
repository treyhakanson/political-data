"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" September 21, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi. I'm Eric Bolling, in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching this special edition of The Factor election 2016.Should the GOP shut down the government over Planned Parenthood? That's the big question lighting up the campaign trail. The government is due to run out of money at the end of the month if there is no new budget deal. But after a series undercover video showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of aborted baby body parts, many Republicans are now saying they can't support any new spending bills that include federal money for the abortion provider.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We shouldn't be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise. I will tell you the fact that Republican leadership in both Houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama and saying we'll give in because Obama threatens a veto.You know, Obama is committed to his principles, his liberal principles. He will fight for them. He says I will veto any budget that doesn't fund Planned Parenthood and Republicans surrender. We need to stop surrendering and start standing for our principles.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And the stakes got even higher now that the House voted 241 to 187 to defund Planned Parenthood despite a veto promise from President Obama. But is risking a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood good politics?Joining us now from Washington, D.C., Sandy Rios a pro-life radio talk show host and from Tampa, Florida Adam Goodman a Republican strategist.So Adam let's start with you. If you are advising a Republican presidential candidate would you tell them to support a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding?ADAM GOODMAN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, I will tell you this should bother everybody right now that public outcry over the practices of Planned Parenthood has turned into a potential calamity of a government shutdown and a riff within the Republican Party that's being refereed by Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats. I mean leave it to Washington to come to that.What is really worrisome to all of us and in terms of this impact on the presidential campaign, Eric, to your question is that we are seeing another example of how an act of conscience is being punished instead of rewarded and you have to ask yourself --BOLLING: So -- but Adam would you risk a government -- and we know the Republican brand got hurt badly the last time they went through with a shutdown of the government -- everyone blamed the Republicans. Would you advise Republicans to go that far to shut the government down over the $530 million?GOODMAN: I would not. And the reason for that Eric is simply this. This whole thing would be turned into an argument not over the practices of Planned Parenthood but over the demerits of shutting down government and everything that comes with it is a Trojan Horse that the Democrats and others are marching into this presidential campaign that deceives and misleads people from the real issue at hand which is the real attack on human life that we saw in these tapes that Carly Fiorina and others have certainly commented on and very passionately.BOLLING: All right. Sandy -- would you advise -- are you in favor of shutting down the government completely over dispute of this $500 million to Planned Parenthood?SANDY RIOS, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Eric, I think that's the wrong question. I think this is part of the problem. The debate is this. Would the President be willing to not fund a bill that would fund the government if it doesn't pay for what seems like it's the largest abortion provider in the nation who, likely is taking live just-born babies and cutting them apart to sell their organs. Now, if the President can't sign a bill that funds the entire government but just doesn't fund this then he is shutting down the government. The whole issue is framed the wrong way.BOLLING: Yes. There's no doubt, you can end up pushing it towards the President if it goes that far that it passed -- like we said this week, it passed the House. It may run into a stumbling block in the Senate but if it didn't President Obama would have to veto it and then you are laying the government shutdown -- basically he would be saving the American people from a shutdown.RIOS: Well, first of all Adam and I probably very much agree on the atrocities that we have seen in these undercover videos. And by the way, I would advise every person listening to me. It doesn't matter if you are pro-choice, pro-abortion, this is really not an issue of abortion. This is issue of (inaudible).BOLLING: But Sandy -- you're handing a victory to President Obama. You are saying Republicans want to shut down government and now I have come through and at the last minute I'm going to veto their efforts to shut down the government. I need to keep government open. He won't even have to eat it on whether or not he is pro-abortion or not.RIOS: Eric, ok. The end of the world is not shutting down the government. The end of the world is watching this and doing nothing. Some things are worth fighting for. And I would argue if you want to talk political strategy, there has never been a more opportune time to stop this barbarity.BOLLING: No doubt. No doubt. I totally agree with you because what they showed on those videos that they were breaking the law. You cannot sell body parts for profit number one. Number two, technically, Adam you are not even supposed to be able to use taxpayer money the Hyde amendment for abortions. But isn't that what Planned Parenthood is doing?GOODMAN: It's absolutely what they are doing. And this is the reason, Eric, why in the presidential campaign ahead people are all but screaming for the next leader of the free world to fix what's broken, invest in what's working and stop fighting among ourselves and start fighting for this country.This is one of these issues, one of these acts of conscience that should be awarded. And I have to ask, when was the last time that's ever happened in Washington? I think we have it all backwards. And it's about time we started to show when an issue of conscience like this not politics, but purpose, that goes back to the very founding ideals of our country and the very best instincts in all of us.BOLLING: So let me throw something out here. I want to start with you Sandy on this idea. I'm sitting here trying to figure out what is this all about? This seems like it's a fight that both sides want to fight for their own reason.Let me solve the problem. Planned Parenthood splits up into two groups. There is Planned Parenthood, the main company and they provide services like cancer screenings, contraceptives, et cetera. And then there is Planned Parenthood abortions. The taxpayer money can go to the first group. It cannot touch the second group. Your thoughts on that?RIOS: Well, you are the money guy. I would say that money is fungible. Planned Parenthood has been telling us for years, ""Oh no, we don't use tax dollars for what we do,"" but I don't think that you can separate those two things, Eric because you find out a way to do that.BOLLING: Well, you do it. You separate into two different groups. I mean it seems very -- Adam, let me throw it to Adam. Then there is no fight. Look, you are not making a case whether or not abortion is legal or illegal. You are simply saying taxpayer money will not be going to abortion. And everyone seems to at least for the moment be ok and government doesn't shutdown.GOODMAN: I think that's a reasonable point of view. That should be something that reasonable people would engage in, discuss, debate, and hopefully pass. Unfortunately, you know, going back to the last comment this is not the way that Washington plays it. They think this is a game.If you watch these tapes, this isn't a game. This is real life and seen in a very horrific way. We have got to start doing better than this as a country. And leading our way through not just issues like this but coming together to advance the common purpose of not just life, but the American experience and this is a very bad example of that on all of us.BOLLING: All right. We'd have to --RIOS: Eric, Eric -- there are some things worth fighting for. If it's not the dismemberment of live babies I don't know what we are doing.BOLLING: No, Sandy -- that wasn't the discussion. I agree with you 100 percent.RIOS: But it is about that and that's why we have to fight.BOLLING: My point for the discussion was would it be worth it to the Republicans to shut down the government over this pool of money -- you're not changing abortion law.RIOS: Absolutely because it's right.BOLLING: You are just simply talking about the pool of money. That's all I was trying to --RIOS: No. We have to stop it out of conscience. We have to stop it whatever it takes.BOLLING: Good enough. Fair enough. All right -- Sandy and Adam, we're going to have to leave it right there. Thank you very much.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino and this is ""The Five."" That was President Obama speaking in Orlando moments ago. Alongside president -- Vice President Biden after meeting with families of victims and survivors of Sunday's terror attack. He offered many consoling words. And we also heard him get a little bit political once again, taking some veiled shots at republicans over the massacre. What -- for those of you who are just joining us, that didn't get a chance to see the president's remarks.I'll read you this, from those remarks, and we'll go to Greg for his reaction to some of the rest of the speech. He said that, ""given the last two terrorist attacks were homegrown, we are going to have to do more to prevent these"" today -- ""these events. Today, once again, too many times before I hugged grieving"" members -- ""family members, they asked, why does this keep happening? They pleaded -- we do more to stop the carnage. They don't care about politics and neither do I."" And I believe that he believes that, Greg. But what you heard, I think it was a little bit more political than you expected.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I thought it was insulting. I really did. It's pathological to deny the terror and instead focus on the instrument of terror. And it allows you to connect it to a greater context of other crime, rather than focusing like a laser on Islamism. If he needs to see it through the prism of guns and that gets him to the table to fight terror -- fine, but do not denigrate people who actually believe and know that the number one threat is Islamism. He said it's not common sense to consider defending yourself in an area like a club. Only 1 percent of the mass shootings that take place happen where you could defend yourself. The rest of them are in gun-free zones.That's common sense, Mr. President. It took three hours -- we're not standoff for that standoff to end in Orlando. It took three hours. And the reason was it took three hours to get the second gun there. So if that time gets shrunk, how do you shrink it by having people defend themselves? I'm willing to compromise, destroy ISIS and prevent terrorists from getting guns. But his unbending mind, his unwillingness to see, to see what the threat is, and to spread it thin and to focus, to focus it politically, and then -- he's basically questioning our morality. He's questioning our morality, that if we're not on his side, we're insulting these victims, and that's disgusting. It's just absolutely disgusting. And I expect more from him. And I defended him. I just -- it bugs me.PERINO: One of things, Eric, that he also said he -- said that Mateen was a single deranged person. As if he was not connected to terrorist -- terrorism. He also said, this is Charles Cooke from the ""National Review"" tweeted that, he said that, ""If you don't"" -- basically, it was along the lines of, ""if you don't think that the guns need to be banned, then you need talk to some of these family members."" And he -- and Charles Cooke writing is that, that was beneath contempt and emotional blackmail; not an argument.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: So, yes. So you say we talked about this a little bit and you knew he's going to come. We didn't see the text of the speech yet, and that was --GUTFELD: You called it.BOLLING: Yeah, we -- basically, I asked, can you just -- you represent all of us.GUTFELD: Right.BOLLING: You represent those on the right and those on the left. We know where you are politically. Can you just take an hour or half hour or 20- minute speech, and give condolences to the family members and the first responders, and leave the politics out. He didn't do much of that. He did some of the condoling -- condolences with the family members, and then he got very political. There was a lot of politics in it. Greg points out, he -- the two lines together that he said, that I'm sitting in the green room listening, my head was exploding. And he said, ""Although the motives may have been different in this act, the instruments are the same."" That's code for -- this wasn't terror, this wasn't a terror plot, this wasn't like the others, it's all about the guns. Now the problem is, Mr. President, the motives were the same. This guy, Mateen, had the same motive as the Tsarnaev brothers, as Farook in San Bernardino, as Nidal Hasan in Fort Hood -- it was all radical Jihad, it wasn't a mass murder. Yeah, sure Lanza, up in Connecticut -- it was a mass murder. And in Colorado, it was a mass murder. I get that, there are those, but there are also terrorist events. This was a terrorist event. President Obama ended with a heartfelt outreach to the gay community, and I think that was fine, except for the fact that the progressive left is the single biggest threat to the LGBT community because -- of this, and we all know, we all know that under Sharia law, there is no room to be gay. It's just -- if you're gay, you have to become not gay or die.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: Juan, this is a president who is -- as he said, he had to do a lot more of this than he would have wanted. And to there's the homegrown terror attacks, there's also Sandy Hook and others. Plus, not to mention what's going on even in Chicago, as we talked about on this show, and others have as well. He says that, tomorrow, he's glad that the Senate is going to take up this -- the gun issue. That might be fine, but what about the ISIS issue? I mean, where? Are we -- do you expect to see any changes on that front?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I would hope that the Congress would finally, you know, find the heart to say that we need to go to war with ISIS. But they refuse to vote, ever, on an authorization for use of military force, they back away from it every time. And --PERINO: Like what?WILLIAMS: I think it is --PERINO: I won't comment on that when you're finished.WILLIAMS: Sure. And I think it is common sense, Greg, that someone who has lived through Newtown, Columbine, Charleston, would say, oh, so if we give terrorists easy access to guns, people with either unstable minds or minds that have been infected by the terrorist disease, and say, oh, you can have easy access to guns, that that is on us as American people.GUTFELD: That's a conversation for another time.WILLIAMS: No, that's not.GUTFELD: That is about terror in Orlando.WILLIAMS: That is not true. This is about --GUTFELD: Attaching it to everything else.WILLIAMS: If this --GUTFELD: It dilutes our will.WILLIAMS: Oh yeah. Well, tell that to Donald Trump, because Donald Trump is saying the same thing to the NRA; that it's time to do something about .GUTFELD: No.WILLIAMS: . easy access to guns for terrorists.GUTFELD: Are we -- whose not -- I'm against easy access to guns .WILLIAMS: Good.GUTFELD: . to terrorists.WILLIAMS: Good.GUTFELD: That's not what this is about.WILLIAMS: That is what this is about.GUTFELD: It's about diversion and deflection.WILLIAMS: Well, if he was -- if this guy was, as you describe him, somehow to linked in to al-Qaeda, it -- beyond the social media --BOLLING: He wasn't on the terrorist watchlist.WILLIAMS: Then -- what?BOLLING: He wasn't on the terror watchlist.WILLIAMS: They were -- he had been investigated by the FBI .BOLLING: When he --WILLIAMS: . for terrorist connections.BOLLING: Right, right. But Juan, when he bought those guns, he wasn't on any terrorist watchlist.WILLIAMS: Correct. But if the FBI .BOLLING: So what would passing the law --WILLIAMS: . had the ability to say we --BOLLING: What would the passing the law that you recommend --KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Correct the situation.BOLLING: It wouldn't have helped Orlando.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: It would have helped because, what you would have had was the FBI had the ability, even if he wasn't on the watchlist to say, this is someone we're probing, and we do not want --BOLLING: Well, you're talking something different now.WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: Now you're saying .WILLIAMS: That is a quite simple as --BOLLING: . someone who's ever been on the watchlist .WILLIAMS: No, no, no.BOLLING: We never let him get a gun.WILLIAMS: This is someone that they were looking at. And I think what everyone .BOLLING: But --WILLIAMS: . including U.S. Senate needs to do this.BOLLING: But they cleared him from the watchlist, Juan. He went -- he walked into a gun shop, he was not on the watchlist, therefore purchased a gun or several guns.WILLIAMS: I'm saying that right now, we've heard conversations. We're talking about this yesterday, that if someone who has been investigated attempts to buy the gun that the authorities can be alerted, what you're going to see in the U.S. Senate, thank goodness for the democrats' filibuster is one, discussion about people like this getting guns, but secondly, an opportunity to expand background checks. That's good stuff.GUILFOYLE: But this still isn't dealing with the root of the problem, because we have a president who is unwilling and dangerously reckless with our national security because he's afraid of words and he will not identify the problem. Instead, he wants to divert and talk about gun control. But as we just pointed out, there isn't anything that could be on look that would have prevented him from getting these weapons, or by the way, obtaining them through illegal means. What we know is he obtained the weapons legally. What we know is this is somebody that was plotting and planning this for a very long time. He cased multiple locations, he looked for the most target-rich, soft environment and that's what he chose.GUTFELD: And by the way --GUILFOYLE: There's nothing like deranged, crazy person; evil? Yes; ISIS inspired? Yes; Islamic terrorist? Yes.GUTFELD: Then also, if he wants to talk about the other aspects of gun violence or the other incidents, the Aurora guy shot for a specific theater that was gun-free.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: There was a much closer one that didn't have that rule. So Maybe he should admit that as well.PERINO: We're going to have much more to come. I'm just going to take a moment, though, to talk about this (inaudible). I -- if I can see the point of president Obama, that, him saying the magic words of radical Islam is not going to immediately change the war on terror, then the left has to concede the point. That if the Congress were to pass a specific war authorization -- war authorization against ISIS, isn't going to change a thing. Those are magic words that the policies aren't going to change. And the left and the White House has not said that there would be something that they want to do to go after ISIS, that they are prevented from doing right now under the current (inaudible) exists at this moment.WILLIAMS: Remember that this happened because the president wanted strikes against the Syrian government, and guess what, the Congress wouldn't go along. And guess what, when it comes down to a matter of political will, Dana, as to whether or not you are saying we should put additional troops, put additional moneys into fighting ISIS at this point. And the Congress says, oh, we don't want our fingerprints on it, because war is not popular. The political will is absent.PERINO: We don't have enough time to go through all of that. I think we got to have a really good discussion on it, but we got to go.All right, just two days ago, President Obama said ISIS is weaker than it has been in years, but today, a much different tone from the CIA director, his grave warnings, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: One day after blaming republicans, not Islamic terrorists for the massacre in Orlando, The New York Times editorial board put out another outrageous piece. It's now accusing the NRA of being complicit in terrorism. And the Boston Globe's editorial board is also making a big push for more gun control of the front-page ad today. The whole paper, it shows an AR-15 rifle full size, and then the words, ""Make It Stop."" One of the paper politics in just a minute, but first, Howard Stern made a powerful case on his radio show yesterday for why Americans shouldn't be disarmed. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOWARD STERN, ""THE HOWARD STERN SHOW"" RADIO SHOW HOST: I can't believe these people come afterwards and their answer to Orlando is to take away guns from the public. The military -- and they don't mean it as derogatory statement, but they look at the public as sheep. And think about it, we are sheep. Most of us sit around all day; we don't know how to defend ourselves. We are in a flock. And we basically think everything's OK. Except the wolves, the bad guys, whether they will be ISIS, terrorists, the most gun-free zone on the planet. It happened during 9/11, it was on the plane. So what did the wolves do? They said this is great. We will just kill the sheep with box-cutters. The wolves are always plotting. They'll use box-cutters; they'll use an airplane and fly it right into a building. They don't need, they don't need AR-15s.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right. So, Howard nails it, KG .GUILFOYLE: Yeah, he does.BOLLING: He points out the wolves are killing the sheep. And who is it who is disarming the sheep?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: The left.GUILFOYLE: Unfortunately, yeah, the left, the liberals and the president wants to and the prospective liberal president, Hillary Clinton wants to. So that's not making us more safe. That's just really being in denial and spiraling in political ideology, putting the forefront, and an agenda against the Second Amendment. That's reckless, that's un-American. It's not helpful. Again, like Greg said, and you've said, you know, if they were armed, just someone was armed within that nightclub. Number one, he wouldn't have chosen it and (inaudible) wouldn't have. And number two, that wouldn't have to gone on for four hours with 49 American lives that counted on their government to keep them safe -- dead now.BOLLING: Greg, refreshing to hear someone like Howard Stern stepped up and says something like that.GUTFELD: Well, it tells you, because he's kind of a barometer. When it reaches him and he's saying this, you know that the angels are on that side. I mean, if a terror, terrorism attack succeeds in reducing the amount of guns that people have to protect themselves, then the terrorists have in a sense won, because they've taken a terrorist act, not only created fear, but reduced our ability to defend ourselves. I just want to point out, even if -- they always talk about how many guns there are in America. Over the last three decades, homicides have dropped dramatically. So as gun ownership rises, we're seeing a drop in homicides. However, there is one thing that's going up, and that's terrorist attacks. So the drop in homicides kind of tells us that law-abiding American citizens can actually handle guns. We are not morons, but we know that we have a threat here. And that if we cannot rely on law enforcement to get there in time, if it takes three hours for them to get in there, somebody, somebody's got to protect us and it has to be ourselves. We have the moral obligation. It's common sense to defend ourselves.BOLLING: Can I give you the exact numbers Greg? Twenty years, 1993 to 2013, the most recent number, 185 million firearms in '80, in '93 up to 350 million in 2013, that's an 89 percent increase in firearms. The violent crime rate and the violent crimes have going down, the rate is going from 747 per 100,000, down to 368, a 50 percent drop in violent crimes, which include murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. So you're spot on. Dana, do you want this Howard Stern's comment or you want to --PERINO: Yeah, if I could just make one comment on that and then, I could do both.BOLLING: Do it.PERINO: I like the analogy that hoard Stern used in terms of being sheep, because it made me think about something that Greg said the other day while we were watching all of this unfold which is that, people don't know how to protect themselves in this kind of a situation. So when we were growing up and we did the drills for .GUTFELD: For earthquakes.PERINO: . nuclear war, earthquakes and tornadoes --GUTFELD: Yes. Yeah.PERINO: Where eastern Colorado (inaudible) tornadoes. But in this situation, when I'm in a crowd, I don't -- I really don't, I think I would freeze, as well. We saw the Marine yesterday in Kimberly's ""One More Thing.""GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: He's trying to explain to people, now you have to move .(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . because I can't open the door.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: So he risked his life to open the door for them. So I am definitely a sheep. And I am willing to let other people defend me. Do I have a responsibility also, though, to defend myself and others? That's on my mind. But beyond that, which is the FBI and our local police forces, I think are vastly under-resourced. And if you read some --there's a piece in Politico magazine today that talks about the FBI, they don't have enough people in order to keep track of all of these. Remember that James Comey, the FBI director said that there are 50 open investigations, plural, in all 50 states of homegrown terrorists that will probably feed off of this type of copycat type of attack. It is terrorism, and I think the sheep analogy was very good. Sorry, I talked to long.BOLLING: Can I just say this to Juan?GUILFOYLE: I don't feel the sheep.BOLLING: Very quickly Juan, this is the Boston Globe, right?WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: What was the big thing that happened a couple of years ago in Boston? The Boston marathon attacks, Tsarnaev brothers dedicated to Jihad, right?WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: This is the day or a couple of days after Orlando. A guy who said, who claims to be, his allegiance with ISIS. Why is the ""Boston Globe"" putting an AR-15 on their cover?WILLIAMS: Because it's an absolute abomination that we allow --BOLLING: It wasn't you who's either attack.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: I'm just telling. It's an abomination that we, in this country allow this to go forward. And let me speak for the sheep.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Blah, blah, blah. Let me just tell what the sheep think, OK?GUILFOYLE: Blah, blah, blah.WILLIAMS: This is unbelievable, but what you have is 57 percent of the sheep. The American people say, we should have an assault weapons ban, which was allowed to lapse in 2004 by the republicans, by the republican Congress. And guess what, 90 percent of the sheep say, oh, we should have strict background checks in the country, including sheep who are gun owners.BOLLING: That's not an assault.WILLIAMS: Guess what --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: An assault weapon? Why did --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: It's not, Juan.WILLIAMS: We don't, but we don't --GUTFELD: This is about terror.WILLIAMS: No, this is about the fact . GUILFOYLE: Crazy.WILLIAMS: . that we do nothing to deal with the contagion of guns in this society. And let me tell you one more thing, you look at the death rates by guns in other developed western nations, United States is way, way --GUTFELD: Because those stats are wrong.WILLIAMS: They're not wrong.GUTFELD: Yes, they are.WILLIAMS: And let me tell you what's wrong. It's the mindset that says anybody who says this is wrong, is somehow crazy. In fact, this is a debate that's being distorted by the NRA .PERINO: Juan.WILLIAMS: . who puts money in the pockets .GUILFOYLE: What?WILLIAMS: . of our politicians.GUILFOYLE: What are you saying?WILLIAMS: So they don't listen to the sheep. Instead, they listen to the gun makers.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: An assault weapon wasn't used, you do realize that? And an AR-15 wasn't used.WILLIAMS: I'm telling you --GUILFOYLE: So you're talking about something completely different.WILLIAMS: No, no. no.BOLLING: An AR-15 .WILLIAMS: Let me just say --BOLLING: . isn't an assault weapon.WILLIAMS: Let me just something.GUILFOYLE: Yes, exactly.WILLIAMS: I didn't say anything, but you know what? There was a guy in the nightclub with a gun, did it stop him? Kimberly? No. So you know what, this kind of weapon is the kind of weapon that has no business in America.BOLLING: Can I just tell you about this weapon? This weapon is banned in some states because it doesn't have high-enough caliber bullets. If they feel it's not strong enough and it's inhumane to the animals that you use to shoot it. It's not an assault weapon. Stop it.WILLIAMS: Why would you use that to hunt animals?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It's right. It's a rifle in a costume, Juan.GUILFOYLE: It's a long --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It's a rifle in a costume.WILLIAMS: It's a military weapon.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I would say, I think that I -- I don't know how many other people in America are like me, but I might be persuadable on some of these issues. If the left could show me that there is evidence that what they're talking about could actually work, but every time I look into this issue, unlike the facts and the logic don't add up and the assault weapons ban that lasted for 10 years. The government study said, ""It didn't have an effect."" So I don't understand -- I understand the emotional want to desire, to get rid of them, but if it doesn't actually bear out in facts .WILLIAMS: But here's the --PERINO: . and logic. How can I be persuaded?WILLIAMS: How -- but I don't care.GUILFOYLE: You can't.WILLIAMS: The facts are that if you .GUILFOYLE: That will be nonsense --WILLIAMS: . live in other countries where they don't allow these plethoras of guns everywhere, the homicides rates by guns are far lower, Dana.GUTFELD: Whenever they introduce a ban on guns in countries, the homicide rate goes up.WILLIAMS: Oh, it's not true. Look at Australia and France --GUTFELD: I will look at -- I have, I have.WILLIAMS: They do not --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: And again, if the ban was in place, it wouldn't have prevented Orlando.BOLLING: All right.GUILFOYLE: Aye, aye, aye.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Fine.BOLLING: We're going to look at these things in the break.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Comments from the director of the CIA today and the status of ISIS that's sharply contradicts what the president has been telling us about the terror network, in a minute.PERINO: We need (inaudible).(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: So here's some good news: CIA Director John Brennan says ISIS is gaining strength. Sorry, I meant bad news. Anyway, I wonder if he thinks that ISIL is training and attempting to deploy operatives for further attacks?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN: We judge that ISIL is training and attempting to deploy operatives for further attacks. ISIL has a large cadre of Western fighters who could potentially serve as operatives for attacks in the West. And the group is probably exploring a variety of means for infiltrating operatives into the West, including in refugee flows, smuggling routes and legitimate methods of travel.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Wonderful. This after President Obama just played down the threat. I bet he said their ranks are shrinking:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: ISIL's ranks are shrinking, as well. Their morale is sinking. The flow of foreign fighters, including from America to Syria and Iraq, has plummeted. In fact, our intelligence community now assesses that the ranks of ISIL fighters has been reduced to the lowest levels in more than two and a half years.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So what if they're both right? The flow of fighters to Syria and Iraq has dropped, but it's because they're coming here to the West. Our response: Speed up refugee admissions in a time of war.But that's not our only problem. Our problem is we can't settle on a problem. In the old days, if there were a threat to America, we galvanized and we pulverized. Now every threat is countered with a litany of attention-seeking competing political factions. Yes, ISIS wants us dead. But really, it's gun control. It's Islamophobia. It's climate change. It's childhood obesity. It's feelings, nothing more than feelings.It's as if you're trying to do surgery and some clown keeps throwing balls at you. Imagine that after Pearl Harbor we prattled on about aviation control, swing dancing and zoot suits.So today, we no longer just fight the enemy; we fight ourselves, which causes us to fight Islamism incrementally. With ISIS, the president is acting like he's doing a jigsaw puzzle or growing tomatoes or working on his beach body. He's taking his time, isn't he? But it's our time, too.The good news is we've got the greatest military there ever is and there ever was. We just need to find the will and a leader. And we better find both soon before evil finds us.So Eric, do you think that they could both be right? That we're killing them there, but they're coming here?BOLLING: My biggest concern this morning when I'm listening to Brennan talk is that there's a complete disconnect between the CIA chief...GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: ... and the White House.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: And there's also a complete disconnect between the FBI chief and the White House. It's like intel is telling everyone, ""Don't listen to what he's saying, because it's pretty bad out there.""GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: To say that there's a large cadre of western fighters waiting and ready to come over here or are here and may be looking for ways to infiltrate and may use the refugee program, while President Obama says we should be expanding our refugee program, tells me there is a complete disconnect.I think we need to listen to the CIA, the FBI and listen to ourselves, listen to the common sense and look at what's going on around you and say maybe it's time we don't have a president who can't say ""Islamic terror,"" whatever, who discounts the Islamic threat to the American people, not calling it homegrown like he did today. And maybe now have someone who wants to be the next commander-in-chief who she agrees with him.GUTFELD: Yes, you know, the thing is, Kimberly, he said, you know, there's no longer people coming over there. As if that is good news. I always thought it was great news if the extremists would go there and leave our country.GUILFOYLE: Right, exactly. I mean, this is the problem. He doesn't get it. You know, he just doesn't understand, I think, what he's hearing in these reports from the intelligence community, or he has a complete disregard. Because when you have the director of the CIA come out and give a statement and give an analysis, an assessment like that that directly contradicts the remarks of the commander-in-chief, you know you got a problem.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: And our problem is ISIS. Unless we're going to hit them hard enough -- he can say that we've had some small gains, but really, with 49 dead Americans here? They still hold power; they still hold influence, and people are still attracted to them. You have to destroy them so they don't exist so they're no longer the cool jihad on the block, and people aren't being inspired by them. Then you will see a difference.BLITZER: You know, Dana, this should not be an election year issue. It should be an American issue.PERINO: I was just thinking about that. It's not just an American issue. It's -- we call -- President Bush called it a global war on terror for a reason. Because it was just yesterday that authorities in Europe said that they know that there are hard-core cells that are planning to move into operations as we speak in France and Belgium. Two places that we know, just this past year, have had major terrorist attacks.So I also thought the president has this -- I don't know whether it's bad luck or just a bad strategy, but it seems like every time he says something about ISIS, the next day...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ... he proves them wrong. So the next day from ""JV,"" then the next day there was the beheadings. He said they were contained, they're not. He said that their ranks are reduced. You have the CIA Director come out. And after San Bernardino he said that he had to -- he actually apologized to the American people. He said, ""I actually -- my tone was wrong."" I feel like the communications could be a lot better.GUTFELD: Yes. It's all about unifying. I really feel that way, Juan. That's our problem, is that the best strategy is to get America behind and fight terror. We just can't do it.WILLIAMS: We can't do it. I don't -- to me it's like I want a blanket, because...GUILFOYLE: We can do it.WILLIAMS: ... in this fear-filled atmosphere, I'm scared. I'm scared right now.GUTFELD: You should be, Juan. I'm ready.WILLIAMS: I know. You're getting me scared, I'm telling you.GUILFOYLE: It's called being informed and looking at the facts.WILLIAMS: But I -- but what I know is this. That when I was listening to the CIA director today, I heard him say, ""Oh, gosh, yes. We are making progress on the battlefield. We have contained them, pushed them back.""I heard him say, ""We have cut off their financial revenue streams."" I heard him say that they are on the defensive right now.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: I heard him say that they're not even telling people to come over there, because guess what? They're not functional.So to me, what he's say something is, ""Well, you now what? It's hard to deal with the social media interface. It's hard to deal with the spread of the ideology."" He talked specifically about the spread of this kind of terrorist in Africa, in Libya, right, in Nigeria.And in fact, how you have them trying new ways, including -- this is to the point -- to infiltrate the refugee flows. But it doesn't say that we can't screen refugees, Eric. That doesn't mean we have to stop being America.GUILFOYLE: Yes, you know what it means, though?BOLLING: Potentially serve as operatives for attacks in the west.WILLIAMS: Yes, but that doesn't mean that we don't know, we're incapable of screening refugees. Millions of refugees have been accepted in Germany.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Look at even to our north in Canada, thousands more.Guilfoyle: But the problem is...GUTFELD: They busted -- they busted terrorists trying to infiltrate through the migrants.GUILFOYLE: But the problem is they're using the blood of the innocent to push a political agenda is shameful, and that's what you're seeing.GUTFELD: All right. We're going to end on that one. Up ahead, Oprah Winfrey says it's time for a woman president. That's why she's backing Hillary. So why didn't she endorse her back in 2007? Why did she situate wait until after Clinton clinched the nomination? Oprah, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: In 2007, Oprah Winfrey gave her first ever endorsement to a presidential candidate. She chose Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton. Now, nearly a decade later Oprah says she's with Hillary.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You for her?OPRAH WINFREY, MEDIA MOGUL: I'm with her.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And that ""her"" is, of course, Hillary Clinton.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you think about us possibly having the first female president?WINFREY: I really believe that that is going to happen. And this is the truth. America, it's about time that we made that decision.What this says is that there is no ceiling. That ceiling just went ""poom,"" you know? It says anything is possible. Yes, when you can be leader of the free world.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: So you heard Winfrey say it's about time we had a female president. Is her gender a good enough reason to put Hillary in the White House -- Dana?PERINO: Well, I would -- I would rather -- if I were going to be the first woman president, I would rather have people say, ""It's because she was the better choice between the two options."" That would be my choice.And if you think back to what Oprah Winfrey did in 2008, she had not gotten involved in primary politics prior to that, I believe. And she chose Obama over Clinton. It was a big controversy at the time and a huge disappointment for Hillary Clinton back then.I wouldn't underestimate the power for some people of voting for the first woman president, but I also wouldn't overestimate it, either.GUILFOYLE: OK. So what do you think, Greg?GUTFELD: What a hypocrite. She -- she says it's about time. Well, eight years ago you could have endorsed her. I mean, how obvious.GUILFOYLE: She chose Obama.GUTFELD: She chose Obama. So she's telling America -- again, we're being lectured that we aren't as progressive and as thoughtful as everybody else is.By the way, a gender sell today is not enough, you know? We don't have the luxury to go by just the ""X/Y,"" whatever. We have a -- we have -- I'd like the terror card. Play the terror card; don't play the gender card. Do you have the resolve and the will and the intelligence to fight evil? That's better than the gender card.GUILFOYLE: OK. Terror card.GUTFELD: Terror card.GUILFOYLE: Not the tarot card.GUTFELD: Not tarot card.GUILFOYLE: OK, perfect.BOLLING: She meant it's about time. About this moment in time. It was too early then.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: Now it's the perfect timing.Look, you know she's going to endorse the Democrat. She waited until the Democrat came, whoever it was. If she would have done it, if it was Bernie Sanders, I guess.I'm only concerned with if Hillary Clinton is playing the gender card, claims to be the next term -- has a lot of the similar policy as President Obama. But then that one -- that one day when she said, ""Don't worry about the economy, everybody. I've got Bill over here to take care of that. Got the guy to take care of it."" Does that take any of the -- I don't know -- the luster off the -- off the...PERINO: Yes, it was silly. It was a silly thing to say.BOLLING: ... the glow for them?PERINO: I don't think she meant it that way, but that's how it came across. It was bad.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I mean -- well, you know, when she speaks, it works out -- Juan.WILLIAMS: I think there are two things to say here. One is she's a Democrat, which is what you were saying, so I don't know who you thought she was going to endorse.But I think the hypocrisy issue is the interesting one at the table. Didn't you just say that?BOLLING: I agree with you. I'm agreeing with you.WILLIAMS: That's what I just said. Does that upset you? I don't mean to upset you.GUILFOYLE: Don't make that a habit.WILLIAMS: But I must say that what strikes me is that, you know, you talk about Trump as the alternative to her. And then you look at the numbers, and it says, you know, 63 percent of women say they would never vote for Trump.And guess what? Sixty-two percent say they don't like Trump calling women pigs and slobs and bimbos. You know?Hey, so maybe Oprah Winfrey, who is so popular with American women of all stripes, decides, ""Hey, I like this woman at this time,"" given it's not even 100 years since women got the right to vote and given that we've never had a woman president.As for the hypocrisy point that I was coming to. It is -- it sounds like, oh, she picked the black guy when it was convenient, not the woman. But I think that, again, historically, there'd never been a black person, never been a woman; and she's done it this way. So if you want to call that hypocrisy.GUTFELD: She betrayed women, Juan.WILLIAMS: Is that what it is?GUTFELD: I don't know.GUILFOYLE: Leave it at that. Today's a big anniversary for Donald Trump. He jumped into the presidential race exactly one year ago, and he's certainly proven a lot of his critics wrong over the past 12 months. Will he continue through November 8? That's ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: On this day one year ago, Donald Trump rocked the political world. The billionaire businessman rode down that escalator at Trump Tower and announced he was running for president.Trump said all along he would cinch the Republican nomination. And although many on the left and the right doubted him, he proved us all wrong. He's now the presumptive GOP nominee, and he's running close in polls against Hillary Clinton.So will Trump go all the way after all?Eric, this has been your horse.BOLLING: Yes.WILLIAMS: So what do you think? A year ago...BOLLING: So a year ago today he came -- he came down the escalator with Melania and did the whole speech. And he started out for the first, I don't know, first few polls at 1 percent, and then ended up locking down the nomination. So it's been -- it's been a long year.I think he's going to win. I do. I think Hillary...WILLIAMS: He's going to be president?BOLLING: I think Hillary is such a flawed candidate that he will win.WILLIAMS: K.G.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I don't disagree. I mean, he should win. Hillary is that bad. And especially given what's going on with the economy, with the lack of jobs. Those abysmal numbers are something that would benefit someone that comes from the business sector that has experience with the economy. Coupled with the problems in national security and intelligence that we have right now with ISIS, in my opinion on the rise.And according to Brennan, you know the head of the CIA, also saying that they're getting more creative, and have multiple fronts, and access, and very good travel routes to come to this country. I don't even need to go by his word, do I? Because I saw what just happened here in this country.So I mean, did anyone think, you know, a week ago, two weeks ago that we'd be talking about 49 dead by someone who pledged allegiance to ISIS on U.S. soil? No.WILLIAMS: Let me ask you about polls, Dana. Because in fact in the recent polls what we see is Hillary Clinton doing better and better. And he's not -- and Donald Trump is not doing as well.The six-week period or so the last six weeks, people are saying, ""Boy, we thought the party was going to come together behind Trump. But we haven't seen it."" What do you think?PERINO: Well, I think that this last year has felt like a dog's year, right? It's like seven years in one. And I look at...GUTFELD: It's always about dogs.PERINO: Of course it's always about dogs. Good point.I think that a lot of concern, at the beginning is, like, yes, you can win a Republican primary. It is so hard for a Republican to win a general election, even with Hillary Clinton having to fend off Bernie Sanders up until just like a week ago.But then you see today, the president's champing at the bit to campaign for her. Everybody is getting in line. The AFL-CIO comes on board today. And it comes down to about seven states. And those seven states, we don't have great polling in those states yet. So we'll see.I do think, unfortunately, Kimberly, that we probably will be talking about another terrorist attack before November. So I don't know how much that factors into it. But there's only 20 weeks to go.WILLIAMS: There's only 20 weeks. So it's only a couple months. But Greg, in the immediate response to what happened in Orlando, I look at the polls again. It says half the U.S. disapproves of Trump's response. Midwestern states, a lot of the battlegrounds, Clinton is up. And as Dana just said that's key to Trump's hope to really win the general election.GUTFELD: It's -- you know, in an era where national security matters, this should be a walk in the park for the Republican Party. It's not.WILLIAMS: Why?GUTFELD: It's not. Because Trump has issues. He doesn't do any deep dives on the things he talks about. He deal -- he has some very -- he has some very big ideas, but he doesn't get specific.He has been able to destroy the news cycle by accelerating it so no one can keep up with the things that he's saying, and that's pretty amazing. And his selling point, his No. 1 selling point among the people I know that are voting for him is that he's not as bad as Hillary. He's not as bad as Hillary. I would like a candidate to be better than that. But apparently, that's not what that is.WILLIAMS: All right. ""One More Thing"" is up next. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" Greg, kick us off.GUTFELD: Let's do this, shall we?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Flick Picks.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: That's my Sebastian Gorka (ph) impression.Thanks to Johnny Joey Jones for letting me know about this movie. It's called ""Range 15."" It's a zombie film, if you like zombie films...PERINO: Eric.GUTFELD: ... that is produced, stars and largely funded by vets. Marcus Luttrell is in this, Randy Couture, Tim Kennedy. It's got, in this movie, you're going to have two Medal of Honor recipients. I don't know if William Shatner is one of them. You've got 20 Bronze Stars, three Silver Stars; 30 Purple Hearts are in this movie. I think it's so, if you like zombies, you love our military, go see it. It's playing. It's called ""Range 15."" It's playing in 500 theaters around the country. It opened yesterday. Zombies, military, crowd-funded.BOLLING: I love that.PERINO: Perfect. I would watch that.BOLLING: Absolutely.PERINO: All right. Eric.BOLLING: All right, check out this guy. It's an amazing young man, Jack Aiello, his eighth grade graduation from Arlington Heights, Illinois. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JACK AIELLO, EIGHTH GRADE GRADUATION SPEAKER (DOING DONALD TRUMP IMITATION): Congratulations. You are now getting to hear a speech from the magnificent Donald Trump. And let me just tell you that Thomas has been just a great school. And quite frankly, it's been fantastic.(DOING BERNIE SANDERS IMITATION): Thank you for allowing me to speak to you tonight. Let me start with the lunches. They're delicious! I do have one improvement for them, though. We need to make them free!(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: I see Fallon...PERINO: Did he do Hillary, too?BOLLING: He did Hillary. He did -- who else did he do?WILLIAMS: He's gifted.BOLLING: He did four or five. And President Obama. Fallon, Kimmel, Colbert, get this guy on.PERINO: All right. I have a sweet little one. Five-year-old Danielle Koning went to her final adoption hearing last week to officially join her new family, and guess who was there to join? Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I brought some special guests with me for your adoption today. Would you like them to come?(DISNEY PRINCESSES ENTER THE ROOM)(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: The lucky little girl from Grand Rapids, Michigan, had been living with her foster family, Sarah and Jim Koning, since 2014. And to make the day as special as possible, her foster care worker came up with the idea for everybody to dress up in Disney characters, including the judge, who was Snow White. So congratulations to Danielle and the family.WILLIAMS: Wow. That's pretty sweet.PERINO: Juan, you're next.WILLIAMS: All right. So yesterday we discussed Google searches and the search results, but what about good manners for an online search? Well, Mae Ashworth in Great Britain, she uses ""please"" and ""thank you"" when she writes Google searches. Her grandson Ben tweeted a picture of her doing it, unbelievable. And that then went viral all over the world.But you know what, it hurts -- when we talk about poor spelling, poor manners on the Internet.PERINO: Not with her.WILLIAMS: Not with Mae Ashworth.PERINO: All right. Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: That's very cute.So I've got one of those ""Oh, dear."" That's right, a little deer video. So this is some photos released by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. Apparently, this cute little baby Bambi was trapped in some fencing outside this homeowner's property. He freed it. It proceeded to run directly into the front door and into the bathroom. So he kept it in the bath tub so they -- until they could come and set it free.PERINO: That is so cute.GUILFOYLE: Just wanted a little suds here, a little controlled water.PERINO: A deer ""One More Thing.""GUTFELD: Oh, please.PERINO: All right, that's it for us.
