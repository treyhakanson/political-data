This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Personal Story Segment"" tonight, Dr. Ben Carson. Last fall he was competing well in the Republican presidential sweepstakes, but lately his poll numbers have fallen. The question tonight is can the doctor turn it around.He joins us from Charlotte, North Carolina. First of all, let's walk right through this. What do you think set you back in the court of public opinion?DR. BEN CARSON (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think there have been a lot of things. You know -- my integrity, my truthfulness -- all these things were attacked. And of course when all of those things were found to be true that I had said, nobody came back and said, oh, we found this and we found that.That coupled with the terror attacks and that very false narrative that someone who's nice and soft-spoken can't be the commander in chief, doesn't know anything about foreign policy.I have been challenging that. I've been out talking. I've been explaining to people the depth of knowledge that I have with foreign policy. And also, you know, we needed a shakeup in our campaign -- things were not getting done, things that are important. And when you're doing a campaign, you have to be proactive and you have to be energetic.O'REILLY: Ok. I think it was more the foreign policy than the spurious attacks -- spurious -- attacks on you because fair-minded people know you're a good guy. But I think the foreign policy after Paris was a big issue. And people are looking for an avenger, certainly an avenger to go take care of these ISIS thugs and, you know, other people who would hurt Americans.You don't come across as an avenger. You're too cerebral. You're too intellectual for that, where some of your competition -- Trump, Christie in particular -- do come across as avengers.CARSON: Without comparing myself to anyone, I will tell you that Abraham Lincoln was pretty cerebral.O'REILLY: Yes, he was.CARSON: Calm and nobody really thought that, you know, he was sort of a firebrand --O'REILLY: But they didn't have cable TV back then.CARSON: -- and yet look what he did.O'REILLY: Really, I mean our early politicians -- you bring up a fascinating point -- their personalities if people knew a lot of them never would have been elected. But they didn't know.CARSON: That's for sure true.O'REILLY: And now they do know everything you guys do is in a, you know, everybody sees it. So going forward --CARSON: But let me just -- can I just say --O'REILLY: Sure. Absolutely. Go ahead.CARSON: I think when people actually have an opportunity to challenge me and listen to what I have to say in terms of foreign policy and in terms of proposals for taking care of our people they will see that this is not superficial. This is not a 60-second sound bite you can use in the debate.O'REILLY: All right.Latest polling in New Hampshire not great for you; Iowa, I'm not sure -- it looks like Cruz is going to take that. Anything can happen. Do you have a strategy for the long run? Like someone Marco Rubio is a long run strategy, Jeb Bush is one, or are you dependent on the early votes?CARSON: Well, I am going to be very interested in what happens in the first four states. You know, I'm out there. You know, I've been out in Iowa for the last couple of days. Every single crowd was standing room only. Or we had to do a double duty because there's so many people waiting out in the rain.You know, there is a dynamic that is changing. And my challenge at this point is to make sure I get in front of as many people as possible so that they can actually see who I am and hear what my solutions are because there is nothing in this country that cannot be solved with common sense if we get politics and ego out of the way.O'REILLY: Ok. Big debate next week on the Fox Business Network. Again, you know, because you are a calm man and cerebral, you're up against some flame throwers on the stage. Are you going to step it up and say a little bit more than you've said previously? And with a little more emotion?CARSON: Yes. Well, you know, I'm much more energized right now because my whole campaign is much more energized. I have, you know, the right kind of support and backing right now. I think you're going to see a very energized person. You will not have a problem with that at all.O'REILLY: All right. I never had a problem with you anyway. But we are living in a time when, you know, you got a Donald Trump, you got a Chris Christie, you've got some of the other candidates that know they have to get attention. It's all about getting attention at the debate with so many people on the stage, Doctor, you know that. I'm just wondering whether you have a strategy.Are you going to bring on something to throw at them? You know, is there anything you can do?CARSON: Let me tell you what my strategy is. My strategy is Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson said that we would reach this stage in our country where people, you know, were not paying attention, were not vigilant. The government would sort of take over, start to dominate. But that before we turn into something else, the people would actually recognize what was going on. They would stop being manipulated. They would stand up and they would do the right thing. I believe that is in the process of happening right now.O'REILLY: All right.CARSON: I think right now what a lot of people are looking at the shiny object in the room and saying, oh, ga-ga, but I think when push comes to shove they're going to actually start thinking very seriously about the future for their children and grandchildren.O'REILLY: All right. Doc, always a pleasure to have you on. Thank you very much.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.'RELIGIOUS FREEDOM' LAW FOR BUSINESSES SPARKING DEBATELISA BOOTHE: The important point to make here is that the liberal left's demagoguery of this issue and demagoguery over the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is wholly inaccurate. The reality is that this law was set in place not to enshrine discrimination, but set in place to protect vulnerable religious groups like Jehovah Witnesses, or the Amish, or like Muslims. It's hypocritical that some of these individuals on the left who are criticizing the law are the same individuals who once supported it. For instance, Senator Chuck Schumer or President Obama, or even liberal groups like the ACLU.WAYNE ROGERS: There was a federal law passed, I believe signed by Clinton, which supports his position that's currently being challenged. The courts and the lawmakers have got to decide, one way or the other. This is a law that is cast in ambiguity. It's got to be cleaned up and straightened out, and made very clear what it says so that people can obey it properly.JUAN WILLIAMS: They basically said ""look, we don't want to do business with homosexuals"", right? They said they don't want to cater. That's a form of business. I thin, historically, when you look back at it people like Lester Maddox, and even Ron Paul, have said that they have a right in terms of their civil rights not to do business with people, but of course the law from Congress says ""no, you have got to abide by the laws of our country"". It's just like a contract in business. That's the basis of American business.JONATHAN HOENIG: In a free country, I think you should be allowed to discriminate against whoever you want, for whatever reason you want. So this whole idea that we need laws to protect religious freedom-religious freedom is freedom, including the freedom to be completely irrational; which is why I think this religious freedom law is completely redundant. Any laws against discrimination are immoral.REPORT: US SIGNS AGREEMENT TO TEACH IMMIGRANTS THEIR RIGHT TO UNIONIZEJUAN WILLIAMS: What this is about is global trade. And in fact, you have lots of liberals who are left in this country who object to global trade deals. The administration wants one right now that's right on the table, and they want to say ""look, we're teaching people how to unionize in their home countries"". They don't know if they're going to come here. But their point is they are in favor of raising wages and union protections for workers overseas, and to reduce the idea that any democrats or liberals would object to a trade deal.LISA BOOTHE: I can't believe that Juan was able to say that with a semi-straight face. This isn't the first time that the NLRB has engaged in any sort of egregious activity or overreach. What is concerning here is these deals have also been reached with some of the countries that provide the largest populations of immigrants, and they're also not discriminating between illegal immigrants and immigrants. Additionally, my understanding is that they are also trying to provide some sort of safeguard to illegal immigrants who potentially would be fired in the United States, which they should if they declare that they were fired under the guise of union activism.JONATHAN HOENIG: They are using the whole notion of immigration as a red herring for what really is a government problem, not an immigration problem. I mean, who is behind this? The NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, which is a branch of government specifically designed to give advantages to unions. Government shouldn't be teaching anyone anything, and certainly not teaching unions how to unionize. That is cronyism on the highest level.WAYNE ROGERS: The problem here is this is another example of the government falling all over itself. It doesn't know what it's doing. One arm of the government is saying one thing, and the other arm of the government is saying something else. First of all, if a person is illegal under the present law, and you discover that he is illegal that worker has to be fired. That's what the law says. You can't have the NLRB going around and encouraging illegals to come into the country and unionize when the law already says that you have to fire them when you hire them.THEN-SENATE MAJORITY LEADER REID: MITT ROMNEY HAS NOT PAID TAXES IN 12 YEARSWAYNE ROGERS: He's a scumbag politician. He's the worst. He stands for the worst things that we have in this country. He's a guy that will stand up on the floor of the Senate and lie deliberately, just for the purposes for political advantage.JUAN WILLIAMS: I think that it's wrong. I don't think lying is good. I will say politics is hardball, and you think about Harry Reid's attack on the Koch brothers, on other kinds of republican funders that he doesn't like. He doesn't like, clearly, Mitt Romney, money stowed overseas in the Cayman Islands, so he played it.JONATHAN HOENIG: It is power lust in the most ugly form. It's almost as if he's without conscience, without morals. Like many people in politics, the President included, will say anything, do anything to get what they want-even deceive. Would you accept this kind of deceit from a college kid talking about his final exam? You'd expel him or her. So Harry Reid can get away with it is, I think, atrocious.LISA BOOTHE: Harry Reid is a lying liar. It shouldn't surprise anyone from someone who's used the Senate floor to campaign against the Koch brothers, who's made racist jokes, and who's compared the Tea Party to anarchists. So quite frankly, I've got one thing to say to Harry Reid: see ya."	['Reid', 'Schumer']	[]

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" July 22, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Two big stories breaking tonight. Starting with Hillary Clinton announcing her running mate.  Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia.  We'll have more on that in just a minute.  But first police are giving us new details right now on a terror attack that has left people reeling as a gunman randomly opens fire on innocent  people who simply went to the mall.  Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly.  A news conference just wrapped up in Munich, Germany, where a terrorist opened fire earlier tonight, leaving behind a trail of death that started at a McDonald's and extended into a mall, bringing the city to a standstill.  Police say nine people are dead, many more injured.  For hours today, folks sheltered in place as security forces launched a massive manhunt.  At least part of the attack was caught on video, and we warn you, it is hard to watch.  (GUNFIRES)(BLEEP)How many times have we seen tapes like these in recent months?  The man in black is standing near the entrance of a McDonald's and then opens fire. Horrified passersby run for their lives.  At this hour, it's unclear if the suspect has ties to radical Islam or something else.  Police are describing him as an Iranian-German.  While one witness reported he was shouting Allahu Akbar as he fired and even targeting children.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I hear this like an alarm, boom, boom, boom, and he's still killing the children.  They make nothing.  The children were sitting to eat.  They can't run.  I hear Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.  This, I know because I'm Muslim too.  I hear this and I only cry.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  We begin with our chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge live in Washington.  Catherine?  CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Megyn, tonight ISIS social media accounts are lighting up and celebrating the attack in Munich, the same way they did a week ago when an ISIS supporter mowed down 84 people with his truck in Nice, France.  To be clear, there has been no claim of responsibility for the shooting in Munich by any terror group and German authorities say the motive is unclear. Within the last hour, confirmation at a press conference in Germany that the suspect is 18 years old, holds German and Iranian citizenship and that a man found dead near the scene killed himself and is probably the sole shooter in the attack.  Earlier police said they were searching for up to three suspects based on eyewitness accounts.  But after a review of security camera video and interviews, the German police have concluded that two others who fled the scene had nothing to do with the incident.  Meantime, the Department of Justice here in Washington is offering investigators support and assistance, and earlier today the Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told Fox he is receiving regular updates on Munich.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEH JOHNSON, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  It highlights that we all have to be vigilant in Homeland Security, in law enforcement, really worldwide and especially in this country with the national political conventions this week and next week.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE:  A terrorism analyst is also drawing our attention tonight to the reported targeting of children at that McDonald's in Munich and also in Nice, France, emphasizing that both al Qaeda and ISIS have advocated this type of attack because murdering children leaves the deepest scar in every community -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Oh, God.  Catherine, thank you.  HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.  KELLY:  Today's shooting spree is the third attack in Europe in just the last eight days.  Joining me now to discuss it, Maajid Nawaz in London.  He's a former Islamic extremist and author of, ""Radical: My Journey Out Of Islamist Extremism.""  And Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer in Washington.  He is a CIA trained former senior intelligence officer.  Great to see you both.  LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, FORMER CIA OFFICER:  Thank you.KELLY:  So, we don't know what this is yet.  I mean the latest facts that came out of the presser would seem to push us away from Islamic extremism and yet the eyewitness says, he was yelling Allahu Akbar.  Let me start with you, Lieutenant Colonel Shaffer on what you make of, you know, the conflicting facts we've just heard.  SHAFFER:  Well, look, the pattern matches that which ISIS is putting forward.  As Catherine Herridge just said, you know, the attacking of children is something of a priority for these folks right now.  So we have to look at that as a factor that we have to consider.  With that said, we do recognize that people can just go bonkers and do really bad things. But, Megyn, look, this guy got a weapon, an assault weapon in a place which you do not get assault weapons easily.  And he did clearly, I believe, he did say Allahu Akbar, and there was some issue.  We have to recognize this guy was an immigrant.  One of the issues that Germany is dealing with right now is the fact that they have had this unmitigated flurry of refugees coming in, and what has not been reported here in the United States is the GSG 9 which is their version of Delta meets the FBI, the anti-terrorism unit created after the 72 Olympic attack by the Palestinians.  GSG 9 has been raiding mosques and finding weapons caches and they've been finding evidence of explosives such as a syntax.  So this is no small issue with the Germans right now.  They're looking at this very seriously because of the issue of immigrants.  KELLY:  Maajid, what is the argument that -- you know, what about this suggests to you it's not Islamic terror?MAAJID NAWAZ, FORMER ISLAMIC EXTREMIST:  It has all the hallmarks.  I can see that.  There are three areas that make me pause just before until more information is available, Megyn.  I'm not going to say it's definitely not Jihadism.  I'm going to say that these three points here that I'm about to mention do and should make us just pause for a second and consider.  The first is that in jihadist theory, something I'm particularly acquainted with, they distinguish between suicide in the sense of somebody turning their weapon on their own body to kill it and suicide bombing in the sense of turning a body into a weapon to kill others.  And if the Munich police reports are correct, that this young man ended up killing himself, that would be something that would be highly unusual for jihadists to do.  The suicide bombing method is usually when you try and kill others by using your own body as a weapon.  So that's something that makes me think a minute and think, hold on.  Maybe there's something strange going on in this case if he did, indeed, end up killing himself. The second is his Iranian origins.  Now, most Iranian are Shia, and that happens to be the wrong sect for ISIS.  In fact, ISIS and ISIS-inspired terrorists are killing Shia across the world and especially in Iraq.  They believe them to be infidels.  So that also gives me slight pause before.  And the third is his age.  The highest killer of young men in Europe -- in Britain, sorry, is suicide.  And so I'm just wondering here, now I've got to say it's not unprecedented.  It happened in Australia at a Lindt Chocolate attacked, where a guy that did have Iranian origins converted to Sunni Jihadism.  I was in fact imprisoned in Egypt for five years with somebody who converted to Sunni Islamism from having an Iranian background.  So, that can happen too.  So, again there's another possibility.  But if this man didn't convert to Sunni Jihadism and remained Shia, it does lessen the chances that this was ISIS inspired again.  So, we're just --  KELLY:  Colonel Shaffer, the other thing though --  (CROSSTALK)NAWAZ:  Perhaps getting more information.  KELLY:  Yes.  We need more information.  The other thing they heard is that he was ranting and raving like a madman.  He was speaking against the Turks because there's a rivalry between the Germans and the Turks who are in Germany.  And you know, he seemed very disturbed.  And so, you know, some experts are saying this seems clear it's not terrorism as we understand that term, but perhaps just a madman who decided to shoot and kill a bunch of people.  NAWAZ:  I think if it's true he was shouting --  KELLY:  Sorry.  That's for Colonel Shaffer.  NAWAZ: -- or something resembling that.  KELLY:  Stand by, Maajid.  Sorry.  That's for Colonel Shaffer.  SHAFFER:  Megyn, yes.  (CROSSTALK)NAWAZ: -- is that they wouldn't necessarily say that.  They wouldn't necessarily say --KELLY:  Sorry.  We're having satellite problems.  Go ahead, Colonel.  SHAFFER:  Well, no, I think you have to consider all possibilities in this case.  And this was by definition an act of terror.  I mean, it has terrorized the public and it met with the targeting requirements of ISIS and al Qaeda.  So with that said, we have to take it very seriously.  You can still -- they are not mutually exclusive, Megyn.  You can be crazy and be a terrorist.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.SHAFFER:  The 19th hijacker was not mentally stable, and I think that's one of the reasons he was pushed out of the operation for the 9/11 attacks. With that said, this guy could have been a wanna be.  He got enough access to actually arm himself up and do something as severe as he did.  But I think we just don't know enough at this point about what his motivation was.  The fact is he basically may have been a mimic of an ISIS attack.  It may be that simple.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  We're just trying to watch the clues and our prayers to our friends in Germany tonight.  Thank you both so much.  SHAFFER:  Thank you, Megyn.  KELLY:  Less than 24 hours before this latest attack, millions of Americans were listening to Donald Trump's plan for keeping America safe.  And Bill Bennett is here next to explain why he thinks this could be a key issue in this presidential race.  Plus, President Obama and Hillary Clinton today ripped the Trump speech as dark and divisive.  Governor Mike Huckabee and Robert Zimmerman are next to debate on that.  And then it is opening night for the documentary that claims to unveil the secret past of the Democratic Party, and filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza is here to defend what could be his most controversial work yet.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Clintons are worthy successors of a tradition from Andrew Jackson through Woodrow Wilson.  Are we not done with this larcenous duo?  How much these partners in crime have already stolen from us.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Breaking tonight, not long after news broke of this new attack in Munich, Germany, Donald Trump was on Twitter offering prayers for the residents there.  And just last night, Mr. Trump used his closing speech at the Republican National Convention to talk at length about keeping Americans safe here.  He called for better intelligence gathering, tougher foreign policy, and a crackdown on immigration from any nation compromised by terror.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian -- think of this, think of this. This is not believable, but this is what's happening.  A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees.  I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.  The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponent is that our plan will put America first.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me now, Bill Bennett, a former education secretary and the host of ""The Bill Bennett Podcast.""  Bill, great to see you.  So what do you make of that?  Trump's getting considerable pushback from the left on those statements, in particular saying that we should suspend immigration from nations where there are terror concerns.  BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY:  Well, how could it make any sense to increase immigration from a country like Syria?  This is a welcome refinement Megyn of his early announcement about --  KELLY:  There's drama there.  Go ahead, Bill.  I'm sorry, you're fading in and out, but we've got you now.  Keep going.  BENNETT:  Okay.  Okay.  As I said, a welcome refinement from his earlier statement.  This just makes sense.  Look, Syria is the focal point.  This is where a lot of men, and it's mostly young men you see, not women and children.  James Clapper, the head of Defense Intelligence, has said plainly and bluntly, we do not know how to vet these people.  If you do not know how to vet these people and you know there are a lot of terrorists in Syria, why in God's name would you let them in?  I mean I think you can debate this all day long with liberals.  KELLY:  But they're saying, when he's talking about we're going to suspend immigration from countries where terrorism is an issue, you're talking about France.  You know, you're talking about Germany.  Are we going to suspend immigration from France into the United States?BENNETT:  No.  No.  He said also, unless we can develop a better vetting system.  So you have a better vetting system, which we do not have now, and then you do it.  But, look, let's think of it this way.  If a person comes in and wants to become a citizen of the United States, is it unreasonable to ask them, what do you support?  The constitution or Sharia Law?  Do you believe homosexuals should be put to death?  Do you believe women should have the same rights as men?Do you believe in honor killings, or do you believe in equal justice under law?  Now, people may fib.  They may lie on this, but this is what the vetting's about.  For now, he has said a temporary suspension of people from these countries, and he's talking about countries like Syria.  We will continue to have people coming in from France.  But if you have people from France who came into France from Syria or somewhere in the Middle East, that is ridden with terrorism, I think you've got to make the same check. This just makes sense.  KELLY:  Look, did you watch the convention, Bill?  What did you think of it?  How did the Republicans do?BENNETT:  Oh, I think they did well.  I mean I think you saw first of all three major assets, I would say, in addition to Mike Pence, who's a great guy.  Trump's family, is just, you know, spectacular, kind of hard to improve on.  He's got a lot of pizzazz.  I mean, you know, this was watchable.  A lot of people watched it, and he's got strength.  And most importantly over U.S. history, what do people want in a commander-in-chief?  A commander-in-chief, not necessarily a consoler in chief, but a commander- in-chief, and they want strength.  And I thought his speech last night was very good.  It doesn't matter so much what I think, though, Megyn.  I'm one of the few PH.D.'s who's been supporting Trump for a while.  But what matters is what the American people are thinking, and they gave him from what I can tell very good reviews.  We'll see.  I hope he stays on message.  KELLY:  I got to ask you.  We're going to do a report with Chris Stirewalt in a moment on Hillary's vice presidential pick, Tim Kaine of Virginia. What do you make of it?  How did he change the race, if it all?  BENNETT:  Not exciting, not exciting.  I won't yawn.  I'm sure other people will.  He's okay.  I guess he's solid.  This is to show the moderate side -- I think she's going to get some blowback from the left.  Can I brag about one thing for just a second?KELLY:  Sure.  Go for it.  BENNETT:  Other than Donald Trump, I think I employed more people who came on that stage and spoke than anyone else I can think of.  Paul Ryan was my employee.  Speaker of the House.  Laura Ingraham worked for me in my speech writing office, and Peter Thiel was my intern.  KELLY:  He was?BENNETT:  How about that?  Huh?KELLY:  I hope he let you in early on the whole PayPal thing.  BENNETT:  Yes.  No kidding.  I said to Peter Thiel, how about let me in on the PayPal or tipping me off about Facebook?KELLY:  Yes.BENNETT:  He was an early investor.  No such luck.  KELLY:  A lot of thanks you get.  Well, Bill, we love you, and thanks for being here.  BENNETT:  Thank you.  That matters more.  Thank you.  KELLY:  Straight ahead, we'll have a ""Kelly File"" exclusive from behind the scenes at the RNC as cameras follow Donald Trump, Jr. backstage at a critical moment.  And Mark McKinnon brings us a front-row seat to the drama.  Plus, Donald Trump's speech slammed by President Obama and by Hillary Clinton.  They say the remarks don't reflect the real America.  Governor Mike Huckabee says, not so much.  Robert Zimmerman, guess how he feels. They're coming up.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  He offered a lot of fear and anger and resentment, but no solutions about anything that he even talked about.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Serious fallout tonight after Donald Trump's historic acceptance speech last night in Cleveland, as some leading Democrats ripped what they call Mr. Trump's darkly negative message as one meant to alarm Americans into supporting his campaign.  Here's some of what they had an issue with.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation.  The attacks on our police and the terrorism of our cities threaten our very way of life.  The first test for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our communities.  When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  And here is how Hillary Clinton and President Obama reacted.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, D- PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn't really jibe with the experience of most people.  CLINTON:  I heard about Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision.  He offered a lot of fear and anger and resentment but no solutions about anything that he even talked about.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me now, Clinton supporter and DNC Committee member Robert Zimmerman.  ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, FOUNDER, ZIMMERMAN/EDELSON INC.:  Good evening.So, Robert, the President is right that doesn't really jibe with most Americans' experiences, but he set up a straw man.  He does this all the time.  Trump wasn't saying that America is falling apart and there's murder everywhere.  He was citing stats about increased murder rates and increased killings of cops.  That's real.  ZIMMERMAN:  Well, actually, according to every leading fact-checking organization, they're in fact not real.  In fact ""The Washington Post"" fact checker that you often use on me made the point that upon closer scrutiny, these doomsday statistics fall apart.  KELLY:  Which ones specifically?  Because I'm looking at them right here --  (CROSSTALK)ZIMMERMAN:  The one specifically about --  KELLY:  He said homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's 50 largest cities.  That's true.  ZIMMERMAN:  Well, excuse me. The Washington Post fact checker made the point that they have, in fact, declined by more than half since the height in 1991.  KELLY:  This is from Washington Post, that they have increased by 17 percent in --  ZIMMERMAN:  Excuse me, Megyn.  KELLY: -- America's 50 largest cities.  ZIMMERMAN:  Excuse me, Megyn.  If you read the whole article, they point out since 1991, the specifics then showed that they in fact have to decline in half.  Furthermore, when he makes reference to police officers dying in the line of duty, that's also fault.  KELLY:  No, it isn't.  The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year, he said. Washington Post.  This is true if you use -- no, let me finish. This is true if you use what the Trump campaign did.  July 2014 to July 2015 and compare it to the following year.  ZIMMERMAN:  And that's why The Washington Post fact checker says that he's taking statistics out of context.  He's manipulating them, and he does sometimes plain wrong.  KELLY:  He's going back 12 months.  ZIMMERMAN:  Excuse me.  Excuse me, Megyn.  The bigger point here is, I've seen third world dictators give more rational factual speeches than Donald Trump did last night.  He's a dangerous neophyte, and the fact that, it's not just ""The Washington Post"" fact checker but the Pulitzer Prize fact checking organization PolitiFact said he was wrong as well.  And the real issue here is, the reason every leading -- most leading generals have criticized Donald Trump as well as leading Republicans in Congress like Mike McCaul is because what he's saying is making us more -- not more safe. He's making us in a more dangerous environment.  KELLY:  How is he making us more dangerous?ZIMMERMAN:  Because according to Mike McCaul, the chairman of Homeland Security in the House, when he advocated his ban of Muslims coming into our country, General McCaul said that was a recruiting tool for terrorist.  Ray T. Odierno made the point that in fact his strategy of just dropping bombs in the Middle East was dangerous and was hurting us in the war against ISIS.  My point simply is when you look at the ticket of Hillary Clinton and Tom Kaine running, you see stability and strength versus Donald Trump, who is a dangerous neophyte and Mike Pence, who has governor, actually advocated legislation that would ban -- allow businesses not to serve gay and lesbian people.  KELLY:  All right.  (CROSSTALK)I got to go because I have another guest coming up.  Okay.  It's good to see you, Robert.  ZIMMERMAN:  It's great to be with you.  KELLY:  Joining me now, Fox News contributor, Governor Mike Huckabee.  So you heard dangerous neophyte whose policies would endanger us, in particular the Muslim ban citing Mike McCaul and others for that. Governor, your thoughts.  MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, first of all, Robert Zimmerman talks about The Washington Post fact checkers.  That's really liberal euphemism for saying that pravda was once a journalistic giant.  (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)  KELLY:  But Washington Post -- up on the ones we were talking about.  HUCKABEE:  Well, look, here's the problem. The Washington Post fact checkers will deny their own facts when someone points out to them that it validates some of the arguments that Donald Trump was making.  Here's the fact.  If you look at the overall murder rate -- and let's look at murder rate.  It has declined almost in half since 1993.  But as you point out, in big cities where liberal policies have prevailed, the murder rate is substantially up.  But one of the things that liberals never want to tell you is that while the murder rate has gone down nationally, guess what has doubled since 1993.  The number of Americans who own their own personal weaponry.  Obama goes around and talks about how Donald Trump was giving gloom and doom.  Look, Obama and Hillary, they're not worried about, you know, this kind of violence.  Not a home invasion.  They're not worried about a carjacking. Why?  Because everywhere they've traveled, and Hillary for almost 40 years, they're surrounded by people who were armed to the teekt (ph), who have rocket launchers.  KELLY:  What about Hillary's point?  President Obama's point was a straw man.  He does that a lot.  But her point, that she didn't really hear any solutions other than I'm going to be the law and order candidate, is that a fair criticism?HUCKABEE:  No, because Donald Trump did offer solutions.  He's going to show respect for the law enforcement officers so they don't wear targets on their back.  He's going to stand with them rather than invite all the people who have shot them to go to the platform of the Democratic convention.  I mean what Hillary is advocating is just nonsense.  So, I think the contrast -- I mean Republicans are very happy to present to the American people, you want to stand with the cops or you want to stand with the crooks?  That's your choice.  And, you know, I mean Hillary is going to go on to Philadelphia next week. I think she's going to have a very different answer for this. But it was interesting that while Obama was sort of sniffing at the idea that we're living in a dangerous world, it wasn't an hour later that shots were ringing out in Munich.KELLY: Yeah.HUCKABEE: Yet another city and it made him look completely out of touch with reality.KELLY: Just for the record, Hillary is not having to my knowledge anybody who actually tried to shoot a cop speak at the DNC...HUCKABEE: No, she's having family members of...KELLY: ...but he's having the mother of Michael -- the mother of Michael Brown, who Eric Holder's DOJ did find try to take the cop's gun and shoot him. Great to see you governor.HUCKABEE: Exactly.KELLY: Great to see you.HUCKABEE: Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY: So there's big news tonight as we told you. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, has announced her running mate. Virginia Senator -- former Virginia Governor, it gets confusing. He's a very well-accomplished man, Tim Kaine.Chris Stirewalt is our digital politics editor.  He's live in Philadelphia already where the Democrats are going to be holding their convention next week. And the Democrats are excite -- well, I don't know. Are they? Are they excited?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, by the way, governor -- senator/governor Kaine was also, I believe the former mayor of Richmond. He also speaks Spanish, in Espaol.KELLY: He's irritating. I don't like people who overachieve to that extent. They intimidate me.STIREWALT: I like to keep my resume nice and thin so it all fits on one page. Basically, Donald Trump gave Hillary Clinton permission to be as boring as she wants to be, which is pretty boring. If Mike Pence, as I've said before, if Mike Pence is a mayonnaise sandwich, Tim Kaine is a mayonnaise sandwich on whole wheat bread.This is her saying, oh, great, OK, so you've chosen a very, very conventional running mate who is not going to fire anybody up and is going to secure you with the base. Hillary Clinton has made an equally unexciting choice but one that reaches out in a different direction and tells you about her point of view of the election.KELLY: How? What direction? Is it that she's having trouble with white men so she chose a white man and that's going to make white man want to vote for her?STIREWALT: White men are the worst. They're just everywhere. You don't have to worry about us too much. No. The reality for Hillary Clinton is he is a more centrist, more moderate Democrat. She is reinforcing her prior brand before she reinvented herself as a Bernie bro. She's going back to the old thing. He's from a swing state. He is...KELLY: But she is saying, hey, you disaffected Republicans, here I am. Look who I picked. I didn't go with Elizabeth Warren. This guy, you might like.STIREWALT: I think that's part of it and I think the other part of it is she has returned to normalcy just as tapioca, bland as she possibly can be, just saying, I'm here. Donald Trump's unacceptable. I am -- you may not like me, but I am not going to cause any real problems. I'm going to be sort of steady and stable.KELLY: I don't know why you rip on tapioca all the time. Nanna, who is 100 years old...STIREWALT: I like tapioca.KELLY: ...she loves tapioca. That was one of the highlights of going to visit to her, like thank you. She loves the tapioca. Why do you always rip it like that?STIREWALT: I'm pro-tapioca. I stand here as a person who likes uninteresting things, but I'm just saying for Hillary Clinton...KELLY: You only like tapioca if it has bacon bits in it...STIREWALT: She did not go for the cayenne (ph) thing (ph).KELLY: ...that's it. That's it. Otherwise, forget it.STIREWALT: Then I would do it.KELLY: Stirewalt, we'll see you in Philly.STIREWALT: See you soon.KELLY: Well, Hillary Clinton just days away now from accepting her party's nomination, Dinesh D'Souza premieres a new film this weekend called ""Hillary's America"" -- ""Hillary's America."" And just ahead, he will take on the growing backlash that's already rising from the film's critics.Plus we'll take you behind the scenes for one of the most dramatic moments of the 2016 Republican National Convention when Mark McKinnon, one of our favorites, joins us next with some exclusive footage.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, I've become a little bit of a student of your public persona. You seemed a little shaken -- emotional.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know what, I actually was. That doesn't happen often.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, they actually, it very rarely happens.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, just 24 hours after Donald Trump became the leader of the Republican Party and we are seeing new video of what went on behind the scenes at the RNC. The Showtime series, ""The Circus"" had cameras rolling when Donald Trump, Jr. had the honor of announcing the vote of the New York delegation securing his father's nomination. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: New York, the Empire State, proud to be the home of Donald J. Trump, and we are proud that we have as one of our delegates Donald J. Trump Jr.(APPLAUSE)DONALD TRUMP, JR., SON OF DONALD TRUMP: I have the incredible honor to be able to throw Donald Trump over the top in the delegate count tonight with 89 delegates. Congratulations, dad. We love you!(APPLAUSE)(CHANTING)(CROSSTALK)D. TRUMP, JR.: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations.D. TRUMP, JR.: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Great job.D. TRUMP, JR.: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What was it like, man?D. TRUMP, JR.: Other than the birth of my children, it was the coolest thing I've ever done. It's surreal. Totally intense.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don, why don't you go in the room?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hold on.D. TRUMP, JR.: Hey, how are you?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Guys, can you just give us two minutes?(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now you can't say anything.(CROSSTALK)PAUL MANAFORT, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: This convention is totally in Trump (ph) (inaudible). There were a number of delegations and they were helping...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And since you want to vote for the best (ph) president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations.D. TRUMP, JR.: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So I've become a little bit of a student of your public persona. You seemed a little shaken -- emotional.D. TRUMP, JR.: You know what, I actually was. That doesn't happen often.(CROSSTALK)D. TRUMP, JR.: It actually -- it very rarely happens.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, seven things happened yesterday that was controversy including your stepmother's speech. Are you all...D. TRUMP, JR.: Honestly...(CROSSTALK)D. TRUMP, JR.: Really, you know, it's not even anything to block out. You know, whatever happened, happened. I think more importantly than anything, she got on that stage in front of all those people, she delivered an awesome message. I mean for me, it's nothing about the words or whatever it maybe (ph). Everyone delivers words.Everyone has somebody that writes something for them and they read it, but she actually cognizantly tries to avoid that. She wants to be a mom. She wants to take care of her son. So to get out there and out herself -- I was more concerned about the delivery. I was just thinking like, it's such a good way (ph). I was actually really impressed. I mean, that's what I take on that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations.D. TRUMP, JR.: Thank you.(CROSSTALK)D. TRUMP, JR.: Now that I'm big time, mark, I'm too good for cable now.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Premium cable.D. TRUMP, JR.: Premium cable.(INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: What's he got against cable? What's wrong with cable? Mark McKinnon is the former chief media adviser to President George W. Bush and co- creator of ""The Circus.""MARK MCKINNON, PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH FORMER CHIEF MEDIA ADVISER: Premium cable.KELLY: There we go. And as you can see, Mark had a front-row seat to all the convention drama. Look at it. I love how you dress the part. So that was an exciting moment to be with the Trump family and with Donald Jr. in particular.MCKINNON: It was an exciting moment. It's a unique moment. It's a human moment. These are the kind of things we try to capture on the surface. The human drama to show what happens off the stage. And you don't see a lot of emotional stuff with the Trumps.They're usually pretty cool customers, and Donald, I was with him in Elko when he gave his first speech back during the primary. And it's really fun to kind of watch his evolution. He's a big talent.KELLY: Don Jr.MCKINNON: Don Jr. He's a big talent. But this moment, you could see he got really pumped up and kind of excited, you know, kind of amped up, but to be there and do that for his father, that was a family thing. That wasn't just politics. That was where you kind of see the sort of thing that you would with your family or I would.To have this moment that they worked for so hard and he got to put him over the top and call his dad and say, hey, dad, we did it.KELLY: Do you know what his dad said to him on the phone?MCKINNON: Donald Jr. said, you know, thanks, we did this together. It was a great moment.KELLY: What did you think of the RNC this week? How did they do?MCKINNON: Well, the important point we always say is that the thing that really matters is last night's speech. There was a lot of drama. I was with you on the set -- on your set when the Ted Cruz moment happened, which was the most dramatic thing I've ever seen in all of the conventions that I've been going to since `78.KELLY: Wow.MCKINNON: That was wild, and I think we're still trying to figure out where all the shrapnel hit on that one. But again, that all kind of got wiped away. The plagiarism thing got wiped away by the speech on Thursday night because he stood and he delivered, and just from the sort of, you know, the adviser guy that I used to be, looking at that, here's my takeaway.The bottom line is you want people to walk away from a speech like that clear on what the message was. And in that case, that's 100 percent A-plus. I mean, there's no -- there's no confusion about what Donald Trump's message was that night. You know, it's -- it's -- I'm going to make you safer. Crime and punishment. We're living in dangerous times and I'm going to do something about it. And that was like a whole hour of his speech.Often these speeches are kind of alphabet soup. It was clear what he was saying. It was not a soaring, poetic speech. It was blunt force prose. And it was not a Peggy Noonan and Mike Pearson (ph) speech but he was clear what the message was, and he's tapping into a -- all this all election's been tapping into a psyche and a lot of people...KELLY: But I want to ask you this. So, points on the message and points on strength and points on being, you know, Trump, but then why did he do this, this morning? This is what he -- he got back on the Ted Cruz thing. You know how he said Ted Cruz's dad...MCKINNON: Back on the ""National Enquirer"" on the JFK assassination.KELLY: I don't know, killed JFK or helped -- I don't know what he, you know, something bad. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: All I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the ""National Enquirer"" there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast. Now, Ted never denied that it was his father. It was a picture on the front page of the ""National Enquirer"" which does have credibility.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Why is he talking about that? Why isn't he talking about his speech?MCKINNON: He's not going to stay on the leash. He's not going to ever stay on the leash. And that's what makes him fascinating and entertaining. That's why people keep tuning in because they know that it's never going to be predictable, ever.KELLY: But does that take the air out of some of the sails, one minute talking about that instead of law and order and immigration?MCKINNON: Yeah. I mean, that's just not conventional by any standard. It's not what any candidate has ever done, but he did the same thing and won all the primaries. It's like watching a car wreck.KELLY: It's true. And it's kind of -- it's more interesting to talk about.(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Or just a high-speed car chase.MCKINNON: Yeah, we watch it to see the crash.KELLY: Great to see you Mark McKinnon. Danesh D'Souza and his new documentary, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza became a nationally known name with the release of his documentary ""Obama's America"" back in 2012. And now the conservative filmmaker is at it again. His film ""Hillary's America"" premieres on 1,300 screens this weekend and here's a sneak peek.(BEGIN VICEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Democrats today claim to be the party of progress. But where's the progress? For blacks, they've created new urban plantations, for Indians, reservations and for poor immigrants, barrios, ghettos, and slums. They put their voters in there and make sure they stay there. The only progress we see is progress for them.More wealth, more power, more control over America and over our lives. The Clintons are worthy successors of a tradition from Andrew Jackson through Woodrow Wilson. Are we not done with this larcenous duo? How much these partners in crime have already stolen from us. How much more will we let them take?CLINTON: Some candidates in this race are resorting to ugly, hateful rhetoric.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hateful rhetoric? The Clintons are hateful people with a hateful history. Imagine how much worse things could get if these two depraved crooks return to the White House.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ""Hillary's America"" in theaters now.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: So you're saying you're a maybe. Joining me now, filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza and Nomiki Kontz who's a Bernie Sanders supporter, host of ""The Filter,"" great to see you both. Dinesh, woo, wow! Larcenous duo. I don't know where to begin. And your point is?DINESH D'SOUZA, FILMMAKER: Well, my point is that people need some vaccination or inoculation against the propaganda viruses that are going to be unleashed at the Democratic Convention next week. We're going to be hearing how the Democratic Party is the party of the little guy, of minorities, of Latinos, of immigrants.How the Democrats have fought for civil rights and human rights, and what we do in this movie is we blow the lid off of all that and we show the Democratic Party has actually been the party of exploitation, subjugation, theft, and murder. And we do it based upon facts that really can't be denied, which was the party of slavery, of segregation, of forced sterilization, of Jim Crow, of the Ku Klux Klan.This is the Democratic Party and the subjugation and exploitation continues today. That's probably the punch line of the movie, but this is not a thing of the past, but many of the ugliest features of history continue to haunt the Democratic Party now.KELLY: Nomiki?NOMIKI KONTZ, BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER: This movie is no ""Citizen Kane."" It's a parody, of a parody, of a parody, of a conspiracy theory movie. Listen, I wish -- I wish the Democratic Party was that powerful. But the reality is, I mean, the Republican Party has the house, they have the senate. They have every single state pretty much controlled in the legislature.And listen, if Hillary Clinton was so powerful, and really (inaudible) she had two Super PACS, had 470 super delegates stacked up a year before she was running for office. She had Debbie Wasserman Schultz running the DNC, her former chair. She had more money than God, and yet this like socialist from Vermont was able to get 46 percent of the vote in pretty close primaries.So, if she were that powerful, I mean listen, like I'm not the biggest Hillary Clinton supporter, but she's not as powerful as you think she is, and I'm sure you're making a lot of money off this movie. It's a good time to be in electoral politics for documentary film making.KELLY: Well, of course it did come out today that not only did she have a lot of power but she had some friends in high places because these leaked DNC e-mails reveal that the Democratic National Committee was putting its thumb on the scale for her over Bernie Sanders, talking about how they were going to plan a narrative that his campaign was a mess.One comment that isn't -- specifically doesn't mention him but talks about questioning a candidate's religion, does he believes in God or is he an atheist? My southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist. I mean this is dicey stuff.D'SOUZA: Megyn, I think the -- I think the issue, Megyn, is not whether Hillary Clinton is powerful individually or as a person, but rather that Hillary Clinton is head of the gang, progressive gang, the Democratic Party gang, and these are guys who are very powerful, particularly they control the inner city neighborhoods which have been some of the most troubled spots in America.Look at inner city Oakland or Detroit or Chicago. Now, these are places that are kind of urban plantations, and what I mean by that is they resemble the old slave plantations, ramshackle dwellings, a great deal of violence necessary to keep the place under control.KELLY: Dinesh, I mean, there's no question that we have problems in the inner city, but Nomiki, Dinesh puts it all on the dems.D'SOUZA: Well, there aren't any republicans around.KELLY: That one is for Nomiki.D'SOUZA: Aren't these inner cities run by Democratic mayors?KELLY: All right, let her respond to that.KONTZ: No. And a lot of these inner cities have had privatization policies. Listen, Hillary Clinton is no progressive. I don't know what land you're living in. Hillary Clinton is about as corporate centrist as you can get. She picks Tim Kaine who basically is the identical version of her as a man.I mean you can't get any more centrist and appealing to moderate Republicans than Hillary Clinton. I mean if this were actually something as rooted in philosophical values as progressives, then maybe you'd have a case. But that doesn't match her policies.KELLY: Got to leave it at that.KONST: I think this is all over the place.KELLY: And you can catch Dinesh's movie in theaters with the popcorn this weekend. Just a reminder, live in Philadelphia all next week. Back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So don't forget to tune in next week. ""The Kelly File"" will be live in Philly for the Democratic National Convention. You can count on complete coverage of the big speeches and the moments you don't want to miss.
