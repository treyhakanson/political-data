Walker: We will prevail in June 5th recall	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" April 20, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.STUART VARNEY, GUEST HOST: To the war in Wisconsin.As the recall fight against Republican Governor Scott Walker kicks up, his reforms are kicking in. And now property tax bills are ticking down. That's the first time in 12 years that has happened. And the governor says what he is doing is working.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOV. SCOTT WALKER, R-WIS.: The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel just this week wrote an editorial comment on their blog that talked about how the decrease in property taxes that we have experienced that we have not had in years is directly because of our reforms and will continue to be a stark contrast to both of my main opponents, who say they are going to lift the caps on property taxes should they be elected governor.VARNEY: Now, I know you have heard this before, but I'm going to repeat it. The teachers say that because of you, they are going to have to pay more towards their pensions, that you are going to reopen existing contracts and renegotiate them, and teachers are going to get less and that you are taking it out on them.And your response again?WALKER: Not at all. In fact, I have two sons, a junior and a senior, who go to public school right here in the state of Wisconsin.Their school, because of our reforms, is actually to hire more teachers, like a lot of schools across the state. They use savings out there to hire more teachers and to lower classroom sizes. In many cases, many of our school districts are actually able to set money aside to pay based on performance to reward excellence in education.So, yes, public employees like myself and others are paying a little bit more for pensions and a little bit more for health insurance premiums, but still far less than the middle-class taxpayers in our state, the very people I am standing up to protect.VARNEY: OK.Mitch Daniel, a Republican governor in Indiana, yesterday endorsed Romney. John Kasich, Republican governor Ohio, today endorsed Mitt Romney.Scott Walker, Republican governor Wisconsin, Mitt Romney, when?WALKER: I think Mitt Romney is a great guy. I think he is a great turnaround agent, what he did for companies, for our country in the Olympics, and what he could do as president would be outstanding.But between now and June 5, I am totally focused on making sure we win here in the state of Wisconsin and we will talk after that about the presidential sweepstakes. But for now, I owe it to the people of Wisconsin, the majority of people who voted me the first time, to stay completely focused and devoted to what we're doing here in our state.VARNEY: Now, that's the June 5 recall election. And they have -- your opponents, the Democrats, have not decided on one single candidate to run against you and I believe they have a primary in the month of May.WALKER: That's right.VARNEY: But that is an open primary, isn't it, Governor? Republicans could actually vote in it. Is there an opportunity there for a little mischief on the part of the Republicans?(LAUGHTER) WALKER: Well, there is some who have talked about it. And May 8 is their primary.But Kathleen Falk or Tom Barrett, the two main Democrats, both of them are, really, almost running over each other to see who can pander most to the radical left and to the big government union bosses in our state. They both in this last week talked about repealing the caps and property taxes, those caps you started out by talking about that for the first time in more than a decade have brought us true property tax relief and actual reduction of property taxes, and they are pandering to see who can be the biggest defender of the big government union bosses.We took the power away from those handful and instead put it in the hands of the hardworking taxpayers of our state. In either case, our opponent is not going to be the person on the ballot. It's going to be the out-of-state money from the big government union bosses and that is why we are hoping people help us out at ScottWalker.org to counter that message at the grassroots level.VARNEY: Do you have a lot of money pouring in from out-of-state? I know that the Democrats have a lot of union money coming in from out-of- state. You have a lot of out-of-state money, too, I think.WALKER: Well, the people from all across my state and all across the country have helped us out.In fact, our last report showed that more than 76 percent of our donations came from people who gave me $50 or less. That is people who go to our Web site at ScottWalker.org and click off and give us $25 or $30 or $40 at a time. But that really makes a difference because that makes up for the literally tens of millions of dollars that is coming in from out- of-state from the big government unions.They spent it last year trying to take out our Supreme Court justice and they spent it trying to change the vote last spring and they spent it last summer trying to take out six of our Republican state senators who also face recalled elections.We ultimate prevailed in each of those races. And I believe we will prevail again now on June 5. But we are going to need a lot of grassroots support.VARNEY: I hear that when you go out-of-state, like Oklahoma, you, sir, are a rock star. I hear you were virtually mobbed just the other day, is that right?(LAUGHTER) WALKER: Well, I have got two high school sons who would laugh at me being called a rock star.I think when I go to Summerfest, the world's largest music festival, here in Wisconsin; they think I go to the old fogies' stand. So rock star is not exactly the phrase I would use.(CROSSTALK) VARNEY: You're popular with conservatives. And I'm wondering are you therefore on a short list or any list for vice president?WALKER: I have got a big list of things that need to be done here to continue to get our state working again. And so I think if anyone out of Wisconsin is on a short list, it is my friend Paul Ryan, who would make an exceptional vice president, not just as a candidate, but more so in office. He is brilliant. He's one of the boldest people I know.VARNEY: Would you reject it? Would you just flatly...(CROSSTALK)WALKER: Well, again, I...VARNEY: You would totally reject it? Would you?WALKER: I would advise Mitt Romney if he wanted to pick someone great from Wisconsin, Paul Ryan is the best pick out there, no doubt about it.VARNEY: If drafted, I will not run. If nominated, I will not accept. If elected, I will not serve.Will you make a Shermanesque categorical rejection?WALKER: No.VARNEY: No.(LAUGHTER) WALKER: In my case, I will stay focused on Wisconsin.Our bottom line is, after June 5, I think people who are going to help us win this election want me to get through this and get the job done. We will leave national politics up to people like Paul Ryan.VARNEY: But just let me go back to Paul Ryan for a second. You support him for vice president, and you support his policies? You like his budget?WALKER: Absolutely. Well, I think he's brilliant.I think part of the reason why we have gotten such great response not only from conservative groups, but I was just at a factory this morning -- from factor workers and from farmers and from small business owners around my state, is because they understand we have done in our state, and continue to do, what people have complained about for years.And that is politicians routinely getting in office and fail to have the courage to take on the tough issues we all know need to be taken on. Paul Ryan is doing it in Washington and we have done it here in Wisconsin. I believe voters of both our state and at the national level are looking for people of courage to stand up and worry about the next generation more than we worry about the next election. And that's why I support Paul for being a great person to put on the ticket and it's why I'm hoping voters will continue to support me here in the great state of Wisconsin.VARNEY: Governor Scott Walker thanks for joining us, sir. Appreciate it.WALKER: Stuart, good to be with you.(END VIDEOTAPE) VARNEY: All right.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, Inc. Copyright CQ-2012 Roll Call, Inc.

4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/04/16/taxing-rich/	Taxing the rich	"This is a rush transcript from ""Journal Editorial Report,"" April 14, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.STUART VARNEY, FOX HOST: This week on the ""Journal Editorial Report,"" taxing the rich. President Obama says it's only fair. His ""Buffett rule"" may be good politics, but is it bad policy? And weekly job numbers. Payday bleak employment picture. Is it a bump in the road or is the economic recovery headed off a cliff?And with his chief Republican rival out, Mitt Romney looks to the general election. What he needs to do to take on the president and win.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What Ronald Reagan was calling for then is the same thing we're calling for now, a return to basic fairness and responsibility, everybody doing their part.(END VIDEO CLIP)VARNEY: Welcome to the ""Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Stuart Varney, in this week for Paul Gigot.Well, you just heard President Obama invoking Ronald Reagan, and claiming that his latest plan to tax the rich is all about fairness. The president officially endorsed the so-called ""Buffett rule"" in the swing state of Florida Tuesday, calling for a minimum 30 percent tax on those making more than a million dollars a year. His campaign clearly thinks it is a political winner, but is it good policy?Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; columnist, Mary Anastasia O'Grady; assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman; and Washington columnist, Kim Strassel.Dan, to you first. I call this class warfare.DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Uh-huh.VARNEY: I know something about that. Is this a winning political strategy?HENNINGER: Let's put it this way, Stuart, invoking Ronald Reagan in this context really takes the cake. We'll get to that later. But bear in mind that the first time around with the Obama rule, it wasn't about basic fairness. It was about reducing the deficit. As the president said, it's simple math. Well, somebody did the arithmetic, and it turns out, it adds up to about $5 billion a year, a teardrop in denting the deficit. Then we shifted to basic fairness.I think the problem with that is he's running in a way that induces resentment on the part of some voters. I don't think most people carry resentment and fairness in their head all the time, but he's going to have to sustain that by giving these class warfare speeches. While it may work, I don't think it's a winning strategy. I don't think he can build a majority on that basis. Some people will respond, but I don't think enough.VARNEY: Kim, I want to stay with the political angle for a second. In America, does class warfare win?KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Well, look, the president's doing this for two reasons. One is because he just doesn't have anything else to run on. The economy's not great. His record is not strong. He's also doing it because he views this as a weak spot for Mitt Romney, who is a bit sensitive about his own wealth. The problem is if you ask Americans in the abstract, do they think millionaires and billionaires should pay more, they say yes. More interesting, though, are the polls that say, what do you think is the most important issue? They do not believe this is the most important issue. They want a president who's going to tell them how he's going to fix the economy, what he's going to do fix the deficit. So the question is, do you motivate people to go to the polls on this issue? Can you win as a president running on higher taxes? That's a bigger gamble.VARNEY: Which brings us to the question of whether or not this is good economic policy.But look, the premise of the president's position is that this is fair, this is fairness. Is it, Mary?MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, COLUMNIST: Well, if the question is paying your fair share, it certainly is not. I mean, the top 1 percent of earners in this country already pay about 40 percent of the taxes. The top 5 percent pay almost 60 percent of the taxes. And the bottom 50 percent pay less than 3 percent of the taxes. So if it's about paying your fair share, that's already happening. What the president is doing here is getting at something else, which is very common in Latin America, equality. He wants everybody to be equal. He thinks that that's a resounding message to the American voter. I don't think it is.VARNEY: James?JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Well, just to clarify, this is not what Ronald Reagan was calling for.VARNEY: Thank you.FREEMAN: Amazing. This week, the White House using the 1986 tax reform as somehow connecting it to the ""Buffett rule"" -- the '86 tax reform under Reagan was cutting rates, lower deductions, simplifying taxes. What President Obama is proposing here, no elimination of deductions, no simplification, no rate cuts, increasing taxes on capital gains. So it's really the exact opposite. I think you have to wonder, good policy, is it a growth strategy to say we are going to tax equity investment more?VARNEY: In your judgment, is it good economic policy?(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: It can't be. We're sitting here with all these nervous investors, scared companies, individuals sitting on cash, investing in long-term treasury bonds instead of taking risks. This is an arrow right at that risk-taking to say we'll make it more expensive to invest in equities.HENNINGER: Yes, and to James' point, what's so fascinating about the president's presentation, especially invoking Reagan, is he himself does not even talk about the growth aspects of this tax policy. Did anyone hear him talking about how his tax policy was going to promote economic growth? Reagan did it all the time. Barack Obama isn't even talking about that, which is obviously the primary issue in the center of the campaign. It's really kind of amazing that he doesn't somehow try to make a case for how this is going to improve the economy.VARNEY: Kim, I think it's going to be voted on next week in the Senate. How much Democrat support will it get?STRASSEL: Well, they have brought this issue up several times in the Senate before. It's never actually passed. I think you touch on another risk for Democrats. Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is starting to get a real reputation of overseeing a graveyard. There are growing complaints that the House Republicans have passed dozens of pieces of legislation. There are even bills that President Barack Obama says he supports, that Senate Democrats support, but Harry Reid has had no time to debate any of those or bring them to the floor, because they're holding show votes like this, legislation that's not going to pass, but is all designed for the political campaign this fall.VARNEY: All designed for the political campaign this fall. I have to keep going back to that question. Does class warfare win politically in America? I understand that in the past it has not. This year, Kim, do you think it's a winning issue, politically?STRASSEL: I don't. They're going to try, again, because they don't have much else. The only way they might win this is if Mitt Romney does not actually respond on this. This is the president drawing a line in the sand, saying this is what we are going to fight over. If Mitt Romney decides to agree with him and continues saying things like, well, the rich can take care of themselves, he sees that issue. He has to go out and make the argument that lower tax rates for all are what create jobs and economic growth. If he can't do that, then the Republicans have a problem.O'GRADY: You know, I think Kim is absolutely right on that. This is an opportunity for Romney. I mean, here is a president, going after the single most important group of people who can create jobs, who can give us capital formation, who can give us growth, and Romney has to make that very clear, because if the president just sails through on this resentment issue, I think it's going to be very tough.VARNEY: Last word.FREEMAN: You can't hit the ""Buffett rule."" It's a political sham. It doesn't raise money. Warren Buffett is not going to be affected by it, because he has bragged by shielding his wealth from capital gains taxes. It's not even going to hit Buffett that hard.VARNEY: I want the last word --(LAUGHTER)-- class warfare does not work in America.(LAUGHTER)Still ahead, troubling new job numbers this week. Are they a sign of a new economic downturn or is the recovery still on track?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)VARNEY: New applications for unemployment benefits jumped sharply last week, to their highest level since January, yet another sign that the jobs picture is worsening. So what about the rest of the economy? Is the recovery on track or heading off the rails?James, what do you say?FREEMAN: I think we're continuing to bump along. I don't think you can say we're sliding into recession. Just to continue with the Reagan theme and making comparisons, one thing that's disturbing during the Reagan years, real disposable personal income was growing 10 times the rate of the Obama era. We actually in the early part of this year are seeing real disposable income, what people have after taxes, adjusted for inflation, shrinking.(CROSSTALK)VARNEY: This is very important to the average voter. The cash in their pocket --FREEMAN: That's right.VARNEY: -- after taxes, the money in their pocket, that's come down this year?FREEMAN: It's actually shrinking in January and February. It's basically a little -- slightly positive last year. But to the average person it's just not the crummy employment numbers we've seen, it's the cash in the pocket, which isn't there.VARNEY: Mary, we've got the greater growth slowing down, we understand, in the first quarter of this year, job recreation rate cut in half, the unemployment rate still above 8 percent. Now, do you think we're headed to recession?O'GRADY: I don't think we're going to have a recession. I agree with James, that we're just going to sort of bump along the bottom. But, you know, this week there was an interesting survey out from a very important group of job creators in this country, small business owners, who are members of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and they did a survey. The March results were very discouraging. Nine out of 10 sectors that they surveyed on, business owners were more pessimistic about the economy. They did not expect to be adding staff. They did not -- they found that -- difficult to hire jobs, those job openings were -- were not really growing. They were worried about inflation. They were worried about poor sales. They were worried about taxes, overregulation. It was a very negative picture. And these are the people on the frontline, and they are the most important job creators in the country.VARNEY: That's a pretty long laundry list you had there.Dan?HENNINGER: To Mary's point, recession occur because of investor pessimism. Investors get pessimistic, they withdraw from the economy. Recoveries occur because of investor confidence. The economy starts growing again. We cannot say that investors have confidence right now for the reasons you just heard. They're slightly depressed.In terms of the recovery, I think there are two parts of that going on. Recovery is occurring in terms of corporate profits. American corporations are very dynamic, very strong. They're very good at adjusting. We are not having a recovery in the employment market. We are not creating new jobs. I think that's the part of the recovery that most voters are looking at. The corporate profit in this case, they're not falling into their pockets, they're falling into the bottom line for shareholders. That's good, but we're not getting the jobs we should be getting in a real recovery.VARNEY: In each of the last two years, we've seen the green chutes of recovery trampled on. Are we seeing the same thing this year, third year in a row?FREEMAN: Third year in a row, early part of the year, there's good news, then it tails off. I don't know. I think it's possible you see a modest improvement as we go into the fall. That's I don't think we -- politically, I'm not sure Mitt Romney can count on a terrible economy when people vote.(CROSSTALK)VARNEY: A two percent growth rate. Supposing we get to that in the summer and fall? That's not where America ought to be.FREEMAN: No.VARNEY: That's not the feeling you should have in America three years after the end of a recession, is it?FREEMAN: No, it isn't. It's historically bad when you look at other deep recessions. Usually there's a big snap-back, a big rebound. That's why it's discouraging seeing that story on the income.(CROSSTALK)O'GRADY: There's concern about inflation out there. The Fed says there's no inflation, but the -- the Fed --(CROSSTALK)VARNEY: Gas prices, food prices?O'GRADY: The regional banks say that when they survey the people who live in their districts, those people are worried about inflation.And the other thing about the Fed that's interesting is, you know, Ben Bernanke has every motivation to be talk up the economy. Yet, when they talk to him, he's a very nervous guy. I mean, he says this is not anything that he's very confident about.VARNEY: Dan, I've got a smile on my face, because I've lived in America for nearly 40 years. The feeling that I always got from America was of a robust, lively, vigorous, go-ahead, knock-them-flat economy.(LAUGHTER)I do. That's the feeling I got.HENNINGER: Yes!VARNEY: I don't get that feeling now, Dan.HENNINGER: Because it's not there. It's because Barack Obama is not giving it the wherewithal to do that. If he wanted to do one single thing to revive the economy, he would put a reduction in the corporate tax rate on the table. He could get that passed. Is that happening? No, it isn't. Instead we're getting the ""Buffett rule.""FREEMAN: I think that economy you want, that we've always enjoyed, it's there, it's being restrained. It's kind of like a car idling right now, ready to roar, but these are very healthy companies. So if you take away some of the Washington pressure and uncertainty, I think the good times can come back.VARNEY: Well, you know, we all agree that the economic outlook is indeed far from rosy. And that may be the president's biggest challenge heading into November. But can Mitt Romney step up and make the case, not only against Obama's economic policies, but for his own? Our panel weighs in on that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)VARNEY: With Rick Santorum bowing out of the Republican race, Mitt Romney can finally turn his attention to the fall fight against President Obama. If this week is any indication, it's shaping up to be quite a brawl. So what will the November election turn on? Will it be the so- called war on women? Will it be the economy? Or what?Kim, you know, the economy has taken a lot of attention this week, but I've got to say that the fight over women, that holds center stage now, doesn't it?STRASSEL: Yes, does it. Although -- this is -- the way I look at this, Stuart, is this is the first of many flashpoints and hullabaloos you're going to see from now until November, a fight over an issue like this. It's worthwhile stepping back and seeing what we have now that Rick Santorum has left the primary, which means Mitt Romney is the presumptive for the GOP. You've got a president who, in many ways, is a very weak president. He's got deficit problems. The economy is not great. People don't love his record. You have Mitt Romney who has his own challenges. We're now going to get a sense of what those are.One of these and why the White House was pushing this issue of women is the fact that he is relatively weak compared to the president in terms of women voters. The way he solves this is the way he solved some of his other problems with other areas of the electorate, and that's to start spending time for a very compelling reason for his own presidency, not just reasons for why Barack Obama should not be re-elected.VARNEY: Dan, do you think that the prominence of the women's vote will fade?HENNINGER: Yes, as a matter of fact I do think it will fade, as the Romney strategy for the presidential run rather than the primary run begins to emerge at least. He's going to have to make a case for the economy and the economic benefits of a strong economy to women. But he also has to run against, kind of what Kim was suggesting, a president that's not going to run on his record, but instead is going to run on pretty much what I'd call a negative campaign. He's going to say, Mitt Romney, why are you against fairness for the middle class?(LAUGHTER)Why are you against women? What is your problem with poor people? Why are you just for the rich? All of these kind of unanswerable questions that have resonance, and people go, yes, why is he?(LAUGHTER)He's going to have to come back and talk about that 2 percent growth rate, 8 percent unemployment, and what happened on Barack Obama's economic watch, because the president is doing everything he can to keep that off the table.VARNEY: Well, there's a poll out, and it shows that -- the question was asked, did the Obama team's policies help or hurt the economy. 37 percent said it hurt the economy, has hurt. Only 31 percent said those policies have helped the economy.James, that sounds like that is a gift to Romney to run on the economy.FREEMAN: Right. I think --(CROSSTALK)VARNEY: But he's got to do it --(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: That's right. He's got to play offense. He's in trouble if he spends the whole campaign reacting to President Obama raising the issue of whether women ought to get in the Augusta National Golf Club --(LAUGHTER)-- or whether the Lilly Ledbetter Law in fair pay was a good idea. Romney has to set the agenda and talk about both freedom and economic growth. On the freedom question, which he has a lot of room to run there with women, Independent women don't love Obamacare. They don't necessarily like the federal government dictating more of their health care choices. So there's a lot of material here, but Romney has to play offense and raise the issues.VARNEY: Kim, you're in D.C. I've got to put this question to you. It doesn't seem to me that looking back over this past week it was Mitt Romney that carried forward the attack. I thought it was Ann Romney, who was very classy in defense of the attack on her. She seems to be leading that campaign.STRASSEL: Well, she is. And part of this, Stuart, is this all happened, Democratic political operative Hilary Rosen stepped into the middle of mommy wars. Big mistake why anyone would ever do that. You cannot win in that. Ann Romney has been a very effective advocate for Mitt Romney, both in softening his image. The attack on her just teed her up to go out there and make headway on this. To the extent that we're stuck in some of these roundabout questions, like the mommy wars, that aren't necessarily about the economy, this wasn't the best move by Democrats. But she's going to be a very forceful presence for him in this campaign. You saw that this week with her response to all of that.VARNEY: Dan, James? Have you yet seen Mitt Romney come out of his corner and start attacking, taking the initiative? Have we seen it yet?HENNINGER: Yes. I think we saw it in the two victory speeches over the most recent primary. They were very strong. The last one I found very little to disagree with. So I think his message is coming together. But I think what he's really going have to do -- because it's a message about the economy, and that can get a little bit complicated. And Obama is running against the Romneys as a rich couple, and him as a rich businessman. Mitt Romney has to find a way to talk as though he's sitting around a kitchen table with a middle class couple, explaining it to them, in very simple terms, how this is going to affect them.VARNEY: Just like Ronald Reagan did.HENNINGER: Yes.VARNEY: All right.We have to take one more break. When we come back, our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)VARNEY: All right. It's time for ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.Kim, you're first.STRASSEL: This is a hit to the slow but ever-churning wheels of justice, which, this week, began a federal trial against John Edwards. Mr. Edwards is, of course, the Democratic Senator. He ran for president in 2008. He lost. He had since been indicted for misusing campaign funds to conceal an extramarital affair. The irony, of course, is that Mr. Edwards knows his way well around the courtroom. He became a Senator on his reputation as a hot-shot trial lawyer, one who incidentally ought to note law. Now, of course, a jury will decide his guilt or innocence, and we hope for a fair trial. But it's comforting to know that the justice is not beyond -- does not close its eyes to everyone, even trial lawyers.VARNEY: Dan, it is your turn.HENNINGER: Well, a big swing and a miss to Ozzie Guillen, who is the manager of the Miami Marlins -- Miami being the greatest collection of Cuban refugees and Cuban Americans in America -- who earlier in the week, said, I respect Fidel Castro. You know why, a lot of people have wanted to kill Fidel Castro. For 60 years, that son-of-a-gun is still here. Well, this didn't play so well. When Hollywood figures say this sort of thing, everybody goes, yes, so what do they know, no big deal. In Miami, they do know.VARNEY: What was he thinking?James?FREEMAN: This is a big hit to Rick Santorum for running a great campaign without a lot of money but making the case for freedom, and doing it with eloquence and a lot of passion, and making Mitt Romney a better candidate, and forcing him to embrace growth economics. So a hit for Rick Santorum.VARNEY: You did it in perfect time. Excellent, James.Just excellent, Dan and Kim.(LAUGHTER)That's for it this week's show. Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching. I'm Stuart Varney. You can catch me weekdays on ""Varney & Co."" on the Fox Business network, 9:20 eastern each week day. Paul's back next week. We all hope to see you then.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
