Civil rights activists, led by Dr. King, appealed to the conscience and good will of the nation on the issue and won the nation over.In America, one of the worst things that can be said of anyone is that he or she is racist. The charge is so potent that some -- Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton come to mind -- have hurled it about with abandon, knowing how far people will go to avoid the label.But the accusation should be wielded with the most extreme care, supported by abundant evidence.Which brings us to the case of Joe Wilson, the back-bench Republican congressman, who called Barack Obama a liar to his face in the House chamber last week. He apologized and he should have and it wouldn't hurt him to do it again.But now Wilson stands accused of -- you guessed it -- racism.Democratic Congressman Johnson's talk of people donning ""white hoods"" encouraged by Wilson is but one example. A noted New York Times columnist said over the weekend that Wilson could not accept that a black man is president. She said she heard Wilson use the word ""boy,"" in his outburst -- though she admits he did not say that. That, it seems, is her evidence.People have wondered if President Obama would play the race card to answer his critics. He has not. It is being done for him.-- Brit Hume is the senior political analyst for FOX News Channel."

This must be a product of internal domestic development in a society. But if the U.S. were to leave and abandon Iraq without establishing the grounds for a united country, that would definitely be a second mistake.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, HOST: That from ""60 Minutes"" last night, Vladimir Putin. The president meanwhile arrived in the former Soviet republic of Georgia tonight following V-Day observances in Moscow in which he and Soviet President Putin were outwardly very friendly, but against the backdrop of Putin sounding positively nostalgic for the age of Stalin and the heyday of the Soviet Empire.So what is up here? For answers, we turn to Steven Sestanovich, a veteran diplomat and policy specialist on Russia and its neighbors who is now a professor at Columbia University.Good evening. Welcome.STEVEN SESTANOVICH, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: Thanks.HUME: How do you interpret -- Putin has said a number of things lately. You heard him just there complaining about Iraq policy, which we knew he disagreed with. He also talked about the fall of the Soviet Union being a catastrophe, not merely a strategic retreat, but a catastrophe, as if it was a loss to the world.He clearly is unhappy about the visit to Georgia. He didn't like the visits to the Baltics. He repeated the old idea that the Russian occupation of the Baltics was by invitation during the post-World War II era. What's going on?SESTANOVICH: Well, Putin has got an anniversary on his hands, and he's trying to satisfy a lot of constituencies and look as though -- this is an occasion that reminds people that Russia is a powerful force. If you ask Russian domestic analysts why he is evoking Stalin, they will say, ""Oh, it's to appeal to the old folks.""I think it's clear there is a little bit of his own sentiment at work here, you know, the KGB alumnus who has kind of an appreciation of the way in which the old guy was able to establish order. There was even a little nostalgia in that car ride that he and Bush took.HUME: It was a 1956 Volga?SESTANOVICH: Well, strictly speaking, the Khrushchev era, of course. But the nostalgia for Soviet times is actually relatively strong in Russian politics.HUME: Well, why? I mean, is it because things were less chaotic then or they all had bread, or things are hard now, or democracy is difficult? What?SESTANOVICH: It's been a chaotic 15 years. And Putin has been able to present himself as the guy who is ending that chaos. You know, you didn't like the steady depreciation of the ruble, you didn't like the uncertainty of whether you would actually have a job, you didn't like uncertainty about whether Russia was a significant international force?His program is, ""I'm offering you a reversal of all of that."" You didn't like Yeltsin because he was sort of old and out of it? ""I'm a young, sober guy who can talk sternly to the president of the United States.""HUME: Is there a sense that the Russian people, having had the long history they have had, first under the czars and then under the Soviet commissars, never had much democracy, that they kind of have a taste for this sort of leadership?SESTANOVICH: You know, one of my favorite Russian political analysts wrote a couple of days ago that the Putin regime is openly czarist. And he meant by that it, you know, invokes some real popularity and historical resonances.You know, I think this is greatly exaggerated, as something that the people want, because Putin could change it. If he wanted to make it more democratic, it would be simply up to him. It's not just a matter of social trends.But if you look at polls, press freedom and that sort of thing, they get now about 1 percent on the popular concern meter.HUME: Because people don't care about that stuff?SESTANOVICH: Yes, they care about what we would call pocketbook issues.HUME: Sort of like us. I mean, one gets the impression that people in this country enjoy press freedom, and they'd probably speak up for it, but it's not probably uppermost on their minds.SESTANOVICH: No, they care about it.HUME: Let me ask you about the relationship between Putin and Bush. Despite the grumbling, and despite the acid comments in the ""60 Minutes"" interview and before that about the U.S. election being not so terribly democratic in his eyes and so on, the president was clearly the guest of honor in the way he was treated in the observances at Moscow.SESTANOVICH: Right.HUME: What about this relationship? Is this a good personal relationship that is more important or less important than the political disagreements?SESTANOVICH: The president's calculation is obviously that, if they have a good relationship, he will have more leverage, influence, over Putin. What I think is becoming a little clearer is that the signals from all of this ""bon ami"" confuse people. I had a Polish journalist ask me, ""How can we really believe that the president has been seriously conveying this message about democracy to Putin when they seem to be such good buddies?"" Somehow, the public relationship has to capture a little bit of that message.HUME: For what purpose?SESTANOVICH: In order to convince the Russians and Putin personally that the president means it. Otherwise...HUME: So you think the message he may take away from the fact that Mr. Bush is so personally friendly to him, despite what Bush says, despite the other visits, despite the speech over the weekend in Lithuania -- it was Lithuania, correct?SESTANOVICH: Latvia.HUME: Latvia, excuse me. That's right. That that's all that matters, is that he didn't mean it?SESTANOVICH: The big guys always deal with each other this way. You know, we've got this great personal relationship which enables us to solve problems. The question is, when you've got a tough issue that you think is really, really serious, how do you convince the other president to -- that you mean it when you're still having these social dinners and having a great time?HUME: But the people in the Baltics probably heard the president and took him at his word?SESTANOVICH: They did.HUME: And the people in Georgia doubtless will.SESTANOVICH: They did.HUME: So the people who may be getting the mixed message here are the people in Russia.SESTANOVICH: And Putin himself, maybe.HUME: And let me just ask one final question. Do you think that Putin's -- just a few seconds left -- statements about the good old days have any geopolitical consequence?SESTANOVICH: They are a warning to Russia's neighbors. They put them on guard about what the purpose of Russian policy is. And I think that's entirely understandable. If you're thinking that the Soviet Union's collapse is a great catastrophe, watch out.HUME: Steven Sestanovich, great stuff. Thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2005 Fox News Network, L.L.C.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN MCCAIN, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm confident that I will attract the core establishment and the social conservatives, and I think I will win these races because I will have support throughout the political base of the Republican Party.SEN. JOHN KERRY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: Martin Luther King said that the time is always right to do what is right. And I'm here in South Carolina because this is the right time to share with you, to make sure that we know that I have the confidence and that Barack Obama can be, will be, and should be the next president of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ""SPECIAL REPORT"" GUEST HOST: OK, There you see Senator John McCain talking about his campaign, and Senator John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, endorsing Barack Obama today.We will talk about both races, this a little more than a couple of hours before the Republican presidential debate here on FOX. Some analytical observations from Fred Barnes, Executive Editor of ""The Weekly Standard,"" Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, and Mort Kondracke, Executive Editor of ""Roll Call,"" Fox News contributors all.Fred, let's start with the Republicans. John McCain seems to be gaining a little steam in Michigan. There are some polls out that show him pulling ahead of Romney. Talk about Michigan, because that is the next stop for Republicans.FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": It is the next stop. I am sorry you mentioned polls.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: We don't like polls anymore!BAIER: Let's not talk polls anymore, all right. BARNES: The truth is that McCain should win this state. He beat Bush there in 2000.One of the most important things is this: it's an open primary and it's easy to vote in either party. You just go in and ask for the Democratic ballot or the Republican ballot. You don't have to formally join a party, or anything.It is very easy for Democrats, who probably won't be interested in their primary because it is just a beauty contest. Hillary's on the ballot, but Obama is not, and I don't believe John Edwards is either. So there's really no incentive to vote in it. So a lot of Democrats and Independents, I think, will vote in the Republican primary, and they are more likely than not, I think, to vote for John McCain.And Romney says it's his home state, and it is. He hasn't lived there for over 40 years. That's long time. He moved to Massachusetts.And so, I think, basically, the political landscape there favors McCain.LIASSON: I think it is a must-win state for both of these guys. Romney certainly has the money to continue no matter what happens in Michigan, but I think there will be a lot of questions raised about his candidacy if he loses three out of the first big ones.I think for McCain, he has to show he can win somewhere outside of New Hampshire. This happened to him before. He won New Hampshire last time. He did win Michigan, but then he foundered in South Carolina.So I think it is really important. You can tell how important it is just because Romney is pulling back resources, even though he has plenty of them, from the other states. He's not advertising right now. He's off the air in South Carolina and, I think, in Florida to really concentrate on Michigan.BAIER: Let's look real quick at the FOX News Opinion Dynamics poll in South Carolina. The top contenders, McCain: 25 percent, Huckabee: 18, and Romney right there at 17. You see Thompson, who is really trying to make a stand in South Carolina, at the bottom there.Mara, are those numbers surprising to you?LIASSON: Yes, they are, because McCain seems to have gotten a real bounce out of New Hampshire. McCain was not there not very long ago in South Carolina. Huckabee was way up because of his win in Iowa.But I think the interesting thing about this race is, and everybody is waiting to see if this happens, will this be a race between Huckabee and McCain?First we have to get through Michigan to see what happens with Romney, but if it does, it will be fascinating--one person that the Republican establishment considers a heretic, and the other one that they consider a inaccessible maverick might be battling it out.BAIER: I want to turn to the Democrats. Do you have something quickly?MORT KONDRACKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ROLL CALL: I would expect tonight's debate to be a pounce on McCain time, because both Huckabee and Mitt Romney have got to score points against McCain, who seems to be the front runner both in Michigan and South Carolina.One fascinating thing about our poll is that when you ask who is the true conservative, Romney doesn't score. For all this bending himself out of shape, he is still not regarded as a true conservative.LIASSON: The operative word there is ""true.""BAIER: let's talk Democrats. Fred, John Kerry endorses Barack Obama. Does it make a difference?BARNES: I don't think it really does. I guess if you are a Democrat, you would rather have it than not, but endorsements don't matter very much.The expectation was if Obama had won New Hampshire, there would have been three or four other Democratic senators that have endorsed him, and they still might.Actually, I would say the endorsement by the culinary workers in Nevada is more important than the endorsement by John Kerry. Even union endorsements aren't all that important, but still that is one that is more important than most.And Nevada is a battleground, and that's going to help Obama there.BAIER: Bill Richardson drops out today. How does that factor in?LIASSON: He didn't factor before and he doesn't factor now.I think the Democratic race, despite the rollercoaster that we have all been on and the way that the polls have led us by the nose, or we have allowed them to, this is a race between two well-matched opponents. The Democrats like them both. They both have a lot of money. They're popular. This will be a battle of the titans.I think it is very well matched. Both of them are very strong in the next two states of South Carolina and Nevada.KONDRACKE: I think the importance of these endorsements that they occurred in spite of Obama's loss in New Hampshire. In other words, he did not lose anybody that he was going to get, and they came the next day, and they said we still love you, Obama. And I think that that helps them considerably.BAIER: And both campaigns say they have money flowing in now.All right, that's it. Next up with the panel, we'll look at what the troop surge has accomplished after one year in Iraq and what remains to be done there. Stay with us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERY GATES, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The number of IED attacks per week has declined by half. Anbar Province, once considered a stronghold of Al Qaeda, has been reclaimed for the Iraqi people. High- profile attacks, car bombs, and suicide attacks are down 60 percent since March. And civilian deaths are down 75 percent from a year ago, although still far too high.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: That was Defense Secretary Robert Gates today talking about the troop surge in Iraq. Obviously, the political situation there has not moved forward, and that is a point Democrats continue to make.House speaker Nancy Pelosi put out a statement about the surge one year later, saying ""Despite the bravery of our men and women in uniform, the primary purpose of the president's surge policy has not been achieved. The Iraqi government is nowhere near political reconciliation that would contribute to regional stability.""We're back with our panel. Mort, what do you think about the back and forth and about the surge overall?KONDRACKE: Well, clearly the surge is accomplishing its military mission. It has suppressed the violence. Casualties are down. It's working. Al Qaeda in Iraq is being defeated.And you would think that the Democratic Party, its presidential candidates and its congressional leaders, would at least say yes, it's worked. It is working. Sorry, we were wrong. We wanted to de-fund it, but, by gosh, it's working.Now, it hasn't worked as well as it should, but they can't do it because the base will rise up against them. And I think John McCain was absolutely right today when he said that if it had been up to the Democrats, Al Qaeda would now be victorious in Iraq, and they would be saying to the world we defeated the United States. BAIER: He and Joe Lieberman--KONDRACKE: He and Joe Lieberman wrote a piece--there of a warning in that piece that the United States should not pull down troops too low. We're going to pull out the surge brigade, but to go back down to a too-low figure for political reasons or for other reasons would not be good unless the Iraqi military can stand up in place.Bush may as well play this game out and try to win if he possibly can during his term. BAIER: Mara, there aren't a lot of people out there who say that the violence is not down.LIASSON: That even the Democrats will agree on. The candidates will say that, but they say the political piece of this--the idea that the surge was to make a space for the reconciliation to occur, and yes, the military side has worked but the political side hasn't. That's their argument.I think what is interesting in the Democratic primary, at least, is that Iraq has really receded as an issue. You just don't hear people talking about it. It has become this weird popularity contest between Obama and Hillary, but it's not about Iraq, at least it isn't right now.And on the Republican side, I think John McCain is clearly getting a boost because he was right all along.BARNES: He was right. If you watch the exit polls, the war in Iraq is more popular with Republicans than President Bush is by a substantial margin.But the surge's success has destroyed many myths that Democrats still seem to believe. One was that the war was lost--obviously it's not. Another one was that we can't stop this sectarian violence. It has been stopped. We'll lose more American troops, casualties will go way up. They haven't. They're way down once all the troops got there.The capital city, Baghdad, has been virtually secured. Mort said Al Qaeda hasn't been fully defeated, but it's certainly on the run. And there really has been a lot of reconciliation. The Sunnis from Anbar have thrown in with the U.S. and the government.You do have a feckless prime minister, but there has been remarkable political reconciliation at the provincial level.BAIER: Fred, here is what the critics say, is that we are giving weapons and money to the Sunnis, and when we leave it will go, essentially, into the toilet.LIASSON: Used in the civil war, yes.BARNES: Look, the Sunni insurgency is over. Are the Sunnis going to start it up again? No, they aren't. Are the Shia, they're the majority, are they going to kill all these Sunnis now? It's just illogical. It's not going to happen.Content and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2008 Voxant, Inc.

3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2011/09/08/politics-federal-raid-gibson/	 Politics of Federal Raid on Gibson 	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" September 7, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRUCE MITCHELL, GIBSON GUITARS ATTORNEY: We are being singled out, very much so. Every music instrument company in the United States uses rosewood fingerboards, period. And they are in the same state, they're buying from the same suppliers, they're using the same shippers.ERIC HOLDER, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: The actions that we take in all matters, are based on the facts, the law, and the enforcement responsibilities that we have. We have no politics involved. That's not how we make decisions in this department.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Talking about Gibson Guitars, iconic guitars, a piece of Americana. Federal agents seized $1 million worth of exotic woods from -- wood from India, claiming that wood is illegal to import, in a couple of raids.This has caused a big stir politically. And now the CEO of Gibson Guitars Henry Juszkiewicz -- say that fast -- is going to be invited to the House speaker's box for the big speech tomorrow night. And he is a guest of Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn. This has caused a stir.We're back with the panel. Mary Katharine, start with the pronunciation of that name and then move on to the importance of this story.MARY KATHARINE HAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Henry Juszkiewicz. It's an American company, it's an American iconic, and it's a company that has created jobs over the past couple of years, over 500 manufacturing jobs in musical instruments in Tennessee. So I think it's sort of a losing PR battle to get into this to some extent. And I've talked to people on the Hill. He is creating quite a stir. The story is creating quite a stir, because on the Hill it's always fun to have a brush with coolness. And this is a musical instrument, it's kind of cool, rock 'n' roll.And it's a violation of the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to prevent any plant material from coming in that was illegally in any way along the line harvested, from harvest all the way here. But it's unclear to many how this is regulated, how the declarations are supposed to work. And they get this raid that takes much of their raw materials from them for what it looks like amounts to like a good faith paperwork mistake. And I just think that the priorities here look very mixed up.BAIER: Chuck, you hear the attorney general saying the decision was not a political one yet you hear the company saying that their competitors are using the exact same kind of wood. They haven't been raided. And they haven't been charged. They haven't gone after those other competitors. And there is an element of politics here. The CEO of Gibson Guitars is a Republican who has donated to Republican campaigns. And the others are Democrats.CHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL WRITER, WASHINGTON POST: Well, that is surely what I would say if I were in the crosshairs of this investigation. But, let's face it, sometimes when the feds do this, they do it based on a source they have, a snitch, somewhere within whatever place seems opportune.I think Mary Katharine is to the point here, ya know this narrative does not help the president in terms of this whole job creation debate. Here it looks like a company that was going along, creating jobs, is getting bugged by the federal government, bothered by the federal government because of a technical violation of a law no one has ever heard of. And I think that question about the prosecutorial resources of the Justice Department and the federal government more generally and the priorities it's setting -- I mean imported rosewood is a big problem facing this country right now? That is the issue.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, first, full disclosure, my first electric guitar was a Gibson, although the company is exonerated from the music that actually emerged from my guitar, which was quite awful, actually.(LAUGHTER)KRAUTHAMMER: Look, this strikes every wrong note. It's as uncool as having a raid on Apple. And it doesn't appear as if there was some secret source here. As we heard in the earlier report from John Roberts, the guitar sellers tell you that all the companies use the same stuff from the same place. So, you have obvious case of selective persecution or at least investigation if you like with no obvious reason why. And the differences that we heard in the report were A, I mean, that you could attribute this to, are the fact that it's nonunion, whereas a lot of the other competitors are union. And second, that the CEO is a Republican who supports Republicans openly and a lot of the others are Democrats. So at least that is out there. There is no evidence of a bias here, but when you hear the attorney general tell you that we only respond to the law and the interpretation of the law and justice, I'm a little bit skeptical here. I mean, I'll believe a lot of stuff but I'm not sure I'll believe all of that.BAIER: To Chuck's point, Mary Katharine, about the image on the jobs front ahead of this speech tomorrow, there are some who are looking at this and comparing it to the National Labor Relations Board action, with South Carolina and Boeing, and saying this doesn't paint a good picture for the administration.HAM: No, it doesn't at all. And I would add that it goes beyond guitars and Gibson. I was reading a trade mag, Furniture Today, as I'm wont to do, it's about the furniture industry. And they import a lot of this hard wood and fine wood to finish furniture, in North Carolina, it's a big industry. And they are fretting very openly about how is the government going to regulate this? Are they going to come and raid us? So it goes beyond creating jobs just at this one place, and scares the rest of the industry, which is the point that many Republicans have been trying to make on the Hill.KRAUTHAMMER: And the law itself is ambiguous and easily abused because it defines illegality in America on the basis of what's illegal in the other country. So if you do ""x"" in country ""a"" it could be illegal -- if you do the same ""x"" in country ""b"" it could not. And that's why a selective raid raises a lot of questions.BAIER: We have invited Henry Juszkiewicz on to the program tomorrow. We'll see if he appears. That is it for the panel. But stay tuned for political messages delivered with a real punch. Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2011 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAXINE WATERS, D - CALI.: This is a tough day. You can't be intimidated. You can't be fr ightened. As far as I'm concerned, the Tea Party can go straight to hell. And I intend to help them get there.MICHELE BACHMANN, R - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When you take the Tea Party movement and you add together the fiscal conservatives and you add together the national security conservati ves and the social social conservatives, I am just here to tell you, we are an absolute powerhouse that can't be beat.JON HUNTSMAN, R - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When you find yourself at an extreme end of the Republican Party, you make yourself unelectable.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Targeting the Tea Party. It seems popular in some quarters. We're back with the panel. Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Juan, lashing out at the Tea Party. What about that statement?JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: Well the statement's offensive. I mean, that is just, ya know, I think excessive rhetoric and not very -- I don't think it's the kind of rhetoric that we want in the country and it should be condemned by people on the left.BAIER: Yeah, but ya know, after Governor Perry said what he said about treating Bernanke --WILLIAMS: And that was condemned. Treason -- treason and all that.BAIER: Pretty ugly, that got a lot of coverage.WILLIAMS: Yeah. And this is getting coverage. But what I'm saying is, if you look at the roots of this, much of it has to do with the liberal coalition in the Congress, feeling that they were abandoned, totally left out in the debt ceiling negotiations that we just went through. And people like Maxine Waters and a lot of the members of the Black Caucus on that left side of the Democratic caucus in the Congress felt that they were absolutely ignored. I mean she's made it --BAIER: Outmaneuvered.WILLIAMS: Yeah. Not only outmaneuvered, ignored, that the president was not responding to them. He was responding to those 87 freshmen Tea Party Republicans, and that they were dominating the conversation. And not only that, Maxine Waters feels the president was out in the Midwest, talking to everybody, never stopped in an urban environment, never talked to any blacks. I think for Maxine Waters at this moment, she feels like the politics of the day, despite the fact that there is an African- American Democratic president, have gone by her. And she -- that is what you are seeing there.BAIER: Charles, Tea Party folks say that they've struck a nerve, and people are reacting to it, not only on the Democratic side but within the Republican Party.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: That's true, and the Waters statement is another example of the Democrats upholding the standards of civil discourse that they have insisted on since Tucson because she actually only said she wanted them to go to hell. She didn't say they are terrorists, which is the mean that others have used, including, reportedly, Vice President of the United States.Look, they are very upset because they lost the debate; they weren't even in the debate on the debt ceiling. But I do think that it works for liberals to talk to liberals in that kind of dismissive and sort of angry tone about Tea Party, it's sort of accepted on the Upper West Side. But it doesn't work in the general election. And I think that's why you get less of that out of the White House. Tea Party involves a lot of independents, a lot of disaffected Democrats. And when you insult it or really get vile about it, you are alienating people you are gonna need if you want to win. I don't expect to see Obama do this in the campaign.BAIER: Steve?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I do expect to see the Democrats do quite a bit of this in the campaign because they don't have a positive argument to make on behalf of the policies that the White House and fellow Democrats have made. But if this were effective, we wouldn't have a Republican majority in the House. I mean this is exactly what Democrats did all throughout the summer and throughout the fall of 2010 and Republicans won in record numbers. Simply beating up the Tea Party is not a good electoral strategy for Democrats.KRAUTHAMMER: But that's why I think it's not gonna happen at a presidential level, because it won't work.BAIER: Congressman Paul Ryan, Steve, announcing today that he will not seek the presidential nomination, the party's nomination for president, saying that he is hopeful that party nominates a candidate committed to a pro-growth agenda of reform and restores promise and prosperity to our exceptional nation. Surprised?HAYES: I'm not terribly surprised. I mean the real question with whether Paul Ryan was going to run is did he actually want to be president? And there were very few indications that he wanted to be president. And having said that, by all accounts, and I talked to a total of more than ten people who had had conversations with him about this. He was very strongly considering a run for president, he consulted with Republican strategists, he talked to high-dollar Republican fundraisers, he had meaningful talks with his own family, apparently got the blessing of his wife Janna for a run. Spent some time this week in Colorado talking to Bill Bennett, who's a mentor, about a run. So he was clearly struggling with this decision starting back in late May all the way through the summer and has finally decided not to go. He is a conviction politician and this wasn't what his conviction told him.BAIER: Quickly Juan, Sarah Palin, Governor Chris Christie, the last two that are -- it appears on the fence. Governor Christie said he'd have to commit suicide to say he's not running.WILLIAMS: Yeah, I don't see Governor Christie coming in Bret, but I do think that Sarah Palin is displaying all the behavior of somebody who wants to get in the race.KRAUTHAMMER: I would agree. Palin in, Christie out.BAIER: That's if it for panel. But stay tuned -- well, just stay tuned.Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/03/20/politics-romneys-puerto-rico-win/	 Politics of Romney's Puerto Rico win 	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" March 19, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MITT ROMNEY, R - REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our choice will be not one of just party and personality. This election is going to be about principle. Our economic freedom will be on the ballot. And I intend to offer the American people a choice.RICK SANTORUM, R - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have been outspent here badly again. And we can come back and show we have this core base of the Republican Party here in the state of Illinois, that they are rejecting mitt Romney in spite of all the advantages that he has in this race. I think that will send a signal that this race is heading in our direction.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: After a win in Puerto Rico all of the delegates on the table going to Mitt Romney, the next battle Illinois tomorrow, and it's a big one. Here is the real clear politics average of polls. It shows Romney up 39.5 percent to 31 percent. Two new polls ARG and PPP have it at double digits, 14 percent, 15 percent lead. But this is the average of polls as we look towards Illinois. We're back with the panel. Steve, your thoughts?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, I think, you know, it's easy to say in hindsight but clearly the time that Rick Santorum spent in Puerto Rico didn't do him any good and would have been time that he might have been able to use more effectively had he spent more time in the outstate areas of Illinois making sure that he gets the delegates that he is expected to get there.I think looking forward, you know, their campaign is trying to argue this is just about Illinois at this point. This is about Wisconsin. It's about Louisiana, it's about down the road and this is a long fight. And that's the argument I think that is most effective for them to make at this point because Mitt Romney is expected to do well in Illinois tomorrow.BAIER: Listen to the two candidates talk about Puerto Rico and the results.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROMNEY: Conservative principles are applying in Puerto Rico. And those people who don't think that Latinos will vote for a Republican need to take a look in Puerto Rico.SANTORUM: We stood up for the truth in Puerto Rico. Mitt Romney pandered. He went down there and while he says that he is for English being the language of America, he goes down to Puerto Rico and says that Puerto Ricans -- 15 percent of them speak English can enter the union and not have to speak English. I mean it's just -- the outrageousness of what this man will do for 20 delegates. Maybe now we know his price.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: We didn't cue the band there, but you get the point. Rick Santorum, Juan, saying he stood by his principles but he came out of Puerto Rico with eight percent of that vote and zero delegates.JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: You know, and even people who had endorsed him and turned away when he started this business about you must speak English in order for Puerto Rico to become a state. There is nothing like that in the constitution, no such requirement. Clearly, there those in the Republican base who are calling for English to be the official language of states in the nation alike, but that's never been the requirement. And you are going to suddenly change it in terms of Puerto Rico. And when people are born in Puerto Rico right now they're American citizens. So, I think that doesn't work.The other part that was more interesting to me was to hear Romney say that Puerto Rico was evidence that he can win the Latino vote. Well, there is no such evidence in recent polls. And the fact is that he seems to be doubling down in terms of his opposition, he is the hardest of all the candidates when it comes to immigration reform.BAIER: Well, that poll had him at 87 percent.WILLIAMS: That's Puerto Rico. That's why. That was a GOP primary in Puerto Rico against Rick Santorum.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think what Santorum did in Puerto Rico is emblematic of what he has done in the campaign. He is a man of principle and he speaks them everywhere even though there is no reason he had to. It's a theoretical issue about statehood. Puerto Rico has rejected statehood every single time it's been on the ballot. So it's not going to happen and he didn't have to answer a hypothetical that, in fact, angered the local population and electorate. But that's what he does. He answers questions on principle that a good candidate would dodge or simply punt.And, you asked incidentally if this was the nastiest campaign ever. I would say Octavius and Mark Anthony was probably the worst. In those you lose you die. Here you lose you go to K Street and become a lobbyist.But it is nasty. And you saw it in that tone. What will he do to get 20 delegates? He'll betray his principles? Is it a betrayal of principles to say if Puerto Rico won statehood and will admit it that not everybody has to learn English overnight? I'm not sure. But you've got the slow and steady Romney accumulating the delegates, Santorum nipping at his heals. But Illinois is going to be a big deal.BAIER: And he's outspending Santorum really five to one, six to one in Illinois on the ground with these ads and the super PAC.One more point. One of the pastors in Illinois introducing Rick Santorum for a speech there in front of a congregation, and a controversial statement where Santorum responded to it today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PASTOR DENNIS TERRY, GREENWELL SPRINGS BAPTIST CHURCH: If you don't love America and you don't like the way we do things, I have got one thing to say -- get out!(APPLAUSE)TERRY: We don't worship Buddha. We don't worship Mohammed. We don't worship Allah. We worship God. We worship God's son Jesus Christ.SANTORUM: Do I agree with his statement that America should do that? No. He was speaking for himself. He is obviously allowed to believe what he wants to believe. But obviously I believe in freedom of religion and all religions are welcome and should be.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: That was in Louisiana and not Illinois. Steve?HAYES: I think you shouldn't have to answer for everything that somebody who supports you says. But if you speak after somebody who has made a statement like that, I think it's incumbent upon you to differentiate yourself from your views and his views as expressed in that clip.BAIER: Juan?WILLIAMS: Well, you were saying earlier he is a man of principle. If he was a man of principle that was the moment to stand up and say I am not opposed to having Jews and Muslims who want to be Americans and who love America be part of our country.BAIER: That is it for the panel, but stay tuned for an unlikely musical collaboration.

6	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/03/21/politics-behind-ryan-plan-lower-deficit/	 Politics behind Ryan plan to lower deficit 	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" March 20, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN, R - WI HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We propose to sav e and strengthen Medicare by taking power away from government bureaucrats.REP. XAVIER BECERRA, D - CA.: It ends the Medicare guarantee for seniors. It cuts obviously benefits to seniors who need health care.RYAN: We propose to collapse the six different tax brackets into two rates, a 10 percent bracket and a 25 percent bracket for individuals.JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Hey, I'm going to give you a tax break and, hey, I'm going to eliminate the AMT, and then have no details on how you would pay for them.REP. JOHN BOEHNER, R - OHIO HOUSE SPEAKER: Our budget will protect seniors and really begin to deal with these tremendous deficits that have been driven up by this administration.CARNEY: It is not a plan that this president could support.(END VIDEOTAPE)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: The reaction today to House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan laying out a sweeping reform. The Republican budget includes, as you heard there, bringing down the tax brackets from six to two, 10 and 25 percent, corporate tax rate at 25 percent and federal spending cuts of $5.3 trillion over the next 10 years.What about this, the way forward politically and in this policy? Let's bring in our special expanded panel from Washington. Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, and Brit Hume, Fox News senior political analyst.Mara, start with you, your thought of this budget and what it means politically?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, I think what it means politically is Republicans now have something to rally around. It's simple in terms of tax reform, two rates. Cuts spending a lot, which is something that Republicans want.The big piece that's missing really is they say they want to get rid of tax expenditures that's how they're going to do this tax reform, they're going to broaden the base while they're lowering rates, but they don't say what tax expenditures they're going to cut. So I think that's a question that still remains to be answered. They haven't said yet exactly what income levels will go into the tax bracket. But I do think it's clear. It does say that it's going to solve the problem and it gives Republicans something to run on, and that's important.BAIER: Bill?BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes. I think it is what the Republican nominee's going to run on and I suspect it's what the Republican president, if there is one in January of 2013, will govern on. So I think in some very important way this is now Paul Ryan's party, at least when it comes to budgetary matters, fiscal matters, debt, deficit and Medicare reform, which is an awful lot of things. And incidentally, he also addresses defense. As you know they're this sequester which is hanging over everyone which would impose brutal cuts on the defense budget next year. And he didn't have to do this as budget chairman, but he also shows a way to get out of the sequester, take the cuts out of mandatory, domestic spending programs, so you get to the same deficit reduction number, this is in next year, without destroying defense, which is something that is awfully important to a lot of conservatives, including me.So I think what Paul Ryan has done is really a task of intellectual and political leadership, and it will now be up to him and his colleagues and above all to the Republican presidential candidate to make the case that this is a better way forward than President Obama's.BAIER: To that point, Brit, two reactions, one from Mitt Romney about this budget plan, saying, quote, today, ""The House Republican budget rejects the out-of-control spending and higher taxes proposed by President Obama in his budget last month, by imposing prescriptions that will strengthen Medicare for generations to come. It also highlights President Obama's failed leadership on entitlement reform."" Newt Gingrich saying, ""The House GOP budget is a courageous plan that correctly understands the key to returning to a balanced budget is robust economic growth, spending control, and bold entitlement reform,"" a much different answer from Newt Gingrich, for example, from a year ago.BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: That's true, Bret. And let's underscore what is really critical about what Paul Ryan is proposing here. The big driver of deficit spending, the big out of control program is Medicare. He proposes to change Medicare from a program of an open-ended program of basically unlimited benefits where the only way you can press the cost is by taking out of the hides of medical providers, which really doesn't work, it makes medical care less available, and he imposes limits on it.It is going to be very hard to pass that. It won't pass this year, certainly won't pass this year. It will never pass with Democrats in control of the Senate and the White House. Paul Ryan clearly believes that at some point a day of reckoning is coming. Medicare will collapse of its own weight if something isn't done to change it. He is betting that it's time to put himself and his party on the side of avoiding what he calls the most predictable fiscal crisis the country's ever faced.That is the key here. It's going to take guts for these House Republicans to go along with it. It looks like the presidential candidates are going to support it. That's an encouraging sign for what Ryan is trying to do. But make no mistake about it, the big item here, the tough one is Medicare because that's the big driver.BAIER: We should point out there was no statement from Rick Santorum. Ron Paul said that the budget doesn't really cut anything, any spending.Charles, the political danger here is that Democrats, obviously, and they already started today, will pounce on this and try to turn the discussion. How successful can they have doing that -- will they have, doing that in this environment?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, they already had a campaign on last year's Ryan budget, the ""Medi-scare"" campaign, which was in part, dishonest. They said it abolishes Medicare, in fact it just changed it, amended it, and changed it in different ways.They're gonna have a harder case today because the new Ryan approach makes one major tweak. He got Ron Wyden, the Democratic senator of Oregon, to join him in a joint proposal where you do change Medicare from a guaranteed program of provider payments, meaning fee-for-service, into one where you guarantee the premium, the cost of the insurance.However, what he added now in this budget is a provision that if you want to choose the old traditional Medicare, you can do that. So now any Democrat who charges that it abolishes current Medicare is not speaking the truth. They will try that. They will say it. They said it today already. But it simply isn't so. It's one of the options that is offered. And that was a very important change.And remember, the House Republicans approved the budget last year without a provision of that sort. So now I think they have some kind of political protection. And it will make the argument -- the dishonest argument of the Democrats of abolishing Medicare a lot more it difficult.BAIER: Mara, you look at this chart and Paul Ryan used this today, citing the OMB and CBO numbers and he says it's the two paths that go forward. And basically this budget calls for federal spending reductions over the next 10 years of $5.3 trillion, and he points out that the current path continues to go up as a percentage of GDP to debt.LIASSON: Look, what he is doing is trying to get the discussion, the election-year debate, back onto the deficit. It's kind of remarkable. We went through this whole year of one commission after another laying out paths to bringing the deficit under control, how you could do tax reform, how you could raise revenues with tax reform, how you could cut spending, how you could do this, that, and the other thing. And they all laid out more or less the same plan with slightly different tweaks.And then it dropped, it just disappeared into a black hole, and you haven't heard these candidates talking much about it. But I do think now that Ryan has come out with this, I think this will get more talk from the Republican candidates.BAIER: Bill, the Senate has not passed a budget in quite some time.KRISTOL: Right.BAIER: I think it's 1,060 days. There is probably very little hope that this budget has a chance anywhere near the Senate.KRISTOL: No. But Republicans really need to make the case that it should be passed. And Mara's right that they need to get back to the urgency of the deficit and the debt. The debt has gone up from slightly under $10 trillion when Barack Obama became president to slightly over $15 trillion. It's gone up 56 percent. It is totally unsustainable. And under Barack Obama - under President Obama's budget, the debt continues to go up at almost that rate.And the Republicans reduce the rate of growth of the debt. It turns over in a couple of years, so to speak, as a percentage of GDP, and starts to go down. I think the Republicans and presidential candidates are busy squabbling with each other and worrying about things and they're not making the case for the urgency of the kinds of Medicare reforms and other reforms that the Ryan budget presents.HUME: Let's not forget Bret, that this issue of spending and out of control debt is what drove the 2010 election. So I think that sentiment that drove that is still out there to be tapped.BAIER: Panel, thank you very much for the Brady Bunch version.

7	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/03/09/inside-politics-rising-gas-prices/	 Inside the politics of rising gas prices 	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" March 8, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVEN CHU, ENERGY SECRETARY: According to the Obama administration, the p roduction of petroleum liquids in the United States have increased now -- I believe it's the highest it's been in over eight years.REP. STEVE SCALISE, R - LOUISIANA: We've seen just from 2010 to 2011 an 11 percent reduction in oil production on federal lands. In the Gulf of Mexico, exclusive ly, we have seen 17 percent reduction in oil production. Where the increase has come is on private lands.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, a battle over energy up on Capitol Hill. On the Senate side Senate Republicans proposed an amendment to take the decision of the Keystone XL pipeline away from the president, give it to a federal agency and approve that pipeline. The president made personal calls to Democrats, lawmakers, to lobby against this. These are the Democrats who voted against this amendment, it did end up failing, not -- didn't get the 60 votes needed to pass. And the House speaker weighed in on that lobbying effort.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JOHN BOEHNER, R - OHIO, HOUSE SPEAKER: I don't know how the president can say I'm for an all-of-the-above energy strategy and then lobby against the Keystone pipeline which is supported by almost 70 percent of the American people. His actions are not matching up with the rhetoric that he is using. And the fact is the president wanted to blame us for blocking the Keystone pipeline, and here it is, the president himself, personally calling senators asking them to vote against this amendment in the Senate today.JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president obviously has communications with members of Congress with some regularity.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Wasn't too much more from the White House on the efforts, the phone calls. We're back with the panel. What about this issue overall, Steve? How is this playing out?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, it's a huge issue both in terms of the substance of it, in terms of what we're seeing with gas prices but also in terms of the politics of it. If you just think of what we've seen over the last couple of days on the presidential campaign trail, you've got Newt Gingrich releasing a 30-minute video on this. You've got his podium with a gas pump on it. He was visiting a gas station. Rick Santorum shortly before we came on air sent out a tweet about it, he mentions gas prices in his speeches. Mitt Romney just gave a speech in front of an oil rig. This is something Republicans see it as a great vulnerability for the White House, and I think they should. The fact that the President of the United States was making calls to lobby Democratic senators came because he was worried that this could actually pass and he would look weak, and it would put him in a bit of a pickle. The fact that he was making those calls, though, I think up-ends the White House's argument that they are not politically responsible.BAIER: Jeff?JEFF ZELENY, NEW YORK TIMES: I think that if you talk to the president's advisors, one of the top concerns, at least domestically, is gas prices. So optically it doesn't look that great for the White House right now that he is sort of trying to step in front of this. The bigger problem for this a lot of the highest gas prices are coming in swing states where Democrats need to win, where his re-election is going to be on the line, like Ohio and Pennsylvania. So this is a big worry for the White House. And it should be.BAIER: Well you have also some Democrats on that list that we put up earlier for re-election in swing states, Claire McCaskill voting against this effort.MARY KATHARINE HAM, THE DAILY CALLER: The issue of why the gas prices are high is complex. The issue of whether it's a huge political issue is simple. And he will take flak for it. And people who are charge will take flak for it. And when people look at the situation and they see the energy secretary saying it is not our goal to get gas prices down, he said some things in 2008 that sort of reinforced that for people and they see the energy secretary doling out all these huge loans for alternative energy that end up very obviously failing, and then they see this sort of no-brainer in Keystone and the president actively lobbying against it, I think it makes a difference for people.BAIER: It is important to note that oil prices are complex. It's a world commodity. There are a lot of different factors, it's not just supply, it's not just demand. There is world supply issues and world demand issues. But on the simple term, who is winning this back and forth politically?HAYES: I think politically there is no question that Republicans are winning it. In part they are making -- everything you just said there is true about the way that oil is priced. However, it doesn't mean that the United States and the U.S. government in particular, can't do anything to affect those prices. If you look what President Bush did back in July 2008 when he lifted the moratorium in the east and west outer continental shelf you saw gas prices come down 12 percent over 45 days. That's not insignificant.What happens is you've got betting on the future supply of oil. People make those bets based on what signals they are getting from the administration. When an administration signals that it's not interested in increasing supply on something that is as simple as this that does affect prices.BAIER: Speculators factor in, oil companies and their big picture factor in, but the whole supply and demand question is really interesting. Secretary Chu today, Jeff, up on Capitol Hill saying, yes, when you release the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the prices did go down, and then conceding that supply does matter. The President has talked about demand and lowering demand.ZELENY: Right. And he mentioned in his White House press conference earlier this week that the administration is looking at some other options. So my guess is that they will do something in the months forward. But the simple reason he is losing the argument is because he is the incumbent. It is his problem. He made the exact argument against President Bush against Republicans when he was running for president, and now it's coming back at him. It's as simple as that.BAIER: That is it for the panel. But stay tuned, a head-to-head political match-up.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

"And now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:Playing Politics?Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson is being accused of playing politics with the bin Laden killing.Politico reports Nelson, who is running for re-election next year, tied the U.S. operation in Pakistan to his stance against a bill that he says would make it more difficult to cast early ballots. After referencing 9/11 Nelson said -- quote -- ""We find ourselves gathered in our capital city of this state again here to protect our democracy... to keep the right to vote.""The Republican Senate president who is challenging Nelson for U.S. Senate says Nelson stooped to a new low for -- quote -- ""Comparing pending legislation to a terrorist organization that has killed thousands of people.""Close ShaveA middle school teacher from Washington state was relieved to learn of bin Laden's death not just for the obvious reasons, but because he vowed after the 9/11 attacks that he would not shave his beard until bin Laden was caught or killed.Gary Weddle told his students every year the beard was a reminder of the attacks and it made him look a little like bin Laden. So he wasted no time Sunday. The beard was gone by the time President Obama addressed the nation.Puttering AroundAnd finally, prospective Republican presidential candidate and businessman Donald Trump has been trumped in the headlines by the UBL raid. But Trump is raising some eyebrows for comparing his opposition to legalizing same-sex marriage to his reluctance to use a new kind of putter.He told The New York Times Sunday -- quote -- ""It's like in golf... I don't want this to sound trivial, but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters because they can't sink three-footers anymore. And I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist."""
