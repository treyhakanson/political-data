This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 27, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Twelve days folks, 12 days, although the mainstream media would love to prematurely declare Hillary Clinton the winner, they can't because Donald Trump has sliced her lead in half according to a new Fox News poll. Only three points between the nominees now. Yesterday, Hillary Clinton celebrated her birthday with her pals in the press.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Here is some birthday cake. I hate my piece (ph) and I highly recommend it, especially if you are a chocolate lover because it is really, really good.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Must have worked because she sweetened them up before answering these hard hitting questions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How do you feel about your birthday and the campaign and where you are today? Our new poll in New Hampshire has you up by nine points.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: DO you think you're going to try to meet one-on-one with Donald Trump after the election is over and also sit down with Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell as part of the process to help the country heal?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you succeeded I getting the American people getting to know you? Do you feel like they know the real you?(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Trump on the other hand didn't get the same kind of treatment from the media yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is one of his last 13 mornings before the election and he is spending it not in a place where he can pick up electoral votes or a place where he is shaking hands with battle ground voters but here at his hotel.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oddly, Donald Trump will not spend this morning in a battleground state but here in the District of Columbia raising questions in some Republican circles is Trump more interested in self-promotion than victory.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With less than two weeks to go, Donald Trump taking time away from the voters to spend time with his business.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's got 13 days left and he's trailing in the polls. Is this a good use of his time?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not. If you were a sane presidential candidate, you wouldn't go anywhere near that hotel during the presidential campaign.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BOLLING: All right, KG, why don't we let Juan handle the softball questions for Hillary Clinton but on Donald Trump getting taken to task for opening his hotel in D.C., well, I got to think that would be a good thing you'd want a guy who is successful in business to take them in (ph) and show how successful he can be with the country.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Right. Well, because if you tie it in right, OK. I mean, it's something that he wanted to see. He is not abandoning his business in the meantime. However, yes, this is like neck and neck in terms of now it's tightening between the gap between the two of them.RealClearPolitics is moving Pennsylvania as a tossup so, yeah, you want to devote all your time you can to those states you can win. But, if you can tie in the message and say, I'm a man who has created jobs, you know, built businesses. This is what I want to do with the economy and this is an example of what jobs she created and move on from there, sure. But it doesn't matter, I mean, at this point, if he came up with the cure for cancer, the press is going to bash him it seems like.BOLLING: Mr. Juan, a couple of weeks left, 12 or 13 days left, depending when the sound bite came from. How do you feel on your birthday? You crushed it, you're up by nine. After you win the presidency, are you going to shake hands with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan? Wow!JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, you know what I think, you have an occasion there where it's her birthday and she's in the back of the plane. And so people are talking to her and they also are trying to develop relationships with someone they see as a potential president of the United States.But I will say this. I thought that she had some interesting answers like for example, when she was talking -- I think it's very important for her about the need to reach out to people who aren't going to vote for her, to people who are independents and especially to Republican congressional leaders if she hopes to get anything done. So I was interested that she was -- that's on her mind.That's what she is talking about and that's okay because the questions weren't hard ball questions. So if you want to say soft, fine, but I did think it's interesting to see if you give somebody a blank slate, what comes out of their mouth. And in this case, immediately she was talking about doing business with Republicans.BOLLING: You know, and Juan points out, if you give somebody a blank slate -- I'm not sure that they've given Donald Trump a blank slate yet. They certainly give her quite a few blank slates.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: It reminded me of -- remember when President Obama had that press conference and I can't remember the name of the guy but he stood and he said, Mr. President, what enchants you the most about the White House? It was like, okay, seriously now?BOLLING: Well, I think if you ask him what his favorite color was at some point.PERINO: Well, these are things America needs to know. I do think she was pretty smart on one thing. Always feed the press before you take questions from them.BOLLING: All right Greg, you pointed this out yesterday. Trump being a businessman might be an asset, not a detriment.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah, you know, it's not bad to have a job to fall back on but you know what? I didn't see those questions as softballs. In that context, those were blistering take no prisoners interrogation. We didn't show you what else they asked. They asked what it's like to be a Scorpio because you know, I think she's a Scorpio, right, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Yep.GUTFELD: And also how the grandkids are. They went really -- they did a deep dive into her grandkids. They found out that the grandkids -- this is breaking news -- are doing pretty good. And then they asked her what she thought of the new Bridgette Jones sequel and apparently she hadn't seen it and that upset a lot of people in the crew and they sulked for a while.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is that supposed to be pretty good? Is that supposed to be good?GUTFELD: It's supposed to be great actually. By the way, I mean, it's not like Trump never got a softball question. I seem to remember hours of softball questions.GUILFOYLE: Can you not start again?GUTFELD: No, I didn't say anything. I'm just saying, look, we can't be biopic about this. We put on our team sport blinders and we say, oh, she's getting easy questions. Trump gets easy questions, too. Let's be honest.WILLIAMS: And by the way, you know when you're talking earlier about Trump, I didn't get a chance to respond, but I will say this to you. It's not just Democrats who had thought why is he in D.C. at the second -- for the second time to open a hotel he opened in September. I think a lot of Republicans thought, well, why aren't you in Ohio. You are still doing well in Ohio. Go secure Ohio. Get out into the states where you can fight.BOLLING: Maybe his message is I'm not a typical politician. I'm not a typical presidential candidate. I'm different. I spent my life doing this and it works and maybe I like spending...WILLIAMS: I just tell you how people -- I'm just telling you a lot of people in politics took it as, you know, this is self-promotion. This guy - - he's not even putting his whole heart into it. He's asking us to vote for him but he's not even really putting himself on the line. He's still out there worried in fact that the campaign match (ph) is damaging his brand.BOLLING: You don't think there's -- you know, if you draw a line on an ledge (ph) or a plus or minus for a candidate that he's been a very successful business person, you wouldn't put that on the plus side, you put that in a negative side? I mean, it's one or the other.WILLIAMS: You know that old theory in politics, that sometimes what a candidate thinks is their strength in fact is their weakness. John Kerry thought, oh, his military record and they went right after him (inaudible). I think that all the talk about Donald Trump is not as successful, won't release his tax returns, doesn't support charities, et cetera, I think it has hurt Donald Trump.BOLLING: Can we talk about the polls a little bit? Three points now, the Fox News poll, most recent. It tightened quite a bit. Do you expect that to continue towards the finish line?PERINO: I have no idea. I mean, it just depends. So the RealClearPolitics average is like plus six because you had one poll -- I'm sorry, the AP poll today was plus 14 for Clinton. You had Fox with plus three so, let's just say it's probably up plus five. So, that's the national poll. And then you've got the battleground states which are the most important and you see that today.I think Stirewalt reported that Florida, Ohio and Georgia in early voting are really good for Trump -- the other states with early voting, not so good for Trump and better for Clinton. So, the election night is going to be worth watching because it won't be over early. Well, it could be over early, it depends on Florida as we were saying yesterday.BOLLING: That is 100 percent true. He needs Florida, but he is polling very well in Florida and for some reason when -- they are calling Florida troublesome for the Republicans because the same amount of people have requested early ballots, Republicans and Democrats and they're looking that as a negative to Republicans.WILLIAMS: Because last time it was such a big advantage for the Republicans.BOLLING: And they still lost.PERINO: That's the point.BOLLING: Maybe it has nothing to do with how many early ballots are requested.GUILFOYLE: I don't know. I mean I think that this -- anything can happen between now and election day. I really believe it especially with every day it's like the faucet keeps dripping with this person's got this thing coming out, they've got this more WikiLeaks. Who knows? There's so much of a saturation that it's all becoming overwhelming white noise.I don't know how much that (inaudible) going to like move the needle against Hillary Clinton at this point, even though some of it is pretty damning. She survived already it seems the e-mail scandal, you know, and Benghazi and it's pretty unbelievable. And in terms of Trump, who knows if they're holding back something to release, you know, last minute to suppress voter turnout.I think his people are going to come out no matter what. I think the enthusiasm that he has on his side is his best asset in terms of his die hard followers. Hillary, I mean, she had a great day today, but you know, later but Michelle Obama.BOLLING: Does -- yeah, Michelle Obama had a nice speech for Hillary. Does the media throwing her softballs like that -- does that do her a disservice, I mean, basically the echo chamber (ph) to her?GUTGELD: Well, you know, I don't know. I think it's because we've come to accept this. We know that the people who enter the media tend to be liberal. This is why, you know, Republicans always have to try harder. They always have to feel the better candidate because they know that this is one arena that they are disadvantaged.So, I think that like, the problem is, e-mails don't beat females. It's a great -- you know a story for a Hillary is a scandal but people are just more titillated and interested in the scandals and allegations that are on the side of Trump. That's why...GUILFOYLE: Pun intended.GUTFELD: ...there's always stuff -- e-mails do not beat females in salacious gossip and story.BOLLING: Well, hang in there because tonight, Donald Trump appears on ""The Factor."" We've got the first clip. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS: You believe the polls are rigged. Do you think certain news organizations and other organizations, when they poll, have their thumb on the scale and they want Hillary Clinton to come out on top in the poll, do you believe that?TRUMP: Oh, absolutely. I have no doubt about it.O'REILLY: Which one?TRUMP: Look, I won the third debate easily. It wasn't even a contest and everybody had me winning -- every poll had me winning big league. And then CNN did a poll and they had me losing somewhat. And I said, how did that happen, I wonder? And then there were other polls where, look, I mean I'm winning in certain polls. And then in other polls, the dirty polls we call them, I was losing by, you know, numbers that were ridiculous.O'REILLY: Yeah, I have all the polls here.TRUMP: I think -- I mean I think we're winning, but Bill, you look at some of these polls, it's absolutely ridiculous.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Well that full interview airs tonight at 8:00 p.m. it's going to be one you definitely want to see. Now Juan, this is something you and I argue about all the time. The internals, you know, the methodology on the polls. Besides the margin of error, internally, do you still have to look, OK, so they pick up the phone.They call a thousand people, then it will come up Democrats outweigh -- over surveyed or more Democrats surveyed than Republicans. Sometimes the skew (ph) will be nine, 10 percent more. The country isn't there. The country is about four to five percent more Democrats view themselves and register -- even registered as Democrats...WILLIAMS: But you understand, it's not that they are saying initially we want you to be a Democrat. They're just calling a pool of people and the people self-identify...BOLLING: Yeah. If you call a pool of Fox viewers and then you call a pool of CNN viewers and say, which network do you like better and you have 20 percent more Fox viewers, I'm guessing it would be skewed to the facts here.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. But they are not saying we're calling Fox viewers. They're just calling everybody. And so I mean, they do things like, for example with minorities, they have to sometimes add more in and then they, you know, we to try to weight it.BOLLING: Yeah, or they can weight it. Yes, they can play games with...WILLIAMS: But let me just tell you one thing that's so interesting to me out of these polls by the way. So now with the Fox at three points, right - - Fox at three points. That's within the margin of error, as I understand it. So, I think we're -- so you say we're even?BOLLING: No. I say within the margin of error.WILLIAMS: So we're even. You think plus three for her is even?BOLLING: No. It's within the margin of error.WILLIAMS: OK, all right. But I will say this to you, I thought...BOLLING: Yeah, we will get...WILLIAMS: Oh, right, go ahead.BOLLING: They don't want to talk anymore about polls.GUILFOYLE: Can you all talk about that during the break?WILLIAMS: We love to talk about it. In fact, he always...BOLLING: Is this a winning strategy for Trump, that the polls are rigged?GUILFOYLE: You know, I think he should just keep campaigning and say why they should choose him and have a resounding victory so that no one can even say anything about it and there's no issue for that. It's great for this country, for our election system and our process to be able to say that, look, we have fair elections in this country and despite any evidence, you know, to show there's any kind of rigging or anything. We did this investigation...PERINO: Especially when his own team is telling Bloomberg that their internal polls match the public polls. They said that. So, I don't understand what the message is of saying that there are rigged polls when they are saying that they're seeing the exact same thing.BOLLING: You know why I don't like the rigged poll thing he's doing here? It's because even if you're a Trump supporter and he is telling you the polls are rigged, you may not show up because it's rigged, rightGUTFELD: That's true. It's like you're saying why bother. And this is I think the most ominous thing that can happen out of this election, is that he is telling people -- he is acting as though he's already lost. The media is rigged. The polls are lost. Everything is corrupt. So don't bother. And then when it's over, screw everything.PERINO: No, but if he wins, then he can say, I alone can fix it. I can overcome rigged polls and skew (ph) the media and I alone can do this. So he wins either way.BOLLING: There you go. We'll leave it right there. Coming up, he's back. The infamous Obamacare architect who said we were all too stupid to know we were being duped on the president's health care law. He's now showing his face again. What is Jonathan Gruber had to say about the all-out implosion of Obamacare now, stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: All right, Juan and Eric are still talking about the polls. It lasted a whole four minutes. But we're going to talk about Obamacare because remember when a key architect of Obamacare admitted that we, the American voter were intentionally deceived to get the health care law to pass referring to us as stupid.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JONATHAN GRUBER, OBAMACARE ARCHITECT: In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- you made explicit the healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed, okay. Just like the -- people transparent -- lack of transparency is a huge political advantage and basically, you know, call this the stupidity of the American voter or whatever. But basically, that was really, really critical to get that thing to pass.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right, soon Obamacare premiums are about to skyrocket by double digits. The president's Affordable Care Act will cost millions of Americans dearly and that's no surprise to MIT professor Jonathan Gruber. He says that was the plan all along.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRUBER: Obamacare is not imploding. The main goal of Obamacare was two folds. One was to cover uninsured of which we've covered 20 million, the large extension in American history. The other is to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they have been sick. Those had been fixed. It's not a crisis. It doesn't mean the system is collapsing. The law is working as designed.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Gruber is now the Baghdad Bob of Obamacare. He said it's not imploding as the president called an emergency conference call with insurers. Here is a little bit of that.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The one thing that's been a challenge, obviously, since we passed the affordable care act is the politics of it because there is a faction of people who are continually trying to root for failure despite the fact that we keep on insuring people and folks continue to get help. So, the bottom line is that most people are going to be pleasantly surprised at just how affordable their options are if we can just get them to see for themselves.(END AUDIO CLIP)PERINO: All right. So, Eric, he says it's politics, you say it's math?BOLLING: It's just math. There's no politics at all. I'll go through very quickly as the silver plan, not the highest, not the lowest, but the silver plan. The most popular plan if you're a 40-year old male, non-smoker individual, silver plan. You're paying $411 a month, that's almost $5,000 plus a $3,600 deductible -- $8,500 out of your pocket before they -- before any insurance company kicks in a penny. A family, that rockets up to $13,000.Very quickly, the Commerce Clause prohibits government to coerce individuals to buy a good or service unless you call it a tax. And that's how the Supreme Court -- in fact, Jonathan Gruber called it a fee or a penalty and the Supreme Court switched Gruber's word and turned fee or penalty into tax thereby allowing it to become a law.PERINO: Cleaning it up for them.BOLLING: I think you can go back at some point -- I'm not sure if it did to will, well you can go back and re-litigate the Commerce Clause.GUILFOYLE: Right, just repeal it.PERINO: And there actually was a report in the ""New York Times"" today, Kimberly, that many, many more people than they anticipated are willing to accept the penalty because they're kind of used to it, right. They fill out their tax return and pretty it's simple especially if you are a younger person. It's pretty simple. You don't really have a lot of investments yet. And then you just say okay, like, fine, I will take the penalty because then I'm not going to have to spend $8,500.GUILFOYLE: Great, but when you do that basic math, they don't want to spend it, right because they are working hard for their money, probably have student loans to, and that's a big chunk. And you're asking them to basically engage in a charitable act to support a failed health care system. I mean, really? Does that make sense?Did they just get out of school and learn better than that and basic math? Why would they? You know, and why are you putting such a risk (ph) burden and then you wonder why they don't have enough money to pay back student loans.PERINO: In that same article I was thinking about you today earlier because in that same article it said, ""if we are going to raise the penalty, then we also have to increase the amount of government aid so that people can understand the penalty and can maybe get more subsidies.""GUTFELD: Right. It's all about the blob getting bigger and bigger and bigger because the whole point of government is to survive and to lie (ph) -- it's not about ever getting smaller. This whole idea of it being a problem, it's not a problem if it's for the greater good. You can do all the bad you want because your heart is in the right place. It never needs explaining. If there's a mistake in Obamacare, it's your fault the consumer or the person because like he says, you're stupid.The other thing that helps government programs is that they are so inept, universally inept, that people willingly endure it because they've come to accept it like the weather. They feel they can't do anything about the weather. They feel they can't do anything about government programs. It's so bad that it's a non-story.PERINO: You factor it into your life.GUTFELD: You factor it into your life. It's just a pain in the ass, and you know what, that's why it's a non-story.PERINO: Like the DMV.GUTFELD: Yeah, it's just a non-story that's why it doesn't have an affect.PERION: I have a question Juan about, how does President Obama answer the health insurers who might have been on that conference call today who -- they-re doing their own math and they're pulling out at a lot of these states? As I imagine that they're on the other end of the conference call looking at each other going, it's not just the politics. It's actually the system is not working.WILLIAMS: Well, no, they're looking at exactly what you are talking about. They're saying, hey, who is signing up, who is not signing up? They're making profit and loss judgments. The question is, what was this plan, you know, designed to do? And that's what you heard from Jonathan Gruber. Gruber said it was intended to insure more people who didn't have insurance and there are 20 million people who have insurance who didn't. And it was intended to do things like prevent the insurance company, I'm sorry...PERINO: Then cost curve down, I mean, that's what they said it would do.WILLIAMS: Right, so he also makes the case. I mean, this is accurate that the premiums on these plans for people who qualify actually came in lower initially and now are just back to the point where they thought they would be. But the point that I was going to make to Eric's -- to what Eric had said was that Gruber is now arguing that you should raise tax fee penalty, whatever you want to call it, and force more people into the market, Dana.BOLLING: ...I know we want to get, but my niece is a UPS Driver. She makes $13 an hour. She makes $19.50 an hour with overtime. She's doing some overtime and she literally said if I take a little bit more overtime, I'm going to get kicked into this fee, this extra tax. She's like, I can't take the overtime. They are forcing people not to work harder.PERINO: So then how does she get insurance when she's...BOLLING: She's on Obamacare.PERINO: She's on obamacare.BOLLING: She's on Obamacare.GUTFELD: She has a bad package and she works for UPS.WILLIAMS: But don't forget, again, and Gruber and the president made this point that, you know, the people who qualify, it's 85 percent of them who get subsidies, they will see no increase.PERINO: Right, but -- exactly. Right, next far left filmmaker, Michael Moore's profane prediction on whether Donald Trump will win the presidency is probably not what you're expecting. We have the bleep button available. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Well, Michael Moore is sounding the alarm bell to his fellow Democrats and any undecided voters nationwide.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: Trump's election is going to be the biggest (BLEEP) ever recorded in human history. And it will feel good, for a day. You know, maybe a week. Possibly a month.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Well the far left filmmaker is of course for Hillary but he predicts Donald Trump is going to come out on top on November 8th in his new documentary ""Trumpland."" Why you ask? Because the Republican nominee's message has deeply resonated with so many voters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLP)MORE: Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he's saying the things to people who are hurting and it's like every beaten down nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump. He is the human Molotov cocktail that they've been waiting for.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Greg, I see you nodding in agreement.GUTFELD: Yes. Powerful stuff. And it's odd, because he looks so much like Large Marge from ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure,"" that new hairstyle.Anyway, you know what he's doing? Which I find really -- he's saying something pretty powerful. It's the opposite of what's happening in the Republican Party when you read, like, Amanda Carpenter's last piece about Republican women.Michael Moore is saying the Democratic Party is losing millions of angry men, the working stiff. The Democrats are losing millions of angry men. It's the yin to the yang of the Republicans losing millions of angry women. It's exactly the same problem. But in reverse.And he's not -- by the way, he's not -- what he's doing -- which is very, very smart, that is different from what Bill Clinton said and what Hillary said. Bill Clinton called them rednecks. Hillary called them deplorables. But Moore is -- he's not -- he's not condemning the support. He doesn't like the candidate. He's condemning Trump. But he's not condemning Trump supporters, which is a very important thing to say.He's a smart fellow, even though I disagree with almost everything he said. Because remember, he also said if you vote for Trump, you're a legal terrorist or you're supporting legal terrorism.GUILFOYLE: Wonder if he'd like to take that back.GUTFELD: What? Yes, maybe.GUILFOYLE: Why don't you call him? Text him after the show.All right, Dana, what do think?PERINO: He might have a chance to take it back, if he wants to. Because I just found out he's going to be on Megyn Kelly's show tonight at 9 p.m. So she'll have a chance to talk to him.I think if he wants to make himself feel better about the election result, he should look at Larry Sabato. If you're a Republican, it was depressing. Because this morning in ""Crystal Ball,"" which is Electoral College ratings, he holds steady and says Hillary Clinton at 352 electoral votes, Trump 173. So I think -- I wonder if this is a little bit of a scare tactic for Democrats.GUTFELD: Yes, it is.PERINO: I agree on the messaging. Donald Trump has absolutely done that. Republicans are accused of, and they were rightly to be accused of, ignoring those voters. Now the Democrats are at risk of doing the same thing.And then, to your point, from an economics perspective, the vision of what happens with the technological revolution, where the jobs go. Everybody needs to focus on...GUTFELD: That's not a new...PERINO: ... helping those people.GUTFELD: That's not a news story, the loss of jobs through automation. That's not a news story.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness. All right. Bolling, what's going on here?BOLLING: So I think he is -- he's right. And I think he is right that there are a lot of people who feel that their voice is not being heard in Washington. But guess what? It happened on the Democrat side, too, as Bernie Sanders supporters. Only Hillary Clinton happened to beat him out. And as this week, WikiLeaks, we find out some of the methods that they used to win that.GUILFOYLE: They were aligned. DWS.BOLLING: It does make a point. Look, Donald Trump is definitely tapping into some anger and some people who feel like they have been ignored. And I think that's a good thing.If there is an opportunity for Trump, it would be tap into that on the Democrat side and say, ""You know, it's not just them. It's you, as well, Democrats. Come -- I am the outsider. I'm not the business as usual,"" as Michael Moore points out.By the way, I would say the biggest ""F-U"" wouldn't be Donald Trump winning the presidency. It would probably be the American Revolution. Remember when we did that, 13 colonies said ""F-U, British. We got this""?GUILFOYLE: Remember that?BOLLING: I do.GUILFOYLE: Yes. All right. Juan.WILLIAMS: Is that right?GUILFOYLE: What do you think about Michael Moore? What's he up to?WILLIAMS: Well, I suspect that what Dana said is true. You know, it's a way of avoiding complacency and also reminds me of is that Vice President Biden on the Democratic side has been saying, ""You know what?"" One of the last things he wants to do is make sure Democrats don't forget working- class people. Don't think that they have lost that constituency for all time. I think everybody is aware of that.The question is, if you are willing -- this is what, by the way, Michael Moore concludes. What's fascinating is the far right has taken to a Michael Moore movie, which is mind-boggling. The reason they take to it is they play some of the segments, like what we saw. But he goes on then, beyond what everybody on the right is watching, to praise Hillary Clinton and say she's much better than he ever thought in the past when he wouldn't support her. He thinks that she knows how to solve problems for America.GUTFELD: But...BOLLING: That's hypocritical, though.GUTFELD: But you know, why -- why are the Democrats losing males? Because, from the liberal perspective, the worst thing you can be is a white male. You are -- you are obviously a bigot. You're obviously sexist. You are crude. You have to be a sensitive, new age leftist if you -- if you're a male, or you're done.WILLIAMS: I don't...GUILFOYLE: Otherwise, you're responsible for their list of grievances.GUTFELD: Yes. That resonates.GUILFOYLE: OK. We have to leave it.Next, Justice Clarence Thomas on the political stand-off over Supreme Court nominations. His rare remarks next. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: It's very rare to hear Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas speak from the bench. But the conservative magistrate spoke publically yesterday in Washington. The Heritage Foundation invited him to celebrate his 25 years on the bench, and he had some very strong words for the current state of our government. He thinks it's broken.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS, SUPREME COURT: I think we have become very comfortable with not thinking things through and debating things. I think that we have decided that, rather than confront the disagreements and the differences of opinion, we'll just simply annihilate the person who disagrees with me. I don't think that's going to work. At some point we have got to recognize that we're destroying our institutions, and we're undermining our institutions.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: I thought that was on target. The justice was responding to a question about the high court's confirmation process. He didn't mention the stalled nomination of Merrick Garland. But Kimberly, you can't help but think about what happened to him 25 years ago that, you know...GUILFOYLE: Of course.WILLIAMS: ... he personally was so vilified.GUILFOYLE: He really was. And he's proved himself to be a very capable justice, you know, someone who is greatly admired, a good man, a hard worker. We're very lucky to have him. But you saw that. It was just -- almost just politics of, like, personal destruction, trying to ruin a man who has accomplished a great deal, you know, in his life.And so -- and he doesn't speak -- I mean, you very rarely hear from justice Thomas. Right? So the fact that we're hearing from him is kind of a very unique opportunity to get some insight into a man who's -- obviously, lives a very fascinating life on the bench.WILLIAMS: So now, Eric, we come up to a moment where, again, you know, we're stuck. Merrick Garland is there. The question is what happens, let's say, if you get a liberal like Hillary Clinton in the White House, and she nominates a liberal justice? Senator McCain, Senator Cruz, they're saying, ""We won't consider even putting anybody on the bench.""BOLLING: Merrick Garland, prior to her being sworn in. Maybe they should rethink that if Trump doesn't win the election. Because he may be the best choice going forward.WILLIAMS: But they just said they wouldn't pick anybody.BOLLING: Well, they can say that now, and they may change their mind. The nomination is still there. They can still take it up, I would assume. They're probably just saying that.Because they don't want to acknowledge a Hillary Clinton presidency. Let's just -- they're probably going forward with, ""Hey, Trump is going to win."" But I will tell you, don't leave, Clarence.GUILFOYLE: Please stay.BOLLING: We are really in trouble if you don't help...GUILFOYLE: Please stay.BOLLING: ... fix the broken institutions in D.C.WILLIAMS: Wow. Dana.PERINO: Well, one thing we didn't show -- and I don't know if we talked about it. But when Scalia died there was reporting about the court and the friendships that are -- that are behind the scenes.WILLIAMS: Right.PERINO: And that they all actually really get along. They have a common cause. And that they enjoy each other's intellectual capabilities.And the writings of Clarence Thomas are amazing. It's good to hear from him, but I would assume Kimberly would agree that...GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: ... from a legal standpoint, he's one of the best writers that we have.And Juan, it was your son, Raffi Williams, who wrote a piece about the new African-American Museum that doesn't celebrate him in any way in Washington, D.C., which is a real shame.GUILFOYLE: Can you do something about that? Juan?WILLIAMS: I would like to do something about that. I know the people over there. And, you know, I just can't understand it. Because one of the arguments I read today said, actually, in the post-civil rights area, he's certainly an important voice of Africa -- I think he, in terms of American history, this is one of the most important African-Americans of all -- I'm saying this as his friend. So if you want to write me and complain, but that's what I think. And I -- and he and I disagree on a whole lot of stuff.Greg.GUTFELD: Well, white liberal guilt turns into open hatred when faced with a black conservative. I mean, Thomas remains proof that the mainstream media -- there's one kind of acceptable black man. It's the black man who agrees with everything in the mainstream media, so that eliminates Justice Thomas.But the one thing he brought up, which is very important -- and we talk about it a lot -- is this polarization. Unity is dead. I mean, I don't know how -- we talk about unifying a country. I don't believe it's possible. We have these balkanized buckets of knowledge now on the Internet, where if we want to go and find something that agrees with us, we can go -- we can bypass everybody and go to one website and find that thing that makes us feel comfortable. People on the left, people on the right, we find the comfortable little strain. We stay in it. And we never have to talk to anybody again. Scary.WILLIAMS: That's really lamentable. Anyway, stay right there. We'll show you some of what happened today on the campaign trail. That's next.(COMMERCIAL REAL)GUILFOYLE: I won't do that, Kimberly. I won't do that. Not anymore. Wondering what happened today on the trail? Hillary Clinton, you know her, campaigned for the first time with the first lady. And Trump's had enough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I think we've had enough of the Clintons, in all fairness.Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the president.HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election.I want to thank our first lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value.MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY: Hillary doesn't play. She has more experience and exposure to the presidency than any candidate in our lifetime. Yes, more than Barack, more than Bill. So she is absolutely ready to be commander in chief on day one. And, yes, she happens to be a woman.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Kimberly, how interesting is it that Hillary is speaking in front of stripes when she should be wearing them in prison?GUILFOYLE: Lock her up.GUTFELD: Yes. Lock her up.GUILFOYLE: That pleases me. OK.I thought Michelle Obama was fantastic. And when you saw the crowd, they were super excited. She's a great speaker. She's confident, smart, talented woman. Listen, it seemed like, well, that sounds like somebody could be running for office and would be electable. Am I right?Now, she made one misstep when she says Hillary doesn't play. Hillary does. Pay for play.GUTFELD: Juan? Thoughts, feelings, emotions?WILLIAMS: Well, I was just surprised. I'm really surprised that Michelle Obama has become a star in this cycle. I mean, she's the No. 1 surrogate right now.GUILFOYLE: Why are you surprised?WILLIAMS: Because I didn't think that she was really going to get involved. And also...GUTFELD: Because she's a woman, Juan?WILLIAMS: No. Because...GUTFELD: A black woman? You make me sick.WILLIAMS: There we go.GUTFELD: Go ahead. I'm kidding.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. If I can make you sick, I'm thinking, wow, I must be saying something.GUILFOYLE: Something get some -- somebody get some Obamacare.WILLIAMS: Eric, do I get credit for that?BOLLING: No. I think it was hilarious.She's so capable. I mean, you could actually see a future in politics for Michelle Obama. She was fantastic.WILLIAMS: I don't think she wants one.GUILFOYLE: Many have said it. Many have said it.BOLLING: In the past two or three days, we've had Elizabeth Warren outshining Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama outshining Hillary Clinton.So I looked it up. Yes, former presidents or outgoing presidents have campaigned for the chosen successor. But first time ever in this election, the first time the president has ever brought the successor on Air Force 1. Now 180,000 bucks an hour, I'm not sure that plays -- that should play well.GUTFELD: That's a good point.Dana, do you -- it's kind of amazing what the first lady did, given that -- does she -- do they really get along? Was that amazing acting? I mean, you know what's behind the scenes. They must hate each other. Right? I don't know.PERINO: No. There's somebody else that is a guest on the network that will tell you all sorts of things like that. I'm not going to be one of them, because I don't know what their relationship is.GUTFELD: That person rhymes with Juan Bolton.PERINO: No. It doesn't. It doesn't, actually.GUILFOYLE: What?PERINO: Hillary Clinton is able do something that's not easy for somebody in a leadership position. And that is to take a step back and let other people speak for her. As Eric was saying, Elizabeth Warren rallied the crowd the other day. Joe Biden does it for her in Pennsylvania. Michelle Obama, most valuable surrogate of the campaign trail.Trump doesn't need any. He is his most valuable surrogate.GUILFOYLE: He's the wow.PERINO: I don't know if -- I don't think Michelle Obama will go into politics. But I could see something that you haven't heard yet.GUTFELD: Supreme Court?PERINO: Obama TV.BOLLING: Very nice.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: A little competition.GUTFELD: I could see Supreme Court justice. That's what I could see.PERINO: OK.GUTFELD: Or maybe president of the U.N. Or maybe the world. Why not president of the world?GUILFOYLE: She's not going to want to be Supreme Court justice.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Takes up too much time. There's no dough in it.WILLIAMS: Are you talking about him or her?GUTFELD: Her.GUILFOYLE: Either one.WILLIAMS: Oh, I thought you said ""he.""GUILFOYLE: Either one.GUTFELD: Any job where you can wear a robe.GUILFOYLE: Let's go.GUTFELD: I've been looking for that.GUILFOYLE: God, I still have that on my phone. So disturbing.GUTFELD: A picture of me in a robe. OK, ""One More Thing"" is up next. Sorry.GUILFOYLE: Short robe.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Time for ""One More Thing."" Who's up first? Dana.PERINO: You know I love the World Series. I did my up ""One More Thing"" yesterday, and I have one today. Because an Ohio University student named Charlie got a surprise from his dad earlier in the week. He got tickets to game one of the World Series in Cleveland for Charlie and his brother. The only problem: Charlie had class that night. So he checked into class, gave his homework to somebody else to turn in, and he left and went to the game. Problem is the professor took attendance at the end of class.And so he got a little e-mail that said, ""Excuse me. You weren't there. What's going on here?""So the kid very smartly sent back an explanation, ""To be completely honest, I came and basically, I got to go to the game.""And the professor said, ""That looks like an impeccable excuse. No repercussions. Go Tribe.""BOLLING: There you go.PERINO: That was a good excuse.BOLLING: Good thing he wasn't in Chicago.GUTFELD: I think they should both be arrested.BOLLING: There you go. Greg.GUTFELD: I haven't done this in a while, a banned phrase. My banned phrase: ""in the tank."" Now, whenever you criticize somebody -- let's say you criticize Trump and somebody goes, ""You're in the tank for Hillary"" or if you criticize Hillary, ""Oh, you're in the tank for Trump."" Or if you're at a restaurant trying to steal a lobster, they're like, ""Get out of the tank.""GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: This emotional response, which is what it is, it's a baby response, prevents you from exercising the engine of criticism that helps you, like, frame your arguments. You shouldn't be scared of people disagreeing with you. You should embrace it. It makes you a better person.PERINO: Can we hashtag tonight #babyresponse to everybody who trolls us?GUTFELD: Baby response! ""Oh, you're in the tank.""GUILFOYLE: Baby response. Oh, my goodness.Oh, you're in the tree.GUTFELD: I'm in the tree.GUILFOYLE: Yes, you always are in the tree.OK. So in other news, with no animation, my ""One More Thing."" So this is funny. Sometimes women try to teach their husbands -- you know, like, teach an old dog new tricks. Right? And teach him a lesson. No, not like that. And so she was trying to tell him, ""Listen, you're wasting a lot of money by playing this lottery."" So she went and bought -- and her name's Linda Blackwell; she's 57 -- a $10 Carolina Million scratch-off ticket on Saturday.Guess what?PERINO: No way.GUILFOYLE: One million big ones.WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.GUILFOYLE: She's like, my gosh. And there it is right there. So it's pretty exciting. She didn't teach her husband a lesson. In fact, then he was like, ""I told you."" And so now she's going to buy a home. She's going to help her daughter. And she's going to put money into her two granddaughter's college fund. I love it.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: After taxes, people, $415,000.PERINO: That's it?GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: Wow. Not so big a check after all, Kimberly.BOLLING: Take it, though.WILLIAMS: So as we all know, Justin Timberlake got in hot water earlier this week for taking a selfie while he was in the voting booth. Last night on ""The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,"" Timberlake, chastened, had some sage advice for future voters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIMMY FALLON, HOST, NBC'S ""THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JIMMY FALLON"": Do you have advice for anyone out there?JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, SINGER/ACTOR: Yes. Close up? Oh, yes. Get out and vote. But don't -- don't take a picture of yourself in there.I had no idea.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: You just heard it from Justin: vote but don't take a picture while doing it. And don't worry: the district attorney decided that prosecuting Timberlake would be a waste of time and money.BOLLING: Yes. It's against the law, though.OK. So the white board -- I think we should call this the right board. Two months ago, we talked about Teneo. Remember that? We did a white board on Teneo. This came out today from WikiLeaks e-mails.GUILFOYLE: Wow.BOLLING: Check this out.GUILFOYLE: That's incredible.BOLLING: Coca-Cola dropped $4.3 million into Teneo that ended up in Bill Clinton's coffers. Dow Chemical, $19 million. UBS, $2 million.And this one right here is really disturbing. Laureate University, a public college, paid him $17.6 million to be an honorary chancellor. All this money got funneled through to Teneo and ended up in Bill Clinton's to the tune of 50 million bucks as of 2011, $66 million through 2020. And included things like travel, vacations, hospitality.PERINO: I thought that said vaccination.BOLLING: Vacations.GUILFOYLE: Maybe.PERINO: It does. It does say that.GUILFOYLE: A few things.BOLLING: They are basically a broker for Bill Clinton. A hundred and 16 million bucks.PERINO: Broker or launderer?BOLLING: I'm not going that far. I'll go with broker.PERINO: I gave you an opening.GUILFOYLE: They get away with everything, Juan.BOLLING: Set your DVRs so you never miss an episode of ""The Five."" That's it for us. ""Special Report.""GUILFOYLE: They get away with everything.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
