READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.DEMOCRATS SLAMMING GOP PLAN TO CUT TRILLIONS IN GOV'T SPENDINGCharles Payne: Democrats have one game plan. That's buying votes. That's it. Fiscal responsibility. Here's a crazy thing. You think about literature, it's always about being able to go back to the past and see what you've done wrong. The ghost of Christmas past. We've seen this from the Roman Empire to modern day Greeks. It's all about keeping power for the moment no matter what the destruction is going to be in the future. Judge, that's beautiful.Dagen McDowell: I think these votes fail when it comes to budgets. You have the republicans trying to use the war account to skirt capital military spending. If you want to spend the money, come up with the offset somewhere else.Charlie Gasparino: Listen, the American people voted for this. I don't think -- interest rates though that does help when you have low interest rates and you can borrow at almost no cost. More to do with the political will of the American people. We put in divided government, we elect people that really don't care about the budget and that like to spend. It permeates the entire Republican Party as democrats. Elect one party, the republicans. You will get more budget cuts. They don't have a perfect answer.Ben Stein: There are no easy solutions as Mr. Biden would say. We are between a rock and hard place. Number one item essential, defend America. Get rid of the sequester. Stop the gap on defense spending. Two, i hate to say this, but it doesn't really matter what interest rates are. We sell a huge percentage of our debt to the federal reserve. Costs nothing for minting money. We've got to figure out a way to make some rise in income tax for very high income people like Charles Payne and others on this show. We cannot continue to let these people pay very, very low income taxes. The main thing is let's not quibble about tiny amounts here and there. How much do you need to defend America? That's what you've got.Adam Lashinksy: I agree with Ben in the sense that if you look out over the next 40 to 50 years, we need to prepare ourselves for a confrontation with china. I would say $600 billion is not a meaningless number. The question with is what's the right number. We node to start there. By the way, the conversation we are having is the conversation that congress and the president ought to be having. This is called a conversation. >> They are not having it. They are not having it. This is another one of the things I have on my to-do list. If you are not going to have in Washington, I might as well start the debate on this show.HILLARY'S ECONOMIC ADVISORCharles Payne : Anyone with a 401(k) right now is rejoicing they didn't sell at that particular time. We should be putting a certain fortune of money into the market, into great american companies. Having said that, imagine a government in charge of your retirement? Disability --Charlie Gasparino : There was a great story in the Wall Street Journal the other day about a guy passed away. He worked at a gas station. He saved just by buying simple stocks, high dividend stocks. $8 Million. This guy worked at a gas station.Dagen McDowell: The reason i love 401(k) plans, that is your money. That is in an account, it belongs to you. You can use it, you can borrow from it, you can use it to make a first-time home purchase. It's yours. It's not a government promise. They are taking money out of your paycheck for social security and they are promising to give you a benefit down the road. I think money in investment accounts is yours feels a whole heck of a lot better.Adam Lashinsky: I can envision a scenario where the government set up a retirement program where the rules were very clear where they could help people limit their downsize. We have to be honest about the fact that a lot of people lost a lot of their retirement savings.Adam Lashinsky: Any investor can put his money in treasury bonds. If you want a good long term return you get an index fund of great U.S. Stocks. I wasn't laughing at you. I was laughing at the funny interchange in all of us. Neil, I don't know why you are not host of a late night talk show like my friend Jimmy Kimmel.STUDY: PRES SUGGESTS MANDATORY VOTING WOULD TAKE BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICSBen Stein : He's against anything making people show an id so they can get government issued health insurance so that's another problem. I don't think it's a good idea at all. Look, the democrats are such liars saying that's all about big money and they want to squeeze big money out of politics. They're the ones that get most of the big money toe nations it's all just a typical democrat lie.Dagen McDowell: Voting is speech and if you make it mandatory it is no longer free. That goes against everything we believe in.Charlie Gasparino: I wonder why he didn't like compare to Nazi Germany or soviet Russia. I think mandatory voting there.Adam Lashinsky: I didn't hear the president say anything about mandatory voting. I heard him say it would be better if everybody voted. Perhaps we could come up with incentives for people to vote.STOCK PICKS Charles Payne- EOGAdam Lashinsky-IYFBen Stein- BAV"

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: With Corey, I'm really proud of him. He did a great job. But we are going to go a little bit of a different route.BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS: So it's a different style, it's a different style and you're bring in some --TRUMP: It is a little different style, yes, a little different style.COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: I have no regrets when it comes to this campaign. I have been given such an opportunity and a privilege. If somebody would have said to me 18 months ago, you'll be managing the candidate through 37 state victories, 14 million votes, more votes than anyone in the history of the Republican Party, I would say, is that possible? Look what he's been able to achieve, and I've been a small part of that.(END VIDEO CLIPS)SHANNON BREAM, GUEST ANCHOR: All right, there is a shakeup in the Trump campaign today. Let's bring in our panel to talk about that and more: Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard; Lisa Booth, columnist for The Washington Examiner; Ed O'Keefe, reporter with The Washington Post, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Welcome to you all. Steve, I will start with you. What does it say to you? Is this a plus, a shakeup, a reset? What does it say?STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I think it's an attempt at reset. Look, anybody who's been covering this campaign has heard stories about Corey Lewandowski chewing out staffers or having conflict with Paul Manafort who has been the de facto campaign manager for a while. So I think that some kind of shakeup was likely. He had a high profile skirmish, of course with Michelle Fields. His name has been in the news. So I think that is what this is an attempt to do, to reset the campaign.This is also a campaign that's had several bad weeks. I think you can make an argument that bad weeks back since Indiana with one controversy after another. And unlike the primary season where these controversies didn't really seem to affect him, didn't affect his poll rating, didn't affect his ability to win primaries, they are affecting him I the polls right now. And you are certainly seeing them reflected in other comments that you are getting from other Republicans about the party's nominee, more skepticism about him as the nominee. So I think this is an attempt to try to put all of that behind them to say we are about to get serious and here is the reset.BREAM: All right, speaking of polls, we have a new one out from Monmouth today putting Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton head-to-head. Among registered voters he is down by seven points, likely voters, he is down eight points. If you look at the overall Real Clear Politics average, and we like to keep track of that, Clinton there is at six percentage points in the positive against Trump. Lisa, with Paul Manafort now firmly at the helm of this campaign, how does the tone change, how do they tackle these numbers?LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: I agree with Steve. I think this is a really positive step for the Donald Trump campaign. And look, Corey Lewandowski inarguable failed Donald Trump in my opinion. He failed to set him up for a primary campaign that would take him to the general election. He had no fundraising base, he had no grassroots, no infrastructure, no data and analytics team, no political team, no communications team. He was not prepared for a general election. He was inadequately prepared for a general election. So I think this is a positive step.I mean, look, if Donald Trump had any semblance of a ground game in Iowa, he could have put this thing away a lot sooner than getting to Indiana because he would have swept Iowa and New Hampshire. He would have swept South Carolina and he would have swept Nevada, and by that time this thing would essentially be over. You would never have Mitt Romney come out against him. He would not have had tens of millions of dollars in negative ad buys spent against him. So I think Corey Lewandowski inarguably failed him. It was time to let him go and move forward toward a more serious campaign.BREAM: One of the other things in polling today have to do with favorability. Both Trump and Clinton are upside down on this one but Trump more so than Clinton. His unfavorable is at 57 percent, Clinton at 52 percent. What do they do to turn that around? Is it possible?ED O'KEEFE, WASHINGTON POST: You know, I spent a lot of time in the last few weeks talking primarily to the folks who will formalize this whole thing at the convention in Cleveland, the delegates themselves. And I was struck. You go back, Steve, to May with the Indiana primaries and the troubles brewing then. I first caught wind of them I think it was in early June when there was a fight going on in North Carolina regarding the bathroom bills, the so called bathroom bills. In talking to some delegates around that time, they said, you know, we are hearing crickets from Trump on this. Any other Republican nominee, whether it was Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, would have been in North Carolina standing with Governor McCrory and the Republican legislators, saying I'm with you on this. There's no doubt that the Republican Party stands for these kinds of social conservative principals. But we heard nothing from them.And then this past week, they are concerned about the fact that he's calling for new gun laws that are failing tonight on Capitol Hill. They say that's a settled issue in the party. Why is he discussing these things? He is not cultivating conservatives in the party.BREAM: But some of what people love about him, Charles, is that he isn't a party guy, that he's not controlled by the party. That's one of his big appealing principles to folks who really do like him.James Rosen reported tonight on this big move, the never-Trump, turn the delegates to turn against him to change the rules or do something. Does that go anywhere?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: It will depend on how Trump behaves. If he continues on the trajectory he's been since he wrapped it up in Indiana, I'm not sure I could see the revolution succeeding. But I can see a revolution, and I can see a pretty raucous convention.Look, I think all of this hinges on how Trump behaves himself. When a baseball team is losing, as you know, they fire the manager. That, of course, is just a way of pretending to do something because it's the players, not the manager. This has nothing to do with the campaign manager. He was trying to accommodate himself to the candidate. It's Trump who doesn't believe in analytics, doesn't believe in infrastructure. He believes he lands in a plane, he makes a speech, he has a crowd that is absolutely delirious, and that's how he's won all the way here. That's not going to win a general election but he's insistent on that.I think it will all depend on whether Manafort can, as nobody else has yet, constrain and control him or to have him exercise self-control where he does what you are supposed to do. And I think if he does he has a better chance in the general election. Being eccentric, anti-establishment and all that might work with the small universe of a primary. It's not going to work in the general election.HAYES: But what is the likelihood of that happening, honestly? Why would anybody think at this point that Donald Trump, a, could change, and, b, would change? We have seen the same Donald Trump since before he announced. The people who love it love that Donald Trump. But he's been encouraged by Reince Priebus, by Paul Ryan, by Mitch McConnell, by other Washington Republicans, but Republicans outside Washington. He's been begged by conservatives to speak about their issues. He simply refuses to do it because he's Donald Trump. It has some appeal. Obviously, it got him as far as it got him. But there's no reason whatsoever to think that Donald Trump is going to change right now.BREAM: But he has had to clarify a number of these issues. Ed Mentioned the bathroom bill and gun control. And there many times that he does speak. And then the party conservative and others speak up, Lisa, and then he is modifying or backtracking or explaining.BOOTHE: There's no doubt he's had a series of missteps. Anyone can point that out. Just watch the news to figure that out.But the one thing that Donald Trump hates is losing. Look at the general election polls right now. Granted he's more competitive in the swing state polls. If you look at the battleground states, he's actually more where Mitt Romney was in 2012 at this point. Granted, Sanders supporters haven't come to Hillary Clinton so that could change. But there's nothing more he hates than losing. And so I think looking at the polls, realizing the fact that he could actually lose this thing is a little bit of a wake-up call for him. I think we have seen the fact of his usage of a teleprompter, which he really hasn't done throughout the duration of this election, and also the firing of Corey Lewandowski are potential steps toward that realization that he needs to sort of realign his campaign and get a little bit more serious.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DOUG MCKELWAY: And we're back with the panel now. While you were gone we just heard another barb from Donald Trump calling Bill Kristol, quote, ""a real loser.""Let's take a look at the national polls right now. The Real Clear Politics average has Trump up 17 points at this point. But the fascinating polls really are the state ones. The Iowa average RCP poll has Cruz up 2.8 percent. And New Hampshire is turning into a real dogfight. Trump up 13.7 percent there, but look at the horserace just underneath that, tightly packed group of New Hampshire, Rubio, Cruz, Christie, all just behind Trump with Bush and Kasich not far behind. And we are seeing real infighting there, Charles.     CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: It implies that if you had some consolidation you take out Cruz, but consolidation among the others, then you would really have a head-to-head. And you reported a little earlier, you have had the internecine fighting between the non-Trump-ites. You've got Christie attacking Rubio strangely for nonattendance in the Senate, number one, they have all derided the Senate as a completely useless body, so why would it matter if he showed up for the vote or not.     And, second, I think that Christie is actually renounced his residency in New Jersey since he has already moved into New Hampshire. So he is hardly one to accuse another of abandoning his duties, whatever he was elected to do. It's very odd. I don't think that really works. But it shows how all of them are scrambling to come in second or perhaps even to pull out a miracle victory in New Hampshire to end up as the one in the finals.MCKELWAY: You mentioned Jeb attacking him for missed votes, Rubio's missed votes in the Senate. A Rubio spokesman firing back hard today with this comment, quote, ""No other candidate for president has received more classified intelligence briefings or better understands the threats facing our nation today than Marco. It's sad to see Jeb's joyful campaign reduced to such intellectual dishonesty.And Rubio got another endorsement today from a real GOP superstar. Let's listen up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TREY GOWDY, R, SOUTH CAROLINA: I found my candidate. It's Marco Rubio. I hope that you will give him a chance to convince you that he should be your candidate, too. Help me welcome Marco Rubio.     (APPLAUSE)     (END VIDEO CLIP)MCKELWAY: Charlie, does that make a difference, do endorsements make a difference in this day and age?CHARLES HURT, POLITICAL COLUMNIST: Sure, endorsements are important. I don't know that getting a member of Congress to endorse your campaign at this point does much good. And I agree with what Charles is saying, this idea that they are going to attack Marco Rubio for missing votes in a body that they are all ridiculing is sort of insane. And especially because one of the big hits against him among real strong conservatives is the votes that he has taken with regards to immigration.I think one of the real big problems right now is that, you know, the number two guy, and the number one guy in Iowa and the number two guy nationally, Ted Cruz, is not as unpalatable as Donald Trump, but he is still very unpalatable for a lot of establishment Republicans. And because of that unique dynamic, it's just very hard for -- you are looking for a third tier person to step up and become that challenger.MCKELWAY: That's it for the panel. But stay tuned to find out who is putting words into the mouths of Democratic presidential candidates.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
