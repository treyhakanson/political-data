This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On our buzz meter this Sunday, the media start obsessing on hand-to-hand campaign combat as Donald Trump charge that Ted Cruz and the Republican Party are stealing his delegates.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The Republican National Committee, they should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap to happen.CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: Trump has a very good argument. Popular votes should decide the nominee. The guy who gets -- the person who gets most votes should be the nominee.GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS: He uses the banking rules to help him screw other people and now he's mad that he's getting screwed?BEN STEIN, ECONOMIST: He's a big sulking baby. I mean, this is -- this is incredible.A.B. STODDARD, THE HILL: I think actually this is really going to help Trump. The Colorado situation is just too weird.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: But is the press overplaying the argument that Trump is in trouble or underplaying his difficulty in playing by the established rules? Is Trump softening his style? He's sitting down to clear the air with Megyn Kelly.And why is Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg taking not so subtle shots at the Donald? The media suddenly fascinated by the bitter battle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WOLF BLITZER, CNN: Secretary, senator, please...HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That day has been -- it's linked in races in...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: Let's do it.BLITZER: If you're both screaming at each other, the viewers won't be able to hear either of you.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: But did CNN's Brooklyn brawl change the race? Plus, a new HBO film on the Anita Hill hearings.(VIDEO PROMO FOR HBO'S 'CONFIRMATION')KURTZ: Is the movie, as some republicans say slanted against Clarence Thomas? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is Media Buzz.Donald Trump may be heading for a big win in New York two days from now but the media's focus has been on the convoluted nature of how delegates are chosen in some states.Ever since the Colorado Convention gave all the delegates to Ted Cruz without most GOP voters have been able to express their preference, same thing in Wyoming yesterday with Cruz winning all those delegates. Trump calls the system rigged and corrupt but has also been blamed for a feeble effort on the ground.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: Does it say something -- and your critics says it says something about your leadership ability if you, for somebody tell themselves as somebody who is an organizational genius, who's created this amazing business organization that you couldn't create an organization on the ground that can beat Ted Cruz's organization.TRUMP: Number one, I started with a $1 million loan, I built a $10 billion company. Well, there are a lot of similarities. In this case, I won most of it. I mean you know, you can say what about organization? Well, how come I'm leading by hundreds of delegates? How come I'm leading by millions of votes?SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald has been yelling and screaming, a lot of whining. I'm sure some cursing.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: No cursing on this show. Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Heidi Przybyla, Senior Political Correspondent for USA Today. Lisa Boothe, the republican strategist and columnist for the Washington Examiner. And Juan Williams, the FOX News analyst co-host of The Five and author of the new book, We, The people.KURTZ: Heidi, two days until New York. Are the media fixated on the state by state delegate's fight, the arcane rules and all of the sausage making?HEIDI PRZYBYLA, USA TODAY SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Truth be told, Howie, I've always been a little disturbed by the tendency of the media to cover politics like it's a sports match. And I feel like this new phase that we're going into right now really could have the potential to put that on steroids.We're seeing a good example of that right now where you just had, you know, these two voter less contests in Wyoming and Colorado and then in West Virginia, it's possible that Trump could win but fall behind in the delegates.And the critical thing is we're having that happen on the democratic side, too, in terms of the complaints. So instead of focusing on the process, let's have that debate about the system, let's have that debate about solutions.KURTZ: So in the media debate about this, as Trump is obviously put this front and center, Lisa. Has the tone of the coverage tilted toward the view that he should be better at playing this game or that the game is absurdly complicated and unfair?LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND COLUMNIST: Well, I think the coverage is in pretty evenly split as evidenced by some of the clips you showed earlier with even Chris Matthews of MSNBC coming to the defense of Donald Trump.And we know Donald Trump could dominate another news cycle. This is what he does so well as someone who worked in political communications that I'm somewhat in awe of his ability to dominate the news media attention because they're not talking about Ted Cruz's victory in Colorado and Wyoming.They're talking about is the system rigged and asking the questions. So you know, leave the Donald Trump to be able to capture the news media's attention.KURTZ: Juan, even the pundits that say, ""Well look, the rules are announced in advance and all the campaigns in lieu with this going in."" They're very -- they're very often, very quick to say, ""Well I'm not defending the system.""Yeah, the system stinks. Should there be more media outrage that the fact that you know, this has gone on in past years but wasn't a focus because we didn't have this odd situation, that you can win a state where basically it's controlled by party insiders and most voters will get the vote?JUAN WILLIAMS, AUTHOR AND FOX NEWS ANALYST CO-HOST: Well, you know, the odd part for me is that this is the rules -- these have been the rules forever. I mean, you can do a historical rift on this and go back to Reagan and Ford in '76 and Convention fights and -- you know, it was wonderfully told this week that Ronald Reagan would say to delegates, ""How you would like if I had Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne come to me to talk to you?""KURTZ: I love that story. OK, so we know this exists. So the real question then becomes there's a populous mood in this country, anti-establishment and anti-party. And those people are with Trump and they're saying the system is rigged. Why is it that people get votes or don't get the votes as we saw in Wyoming?WILLIAMS: I think that's because the press reflect that.KURTZ: I think we're trying to reflect it. The problem for me, and I'll tell you something, as someone who's covered politics seriously is that the rules are the rules. So if you don't know the rules, you should have done a better job at playing the game.PRZYBYLA: In some of these states, the rules were changed. Back in August, the Denver Post published an article saying they were taking away the straw poll and they've mentioned Donald Trump by name, and this could hurt him. So there is a place for this debate I think.BOOTHE: Can you blame the media for focusing on the rules to the extent that they have? This is the first time potentially in 40 years where there have been contested conventions for the republicans.Potentially the first time 68 years that it goes beyond about. This is essentially putting a bone in front of dogs. I mean, the press is salivating at the idea of a contested convention. Think, can you blame them for sort of the -- the hyper media attention of the...KURTZ: We salivate about a lot of things. And, of course, it is part of the story because it may ultimately decide the nominee. But I just think about the average voter is sort of like, ""Why am I hearing more about taxes and jobs and health care and ISIS as opposed to this process story which the press tends to like?""Look, another thing that made a lot of news this week, it's on the cover of The New York Post, was Megyn Kelly and Donald Trump. Let's take a look at a clip. We'll start with Megyn.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS: The meeting was at my request and Mr. Donald Trump was gracious enough to agree to it. We met for about an hour, just the two of us, and had a chance to clear the air.TRUMP: Well, Megyn called and she wanted to come up and she came up to Trump tower and we talked about things and I think we had a very good conversation.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: So it's Trump meeting with Megyn Kelly who was attacking in very personal ways on Twitter all going back to the first debate. Indicate he is pivoting to a different kind of campaign style.PRZYBYLA: Yes because he's doing it in coordination with other things. He's not just meeting with Megyn Kelly. He was down for several days. He completely went off line and hired new people and perhaps most tellingly, he hasn't been bashing people on Twitter lately.So I think he's going into new phase and as much as he says trash in certain polls when they favor him, you know, he talks them up. So he is paying attention to these polls that show him really underwater with them and I think he's pivoting.KURTZ: And all this happens to coincide with Florida prosecutors declining to bring any charges against Corey Lewandowski for grabbing Michelle Fields, whatever you think of that incident, we've all looked at the videotape you know, a thousand times. It was a very big media story, maybe more than was warranted.BOOTHE: Yes. I think it probably got too much attention. Similarly how the meeting between Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly got way too many attention. I mean -- well, some reports sat down with candidates all of the time. They have sources. They connect with the sources. So I think that's you know, press loves conflict. This is something brewing that's been brewing for eight months in the making...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: I think it ordinarily -- it would even be news, sudden an anchor talks to a leading presidential candidate, yes.BOOTHE: Well, I -- I think the press to some degree led with emotion as opposed to objectivity in reviewing the incident that happened between Michelle Fields and Corey Lewandowski.Further, you know, I think that Trump's campaign handling of it. The inconsistencies are routed -- sort of added fuel to the fire. But it really should have let the prosecution play it out.Allow the State Attorney's office to do their job, investigate the case and obviously they're not moving forward with the prosecution. So hopeful the media will move on to some of the more pressing things facing this election cycle.KURTZ: You say the press should wait until the investigation is over. Let me know that next time that happens. Now Trump -- Donald Trump has also sat down with our Fox News colleague Houston Powers for her USA Today column and spoke to her for an hour. She has been very critical to him and her headline was Trump is kinder, gentler version.So was that an emerging story line now that Trump is toning it down or do you think he -- you think this is just a brief deviation from the norm?WILLIAMS: Well, his character is that he is aggressive and he will take risks in terms of what he says and what he does. So he's toning it down for the moment.I -- I would think that we are a little bit, you know, jumping the gun to say this is a new Donald Trump. We have to see what comes. By the way, on the Megyn Kelly front, I think she is the star of the moment in American media.And the idea that she is meeting with Donald Trump at her request suggests to me there is going to be fireworks in the media world when she and Donald Trump sit down to talk. I can imagine the ratings will blow the roof off this building.PRZYBYLA: I'm sure.KURTZ: But what are the reasons that she asked for the meeting was to see if she could get an interview and he has not agreed to that but she said stay tuned on that. All right, we also heard this week from Paul Ryan, house speaker, let's take a look and I've got a question on the other side.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS: Didn't he kind of say the same thing that is Paul Ryan about the speakership?UNKNOWN MALE: Does Paul Ryan want to be a speaker?REP. PAUL RYAN, U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SPEAKER: No, he doesn't.UNKNOWN MALE: Do you want to be speaker?RYAN: I'm not.UNKNOWN MALE: Why not?RYAN: That I don't want to be a speaker.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Well now he is a speaker. I didn't quite say that Paul Ryan had a televised news conference in which he said he will not, under any circumstances, accept a draft or a nomination as president because he didn't run for president.And -- but what Neil Cavuto did and a lot of others didn't say, well didn't he say the same thing? Why won't the press take note for an answer? Ryan has said this 18 or 19 times.PRZYBYLA: I know. I guess it just makes the story sexier and we're used to people saying no when they we know they have certain political ambitions. But he seems pretty darn, you know, unequivocal about this.And I think part of it is also because a lot of the people who are feeding the media are part of that republican establishment who really want to have this escape hatch option even if Paul Ryan isn't there and doesn't want it.KURTZ: We seem to love the fantasy football aspect of this. Well, he might run. If this doesn't happen on the third ballot, they may turn to so and so.WILLIAMS: Yes. So I come back to what you were talking about earlier. I was listening to the news, I said -- you know, voters really should be hearing about policy issues, instead, we're focused on all of the minutia and the in-fighting and the elbows being thrown.People love the horse race though, Howie, I mean really do. I think we in the media are overly preoccupied because we give people the impression the horse race is all that matters. But you're actually electing somebody who is going to have office and have power.KURTZ: Thank you for that reminder.BOOTHE: That's what's going on.KURTZ: Oh, yes.PRZYBYLA: Be careful.KURTZ: Ted Cruz has mostly been covered now in terms of the delegate fight that we talked about earlier and he's picking up in some states. What about the fact that he went on Jimmy Fallon, he appeared on CNN with his very young daughters? There seems to be a charm offensive going on after that Time Magazine cover saying he is likeable enough?BOOTHE: Well I think that's been similarly to Hillary Clinton. That's been a question about Ted Cruz, is he likeable or not. But I think that is a question that a lot of people have been asking. So I think Time Magazine was in balance with, you know, publishing that magazine piece, but as that being said, yes.I mean, I think Ted Cruz is working on winning people over. He has folks like Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney and some of the establishment types who are coming to his defense. So he's trying to build this broader coalition of republicans. So doing the CNN piece, doing the Jimmy Fallon allows for him to have a broader appeal. And the Jimmy Fallon interview was hilarious, so good for him.KURTZ: It was good. The establishment that didn't like Ted Cruz very much - - some of its members now embracing Ted Cruz. You can e-mail us at mediabuzz@foxnews.com. And up next, why is Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg ripping Donald Trump and could that lose him some friends? And later, Nina Totenberg who broke the Anita Hill story and whether the new HBO movie on the Clarence Thomas hearings plays it straight.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Mark Zuckerberg didn't mention Donald Trump by name at a tech conference, but there is no doubt who the Facebook founder had in mind.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK FOUNDER: I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as others, for blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, reducing trade. Instead of building walls, we can help people build bridges.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us now from San Francisco is Sarah Lacy, founder and editor of the tech site Pando.com. Sarah, is this the new more political Mark Zuckerberg trying to be more than a tech tycoon?SARAH LACY, PANDO.COM FOUNDER AND EDITOR: You know, everyone has been saying this was unprecedented and certainly I don't think it was expected at a developer conference. But Mark Zuckerberg has history of making very diplomatic political, very controlled political stances.He's been very pro-gay rights. They were one of the first companies to offer egg freezing and more reproductive rights for women as a perk of working there. And he's pledged $100 million of his own money to create Forwardus, a very, you know, pro and more empathetic inclusive immigration lobbying group.I think he's had a history of making these stances before that if you look at it, probably aren't core tenants of a Trump campaign. So to me, it was very diplomatic. He can blast him. He didn't name him. It's consistent with the things he stood for before.I think he got so much attention because Facebook not only controls one huge outlet, it has Facebook proper which a billion people are on and more people get their news from than anything else and three of the four largest messaging apps in the world and WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook messenger...KURTZ: It's a massive platform...LACY: And he's never gone this level of power...KURTZ: Donald Trump has 7 million followers on Facebook. But does Zuckerberg risk, whether you thought it was diplomatic or not, does he risk alienating some Facebook users who don't share his views on Donald Trump or immigration?LACY: There is always that risk that this is a man who has become very good at knowing what he is saying and the impact it will have. And he has many smart political advisors. There is a whole trend right now of tech companies becoming more political, not in the divisive sense but in terms of using the tools of politics and diplomacy and Mark is one of the leaders in that.That said, they are so cautious on this kind of stuff. I mean, you look at what Facebook just went through with India where it wanted to provide free internet access and it was mostly rebuked by the Indian people because there was a fear that they would be seen as the controlled view of the internet that was in Facebook's favor.The company is very, very sensitive about this. And I think it's important to say he has shown what he believes. But there is no evidence that Facebook has tipped the scales. And the reason they won't isn't because it's not within their rights, it's because Facebook does what is best in for Facebook and as a business, it's not best for them to try to control the outcome of the election.KURTZ: Right, to tweak the algorithms and decide what people -- influence what people see. I got half a minute, but one reason this made a lot of online headlines is there was an internal Facebook poll in which some employees asked, we don't know how many employees were involved -- what responsibility does Facebook have to prevent president Trump in 2017? So obviously people in the ranks don't like the Donald.LACY: Yes, it's absolutely true. And look, a lot of people said Facebook is essentially a media outlet like The New York Times. What you see in The New York Times has really been much stronger in warning against a Trump presidency.Facebook could do that. There is no evidence it will, even if its employees want it. Again, Mark has three constituencies, shareholders, employees, and his audience. And unfortunately, employees are the smallest of those three groups.KURTZ: Right. Sarah Lacy, thanks very much for your insight from San Francisco. We appreciate it.LACY: Thanks, Howie.KURTZ: When we come back, Nina Totenburg on this question, does the new HBO film about Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill engage in a bit of revision of history?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: It's been a quarter of a century since the Anita Hill hearings when her allegations came close to blocking the senate confirmation of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas. Last night, HBO debuted a film about those events called Confirmation.MSMBC and NBC have played up the movie featuring Anita Hill and the movie star and executive producer Kerry Washington who had met with her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANITA HILL, FORMER U.S. EEOC ASSISTANT / VICTIM OF CLARENCE THOMAS: She just wanted to know not only how I felt during the confirmation hearing, but what was I thinking? And that really was encouraging though to have someone wanting to know what was -- what was my thinking pattern? What was going on in my mind during this whole episode?UNKNOWN MALE: Others are saying this is political propaganda...KERRY WASHINGTON, ANITA HILL MOVIE ACTRESS: Sure.UNKNOWN MALE: To support Anita Hill and even support Hillary Clinton.WASHINGTON: For me, I've felt as like it's important for me to not hold back on my political beliefs because of what I do for a living.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining is now is Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio who broke the Anita Hill story back in 1991. You were asked to be in this movie. What did you say?NINA TOTENBERG, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO CORRESPONDENT: No.KURTZ: Why?TOTENBERG: I mean -- well, they wanted me to re-voice my story so they could have video of it. They wanted me to sort of reenact my interview with her and my first approach to her which first of all I couldn't do because I don't remember it that well and I don't have the notes from it anymore.But I said, no. That's put in news. We have rules against that because that's real news. So you know, I can't do that, I'm sorry. So they used a little bit of me, of the actual report. But we wouldn't let them edit it, either.KURTZ: Interesting. So some conservatives, others sensitive, others are saying the movie is inaccurate. Some scenes and dialogue are created and slanted to make Anita Hill look good. Even Anita hill says there are composite characters and some invented dialogue.TOTENBERG: Well, it's like all of these movies. It can't be completely accurate. It's compressing vast amounts of information in time into an hour and a half or two hours. I saw the movie once because I was curious enough to look at it. And I think actually it's -- to me, it was quite interesting.I thought that she come off telling a completely credible story but so does Clarence Thomas and I remember having that feeling. The villain in the piece is the judiciary committee.KURTZ: The senators don't look good and...TOTENBERG: They look awful.KURTZ: The panel chaired by Joe Biden.TOTENBERG: I mean, the republicans looked vicious, the democrats looked hapless and Biden looked at best weakened and worse, gutless.KURTZ: And does that reflect the tumultuous period that you chronicled?TOTENBERG: I think it is an accurate reflection, and I said this before. But to me, when I broke in story, to me the story was the judiciary committee had not looked into this on its own privately when it could have actually resolved this -- had a chance of resolving it.The minute slated hearings for three or four days later in the kind of atmosphere we were in, it was sealing the fate of the -- of the truthfulness of what this was all about and that we would never know what the real answer was.KURTZ: Now in the movie, Clarence Thomas is shown as shaken by the allegations, insisting to his wife it's not true. So it not completely one sided. But I can understand because the emotions of that time still run pretty high 25 years later where somebody would say, ""Well, this is the vehicle to make Anita Hill look better.""And of course Kerry Washington, I'm sure Clarence Thomas had no interest meeting with her but she did meet with Anita Hill.TOTENBERG: And the thing it was, you know, at the time was very minor, was much more major in the movie was the fact she took a lie detector test, a polygraph and passed it and he refused to. Now there is a perfectly good reason to refuse to. They're not entirely accurate.And, you know, there are plenty of important people like George Shultz refuse to take polygraphs when they want people in the state department to take them. It's a good reason to take them. But in that chance, the believability of her story is more so in the movie.KURTZ: Now, people forget that she initially didn't want to come forward. And you played a role in that because you found out about her and you got the copy of the affidavit to the senate committee and you called her and still have not revealed your source, even at least 25 years later.Obviously also you and another reporter who worked on the story had to deal with a leak investigation. Was there a reaction against you for disclosing these allegations by Anita Hill?TOTENBERG: Oh, it was awful. I mean, it was really dreadful. I have said this and, you know, you don't want to sound like a whiner. But everything you ever done in your life that wasn't perfect gets examined and held up and people screaming at you. They're preventing -- I mean, I left the Nightline Studio one night and Allen Simpson who is my friend since then, I made sure we made up.But Allen Simpson was screaming at me, not allowing the car to leave. I finally get out of the car. I yell back at him. We get and go around the corner and the driver stops. He says to me, ""Lady, you better get a gun.""KURTZ: So it was not the most pleasant period of your life.TOTENBERG: No, very awful. It was dreadful...KURTZ: And once you gave -- you broke the story. You weren't saying the allegations are true. You were saying here is the affidavit and asked what she says.TOTENBERG: Yes.KURTZ: Nina Totenberg, great to see you. Thanks very much for coming in this Sunday.TOTENBERG: Thank you for having me.KURTZ: Coming up with Bernie Sanders drawing massive crowds and riding a wave of momentum. Is the press starting to view Hillary Clinton as the damaged candidate? And later, when columnists savage Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, is there a line between commentary and shear partisanship?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: If anyone in the media delivered anger and hatred to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sander that vanished at the CNN debate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DANA BASH, CNN: Can you name one decision she made as senator that shows she favored banks because of the money she received?SANDERS: The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street brought this country into the worst economic down turn since the great recession, great depression of the 30's. Now Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman sacs for $225,000 at stakes.CLINTON: Well, you can tell -- yes, he cannot come up with any example because there is no example.SANDERS: Secretary Clinton called them out. Oh, my goodness. They must have been really crushed by this.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: It's called dripping with disdain. We're back with the panel and Heidi, I thought the CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash did a good job. Were they encouraging conflict at that debate or Hillary and Bernie going to go at it no matter what?PRZYBYLA: I think they did a great job about making it about the candidates and they stepped back. I think the moment was primed for this before we even went into this debate.We were all reporting how Hillary's strategy is now to go for the kill and then worry about unity later. And I think that this was a reflection of that, but also Bernie's irritation on his side as well.KURTZ: Lisa, I have a question already for you and I'm going to pause for a moment because it's kind of reflected in the ""Saturday Night Live"" skit last night featuring Larry David and Julie Louis-Dreyfus. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JULIE LOUIS-DREYFUS, ACTRESS: You've been pretty vague in the past, how exactly are you going to break up the big banks?SANDERS: Once I'm elected president, I'll have a nice Schmitz (sic) in the Whitehouse gym then I'll go to the big banks. I'll sit them down and yada, yada, yada, they'll be broken up.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: So when ""SNL ""went after Trump, liked talked about whether this was a sort of a cultural barometer. Does this now reflect a view that Bernie Sanders has great rhetoric? And he's done frankly well in this campaign, but he doesn't really have the details to back up some of the proposals.BOOTHE: Well yes, that's been the knock against him. And he had that horrible -- I believe it's the New York Daily News editorial where he really couldn't back his policies that he was putting forth. Yes, I think after the CNN debate -- look, the secret is out. Bernie sanders and Hillary Clinton do not like each other.KURTZ: It wasn't that much of a secret.BOOTHE: Well, it's known for sure now. But you could just see the frustration with Hillary Clinton. It's palatable the fact that she can't put this to bed. She can't put this campaign now behind her and just be the nominee.KURTZ: When Hillary Clinton was in a skit with Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. It's called the Inner Circle, it's like the -- other correspondents say the Gridiron Club here in D.C. He made a joke about colored people time, she went along and blamed him. Press made a big deal out of it. Is it a big deal?WILLIAMS: Not to me, as a black person I say this. I mean, that is like something people say to each other all the time. What struck me was there are so many colleagues said they never heard of it...PRZYBYLA: I never heard of it.WILLIAMS: And they've said colored people. Isn't that offensive? And I said, ""Well it's anachronistic but I don't know if it's offensive because black people say that to each other all the time much it's like someone saying manana down in Latin America.You know, oh yes, you guys are -- a manana type. So but anyway I think it was dangerous for Hillary Clinton. We're just talking about Bernie Sanders and why that acrimony has some consequence and why the media should focus on it. Hillary needs Bernie's supporters going forward.KURTZ: Let the record show that Juan showed up on time for this segment. All right, you know, Bernie is drawing these massive crowds, 30,000, 40,000 per month, he even reported that. But when he goes to lower Manhattan, Greenwich Village and there are 27,000 people near NYU, the New York press was like, ""Wow this guy is for real."" It doesn't happen to...PRZYBYLA: Maybe they haven't been out there. At every -- in every state including states he's won and states he's lost, it's kind of been the same. He has huge crowds and the reason why, Howie, and maybe this has been a little bit under covered, is that people have organized ahead of Bernie Sanders.We were all surprised by what happened in Iowa. That's because people were on the ground organizing before Bernie ever got there and that's why it's been the same throughout the country.KURTZ: So Bernie Sanders took 48 hours off the campaign trail to go to the Vatican and speak at a panel and then he got -- he says five minute audience with the pope -- to Pope Francis. He said it was just a hand shake and he was being polite.And anybody who reads those things does need a psychiatrist, the pope says. But the way it was covered was sort of like this was a really weird thing. The only Jewish candidate race was going to the Vatican. Was that fair?BOOTHE: Well, I think it is a really weird thing because look, he's got the New York primary right around the corner. He is taking time off to give a speech at the Vatican. He makes the big deal about the pope. The pope is saying, ""Look, I gave him two seconds of my time. I literally shook his hand, nothing to see here."" And Bernie Sanders is singing praises and trying to make it seem like this huge deal that he's there...KURTZ: There are Catholic voters -- Catholic voters in New York.BOOTHE: I know, but you don't take time off right before a primary to make that kind of trip in my opinion. So I think the way -- that the reason why they covered it in such a weird degree is because it was weird.WILLIAMS: You know what, I just want to jump in here. I think you touched on something so fascinating to me many terms of the press conference or lack of the coverage in the fact Bernie Sanders is Jewish. He is setting record -- nobody, no Jewish candidate has ever gone to this level of American public elected life...KURTZ: It is rarely talked about it and...WILLIAMS: Very rarely.KURTZ: He doesn't talk about that much. But there was a Cnn.com story won. The headline was The Book of Bernie: What religion is Sanders. And the story said -- he says religion is a guiding principle in his life but also he's not particularly religious or a member of any synagogue. So what? I mean, a lot of people are in...WILLIAMS: Correct. And in fact, an increasing number in this generation say that they're nondenominational. But Bernie, it's not that he is somehow advocating the fact that he's Jewish. He is simply saying, it is not defining him. And it's so interesting.Did he not speak at APEC in that debate that we just played. He goes after Israel in terms of his defense, and now he's off to the Vatican. I think he is presenting as a different sort of nonreligious, nondenominational presence of opinion.KURTZ: I think all of these -- we'll be getting a lot more coverage if the media believe that Bernie Sanders really had a shot at the democratic nominee.Juan Williams, Lisa Boothe, Heidi Przybyla. Thanks very much for a great discussion. Next on Media Buzz, Ron Fournier on how far columnists can and should go in savaging candidates they don't like? And later, New York's Daily News and New York Post at war again, this time over Donald Trump.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: How far should commentators go in utterly denouncing candidates they don't like? I put that question to Ron Fournier, a columnist of The Atlantic and author of a new book about his relationship with this son, Love that boy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Ron Fournier, welcome.RON FOURNIER, THE ATLANTIC COLUMNIST AND AUTHOR: Thanks for having me, Howie.KURTZ: You're a columnist. You're paid for your opinions. But let's talk about how far is too far? You've said Donald Trump social media whore, a boar, a bully who traffics in all hates by new technologies, bigoted sexist divisive, being glorious fan of political violence. It sounds like you're running an opposition pack.FOURNIER: Normal opinion as a columnist and those are my opinions. You know, I could be a little more careful and maybe say what he is saying is sexist. What he is saying is bigoted. What he is doing is vacuous, his lack of policy shows he is vacuous and ignorant.You know, I could copy a little bit maybe, but all of those things are -- are now, not only are -- my opinions but I think they're backed up by facts.KURTZ: Hillary Clinton who you covered back in Arkansas, you've known her a long time from firings in the courthouse travel office in '93 to e-mail scandal of today. Clinton has a history of deflections, deception and untruth. So you have written a lot about whether she lies. It sounds from these kinds of sentences like you can't stand her.FOURNIER: Actually, I really like Hillary Clinton. I've known her for a long time. I think -- I've always said and I've told you this, if I could have a drink with either Clinton, it would be hands down Hillary Clinton. I think she's a fine person, I think she's qualified to be president.I think what she did with the e-mail issue, if everyone did it, if she was allowed to make this precedent, there would be no freedom of information act, there would be no legislative oversight anywhere in this country, there would be no historical record and would be constantly jeopardizing U.S. Secrets.And if we allow a politician to do that without accountability and to deceive us about it, that's setting a terrible president. As reporters, and even as -- especially as columnists, it's our job to say, ""Hey, what you're doing, Donald Trump, that is sexist the way you treated of Megyn Kelly and what you're doing, Hillary Clinton, that is deceptive as the way you are treating the American public...KURTZ: You do give it to both sides. But when you use this kind of strident colorful language, it is also a view breaking throughout the noise and getting some attention for what you write?FOURNIER: I don't think of it that way. But if you remember when I worked at the AP for years which is a great institution, the oldest, largest news organization in the world. One thing the boss there or the executive editor Kathleen Carroll tried to get me to do to the kind of lead the way in the rest of AP was to get away from what she called weasel words.When we know a governor has done something wrong, instead of saying critics say what the governor has done is wrong. If factually what he's done is wrong, we should just say the governor is wrong. That we shouldn't always - - we shouldn't have false equivalence.She wanted to teach the rest of the AP and she wanted me to kind of lead the way with my columns. Don't pretend that there's always one hand on the other hand and that they're equal. Call out people when at the do wrong. Use clear, concise and in some cases, use provocative language if that's what gets your point across. And so I was taught to do that and I'm proud of what I've done.KURTZ: In your book, you talk about your son Tyler...FOURNIER: Yes sir.KURTZ: Who has Asperger's and I'm a dad. I wrestle with this. Lots of dads wrestle with this. You missed a lot of family life because you were going around the country covering stories that seemed very, very important at the time. Do you feel at times you weren't there for him?FOURNIER: Yes. What parent doesn't? For me, I think there is an extra shame and I write about it in Love that Boy because I had choices. There are a lot of parents who are working two, three jobs and can't be home with their kids. I could have been home more.It was important to my family and it was a decision my wife and I made that I take this path, that I leave Arkansas and cover the Whitehouse and cover the campaigns. But every day you make choices in your life. And there are too often than that where I could choose between work or home, I chose work.KURTZ: You tell the story about the book about how on 9/11, you basically hung up on your wife Lorie because you had to get back to work. She is home with the three kids and later tells you, you know, I don't have much adult contact, raising our children and you don't want to talk about your work because you've been doing that all day.FOURNIER: I haven't talked about that story since I wrote it. Yes. On 9/11, she called right after I broke the news that these were planes were hijacked. And I said, ""I got to go, I can't talk you"" because I was too busy telling the rest of the world. I wouldn't tell my wife what was happening. I didn't even ask her, ""What are you doing with the three kids that are in school?""And that got us -- when I realize what I had done to her, was when I started writing this book that one of the first things I did is took a tape recorder to one of our date nights. I interviewed her and it was interesting how just dispassionate I was able to be and then interviewing her.But then when I sat down and listened to what she said to write the book and I listened for the first time in my life in that tape recording that by then was a couple weeks ago. It really blew my mind because I heard many I wife saying to me that, you know, ""You didn't want to talk about 9/11 because you were busy. You didn't want to talk about work for years when you were home. But I want to talk about it. Why didn't you listen to me?""KURTZ: Back to your son and you described how he got meetings with Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and how gracious they were. You missed the symptoms of Asperger's originally. You wanted him to be popular. You pushed him into playing sports. You were pretty hard on yourself in this book.FOURNIER: Yes, and it's not an exercise of, you know, I know I can't get forgiveness or have solutions just by doing this. It's not like me talking to a priest. But I think it's important. If nothing else -- if parents can get out of this book that, ""Hey, you're not alone"" because I do recognize we all carry some guilt.And none of us are perfect parents. I'm certainly not an expert. I wasn't when I was 23 and first had a child and I'm certainly now at almost 53. But I did go through a couple years, thanks to my wife of looking at myself really hard and trying to be honest with myself. And I'm hoping that maybe I can help somebody, especially dads who keep this all inside.You know, to deal with, you know, if you feel guilty about something, see what can you do to be better it.KURTZ: Hard book to write and fascinating book to read. Ron Fournier.FOURNIER: Thank you.KURTZ: All right. Thanks very much.FOURNIER: I love doing your show.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: After the break, Ed Henry on that Donald Trump meeting the press again today after losing last night in Wyoming. Are journalists buying his message about a corrupt system?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Donald Trump meeting with reporters and accepting endorsements on Staten Island, New York's most republican burrow today. And Joining us now is Ed Henry, Fox's Chief Whitehouse correspondent who covers the Hillary Clinton campaign.ED HENRY, FOX'S CHIEF WHITEHOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good to see you.KURTZ: Good to see you, Ed. So yesterday you were sitting at Fox and friends. You got to ask Trump a question during one of his call-ins and let's take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HENRY: Why not leave the Republican Party and run as an independent? You're saying the party has rigged it? So why are you still running as a republican?TRUMP: Because I'm leading by far and I'm the number, you know, person in the -- and I'd rather do it as a republican. I am a republican. I'd rather clean up the system so that for the future, we can have a much fairer system.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Now, are you expecting him to suddenly make news and say, ""You are right, I think I may just leave the Republican Party.""HENRY: It's more impressing. You know, what's interesting is when you do these interviews and they say I cover the democrats. I don't usually get a chance to press him. I hear all kinds of people, social media, commentary elsewhere saying these folks never press him, just let him talk and I thought that would be one area.That wasn't a perfect question but the idea being he keeps saying, and was insisting lying Ted Cruz. He said that again and again, and he was saying that the Republican Party has rigged this and that they're corrupt.Seems like a natural question to say, why in the world are you still in the republican if you think the number two guy is a liar and the RNC chairman and others are rigging this against you? And it was a reasonable answer though. I think for him to say, ""I'm going to stay within the system and try to fix it whether he...KURTZ: Because I'm leading by a lot.HENRY: Right, and that's the way he likes to spend it.KURTZ: So you spend most of your time now on the road with the Hillary Clinton campaign. How many opportunities do you have to ask her a question? Has she held any kind of other than a brief...HENRY: She's got a handful of press availabilities here and there. A lot of times we're told about them at the last possible moment. One recent one was in the Bronx. I had just been in New York, left to go to Pennsylvania for another campaign of what they're trying to keep up in case.She went back to New York and went outside Yankee Stadium. I mean, I could -- who would have loved to have been there by the way if I got a heads up, I didn't. And just the small pools of reporters around her were told about it and then she...KURTZ: Is she paying the price for this not -- not the answered questions but it's hard to find out...HENRY: We'll see. I mean look, she's still winning and that's their strategy to get the nomination.KURTZ: Right, not to please the press.HENRY: I've tried to be fair to both candidates and in the case of Bernie Sanders say people were dismissing him all along. And I've tried to be fair and say give this guy a shot in the sense that he has a real candidacy here.We should cover him, tough but fair like Hillary Clinton. And by the way, when he is not winning, we she shouldn't be pro up his candidacy. We shouldn't be cheerleading for either. We should say, can you really win this thing?For example, a couple of days ago at that Brooklyn debate, before the debate is obvious the strategists were telling us, ""We think he's going to have a great May."" And Meyers put up something he will -- and the press and they said, ""Well, are you not going to win New York?"" Oh we'll see.Hang on a second. You know, we press Hillary Clinton when we can. If you're not going to win New York and all those delegates, don't tell me about a good May. You have got to win in April.KURTZ: I got a half a minute, but -- so Bernie say's she's a tool of Wall Street. Hillary says he can't go into one instance of favoring back. Do you think there has been good reporting on the details of their political agreements?HENRY: It took a while frankly...KURTZ: Just the back and forth he said.HENRY: Mostly been the back and forth. And I think to myself and many people are probably guilty of that. And we do the horse race, we do what's going on today. But I do think, you mentioned this before, the Daily News Editorial Board did a good job and I think it was a turning point in pressing Bernie Sanders on the details and he struggled with that.KURTZ: And Henry, great to see you. Thanks for that behind the scenes look at covering the Hillary campaign. Still to come, a new tabloid war in New York over Donald Trump, and the candidates showcasing their spouses and kids on the air. How much does that really help?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: How much do the New York's tabloids despise each other? On the same day that Rupert Murdoch's New York post Donald Trump's go-to paper endorsed him. The Daily News attacked its rival over the retirement of Post editor and chief Col Allan and look at this, Tata to Trump's Tabloid Toady.The news story about the so-called belligerent boss includes blind quotes from staffers criticizing Allan. Now keep in mind that Mark Zuckerman's daily news keeps ripping Trump on his covers, Clown Runs for President and Dead Clown Walking which aren't just absurdly bias, it turned out to be just plain wrong.All right, presidential candidates have always showcased their families. But this week, they are all over the air waves casting their husband or dad in a softer light.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)IVANKA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER: I think the way he raised me and the way he raised Tiffany, it's a testament to the fact that he believes in inspiring women and empowering women. He always taught me there wasn't anything I couldn't do.TED CRUZ, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Because I was back for Caroline's daddy-daughter picnic at school which featured all the dads running and playing games and...CAROLINE CRUZ, TED CRUZ'S DAUGHTER: My favorite.CRUZ: Your favorite was -- that she got to dress up daddy in like this pink boa these like big goofy looking underwear.JANE SANDERS, BERNIE SANDER'S WIFE: In the first time at the victory party, he asked me to dance and that was the end. To me, it was like the beginning of everything.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Those Cruz's daughters are cute. And The New York Times has a profile today of Ivanka Trump and her very positive piece about her role in Trump Campaign. Now look, we all know this is designed to humanize the politician making them seem more like, well, ordinary human beings.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle, along with Geraldo Rivera, Eric Bolling, Meghan McCain, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Some of the GOP candidates are still seething about Wednesday night's grossly biased debate on CNBC, saying they are prepared to take action.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE HUCKABEE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Be ready to hear that the campaigns are going to not allow the networks to control this process, to marginalize the very candidates. I think there's going to be some pretty bold expressions from the joint campaigns that will be coming very soon.BEN CARSON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've asked my staff to reach out to all the staffs of all the other candidates, and let's talk about a different type of format.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Did the RNC just attempt to get ahead of them? The committee has pulled out of the upcoming NBC debate scheduled for February 26th. In a letter to the network, Chairman Reince Priebus writes, the CNBC debate was conducted in bad faith. We need to insure there's not a repeat performance. NBC responded with a statement calling it as a disappointing development. However, along with our debate broadcast partners at Telemundo, we will work in good faith to resolve this matter with the Republican Party. The moderators on Wednesday night were widely criticized for their outrageous line of questioning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GERALDO RIVERA, CO-HOST: It was outrageous.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, it was outrageous. But, you know what, this has been a pretty rapid turn of events. Because what you have is outrage immediately on social media. You have all the candidates coming out talking afterwards from the debate saying they didn't feel they were treated properly. This was supposed to be about the economy, what's going on in country. And instead, you didn't see any probing pertinent questions in that regard. Then you have the RNC taking a lot of heat and flack from the candidates, who feel they didn't support them, that they didn't properly vet this debate or the moderators in the line of questioning. This is the fallout and a spin.RIVERA: I think first of all, NBC is not yet out of that February debate. They say they have suspended the debate. They haven't said they canceled the debate. NBC cleverly pulls in Telemundo. Because remember, this debate will be held in Houston, in the heart of Hispanic America.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.RIVERA: And it is inconceivable to me that the RNC, or the Republican candidates will refuse to debate when one of the key issues in the entire race, immigration, impacts so profoundly the population that I'm describing. So I think that they will come to some compromise. But I totally agree that the questioning was outrageously biased. I think that the first question, which should have been the opening remarks from the various candidates that was agreed. Instead they asked, what was the lamest thing that ever happened to you?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: What's your greatest weakness?(CROSSTALK) GUILFOYLE: But I also see some conservative Latino groups coming out to support NBC, because of the connection to Telemundo. So everybody is kind of like doing a little bit of the taking sides, Bolling.BOLLING: So there are a bunch of Republican debates, and to Reince Priebus' credit, he spread them around. CNN got some, Fox got some, business networks got some, NBC, mainstream media got them. Look at the sides, there are six debates, where's the Fox debate? There's a CNN debate, there's a PBS debate, there's a Univision debate.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: There's no Fox debate. So on the DNC side, they said Fox isn't going to get one of our debates. But on the Republican side, they said, you know what, we're going to let everyone see it. All the audience is going to see it. I think it was a good idea. However, understanding that, they can still put some restrictions. CNBC says we are going to focus on money, the economy, the debt, things like that. Force them to say are you sure you're going to do it? Not asking them for what their questions are, or direct them to ask a certain thing. But force them into the corner and say, this is the area we're going to go. And when they don't, like they failed to do on Wednesday night, then you punish them the way they're going to allegedly punish. I do think -- I agree with Geraldo. I think there will be an NBC debate on February 26th. This is the RNC's way of saying hey, enough of this crap. The next time do you this, there's no more debate for your network.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. They have to take a stand.MEGHAN MCCAIN, CO-HOST: I think it's not too much to ask to vet these moderators. I have seen more debates than I can possibly remember in my lifetime. This debate -- the CNBC debate will be studied in political science classes of what exactly not to do, and how you bring your personal biases and personal politics into a presidential debate. I completely agree with Reince Priebus until everyone else can have a fair debate and not bring in their liberal media biases and berate the candidates -- when I was watching it I was thinking if my father was up there, I would have stormed the stage. It was so disrespectful, so rude, so biased. I have no problems with what's happening. There has to be some ground rules.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. There has to be some repercussions. Could you imagine, Greg, if this was the Democratic debate and you know, you have Hillary Clinton on to be outraged, saying it's sexist, it's inappropriate, it's a war on women, you're not taking it seriously. The Republicans are acting like oh, this is a joke and they're making a mockery of it.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well, you know, Reince did this once before in August 13th. He threatened CNN and I think CNBC because of their Hillary Clinton documentary. In this case, it's Reince and repeat. Anyway, but this is nuts. Who did this (inaudible) benefit most? Why did the candidates want it to stop? That debate benefited the candidate. Because there's nothing better than going after the media.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: But I don't care about that. I care about the candidates. If you're going to be David and Goliath, you want -- you want to be David. And the candidates were placed in that position where the media became Goliath. And meanwhile, CNBC, the debate is like dog poop on their shoes that they can't scrape off. They were smeared with it. I think you know what, if you get a biased panel.RIVERA: That's a vivid metaphor.GUILFOYLE: Thank you very much. I have more of them in my vivid metaphor booklet. If you ever get in a position where you're David and Goliath with the media, embrace it. America loves it.BOLLING: They also gave the ones that aren't Donald Trump or Ben Carson, another Goliath.GUTFELD: Right.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And that was to give them more talking time. So if you look, the ones that had the biggest problem with it were the leaders. The ones that had the least amount of problems with the CNBC debate were the ones who got to stand up. Ted Cruz.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: I thought he was the sharpest in terms of his criticism. The way he phrased it, he repeated the four silly questions that preceded his. I thought he had a good memory and took the legs out from under the moderator.MCCAIN: But ultimately, America deserves better than that. I was actually looking forward to.(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: No, it's not. We should know the difference between each candidate and their opinions, the future of America and the economy. I sat there two hours of basically a clown show because these amateur moderators couldn't do their research. Americans deserve better than that.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: But that's not exciting.GUILFOYLE: Fox Business Network, we'll show them how it's done.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: All right. Now, to some other 2016 news, after failing to deliver a strong performance Wednesday night's debate, Jeb Bush acknowledges to donors he needs to step up his game. But he denies his campaign has plunged in a death spiral.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEB BUSH, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not on life support. We have the most money, we have the greatest organization. We're doing fine. Look, in October -- late October of four years ago, Herman Cain was the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. Eight years ago, Hillary Clinton was up by 26 points against an unknown state senator named Barack Obama. Every one of these elections goes through a process.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All true. Anything can happen. But.RIVERA: Talk about a guy who got spanked. Jeb Bush went after Marco Rubio for Marco Rubio -- Senator Rubio's absence from the Senate, and I think that's an absolutely legitimate issue. Marco Rubio was primed, ready for the attack.GUILFOYLE: And why is that?RIVERA: He turned it back. He said you never raised it when John McCain - - with all due respect to Senator McCain was running. You never raised that issue. Why are you raising it now? You're only raising it because your handlers have told you it's an effective way to attack me and I'm beating you.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: But he knew that was coming, you knew that, right.RIVERA: It emasculated Jeb Bush. I think Jeb Bush is beyond life support. I don't care if he has $100 million in the bank. He is not going to buy the popularity vote.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: By the way, you don't want it put your name in the same sentence as life support. I mean, you shouldn't have said that.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It's worse than being linked to Hep C or Russell Brand. It doesn't work. When you say my candidacy is not on life support, you are saying my candidacy is on life support. He's coming off so stiff. He makes Queen Elizabeth look like Gumby. He needs to show America that it's more than just money that he has. Because he has money, but he hasn't shown that.BOLLING: Maybe he doesn't.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Maybe that's all he has.GUILFOYLE: That's not true.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: He clearly doesn't have the personality that his brother has. He clearly doesn't have the ability to campaign like some of the other Republicans have. He has a lot of money.GUTFELD: But he also has a resume.BOLLING: He has a resume.GUTFELD: He was a good governor of a large state.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Here's the thing, you know what matters a lot right now? Less the resume and how you present your resume.(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: Can I say something here? As the only person that's been on a campaign that imploded and came back from the dead -- as the one person on this panel that has, what he needs to do, he needs to clean house with his staff. Because there are a lot of people in politics that.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It's their fault? It's not their fault.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Eric, she actually has some inside information we were talking about.(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: I'm saying that people in politics, they only care about being in a book on game change and hanging out with people and will sell out their candidates. I know this better than anyone else. Yes, Jeb Bush's messaging is completely off. He's a bad candidate and a bad campaigner. But I also believe he has bad people around him. And I think if he cleaned house and found people that believed in him, I'm living proof, I was there. That can turn around the campaign.GUILFOYLE: And you're saying -- you told me, they were some of the same people that were on your father's campaign?MCCAIN: Yes.(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: I don't understand why you're being so rude. I'm saying new blood on a campaign trail.BOLLING: I'm being rude? I'm making a point about Jeb Bush. I'm not talking about your father. I'm talking about Jeb Bush. Everyone is looking for a blame on the bottom-line, the guy is a bad candidate.GUTFELD: We're in a sad place where a good governor of a large state is a bad candidate because he's not glib enough and because he doesn't look well.GUILFOYLE: Right. But guess what, the point is experience and ability should matter because how many years ago was everybody complaining that Barack Obama was somebody who could talk the talk and look the part, but didn't have the goods to back it up? I'm saying yes. In this day and age, you have to have the experience, you have to have the gravitas to be able to carry the day.BOLLING: So you don't like Ben Carson then?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: You've been sitting here on the show, right? How many times do I talk about Ben Carson?BOLLING: Yeah, you like him.GUILFOYLE: No, I'm saying as Americans voting in the booth, there should be more.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: What about charisma? What about charisma? You have to want somebody to be in the room and hang out with you.MCCAIN: And meat-and-potatoes campaign, and go out in Town Halls, convince the New Hampshire voters, convince Iowa voters. It is possible.(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: Jeb Bush is not going to do OK in New Hampshire. Campaigning like that and these kinds of statements, he's not. I spent a significant portion of my life on campaign trail, I know how voters react, yes, Jeb Bush has a messaging problem. But I still believe he has a staffing problem.GUILFOYLE: So you're saying, there's additional problem. And you're right. You can't have people that aren't winners on your campaign. And you can't have people that are leaking stuff to the press and trying to undermine you. There is a reason like who leaked that? The Jeb Bush blueprint to drudge and U.S. News and World Report, it's outrageous.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: You bring up charisma. I think it's very important because President Obama was persuasively correct on the candidate when he was running for president, even though he didn't have a resume. However, think about some of the leaders we've had in the past and how they could never be president, whether it's Calvin Coolidge.RIVERA: Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: They are leaders who couldn't be elected now. Abe Lincoln couldn't be elected now.GUILFOYLE: True.(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: You're only as good as your last tweet.RIVERA: Donald Trump won the debate. I know there are all the pundits and specialists are all saying well Cruz and Rubio, et cetera. You had the drudge survey, you had Time Magazine survey, CNBC's own post-debate survey. Trump won it unbelievably, won it 2-1 over the nearest, he was in the high 40s. The nearest other candidate in the lower 20s.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Do you honestly think Trump won the debate?RIVERA: I honestly think that Trump and Carson will set the rules now?BOLLING: Do you think he won the debate?(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: I think it was a nonevent for Trump. From my point of view, it was neither negative nor positive.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Ted Cruz did a great job, did he not?RIVERA: I think Ted Cruz did a great job.MCCAIN: There are still eight more debates.BOLLING: And Rubio did well.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Are there eight?(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: These were magnificent numbers for a network that gets 200,000 people watching.(CROSSTALK)RIVEAR: They beat the World Series.GUILFOYLE: Because it is interesting and as Donald Trump will tell you, he was up on the stage.RIVERA: But without Donald Trump and Ben Carson, there is no show. I heard Governor Huckabee saying we're all going to get together. By all getting together, what you really mean is that Carson and Trump have to get together to set the rules. Because the other guys.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I would miss Rubio.RIVERA: Why Rubio?GUTFELD: Rubio has the boyish good looks.GUTFELD: You've grown quite fond of him.GUTFELD: Well, actually, he was the only one that went after Hillary persuasively.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: And had an articulate.GUILFOYLE: Carly did a little bit.GUTFELD: Yeah, but his was an assault on her incompetence and corruption, which was necessary.GUILFOYLE: I think this is laid the stage. No joke. That this debate on Fox Business Network is going to be fantastic. Because now the whole focus is going to be on it, let's see how this is done differently, comparatively between the two, that other business channel.MCCAIN: And people who actually know a little bit about politics will be hosting it, which will be a nice change.GUILFOYLE: And money.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: If you didn't have FBN, demand it.GUILFOYLE: Demand it.MCCAIN: All right. That was enough.GUILFOYLE: Coming up on The Five, a special Halloween edition of Facebook Friday -- oh, Greg. Post your questions for us now on facebook.com/thefivefncAlso ahead, the Fastest Seven with Bolling.But first, U.S. troops are now being deployed to Syria to fight ISIS, even though the president had pledged no boots on the ground. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RIVERA: You remember when facing mounting civilian casualties from the endless Syrian civil war in 2013, the president announced the beginning of U.S. military action there in Syria. President Obama promised at the time as you recall that there would be no U.S. ground troops involved.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Many of you have asked, won't this put us on a slippery slope to another war? My answer is simple. I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria.(END VIDEO CLIP)RIVERA: Today, the White House announcing that there will soon be U.S. boots on the ground worn by some of our best, special operations, but fewer than 50 of them are being deployed to Syria officially to advise and assist the good rebels fighting ISIS. Here's how Spokesman Josh Earnest explained the apparent reversal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE SPOKERSPERSON: In September of 2013, the president was receiving questions about what the United States was prepared to do, giving our insistence that President Bashar al-Assad had to go (inaudible). And the president was making the point that he was not prepared to put boots on the ground to take down the Assad regime. Again, that's precisely the mistake that the previous administration made, the quote that you pulled there is a very different situation.(END VIDEO CLIP)RIVERA: Different situation, same country. My issue is not so much that the president is reversing his position, which he clearly is despite what Josh Earnest just said. My issue is whether 50 of even the world's best fighters is too few and too late. Meghan.MCCAIN: I agree. President Obama has absolutely no strategy. He's still -- one thing that Hillary Clinton and General Petraeus have said that we need to start having no fly zones, which I agree with. So Bashar al-Assad can stop barrel-bombing his people. If anyone knows President Obama's foreign policy plan and can explain it to me, should have them on the show. Because I don't understand it.RIVERA: But you know, Eric, in the surge, 2006, we had 150,000 troops on the ground. We were losing until we managed to convince the Sunnis to fight against the Sunni al-Qaeda. There is no meaningful or effective or efficient move right now to turn Sunni Syrians into pro-western -- you know, what I mean? There's no one to fight ISIS in the Sunni space.BOLLING: I'm trying to figure out what this is. I mean, is this 50, that's going to become 50,000 soon?RIVERA: Should it? Should it?BOLLING: No, I don't think it will. I think President Obama -- yes, he reversed something he said he wasn't going to do, that's fine. War changes, life changes, the situations change. However, what are the Russians looking at right now? You're Putin, you're sending fires, you're killing ISIS, you're dropping bombs all over Syria. You're in negotiations at how you're going to fix your side and the other side allegedly, the anti-Bashar al-Assad side.RIVERA: I get it.BOLLING: Anti-ISIS, but also anti-Bashar al-Assad side says we're going to send 50 fighters. I mean, they must be laughing. Putin must be laughing at the Obama administration, no strategy, no idea what he's doing and no chance of succeeding.RIVERA: Kimberly, think we should work hand in hand with the Russians to beat ISIS. ISIS cut our guys' heads off.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: I want to you bomb from this parallel up. I want to bomb from this parallel down. I want to pound ISIS. I want to recruit Sunnis, if you can. But if you can't, still punish this extremist group that wants to kill us.MCCAIN: Don't you think Putin is teaming up with Bashar al-Assad right now?BOLLING: That's OK with me. Bashar al-Assad is the lesser of the two evils between Bashar al-Assad, the Shiite leader in Damascus and ISIS, the Sunni Extremist. I'll take Assad any day.GUILFOYLE: The problem is we're in this position now of having to be subservient. Wow, the U.S. subservient to Russia and now, we're going to ask Papa Putin if we can get back and play in our house, in our theater. And this is the problem. Because we've already made such a tremendous investment in all of these different areas. Now, it's become oh, wait a second, is the Obama administration being dishonest? Well, they haven't had any kind of strategy to begin with. So this is what happens, right? Because power forms (ph) a vacuum. Now, we've got Putin in play. Listen, I don't quarrel with the president continuing by the way to have special ops and Special Forces on the ground. But guess what, we've been doing that in Iraq. We just don't telegraph and broadcast it.RIVERA: Greg, I love the video of that raid, seeing those guys, I lament the loss of our hero, the special operator who fell. But I love seeing 70 people who are about to get their heads cut off being freed by our guys. I like that. I want ISIS to look up in the sky every minute wondering when they're going to get wasted. I want them to look in every corner, wondering when our special operations sniper will take them out.GUTFELD: I mean, it's a good point. That guy was a hero dying what he did best, rescuing 70 people. What's worse than passivism to me is ambivalent and inaction.RIVERA: Amen.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: President Obama has a handle-it complex. He is showing up at the end credits of the movie, instead of getting there the start. You can't dip in the pool in it -- dip your toe in the pool.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Thank you for correcting me.RIVERA: I thought that was one of your weird metaphors.GUTFELD: It might be. It could be the drugs.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: You could start the segment with the grateful dead.GUTFELD: That's true. There is the risk that ISIS -- when ISIS gets their hands on one of us, then -- then we're going to be faced with this, we're going to have to be prepared to annihilate, completely annihilate the enemy. We have to accept that, we can't just dip our toe in the pool. And if they happen to grab one of our guys, and it gets ugly, we can't back down, we have do say you're gone and nuke the hell out of them.RIVERA: I hate that a terrorist organization actually occupies that territory.GUILFOYLE: Unbelievable.RIVERA: Including the city of Mosul.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.MCCAIN: The other thing that's lost is this is the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War II. Four million people displaced, 250,000 people have been killed. We're totally losing sight of that right now as well.RIVERA: I agree. I agree with you.GUILFOYLE: It's a very important point.RIVERA: Ahead, what to know.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: I want to know about Kanye West. Is Kanye West really running for president. What does George W. Bush think about that? That's coming up next in the Fastest Seven.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back. Time for the Fastest Seven Minutes on television. Three spicy stories, seven speedy minutes, one sprinkley host. First up, a force you don't want to reckon with are the cops. And Quentin Tarantino is learning it the hard way. Police unions in major cities across the country are calling for a boycott of Tarantino's films, including the LAPD. Here's the report.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We called the action the police departments across the country from the east coast to the west coast, to boycott any movie that he's in or he's a producer in. I know in the City of Los Angeles, if he does a movie here, he has to get permission from the Los Angeles Police Commission. If he is in town, I'm going do make sure I'm going to try to get that denied.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: What was -- I mean, this is a pretty severe backlash he is getting.GUTFELD: The interesting thing, too, about this was he did -- this was calculated to restore his left-wing credentials after he got bashed by Spike Lee over that last movie. So he's literally, not literally, figuratively standing on the bodies of the dead and shouting hey, I'm cool, I'm cool.I'm not for boycotts, especially when people who say they're boycotting something they don't normally go to. Like you hear people at FOX going, ""I'm not seeing their movies anymore."" Well, you don't go to their movies.So instead talk about it. Make people aware that he's an idiot. His father knows it now. His father called him an idiot.BOLLING: What do you think, Meghan?RIVERA: Tarantino's father?GUTFELD: Yes.MCCAIN: It's some of the most violent movies that have ever been made, and he's literally commodifying off of violence. His movies glorify criminals, glorify killers.The thing I don't understand -- I lived in Los Angeles for a year last year. There is a special kind of liberal delusion that happens in Hollywood with people where they're so delusional that we're going to start attacking policemen who don't get paid enough and literally put them -- their lives on the line every single day. I'm sick of having this conversation. I think it's such baloney.BOLLING: Geraldo, why would Quentin Tarantino -- he literally called cops murderers.RIVERA: It's not only...BOLLING: That's what his...RIVERA: ... that he called cops murderers, which was horrifying enough. But he did it with the blood of Officer Randolph Holder barely dry on the streets of 102nd Street.He came to New York. And it was prearranged. I'm sure it was. But at least, once the cop gets killed, you say, ""Hey, this is not the time to do a protest that calls cops murderers. Maybe we should give them the"" -- at least bury the cop before you start slandering the whole thin blue line. I thought it was terrible.But what the LAPD union chief just said is, in my view, unconstitutional and illegal. You can't deny Quentin Tarantino's right to make a film, because you don't agree with the hateful things he says.BOLLING: Not a hateful thing. He said just boycott it, just don't go to it.RIVERA: Just don't go to it, right.GUILFOYLE: You know, Tarantino is getting a big-boy lesson now about how the world works and what it means to be held accountable for your actions. He's getting hit in the wallet...GUTFELD: Yes, this ain't a movie.RIVERA: This ain't a movie. This ain't ""Reservoir Dogs.""GUILFOYLE: ... a little bit. Twelve million large, you're about to feel it. I mean, this will have repercussions on him financially and economically. It was incredibly disrespectful. I don't care if it was already on the calendar. Grow up and do the right thing.BOLLING: Send them home.All right. Stay right there, K.G. You're up first on this one. You know when a presidential debate is a joke, when virtually all the late-night comics poke fun at it. Colbert and Kimmel couldn't help themselves as CNBC practically wrote the punchlines for themselves.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARL QUINTANILLA, CNBC ANCHOR: What is your biggest weakness, and what are you doing it address it?STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, CBS'S ""THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"": Yes. They open with the one question that no one in human history has ever answered honestly. When I interviewed for this job, I said my biggest weakness was sometimes I work so hard I forget to cash my paychecks.JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, ABC'S ""JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE"": At a certain point I didn't know if I was watching a debate or ""The View.""(CROSSTALK)(SFX: GUNSHOTS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we'll be right back.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: We'll be right back.GUILFOYLE: Yes, that was brilliant. I mean, it was brilliant. That's the best thing you can say about that debate, was it was sort of comical at some point and insulting in others. But yes, it's fodder for late-night TV, for sure.GUTFELD: This is what -- to repeat what I said in the ""A"" block, this is why it helps the Republicans, because finally the rest of the country, including comedians, who are normally -- only go after conservatives, are actually agreeing with what we've been saying for so long, that media bias exists.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: And I mean, that wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for that debate. So I say more media bias being exposed.RIVERA: It should have been like Barbara Walters, you know, if you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?GUTFELD: Yes. That was next.RIVERA: What's your favorite color?MCCAIN: It has come as a great surprise to a lot of people that there's this liberal media bias. I had friends texting me, like, ""Oh, this actually does exist.""GUTFELD: Yes.MCCAIN: I'm like, ""Where have you been? Happens all the time.""BOLLING: How about this one. How does the idea of rapper Kanye West running for president in 2020 sound? Well, Bush thinks it's funny. That's 43, not Jeb. Check out George Bush's reaction to President Yeezus.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, your thoughts on Kanye West running for president one day? Your thoughts on Kanye West running for president one day?(GEORGE BUSH LAUGHS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I used to work at the White House.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think he'd have a chance in 2020?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God bless you, Mr. President. God bless you. Thank you very much.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have a safe trip.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: He yells back, ""Don't sell that on EBay.""There's the little personality.RIVERA: You see the difference between George W. and his brother Jeb. I mean, why is that? Why do you have such a disconnect? He's one guy. He's chewing gum. He's casual. He's relaxed. Admittedly, he's out of office now. But he's done his post-presidency with such dignity and elan and charisma. Again, charisma, and that's what you don't see in his brother.MCCAIN: One of the most charming men I've ever met in my life is President George W. Bush. I don't know why some families have one personality and another, but that's how it's done.GUILFOYLE: But not everybody is the Rivera family. You've got brother Craig and Geraldo, both cool.RIVERA: Rocking around.GUTFELD: You know what's funny? I was watching that TMZ tape. And it was interesting how polite the paparazzi was, because they knew if they did anything, Secret Service would murder them.BOLLING: Mr. Bush, Mr. Bush, a big fan.GUTFELD: Big fan, Mr. Bush. Big fan, Mr. Bush.BOLLING: Watch TMZ. Big fan.Still to come, our Halloween edition of ""Facebook Friday."" But first, the Halloween police are out in force again on some college campuses. Greg's going to tell you some of the costumes they find offensive this year, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: At the State University of New York at Geneseo, you'll find posters that say ""Halloween Checklist: Is your costume offensive? Check yourself and check your friends.""The poster lists five officials -- five -- that you can call for advice. I say bravo. We should call out these -- this hateful attire. So here's my list. What I hate.Firemen. First, it's sexist. I mean fireman? And it demeans arsonists, an alternative lifestyle where I come from.Ghosts. Isn't it time we checked our alive privilege? Being dead makes you no rest human. Which is why I won't rest until we can marry them, Kimberly.Speaking of, what about zombies? You appropriate dead culture and smear them with grim stereotypes. It's worse than Islamophobia. Zombie phobia turns the afterlife into a humiliation for the decayed. Where is their Gandhi?Freddy Krueger. Great, dress up as a misunderstood disfigured working man. How classist.Policeman. That's comforting, a symbol of oppression to Quentin Tarantino. And those seeking cool cred from black activists. Why don't you just say you hate black people?Sexy French maid. Yes, subservience sure is sexy. What's next, slave?Vampire. Is it their fault they have dietary demands? Do you really think vampires want to drink your blood? Do you think I like being lactose intolerant? You're blood intolerant.Do you know what I'm going as this Halloween? That perceptive person who sees evil in everything. Yes, I'm going as John Harwood, Bozo the Clown for short.BOLLING: Oooh.GUTFELD: I am nothing if not a cheap shot artist.GUILFOYLE: Yes. And he had it coming.GUTFELD: Yes. All right. I know you are -- getting dressed this Halloween.GUILFOYLE: Thank God I'm none of those things you just said.GUTFELD: Here's my theory.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: Kids can do whatever they want and not be offensive. If an adult does something offensive, then they should know better. But do you find anything offensive?RIVERA: I want to know what you're wearing.GUILFOYLE: OK.RIVERA: Short, feathery?That's sexist? Am I approaching sexism?GUILFOYLE: Short, yes. Lacy, in part. But not visible.GUTFELD: Lacy in parts.GUILFOYLE: What else did you say?RIVERA: I don't know. So far, so good.GUILFOYLE: But I love America.GUTFELD: Yes. You do love America. A way to get out of this.GUILFOYLE: I've got a nice little flight suit. A little -- it's actually a dress. I'm going as Maverick.GUTFELD: Wow.RIVERA: I'm almost always Zorro or a pirate. Although I was Harry Potter last year.BOLLING: You're not talking about Halloween, are you?GUTFELD: No, no, no.RIVERA: I'm in charge of the haunted house at my kids' school.GUTFELD: Really? That's an interesting thing to be in charge of.BOLLING: Why do women always want to look hot and sexy in costumes? Wouldn't it be...GUTFELD: Men create the sexy costumes.GUILFOYLE: What do you mean?BOLLING: Because I think it would be cool to be funny.RIVERA: What do you have against sexy?GUILFOYLE: Yes. What if you can't help it, Bolling? I mean, this is the problem.RIVERA: I think that you should have, like, a protest group.GUILFOYLE: You think?RIVERA: A war on sexy women who dress sexy.GUTFELD: It's a war on -- you know what Halloween is? A war on sexy women.MCCAIN: It's one of the only socially acceptable times where women can dress provocatively.GUTFELD: Exactly.MCCAIN: I used to when I was in my 20s. But now that I'm in my 30s. But when people are so offended, I'm like women are walking around almost naked down the street. When I go to a college campus, pretty much naked.GUILFOYLE: The problem is, what else can you get for 30 bucks at Ricky's?RIVERA: I go in brown face, but nobody notices.GUILFOYLE: Aw.GUTFELD: I don't know how to respond to that. So in that case, one must exit this segment quickly. A special Halloween edition of ""Facebook Friday"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MCCAIN: It's time for a special edition of ""Facebook Friday,"" Halloween edition. We've got your questions, so let's begin.OK. The first question from Kathleen G., ""What is your favorite scary movie?"" Anybody?GUTFELD: ""Love Actually.""GUILFOYLE: You hate that movie.GUTFELD: Scariest movie ever. All these people, you're telling you how they feel about love. I swear I slit my wrists every time that thing is on.GUILFOYLE: You really can't stand that movie.GUTFELD: Worst movie ever made.GUILFOYLE: Just because you dislike it so much I watched it again. I found it quite interesting.RIVERA: I love ""Young Frankenstein.""MCCAIN: I love that one, too.GUTFELD: Is that scary, though?RIVERA: It's not scary. But scary is scary. I don't like scary.GUILFOYLE: I don't like scary movies at all. Like, I didn't like the Jason movies, the ""Friday the 13th."" I didn't like, you know, the Freddy Krueger, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" Oh, my gosh.RIVERA: I don't know how -- why people get off on that.GUILFOYLE: I like, you know, movies like ""Bad Boys."" I like ""Top Gun.""BOLLING: Greg, you know what I just saw? I just saw a recent...GUTFELD: Del Toro?BOLLING: Del Toro. ""The House,"" it was scary. But I can't get scared by those things any more. When you're a kid, they scare the heck out of you.RIVERA: No -- ""No Town for Old Men."" That was...MCCAIN: ""No Country for Old Men""? Yes.RIVERA: ""No Country for Old Men."" That was scary.BOLLING: ""Walking Dead."" ""Walking Dead"" is...RIVERA: Do you like ""Walking Dead""?GUILFOYLE: He loves zombies.BOLLING: ... religious. I love zombies.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And one day -- your monologue.GUILFOYLE: You'll be able to marry them. Yes. Then good.GUTFELD: One day.MCCAIN: I liked ""28 Days Later."" The zombie movie.GUTFELD: Because those were fast zombies.MCCAIN: Yes, fast zombies.GUTFELD: The great thing is they discovered that faster zombies are scarier zombies.GUILFOYLE: You know what else is scary? ""I Am Legend,"" another Will Smith movie.GUTFELD: No. Too CGI for me.MCCAIN: All right. Next move -- question, Nora B.: ""What do you hand out as treats on Halloween? What do you hand out as treats on Halloween: candy, fruit or money?""GUILFOYLE: Candy.MCCAIN: Who's handing out money?GUILFOYLE: Well, I do after I run out of candy.GUTFELD: The person that hands out money is the alcoholic in your neighborhood who forgot it was Halloween. So what happens is, the kids show up. They don't know what these kids are doing here. The kids are in costume and they're going, ""Oh, my God, flashback."" And they're freaking out. And they're going -- and all of a sudden, they realize it's Halloween and they start -- I remember this, because I had a guy on my block, and he'd just throw money at me.RIVERA: Dimes -- put dimes in apples.GUTFELD: That's good.GUILFOYLE: With a guy like that, you can go any day of the year. And you just, like, put on some cat ears, and you're like, ""Trick-or-treat."" He's like, ""Here's some bus money. Take it.""RIVERA: Kids want candy, period.BOLLING: Yes. You cannot do the old -- I don't want to deal with the doorbell or I have to go out and put a bowl of candy. The first bowl I do is like this. It's never a girl, it's a boy. And I'll tell you, you can do it all. A great case study would be to film that.GUTFELD: A good sex-difference study.BOLLING: Yes. You put a little...GUILFOYLE: That's what they do, totally.BOLLING: They all do. They don't take one.GUILFOYLE: Ronan changes his costume, like, three times in a night. And goes...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: These candy corn are delicious, probably dirty off the table. Right?MCCAIN: Debby W. wants to know, ""What was your best Halloween costume ever?""BOLLING: I'll just start with this one.MCCAIN: That's a hard one.BOLLING: I once went as -- along the lines of you don't want to look good. It's more fun to look funny. I went as a bug. I went as a big fat bug with a thing like this, and I won. I won a bottle of champagne at Halloween. I looked like an absolute moron. Tights, it was horrible. I think I have that picture. I think I'll bring it in.RIVERA: They say -- my primetime was in the '60s. They say if you remember the '60s, you weren't really there. So I don't remember. I don't -- I definitely don't.GUTFELD: You probably went as Geraldo Rivera.RIVERA: I probably did.MCCAIN: Does anyone ever go as you?RIVERA: Yes. I had some big years where lots of mustache -- mustaches.MCCAIN: I went as Babe-raham Lincoln one year.RIVERA: Babe-raham Lincoln.MCCAIN: Babe-raham Lincoln. Like the Abraham Lincoln hat and a dress?GUILFOYLE: That's cute.GUTFELD: I won an award in second grade for this costume which you could never do now. I went as a hobo. You remember people would go as hobos. You'd put ash on your face and have a pipe and a bundle. And you'd put pillows and show up for school -- If did you that now they'd be going, ""You are making fun of the homeless.""GUILFOYLE: Microaggression, let me get to my...GUTFELD: Get out of here.GUILFOYLE: Yes, totally.RIVERA: I like the little kids, like my daughters in little princess-y things. You know, just going around, they seem so sweet and innocent.GUILFOYLE: Why can't I wear a princess thing?RIVERA: You, too. Around here you could. As a matter of fact, I think I've seen you in the -- what room is that? No. I overthrow the joke there.GUILFOYLE: I was Notre Dame cheerleader, followed up by...RIVERA: I bet were you a great cheerleader.GUILFOYLE: So cute.MCCAIN: Sounds like a good costume.GUTFELD: Yes.MCCAIN: All right. Tatiana N. wants to know ""What age should you stop going trick-or-treating?""RIVERA: Thirteen.GUTFELD: Well, I'd say -- I'd say 10.GUILFOYLE: You're no fun.GUTFELD: At 11, you start egging.RIVERA: Toilet papering.GUTFELD: TP-ing at 11, egging at 12.GUILFOYLE: At a certain point, then, you get too old to go door to door.GUTFELD: And also, it must suck if you're a tall kid, like you're six but you're taller than me -- like 4'8"".GUILFOYLE: That's a lot of people.BOLLING: When a 17-year-old comes to your door looking for candy you're like ""Really, dude? Really? This is all you've got to do?""GUTFELD: Wouldn't it be terrible if you were looking for somebody named Candy. And it happens on Halloween she went missing. And you go, ""Where's Candy?"" People go, ""What are you talking about?""RIVERA: That was such a -- where did that come from?GUILFOYLE: No one knows.Poor Meghan. My girl.MCCAIN: Linda P. wants to know, ""What is your favorite Halloween candy?""GUILFOYLE: Well, today at this exact moment it's candy corn.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: Breaking tonight, a first for Donald Trump, the candidate opening himself up to a Q&A directly from the voters tonight in the battle ground state of New Hampshire. So, how did he do?  You are about to see.Good evening, everybody. And welcome to ""The Kelly File."" I'm Martha MacCallum in tonight for Megyn Kelly. So, Mr. Trump on the campaign trail in the state that will hold the first in the nation primary. He fielded questions from the press and then he launched into a free willing exchange in his very first town hall which is as you can imagine he appeared to enjoy quite a bit. His rivals were all spread out all over town doing the same thing at the same time in this intense contest for attention. And one of them came out swinging against him. We'll tell you who later. Some of the new polls out today suggest the man who some people thought would never run may now have as much support out there as Hillary Clinton does.Fox digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt and host of Fox News ""MediaBuzz"" Howard Kurtz are both here with me tonight and the new numbers that show Trump's gaining some serious ground.But first, let's take you to New Hampshire so you can see some of this yourself. Mr. Trump dished out zingers to both his GOP rivals and to Hillary Clinton and took on his controversial immigration plan, common core and a whole lot more. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are going to work on numerous things. The first thing is building a wall which Mexico will pay for. Okay. We are going to build it. I know how to do it. It's going to be a real wall and not a toy wall like we have right now. That's 10 feet tall and it's a fence. A real wall. And people are going to come into our country. And I want people to come in. I want people of great talent to come in. But I want a lot of people to come in. They have to come in legally. They've got to come in. If we don't have them come in legally, we don't have a country. We don't have borders we don't have a country.There's a very big question as to the anchor babies. They have been talking about it for years. There's a very big question as to whether or not the 14th Amendment actually covers this. We will find out whether or not it does. Changing the 14th Amendment would take years and years, a long drawn out process. A lot of people think that it is absolutely in terms of anchor babies that it is not covered. So, we will going to find out. But look, here is what happened. Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. Wait.  Here's what is happening. A woman is going to have a baby. They wait on the border. Just before the baby they come over to the border. They have the baby in the United States.We now take care of that baby. Social Security, Medicare, education.  Give me a break. It doesn't work that way. The parents have to come in legally. Have I gotten under Jeb Bush's skin? I don't know. I will tell you this. You mentioned the word skin. He said the other day one of the dumber things I have heard ever in politics when talking about Iraq that we the United States he said have to show them that we have skin in the game in order to go into Iraq. We've lost $2 trillion, thousands of lives, wounded warriors who I love all over the place, and he's talking about we have to show them that we have skin in the game? And every time a shot is fired they run?For him to say that we have to show them that we have skin in the game is one of the really dumb statements. I'd say his other dumb statement is an act of love, that they come here for an act of love. And I would say, between common core, his act of love on immigration, and skin in the game with Iraq, that's the third one that we've now added, I don't see how he's electable. I think it's crazy. I think the whole Iran deal is the dumbest deal that you can imagine. I think it's going to go down as one of the worse deals in the history of this country and maybe of the world.It is a total and complete catastrophe and, you know, it is beyond even talking about. It's hard to believe that people -- do we have negotiators, do we have anybody that knows what they are doing? Was he wealthy? He let us down. Mitt Romney let us down. He should have won that election. He failed. He choked. In the end, no different than a golfer that misses a putt on the 18th hole. No different than a man who strikes out a baseball player. He let us down. Mitt Romney should have won that election, and he didn't. Something happened to him. And that's not going to happen to me.You know, I read a lot of the phony reports, a couple of reports today in the paper saying, oh, well, you know, when Donald Trump gets tired of doing this, he is doing great and he's leading all the polls. But some point you'll get -- I'm not going anywhere, folks. I'm not doing this for my health. I'm doing this to make America great again. And again is a very important word. Very important word. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. I got a lot of money. I don't need people funding me like the other candidates. I have people coming up all the time wanting to give me millions of dollars. Five million dollars last week I turned down from one man.I said, I don't want your money. And I think that resonates with people. I really think it resonates with people. Somebody wrote an article that I was a whiner, that I complained. And I said, no, he's actually right. I do complain because our country is in trouble. We are run by people that either are not smart, perhaps they are incompetent, perhaps they have a bad agenda which I actually don't believe. I think they are just not very good at what they do. I think they are incompetent. And said, I'm a whiner, I'm a complainer. And I am, I'm a complainer. And I said, I complain and complain and I whine and I whine until I win and then I win.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: And then I win. But Mr. Trump wasn't done yet. Following that Q&A with the press, he went into another room and spoke to a packed crowd of supporters where he took more questions in between what was pretty much constant cheers. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I heard that Jeb Bush, that Marco Rubio, that Governor Walker.  Who? That's what they're saying, who? They are going to spend a huge amount of money on fighting Trump. And I say, I think that is okay.  Haven't you heard everything already? It is like, sort of like getting boring. So, I think, you know, he can listen, listen -- fired -- but I just heard it. They said they're going to spend -- I love these rowdy crowds. Isn't it great? This spirit. The spirit!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)You know what? I'll tell you what? You know what is happening to Jeb's crowd as you know right down the street? They are sleeping. They are sleeping now. But more than anything else they are politicians. Very good, thank you, I love that word. You know, I had to fill out a form, I was on jury duty the other day. Did you see it?(APPLAUSE)And I enjoyed it. And actually, it was a great experience. But I had to fill out a form and they said, profession. It was a line. It said.  What profession. What is your profession? And I said, I refuse to say I'm a politician. I can't say it. So if you people don't mind you know what I did? I put real estate. Okay? I just couldn't say these politicians, I can't take them. You get a deal signed. They're dancing in the streets of Iran. They are calling for the destruction of Israel and the destruction of the United States. And we're saying, when do we sign? I have never seen anything like it. I have never seen anything, you know, I did write ""The Art of the Deal."" Does anybody ever hear ""The Art of the Deal""?(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Good. Bring it up. Come on. Give me that book. Nice guy. Should I sign it? Give me that book. Come on. Give me that. See? Great.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)President Obama, Secretary Kerry, I highly think you should read this book quickly. Quickly! Quickly!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Most of this horror show has taken place over the last 20 years, wouldn't you say? I mean, just, don't mention the word Christmas and you can't do this and you can't do that. It's out of control and that will change with me. Believe me. I will be fighting and I will be winning because I win. I win. I'm somebody that wins. And that will change. And you know another thing that's going to change? We are in very sad shape as a country and we are more concerned about being politically correct than we are about victory than we are about winning. And I think that's all fine but we are not going to be so politically correct anymore.We are going to get things done. We are going to make this country special. And you know I say sometimes that the American dream is dead but we are going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before and we are going to do that. And the bottom-line is we are going to make America great again and I really love you people and I really appreciate your support. And I want to thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Having a terrible time out there. He told the crowd he is not going anywhere. And why should he, he is leading in the polls among the GOP.Plus, a brand new poll that shows how he would fair and stack up against Hillary Clinton which we're going to show you in a moment.  Analysis is coming up with these two gentlemen. Fine folks they are.  Chris Stirewalt and Howard Kurtz will join us in a moment away.Plus, while Trump has been grabbing the headlines in anchor baby debate in particular today, Carly Fiorina is fighting to move herself up the ladder. But what will she do about the border? She joins us live to lay it out.And first, it was the NAACP and now a leading activist for the group Black Lives Matter may not be black at all. His strange interesting tale.  We will tell you.Dana Loesch reacts to this ""Kelly File"" investigation coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Guys like Perry and our senator from South Carolina Lindsey Graham who's got zero. How do you get zero? Could you explain it to me?  How do you get zero? Does that mean that thousands of people polled you get none? But he has nothing. The people that attacked me, now Rand Paul is going down the tubes. And he hit me all of a sudden. I mean, he was doing very poorly. He hit me, he went down. One of the great honors is that everybody that attacks me seems to go down.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Donald Trump arguing why he thinks he is the best Republican candidate for president as -- New Hampshire tonight. And a new poll out today suggests that he has made some serious gains against the woman who could wind up being his democratic opponent as well. Take a look. This is the -- look across the summer, at how these two match up.  So you've got back in June, Trump trails Hillary Clinton by 24 points just a couple of months ago in the CNN poll. In July, he closed that gap to 16.  Today he trails her by just six points and that has folks on both sides of the aisle wondering what this means for the future of this race.Chris Stirewalt is our Fox News digital politics editor. Howard Kurtz is the host of Fox News ""MediaBuzz."" And we start tonight with Chris.  Chris, good to see you. Good evening.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Good to see you.MACCALLUM: It's nice move form over the summer.STIREWALT: Well, yes. And it's also reflective of the fact that Hillary Clinton, it's hard to tell someday whether Hillary Clinton is running a tire fire or a campaign. She has had a horrendous summer and she finds new ways to make it worse. She finds news ways to be insulting or degrading to voters, to be dismissive of their questions. She is having as bad a summer as Donald Trump is having a good. And on that level, you are not surprised to see the margins close but we also see that Hillary Clinton is in a tough race and I like our poll more than CNN's poll. No offense CNN. I'm sure it's a classy and wonderful poll as Donald Trump would say.  But our poll shows that we have a cluster of Republicans who are all within the summer ahead but all within striking distance of Hillary Clinton.MACCALLUM: Yes. Let's put up our poll that shows Trump at 42, Hillary Clinton at 47 in the FOX poll. Let's take a look at the other big one from CNN that has Trump on top at 24 percent and the rest of these folks really struggling to get some traction. And one other though, this is the one that is sort of the more troublesome for Donald Trump. Fifty eight percent of Republicans believe that they would be better off with somebody else, Chris.STIREWALT: Yes.MACCALLUM: So, you know, there's lots of enthusiasm. He literally in the moments that we just watched in this town hall in New Hampshire, he hit every single hot button issue that he knows is going to get that crowd whipped up. He is enjoying this Chris so much and, you know, what we haven't seen perhaps that kind of joy coming out from some of these other candidates. You know, and a lot of people said, though Trump is not going to want to do this retail politics stuff, he's not going to want to spend time in New Hampshire. He's not going to spend time in Iowa. Look at him, Chris. I mean, he is having the time of his life right now.STIREWALT: He's having the time of his life right now. And in so far as the republican field remains deeply segment Donald Trump and Jeb Bush essentially have the same kind of numbers, which is a group of people that support them. There's a lot of people in their own party and across the broad-spectrum that say, we don't want you, we don't like you. Donald Trump has the advantage though that he is generating excitement and he is generating enthusiasm. So, his hope, the plan, the way forward for Donald Trump is that the republican field stay just as segmented as it is.MACCALLUM: Yes.STIREWALT: If it starts to consolidate and he starts to slip into second place or third place. Then the test for joyfulness comes in.MACCALLUM: Let me ask you this. Because he also brought something up earlier tonight, he said, you know, I hear that, you know, the candidates that I'm running against are getting together, they're going to start spending a lot of money basically doing anti-Trump commercials. He said I think everything is out there, that is bad about me. Should he be worried about that?STIREWALT: I don't think that it is, I don't think Donald Trump's biggest worry are television commercials. Yes, at some point, there will be an effort inside the Republican Party to say, are you sure -- are you really really sure that you want the host of the ""Apprentice"" to be your party's nominee? But then, there is nothing thing that will happen which is it is summer now and it is fun now. It is fun for him. It's fun for everybody. The question is, how does it feel when you get into September and October and we have two or three more debates and Donald Trump has been around for months and months and months. How does it feel for him and how does it feel voters?MACCALLUM: Yes. It's going to get really interesting come fall.  Chris, thank you very much.Let's bring in Howard now and talk a little bit about another phenomenon that happened for Hillary Clinton. And some of these quotes that I'm reading from some in the more liberal sides of the media Howard are pretty stunning because the love fest for Hillary Clinton appears to have ended this week among them.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIA BUZZ"": Part of what is happening Martha and this contrasting poll numbers is that Trump has handled the media brilliantly. And Hillary has handled the media abysmally. So, we have the mainstream media and some liberal columnist saying things like, she is insulting our intelligence on the email mess, using phrases like in the bunker and tone deaf. They are really churning to some degree on the former first lady, just at a time when many pundits who had laughed and ridicule Donald Trump are starting to take him more seriously. Just look at tonight. He holds a town meeting in New Hampshire. So does Jeb Bush.  So does Chris Christie. The three cable networks all take a big chunk of Trump and you teed up your segment about nine minutes of Trump's sound, securing the knowledge I think that people would not be reaching for remotes to turn it off.MACCALLUM: Yes. And Jeb Bush, you know, we have some people looking at that one, too. Apparently it is a smaller crowd. And, you know, this is a long race, obviously. And there is plenty of time for some topsy- turvy in these polls. And I would imagine that that's exactly what we're going to see. But, you know, when you look at the Hillary enthusiasm side as we were just talking about. And you look at quotes like this from the National Journal's Ron Fournier, he says, a year ago, if you would have asked me, hey, would you consider working for Secretary Clinton? I would say, yes. I'd think about it.Now, I don't know if I can trust Hillary Clinton anymore. And it doesn't make me happy to say that. And those numbers are echoed in her trust among the voters. She has got a lot of work to do Howard, to gain that back. And you know, we looked at the, you know, the Orange Press Conference that she held, a lot of shrugging. A lot of, you know, sort of difficult moments. That was not her finest moment to be sure.KURTZ: And I was really struck by those comments by Fournier who has known Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton a long time. Look, Hillary Clinton has given one national television interview, that one CNN weeks ago apparently going to be on ""Ellen"" in a few weeks. And when she does deal with reporters as we saw on the Tuesday press conference she comes off as kind of legalistic and cautious and she did not get ready for views in the media at all digging herself deeper as the questions mount about the email mess. And, you know, by contrast Trump, you know, calls in to three shows before breakfast and he knows how to generate news, and how to drive news cycle whether it's making jokes, attacking his rivals, beating up on the media. You know, a lot of people tell me, we give too much air time and -- to Donald Trump. I think he earns it because he knows how to make news.  Hillary Clinton by contrast seems to be making news only in a negative way appearing to be on the defensive.MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, he was driving the story too. I mean, the anchor baby discussion is now --KURTZ: Everybody.MACCALLUM: -- something that every single other candidate is weighing in on and trying to sound, you know, stronger and differentiate themselves on that issue. So, he is driving the conversation to be sure. Howard, thank you. Good to see you as always.KURTZ: My pleasure. Same here.MACCALLUM: So coming up next, Dr. Ben Carson makes a trip to the border to see the illegal immigration problem first-hand and he makes a surprising admission about what he would do with those who are here in this country illegally.Plus, Carly Fiorina will be here live with her plan for immigration reform and her reaction to her boost in the polls.And take a look at this. Really? A message that says save a life, kill a cop. The details on that, just ahead.And then there is this, folks. Cheaters exposed, hackers reveal personal details on millions of the users of the popular Ashley Madison website which I'm happy to say I never heard about before this hacking happened. We will talk to a lawyer about the legal fallout, coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Developing tonight, presidential candidate Ben Carson drew some big crowds as he toured Arizona. Today, he went to the border to discuss security and immigration reform. But it is what he said about ending birth right citizenship. This has really become a hot button issue over the past couple of days. And what he said about it is getting a lot of attention tonight. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. BEN CARSON, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think we're smart people and I think we can come up with appropriate ways to do things, but for a woman to be pregnant and say, I'm going to go to the United States and have my baby there so that I have an anchor, that is stupid. Why would we fall for that? If they came over here and did that, we can still keep them together by packaging them up and sending them back. They will still be together.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Sounds familiar. Right?Joining me now with that and some more about her own campaign, republican presidential candidate and former CEO of Hewlett Packard Carly Fiorina. Carly, welcome. Good to have you here tonight.CARLY FIORINA, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Nice to be with you, Martha.MACCALLUM: All right. So, now you have basically Donald Trump and Ben Carson sounding the same tune saying that it shouldn't happen, that people shouldn't cross the border, have a baby and then get the benefits of being in this country, that we should package up those families so we're not separating them and send them back where they came from. What do you say?FIORINA: You know, what I have been saying for a long time now, long before Donald Trump declared his candidacy actually is that immigration is a festering problem that we talk about every election cycle and yet somehow it never gets fixed. First we need to secure the border. It takes money, it takes manpower, it takes technology but mostly apparently it takes leadership and political will power. And it is our job to secure our border because a nation that cannot secure its border cannot protect its sovereignty. Secondly, we need to fix the legal immigration system which has been broken for as long as the border has been insecure about 25 years.And by fixing the legal immigration system what I mean is that half the people who are here illegally came on a legal visa and overstayed it.  We didn't know and we didn't do anything about it. We are handing out border crossing cards every day on the Mexican border which permits someone to come for one day and we never check to see if they go home. We don't have an employer verification system that works. It needs to be mandatory.  We need to close down these sanctuary cities so they can't flout the law.  All of that needs to happen and then we need to decide what should happen with those who have come here illegally and stayed here illegally. And in my view, they do not earn a pathway to citizenship. Perhaps someday they can earn some kind of legal status but they can't be citizens because there has to be consequence for people who have done it the right way. Take in the oath, learn our history.MACCALLUM: Well, let me ask you this in terms of the anchor baby issue and the birthright that anyone who is born here becomes an American citizen, it's in the constitution. Is that something we should change in your opinion?FIORINA: No. It is not. It is in our constitution, it has been in our constitution for a very long time. And actually, it would take a constitutional amendment to change it. And so once again what I find disturbing about this conversation a little bit is that we talk about things in election cycles but don't really talk about what it would take to get them done. It would take a constitutional amendment to get that done.  And I think it is far more important now that we focus all of our political energy on doing what we haven't done in 25 years, securing the border and fixing the legal immigration system.MACCALLUM: What are you hearing, you know, when you are traveling around New Hampshire today, you know, what are you hearing from people you are talking to? What is their biggest concerns?FIORINA: You know, I have been out doing town hall meetings in places like New Hampshire and Iowa and South Carolina and elsewhere all across the country for many months now. And I hear the same things all the time.  First, people are concerned about a set of issues that are not going to be surprising to you. Job creation, economic growth, education, health care, national security, immigration, all of those things matter to them.  Secondly, they are sick and tired of politics as usual. They are tired of politicians saying something and never delivering results.They are tired of festering problems. I think they are tired of people talking about, for example, reducing the size of government and yet it doesn't happen in 30 years. And that is why someone like me gains support because what they see is a track record of problem solving and leadership. They see someone who understands the economy, somebody who understands the world and who is in it and how it works, somebody who understands bureaucracies which is what the government has become and it needs to get cut down to size and somebody who understands technology which is pretty important now as well.MACCALLUM: Well, you moved up into the top ten so that message seems to be giving you some traction. It is good to talk to you tonight. Carly Fiorina, thank you very much.FIORINA: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: And coming up, a ""Kelly File"" exclusive. A Wisconsin woman's home ransacked and raided by law enforcement, according to her.  Her personal items confiscated. She was told she could not call a lawyer and she claims that it was all because of an effort to take down Governor Scott Walker. It sounds like such a bizarre story. There are several just like it. And she joins us with hers.And a leading voice in Black Lives Matter, in that movement. The question tonight whether he is actually a white man who is pretending to be black. Why would he do that, one of the issues here that underlie this story and reaction from Dana Loesch and Andell Brown.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Developing tonight, police are investigating a disturbing scene in Nashville, after people there woke up to the sight of this message, save a life, kill a cop, written on the side of a storage trailer.  The trailer's owner said that the message was not there last night, and he was shocked to see it this morning. He since hired a painter to cover up the hateful graffiti. Police are taking vandalism and its message seriously.And tonight, there are new questions about the background of a man named Sean King. He is a prominent activist in the Black Lives Matter movement. And this comes after a new report alleges that King may have lied about his ethnicity. Trace Gallagher live in our west coast newsroom with the story tonight. Hi, Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, LOS ANGELES: Hi, Martha. No one disputes that Sean King was born in 1979 in Versailles, Kentucky, population 8,500. Beyond that there seems to be very little agreement. Sean King has always said his mom who raised him is white, his father who wasn't around is black.  Now some conservative media outlets including Breitbart, the Blaze, and the Daily Caller, claim that King, a prominent leader in the Black Lives Matter movement is not black, and that he has been lying to everyone from fellow activists to Oprah Winfrey. King won a free ride scholarship from Oprah to attend historically black Morehouse College. But Sean King is now responding questioning these outlets' journalistic credibility, saying they got their information from a blogger he calls a known white supremacist.  King then uses social media to point by point refute their allegations and reinforce his life story, even having a former teacher and classmate corroborate his account of being beaten so badly by local red necks in high school that he suffered spinal damage. The friend writes ""He never saw what hit him. He never had a chance. I didn't stop to count how may attacked him, but the number was easily in the neighborhood of a dozen.  They were big white farm boys."" But Breitbart also claims to have gotten Sean King's birth certificate, listing his father as Jeffrey Wayne King, the only Jeffrey Wayne King in Kentucky who is white. Sean King has not responded to the birth certificate allegation, except to say his family is one big mess, quoting again, ""Like many of you, I have siblings I don't know, siblings I'm estranged from, and a family full of secrets, divorce, affairs, and etcetera."" King ends by saying he is done addressing this matter, Martha.MACCALLUM: With more on this, we turn to Dana Loesch, the Host of Dana on the Blaze TV, and Civil Rights Attorney Andell Brown. Welcome, to both of you. Dana, why is this so important?DANA LOESCH, DANA ON THE BLAZE TV HOST: Well Martha, I will be honest with you, until a few days ago I thought he was a white dude. I had no idea that he was pretending or telling people that he was black. And I know some people out there are asking that very question that you just did right now. Well why does this matter? It matters because for the past year we have heard this phrase white privilege thrown around, thrown in people's faces. It's been used as a way to divide. Sean King by the way isn't the first, Rachel Dolezal was the second and now he's the third. And it just seems incredibly ironic. And it matters because of the language and divisiveness that we have seen come out of this movement.MACCALLUM: Andell, do you agree?ANDELL BROWN, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: I think it is divisive to be wondering whether this person is black or white. Why does it matter? We are worried about the content of the character, not the color of their skin. If he stands for justice and equality then he is with the tradition of many people of all colors and ethnicities that have stood up for justice and equality in this nation. That is what makes us great, many different people banding together and standing up for what's right. It doesn't matter if he's black or white.MACCALLUM: I remember the same argument being made with Rachel Dolezal discussion. She was the head of an NAACP chapter, and what was odd though was that she had presented herself as an African-American in order to get scholarships. And that also appears to be part of this story as well, if indeed what is found is true. It raises questions about misrepresenting yourself in general in order to gain some sort of advantage. As everyone said about Rachel Dolezal, if she had just come out and said I'm a white person who cares deeply about these issues and I feel I have every right to run this organization because I feel strongly about it, nobody would have a problem with it. That is where the rub appears to be.LOESCH: And Martha, to get into that as well, we are talking about a guy who has sat as judge and jury of other people's race. He had once suggested to a friend of mine, Lawrence Jones, who is a black conservative that he wasn't black enough somehow. I have watched this guy sit here and call people white supremacist and use the term white privilege, and throw around these terms. So yeah, if you are going to throw around those terms and be out in someone's face as the judge and jury of blackness or whiteness, and this comes up and there are records showing that your dad is white, yeah it becomes an issue because it shows it is ironic and you are a hypocrite.MACCALLUM: And if the color doesn't matter Andell, then why throw all of those phrases around from him?BROWN: Well, I don't know what phrases you are referring to, but even Jesus when asked about his brother and his mother said those people that do my father's will and obey what he says, those are my brothers and sisters.LOESCH: Jesus never lied about being black.(CROSSTALK)BROWN: I'm going to have to go with Jesus.LOESCH: Jesus never lied about god being black. Andell, god loves you but he never did.MACCALLUM: Andell?BROWN: Lied about god being black. I have no idea what color god is, and why that matters. The blood covers everybody. It's not about black or white.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: I think you both made some good points. The bottom line is you need to represent yourself in an honest way, especially when you're talking about racial issues. And if that is not the case of what happened here, then he needs to speak up.BROWN: We love everybody.LOESCH: Quit using the term white, Andell.MACCALLUM: Dana, love you both. We'll see you next time. Thanks for being here.So coming up next, this story, the raids that rocked Wisconsin supporters of Governor Scott Walker are over. But the families who experienced them are finally telling their stories after they were told that they should not speak about this to anyone. Strange doings in the United States of America wait until you hear this story.Next, a mother and son reveal what happened to them in this ""The Kelly File"" exclusive.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Midnight raids on their homes, police with battering rams breaking down their front doors at midnight at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. Never explained why law enforcement was after them. They were forbidden to tell anybody what was going on.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That was Radio Host Rush Limbaugh back in April detailing the raids in Wisconsin that were stopped for good just a few weeks ago.  Tonight, in the Kelly File exclusive, a Wisconsin mother and son break their silence for the first time on television. They will tell us how their home was raided and ransacked in what they call an attempt to take down the Republican Governor of their state, the now Presidential Candidate, Scott Walker. But first, let's go to Trace Gallagher who gives us some background on this from our west coast news room tonight, Trace.GALLAGHER: Martha, the Wisconsin Supreme Court has now put a stop to the John Doe investigation, saying that Wisconsin law enforcement was investigating crimes that were not crimes. Under the John Doe Law, prosecutors had vast authority to seize documents and compel people who are being investigated to stay silent. Critics say this is was a partisan prosecution targeting Wisconsin conservatives and searching for evidence to discredit Republican Governor Scott Walker. The investigations included a series of pre-dawned raids by heavily armed police using battering rams.  Cindy Archer who worked with Governor Walker says in 2011, when police pounded on her door and confronted her, she was completely undressed, and was afraid police would shoot her dogs. She has now filed a civil rights lawsuit challenging the prosecutor's actions. Another Walker associate, Deb Jordahl claims her kids were frightened to death when police stormed her house, and that she was not read her rights, was told to not mention the raid, and to not call a lawyer or she would be hit with contempt of court charges. The same scenario allegedly took place eight more times at different homes. Critics call it bullying by people with badges and law degrees saying the targets were guilty of nothing more than their first amendment rights to support conservative charges. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ERIC O'KEEFE, WISCONSIN CLUB FOR GROWTH: It came after my team because they were effective in political communications, they were resented by the prosecutors -- in league with the left representing the left attitude towards Scott Walker's union reforms, and they used -- under color of law, they pursued us with tactics which themselves are severe punishment.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Investigators say the various accounts of police storming these homes are an exaggeration. They won't call them raids and they say the investigations were legitimate, Martha.MACCALLUM: Fascinating.Joining me now in a ""Kelly File"" exclusive, Deb Jordahl and her son, Adam Jordahl, they say their home was raided with the approval of Milwaukee Wisconsin prosecutor prosecutors. Deb Jordahl is a Principal at Johnson- Jordahl Strategic Communications, and that once had Scott Walker as one of their clients. Deb and Adam, good evening, good to have you with us tonight. I read through the details of your story. It's a shocking story.  It's a head scratcher. I think people will read it and hear it and say how these can possibly happen in the United States of America. But Deb, let me start with you. Give me a brief version of what happened that night.DEBORAH JORDAHL, HOME WAS RAIDED IN 2013: Well, it was actually 6:00 in the morning, it was still dark out. And I saw lights out in the yard.  I heard noise and shortly after that the doorbell rang. The deputy sheriff was at the door, she walked into the foyer, she said everything is ok. We have a warrant to search the house. She asked about Adam. She didn't realize we also had a daughter. And she followed me upstairs. I asked if I could go into my kids by myself to wake them up. And she followed me right in there. So when they woke up they saw an armed deputy standing next to their bed.MACCALLUM: All right. So let me just jump in here for a second, did you have any idea why they were there at your house?JORDAHL: No, none. At the time -- she came in and she said everything is ok, meaning nobody is dead, we are not here because of an emergency. She said we have a warrant to search the house and she wanted to gather everybody together before she read the warrant to us. So we went upstairs and got the kids and we were all corralled into our family room.  She read the warrant to us. And I do want to clarify it read in the warrant was the gag order and that said we couldn't talk to anybody about the investigation, about the raid at all except a lawyer. And it was after she read the warrant and I said I wanted to call a lawyer that she told me I couldn't.MACCALLUM: At this point are you putting together any sort of well I have done work with Scott Walker, there is a huge battle going on in the state right now, they're probably trying to figure out if I'm behind that or if I'm fighting against this or these unions actions are going on in the state? Did you already have an inkling that things were potentially getting ugly because of your support of this group?JORDAHL: Well, what was shocking Martha, was that this was an investigation that started in 2005 over a county veterans fund. And it was 2013, we had already been through the recall campaign, we've been through the original election, and all of a sudden they were investigating us allegedly for things that we did in the 2011 and 2012 recall, so we had no idea. These John Doe investigations are conducted completely in secret.  And we're not -- you know, aside from what's in the warrant, we're really not even allowed to know what it is they suspect us of doing.MACCALLUM: And you know, I understand, we're almost out of time. But I want to ask Adam a quick question. Adam, some people say it didn't happen. You heard that in the report. How can you prove that it did?ADAM JORDAHL, HOME WAS RAIDED IN 2013: Because some of my friends at school saw it happen. You know, you can't have four or five, you know, police cars outside your house at 6:00 in the morning without getting some questions about it later. So as soon as I got to school, a few people were asking me, are you ok? Is your family all right, like what happened? And all I could say to them was I can't tell you that. I can't tell you anything.MACCALLUM: We saw this kind of investigation with the IRS situation, and it appears to be something of the same ilk in a very strong response.  Thank you very much, more to come on that story.And breaking tonight, new unrest in Missouri when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: We're watching a situation tonight that is new unrest in Missouri, after police fatally shot a black man. It happened in St. Louis.  It happened not far from Ferguson. Trace Gallagher reports from our west coast newsroom, what's going on there on the ground, Trace?GALLAGHER: And the reason, Martha, we're not getting brand new pictures is because we're being told that our affiliate is not on the scene because some concern there about some of the protesters maybe having weapons and the news crews don't feel it's safe right now. There have been reports of some unrest and some tear gas being fired in the St. Louis area.  We're talking about North St. Louis. We're told that St. Louis police were executing a search warrant and were about to search a home when two armed men ran out the back door. One of the men turned and fired at police officers we're told who were in pursuit. Police then fired back, killing the man. He has not yet been identified, except that he is a black man in his 20s. And police say he was carrying a stolen gun, a .9 millimeter that apparently had been stolen from some 100, 110 miles away. The other suspect is still on the run tonight. When they went back inside the house in concluded the search warrant, they found crack cocaine, and they found four other weapons. Remember, this comes one year to the day of another prominent shooting in the North St. Louis area that also led to unrest. It comes one year and ten days after the shooting of Michael Brown. We know what that led to. The police officers who were involved in today's shooting, Martha, have, as is standard procedure, been placed on administrative leave. More as it comes in.MACCALLUM: All right, Trace, thank you. We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back, but first, coming up on Hannity.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is the old adage that it's not just the crime, it's the cover-up, her wiping the server and then being unwilling to admit that, that certainly raises a lot of questions.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Still coming up tomorrow, a pretty good line-up. Governor Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, Sheriff David Clark, Marc Thiessen, and Brian Kilmeade, and my friend Bill Hemmer and I will see you in this same space right here in the morning. Thanks for watching tonight, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, have a good night, this is ""The Kelly File.""Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Really hard.Good advice. Really good advice.Really can't say it enough advice.Because if there's one thing I've discovered over the years it is how many brilliant minds have gone to waste, because they've pretty much coasted through the years.The Ivy Leaguer who sat on a degree.Or the newly minted VP who just sat in his office.Clasping the prize, without grasping the fact you have to work to keep the prize. And get more prizes.That's why I think it's good when a governor who gets national attention for getting in peoples' faces, tells kids you first have to get to work.I remember a boss of mine saying the hardest thing about getting to the top, is staying on top.It's hard.And it's not just kids who need to know that hard truth.I can't tell you all the executives I've known over the years, who struggled to get that big office only to stop struggling once they got that office.Coming in a little later. Leaving a little earlier.The newspapers they once devoured, now left untouched.Somehow then shocked to soon find that job they coveted-now cut.I heard it once said that there is nothing wrong with enjoying your success.There is everything wrong assuming you'll always have that success.So you keep plugging away knowing a fine mind is one thing.But without so much as a drop of sweat it is nothing.So no politics here. No controversy here. Just stating the bipartisan obvious thing he said here.I'm glad a governor who's become a rockstar told kids the secret to life's hassles.That he wouldn't be a rockstar if he didn't simply--Hustle.
