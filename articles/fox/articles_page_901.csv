2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/08/08/bill-oreilly-usa-stands-down-face-hostile-action/	Bill O'Reilly: The USA stands down in the face of hostile action	"By Bill O'ReillyThe ISIS terror army now fighting the Kurds in Iraq and in the west Lebanese forces as it tries to establish a Muslim caliphate in the Middle East. The offshoot of al Qaeda now controls much of Iraq and Syria and is threatening Lebanon and Jordan, as well.According to the U.N. at least 200,000 refugees have fled these killers while murdering Christians and other folks they don't like in grisly ways. Yet President Obama has not yet ordered the U.S. military to move against them. The administration continues to study the situation. Although today there were indications that some bombing is being considered.The Obama administration well understand most Americans do not want any reinvolvement in Iraq and are tired of sacrificing for foreign nations. But that is foolish thinking. You don't walk away from a dire threat. You confront it in a smart way. The ISIS army could be downgraded by using American air power and drones without the USA getting directly involved with Iraqi politics which is a fool's errand.That country must sort out its own problems but the ISIS threat extends far beyond Baghdad and here is where the Obama administration is making a big mistake by hiding behind the Iraq's chaos. The USA is allowing Islamic terrorism to gain enormous power.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's important for everyone to understand and the President has made this clear that there are no American military solutions to the problems in Iraq. We can't solve these problems for them.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: But we can diminish the fighting ability of ISIS and we should because they will come after us eventually.There's no question the Americans looks weak in the face of the jihadist threat and Putin's aggression. The Russian tyrant massing forces on the eastern border of Ukraine continuing to saber rattle despite economic sanctions. Does President Obama even have a plan ready to go in case Putin does invade that sovereign country? If so, might it not deter Russia if that plan was made public?It's completely understandable that many Americans do not want to involve our country in faraway places like Ukraine and the Middle East where most Americans will never go and do not understand that the world is interconnected.For example, if the Taliban defeats the Afghan forces that we armed and trained, yet another terror state will re-emerge. And as we saw on 9/11 these fanatics are not just content with brutalizing their own people, they want to kill us and other infidels all over the world.""Talking Points"" have said for years that American power is the last hope in defeating worldwide terrorism. Who will do it if we do not? Spain? But President Obama seems comfortable staying on the sidelines with the rest of the world allowing ISIS and Putin to disrupt civilization. The longer we wait the more painful the inevitable confrontation will be.And that's 'The Memo.'"

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" August 7, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: As commander-in-chief I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq. And so, even as we support Iraqis as they take the fight to these terrorists, American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq because there's no American military solution to the larger crisis in Iraq.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHANNON BREAM, GUEST HOST: That was President Obama just moments ago after announcing U.S. military air drops in Iraq and also authorization for airstrikes in certain conditions.Joe Trippi, former presidential campaign manager for Howard Dean, for a number of Democratic presidential campaigns and he is a Fox News contributor. Joe, always good to see you.JOE TRIPPI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here.BREAM: All right. So, the president is under a lot of pressure. It seems like he sort of made a two-pronged decision here. Of course, to beef up the humanitarian aid, make those drops. But you were hearing from folks that you know there on the ground that airstrikes by somebody were happening. We know the U.S. has authorized them under certain conditions. But it didn't seem clear to me that the president will saying, we've actually done that or that we have it.TRIPPI: Well, somebody has.BREAM: Yes. Somebody has.TRIPPI: I worked in this area in 2010. And I have a lot of friends there and they were -- first, they were calling me in the morning saying please save us, please do something. And then they started to call and say bombs were dropping, that there was air power being unleashed. Now, whether that was the Turks or the US or the Iraqi armed forces, we don't know. But somebody was doing air support there just within the last hours.BREAM: Well, the president made it clear here, we're not going into a new war. He says, no boots on the ground. Do you think those assurances that this will be enough for folk on the left to say, listen, you campaign on getting us out of there, and that's why we voted for you?TRIPPI: Well, right now, I don't think the president cares about the politics. The people are welcoming this news are the Kurdish Christians and the people who are at the north. Who -- if somebody doesn't do something to stop ISIS from moving into Irbil, if Irbil falls, that would just be a -- I mean, an unmitigated disaster. And I don't think anybody on either side isle, the ideological spectrum saw the Kurds being in trouble. That was the one safe place we all thought in Iraq. So, look, I think those people are watching this and welcome this news. It's a real important step for the U.S. to take.BREAM: Absolutely. Joe, always good to see you.TRIPPI: Good to be with you.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2009/06/30/president-obamas-approval-index-rating-takes-dive	President Obama's Approval Index Rating Takes a Dive	"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:Falling MarksToday's Rasmussen reports presidential tracking poll shows that 31 percent of voters surveyed strongly approve of the job president Obama is doing. But 33 percent strongly disapprove. That means the president's approval index rating has fallen below zero for the third time in 10 days.The approval index is calculated by subtracting the number of people who strongly disapprove -- from the number who strongly approve. It currently stands at negative two. That matches President Obama's lowest rating since taking office, which was recorded on June 21. Before that, the index had never dropped below zero.Democratic DissentTwenty pro-life Democrats have sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressing their opposition to any health care reform -- that includes abortion funding.The letter reads: ""We cannot support any health care reform proposals unless it explicitly excludes abortion from the scope of any government-defined or subsidized health insurance plan. Plans to mandate coverage for abortions, either directly or indirectly (are) unacceptable.""Shaun Kenney, the executive director of pro-life group American Life League tells Cybercast News the letter is an indication that not everyone in the Democratic Party has sold out to the abortion lobby. But he says taxpayer dollars are already going to programs that fund abortions: ""Planned Parenthood alone consumes about $349 million a year in federal and state tax subsidies.""Un-Vanity Fair And another case of Sarah Palin derangement syndrome has reared its ugly head. In Vanity Fair's August 2009 issue, Todd Purdum writes in a piece entitled, ""It Came From Wasilla"": ""What does it say about the nature of modern American politics that a public official who often seems proud of what she does not know is not only accepted but applauded?"" Purdum quotes an anonymous friend of presidential nominee John McCain as referring to Palin as ""little shop of horrors.""He writes that on the campaign trail aides ""worried about her mental state: Was it possible that she was experiencing postpartum depression?"" And that, ""no political principle or personal relationship is more sacred than her own ambition.""Blogger Tom Bevan at Real Clear Politics calls it a hit piece: ""Complete with a slew of juicy, negative quotes from insiders and a smoothly crafted narrative that demeans and diminishes Palin's accomplishments.""And Alex Koppelman of the liberal Salon.com Web site calls it ""devastatingly critical... Todd Purdum paints Palin as a narcissistic egomaniac unable to take the advice of others.""-- FOX News Channel's Zachary Kenworthy contributed to this report."
6	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/03/29/will-campaign-manager-controversy-damage-trump/	Will campaign manager controversy damage Trump?	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" March 29, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My understanding is that the report is that he grabbed somebody. And that's, frankly, totally and completely inappropriate. It could have been one of my daughters, for that matter.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is the consequence of the culture of the Trump campaign, the abusive culture, when you have a campaign that is built on personal insults, on attacks, and now physical violence.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I looked at the tape. And by the way, if he was that way, I would have fired him in two seconds. I wouldn't have cared. I couldn't have cared less. But I look at the tape. There is not even a change of expression on her face. Wouldn't you think she would have yelled out a scream or something if she has bruises on her arm? How do you know those bruises weren't there before?(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Donald Trump reacting to the story today that his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was charged by the police in Jupiter, Florida, for misdemeanor battery. This is after a series of tweets, one of them saying ""Why is this reporter,"" referring to Michelle Fields, ""touching me as I leave the news conference? What's in her hand?"" He then went on to say that she essentially started this whole thing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: She was actually, if you look at her, according to a lot of people, she's grabbing at me. And he is acting as an intermediary trying to block her from doing that. The news conference was over. It was done. It was finished. And she was running up and grabbing and asking questions and she wasn't supposed to be doing that.When people see that tape and they take a look at the tape and they take a look at her initial statement before she knew she was on tape. Take a look at that. You have to see it. You take a look at her initial segment, it sounded like she got thrown out of a building.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: OK, here is Michelle Fields' initial statement after that incident. ""When he approached me,"" talking about Trump, ""I asked him about his view on an aspect of affirmative action. Trump acknowledged the question, but before he could answer I was jolted backwards. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless I was shaken.""Here is Corey Lewandowski's reaction immediately on Twitter to that. ""Michelle Fields, you are totally delusional. I never touched you. As a matter of fact, I have never even met you.""All right, that is where we'll start in this surreal day in campaign 2016. Let's bring in our panel: Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of National Review, Charles Lane, opinion writer for the Washington Post, and Tucker Carlson, host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend."" Jonah?JONAH GOLDBERG, NATIONAL REVIEW: Well, this, as you say, has been a surreal campaign. This is one of maybe the best or at least the most recent examples of the gas lighting of America. Don't believe your lying eyes. These guys came out originally saying nothing happen. Then my favorite explanation was when Corey Lewandowski said I only manhandled you was because I thought you were part of the mainstream media, which would make it OK. And I honestly think --BAIER: This is the video that the police put out today. And there you see Lewandowski grabbing her and pulling her back.GOLDBERG: I don't think Lewandowski should have grabbed her. I also don't think it is a vicious or savage beating or anything of the sort. I think if he had done what Michelle Fields originally asked for, what was to apologize and say, hey, look.BAIER: Stuff happens.GOLDBERG: Stuff happened. I got a little carried away. I apologize, this all would have been over. She wouldn't have had to quit her job at Breitbart. But instead, going from denials to bizarre accusations, and it is all just a farrago of lies as far as I can tell. But this kind of thing has worked before. It is like a Jedi mind trick. Don't believe your lying eyes. Believe whatever Donald Trump says from his fancy plane.BAIER: All right, just to be clear, obviously you talk to legal experts in the pantheon on charges, this one is not that serious, but it is serious. It's a battery. A simple battery in Florida or a misdemeanor battery as defined under the statute. It means any actual or intentional touching or striking of another person against that person's will, nonconsensual, the intentional causing bodily harm to another person. You don't have to have an injury. It is a fairly low bar according to the statute. And it's technically criminal battery. That's what he's facing.CHARLES LANE, WASHINGTON POST: I'm looking forward to the trial. I can just imagine the live coverage on all the cable channels of the battery trial of Donald Trump's campaign manager. It is surreal. It truly is.But somewhat to echo Jonah, I wouldn't be surprised. You know, almost every other ostensibly negative thing has somehow worked in Trump's favor. So I wouldn't be surprised if this proves to be another one.But what we have already. What we can conclude already is that it demonstrates once again the sort of basic reflex of Trump. In any situation, his instinct is to make a counter accusation, right, to admit nothing, deny everything, and say, no, wait a minute, they started it. And that's what did here. She grabbed me. So he is placing the blame on to her. And I think with a lot of his fans that will be enough.BAIER: So Tucker, we're spending a lot of time talking about this and we will turn to the campaign here. But the last thing here. Not to minimize what we see on the tape and what happened to Michelle Fields and what she said happen. But is a bigger problem for this campaign the fact that they said it never happened. The candidate said it never happened. And Lewandowski, the campaign manager, says I never touched you. Is that a bigger problem politically?TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Those are all problems. The fact that we're talking about this is a problem I think for everybody. His opponents are acting like Lewandowski is O.J. are engaging in moral grandstanding which I don't think is very attractive or helpful to them either.But the tragedy is for the Trump campaign. This is just another example of the truth about it, which is he is succeeding in spite of his campaign, which is easily distracted and badly run. Any shiny object pulls its attention away. The only reason Trump is where he is, is because his message is resonant. The Democratic Party has abandoned the middle class. They are now the party of the rich and the poor. The Republican Party isn't sure they want the middle class. And Trump is making on his best day a direct pitch to the middle class, except when he's distracted by stuff like this which doesn't help at al.Of course Jonah is right. Just apologize and get it out of the way. But they can't. When the history of this period is written, the dumb people will say it was because he was famous or had mesmerizing hair. No. It was he was right on a couple things that ordinary people agreed with him on and this obscures it.BAIER: The last thing, for president who take office, often it is a benefit to deescalate thing that have bubbled up.LANE: There you go using earth logic again, Bret.(LAUGHTER)LANE: That era is the era we all grew up with. And by that rule -- this is a guy who today says I will not watch Corey Lewandowski's reputation and life be ruined by these outrageous charges which are captured on videotape from a candidate who twice accused Ben Carson of essentially being a pedophile, and it worked for him. So the idea that somehow, yes, the normal rules that yes deescalate, don't do that kind of thing, we're through the looking glass on that kind of stuff.BAIER: Let's turn to Wisconsin now where he is giving an event. The Real Clear Politics average of polls has him up slightly, but it is in recent polls seen Cruz taking a bit of a jump, and you see him down by about 1.7 in the average of recent polls. Today Governor Walker, Scott Walker, endorsed Cruz. What does it look like? It looks like a big battleground, definitely.LANE: I was not surprised of course to see Walker do that. As you remember when he exited the race himself he did so saying we have to do whatever we can to stop Donald Trump. We have to prevent him from getting the nomination. So it was a given he was going to endorse and probably endorse Ted Cruz.What I'm interested to watch as this moves along is whether the Walker organization, which has been turned into a real machine in that state through all the recalls and the two gubernatorial elections, whether he can put that into motion behind Ted Cruz and make up those two or three points.BAIER: That's an important point about the voters in Wisconsin. They are savvy. They've been through all of this. They pay attention to stuff.CARLSON: They are. It does seem like the perfect state for Donald Trump, and no other governor, Nikki Haley who I think is at least as popular in South Carolina as Walker is in Wisconsin was not able of course to affect the outcome of that election. So I'm dubious about that.But I do think this is a pretty significant test for Trump. Everyone knows the truth. If he doesn't get majority of delegates he's in real danger of losing the nomination, maybe to Paul Ryan. The dream of every Republican in Washington is to put in Paul Ryan. They're going to try and do it. He has got to get the majority, and this is an early and significant test.BAIER: We're going to have a big story about the delegates and the hunt for delegates, even the once in states that have already been decided, tomorrow.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
