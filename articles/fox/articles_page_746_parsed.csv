This is a rush transcript from ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" October 30, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good Sunday morning. Thanks for joining us. The FBI reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails, triggering a political earthquake in the race for the White House.Thanks so much for joining us, everybody. I'm Maria Bartiromo. This is ""Sunday Morning Futures."" The Clinton campaign on defense this morning as the bureau reviews newly discovered emails related to its investigation of former Congressman Anthony Weiner.We will talk to former Attorney General Michael Mukasey coming up on where this could be headed now. Talk Donald Trump's plans to kickstart the recovery, an exclusive interview with his economic advisers on how he plans to create new jobs and move the needle on economic growth.We will get that economy panel on track. And then the Trump team pulling out all the stops in the critical battleground of North Carolina. Will the Tar Heel State turn red on election day?We will talk to Governor Pat McCrory coming up as we look ahead this morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Well, the reopening of the Clinton e- mail investigation is causing friction between the Justice Department and the FBI this morning.Attorney General Loretta Lynch warning Director Comey not to send a letter of intent to Congress because it goes against the long-standing policy of the DOJ to avoid public disclosure of any investigation that could potentially impact elections, Hillary Clinton making mention of that in a rally yesterday in Florida.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It is pretty strange -- it's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election.(APPLAUSE)In fact -- in fact, it's not just strange, it's unprecedented. And it is deeply troubling because voters deserve to get full and complete facts.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: But we now Loretta Lynch already inserted herself months ago when she had a private meeting with Bill Clinton right before Hillary Clinton was to be interviewed by the FBI. Judge Michael Mukasey is the former attorney general under President George W. Bush.He joins me right now.Judge, good to see you.MICHAEL MUKASEY, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Your reaction to this first off?MUKASEY: Well, the rule that she cites about not mentioning something on the eve of an election relates to ordinary corruption investigations, where you're talking about a mayor or even a senator, where you can continue the investigation after the election because you don't know what the outcome of it is going to be, and bring a prosecution if necessary after someone takes office. This is not that kind of case, number one.Number two, this was preceded by a determination by, of all people, the -- the FBI director, whose -- it's not his job to determine whether charges are going to be brought or not. So right away, you're dealing with an unusual situation.And according to the reports that I saw, he felt he was between a rock and a hard place, because if these emails came out after the election, he would be accused of suppressing them. So really, they're for his own purpose and to preserve the -- the good name of his agency, he decided to disclose this now.BARTIROMO: And in the letter to the congressional and committee heads, as well as in a letter to the FBI staff, by the way, Jim Comey writes, he felt he needed to go to Congress because he has been saying for so long recently that he's closed the investigation. And obviously, these new emails changes.He has also testified to Congress saying, he was asked a question, ""If you find any new information, will you reopen the investigation?"" So he felt compelled.MUKASEY: Right. All of that said, I don't think anything is going to happen. By anything, I mean any criminal charges under this Justice Department as a result of this, regardless of what's there.BARTIROMO: Tell me about that, though, because when you look at the past - - I don't know, just a few years, when you see the number of people who have actually been penalized for doing just what Hillary Clinton has done, let's look at General Petraeus. Let's look at Mr. Cartwright -- Cartwright (ph). He's going to jail.MUKASEY: Well, he may go to jail. And there are military people in jail now who did far less, who were dishonorably discharged for doing a lot less than she did.BARTIROMO: What do we know at this point of what could be found? I mean, we -- you know, the -- the Dems are saying, look, we want that information by Monday. Is there any way we're going to get a look at what specifically triggered this turnabout?MUKASEY: The report is that it's somewhere in the vicinity of 10,000 possibly -- in any event, it's in the thousands of emails. There's no way that you can review all of those and disclose.And if you disclose only part, and it turns out that something you haven't read yet bears on what you did disclose, that could make it even worse. So the likelihood that we're going to see it by election day, I think, is remote, number one.And number two, even if we did, it's the Justice Department, headed by the attorney general, who serves at the pleasure of the president, who determines whether any charge gets brought, whether anything gets put before a grand jury even in the limited time that we have. And she's already made it clear that that's not happening.BARTIROMO: Catherine Herridge (ph) reporting earlier this morning on Fox News basically saying that this came from the Manhattan FBI investigators, who were investigating Anthony Weiner, the husband of Huma Abedin for sexting an underaged child. And within that investigation, they found these emails.So 10,000 emails -- incredible, by the way, that number. This could be anything from, you know, going against what Hillary Clinton may have said to Congress and to the FBI, and then to actual national security secrets.  I mean, we -- we have no idea what these emails could reveal.MUKASEY: None. And well, speculating about it is just that. It's speculation.BARTIROMO: Is there any chance that Anthony Weiner is trying to, you know, cop a plea, I mean, do a deal -- some kind of a deal with -- with lawmakers saying, look, I'll tell you what I know as Huma Abedin's husband in terms of national security information that was shared with me if you give me a deal with the sexting underage children?MUKASEY: I seriously doubt it. The FBI has the computer. And once they have the computer, they do the looking.It's not a question of Anthony Weiner saying I'll tell you. What's going to tell them is what's on the computer, and that they have.BARTIROMO: You know, I wonder where the pressure for Jim Comey came from because we know that once the -- the New York agents were looking at the Anthony Weiner case, and they tripped over these emails, I guess the story got deeper within the FBI and the government agencies. There was nowhere to hide, is what I'm trying to say, for Jim Comey.What -- what was it, do you think, that made him say I've got to do the right thing here. And even though Loretta Lynch, my boss, is telling me to not get involved, I need to send this letter to Congress.MUKASEY: I can't get inside his head. And I'm not going to try. But once more than one person knows a fact, it's no longer a secret.BARTIROMO: Right. So that after, let's say she wins the election. She becomes president. Where does this investigation go?I mean, we all know that this is going to take months to -- to take place?  But what does that mean if, in fact, she's the commander-in-chief?MUKASEY: I think the investigation, if we're talking about the -- the inquiry in its broadest sense, goes to Congress, because the Justice Department isn't going to pursue it. That's -- that much is clear.And the only people who can pursue it are the -- are the congressional committees. And the only way they will pursue it is if Congress stays in the hands of the Republicans.Of course, it's in the hands of the Republicans until -- until there's a new Congress, i.e. until January. But if -- if the election continues that, either in the House or in the Senate or both, well, then you can figure that Congress will investigate.If Congress turns over, then the likelihood is they won't.BARTIROMO: You know, this -- this could have been also discussed on that plane. I mean, you -- you're a former attorney general.Loretta Lynch is in that role right now. She's got this private meeting with Bill Clinton. And then days later, we find out that Hillary said, oh, I'm going to keep Loretta Lynch as attorney general, should I become president.It's a little too close for comfort.MUKASEY: I -- look, I don't know what was discussed on the plane. But the one thing you can say is that there should have been a member of the A.G. staff.The meeting should never have taken place for starters. But if it did take place, there should have been a member of the A.G. staff present.That's why you have staff people to make sure you have somebody who is witnessing what is being said to you and what you're saying to someone else.BARTIROMO: I mean, have you ever seen a situation where you don't have staff present taking notes with two such high powered people on a -- during such an investigation?MUKASEY: No -- no, I just (ph) -- look, I was -- I was asked by a foreign official, whether I would meet with him. He came to the Justice Department. I met with him.He asked if we could meet privately. The answer was no. And when we sat down with staff present, I was very glad that I said no.BARTIROMO: Your Honor, good to see you.MUKASEY: Good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Judge Michael Mukasey, joining us there. So where does this investigation go from here with just 10 days before the -- the election?We will talk with two members of Congress, one of them actually received a letter from James Comey. That's Senator Ron Johnson. He's up next.Stay with us on that. Let us know what you'd like to hear from him. Send me a tweet on Twitter @mariabartiromo at ""Sunday Futures."" Stay with us.We're looking ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Republicans are praising the move by the FBI to further their investigation into the Clinton emails. But Democrats are not.Top Senate Democrats are demanding more information about the newly discovered emails mentioned in Director Comey's letter. And they want to know what they are, what those details are by tomorrow.They are arguing that the wording is too vague. In part, Comey says this, ""I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails, to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.""Joining me right now is California Congressman Darrell Issa. He's a member of the House Judiciary Committee. Also with me is Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson.He's the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. He was among those who received a letter from James Comey.Gentlemen, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.REP. DARRELL ISSA, R-CALIF.: Thank you, Maria.SEN. RON JOHNSON, R-WIS.: Morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: Senator Johnson, let me kick this up with you. You received the letter. Give us your reaction to the letter and -- and what Jim Comey was trying to tell you in that letter.JOHNSON: Well, first of all, I'm not -- I'm not praising Jim Comey. I think this investigation has been bungled from the start. To me, it's pretty simple, Maria.There is -- there is two statutes to really govern here. And I'm -- I'm going to leave out a lot of the detail.But you have (ph) 18 U.S. Code 2071 (ph) says anyone who willfully conceals, destroys any record of the United States shall be fined under or imprisoned not more than three years and be disqualified from holding any office in the United States. This investigation, you take a look at the immunity agreements, we've been stonewalled every step of the way in terms of trying to find out exactly what is -- you know, how those things came about.But this investigation seemed more designed not to uncover and prosecute but, if anything, to -- to cover up and exonerate. So I'm -- I'm not one praising Jim Comey whatsoever.And my guess is there are people inside the FBI that's pretty unhappy with him.BARTIROMO: So what do you think was the trigger, then, Senator, for him to change course and send this letter to Congress, because we know that Loretta Lynch tried to stop him from doing so? And -- and then I want to ask you about this Yahoo! Account because you know, I mean, you are the -- you are the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.And you have to have an opinion about the fact that Catherine Herridge just reported that Huma Abedin was basically sending her security emails to her Yahoo! account because she said it was easier to print them from her Yahoo! account. Who knows what she sent to that Yahoo! account.So let me get your take first on that. What do you think changed course here for Jim Comey?JOHNSON: Again, I -- I can only speculate, maybe pressure inside the FBI.  But now, you're talking about the mishandling of highly sensitive national security information.And that's exactly what Secretary Clinton did as well. So I mean, the fact of the matter is is we are not really engaged in a -- in a serious investigation here.And when you take a look, one -- one of the things I've asked the State Department is who else is on those email chains because Maria, we all know when you send an email, you know, is that going to the -- the state.gov classification email system or is it going to clintonemail.com.President Obama was emailing Secretary Clinton at clintonemail.com. He had to know. This is -- shows and reveals corruption at the highest levels of government in the White House, in the State Department, in the Department of Justice and the FBI.But that -- that's just the fact. This is such a simple case. It's getting so complex with all these emails. It's actually pretty darn simple.Information was concealed. It was destroyed. It was mishandled. And there are some pretty simple statutes street (ph).I'm -- I'm not a lawyer. I'm not a prosecutor. I look at this. It's pretty cut-and-dried case.BARTIROMO: Well, I think you make a really good point, Senator, because we now know that the president did lie to the American people. He was in an interview, specifically asked, when did you learn that Secretary Clinton was using a private email and a private server, which nobody else had done.Never have you seen anybody use a private server. And he said I learned when everybody else learned and that we know now, it was a lie.JOHNSON: He was -- he was emailing. So were all kinds of people -- high -- high-level officials inside these departments were using that email account.  We know it.If you're -- if you're emailing a Gmail account, you know it. If you're emailing state.gov, you know it.BARTIROMO: Yes.JOHNSON: So no, there -- I think this is a cover-up. I think this is corruption at the highest levels of government.It needs -- it needs proper congressional oversight. The problem is we're being stonewalled every step of the way.Just look at the -- look at the -- the immunity agreements. They were granted to Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson. They're outrageous.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, I want to ask you what your committee is planning to do about it in a second.But Congressman Issa, let me turn to you because you have built your career on trying to fight corruption. You wrote a book about it.You've been trying to do this for years. What's your reaction to what we've learned this weekend?ISSA: Well, I think if the American people understand that when I sent a letter years ago when Hillary Clinton was still secretary, specifically because we had discovered that others were using private emails, so every cabinet officer received a request for are you using a private email server and how are you accounting under the Federal Records Act, at that point, that letter pretty well put Hillary Clinton, if she wasn't already on notice, on notice that those records belong to the American people. And they needed to be retained.If she had left a full copy, even if she had the private server, if she'd left a full and complete copy when she left the State Department, she wouldn't be in this situation today. But very clearly, she sought to avoid public scrutiny of her correspondence, both good and bad.And that's why she's in this position. So when she's complaining that it's only a few days before an election, it's her own fault, including her most close confidant, Huma Abedin, who could have turned that information over and clearly didn't meet that obligation, even though they were both under subpoenas.BARTIROMO: But Congressman, can anybody do anything about it? I mean, in the face of all of this, you've got commander-in-chief basically giving out messages to people, basically saying, she didn't do anything wrong. Keep moving forward.I mean, that -- it starts at the top, right? And he just called you out -- the president did, just the other day on the campaign trail.He said, and here is what he said about you, Congressman Issa. We have it onscreen. ""Issa's primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere.And this is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me. Now, that is the definition of chutzpah."" That's what President Obama said about you late last week, sir.ISSA: Well, he also said there hadn't been a single major scandal during his administration. So there is a little bit of inconsistency with the truth there.But we know that without Congress, and Ron was my partner during my time as chairman of Oversight, without -- without the kind of scrutiny that we've had, we wouldn't know about the gun-running deal.BARTIROMO: Right.ISSA: .the fast and furious. We wouldn't have known the truth about Benghazi. We certainly -- we'd still have the IRS targeting groups for their -- their beliefs.BARTIROMO: That's true.ISSA: So there is a role for Congress. And we have succeeded in shedding light on it. No question at all.BARTIROMO: Yes.ISSA: .if Ron and I are returned to Congress, we're going to have to make sure that laws are put into place that hold the next president more accountable, no matter.BARTIROMO: Yes.ISSA: .which party he's in. And that's Congress's role. It's the one that I'm proud we've tried to do. But there's more to be done.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Senator Johnson. Are you going to do anything about this in terms of the letter that you received?What can you do?JOHNSON: We'll continue to follow up. You know, Donald Trump said it's time to drain the swamp. Hillary Clinton, Senator Feingold -- I ran against (ph) Senator Feingold, they've been swamp creatures for over 30 years.They ought to be flushed down the drain with the rest of the swamp.BARTIROMO: Wow. Gentlemen, thank you very much. We will be watching the developments. We appreciate your time today.We've got brand new Fox News polls from battleground state of North Carolina. We'll talk to the governor next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, now, there are nine days left to go until America votes on a new president. New polling out of North Carolina to share this morning.It shows Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by six points in the key battleground state of North Carolina. I want to point out that this poll was taken before the new revelations about the FBI reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.Joining me right now is the Governor of North Carolina, Pat McCrory.And Governor, it is good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.GOV. PAT MCCRORY, R-N.C.: Thanks for having me again, Maria.  Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: First off, we just showed these polls. Give us a sense of what the people of North Carolina are looking for in their next commander-in- chief.Obviously, Hillary Clinton is in the lead here, 47 percent to 41 percent for North Carolina. What sense do you get from the people in terms of their priorities?MCCRORY: Well, the latest priority before this controversy erupted on Friday was Obamacare increase in premiums. It's going to hit North Carolina extremely hard -- 30 to 40 percent average increases in Obamacare accounts.And that's been taking over the news for the past four or five days. And many of us, including this governor, predicted that.I wanted to challenge Obamacare and I challenged it, joined those states that challenged Obamacare, which lost in a 4-4-1 (ph) decision. The attorney general that I'm running against, Roy Cooper, refused to join in that lawsuit against Obamacare, and was bragging about it up until two or three weeks ago.But now, with this latest Clinton revelation, it's like we're going back to the '90s now. Clinton fatigue is back.And it's going to be very interesting to see what the impact of the polls will be.BARTIROMO: Yes, I was interested in talking with you because I know that you've really been focused on the economy quite a bit there in North Carolina. Things are a lot better under your -- on your watch.And -- and we know that you signed tax reform into law, which put more money in the paychecks of hardworking families. That's one of the issues that we're talking about in this campaign -- tax reform and economic growth that has been very hard to come by.What do you think is needed to actually move the needle on economic growth and jobs for the country overall?MCCRORY: Well, I'll tell you what we did in North Carolina. When I came into office three and a half years ago, we had the fifth highest unemployment rate in the country.We had 9.4 percent unemployment. North Carolina, which is a booming state, was really hurting three and a half years ago.And what I did was lower the corporate tax from 6.6 percent to three percent, lowered the income tax from the high sevens to low fives. And I also paid off $2.6 billion debt we owed for unemployment to the federal government.And we just started seeing a sharp reduction in unemployment. We're now the fourth fastest growing economy in the United States in North Carolina.Our unemployment is 4.7 percent. The cranes are back, especially in Charlotte where I'm at today. So things are going real well.But I also have to remind your viewers, in the eastern part of our state, we're still feeling the effects of hurricane Matthew. You know, that got off the news two weeks ago.But literally, some of our small towns in Eastern North Carolina, the water is just now clearing out. And I've got towns of a thousand to 2,000 people that are literally wiped out. And so.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCRORY: .we're wondering what the impact of that will be on the economy, and plus the human lives. We've lost 28 people due to that hurricane.BARTIROMO: Well, my condolences to you and the entire state, sir. You mentioned Obamacare earlier and the 30 to 40 percent increase that we're going to see next year in premiums.What do you want to see in terms of Obamacare from our next president? Of course, we know that this has been one of the issues that has held back the economy because businesses are reluctant to create new positions because it's too expensive with Obamacare and -- and the requirement to add benefits.MCCRORY: Well, the two biggest concerns that I've been expressing since I've been governor and even when I was mayor of Charlotte when this started was that I'm afraid -- you know, the old way of getting insurance was through your companies. And I'm afraid you're going to have a lot more companies just drop their insurance, pay the penalty, and get out of the insurance business, which is make us more dependent on government brought in (ph) insurance.And that is a big concern of mine. The other thing is there is no provider competition anymore.Now, in the state of North Carolina, we only have one provider. And that's Blue Cross Blue Shield.BARTIROMO: Right.MCCRORY: And they almost pulled out four weeks ago. So this is why the premiums are going up.And who knows what Blue Cross Blue Shield might do next year because their stockholders, their -- their board's going to look at the numbers and that -- well, they share (ph) a responsibility and go, we can't -- we can't do this anymore.BARTIROMO: Right. I mean, and we know that was the reason that United Health pulled out and Aetna pulled out of a number of states in terms of the exchanges. Do you think this reopening by the FBI, reopening of the Clinton email scandal, the reopening of the investigation will have an impact on North Carolinians voter -- voting?MCCRORY: Yes, I do. I think more than anything, it might impact the turnout. I think -- I -- I personally think the turnout will be impacted.We're already seeing the Clinton voters not coming out in numbers that the Obama voters were coming out four years ago at this point in time.I think the turnout will be impacted by this because people are just disgusted with the whole thing. And I think there is Clinton fatigue.And frankly, there was some concern about Mr. Trump, too. It's kind of ironic. In the last three weeks, the media keeps going to me.Well, are you going to still support Trump due to the controversy from two weeks ago? It's going to be interesting if the media turns around and ask my opponent, are you going to still support Hillary Clinton and put the same pressure that they put on the Republican candidates for the last three to nine months. So that's going to be an interesting media dynamic and political dynamic.Will the Democrats start running away down ticket from Hillary Clinton at this point in time?BARTIROMO: And are you supporting Trump?MCCRORY: I am. I am. In fact, I was with Mike Pence yesterday.He was a fellow -- he and I were elected governors at the same time. And Mike and I were working at the N.C. state football game parking lot yesterday.I'm (ph) going to work at Carolina Panther parking lot today. But Mike and I are very close friends.And I -- I consider Mike Pence to just be an excellent vice presidential candidate -- very solid, solid individual.BARTIROMO: We will leave it there. Governor, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.MCCRORY: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: And in another key battleground, new polling shows the candidates neck-and-neck. It is the one state that could make all the difference in this race.Take a look at those numbers when we come right back with Larry Sabato as we navigate this race, nine days left. Back in a minute.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back. We've got some brand-new poll numbers this morning showing a dead heat in the all-important battleground state of Florida, with 29 electoral votes up for grabs in Florida. Hillary Clinton has 45 percent of the vote to Donald trump's 44 percent.That is well within the margin of error. And I should point out that this, too, was taken before the FBI reopened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton and the email scandal. Larry Sabato is with us.He is the director of the Center for Politics at the University in Virginia.Good to see you, Larry. Thanks so much for joining us. Your take on the race so far?LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS: Well, it's the craziest race I've seen since the 1960s. So I -- I always try and prepare for these contests by taking extra vitamins and eating healthy the last couple of weeks.And I think we all need to do that because there are still some twists and turns to come. There will be other October and November surprises before November 8.BARTIROMO: Well, what about this surprise that we just got? Do you think it's going to alter the race, the fact that the FBI is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails?SABATO: Well, I'm calling it the Comey effect. The Comey effect will be real in the presidential contest.And it will be real in the Senate and House contest. I think what Director Comey has done and the actions that he's taken will benefit Donald Trump.I don't know how much, maybe a point or two. We won't know until Wednesday. We need to have a series of good polls come out that are taken over the period when people will have learned about this.And we don't have that yet. And it's going to have an impact in some of the really close Senate and House races. And it will help Republicans rather than Democrats.BARTIROMO: So let -- let me ask you about this investigation and why you think it will be helpful. I mean, there's -- there's the one idea that there are emails that were on Anthony Weiner's P.C. that basically go against what Hillary Clinton may have said to Congress and to the FBI.But then there's also this worry about national security in general.  Catherine Herridge from Fox News reporting earlier that during Abedin's -- Huma Abedin's April FBI interview, she said that she routinely sent State Department Hillary Clinton emails to her personal Yahoo! account to print, saying that the State Department system was too clumsy.So she wanted to send them to her Yahoo! account. Now, fast forward a few months after that, we know that Yahoo! was hacked.SABATO: Well, these are interesting facts. And I'm going to let the partisans argue about them, Maria.I simply look at the polling effects of what has happened. And this has been a major event in the campaign that occurred 11 days before the election.I think it will have the general effect of energizing Trump supporters, as though they needed to be energized more. And it will have the effect of depressing some Clinton voters.Let's remember that 20 million have already votes -- voted. They're -- they're in the bank.And it's infuriated some Democrats. They were very angry at the FBI director for having undertaken what they say is an unprecedented action just before the election.So I'm going to look at what actually happens in the polling places and let the partisans argue about whether there's any there there. And as you know, Maria, there are a lot of different stories circulating, most of them will prove to be false.BARTIROMO: Do you think that in -- in 11 days, independents' viewpoint can be changed by something like this?SABATO: Well, the funny thing about this race, and it fits in with everything we know, is that there really aren't many swing voters. No matter what people tell pollsters, often, they don't want the pollster to know anything about their politics.They consider it an invasion of privacy. But in most cases, the undecideds at this late state, half of them aren't going to vote, Maria.That's -- that's been the tradition for many, many years. Half of them don't show up. And the half that do break in about the proportions that the electorate does as a whole.Maybe -- maybe.BARTIROMO: What is the.SABATO: .this controversy.BARTIROMO: .yes?SABATO: .this controversy may add a point or two to Trump. We'll have to see. I want to let it play out until Wednesday.BARTIROMO: So you think it's more impactful that people will not come out to vote, that they will basically lose interest because they're angry about this as opposed to saying, I'm going to come out and I'm going to help Hillary Clinton?SABATO: Yes. I think essentially, at this point, you're not going to have more than a handful of people switching from Clinton to Trump or Trump to Clinton. Really, how could you?It's such a stark choice. Maybe there are some who will vote for a third party candidate instead. I tend to think they will either not vote or skip the presidential contest, though I'll bet you, the numbers even in that case.BARTIROMO: Yes.SABATO: .are quite small.BARTIROMO: Real quick, you know, for a long time, this economy was about national security -- this election was about national security and the economy. People were voting about who they thought could create more jobs, who they thought could keep them safer.Has this election become more about people want an end to corruption?SABATO: Certainly on the Republican side, it has become that. I think we can all agree that while corruption is an important issue, the economy and fighting terrorism are more important than -- than that.But this is typical of American campaigns, Maria. We -- we rarely see the truly big issues float to the top at the end.Usually, charges, counter-charges, allegations of corruption -- they tend to take over at the end. And that's exactly what we're seeing this year.BARTIROMO: Larry, good to see you. Thank you so much. Larry Sabato, getting (ph) us there.SABATO: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Up next, Donald Trump is calling for major reforms on taxes and trade. He says he can move the needle on the economic growth story.How does his plan move forward? And can he implement what he's looking to do? We will ask members of his economic policy team in an exclusive panel interview on Trump economics next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: A Trump administration will stop Trans-Pacific Partnership, a horror issue (ph).(APPLAUSE)Really bad deal. We are going to stand up to China on its massive currency manipulation, because they are beating our companies because of currency manipulation. We're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent.(APPLAUSE)We're going to cut taxes for middle-class families by hundreds of billions of dollars.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was Donald Trump hammering home his positions on the economy and how to get growth back. Will they resonate with voters on November 8?Want to bring in our exclusive panel this morning from Trump's economic policy team. Wilbur Ross of W.L. Ross and Company is a Trump economic adviser, Peter Navarro of U.C. Irvine business professor and a Trump economic policy adviser.Andy Puzder is the former CEO of CKE Restaurants, Hardee's Carl's Jr. and a Trump victory committee member. And Steven Mnuchin is the Trump campaign finance chairman.Gentlemen, good to see you all. Thank you so much for joining us.WILBUR ROSS, W.L. ROSS AND COMPANY, TRUMP ECONOMIC ADVISER: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Let -- let met kick it off with what Donald Trump just started with, and that was the TPP and the trade deals.Wilbur, you are an international business guy.ROSS: Right.BARTIROMO: You have seen dealings with lots of countries, whether it's (ph) from -- with steel.ROSS: Right.BARTIROMO: .with commodities. Talk to us about Trump's plans for trade because I think they scare some people. He wants to redo all the trade deals.ROSS: Well, they're (ph) -- they should not be scared because Trump is not anti-trade. He's anti-dumb trade.And dumb trade is why we used to a favorable balance of payments with Mexico of $4 to $5 billion a year. But do you know how much the cumulative trade deficits since NAFTA is with Mexico?One trillion dollars -- $1 trillion. That's ridiculous. It doesn't have to be that we have such huge deficits just to have trade.BARTIROMO: I -- I guess the -- the point is, Peter, is if we're redoing NAFTA, and we're going to try to do something different on Trans-Pacific Partnership and we're going to redo all these trade deals at once, isn't that going to be a disruption for the economy rather than actually focusing on revving up economic growth?PETER NAVARRO, BUSINESS PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE: It's going to be a tremendous stimulus. If you look at the drag we have now on our economy, it's a $766 billion a year trade deficit in goods.That's factories and jobs going offshore. To reinforce Wilbur's point, let's take South Korea 2012 deal.This, to me, is the -- the poster child of everything that's wrong with Hillary Clinton or bad trade deals. As secretary of state, she negotiated that.She called it cutting edge. She promised us 70,000 new jobs. What do we have four years later?We've lost 95,000 jobs. We doubled our trade deficit with South Korea.  And you know who's been hit the hardest?It's been the auto and auto parts industry, which has the highest multiplier in terms of jobs. It's places like Ohio, Wisconsin's, Indiana.And this is what the problem is. North Carolina -- so you're talking to Pat McCrory earlier. It's like North Carolina has been hit since 1993 in NAFTA with all of these bad trade deals.So the idea is Donald Trump is a smart negotiator. The art of the trade deal is to go in and have good deals for the American people, use our position as the biggest market in the world.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: .the most powerful economy and do what's right for the American worker, American manufacturer.BARTIROMO: Yes, if that's going to include tariffs on goods coming in.NAVARRO: Tariffs are only at the -- tariffs are only.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That's a threat (ph) -- it's (ph) not just a threat (ph).NAVARRO: .that is not the end game. They're only a negotiating tool to bring each country to the table to give a good deal for the American people. Hillary Clinton's -- look.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: .South Korea -- a hundred thousand jobs gone because she didn't negotiate a good deal. We've got to stop doing that.BARTIROMO: All right. Good point.ROSS: Right. And not all of it should be tariffs. A lot could be just increasing our exports to those countries.China, for example, buys a lot of soybeans from us.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROSS: But they also buy them from other people. If in turn, they would just buy more from us, it would help, same with natural gas, same with a lot of industrial equipment.BARTIROMO: One -- one of the issues is communicating these stories. But does he have the ground game and the money to actually explain the way you both have in terms of what these policies will mean for people's lives?Steven Mnuchin, that's your area. What can you tell us in terms of Trump's ground game and what you're seeing out there from individuals, from businesses?You can't find many CEOs that have given Trump money, right?STEVEN MNUCHIN, FINANCE CHAIRMAN, TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Well, first of all, Maria, we -- we have had a lot of people across the board who have contributed, extremely generous. And as you know, we've had the largest online fundraising for any Republican ever.So we -- we couldn't be more comfortable. The ground game is -- is fully paid for. We worked very closely with Reince at the RNC.We have a terrific ground game, better than they've ever had before. And we just had a massive amount of advertising purchased.So we'll be competing with Hillary head-for-head with advertising this week.BARTIROMO: All right (ph).MNUCHIN: We couldn't be more comfortable with where we are on that.BARTIROMO: OK, so now, you feel that you're going to be competing effectively with Hillary in terms of advertising because she's been throwing out lots of negative ad against Donald Trump?And then there's Obamacare, Andy Puzder. And I want to talk about this as well in (ph) our next segment because this is a lot.There's a lot here. Pick -- pick a state. Arizona is going to see premiums up a hundred and 16 percent.PUZDER: Right.BARTIROMO: This -- we just got this news a week and a half ago. Has that impacted Trump's chances?PUZDER: Oh, I think it's real (ph) -- people are really angry about this.  And if you're one of the millions of people in states like North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, as you mentioned, that have got these huge policy increases, and you were considering voting for Hillary Clinton, I mean, what the hell are you thinking about?I mean, this -- she's just going to make this worse. So Trump's got a plan -- increase competition, increase incentive, so that people want to buy insurance, not that they're mandatorily required to buy it, a system that will really lower cost, increase quality and get everybody covered.That's the kind of system we need. It's not the kind of system Hillary Clinton wants.As a businessman yourself, having seen firsthand the impact of regulation and whether the pendulum goes too far, what has been the impact of Obamacare in terms of small business and -- and mid-sized business as well?PUZDER: Well, it's interesting you ask. There is -- this last year with the seven percent increase in Obamacare premiums, in the restaurant industry, a report by Civic Science came out that said 47 percent of people who had their -- their health care premiums increase are going to restaurants less, and are 30 percent more likely to -- to significantly reduce restaurant visits than people whose health care premiums didn't go up.We're kind of -- we're kind of the canary in the coal mine in that respect because that was the seven -- that was the impact of a seven percent premium increase. Next year, it's 25 percent.BARTIROMO: Right.PUZDER: So it could have a real impact on the entire economy. This -- ObamaCare is a disaster.It needs to be repealed and replaced.BARTIROMO: I want to talk about the other parts of Trump's economic plan.  We've talked trade. Next, let's get into tax cuts.Let's get into rolling back legislation and tapping into energy. That's his plan. More with our exclusive panel on Trump economics, next.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: We are back with members of Donald Trump's economic policy team -- Wilbur Ross, Peter Navarro, Andy Puzder and Steven Mnuchin with me this morning. Let's go through the plan.Number one, cut taxes.ROSS: Right.BARTIROMO: Most -- most important there is the corporate tax rate of 15 percent, which he thinks is going to enable and push businesses to hire more workers and invest. Number two, rolling back regulations.ROSS: Right.BARTIROMO: .in particular, Obamacare. Number three, tapping into energy and number four, redo trade deals that have not worked for America.Taxes -- it's going to be expensive, Wilbur Ross, cutting taxes that much.ROSS: Well, it'll be not as expensive as anybody models because they are failing to take into account the tax revenues that will be generated by ending the trade deficit. That's $220 million more wages that will be taxed.BARTIROMO: OK.ROSS: It's more corporate profits that'll be taxed. Unleashing energy -- same thing -- more wages that'll be taxed, more corporate taxes.We believe it's revenue-neutral when you take the entire plan into account.  As opposed to Hillary's plan, she actually is planning to raise corporate taxes.BARTIROMO: Right.ROSS: She said $275 billion. To put that in proportion, that's seven and a half percent of all business earnings in the country. And it's one and a half percent of the economy.That's going to kill jobs.BARTIROMO: I don't know how you get businesses to raise money and -- and jobs if they're paying more wages and paying more taxes, Peter.NAVARRO: Yes, look, the big picture here is from 1947 to 2001, we grew three and a half percent year in, year out. Life was good. Since then, we've grown less than two percent.What's the problem? It's taxes are too high, regulations too high. It's a $2 trillion tax on our economy from overregulation, Hillary shutting down our oil, natural gas and coal industries in all these bad trade deals, which we've already discussed.What we need to do is go from this -- this new dismal, what they call the new normal, get to three and a half percent or four percent with Donald Trump's plan, that generates an enormous amount of tax revenues so we can pay for everything we need plus create 25 million jobs. That's the vision.If you take something.BARTIROMO: Right.NAVARRO: .like corporate tax and you cut that, we produce in Michigan rather than Mexico -- simple as that.BARTIROMO: Yes. Twenty-five million jobs seems like a big number, Andy (ph).  NAVARRO: Over 10 years.BARTIROMO: Over 10 years. You think that's doable. And you think four percent economic growth is doable based on what we're hearing here?PUZDER: I think it's absolutely doable. And I think it'll better than four percent growth, with the right energy tax, regulatory and trade policies.You know, you can't -- looking at Clinton, you can't grow the economy if your -- if your tax plan is to redistrict income. You can't grow the economy if your energy plan is to address climate change instead of making America energy-independent.And you can't grow the economy if your regulatory plan is to grow the government rather than the economy.BARTIROMO: Right.PUZDER: I mean, it's impossible.BARTIROMO: Steven Mnuchin, we're going to see you soon. We appreciate you joining us this morning.Gentlemen, thank you very much. I'll see you tomorrow, ""Mornings.MNUCHIN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: .with Maria"" at Fox Business Network. See you tomorrow.

This is a rush transcript from ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" October 30, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good Sunday morning. Thanks for joining us. The FBI reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mails, triggering a political earthquake in the race for the White House.Thanks so much for joining us, everybody. I'm Maria Bartiromo. This is ""Sunday Morning Futures."" The Clinton campaign on defense this morning as the bureau reviews newly discovered e-mails related to its investigation of former Congressman Anthony Weiner.We will talk to former Attorney General Michael Mukasey coming up on where this could be headed now. Talk Donald Trump's plans to kickstart the recovery, an exclusive interview with his economic advisers on how he plans to create new jobs and move the needle on economic growth.We will get that economy panel on track. And then the Trump team pulling out all the stops in the critical battleground of North Carolina. Will the Tar Heel State turn red on election day?We will talk to Governor Pat McCrory coming up as we look ahead this morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Well, the reopening of the Clinton e- mail investigation is causing friction between the Justice Department and the FBI this morning.Attorney General Loretta Lynch warning Director Comey not to send a letter of intent to Congress because it goes against the long-standing policy of the DOJ to avoid public disclosure of any investigation that could potentially impact elections, Hillary Clinton making mention of that in a rally yesterday in Florida.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It is pretty strange -- it's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election.(APPLAUSE)In fact -- in fact, it's not just strange, it's unprecedented. And it is deeply troubling because voters deserve to get full and complete facts.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: But we now Loretta Lynch already inserted herself months ago when she had a private meeting with Bill Clinton right before Hillary Clinton was to be interviewed by the FBI. Judge Michael Mukasey is the former attorney general under President George W. Bush.He joins me right now.Judge, good to see you.MICHAEL MUKASEY, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Your reaction to this first off?MUKASEY: Well, the rule that she cites about not mentioning something on the eve of an election relates to ordinary corruption investigations, where you're talking about a mayor or even a senator, where you can continue the investigation after the election because you don't know what the outcome of it is going to be, and bring a prosecution if necessary after someone takes office. This is not that kind of case, number one.Number two, this was preceded by a determination by, of all people, the -- the FBI director, whose -- it's not his job to determine whether charges are going to be brought or not. So right away, you're dealing with an unusual situation.And according to the reports that I saw, he felt he was between a rock and a hard place, because if these e-mails came out after the election, he would be accused of suppressing them. So really, they're for his own purpose and to preserve the -- the good name of his agency, he decided to disclose this now.BARTIROMO: And in the letter to the congressional and committee heads, as well as in a letter to the FBI staff, by the way, Jim Comey writes, he felt he needed to go to Congress because he has been saying for so long recently that he's closed the investigation. And obviously, these new e-mails changes.He has also testified to Congress saying, he was asked a question, ""If you find any new information, will you reopen the investigation?"" So he felt compelled.MUKASEY: Right. All of that said, I don't think anything is going to happen. By anything, I mean any criminal charges under this Justice Department as a result of this, regardless of what's there.BARTIROMO: Tell me about that, though, because when you look at the past - - I don't know, just a few years, when you see the number of people who have actually been penalized for doing just what Hillary Clinton has done, let's look at General Petraeus. Let's look at Mr. Cartwright -- Cartwright (ph). He's going to jail.MUKASEY: Well, he may go to jail. And there are military people in jail now who did far less, who were dishonorably discharged for doing a lot less than she did.BARTIROMO: What do we know at this point of what could be found? I mean, we -- you know, the -- the Dems are saying, look, we want that information by Monday. Is there any way we're going to get a look at what specifically triggered this turnabout?MUKASEY: The report is that it's somewhere in the vicinity of 10,000 possibly -- in any event, it's in the thousands of e-mails. There's no way that you can review all of those and disclose.And if you disclose only part, and it turns out that something you haven't read yet bears on what you did disclose, that could make it even worse. So the likelihood that we're going to see it by election day, I think, is remote, number one.And number two, even if we did, it's the Justice Department, headed by the attorney general, who serves at the pleasure of the president, who determines whether any charge gets brought, whether anything gets put before a grand jury even in the limited time that we have. And she's already made it clear that that's not happening.BARTIROMO: Catherine Herridge (ph) reporting earlier this morning on Fox News basically saying that this came from the Manhattan FBI investigators, who were investigating Anthony Weiner, the husband of Huma Abedin for sexting an underaged child. And within that investigation, they found these e-mails.So 10,000 e-mails -- incredible, by the way, that number. This could be anything from, you know, going against what Hillary Clinton may have said to Congress and to the FBI, and then to actual national security secrets. I mean, we -- we have no idea what these e-mails could reveal.MUKASEY: None. And well, speculating about it is just that. It's speculation.BARTIROMO: Is there any chance that Anthony Weiner is trying to, you know, cop a plea, I mean, do a deal -- some kind of a deal with -- with lawmakers saying, look, I'll tell you what I know as Huma Abedin's husband in terms of national security information that was shared with me if you give me a deal with the sexting underage children?MUKASEY: I seriously doubt it. The FBI has the computer. And once they have the computer, they do the looking.It's not a question of Anthony Weiner saying I'll tell you. What's going to tell them is what's on the computer, and that they have.BARTIROMO: You know, I wonder where the pressure for Jim Comey came from because we know that once the -- the New York agents were looking at the Anthony Weiner case, and they tripped over these e-mails, I guess the story got deeper within the FBI and the government agencies. There was nowhere to hide, is what I'm trying to say, for Jim Comey.What -- what was it, do you think, that made him say I've got to do the right thing here. And even though Loretta Lynch, my boss, is telling me to not get involved, I need to send this letter to Congress.MUKASEY: I can't get inside his head. And I'm not going to try. But once more than one person knows a fact, it's no longer a secret.BARTIROMO: Right. So that after, let's say she wins the election. She becomes president. Where does this investigation go?I mean, we all know that this is going to take months to -- to take place? But what does that mean if, in fact, she's the commander-in-chief?MUKASEY: I think the investigation, if we're talking about the -- the inquiry in its broadest sense, goes to Congress, because the Justice Department isn't going to pursue it. That's -- that much is clear.And the only people who can pursue it are the -- are the congressional committees. And the only way they will pursue it is if Congress stays in the hands of the Republicans.Of course, it's in the hands of the Republicans until -- until there's a new Congress, i.e. until January. But if -- if the election continues that, either in the House or in the Senate or both, well, then you can figure that Congress will investigate.If congress turns over, then the likelihood is they won't.BARTIROMO: You know, this -- this could have been also discussed on that plane. I mean, you -- you're a former attorney general.Loretta Lynch is in that role right now. She's got this private meeting with Bill Clinton. And then days later, we find out that Hillary said, oh, I'm going to keep Loretta Lynch as attorney general, should I become president.It's a little too close for comfort.MUKASEY: I -- look, I don't know what was discussed on the plane. But the one thing you can say is that there should have been a member of the A.G. staff.The meeting should never have taken place for starters. But if it did take place, there should have been a member of the A.G. staff present.That's why you have staff people to make sure you have somebody who is witnessing what is being said to you and what you're saying to someone else.BARTIROMO: I mean, have you ever seen a situation where you don't have staff present taking notes with two such high powered people on a -- during such an investigation?MUKASEY: No -- no, I just (ph) -- look, I was -- I was asked by a foreign official, whether I would meet with him. He came to the Justice Department. I met with him.He asked if we could meet privately. The answer was no. And when we sat down with staff present, I was very glad that I said no.BARTIROMO: Your Honor, good to see you.MUKASEY: Good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Judge Michael Mukasey, joining us there. So where does this investigation go from here with just 10 days before the -- the election?We will talk with two members of Congress, one of them actually received a letter from James Comey. That's Senator Ron Johnson. He's up next.Stay with us on that. Let us know what you'd like to hear from him. Send me a tweet on Twitter @mariabartiromo at ""Sunday Futures."" Stay with us.We're looking ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Republicans are praising the move by the FBI to further their investigation into the Clinton e-mails. But Democrats are not.Top Senate Democrats are demanding more information about the newly discovered e-mails mentioned in Director Comey's letter. And they want to know what they are, what those details are by tomorrow.They are arguing that the wording is too vague. In part, Comey says this, ""I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these e-mails, to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.""Joining me right now is California Congressman Darrell Issa. He's a member of the House Judiciary Committee. Also with me is Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson.He's the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. He was among those who received a letter from James Comey.Gentlemen, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.REP. DARRELL ISSA, R-CALIF.: Thank you, Maria.SEN. RON JOHNSON, R-WIS.: Morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: Senator Johnson, let me kick this up with you. You received the letter. Give us your reaction to the letter and -- and what Jim Comey was trying to tell you in that letter.JOHNSON: Well, first of all, I'm not -- I'm not praising Jim Comey. I think this investigation has been bungled from the start. To me, it's pretty simple, Maria.There is -- there is two statutes to really govern here. And I'm -- I'm going to leave out a lot of the detail.But you have (ph) 18 U.S. Code 2071 (ph) says anyone who willfully conceals, destroys any record of the United States shall be fined under or imprisoned not more than three years and be disqualified from holding any office in the United States. This investigation, you take a look at the immunity agreements, we've been stonewalled every step of the way in terms of trying to find out exactly what is -- you know, how those things came about.But this investigation seemed more designed not to uncover and prosecute but, if anything, to -- to cover up and exonerate. So I'm -- I'm not one praising Jim Comey whatsoever.And my guess is there are people inside the FBI that's pretty unhappy with him.BARTIROMO: So what do you think was the trigger, then, Senator, for him to change course and send this letter to Congress, because we know that Loretta Lynch tried to stop him from doing so? And -- and then I want to ask you about this Yahoo! Account because you know, I mean, you are the -- you are the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.And you have to have an opinion about the fact that Catherine Herridge just reported that Huma Abedin was basically sending her security e-mails to her Yahoo! account because she said it was easier to print them from her Yahoo! account. Who knows what she sent to that Yahoo! account.So let me get your take first on that. What do you think changed course here for Jim Comey?JOHNSON: Again, I -- I can only speculate, maybe pressure inside the FBI. But now, you're talking about the mishandling of highly sensitive national security information.And that's exactly what Secretary Clinton did as well. So I mean, the fact of the matter is is we are not really engaged in a -- in a serious investigation here.And when you take a look, one -- one of the things I've asked the State Department is who else is on those e-mail chains because Maria, we all know when you send an e-mail, you know, is that going to the -- the state.gov classification e-mail system or is it going to clintonemail.com.President Obama was e-mailing Secretary Clinton at clintonemail.com. He had to know. This is -- shows and reveals corruption at the highest levels of government in the White House, in the State Department, in the Department of Justice and the FBI.But that -- that's just the fact. This is such a simple case. It's getting so complex with all these e-mails. It's actually pretty darn simple.Information was concealed. It was destroyed. It was mishandled. And there are some pretty simple statutes street (ph).I'm -- I'm not a lawyer. I'm not a prosecutor. I look at this. It's pretty cut-and-dried case.BARTIROMO: Well, I think you make a really good point, Senator, because we now know that the president did lie to the American people. He was in an interview, specifically asked, when did you learn that Secretary Clinton was using a private e-mail and a private server, which nobody else had done.Never have you seen anybody use a private server. And he said I learned when everybody else learned and that we know now, it was a lie.JOHNSON: He was -- he was e-mailing. So were all kinds of people -- high -- high-level officials inside these departments were using that e-mail account. We know it.If you're -- if you're e-mailing a Gmail account, you know it. If you're e-mailing state.gov, you know it.BARTIROMO: Yes.JOHNSON: So no, there -- I think this is a cover-up. I think this is corruption at the highest levels of government.It needs -- it needs proper congressional oversight. The problem is we're being stonewalled every step of the way.Just look at the -- look at the -- the immunity agreements. They were granted to Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson. They're outrageous.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, I want to ask you what your committee is planning to do about it in a second.But Congressman Issa, let me turn to you because you have built your career on trying to fight corruption. You wrote a book about it.You've been trying to do this for years. What's your reaction to what we've learned this weekend?ISSA: Well, I think if the American people understand that when I sent a letter years ago when Hillary Clinton was still secretary, specifically because we had discovered that others were using private e-mails, so every cabinet officer received a request for are you using a private e-mail server and how are you accounting under the Federal Records Act, at that point, that letter pretty well put Hillary Clinton, if she wasn't already on notice, on notice that those records belong to the American people. And they needed to be retained.If she had left a full copy, even if she had the private server, if she'd left a full and complete copy when she left the State Department, she wouldn't be in this situation today. But very clearly, she sought to avoid public scrutiny of her correspondence, both good and bad.And that's why she's in this position. So when she's complaining that it's only a few days before an election, it's her own fault, including her most close confidant, Huma Abedin, who could have turned that information over and clearly didn't meet that obligation, even though they were both under subpoenas.BARTIROMO: But Congressman, can anybody do anything about it? I mean, in the face of all of this, you've got commander-in-chief basically giving out messages to people, basically saying, she didn't do anything wrong. Keep moving forward.I mean, that -- it starts at the top, right? And he just called you out -- the president did, just the other day on the campaign trail.He said, and here is what he said about you, Congressman Issa. We have it onscreen. ""Issa's primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere.And this is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me. Now, that is the definition of chutzpah."" That's what President Obama said about you late last week, sir.ISSA: Well, he also said there hadn't been a single major scandal during his administration. So there is a little bit of inconsistency with the truth there.But we know that without Congress, and Ron was my partner during my time as chairman of Oversight, without -- without the kind of scrutiny that we've had, we wouldn't know about the gun-running deal.BARTIROMO: Right.ISSA: .the fast and furious. We wouldn't have known the truth about Benghazi. We certainly -- we'd still have the IRS targeting groups for their -- their beliefs.BARTIROMO: That's true.ISSA: So there is a role for Congress. And we have succeeded in shedding light on it. No question at all.BARTIROMO: Yes.ISSA: .if Ron and I are returned to Congress, we're going to have to make sure that laws are put into place that hold the next president more accountable, no matter.BARTIROMO: Yes.ISSA: .which party he's in. And that's Congress's role. It's the one that I'm proud we've tried to do. But there's more to be done.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Senator Johnson. Are you going to do anything about this in terms of the letter that you received?What can you do?JOHNSON: We'll continue to follow up. You know, Donald Trump said it's time to drain the swamp. Hillary Clinton, Senator Feingold -- I ran against (ph) Senator Feingold, they've been swamp creatures for over 30 years.They ought to be flushed down the drain with the rest of the swamp.BARTIROMO: Wow. Gentlemen, thank you very much. We will be watching the developments. We appreciate your time today.We've got brand new Fox News polls from battleground state of North Carolina. We'll talk to the governor next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, now, there are nine days left to go until America votes on a new president. New polling out of North Carolina to share this morning.It shows Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by six points in the key battleground state of North Carolina. I want to point out that this poll was taken before the new revelations about the FBI reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mails.Joining me right now is the Governor of North Carolina, Pat McCrory.And Governor, it is good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.GOV. PAT MCCRORY, R-N.C.: Thanks for having me again, Maria. Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: First off, we just showed these polls. Give us a sense of what the people of North Carolina are looking for in their next commander-in- chief.Obviously, Hillary Clinton is in the lead here, 47 percent to 41 percent for North Carolina. What sense do you get from the people in terms of their priorities?MCCRORY: Well, the latest priority before this controversy erupted on Friday was Obamacare increase in premiums. It's going to hit North Carolina extremely hard -- 30 to 40 percent average increases in Obamacare accounts.And that's been taking over the news for the past four or five days. And many of us, including this governor, predicted that.I wanted to challenge Obamacare and I challenged it, joined those states that challenged Obamacare, which lost in a 4-4-1 (ph) decision. The attorney general that I'm running against, Roy Cooper, refused to join in that lawsuit against Obamacare, and was bragging about it up until two or three weeks ago.But now, with this latest Clinton revelation, it's like we're going back to the `90s now. Clinton fatigue is back.And it's going to be very interesting to see what the impact of the polls will be.BARTIROMO: Yes, I was interested in talking with you because I know that you've really been focused on the economy quite a bit there in North Carolina. Things are a lot better under your -- on your watch.And -- and we know that you signed tax reform into law, which put more money in the paychecks of hardworking families. That's one of the issues that we're talking about in this campaign -- tax reform and economic growth that has been very hard to come by.What do you think is needed to actually move the needle on economic growth and jobs for the country overall?MCCRORY: Well, I'll tell you what we did in North Carolina. When I came into office three and a half years ago, we had the fifth highest unemployment rate in the country.We had 9.4 percent unemployment. North Carolina, which is a booming state, was really hurting three and a half years ago.And what I did was lower the corporate tax from 6.6 percent to three percent, lowered the income tax from the high sevens to low fives. And I also paid off $2.6 billion debt we owed for unemployment to the federal government.And we just started seeing a sharp reduction in unemployment. We're now the fourth fastest growing economy in the United States in North Carolina.Our unemployment is 4.7 percent. The cranes are back, especially in Charlotte where I'm at today. So things are going real well.But I also have to remind your viewers, in the eastern part of our state, we're still feeling the effects of hurricane Matthew. You know, that got off the news two weeks ago.But literally, some of our small towns in Eastern North Carolina, the water is just now clearing out. And I've got towns of a thousand to 2,000 people that are literally wiped out. And so.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCRORY: .we're wondering what the impact of that will be on the economy, and plus the human lives. We've lost 28 people due to that hurricane.BARTIROMO: Well, my condolences to you and the entire state, sir. You mentioned Obamacare earlier and the 30 to 40 percent increase that we're going to see next year in premiums.What do you want to see in terms of Obamacare from our next president? Of course, we know that this has been one of the issues that has held back the economy because businesses are reluctant to create new positions because it's too expensive with Obamacare and -- and the requirement to add benefits.MCCRORY: Well, the two biggest concerns that I've been expressing since I've been governor and even when I was mayor of Charlotte when this started was that I'm afraid -- you know, the old way of getting insurance was through your companies. And I'm afraid you're going to have a lot more companies just drop their insurance, pay the penalty, and get out of the insurance business, which is make us more dependent on government brought in (ph) insurance.And that is a big concern of mine. The other thing is there is no provider competition anymore.Now, in the state of North Carolina, we only have one provider. And that's Blue Cross Blue Shield.BARTIROMO: Right.MCCRORY: And they almost pulled out four weeks ago. So this is why the premiums are going up.And who knows what Blue Cross Blue Shield might do next year because their stockholders, their -- their board's going to look at the numbers and that -- well, they share (ph) a responsibility and go, we can't -- we can't do this anymore.BARTIROMO: Right. I mean, and we know that was the reason that United Health pulled out and Aetna pulled out of a number of states in terms of the exchanges. Do you think this reopening by the FBI, reopening of the Clinton e-mail scandal, the reopening of the investigation will have an impact on North Carolinians voter -- voting?MCCRORY: Yes, I do. I think more than anything, it might impact the turnout. I think -- I -- I personally think the turnout will be impacted.We're already seeing the Clinton voters not coming out in numbers that the Obama voters were coming out four years ago at this point in time.I think the turnout will be impacted by this because people are just disgusted with the whole thing. And I think there is Clinton fatigue.And frankly, there was some concern about Mr. Trump, too. It's kind of ironic. In the last three weeks, the media keeps going to me.Well, are you going to still support Trump due to the controversy from two weeks ago? It's going to be interesting if the media turns around and ask my opponent, are you going to still support Hillary Clinton and put the same pressure that they put on the Republican candidates for the last three to nine months. So that's going to be an interesting media dynamic and political dynamic.Will the Democrats start running away down ticket from Hillary Clinton at this point in time?BARTIROMO: And are you supporting Trump?MCCRORY: I am. I am. In fact, I was with Mike Pence yesterday.He was a fellow -- he and I were elected governors at the same time. And Mike and I were working at the N.C. state football game parking lot yesterday.I'm (ph) going to work at Carolina Panther parking lot today. But Mike and I are very close friends.And I -- I consider Mike Pence to just be an excellent vice presidential candidate -- very solid, solid individual.BARTIROMO: We will leave it there. Governor, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.MCCRORY: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: And in another key battleground, new polling shows the candidates neck-and-neck. It is the one state that could make all the difference in this race.Take a look at those numbers when we come right back with Larry Sabato as we navigate this race, nine days left. Back in a minute.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back. We've got some brand-new poll numbers this morning showing a dead heat in the all-important battleground state of Florida, with 29 electoral votes up for grabs in Florida. Hillary Clinton has 45 percent of the vote to Donald trump's 44 percent.That is well within the margin of error. And I should point out that this, too, was taken before the FBI reopened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton and the e-mail scandal. Larry Sabato is with us.He is the director of the Center for Politics at the University in Virginia.Good to see you, Larry. Thanks so much for joining us. Your take on the race so far?LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS: Well, it's the craziest race I've seen since the 1960s. So I -- I always try and prepare for these contests by taking extra vitamins and eating healthy the last couple of weeks.And I think we all need to do that because there are still some twists and turns to come. There will be other October and November surprises before November 8.BARTIROMO: Well, what about this surprise that we just got? Do you think it's going to alter the race, the fact that the FBI is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mails?SABATO: Well, I'm calling it the Comey effect. The Comey effect will be real in the presidential contest.And it will be real in the Senate and House contest. I think what Director Comey has done and the actions that he's taken will benefit Donald Trump.I don't know how much, maybe a point or two. We won't know until Wednesday. We need to have a series of good polls come out that are taken over the period when people will have learned about this.And we don't have that yet. And it's going to have an impact in some of the really close Senate and House races. And it will help Republicans rather than Democrats.BARTIROMO: So let -- let me ask you about this investigation and why you think it will be helpful. I mean, there's -- there's the one idea that there are e-mails that were on Anthony Weiner's P.C. that basically go against what Hillary Clinton may have said to Congress and to the FBI.But then there's also this worry about national security in general. Catherine Herridge from Fox News reporting earlier that during Abedin's -- Huma Abedin's April FBI interview, she said that she routinely sent State Department Hillary Clinton e-mails to her personal Yahoo! account to print, saying that the State Department system was too clumsy.So she wanted to send them to her Yahoo! account. Now, fast forward a few months after that, we know that Yahoo! was hacked.SABATO: Well, these are interesting facts. And I'm going to let the partisans argue about them, Maria.I simply look at the polling effects of what has happened. And this has been a major event in the campaign that occurred 11 days before the election.I think it will have the general effect of energizing Trump supporters, as though they needed to be energized more. And it will have the effect of depressing some Clinton voters.Let's remember that 20 million have already votes -- voted. They're -- they're in the bank.And it's infuriated some Democrats. They were very angry at the FBI director for having undertaken what they say is an unprecedented action just before the election.So I'm going to look at what actually happens in the polling places and let the partisans argue about whether there's any there there. And as you know, Maria, there are a lot of different stories circulating, most of them will prove to be false.BARTIROMO: Do you think that in -- in 11 days, independents' viewpoint can be changed by something like this?SABATO: Well, the funny thing about this race, and it fits in with everything we know, is that there really aren't many swing voters. No matter what people tell pollsters, often, they don't want the pollster to know anything about their politics.They consider it an invasion of privacy. But in most cases, the undecideds at this late state, half of them aren't going to vote, Maria.That's -- that's been the tradition for many, many years. Half of them don't show up. And the half that do break in about the proportions that the electorate does as a whole.Maybe -- maybe.BARTIROMO: What is the.SABATO: .this controversy.BARTIROMO: .yes?SABATO: .this controversy may add a point or two to Trump. We'll have to see. I want to let it play out until Wednesday.BARTIROMO: So you think it's more impactful that people will not come out to vote, that they will basically lose interest because they're angry about this as opposed to saying, I'm going to come out and I'm going to help Hillary Clinton?SABATO: Yes. I think essentially, at this point, you're not going to have more than a handful of people switching from Clinton to Trump or Trump to Clinton. Really, how could you?It's such a stark choice. Maybe there are some who will vote for a third party candidate instead. I tend to think they will either not vote or skip the presidential contest, though I'll bet you, the numbers even in that case.BARTIROMO: Yes.SABATO: .are quite small.BARTIROMO: Real quick, you know, for a long time, this economy was about national security -- this election was about national security and the economy. People were voting about who they thought could create more jobs, who they thought could keep them safer.Has this election become more about people want an end to corruption?SABATO: Certainly on the Republican side, it has become that. I think we can all agree that while corruption is an important issue, the economy and fighting terrorism are more important than -- than that.But this is typical of American campaigns, Maria. We -- we rarely see the truly big issues float to the top at the end.Usually, charges, counter-charges, allegations of corruption -- they tend to take over at the end. And that's exactly what we're seeing this year.BARTIROMO: Larry, good to see you. Thank you so much. Larry Sabato, getting (ph) us there.SABATO: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Up next, Donald Trump is calling for major reforms on taxes and trade. He says he can move the needle on the economic growth story.How does his plan move forward? And can he implement what he's looking to do? We will ask members of his economic policy team in an exclusive panel interview on Trump economics next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: A Trump administration will stop Trans-Pacific Partnership, a horror issue (ph).(APPLAUSE)Really bad deal. We are going to stand up to China on its massive currency manipulation, because they are beating our companies because of currency manipulation. We're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent.(APPLAUSE)We're going to cut taxes for middle-class families by hundreds of billions of dollars.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was Donald Trump hammering home his positions on the economy and how to get growth back. Will they resonate with voters on November 8?Want to bring in our exclusive panel this morning from Trump's economic policy team: Wilbur Ross of W.L. Ross and Company is a Trump economic adviser; Peter Navarro of U.C. Irvine business professor and a Trump economic policy adviser; Andy Puzder is the former CEO of CKE Restaurants, Hardee's Carl's Jr. and a Trump victory committee member, and Steven Mnuchin is the Trump campaign finance chairman.Gentlemen, good to see you all. Thank you so much for joining us.WILBUR ROSS, FOUNDER, W.L. ROSS AND COMPANY: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Let -- let met kick it off with what Donald Trump just started with, and that was the TPP and the trade deals.Wilbur, you are an international business guy.ROSS: Right.BARTIROMO: You have seen dealings with lots of countries, whether it's (ph) from -- with steel.ROSS: Right.BARTIROMO: .with commodities. Talk to us about Trump's plans for trade because I think they scare some people. He wants to redo all the trade deals.ROSS: Well, they're (ph) -- they should not be scared because Trump is not anti-trade. He's anti-dumb trade.And dumb trade is why we used to a favorable balance of payments with Mexico of $4 to $5 billion a year. But do you know how much the cumulative trade deficits since NAFTA is with Mexico?One trillion dollars -- $1 trillion. That's ridiculous. It doesn't have to be that we have such huge deficits just to have trade.BARTIROMO: I -- I guess the -- the point is, Peter, is if we're redoing NAFTA, and we're going to try to do something different on Trans-Pacific Partnership and we're going to redo all these trade deals at once, isn't that going to be a disruption for the economy rather than actually focusing on revving up economic growth?PETER NAVARRO, BUSINESS PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE: It's going to be a tremendous stimulus. If you look at the drag we have now on our economy, it's a $766 billion a year trade deficit in goods.That's factories and jobs going offshore. To reinforce Wilbur's point, let's take South Korea 2012 deal.This, to me, is the -- the poster child of everything that's wrong with Hillary Clinton or bad trade deals. As secretary of state, she negotiated that.She called it cutting edge. She promised us 70,000 new jobs. What do we have four years later?We've lost 95,000 jobs. We doubled our trade deficit with South Korea. And you know who's been hit the hardest?It's been the auto and auto parts industry, which has the highest multiplier in terms of jobs. It's places like Ohio, Wisconsin's, Indiana.And this is what the problem is. North Carolina -- so you're talking to Pat McCrory earlier. It's like North Carolina has been hit since 1993 in NAFTA with all of these bad trade deals.So the idea is Donald Trump is a smart negotiator. The art of the trade deal is to go in and have good deals for the American people, use our position as the biggest market in the world.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: .the most powerful economy and do what's right for the American worker, American manufacturer.BARTIROMO: Yes, if that's going to include tariffs on goods coming in.NAVARRO: Tariffs are only at the -- tariffs are only.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That's a threat (ph) -- it's (ph) not just a threat (ph).NAVARRO: .that is not the end game. They're only a negotiating tool to bring each country to the table to give a good deal for the American people. Hillary Clinton's -- look.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: .South Korea -- a hundred thousand jobs gone because she didn't negotiate a good deal. We've got to stop doing that.BARTIROMO: All right. Good point.ROSS: Right. And not all of it should be tariffs. A lot could be just increasing our exports to those countries.China, for example, buys a lot of soybeans from us.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROSS: But they also buy them from other people. If in turn, they would just buy more from us, it would help, same with natural gas, same with a lot of industrial equipment.BARTIROMO: One -- one of the issues is communicating these stories. But does he have the ground game and the money to actually explain the way you both have in terms of what these policies will mean for people's lives?Steven Mnuchin, that's your area. What can you tell us in terms of Trump's ground game and what you're seeing out there from individuals, from businesses?You can't find many CEOs that have given Trump money, right?STEVEN MNUCHIN, FINANCE CHAIRMAN, TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Well, first of all, Maria, we -- we have had a lot of people across the board who have contributed, extremely generous. And as you know, we've had the largest online fundraising for any Republican ever.So we -- we couldn't be more comfortable. The ground game is -- is fully paid for. We worked very closely with Reince at the RNC.We have a terrific ground game, better than they've ever had before. And we just had a massive amount of advertising purchased.So we'll be competing with Hillary head-for-head with advertising this week.BARTIROMO: All right (ph).MNUCHIN: We couldn't be more comfortable with where we are on that.BARTIROMO: OK, so now, you feel that you're going to be competing effectively with Hillary in terms of advertising because she's been throwing out lots of negative ad against Donald Trump?And then there's Obamacare, Andy Puzder. And I want to talk about this as well in (ph) our next segment because this is a lot.There's a lot here. Pick -- pick a state. Arizona is going to see premiums up a hundred and 16 percent.PUZDER: Right.BARTIROMO: This -- we just got this news a week and a half ago. Has that impacted Trump's chances?PUZDER: Oh, I think it's real (ph) -- people are really angry about this. And if you're one of the millions of people in states like North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, as you mentioned, that have got these huge policy increases, and you were considering voting for Hillary Clinton, I mean, what the hell are you thinking about?I mean, this -- she's just going to make this worse. So Trump's got a plan -- increase competition, increase incentive, so that people want to buy insurance, not that they're mandatorily required to buy it, a system that will really lower cost, increase quality and get everybody covered.That's the kind of system we need. It's not the kind of system Hillary Clinton wants.As a businessman yourself, having seen firsthand the impact of regulation and whether the pendulum goes too far, what has been the impact of Obamacare in terms of small business and -- and mid-sized business as well?PUZDER: Well, it's interesting you ask. There is -- this last year with the seven percent increase in Obamacare premiums, in the restaurant industry, a report by Civic Science came out that said 47 percent of people who had their -- their health care premiums increase are going to restaurants less, and are 30 percent more likely to -- to significantly reduce restaurant visits than people whose health care premiums didn't go up.We're kind of -- we're kind of the canary in the coal mine in that respect because that was the seven -- that was the impact of a seven percent premium increase. Next year, it's 25 percent.BARTIROMO: Right.PUZDER: So it could have a real impact on the entire economy. This -- Obamacare is a disaster.It needs to be repealed and replaced.BARTIROMO: I want to talk about the other parts of Trump's economic plan. We've talked trade. Next, let's get into tax cuts.Let's get into rolling back legislation and tapping into energy. That's his plan. More with our exclusive panel on Trump economics, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: We are back with members of Donald Trump's economic policy team -- Wilbur Ross, Peter Navarro, Andy Puzder and Steven Mnuchin with me this morning. Let's go through the plan.Number one, cut taxes.ROSS: Right.BARTIROMO: Most -- most important there is the corporate tax rate of 15 percent, which he thinks is going to enable and push businesses to hire more workers and invest. Number two, rolling back regulations.ROSS: Right.BARTIROMO: .in particular, Obamacare. Number three, tapping into energy and number four, redo trade deals that have not worked for America.Taxes -- it's going to be expensive, Wilbur Ross, cutting taxes that much.ROSS: Well, it'll be not as expensive as anybody models because they are failing to take into account the tax revenues that will be generated by ending the trade deficit. That's $220 million more wages that will be taxed.BARTIROMO: OK.ROSS: It's more corporate profits that'll be taxed. Unleashing energy -- same thing -- more wages that'll be taxed, more corporate taxes.We believe it's revenue-neutral when you take the entire plan into account. As opposed to Hillary's plan, she actually is planning to raise corporate taxes.BARTIROMO: Right.ROSS: She said $275 billion. To put that in proportion, that's seven and a half percent of all business earnings in the country. And it's one and a half percent of the economy.That's going to kill jobs.BARTIROMO: I don't know how you get businesses to raise money and -- and jobs if they're paying more wages and paying more taxes, Peter.NAVARRO: Yes, look, the big picture here is from 1947 to 2001, we grew three and a half percent year in, year out. Life was good. Since then, we've grown less than two percent.What's the problem? It's taxes are too high, regulations too high. It's a $2 trillion tax on our economy from overregulation, Hillary shutting down our oil, natural gas and coal industries in all these bad trade deals, which we've already discussed.What we need to do is go from this -- this new dismal, what they call the new normal, get to three and a half percent or four percent with Donald Trump's plan, that generates an enormous amount of tax revenues so we can pay for everything we need plus create 25 million jobs. That's the vision.If you take something.BARTIROMO: Right.NAVARRO: .like corporate tax and you cut that, we produce in Michigan rather than Mexico -- simple as that.BARTIROMO: Yes. Twenty-five million jobs seems like a big number, Andy (ph).NAVARRO: Over 10 years.BARTIROMO: Over 10 years. You think that's doable. And you think four percent economic growth is doable based on what we're hearing here?PUZDER: I think it's absolutely doable. And I think it'll better than four percent growth, with the right energy tax, regulatory and trade policies.You know, you can't -- looking at Clinton, you can't grow the economy if your -- if your tax plan is to redistrict income. You can't grow the economy if your energy plan is to address climate change instead of making America energy-independent.And you can't grow the economy if your regulatory plan is to grow the government rather than the economy.BARTIROMO: Right.PUZDER: I mean, it's impossible.BARTIROMO: Steven Mnuchin, we're going to see you soon. We appreciate you joining us this morning.Gentlemen, thank you very much. I'll see you tomorrow, ""Mornings with Maria"" at Fox Business Network. See you tomorrow.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Mike Pence on new FBI probe into Clinton emails; Robby Mook responds to FBI's October surprise	"This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" October 30, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.  With just over a week until Election Day, a campaign bombshell.  The FBI reopens its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mails.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  They are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America.  HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately.  WALLACE:  The Republican vice presidential nominee, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, responds to the stunning announcement.  GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-IND., VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  We commend the FBI for having the courage to reopen this case, because no one is above the law.  WALLACE:  We'll talk with Pence live, and we'll ask the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, why the FBI is re-examining what Clinton did four months after saying the case was closed.  Then, Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook responds.  Plus, we'll ask our Sunday panel how the FBI's announcement reshapes the presidential race.  All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  The presidential campaign has taken a dramatic turn with the FBI announcement it's reviewing new evidence in the Clinton private e-mail case.  That was triggered by a separate investigation into sexting by former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.  Both the Trump and Clinton camps are calling on the FBI to release the details.  We're going to spend the full hour drilling into the effect all this may have on the race.  We'll speak with Donald Trump's running mate, Governor Mike Pence, Clinton campaign manager, Robby Mook, and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes.  But, first, we want to get the latest from the FBI investigation from chief intelligence correspondent, Catherine Herridge -- Catherine.CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, a law enforcement source tells FOX News that thousands of records are involved.  The New York FBI team assessed them as relevant, telling their colleagues on the Clinton e-mail case, quote, ""We think we've come across some documents pertinent to your investigation.""  Clinton wants the evidence public, which is not standard in ongoing cases.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)CLINTON:  Voters deserve to get full and complete facts.  And so, we've called on Director Comey to explain everything right away, put it all out on the table.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE:  A source close to the FBI probe could not recall issuing a subpoena for Abedin's records, adding they did not believe the device shared by Abedin and Weiner was searched by agents.  Abedin told the FBI in April that she sent State Department e-mails, including this one from Clinton, to her personal Yahoo account, where it was easier to print.  In June, Abedin swore under oath in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that she looked through all her devices that could old government e-mail.  On Thursday, FBI Director James Comey was briefed on the findings.  And that same day, he decided to reinitiate the e-mail case and notify Congress.  The director's decision is described to FOX News as driven by the sheer volume of records and the commitment he made under oath.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAMAR SMITH, R-TEXAS CONGRESSMAN:  Would you reopen the Clinton investigation if you discovered new information that was both relevant and substantial?  JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR:  It's hard for me to answer in the abstract.  We would certainly look at any new and substantial information.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE:  In his memo to employees, Comey said they don't know if the e-mails are significant.  The former FBI agent said anything suggesting intent, lying to investigators, obstruction of justice, or sharing classified information with a foreign entity would warrant such a move.  The director notified the attorney general of his decision, which the Justice Department did not support and there's no expectation that a review can be complete before Election Day, Chris.WALLACE:  Catherine, thank you.  Joining me now live here in studio, the Republican vice presidential nominee, Indiana Governor Mike Pence.  Governor, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""PENCE:  Thank you, Chris.  WALLACE:  What is your reaction to the FBI reopening the Clinton case?  PENCE:  Well, we commend the director of the FBI and the FBI for following through on their word before the Congress, that if there was new information, pertinent information, sufficient to reopen this investigation, that they would inform Congress of that fact and they would move forward.  Look, this is a clearly very serious matter, and we respect the institution of the FBI and are confident they'll handle this in a professional and timely way.  WALLACE:  But FBI officials note that they are just starting to look at these e-mails.  They don't know whether any of them are classified.  They don't even know whether they may be duplicates of e-mails that they've already seen in the investigation.  So, shouldn't you and Mr. Trump be cautious in talking about how significant this is?  PENCE:  Well, I think we have been cautious.  But the simple fact is that the decision by the FBI this summer was incomprehensible to millions of Americans.  The director of the FBI literally called a press conference in which he chronicled one violation of the law after the other and then announced that he was not going to pursue charges or recommend charges against Hillary Clinton in this case.  And two days later, he literally undercut that decision by going before the Congress and saying in so many ways that Hillary Clinton had misrepresented the facts.  You remember that famous dialogue between Trey Gowdy and the director of the FBI, where he said that Hillary Clinton said that nothing marked classified was on her e-mails, was that true?  The director said it was not true.  She had never sent classified e-mails -- that was not true.  So I think what we already know here is troubling to the American people, and it's convincing millions of Americans that Hillary Clinton is just a risky choice in this election.  I think that's why --  WALLACE:  But let me --  PENCE:  -- since Friday, you see more momentum, but frankly, there was enormous momentum in our campaign before Friday because the American people are focusing on the choice.  WALLACE:  You say she's a risky choice.  How does this alter the campaign's message in what is just now nine days?  How do you use this to raise new questions and change voters' minds?  PENCE:  I don't think it alters the campaign at all.  We had tremendous momentum in this campaign before this announcement came.  WALLACE:  I'm talking about the message.  PENCE:  Well, the message is very, very simple.  That the American people have been troubled about the fact that Hillary Clinton continues to refuse to turn over some 33,000 e-mails.  But beyond that, it's Hillary Clinton's record as secretary of state that weakened America's place in the world.  It's her desire to continue the failed economic policies of this administration that have literally stifled the American economy.  The news on Monday that Obamacare premiums are about to go up 25 percent next year all across the country on average is deeply troubling to the American people.  And Hillary Clinton's commitment, as she said to you in that presidential debate, to have people on the Supreme Court that represent a particular view point as opposed to people on the court who will strictly construe and uphold the Constitution, that's our message.  That's why people are rallying around Donald Trump.  WALLACE:  But --  PENCE:  I think it's why you see the polls closing so dramatically.WALLACE:  I want to get back to this question of the FBI announcement, because the fact is, as you try to press your case in these final nine days, your campaign has a big money problem.  I want to put it up on the screen.  As of October 20th, the last filing day, the Clinton campaign had $62 million cash on hand.  The Trump campaign had just $16 million with Trump donating only $31,000 in the first half of the month.  Now, Trump announced Friday that he's kicking in another $10 million.  But you're still way behind and Trump is way short -- a third short of $100 million that he had committed -- promised he was going to commit to the campaign.  The question, has he told you that he's going to put a lot more money in this campaign in this last week now that you have this new revelation?  PENCE:  Well, I think -- I mean, I'm grateful for the extraordinary generosity that Donald Trump and his family have continued to show to this campaign.  And --WALLACE:  But has he told you he's going to put more money in?  PENCE:  He's made it clear we'll have the resources we need to drive our message.  But, look, I mean, from the outset of this campaign, Hillary Clinton has had most of the media, the money, and the special interests on her side.  But Donald Trump has made a connection with millions of Americans because he's talking about making America stronger, making America more prosperous, and the remarkable thing is against this avalanche of paid advertising in states around the country, you still see tremendous momentum in this campaign.  And it's really important to say, Chris, before Friday's announcement literally you saw tremendous momentum as people are coming to the polls.WALLACE:  But here's the problem --  PENCE:  We're seeing absentee ballots in key states.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Governor, here's the problem.  One of the key concerns a lot of voters have about Donald Trump is his temperament.  I just want to show how Trump, how dramatically he changed his mind about the FBI and Comey in just a few hours on Friday.  Here he is.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  The FBI rolled over, and the Department of Justice rolled over.  I have great respect for the FBI for righting this wrong.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  For weeks, Trump has been saying that the election is rigged.  Now in the course of a couple hours on Friday, he says, well, maybe it's not as rigged as I thought it was.  Is that presidential?  PENCE:  Well, I think what you see here is an example of real leadership.  I mean, Donald Trump --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Wait, how is that leadership to say -- I mean, in other words, the argument -- sir, the argument that you could make is Comey, whether you liked it or not, made a good-faith decision last July.  He made a good-faith decision on Friday.  And neither of those show it's rigged.  But Trump was ascribing the worst possible motives to it.  PENCE:  That's because we thought the investigation should never have been closed, Chris.And Donald Trump -- the reason why he's appealed and people all across this country, the reason why you see the momentum in this campaign is because people find in Donald Trump someone that just speaks his mind, straight -- you know, tells people exactly where he stands.  And it was just incomprehensible this summer when the director of the FBI came out and he literally indicted Hillary Clinton in the press and then said we're not recommending that she be indicted.  When anyone in the service -- I mean, you've got General Cartwright and others, people who have done a fraction of the number of things that Hillary Clinton has done in the mishandling of classified information have been prosecuted, and frankly as I said in my vice presidential debate, if my son or Tim Kaine's son had mishandled classified information the way that Hillary Clinton had and the FBI said she had, they would have at least been court-martialed.  It was incomprehensible.  Donald Trump continued to make that case.  But now with new information, I think we all want to recognize that the FBI is stepping forward at this moment and has demonstrated real integrity to keep their word to Republicans and Democrats in the Congress and say we have found what's being described now as a volume of information, new information, and that we have reopened the investigation.  And it's important they told the Congress that before this election.  We're confident they'll work through that in a professional, timely way, but --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Let me ask you, though, you said, Governor, that Trump and one of his strengths, you say, is that he speaks his mind.  You've got a lot of ammunition going into this final week.  You've got this new investigation by the FBI or at least its review of the e-mails.  You've got the WikiLeaks and the revelations about the Clinton Foundation.  You've got the Obamacare premium spike that you've just mentioned.  But Trump gets so easily sidetracked.  In the same week, he was threatening -- sir, he was threatening to sue NBC for releasing the ""Access Hollywood"" tape.  He was threatening to sue the women who had accused him.  What do you say to voters who may worry that Hillary Clinton is corrupt but worry whether or not Donald Trump is competent?  PENCE:  Well, I think -- I think people look at the totality of this campaign, they look at the agenda we're running on.  They look at the totality of a career of a man who has built an extraordinary business.  And they know they're looking at a leader in Donald Trump.  And Donald Trump has an agenda.  Our contract with the American voter, people can go online and read it.  In the first hundred days, after we not only elect the Trump/Pence team but re-elect Republican majorities in the Congress, we're going to turn this country around.  We're going rebuild our military.  We're going to revive our economy through tax relief, repealing Obamacare, better and smarter and tougher trade deals, and we're going to appoint members to the Supreme Court who will strictly construe the Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.  WALLACE:  Governor --  PENCE:  That along with the backdrop of all the politics of personal enrichment that has been at the very center of 30 years of the Clintons in public life the American people want to see come to an end.WALLACE:  Governor, as I said in the debate, your time is up.  But thank you very much.  Governor, thank you.  Especially thank you for coming here to Washington to visit with us.  PENCE:  You bet.  WALLACE:  Now, we want top turn to the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Devin Nunes of California.  Mr. Chairman, the Clinton campaign is suggesting that the e-mails that the FBI has found may just be duplicates of ones that they've already seen.  I want to play for you an exchange that Director Comey had in a congressional hearing last month when some Republicans were complaining about the fact that he had closed the case and there were a bunch of new developments.  Here it is.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIM SENSENBRENNER, R-WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN:  Would this not require a reopening of the investigation to solve those issues?  JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR:  I haven't seen anything that would come near to that kind of situation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Chairman, do you think it's likely that Director Comey reopened this investigation with just 11 days to go before the election with no idea what's in the e-mails and whether or not this is a substantial development or not?  REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALI., CHAIR, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  To me, Chris, this has to be a substantial development.  I just don't see Director Comey opening this case back up 11 days before the election unless it is quite serious.  Now, look, we don't -- there's a lot of different scenarios here that are possible.  Is it possible that maybe some of these e-mails are part of the 33,000 that are missing?  Is it possible there are communications between Huma Abedin and her husband, the former congressman?  There are a lot of scenarios that are possible here, but I think after the several meetings that the Congress had with Director Comey, he was quite clear that the investigation was done and that he would only open it if there was significant information.  My guess is, there must be something significant.  WALLACE:  These e-mails were apparently on a laptop that was shared by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner.  As chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, does it concern you that Anthony Weiner apparently had access to what may have been classified information?  NUNES:  Well, it's the job of the House Intelligence Committee and part of the legislative branch to provide oversight over the executive branch to ensure first and foremost that classified information remains classified.  And that's why, you know, I just can't believe that we've called on Director Clapper to investigate this, to possibly pool this more classified information given out, should Hillary Clinton's staff be given classified briefings at this point?  I think it's a question that needs to be answered.  Now, look, at the end of the day, we don't want to speculate here, but it is our job to make sure this information remains classified.  WALLACE:  You brought up the director of national intelligence, General Clapper.  You have said more than that.  You have said that you believe he should ensure, the director of national intelligence, that Hillary Clinton never gets access again to classified briefings and classified material.  You're talking about the person who in just or a week could be our president-elect.  NUNES:  That is right, because we are a separate branch of government.  And I believe that the information that -- you know, it's just not believable that Secretary Clinton, with all of her experience, decades of experience, decades of receiving classified information, would not have known that she was looking at, analyzing, communicating in classified information over an unsecured network.  It's not believable.  Now, if you go back to what Director Comey sad, he gave a pretty strong indictment back in July, but what he really said was, look, she should have known, she was reckless.  He just didn't have enough information to indict her on this.  WALLACE:  The word out of the FBI is that this investigation -- and I think from all of our sense of the kind of metabolism, if you will, of the FBI -- will not be concluded by Election Day.  Would it be fair to say that if Clinton wins and if Republicans hold on to be the House, you continue to be the chair of House Intelligence, for instance, that there will be investigations, more investigations of the woman who could be our president-elect?  NUNES:  Well, we will clearly investigate all of the information that we have as it relates to classified information being put on unclassified networks where Russians, Chinese, other bad actors could get ahold of the information.  And look, I know --WALLACE:  Even if she's the president-elect, Chairman?  NUNES:  Well, look, I know this is rhetoric, but this is Hillary Clinton's fault.  This is Hillary Clinton who set up a private server.  This is not House Republicans.  And on Friday, Friday night, Secretary Clinton holds a press conference in Iowa and basically she attacks Director Comey, which is ridiculous, and then she goes and during the Q&A portion, she says that a letter was sent -- some letter was sent by the director of the FBI to House Republicans.  Now, look, she knows better.  She was a United States senator.  She was a first lady.  She was secretary of state.  She knows good and well that Republicans and Democrats, the chairman of House intelligence and the House and Senate and ranking members were all notified of this information.  So, you know, just Friday night is another concern of mine.  I mean, she knows the game.  She knows what's going on here.  WALLACE:  Chairman Nunes, we want to thank you.  Thank you for your time today.  Always good to talk with you, sir.  Up next, Hillary Clinton tells the FBI, get all the facts out.  We'll talk with her campaign manager Robby Mook when we come right back.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A look outside the beltway in St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, where Hillary Clinton campaigned this week.  Joining me now from Clinton headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, to discuss Friday's shocker is Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.  Robby, what's your reaction to FBI Director Comey's announcement, and why do you think he did it?  ROBBY MOOK, CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Chris, thanks for having me.You know, we were very surprised by this letter.  And what we're asking at this point is Director Comey just get all the information out on the table, all of it, so that the American people can judge for themselves.  This issue was vetted through for months.  Director Comey came to a conclusion.  We believe the voters have already made up their minds on this issue.  So, we find it very strange that ten days out, that he's putting this letter out there.  And we discovered last night from Yahoo News that he and the Justice Department may not have a warrant to look at these messages.  So, we just want all the information out there.  WALLACE:  Why do you think he did it?  MOOK:  I don't know.  And this is the problem, Chris, is that -- you know, this letter was put out there.  We have no information whatsoever about what might be in those e-mails.  And again, according to Yahoo News, it appears that he may not have seen any of these e-mails at all.  So, we think he has a responsibility to the American people to get the information out there so they can judge for themselves.  WALLACE:  Well, you talked about the responsibility of the American people to get all the information out.  There is someone who knows what's in all those e-mails and that is Huma Abedin.  Has Secretary Clinton asked her what's in those e-mails?MOOK:  Well, Chris, the problem with what you're saying there is we don't know.  We don't know where these e-mails are from.  You're making an inference that it could have been Huma Abedin.  Your guess is as good as anyone.  And this is why Director Comey needs to get all the information out there.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Well, I'm asking you a direct question.  Has Secretary Clinton asked Huma Abedin what was on that laptop that she shared with her husband Anthony Weiner?  MOOK:  She hasn't.  You just offered a hypothetical on the table.  Let me offer you some hypotheticals that I've read in the press.  I've heard a hypothetical that these e-mails have nothing to do with Hillary Clinton whatsoever, that she didn't send or receive any of them.  WALLACE:  That doesn't matter.  It's still the question of what's in the e-mails.  So, why wouldn't she asked Huma Abedin, did you have e-mails on the laptop and what's in them?  Why wouldn't she ask her?  MOOK:  Well, Chris, you and I are on the same page here.  I want to know what's in these e-mails, too.  And Director Comey has put out a letter.  It has three paragraphs.  It says nothing about Huma Abedin.  It says nothing about who these e-mails were to or from.  He just says he has information that may be significant we don't even know if it is.  You showed some of his testimony to Congress just now where they asked, ""If there's significant information, would you reopen the case?"" and he said, ""Yes, we will take a look at it.""  The problem is we learned from Yahoo News last night, we don't even think he's taken a look at any of this.  We don't know if anybody has.  WALLACE:  But again, there is at least -- there's credible reporting out there that this came from the laptop of Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin.  Why on earth wouldn't Hillary Clinton say to her closest personal aide, was there any stuff on your laptop, and what was it?  MOOK:  Chris, again, I appreciate your question because people want answers.  There's nothing about Huma Abedin in the letter that was sent out.  WALLACE:  I know, but why wouldn't Clinton ask her?  MOOK:  Well, why wouldn't Clinton ask anybody?  They could be e-mails from anybody in the world.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  There are no reports it's anybody else except Huma Abedin.  MOOK:  Again, you're putting out some hypotheticals.  There are other hypotheticals that have been put out there.  WALLACE:  It's on t front page of every paper, including, I suspect, although I haven't read it, Yahoo News.  MOOK:  Well, again, I appreciate what you're asking because everybody wants to have the answer.  And there's a person who can answer this question.  And that's Director Comey.  He should -- he should put out more information, get everything on the table.  Release the information itself.  At least provide more detail about what he's talking about.  But ten days out from an election, he's come under intense criticism from former Justice Department officials who said this is entirely a breach of protocol.  There's a standard that, you know, six weeks from an election, you don't put out insinuation like this.  And all that's in that letter is innuendo.  WALLACE:  OK, I want to --  MOOK:  We have no details whatsoever.  WALLACE:  Robby, I want to move on and ask you about Secretary Clinton's reaction.  Here's part of what she said on Friday night.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  If they're going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to Republican members of the House, that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the American people.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Robby, why would she say something that is so flatly untrue?  I have a copy here -- it's not very long.  It's the letter that Comey sent to Congress.  On the front page, it's got the eight Republican chairmen of the committees.  If you turn it over, next, you've got the eight top Democrats on the committee.  Why would she say it was just sent to the Republicans when, in fact, it was sent to the Republicans and Democrats?  MOOK:  You know, Chris, this has been really overhyped.  WALLACE:  Well, she said it, I didn't.  MOOK:  We were all surprised by this letter.  She looked at the front page, and as you just said yourself, on the front page of that memo, it lists those Republican chairs.  Were the Democrats CC'ed at the end?  Absolutely.  She looked at the front page.  She acknowledged, we all acknowledge this was sent to everybody.  What we're concerned and disturbed by is that Director Comey sent a letter saying we have some information, I don't know if it's significant, I don't know if it isn't, he didn't say where it came from --  WALLACE:  But, Robby --  MOOK:  -- he didn't say what it was about.  He didn't even say whether these e-mails were sent or received by Hillary Clinton.  And furthermore, another hypothetical that's out there is that these are duplicates that have already been released.  We need all the information, and Director Comey needs to get it out fast.  WALLACE:  But, Robby, I want to make one more point about this letter.  You say it's hype.  Comey sent the letter about 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday.  Your campaign chairman, John Podesta, put out a statement at 3:45 p.m. in which he made exactly the same charge that this letter had been sent just to the Republicans, not to the Democrats.  Three hour and 15 minutes later, Hillary Clinton makes the same charge.  This was a talking point of your campaign and frankly was a dishonest talking point.  MOOK:  Chris, if your question is whether Democratic leaders were CC'ed on that letter, the answer is absolutely yes.  What's disturbing about this, again, is that a three-paragraph letter with no information whatsoever about what the FBI is talking about was sent to the individuals named on the letter.It took Jason Chaffetz about, I don't know, 15 seconds to leak that out to the press.  And now, all your interviews this morning have been full of hypotheticals and conjectures.  Director Comey owes it to the American people, releasing this just a matter of days before the election, to provide all the information.  That's what we're asking.  Just to get all of it out there and the voters can judge for themselves.  We think the voters actually want to hear about what these two candidates are going to do to make a difference in their lives, not more re-litigating of this e-mail.  WALLACE:  Robby --  MOOK:  And we recognize that the director was under tremendous pressure from Donald Trump and Republican leaders --WALLACE:  And now, he's under tremendous pressure from your side.  The last question I want to ask you is that you're acting as if it was the director who brought this into the election when the fact is that it was Hillary Clinton who brought this into the election.  I want to go back to the e-mail exchange on March 2nd, 2015, when The New York Times broke the story about Hillary Clinton using private e-mails.  We're going to put it up on the screen.  Clinton adviser Neera Tanden, ""Why didn't they get the stuff out like 18 months ago?  So crazy.""  Campaign chairman John Podesta, ""Unbelievable.""  Tanden, ""I guess I know the answer, they wanted to get away with it.""Robby, it was Clinton who delayed and it was Clinton who brought this into the presidential campaign.MOOK: And it is Secretary Clinton who has said this was a mistake. It is Secretary Clinton who cooperated fully with the investigation. And it was Secretary Clinton who accepted the outcome of that investigation. And what secretary Clinton is doing now is saying, if there's new information, get it out on the table. Let's get it out. These could be duplicates.Again, it's been reported these e-mails may not have been sent or received by Secretary Clinton. We don't know anything. And this close to an election, this unprecedented announcement of new information, when - when, again, it's been reported by Yahoo! News that - that the FBI may have not even seen it. That - that - that Director Comey sent this unprecedented letter shortly before the election when he doesn't even know what the information is. That's disturbing. And we're just asking him, get everything out there that he knows.WALLACE:  Robby, thank you. Thanks for joining us today.MOOK: Thanks.WALLACE:  Always good to talk with you.MOOK: Yes, you as well. Thanks for the opportunity.WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss Director James Comey's stunning announcement.Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the FBI decision to reopen the Clinton e-mail investigation? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, a political stunner from the FBI just days before the election.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It might not be as rigged as I thought. What?CLINTON: This new information may not be significant. So, let's get it out.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday group about its impact, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  This is a great man. We are very privileged in our country to have him be director of the FBI.TREY GOWDY, R-SOUTH CAROLINA CONGRESSMAN: That is not the FBI that I used to work with.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Well, that was then when House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy had sharp reactions to FBI Director Comey recommending no charges against Hillary Clinton. But this is now. And now it's Gowdy who is applauding Comey, while it's Pelosi who is expressing concerns.And it's time for our Sunday group.Syndicated columnist George Will. Charles Lane from The Washington Post. Gerald Seib, Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal. And Washington Examiner contributor Lisa Boothe.Well, George, what do you make of Comey's decision to reopen the investigation and to tell Congress about it, over the objection of the Justice Department?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, it's - it's baffling that - the headline coast to coast is, FBI has new evidence. There's no evidence whatever yet that there is new evidence pertaining to the e-mail thing because this is a contentless October surprise at this point. What Mr. Comey said is the e-mails appear to be pertinent. Well, they can be pertinent without being significant because they can be redundant in demonstrating extreme recklessness. The category the FBI invented to avoid accusing her of gross negligence, which is a felony.So we, perhaps, and we don't know this, perhaps the FBI has already seen these documents. They don't know whether they're duplicates or not. This - after the - Mr. Comey has said no reasonable prosecutor could have looked at what they've already looked at and proceeded with a case.Now, the ""i"" in the acronym FBI says investigation. The duty of the FBI is to investigate and when it thinks it has concluded an investigation, to pass its conclusion on to the prosecutorial arm of the Department of Justice, not to write letters to the legislative branch of government. People say, well, this is happening 11 days before the election. No, no, 17 million votes have already been cast. It's happening in the middle of the voting.And, finally, it is said that one of the reasons he rushed to do this, Mr. Comey, is he was afraid of a leak. The FBI can't be trusted not to leak its own investigations? As Chairman Grassley of the Senate Judiciary committee said with some understatement, that the country, at this point, immediately needs some context for all this.WALLACE:  Well, that - that raises the question, Gerry, about why Comey did this. As we saw in a couple of exchanges so far earlier in the show, he was being pressed by Republicans to reopen the investigation. And he's - not - first of all, what he'd seen so far, nothing was of that nature. And I think he used - repeatedly used the word ""substantial."" It had to be something ""substantial"" to reopen the investigation. Can you imagine that he does what he does, in effect reopens the investigation, tells Congress about it, he can read the calendar, 11 days before the election, without any idea what's in here?GERALD F. SEIB, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, that seems to be the case, though. I mean, you know, the - the assumption in this town right away was that he must have found something big or he wouldn't have done this. And then I think upon reflection, it's not clear the FBI has even seen these e-mails. There's a court order required to read the e-mails. There's no allocation that has been delivered yet.WALLACE:  Well - well - but it - certainly the - the part of the FBI that was investigating the sexting scandal - and I can't believe that we're talking about this - they must have seen it because they seized the laptop. They've had it for about a month. And they - he said they came to him with something. So they must have known that there are e-mails here.SEIB: But was the something the existence of the e-mails or the substance of the e-mails? That we don't know yet. But I think the - the point, and more - more directly to respond to your question, is that I think Director Comey had to be convinced that he was in an impossible situation. That if he didn't say something now and it became clear after the election that something new and potentially significant had arisen and he hadn't said anything, he would be excoriated for that. Instead, he's being excoriated for this. He's managed to accomplish bipartisanship in Washington. He's gotten everybody mad at him.WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and a bunch of you are skeptical about the FBI announcement. We got this on Facebook from Carl Baker. ""How can these new e-mails be more damning than those found in the previous investigation? As the FBI has already made it clear that she, ""Clinton, "" is untouchable, what's the point of this new investigation?""Lisa, how do you answer Carl?LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CONTRIBUTOR: I don't know. I mean I think we're all operating a lot of hypotheticals here because there isn't a lot of information that is absolute that is out there. All we really know is the letter the FBI Director Comey sent to Congress, as well as the internal memo that he sent to his FBI colleagues, I mean that's really all the information that we know definitively.But, you know, watching the interview you did with Robby Mook, I mean, it's very interesting for the Clinton campaign to say that they want the information out there when Hillary Clinton had taken the unprecedented action of setting up a private server in the first place, deleting tens of thousands of e-mails and then stone walling the process and lying throughout it.And if you look at the attorney general as well, who's being critical of the FBI and Comey's decision as well, the attorney general has no moral high ground to stand on either because she compromised herself in - in meeting with Bill Clinton and then had to defer to FBI Director Comey entirely throughout this entire thing. And so I think FBI Director Comey is, you know, between a rock and a hard place because what is he supposed to do? He either releases the information now, which is ultimately what he decided to do, or release - the release -WALLACE:  Well, he didn't release the information.BOOTHE: Or, rather, send the letter, or wait until after the - the election. And then how is that going to go? So, I mean, what - there really isn't a good decision for him to make here and it's not like he has a lot of cover when attorney general essentially has laid this entire thing at his feet.WALLACE:  Chuck, there are two, I think it's fair to say, maybe there  are more, but two leading theories inside the beltway right now. One is that Comey is involved in a cover your rear end operation because of all the heat he took when he announced last July that the case was closed, despite his political, not legal, but his political indictment of Clinton. And the other is that there must be something that somebody has read that he thinks is significant enough that he can't ignore it. Where do you come down?CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, I think they could both be true, actually. And I think that I tend to sort of sympathize with the view that the FBI director was kind of, as - as Lisa put it, between a rock and a hard place. Either way he was going to be under a lot of heat. But I think what this speaks to is a broader breakdown in the ordinary institutional processes of our criminal justice system. You are not supposed to be discussing the ongoing investigations publicly. You know - that's just rule one because that can lead to innuendo, smearing of innocent people. It's closely related to the presumption of innocence in our Constitution. And now things have gotten so screwed up that the target of the investigation, Hillary Clinton, is essentially begging to have the ongoing investigation take place in public.This is related to the mistake Loretta Lynch made by - by visiting with the former president. She's now out of the game. So no one in the Justice Department can exercise control over the FBI director. They're saying, well, we told him in a meeting this wasn't a good idea. Why didn't they just say, we order you not to do it? I don't understand that. We have a complete breakdown. And that's something that ought to - if everybody in this country wasn't worried about whether their party was winning or not, that is what is really so disturbing about this whole thing.WALLACE:  All right, we have to take a break here, but when we come back, we'll turn to the political impact of all this, whether the FBI decision will reshape the race just nine days before the election.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Hillary has nobody to blame but herself for her mounting legal troubles. Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful.CLINTON: It's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on the campaign trail this weekend in the wake of the FBI announcement it's found new e-mails relevant to the Clinton investigation.And we're back now with the panel.And the news is breaking while we're on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn't need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development.Let's talk about the politics of all this, because we actually have an election in nine days.Gerry, there was, I think it's fair to say, a growing sense that Hillary Clinton was leading in this election and probably going to win it, but now that's called into question. I want to the put up a new ABC News/Washington Post poll that is out this morning. It shows that this is now a one-point race in a four-person contest. Clinton, 46 percent, Trump, 45 percent. And this was taken this weekend, post-FBI announcement.Let's go to the impact on whether - about supporting for Hillary Clinton, 63 percent say no difference, but 34 percent, that's one in three, say it makes them less likely to support Clinton, and there is a sizable Democratic component in that 34 percent. So the question, Gerry, is, does this sense that Hillary Clinton was sailing to victory here, does that go out the window now?SEIB: Well, look, I think this race was destined to tighten anyway. They always do at the end. I mean you have undecided voters who are starting to drift toward Donald Trump a little bit anyway because if they hadn't decided at this point, they may have already decided not to vote for her. You have some Gary Johnson voters, the libertarian candidate, his support was shrinking. And those people look a lot more like Trump supporters than Clinton supporters. And - and you also have some Republicans coming home, which tends to happen late in the game anyway. So I think there was going to be some tightening. This probably increases the tightening.But you also have to say on the other hand that a lot of the country is already locked in one way or the other and there may actually be a small silver lining for Hillary Clinton that a lot of her voters were getting a little apathetic, it's all over, we won. They're probably more motivated now. So I think in the aggregate it's clearly not good for her. I think the extent that it impacts the race is hard to - it's hard to predict at this point.WALLACE:  Lisa, I - the Clinton e-mail scandal has been going on for literally a year and a half now. And a lot of people, including myself, felt that it had already been priced into the polls. You - we - you - you knew how you felt about it, and that - and that was already reflected in who you were going to vote for. Does the opening - reopening of the FBI investigation change that?BOOTHE: I do, because if you look at polling after FBI Director Comey had given his press conference, 56 percent of voters disapproved of Comey's decision to not recommend an indictment, but 60 percent of independents did as well, including 31 percent of Democrats. So I think there was this general sentiment that she kind of got away with something. But having the cover of having the FBI not recommend an indictment sort of shielded her and protected her from some of that criticism.And now that door is reopened. And if I'm Donald Trump, I'm not going to get into the nuance to much of this because there's still a lot of lingering questions. All he has to say is the fact that we have a candidate for the first time in history facing an FBI investigation.And also, he has been on the campaign trail driving this message of draining the swamp, of corruption in government, running as the outsider. And, you know, what better narrative do you need than this to make that point.And, you know, to Gerry's point, I do think this helps Donald Trump, but it also helps on the down ballot races because now Senate Republicans running in tight races don't have to be on the defense. They get to go on the offense.WALLACE:  Let me pick up on what Gerry was saying, and Lisa. George, does this energize Trump supporters who may have been losing hope, as the polls seem to be going against them? What impact does it have on people who were going to hold their nose, unenthusiastically, and vote for Clinton because of that and now might just stay home? And to pick up on Lisa, what pact does it have on the Republicans trying to hold on to the Senate?WILL: Well, it could well be that by slowing whatever momentum Mrs. Clinton had, it does help the down ballot Republicans. But it does strengthen the fundamental Trump narrative, which is burn it down, blow it up, I'm terrible but who could be worse than the people running Washington? It's the Casey Stengel vote. Let me explain. 1962, the New York Mets are en route to losing a record 120 games. Their manager is Casey Stengel. One day he looks down at his bench and says, can't anyone here play this game? And I think people look at Washington and say, no one there can play the game. And so it strengthens in a sense the perverse Trump message, which is, I may be awful, but I'm - what could be worse than what we've got?WALLACE:  And - and - and why do you think it could have an impact on the Senate races?WILL: Well, because some people can say, well, let's get - let's go out and vote for people for whom we could have some enthusiasm. Maybe - maybe a Senate candidate we like, a gubernatorial candidate.WALLACE:  And I suppose it also adds to the argue, if Clinton is going to be the president, that they need a check on her.LANE: Need a check in place, yes.WALLACE:  Chuck, is this a potential game changer in your mind? And, to get to this question, which I was talking about a little bit with - with Mike Pence, can Trump take advantage of it? Can he stay on script? Lisa said, you know, he's just got to make this point, keep it simple, you've got an FBI - you've got a presidential candidate who's under FBI investigation. Can he stick to that?LANE: In answer to that question I would say, if anybody in politics could blow this, it would be Donald Trump, because he has fumbled away so many other gifts. So, yes, of course it's possible he could fumble it away. But to the first part of your question as to whether or not it's a game changer, I'm going to say a tentative no simply because the polling on this race has been - even though the margin of Hillary's lead has been variable and it's now at a lower ebb, she's never really been behind. Not since the conventions. And I think that as - as you were saying before, the e-mail thing is largely priced in. And as George pointed out, millions of people have already cast their ballots.Having said that, I think what is interesting about this is that Hillary is now trying to actually turn it into an advantage. The way she's talking about it is to cast herself as the victim of this sort of perfidious FBI director and in effect enflame and arouse the Democratic base over this issue.WALLACE:  OK, I was going to - let me pick up on that, because I'm surprised that she decided - she had to address it at some - but she is, as you say, making it a - a kind of, as you say, that she's the victim and - and taking on Comey in a very aggressive way.LANE: And there's - when you really think about it, there's no other play, because in truth the e-mail thing is a mistake. Her own people have admitted it. She's admitted it. The only way to turn this to her advantage at this late date is to present it as sort of a dirty trick. She's not saying that openly, but the - let's face it, there's a lot of conspiracy theorists in the Democratic Party base too, as well as the Republican ones, and she is attempting - and who knows, maybe it'll work - to cast herself as the victim of a dirty trick.WALLACE:  Lisa, final thought?BOOTHE: This is also the FBI director that she had previously praised after he had come - come to - came to his former conclusion and -WALLACE:  Yes, but, come on, the political hypocrisy on both sides is extraordinary here.BOOTHE: Oh, no. Oh, 100 - well, --WALLACE:  The Republicans were - you know, you had Trump saying it's rigged.BOOTHE: OK. Absolutely. I concede that. I mean everyone's a little bit full of it here. But real quick regarding the down ballot. The better Donald Trump does at the top of the ticket, the better those Senate Republicans in tough races are going to do. So that's how it also helps the down ballot.WALLACE:  Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday, two days before the election. Who knows what we'll be talking about then.Up next, from flying papers to pig skins to an FBI bomb shell, it was some week on the trail.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Look at the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of the battlegrounds in this election.Well this week ended with a stunning surprise, but that's not the way it started.
