"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" January 7, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GORDON CHANG, EAST ASIA EXPERT: After Monday's debacle when the circuit breakers, these are the provisions that stop trading losses, once these kicked in, I figured there was going to be calm for at least three or four weeks, a couple months, because Chinese leaders couldn't really stand the volatility. But what happened? You know, on Thursday, today, you know the circuit breakers kick in again, and the reason is because they took their currency, they dropped it lower, and that caused a panic. So this was a panic caused by Chinese officials, and we now have to worry about the competence of Beijing to manage their own economy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, HOST: Well at that closing bell today, the Dow lost 392 points, the worse single-day drop since September 1st. And you can take a look at the rest of the market there. The real big concern here is what happens going forward as China's economy looks to be faltering, and the world is taking its cue from China.What about that in the foreign policy decisions for this administration? Let's bring in the panel live from Washington, syndicated columnist George Will, Ron Fournier, senior political columnist of ""National Journal,"" and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.George, what about this whole thing, China sneezes and everybody catches a cold?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think the world may be a hypochondriac in this case. International trade is about 23 percent of the U.S. GDP, and of that 23 percent, only 16 percent is trade with China. This has an interesting echo in the American presidential contest because the leader for the Republican nomination has for six months been telling the American people that they should live in fear and trepidation about the strength of China. Now the weakness of China seems to be preoccupying us, and Mr. Trump, with his unerring sense of how to make matters worse, has said today what we really need is a 45 percent tariff on imports from China, which would not only raise the cost of living for Americans but would certainly deepen the slowdown in China.This is all very reminiscent of the late 1980s when we were told Japan was at the wheel of the world and we were just going to be passengers in Japan's world from now on. Since then Japan has had decades of stagnation. It's not clear that the China-phobia that we've been urged to have looks quite so scary as it used to.BAIER: Yes, China has problems, Ron. I mean, it's clear.RON FOURNIER, SENIOR POLITICAL COLUMNIST, ""NATIONAL JOURNAL"": They do, but George is exactly right. Who was the leader of Japan is going to take us all over and eat our lunch movement? That was Donald Trump. And George is exactly right that it's not China's strength that is the boogeyman. It's actually the frailty of their economy.The fact of the matter is our stocks were probably a little overpriced. They probably need a correction anyhow, and our economy is relatively stable. Unemployment isn't as low as it should be and our growth isn't as fast as it, or as big as it needs to be. But the fundamentals are certainly much better than China's. And chances are -- most of the people I talk to today think that our stock market is going to snap back. And China has some serious problems that will have a ripple effect for us, but Donald Trump has got this back-you-know-what-wards.BAIER: Charles, take Donald Trump out of this equation and the politics and 2016 out of this, and talk about, you know, this situation in China as it relates to the Obama foreign policy and how it ripples through the world.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, look, the Chinese are our principal rivals in the world. You could say the Russians, but in the longer run the threat is the Chinese.And I agree. The idea has been that the Chinese are overtaking us. You get the Tom Friedmans of the world, I'll leave out Donald Trump here, who come back and rhapsodically speaks of a command economy and the shiny new bullet trains. They have completely overbuilt. Their infrastructure is essentially a weak one. But they have spent enormous amounts of money.They have a command economy, and the model, that was supposed to be the model that would supersede the liberal democratic capitalist model. And it looks as if it's not working that well. In the short run, yes, it's obviously going to hurt our markets, and the Chinese have applied a certain short-term stimulus with this hunger for raw materials and the spike in the price of them. And now that its demand is down, there's a collapse of the raw material prices. But in the longer run, is it not in our interests that our chief rival in the world, expanding as we speak in the South China Sea and developing an enormous military and a sophisticated one, is actually may not be the locomotive that we have been afraid of? So I look at this as good news in the long run, lousy news in the short run.BAIER: All right, Secretary Kerry meantime talking about the Middle East and specifically Iran, saying that this Iran nuclear deal, the compliance with it, could happen within days, which would mean sanction relief for Iran. Take a listen to the secretary today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: The joint comprehensive plan of action from which we are days away from implementation if all goes well. The foreign minister made it clear to me they intend to complete their obligations with respect to implementation day as rapidly as possible. And we are currently engaged ourselves in making certain that we're prepared to move on that day. And I think it could come, without being specific, sooner rather than later.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Now, Iran has shipped in recent days, we're told, as you take a look at the graphic, 25,000 pounds of low enriched uranium to Russia. Interesting inspectors have to verify that Iran's stockpile is below the agreed upon level. Iran has yet to get rid of its supply of uranium enriched to near the 20 percent threshold which was only a step away from weapons-grade material. George, there are Democrats up on the Hill who have a problem with Iran on another front, on their missile testing, on their thumbing their nose at the world.WILL: Missiles, which of course are what at the end of the day make nuclear weapons technology ultimately lethal and a threat to this country, missile technology was just left out of the entire framework of this agreement. We had that statement there that x amount of or all of their nuclear material, their enriched uranium, is being sent. Do we really know and whose word do we have to take for it on this, how much they had? We had the same problem with Assad and the question of him surrendering chemical weapons. And it turns out we didn't know how many he had and he didn't surrender all of them. So we're still in the position of having to trust people we don't know about things we can't confirm.BAIER: All right, Ron and then Charles, quickly, on Iran.FOURNIER: Well, that was always going to be the problem. We can't trust these folks, but we do have to deal with them. And my problem with this is, in addition to missiles, something that was left off the table in the negotiations were our hostages there. We have a reporter, for example, with the ""Washington Post"" who is still sitting in jail after we've cut a deal. And it gets down to, as it does with everything else with this administration, a question of competence and credibility. Even if you support this deal, do you really believe that this administration going to be able to hold our end accountable and make sure that the worst-case scenarios don't come out of this thing?KRAUTHAMMER: Kerry is totally oblivious to the asymmetry here. Once we say that the adherence starts today, that means that we released $150 billion and they have it and it's not going to be reversed. It means the sanctions are lifted. And the Chinese, the Europeans, and others are not going to lift them -- are not going to impose them again. On the other hand, we know that they've been doing the missiles illegally, and we have no idea of knowing what the baseline of their uranium was with this ostentatious shipping of it abroad. If you don't know how much was held in the first place, you have no idea how much it has now. This is the administration hell-bent on doing this, and we will regret it for a generation.BAIER: Charles, Ron, George, and our Brady Bunch panel set-up from Washington, thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

SEAN HANNITY, HOST:  And welcome to ""Hannity.""I want you to pay very close attention to what I'm going to tell you tonight.  We have bombshell revelations from a new round of released e- mails from Wikileaks reportedly from the inbox of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta.  These details are absolutely stunning, and most of the media is not covering this.  We're going to go over it in detail.Now, in 2008, the Clinton campaign appeared to conduct a focus group that tested voters' reactions to various attacks that they may have wanted to use against then senator Barack Obama in the upcoming primary race.  This tells you a lot about the Clintons.  Now, here are the topics they were looking at back then and allegedly testing.Quote, ""Obama is the only candidate at a recent event not to cover his heart during the national anthem and he stopped wearing an American flag pin.""Obama benefited from a land deal from a contributor who's been indicted for corruption.  Obama would personally negotiate with leaders of terrorist nations like Iran and North Korea without preconditions.Wow. Hillary did that, too.Obama voted against allowing people to use handguns to defend themselves against intruders.  Obama planned to raise taxes by $180 billion to pay for his government-run health care plan.  Hillary voted for it.Obama also voted repeatedly against emergency funding bills for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Obama's father was a Muslim and Obama grow up among Muslims in the world's most populous Islamic country.Obama is ranked as one of the 10 most liberal members of the Senate because of his support for issues like gay adoption.  Obama voted against requiring medical care for aborted fetuses who survive that procedure.  Obama supports giving driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.By the way, Hillary supported that, too.Obama described his former use of cocaine as just using a little blow.So here's more proof that the Clinton campaign has been pushing this Muslim narrative all along.  Now, these stunning facts exposed by Wikileaks -- it's only a small portion of what has been uncovered with these released e- mails.Now, we've also learned that what Hillary Clinton tells you, the American people, about her policy positions in public is very different from what she says in private.  Now, you think Clinton would be ashamed to admit that she lies to you, the American people, but no, she actually brags about doing exactly that in a 2013 Wall Street speech where she was paid $225,000.Here are some of her major contradictions.  Now, she says she wants to increase the number of Syrian refugees coming into the country by 550 percent, but the Wikileaks e-mail showed that in a speech in 2013, she admitted that refugees cannot be properly vetted and could put countries they enter at risk.Stop one second!  That means she's willing to gamble with your life!Now, Clinton also claims she wants a no-fly zone in Syria, but it was revealed that she was very skeptical about the idea during a speech she gave to Goldman Sachs.  Despite being a so-called champion, by the way, also of climate change, well, these e-mails reveal that she's unsure about supporting or opposing the Keystone pipeline and also she praised fracking!Well, that's pretty hypocritical.Now, Clinton also pretends that she's a fierce critic of Wall Street and big banks, but as they were paying her again and again and again, she praised their actions after the 2007 financial collapse while she was talking to bankers who were paying her.And contrary to what she says now, in paid speeches, well, Clinton has supported open borders and open trade.  She even wants an open hemisphere, we also discovered.And we discovered, too, that these e-mails -- that Clinton's team -- they actually tried to use the Benghazi terror attack as a distraction from her private e-mail server scandal!Now, think about that?  Who does this?  We're talking about four dead Americans that died in that attack?  And remember, there were 600 requests for extra security, and she didn't send anybody to help them and she wanted use their deaths as a political distraction?  Who acts like that?And speaking of her e-mail scandal, serious red flags are being raised tonight after e-mails released earlier today show that John Podesta e- mailed Clinton aide Cheryl Mills, quote, ""Do you think we should hold e- mails to and from the POTUS,"" meaning the president of the United States. ""Well, that's the heart of his executive privilege.  Now, we can get them to ask for that.  Now, they may not care, but it seems like they probably will.""So it appears now that President Obama did, in fact, know that Clinton used a private e-mail account despite publicly saying to you that he learned about it from press reports, just like we did.  Now, this shows the Clinton server scandal may very well reach the highest level of government.Mr. President, what did you know and when did you know it?Now, to me, this helps prove why Clinton's IT team -- remember they used BleachBit to permanently delete tens of thousands of e-mails instead of wiping it clean with a cloth?  In my opinion, it explains the very suspicious, very questionable actions of the FBI director, James Comey, and the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, and why Bill Clinton, of course, met privately with Lynch on her private plane for nearly 40 minutes just before she rendered her decision.Now, they couldn't bring charges against Clinton or investigate this too much.  Why?  Oh, Obama looks to be directly tied to Hillary's scandal. Now, simply put, for President Obama, this would be the equivalent of Watergate.Plus, Wikileaks also discovered that the campaign was tipped off -- in other words, collusion with the Department of Justice about the release of information about Hillary's private e-mail server.  And on top of that, collusion with the State Department because the State Department gave the campaign a heads-up about when e-mails related to the Democratic nominee would be released to the public!But the revelations don't stop there.  Now, Wikileaks also uncovered more about the inner workings of the Clinton Foundation.  This is interesting. This is pay-to-play.Chelsea Clinton in 2011 raised those questions about corruption, about pay- to-play and those practices going on inside of her family's charity, but her complaints were ignored and she was even viciously attacked for speaking out by one of her father's long-time aides, Doug Band.  Well, he called Chelsea a spoiled brat.Now, keep in mind, as the AP has previously reported, remember, 55 percent of non-governmental people who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state -- they ended up donating or pledging money to the Clinton Foundation!  Is that selling access?Now, ABC news is also reporting that after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti -- remember, 150,000 people died, a reported $10 billion relief aid was being dedicated to that disaster.  At that time, Hillary's State Department gave special treatment to Bill Clinton's friends who may have been looking to cash in.Now, The New York Post editorial board called this, quote, ""the most damning Clinton Foundation story yet.""  They made separate lists of their friends.  Now, the Clinton Foundation, of course, denies this ever happened, but Wikileaks says otherwise.And there's also more.  There's also the blatant hypocrisy of Hillary Clinton and her campaign -- well, they labeled Donald Trump a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe, referring to his supporters, remember, ""basket of deplorable"" that are irredeemable.  Bill Clinton said they're rednecks.Well, the released e-mails show that her campaign attacked and mocked Catholics and evangelicals and that John Podesta, a left-wing activist, he was talking about fomenting revolution within the Catholic Church and it should be infiltrated so they can inject their progressive values into the church!In one e-mail, Podesta used the subject line, quote, ""Needy Latinos,"" one easy call for the needy Latinos.  And they also leaked e-mails from the Democratic National Committee.  Remember, they showed a sleazy plan to post a fake job listing on Craigslist for a Trump company.  The job requirements -- no gaining weight and that you must be open to public humiliation.Also on top of that, there's the issue of liberal mainstream media bias and how it has now become an extension of the Clinton campaign.  Now, since 2008, what have I been telling you?  Journalism in America is dead.  But back then, the press refused to vet Senator Obama, and now we have proof that the abusively biased liberal media is now openly colluding with the Clinton campaign in what is clearly a coordinated effort to put Hillary in the White House.Now, what Wikileaks found is disturbing.  It should be very, very concerning to everybody in this country because in e-mails, we see that CNBC's John Harwood -- remember, he moderated a debate -- he offered advice to the Clinton campaign, praised Hillary and bragged about attacking Trump at a primary debate that he was moderating.A New York Times reporter actually allowed the Clinton campaign to edit out certain quotes from Hillary before the story's published!  By the way, they never let me do that.Also, The Boston Globe launched an effort to try and boost up Hillary Clinton while she was battling Senator Bernie Sanders in the primaries. Also, the head of Univision -- he pushed team Clinton to attack Trump even harder on issues like immigration.And after a trip to Michigan, the Clinton campaign bragged that every single interviewer was for her.  And over at CNN, Donna Brazile, while working there, appears to have shared a question with the Clinton campaign before a town hall on that very network!  Brazile denies it, but the question seems verbatim.Also, there are revelations about how Hillary Clinton and her campaign feel about you, how they really feel about you, the American people.  An e-mail shows that Clinton hated using the term ""everyday Americans"" in speeches. And in prepared remarks, Hillary said she was far removed from the struggles of the middle class because of the fortunes her and Bill now enjoyed because they get $250,000 a speech from big banks and lobbyists and insurance companies and Wall Street firms and much more -- huge, huge, huge revelations!Joining us now with reaction, the author of the brand-new book -- it's out today -- it's called ""Treason,"" former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich.All right, here's what's amazing about this to me.  Number one, you see the dark arts of politics that the Clintons played against Obama.  That's now revealed in Wikileaks.  And on top of that, you've got this collusion, full collusion with the media.  They're an extension of Clinton.Then it's also the State Department.  They're tipping off Clinton, the Justice Department is tipping off Clinton, the White House is helping Clinton with the e-mail server scandal.  And why?  Because Obama, who said he learned about the e-mails like we did from the press, actually was e- mailing the private e-mail.What do you make of all this?  And the media, by the way, all they want to talk about is some woman that made an allegation this late in the game against Donald Trump.NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, look, I think you have to see that the whole thing is the same thing.  You have so much corruption under way now that, you know, you get a million-dollar check from a dictatorship in the Middle East as a birthday gift for Bill Clinton.  Well, in a healthy society, that'd be considered bribery.You get the richest man in Mexico donating millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation while he's also the major stockholder in The New York Times, which just happens to be doing everything it can to protect, you know, Hillary Clinton.HANNITY:  Can I stop you?GINGRICH:  All of this...HANNITY:  The million-dollar check came from Qatar, a country that allows that it's -- marital rape is legal?GINGRICH:  Well, it's also a country which Hillary herself has said was helping support and sustain ISIS.HANNITY:  Yes.GINGRICH:  I mean, one of the things -- the -- you know, Wikileaks, there's so much material there that it's going to take a while for it to sink in. The Wikileaks actually is going to presently give us an entirely new understanding of how sick and how dishonest and how corrupt the left is in all of its mechanisms, the news media, the bureaucracy, the campaign.And at the center of it are the Clintons, and Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt candidate ever to run for the president of the United States.  And you're now seeing detail after detail after detail that's beyond any reasonable question of the depth of their corruption.And what they would bring into the White House -- if you look at how they -- the $10 billion was supposed to go to help the Haitians after the last earthquake, and what do we have happen?HANNITY:  Yes.GINGRICH:  You suddenly had friends of Bill who -- not people who knew Haiti, not people who had particular skills but friends of Bill, people who had donated suddenly got special State Department treatment.This kind of stuff is surfacing now in a way that I suspect the average American over the next week or two is just going to be sickened by the repetitive example...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Do you think it's a coincidence that here we are 25 days out of a campaign, and then all of a sudden out of nowhere, six women come out and make allegations against Donald Trump -- six?  And do you think it's coincidental it's happening right in the middle of a massive document dump that implicates the Clintons?GINGRICH:  Look, if you're the New York Times or CBS News or The Washington Post and you're desperately propping up the most corrupt candidate in history, you're going to reach for anything.I think it's actually funny today that the man who was cited by that first woman of being on the first class flight on the airplane 30 years ago actually came out of the woodwork, turns out to be British, said, Yes, I was sitting across the aisle.  No, she's a total liar.I mean, you know, all -- these things are all going to unravel.  But it gives the media a chance for a few days to try to suppress the Trump voter, and I think it makes the polls highly inaccurate...HANNITY:  Listen...GINGRICH:  ... because you get three or four days like this, a lot of voters are not going the say Donald Trump's name when they're called by a pollster, but they will answer Donald Trump -- this is why Rasmussen is very different from some of the polls because it doesn't require you to tell a person what you're going to do.HANNITY:  That's pretty interesting.  And I like what you're saying.  It took me 10 minutes to outline just the headlines of what is -- there's so much here about collusion with the media, collusion with the State Department, collusion with the Justice Department, and the White House knowing and Obama lied, and they're talking about erasing e-mails that are under subpoena.  There's a lot here.All right, we'll have more with Newt Gingrich right after the break.Also, Wikileaks helped reveal just how much the White House knows about the Clinton server scandal.  What did they know, when did they know it?  Should the case be reopened?  Judge Jeanine Pirro, Kimberly Guilfoyle weigh in later tonight, and more.(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  The media is covering up for the Clintons, and their many crimes against so many people.  The Wikileaks documents shows how the media conspires and collaborates with the Clinton campaign, including giving the questions and answers to Hillary Clinton before the debate, OK?(BOOS)TRUMP:  Last night, we had a massive crowd of over 20,000 people in Cincinnati, filled up an arena.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP:  And the media won't even talk about the size of the crowd, the enthusiasm of the crowd.  The corrupt media is trying to do everything in their power to stop our movement, believe me.  They don't want this happening.Carlos Slim, largest donor (sic) of the paper, from Mexico -- reporters at The New York Times, they're not journalists.  They're corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton.These lies spread by the media without witnesses, without backup or anything else, are poisoning the minds of the electorate!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump earlier today out on the campaign trail going after a very corrupt news media in this country.You know, this really is -- I mean, this is sick.  This is really troubling.  Univision, NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, CNN, The New York Times, The Boston Globe -- I mean, every major media group is basically an extension of the Clinton campaign, and it's revealed.  I've always said journalism is dead.  Now we have the evidence and proof to back up what I've said.But it really puts Donald Trump at a disadvantage.  How should he deal with these allegations that are coming up last minute to smear him and get his message out?  What should the message be?GINGRICH:  First of all, Barry Castleman (ph) wrote a blog this week in which he said this was literally a media coup d'etat.  This was an effort by the media starting last Friday to replace the chosen nominee and destroy the chosen nominee of one of our two major parties.  And it was an all-out effort, virtually a lynching by the news media.Now, I think the way you beat that and the way Ronald Reagan beat it, the way we beat it in 1994, is you take a set of key messages that you know will win in the end.  I was reminded John Engler, with the year he won the governorship against the incumbent governor, the Sunday morning before the election, the Detroit liberal newspaper came out and said that Engler was going to lose by 14 points.  Two days later, he won by 1 point.  It's a 15- point spread.  And of course, they were trying to depress Republicans, get them to decide not to vote, get them to stay home.Trump's got to stay big.  He's got to go right at Hillary as the most corrupt candidate in history.  He's got to go right at Carlos Slim, the amount of money the various Slim organizations have given, paid (ph) in speeches given to the Foundation, the relationship of Slim and The New York Times.And I love it when the head of The New York Times explains, Oh, but there's no real relationship.  Right.  The richest guy in Mexico, who is your biggest single stockholder, has no real effect on you.  Give me a break! The level of dishonesty is breathtaking.And I think you see it in The Washington Post...HANNITY:  But...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... by himself.  You and I are the only ones that will tell the story.GINGRICH:  Well, I think what Trump -- listen, the thing that makes Trump so remarkable is if he stays at the level he was at this afternoon, if he hammers home the facts, if they, as they did last night when they took on Hillary for her Brazilian secret speech, where she said she really wanted a hemisphere without borders, and Trump took her head on and said, Look, that means 600 million people could come in the U.S.HANNITY:  Yes.GINGRICH:  That means Mexican drug dealers, you know, Colombian cocaine dealers...HANNITY:  It's insane.GINGRICH:  ... MS-13 from El Salvador could all come just -- when you -- when you get that message out there, and between social media, the giant rallies he has -- remember, you get 20,000 people at a rally, you have 20,000 people on Facebook.  You have 20,000 people on Instagram.HANNITY:  It's a good point.GINGRICH:  I mean, I've been at these rallies.  So he creates his own mini- network everywhere he goes, and it's much more than just the people in the room.  It's all of their electronic connections.HANNITY:  All right, Mr. Speaker...GINGRICH:  The message is very simple.  Are you going to let a corrupt media decide the fate of your country?HANNITY:  It's a profound, deep question.  And there's a lot of work to do after this.  By the way, you and Callista...GINGRICH:   But I have to end on a happy note.  This is the first event on television ever of Ellis the elephant, the plush toy version.HANNITY:  Yes, by the way, tomorrow...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... you're going to be at Barnes & Noble in Fairfax, Virginia, what time tomorrow?GINGRICH:  We'll be there at 1:00 o'clock, and Callista and I will both be there.  And the real Ellis the elephant will be there also for pictures with kids.HANNITY:  All right...GINGRICH:  So it'll be a lot of fun.HANNITY:  And next week, you're at the Nixon and Reagan libraries, if people want to see you there.GINGRICH:  We sure are.HANNITY:  Are you going to the -- are you going to be in Vegas?GINGRICH:  No, I'm doing a -- actually, I'm doing a debate watch party in Los Angeles and then catching a red eye to go see my grandchildren.HANNITY:  All right, Mr. Speaker, thank you -- 25 days to go.GINGRICH:  Good to see you.HANNITY:  All right.Coming up -- in the wake of the damning new revelations exposed by Wikileaks, should the case on Clinton's private e-mail server now be reopened?  Yes, it should!  Judge Jeanine Pirro, Kimberly Guilfoyle are next.And later, former governor Mike Huckabee and Dr. Ben Carson are here, as we continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Wikileaks released new Clinton campaign e-mails revealing how friendly Hillary was with the attorney general, Loretta Lynch.  This was only months prior to Lynch's investigation of Hillary's illegal secret e-mail server that gave foreign governments access to our confidential information.This comes on the heels of disclosure that Clinton campaign was conspiring and colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the release of her e-mails and the investigation into her server.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump earlier today talking about the new Wikileaks revelations related to Hillary Clinton's server scandal.  Now, among them was an e-mail from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, to Clinton aide Cheryl Mills.  Now, Podesta discussed Hillary's server scandal, asking, quote, ""Well, you think we should hold e-mails to and from the POTUS,"" president of the United States.  ""Well, that's the heart of the executive privilege or his executive privilege.  We could get them to ask for that.  Now, they may not care, but it seems like they will.""Here with reaction, the co-host of ""The Five"" Kimberly Guilfoyle, the host of ""Justice,"" Judge Jeanine Pirro.OK, we got to slow down here because we got collusion.  We know that the State Department contacted Hillary's campaign, gave them a heads-up.  We know that the Justice Department gave Hillary's campaign a heads-up.  We know now that the White House was actively involved because the president who said he learned about the e-mails in the press ended up getting e-mails to and from Hillary.Now, I would say because of everyone's involvement, we need an outside investigator.  We need a grand jury impanelled.  And there is a possibility, first of all, that if they destroyed those e-mails and they were under subpoena, that's a crime.  It's called obstruction of justice. She could get elected and be impeached within days.  True or false?JEANINE PIRRO, ""JUSTICE"" HOST:  Well, you're right.  She could get elected and be impeached.  But here's the problem.  You've got the Clintons, who have their tentacles all over.  This is a textbook example of collusion, corruption and banana republic! You've got the Department of Justice, the FBI, the State Department, as well as...HANNITY:  And the White House...PIRRO:  ... and the White House...HANNITY:  All in collusion!PIRRO:  ... (INAUDIBLE) agreement just to make sure that Hillary gets in! I mean, the deal is everybody is in on the deal except for the American people!  You can get the Justice Department or a special prosecutor with grand jury powers to start all over.  But here's the problem.  Jim Comey destroyed some of the evidence!  Jim Comey allowed for the destruction of some of the evidence...HANNITY:  It makes you wonder what they have on Jim Comey.PIRRO:  Well, you know what?  It makes you wonder...HANNITY:  Sorry, because his actions don't make any sense!PIRRO:  I agree!  I know him to be a different man, but I am terribly disappointed!HANNITY:  You think there's a possibility they may have something on him.PIRRO:  I don't know what they did to him or why he did what he did, but it's contrary to the law!HANNITY:  All right, but here -- we're in the middle of an investigation. Why would the Justice Department be talking to the Clinton campaign?  Is there any justifiable reason, just like any justifiable reason Bill Clinton got on a plane for 40 minutes with Loretta Lynch?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST:  No!  The impropriety of it, the lack of ethics and morality -- I mean, this is a big problem!  And now here you have the proof is in the pudding in these e-mails to show the collusion, to show the desire to obstruct justice, to perpetrate a fraud upon the American people!  It is outrageous!  We're both former prosecutors, and when you see something like this, it really shocks the conscience!  And by the way...HANNITY:  So we know Obama lied...GUILFOYLE:  ... may take the most important office in the world, the presidency of the United States!HANNITY:  I want to dig deeper into this because we know Obama lied when he told the American people, Oh, I just learned about it in the press, like all of you.PIRRO:  Yes!HANNITY:  That was a lie.  OK.  So now we have an issue -- if that evidence was subpoenaed, the e-mails, and John Podesta and Cheryl Mills are conspiring to erase them and get rid of them, and he's invoking executive privilege as a means of getting out from under this cloud -- what did the president know and when did he know it?PIRRO:  That's exactly the problem because you've got this coverup -- and generally, the coverup is worse than the crime itself.  You've got the president saying he had no idea that she had this private server and...HANNITY:  And -- and he's e-mailing her on it!PIRRO:  And he's e-mailing her on it.  And I said right from the beginning, the reason there were no charges by Comey is because the first witness for Hillary for the defense would be President Barack Obama because he was communicating with her on a private server less secure that Google.  HANNITY:  So did Obama influence his attorney general --PIRRO:  Of course he did.  HANNITY:  And his State Department --PIRRO:  Of course he did.  HANNITY:  OK, but that is against the law.  PIRRO:  No kidding.  But if you listen to Loretta Lynch you think she's made an independent decision in her life?  HANNITY:  No.  PIRRO:  When she meets with Bill Clinton on an airplane and then two days later Hillary Clinton says if I become president I'm going to appoint her attorney general, this is a banana republic and we're the stooges in it.  KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, FOX NEWS CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"":  It's the way the Clintons do business.  It's the way Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation -- and by the way, they were passing out immunity to like party favors to everybody, including Cheryl Mills who was also advising Hillary at the time.  HANNITY:  So basically they did it to shut the case down.  GUILFOYLE:  Right.  And you have to ask a judge, too, to set aside perhaps.  HANNITY:  Isn't it given specific information that you're going to hand over, so there may still be some opening somewhere.  But I'm assuring they probably dotted their i's and crossed their t's here.  PIRRO:  The proper agreement is only issued by the Department of Justice when the person making the proffer is offering evidence of a crime. Otherwise there's no point of giving immunity.  HANNITY:  Why would the FBI ever agree as part of the deal to destroy evidence?  PIRRO:  Because they wanted to get rid of it pure and simple.  Sometimes the most simple answers are the ones that first come to mind.  GUILFOYLE:  Common sense.  HANNITY:  What they didn't count on is that WikiLeaks --PIRRO:  Julian Assange.  GUILFOYLE:  That was the unknown variable that came forth that will haunt them.  And the problem is we're real close to the election here and there's a strong likelihood she could be the next president.  Now what?  HANNITY:  Impeach her.  PIRRO:  They knew WikiLeaks was coming out which is why they say it's all the Trump stuff.  They knew they were in deep trouble and they said let's hold all it.  HANNITY:  So that's where the woman come from.  GUILFOYLE:  You wonder while these allegations weren't brought forward and also why the media was complacent in holds things like the tape, to bring if forth for maximum impact.  HANNITY:  By the way, between the two of you, you guys got a lot of bling. I'm noticing your earrings.  GUILFOYLE:  She's got the good stuff.  HANNITY:  I am totally like --PIRRO:  Don't even go there.  HANNITY:  I don't wear jewelry at all.  I don't even have a ring.  I don't have nothing.  GUILFOYLE:  You got something better.  HANNITY:  Coming up next tonight on ""Hannity.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, D-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If I watched Fox News I wouldn't vote for me.  (LAUGHTER)OBAMA:  I understand.  If I was listening to Rush Limbaugh, I would say, man, it's terrible.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Is Obama back out there campaigning for Hillary Clinton and attacking talk radio, conservatives, Fox News?  Big shock.  Former governor Mike Huckabee and Dr. Ben Carson will weigh in as we continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So President Obama was out campaigning for Hillary Clinton yesterday.  Instead of talking about her record, he began criticizing Republicans, talk radio, Fox News.  Back to the same old, same old.  Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA:  Some of these folks on talk radio started talking about how I was the anti-Christ.  This is in the swamp of crazy.  Look, if I watched Fox News I wouldn't vote for me.  (LAUGHTER)OBAMA:  I understand.  If I was listening to Rush Limbaugh, I would say man, this is terrible.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Joining us now, two former 2016 GOP presidential candidates, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Dr. Ben Carson.  With all the revelations, Governor Huckabee, with the collusion with the Clinton campaign and the White House, the collusion with the State Department, the collusion with the Justice Department, doesn't it seem odd, the timing, all the women in one day right in the middle of the WikiLeaks dump that show all of this, that show that even the president lied to us about when he got e-mails from Hillary?  MIKE HUCKABEE, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You know, it's not surprising to me, Sean, because this is exactly what I experienced in Arkansas at the hands of the Clinton political machine every time I was on the ballot. Within weeks, usually sometimes days of the election, there would be all manner of the craziest stuff imaginable being thrown, even lawsuits filed. Everything you can imagine and more to give the press something to talk about and write about other than the issues of the election.  So it looks very familiar to me.  I've not only seen it, I've been there in the middle of it before, and not the least bit surprised by it.  Let me just say this.  So far we can't verify a lot of these allegations, but let me tell you what we can verify.  We can verify that if Hillary is elected we have a good shot of losing religious liberty, the Second Amendment, the fourth and the fifth, having opener borders, leaving -- to blow in the wind.  We can verify that this country is going to take a very, very negative direction, and that's what we need to be focused on.  HANNITY:  And Dr. Carson, when you look at the collusion with the media, the media seems -- they're not paying attention to some of the most profound things that have been revealed here, the propaganda efforts, the lying efforts, the collusion that has gone on here.  You know, they just want the talk about the new allegations while simultaneously ignoring Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Willey and Kathy Shelton who I interviewed last night.  So it shows that everything we learned in WikiLeaks about NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, MSNBC, ""The New York Times,"" ""The Boston Globe"" is all true, that they're in bed with the Clintons.  So the Clintons now want them to talk about the women that make allegations but only against Trump and ignore WikiLeaks.  They're just taking orders from the Clintons, it seems.  BEN CARSON, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It does seem that way. It's so predictable.  And, you know, a week or two ago I predicted that exactly this would happen.  I said that the tape was not going to be the last thing.  There would be another thing the next week and another thing the next week, because that's what they do, because they don't want to discuss the issues.  I mean, wouldn't it be refreshing to have an open and honest discussion between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump about why he wants to lower taxes and why she wants to raise them.  Explain the rationale behind that.  Why he wants to secure the borders, why she wants to have open borders.  I think it would be a fascinating discussion, and the American people deserve to know the differences.  We're not giving it to them.  HANNITY:  You know, governor, when you look at the media and that establishment for Hillary, and that's now confirmed, CNN feeding questions to Hillary, MSNBC being fed questions to ask Hillary in a lead up to an election.  And then you've got the Republican establishment, they're weak, they cut and run and they never liked the insurgency of Donald Trump.  Then you've got the Democratic establishment, it's like everybody is against him.  Then you see the poll numbers the way they are, Hillary in the lead in the polls, do you think Donald Trump has a fair shot of winning this at this point 25 days out?  HUCKABEE:  I do think he's got to start focusing solely on the issues that pack those rallies out with the tens of thousands.  He can't let himself take the bait and respond to all these allegations because then he spends too much time, just gives more attention, and he validates a lot of the accusations.  So my advice, focus on the fact of the contrast between Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and it's major.  It's significant.  And by the way, I have to comment, when Barack Obama said that if everybody had listened to FOX knees he wouldn't have been elected, that proves right there that people should have been watching FOX News and not all of the other stuff and maybe we wouldn't have had the past eight years with a totally broken economy.  HANNITY:  All right, guys, thank you both for being with us, 25 day to go.  When we come back, first lady Michelle Obama, she's hitting the campaign trail hard for Hillary Clinton, but the Obamas and Clintons, they've not always been friends.  We'll explain that in more detail as ""Hannity"" continues.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA, U.S. FIRST LADY:  People who are truly strong lift others up.  People who are truly powerful bring others together.  And that is what we need in our next president.  We need someone who is a uniting force in this country.  We need someone who will heal the wounds that divide us, someone who truly cares about us and our children, someone with the strength and compassion to lead this country forward.  And let me tell you, I'm here because I believe with all of my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  That is first lady Michelle Obama praising Hillary Clinton at a campaign event yesterday.  But back in 2007, when then Senator Obama was locked in a primary fight with Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama was singing a very different tune.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA:  One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role-modeling what good families should look like.  And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House, can't do it.  (APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Now, I wonder what the first lady thinks after today's WikiLeaks document dump a little bit differently.  As we revealed earlier in the show, the Clinton campaign back in 08 appeared set on pushing a narrative that Obama's father was a Muslim, and they also wanted to bring up the fact that he liked to do blow, cocaine use.  Joining us now, radio talk show host Rose Tennent, the author of ""Government Gone Wild"" Kristin Tate is back with us.  So let's go over some of this.  Kristin, good to see you, by the way.  KRISTIN TATE, ""GOVERNMENT GONE WILD"" AUTHOR:  Good to see you.  Thank you, Sean.  HANNITY:  So, we know that back in 08 that they were focusing on the fact he wouldn't put his hand over his heart or wear a flag pin.  The Clinton campaign was saying he would negotiate with terrorist nations like Iran and North Korea, that he voted against the use of handguns for people to defend themselves, that he was going to raise taxes by $180 billion to pay for Obamacare, that his father was a Muslim, and Obama grew up among Muslims, and he's one of the most liberal senators in the Senate, and it goes on from there, and he did a little blow.  TATE:  These Democrats are flagrant hypocrites.  But you know what, Michelle Obama is going to get up there, she's going to put her acting shoes on and bring out her upset voice to express how horrified she is at politics and Republicans need to get used to it.  Trump's biggest foe right now isn't Michelle Obama.  It's not Hillary. It's not even the media.  It's the GOP establishment.  Say what you will about the Democrats, they are very good and coming together when they need to win elections.  HANNITY:  They fight.TATE:  They come together though when they need to.Meanwhile, the GOP is throwing the only candidate who can beat Hillary Clinton under the bus.  Look at Hillary's most effective ads.  It's all other Republicans slandering Trump.  And these establishment pukes think they're such angels for walking away from their candidate.  HANNITY:  You sound like me.  You've got talk radio in your future, no doubt about it.  (LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  Rose, let me bring you into this.  ROSE TENNENT, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  She does.  She does.  HANNITY:  But you know something, they don't like each other.  TENNENT:  They never did.  HANNITY:  Michelle Obama is so outraged over Donald Trump's tape you would think maybe she thought, no, not that well-loved.  Let's see, Paula and Juanita and Kathleen and Kathy Shelton.  TENNENT:  I'm sure Michelle Obama dreads getting up every day and doing the job she's got to do.  I know Ed Klein has been telling me for years how much the Clintons are despised and disliked by the Obamas.  But you know what, Sean, something Kirsten said.  She's right, the real enemy is the GOP, I wouldn't disagree with here at all.  But I'd like to remind everyone that the movie they're watching play out right now with the parade of women that the left and the media is bringing out happened before.  If you remember, Herman Caine, who was this black conservative that people really, really liked, he was wowing crowds, he was so dynamic in his speeches, so inspirational.  I was at quite a few rallies with him.   The people were falling in love with him.  He could eat Obama for lunch in a debate.  And that scared the left.  So what did they do?  They brought out blonde bombshell from Chicago, Gloria Allred.  HANNITY:  Let me ask you this.  How did -- they do this, five women just in the middle of a WikiLeaks dumps.  TENNENT:  Right.  HANNITY:  So here we are 20 days out, let's just dump five women on them so that's all the media is going to focus on, not what we're focusing on.   TATE:  The timing of all this is very suspicious, but it's just a ploy to deflect people's attention away from the issues, away from Hillary's scandals.  HANNITY:  Will this work?  TATE:  It has so far.  The media has been reporting on this stuff nonstop. And the GOP is just making it worse.  What is Paul Ryan doing?  He's spending time trashing Trump.  The GOP elite say they hate Trump.  They created Trump.  They were in the Congress.  They gave Obama everything he wanted.  There was no pushback.  Now the voters are fed up.   HANNITY:  Rose, last word.  TENNENT:  Well, you know what, I'd like to say that I don't think it's going to work.  They're trying the same play from the same playbook, and it's not going to work this time, not with Donald Trump.  It just won't.  And I'll tell you something else.  As long as Donald Trump stays on the offense and doesn't go to defense, he can win this.  That is what he did at the debate when he came off the debate and showed up in his rallies, people were going crazy.  That is what he needs to do, stay on the offense.  HANNITY:  Good to see you both, appreciate it.  TENNENT:  Good to see you, too.  TATE:  Thank you.HANNITY:  When we come back, we need your help, a very important ""Question of the Day"" straight ahead.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  All right, time for our ""Question of the Day."" So why is the media not spending more time covering the WikiLeaks e-mails?  Well, it's pretty obvious, right?  Just go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, these media people here, you know why, because they want Hillary to win.  Simple answer.  Anyway, also on Twitter -- you want to come on debate? @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.Quick programming note.  Tune in Monday night.  We'll be in Las Vegas ahead of Wednesday's third and final presidential debate.  That's all the time we have left this evening.  As always thank you for being with us.  Hope you have a great weekend.  Let's see if a liberal can catch.  Are you ready?  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

First off, Congresswoman, this isn't about cutting pay for police or firefighters.Stick to the topic. This is for cutting the budget at an agency now under fire.Its agents running amok.Tens of thousands of them not even doing IRS work, but union work, on our dime.I say cut the dimes. A lot of dimes. And do it now.Because if the IRS can do all this nonsense on a 13 billion dollar budget I'm sure it can do quite nicely the same nonsense just hopefully less nonsense on a 10 billion dollar budget.

Do Republicans really 'lower the bar' for African-Americans?	" This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" May 12, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: South Carolina Senator Tim Scott under attack again. Everyone is talking about a new ""Bloomberg"" opinion column, titled, ""Do Republicans Lower the Bar for Blacks""? Some people have been blasting the article for calling Senator Scott nothing more than an affirmative action token. Is that fair?The author of the piece, Francis Wilkinson, joins us. Good evening, sir.FRANCIS WILKINSON, COLUMNIST, ""BLOOMBERG"": Hi. How are you doing?VAN SUSTEREN: And I should add that it wasn't you that had the token in the headline. But as everything goes viral, you write the story and then the next story has -- is calling Senator Scott a token. But nonetheless, your article was rather harsh on Senator Scott. Why?WILKINSON: Actually, it wasn't harsh on Senator Scott and it wasn't terrifically about Senator Scott. Ambassador Bolton was on earlier talking about the difficulties of identity politics. And that's something that Republicans haven't really dealt with too much. It hasn't been a problem for them. But as the party diversifies, which I think most people certainly in the Republican leadership agree that it needs to do, they will face some difficult issues. What I have decided to do was to look at the case of Senator Scott and see whether -- it was almost like intellectual exercise -- if it were in the parties' favor to sort of close out a primary and help him win, would think do that on the basis of race? After looking at it, I concluded that not only that would make sense for them to do that but they should do it.VAN SUSTEREN: How do figure that they did it on the basis of race?(CROSSTALK)WILKINSON: -- Greta. That's not what I'm saying.VAN SUSTEREN: OK.WILKINSON: You have to understand, this has been sort of blown out of proportion, as things do when you combine the Internet plus racial politics and speculation. I suppose some people should think I get what I deserve. But what I was saying was, look, here's an appointed Senator. The history of appointed Senators is not terrifically successful.One in five Senators appointed over the last 100 years or so, when they run in the primaries, they lose. He was appointed by a governor who is not particularly popular herself. And there's been a lot of primaries in the republic party recently. Most of those have occurred from the right with Tea Party candidates running across so-called mainstream conservatives. I wanted to look at the idea that maybe it would be in the Republican Party's interest as some point to do what they do in lots of instances, and frankly what the Democratic Party does in lots of instances, which is to clear the field for a preferred candidate.VAN SUSTEREN: And I was looking at the idea who is running for primaries down in South Carolina. Senator Lindsey Graham is also up for election in November. He drew a whole field of primary challengers, which Senator Scott did. One of the reasons I think probably Senator Lindsey Graham did this, because he has a 38.9 percent disapproval rate, whereas Senator Tim Scott has only a 17.6 percent. If I were going to choose to run against one of them, I would choose to run against the one with the lousier approval rating.WILKINSON: I'm not so sure I would. Senator Scott is not very well-known.VAN SUSTEREN: Well he is popular. Anyway, I guess -- and one of the other things I thought -- and we only have 30 seconds left -- if that I read your article. Then the next article after it, says ""Bloomberg,"" writer attacks Tim Scott as an affirmative action token. Token is so insulting. That wasn't your title.WILKINSON: No.VAN SUSTEREN: But that's the problem when we have a lot of these discussions, is that you start with one and may want to have a good discussion about it, but it certainly gets explosive and sometimes not in a way that generates a good debate or discussion.WILKINSON: I couldn't agree with you more.VAN SUSTEREN: Thank you for joining us.WILKINSON: Thank you."
