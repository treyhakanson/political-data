IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.FORMER HHS SECRETARY SEBELIUS: FINANCIAL LITERACY OF A LOT OF PEOPLE IS VERY LOWJOHN TAMNY: Sebelius is 100 percent incorrect. If markets are smart and I think we agree they are, then so by definition is the electorate because it comprises all known information. The electorate is very financially literate.MIKE OZANIAN: I think Sebelius has a very good point. For instance I think most Americans could not explain why things that are normally not covered by insurance, like Lasik surgery or dental implants, have gone down dramatically in price because of the free market.STEVE FORBES: They don't like it because it doesn't deliver. In free markets you don't have to be an expert. You don't have to be an expert engineer to drive a car or a nerd to be able to function with an IPhone or an iPad, and so to it should be with health insurance. The problem is the system not the American people.CARRIE SHEFFIELD: I completely agree it's a bad law but I have to challenge John for example, because the American people reelected Barack Obama in 2012, even though we knew how bad this law was. The broader point of financial literacy in this country, only six states actually require the testing of personal finance. So I mean it's no wonder. We make you learn pi r 2 but not actually how to balance a checkbook.RICH KARLGAARD: There's a streak of left wing progressivism. I guess it started with Woodrow Wilson, I don't know, who is a university president. You know that just relishes in the idea that the rest of us are stupid. I don't know how America became the greatest nation that has ever existed.SABRINA SCHAEFFER: I wish I could stay as calm as others on this panel. When I heard Sebelius' comments I literally think I felt my blood hit the boiling point. I was so incensed by the contempt that she has for the American people.FORBES FLIPSIDE: WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HARD TURN TO THE LEFT AFTER THE ELECTION COULD BE A GREAT THING FOR AMERICARICH KARLGAARD: It's not just president Obama. Look at how he's dragged Hilary Clinton to the left. Hilary Clinton said that businesses and corporations do not create jobs. So this leaves a huge gap for a pro-business.RICK UNGAR: As much as you don't want to ever say or believe it, this is a pro-business president. Just look at Wall Street, are they complaining? I don't think so.STEVE FORBES: No he's anti-business. The fact of the matter is even when we create jobs in this economy, sixth year into recovery finally doing that, the wages in this country are still stagnant or going down. And this guy is doing everything; regulations. Now the EPA is starting to wage war on farmers for crying out loud, we're not going to eat?ELIZABETH MACDONALD: I just got done reading John F. Kennedy's speech he was supposed to give on the day he was assassinated at the Dallas Trade mart, and guess what he was fighting for until the very end? A corporate and personal tax cut. He said that he basically applauded beating western Europe as corporate profits rose 43 percent over the prior three years. And after tax corporate profits were going up. So he was fighting until the very end for tax cuts.JOHN TAMNY: I think he's just fighting for relevancy and for attention when he's no longer getting it. Let's be fair, his presidency essentially ended at the end of 2012. That's one reason the economy is starting to grow. We've got gridlock. Ultimately I think it's going to help Republicans because voters don't buy anything that's he's doing. What do we need from Republicans? Not a pro-business president, a president whose pro economic freedom and you will get business growth if you achieve that.REPORT: CONVICTED DOMESTIC TERRORIST CLEARED TO TEACH AT US COLLEGESTEVE FORBES: It is unreal and also shows hypocrisy. Can you imagine a Ku Klux Klanner who murdered an innocent person being hired by the University of Illinois? No way. But left wing terrorist murderer, oh that's okay. So the business man is right and the University of Illinois has to understand that if they want to do this kind of nonsense where academic integrity goes out the window and politics is in, there are consequences for it.RICK UNGAR: Yeah it's a weird one. The businessman should do whatever he wants and I don't think that should have an impact on what the school does. I'd like to be able to say that the school should pursue whatever course they think is right but Steve makes a point that I just don't know how to argue with. We would react differently; the school would not hire that person that Steve suggested.ELIZABETH MACDONALD: Do parents really want their tuition costs going to guys like these? Today you can't even say the word Regan on college campuses, and you look like a lunatic.MIKE OZANIAN: Personally I agree with what the business man is doing. But I think E Mac touched on the main point here. If people object to this then don't go to the school. That's the best way to cast your vote.SABRINA SCHAEFFER: We want a diversity of opinion on college campuses; I don't want to get rid of all liberals the same way I don't want to get rid of all conservatives. The problem is that some of these universities are so steeped in their liberal ideology that they don't even see a problem with this."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Geraldo Rivera, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five."" Donald Trump's campaign steps up its congressional outreach today, holding the first in a series of meetings of lawmakers to help him win the nomination. The front- runner, excuse me, meanwhile is continuing to rail against the rules he says were changed to keep him from becoming the nominee.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HEATHER NAUERT, FOX NEWS: For example, the rules were clearly established ahead of time. So when people say that the rules are the rules, how do you respond?DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I respond by saying they changed the rules. You know after I got in, they changed the rules. I joined and then they changed the rules and they took it away from the voters, because I would have won in Colorado.NAUERT: Do you think they did that because of you?TRUMP: I think so, yeah, I think so, because they saw that I do very well in Colorado, so I think so. Look, it's a crooked system, but what are you going to do? In the meantime, I'm winning.NAUERT: But the former head of the RNC said that you were at war with the GOP. Are you?TRUMP: I'm not at war, but I want to make it really a process where the votes count.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Ted Cruz dismisses Trump's allegations and points out the establishment are not behind him either.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Anyone that knows anything about Washington knows that the establishment is not rooting for me. That they have been battling me every day I've been in the Senate. But the rules are simple. The way you get elected is that you win a majority of the delegates in elections. What Donald is unhappy about is in the last three weeks, there have been a total of 11 elections in four states and we've beaten Donald in all 11 elections. He is unhappy about that because he is losing at the polls. And so I guess he thinks what he should do is just complain and attack the voters. I think the way you win is make the case to the voters and earn their votes.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: OK, I'll start with you Eric. The --- I was thinking today about Colorado -- you know I grew up there; that was a reliably republican state, my whole growing up, and then they voted twice for President Obama. So it is now considered a blue state, maybe kind of purple. Any republican, whoever it is, they need to win Colorado because they have to flip those states so that they can get to the 270 Electoral College votes. I don't think Colorado is going to change anything that happened and I would hope if Trump is thinking that he wants to win Colorado, it is probably best to set that aside, move forward and get a better operation there than he has.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Yeah. And I think what Trump was pointing out, first of all again, I said this yesterday, I don't think he is right about the individual states rigging the game against Donald Trump. I think the rigging is when you take the aggregate, when you go to the RNC and the establishment, or the RNC rules committee has the ability to change the rules late in the game, and basically put in who they want. You wonder who the delegates are gonna be on the rules committee, there were two. I pointed the one out yesterday who said if Trump gets 1100, he is going to be the nominee. I'm not sure that's the case. And there's one Curly Haugland, a couple of weeks ago saying, well, the misinformation by the media is that voters think they're the ones picking the delegate -- the nominee. They're not. It's the delegates. That's a problem. The process is a problem, because the voters aren't. In Colorado, whenever they did it, October or November, whenever that was, they took the vote away from the people of Colorado and said, these are the delegates, we're going to elect these delegates from a group of around, I think 600 or 800. And all that, they whittled it down to 33 or 34, and they were gonna represent the whole state of Colorado, rather than the people of Colorado voting. I think the people of Colorado, republican people of Colorado would like to have their vote count for something, and I think that's what Trump was pointing out. And I would tend on agree with it, but again, after the fact, it's too late to be complaining about it.PERINO: We don't need to go in all the details of Colorado. I actually understand the process a little bit differently than that. And also, I would say that when the Colorado changed its position, it was August. It was at seen as the review to Republican National Committee, to the very establishment that everyone is complaining about. But Kimberly, let me go to you this -- bypass Colorado, unless you want to talk more about Colorado.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: I'm good.PERINO: What do you think about the other news that Trump is going to be in Washington meeting with congressional members, seeing if he can gin up some support on that side?GUILFOYLE: Sounds like a good idea to me. It sounds like something that's putting forward a strategy, maybe from some of the new people that he's brought on board that is saying we need to kind of reach out and make sure that they're olive branches instead of fire sticks poking at everyone. So, I think that's good. I want to see the party come together and support the person that, you know, ultimately should get the nomination and has the most delegates and should move forward. So let's see what happens with that. I think they need to do a little bit more of that outreach and perhaps, this is the first steps.PERINO: All right, Greg, what do you think about the strategy going forward?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Do you know what he's like? He is like, you know when you go to the gym for the first time and you don't talk to anybody, and you start using the machines but you really don't know how to use them? And you end up hurting yourself? Trump finally figure that after being at the gym for a few months, maybe hire a personal trainer. Maybe go to Washington and have somebody go, OK, look --PERINO: It makes it more efficient.GUTFELD: It makes it more efficient and now you can do the arm curls, because that's what I do. I was screw up because I never actually go talk to somebody. So I think it's good. But I just have to go back to what Cruz said. You know, I hate -- this will be the second --GERALDO RIVERA, CO-HOST: I'd like to picture you on the gym.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: I have pictures of me in the gym, Geraldo.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Would you like to see them? I was the editor of Men's Health, young man.GUILFOYLE: Was this your gym at D.C. reps?GUTFELD: Yeah. I was -- it was house of reps.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Yeah.RIVERA: As he was lying in down the corner.GUTFELD: That's -- this is the second day I will compliment Ted Cruz, which is like unbelievable. Because I -- he just to drive me crazy, but he, he was right. He did get no help from anyone. He really --GUILFOYLE: True.GUTFELD: He was -- he had to get buy on his personality, Eric. And you know his personality.BOLLING: And no, no. And we talked about that quite a bit. But now, clearly, just -- I mean, from him to say the establishment is not in his corner. They are. Lindsey Graham said he wouldn't, he wouldn't pull the plug -- put the plug back in on the --GUTFELD: He would pull the plug on.BOLLING: Yeah, he pulls the plug. He wouldn't put the plug back in if the plug came out, it's where you basically say the people on the set forward let him go.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: The establishment wants to get a -- keep Donald Trump from getting 1237, so that they can, they can do what they're going to do with the rules committee. And we don't really know what they're going to do. They say they're going --GUTFELD: I don't think they have to do anything with the rules committee. They -- the rules are there.BOLLING: Well, if the rules stay the same.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: John Kasich can't be in there, Marco Rubio can't be and if Jeb Bush -- if they stay the same.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: Because they didn't win eight states.BOLLING: Because they didn't win eight states.RIVERA: I want to know something more basic, and I want to go back to where you started Dana. I know rules are rules, but what about one man one vote? Why -- what is with it this caucus system anyway?PERINO: What about representational government?GUTFELD: Yes. Should we get rid of the Senate and Congress?RIVERA: Why not have primaries? Why can't we have a primary?PERINO: Why get rid of the Electoral College?RIVERA: I'm a member of the Republican Party in New York State, I will be voting next Tuesday in the primary. It is a simple process, an honest process, nobody can deny my vote. In Colorado, on the other hand, I am confident Dana, the people you grew up with had no say in that process at all, but selected Ted Cruz that -- and Ted Cruz getting 34 --GUTFELD: They knew --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: Ted Cruz getting 34 of the electoral --GUTFELD: Sixty thousand people.RIVERA: of the 34 of the delegates, out of 34. Is that the will of the republican electorate in the state of Colorado, I dare to say this is not.PERINO: This is a party process of the party gets together. The party that dominate --RIVERA: The party stinks. The party stinks.PERINO: That --GUTFELD: It stinks to everyone then.PERINO: You can have that opinion, but that is at page (ph) --RIVERA: But you have --GUTFELD: But the only person who can (inaudible) was Trump, because he's winning.RIVERA: He's failed to understand that most people think that.GUILFOYLE: Unicorn, do well.RIVERA: . the organized political system stinks. You missed the attraction of Sanders.BOLLING: Can I --RIVERA: . and the attraction of Trump.BOLLING: Can I add one thing to this? So we've talked about this quite a bit. And people come on Twitter and Facebook (inaudible), oh you didn't say you're here for Trump, this about -- this isn't about Trump. This is going to hurt Ted -- this process, the rules is going to hurt Ted Cruz as much as it's going to hurt Donald Trump, because they will take -- they can feasibly take it away from Trump or Cruz.PERINO: I think there are some ways. I think that people that worried about, though, are worrying about the wrong thing. I mean, what -- the goal should be to try t o get to 1237. I think the agitation is coming from everybody realizing no one is getting to 1237, 1237 is the number, that's the majority. But on the representational issue, the -- you don't -- the Electoral College is what it is. It is -- look at 2000, that the popular vote did not prevail. I mean we have a representational government for a reason.RIVERA: I was gonna talk about 200 and I will.PERINO: If you want to change -- I mean there is a movement that wants to change and not have an Electoral College and just go to a straight popular vote. But that's just not the system that we have right now, and it is actually one I think would be bad. I think the founding fathers had it right when they set it up the way that they did.RIVERA: It just seems to me, you -- we will be talking more, I am sure about how aggressive the Trump supporters have been, how aggressive the Sanders supporters have been, bullying, cajoling, late night phone calls and so forth. But you remember, and I'm sure you do Dana, in 2000, November 2000. The Brooks Brothers brigade, Congressman John Sweeney here in New York. George W. Bush called him congressman kickass. He went down with 100 GOP thugs all dressed up. They literally --PERINO: I don't know what you're talking about.RIVERA: They physically stopped the recount of the vote in South Florida. It's not -- this is not new hard elbow politics. It's not new now --PERINO: Brooks Brothers suits --RIVERA: Yeah, Brooks Brothers brigade, that's what they called it. Look it up.PERINO: Well, no, I mean, I know that they were able to -- that was the fight in the recount. But I -- that wasn't a suggestion that there should not be an Electoral College. Even the democrats were arguing that at the time.RIVERA: Well, Electoral College, I mean, it's all states rights and all of that.PERINO: But that's representational government, the same with the delegates.GUTFELD: I would -- I mean, I don't mind that --RIVERA: I remember (inaudible) the popular vote.GUTFELD: Geraldo, I don't vote on any bills. I don't vote on any bills. Congressman do -- if we -- they represent us. The other thing too is Trump is doing better at delegate-wise -- percentage-wise then he is on vote. It's helping him.BOLLING: So is Cruz.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: And so is Cruz. They both now because --GUTFELD: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: But Trump is about 20 percent --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: But what happens if Trump doesn't have 1237? Let say --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: There's a rule.RIVERA: What happens then?GUTFELD: There's a rule for that.RIVERA: OK, what are the rules?GUTFELD: Then you go to the first ballot, the second ballot, the third ballot.RIVERA: And then what happens in the second ballot when the 1200 becomes 1152, and then on the third ballot, 1145. And then it becomes --PERINO: Well, they keep going. It's going to be awesome.RIVERA: And becomes -- and then .BOLLING: I have an answer for this.RIVERA: . the sand pile is washing away.BOLLING: I do know the answer for this.RIVERA: And what does his people gonna do? What are they're going to do?GUTFELD: It's same on what happened with Abraham Lincoln.BOLLING: So --GUTFELD: Third ballot.BOLLING: No, but let's say you get the 40 ballots --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: Yeah, really.BOLLING: No, but here's what happens. I -- talked to a lot of people about this.RIVERA: In Cleveland in the summer.BOLLING: Here's what happens. At some point, even though the rules committee is going to be, I guess, populated by mostly Trump and Cruz delegates, because they have the most. Allegedly, it's going to be more than half. If they make the rule that only someone with a TRC can be nominated.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: . as president, then you would think it would stop right there. But at some point, during the process, there's one. There's a hundred and twelve 112 delegates on the rules committee, but there's one overseer, and that's gonna be -- probably be Reince Priebus or Paul Ryan, and they -- that man, right there, can call for a rule change after 40 votes.PERINO: After 40 votes they might --BOLLING: But whatever --PERINO: After 40 votes, everybody might ask them too.BOLLING: But think about this --GUILFOYLE: They might have to do something --BOLLING: Just think about this one second. Kimberly, when you --GUTFELD: Television, you'll love it.BOLLING: No hung jury. Get to a number, get -- get your number. Get your 1237, you guys.GUILFOYLE: But when you get a hung jury to decide.GUTFELD: That's would happen. It's that six of these --GUILFOYLE: ... and see if you get (inaudible).(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: They have what, look they have 10 and 6 -- and six have become republican president, if I'm not mistaken. Because it happens, people do get tired of it, and then they make a decision.BOLLING: But Greg, if it's down to you and me at the convention, right? Where we are the only one --RIVERA: I'm walking out.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: And Geraldo -- and Geraldo's case, OK. He has no -- he's not when you're near the numbers.GUTFELD: Thank God.BOLLING: You and I are gonna set the rules so that only you or I can win. Now we'll beat, we'll beat the heck out of each other --RIVERA: I got a better scenario.BOLLING: However, the 10 times that you're talking about, there was someone else that could come in.RIVERA: My scenario is I take my 1200 and I walk. I'm Trump. I see what's going on with you guys --GUTFELD: Already.RIVERA: All these (inaudible). I'm walking.GUILFOYLE: And what would you do, third party run?RIVERA: Third party.PERINO: In the meantime, Hillary Clinton runs away with the presidency.RIVERA: Correct.(LAUGHTER)RIVERA: Correct.PERINO: All right. It's a big night in the Big Apple. All five presidential candidates are here making their final speeches to voters at events tonight, and we are covering it all. Make sure to catch us special, believe this or not, a live edition of ""The Five"" is at 11:00 p.m. eastern, tonight.GUTFELD: That's ""The Five""?PERINO: Yeah.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Oh no.PERINO: And that thing is going to be fun.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: That's the Nightmare Five.PERINO: Do you know that I almost asked today for a graphic of ""The Five"" of us to show.GUILFOYLE: Really?PERINO: I probably should have done that.GUILFOYLE: Is that -- would Hillary be on the leg chair there?BOLLING: Oh my, gosh.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Yes. Hillary would be on leg chair in that case.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: All right, ahead. Bernie Sanders need to pull up a big upset against Hillary Clinton in New York on Tuesday. Can he do it? We'll ask election Ed Henry, that's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Bernie Sanders has his work cut out for him, indeed. He only has five more days to convince New York voters to pick him over their former senator. Is his anti-establishment message enough to get him across the finish line?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BERNIE SANDERS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When I look out at the thousands of people who are here tonight --(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I think we've got a surprise for the establishment.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I think that if we have a large voter turnout on Tuesday, we're going to win this thing. Thank you all very much.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right, Sanders got some unsolicited help today from conservative Super PAC American Crossroads. They put out this dramatic attack ad depicting his opponent as a modern day Richard Nixon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICHARD NIXON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: What I have stated from the beginning to be the truth has been the truth.HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want people to understand what the truth is.NIXON: I am confident the American people will come to realize I have not violated the trusts.CLINTON: I am confident by the end of this campaign people will know they can trust me.NIXON: The entire story is there.CLINTON: I turned over everything I was obligated to turn over.NIXON: I want the facts out.CLINTON: I want those e-mails out.NIXON: I'm sorry. I just hope I haven't let you down.CLINTON: I'm sorry about that. I take responsibility.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Now, for more on the dramatic race, let's bring in Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry who is live in Brooklyn. Hello, Ed.ED HENRY, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good to see you.GUILFOYLE: Nice joggers.HENRY: Well, it's interesting --(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: You've got some joggers behind.HENRY: I thought there was some question to there.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, yeah, we're looking at the joggers.HENRY: Oh yeah, well --(LAUGHTER)HENRY: I hope they're all good-looking, and they were -- we'll check them out.GUTFELD: Look us.HENRY: I think it is important that you mentioned the context of the general election in terms of that American Crossroads ad, that's a conservative group who will undoubtedly be pounding Hillary Clinton if she is the democratic nominee, talking about the e-mails. But that's a stark contrast to what we are likely to see tonight. Bernie Sanders said at the very beginning of the first debate, he was taking the e-mails off the table. Very few debate moderators have pressed Hillary Clinton over the course of the last several months on that issue.Although there was a little hint from the Sanders camp today that you had both of these candidates yesterday on the picket lines with striking Verizon workers in the New York City area and the Sanders camp was saying, wait a second. It turned out Hillary Clinton was with the workers yesterday. But back in 2013 she gave one of those big paid speeches, over $200,000 paid for by, yes, Verizon. So she was standing up to the company yesterday, on behalf of the workers, but it turns out a couple years ago, was making big money from the company. That may come up tonight guys.GUILFOYLE: That's what you call an inconvenient truth. All right, so Greg has something special for you.GUTFELD: Well, it is interesting that Hillary does have something in common with Richard Nixon. Nixon had a dog and she married one. Ed, you've been in Brooklyn now for a few hours, had you tried any artesian yogurt or gotten anything pierced?(LAUGHTER)HENRY: I have not gotten any pierce, at least not yet. I will tell you a funny story, and I know you like funny, Greg. You're very funny.GUTFELD: Oh, please.HENRY: As you just stay at the outside.GUTFELD: No.HENRY: Extremely funny.GUTFELD: Stop it.GUILFOYLE: Looking.HENRY: And the ""New York Post"" had a great story saying, there are so many Brooklyn hipsters who do not cable, they can't watch the debate tonight, so they are flooding local bars here in Brooklyn. The hipsters saying, ""Please show the debate."" And normally they've got the Mets game or the Yankees game. There's a fight over which team they gonna support. The Brooklyn hipsters tonight are saying, ""Give us the Bern or give us Hillary.""GUILFOYLE: Wow.RIVERA: Do you -- that's interesting, Ed. Do you think, they, you know, since they don't have cable and they are not plugged into the practical side of life, do you think they'll show up at the polling place next Tuesday? You know it's easy to go to rally, it's easy to, you know hang around with, you know, your pals. What about turnout? Any, any idea of what turnout does in this --HENRY: Well --RIVERA: Contest?HENRY: Geraldo, I think like you, the candidate is the major candidates transcend cable and they're big on the internet and big out on the streets as well. And you know --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: Bernie Sanders is great on ""Dancing with the Stars.""GUILFOYLE: Oh my, god, feel the Bern.HENRY: Well, look, I think you did a great job. I don't care what anybody says. I'll defend you all the way.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I don't care what anybody says.HENRY: I don't care what anyone says. I mean I am referring --(CROSSTALK)HENRY: Maybe there's a little criticism, but I thought you did a great job. Look --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: He's our star.HENRY: Look --GUILFOYLE: All right.HENRY: People talking --(CROSSTALK)HENRY: I was talking about Hillary Clinton in a live shot before, and a bunch of folks walked by here in Brooklyn and they're like, ""Bernie, Bernie."" So look, yeah, they might not have cable, but they know, they go to the rallies, they're excited about this campaign, and I think tonight's debate. This primary, next Tuesday, it's do or die for Bernie Sanders. Let's face it. He's at momentum, he's won at least seven straight contests, but delegate math, he's behind Hillary Clinton.BOLLING: Hey, Ed. One of the things that, when they're debating, whether their reaction, they don't even have this debate or not was, the one of the issues is you're standing there in Brooklyn, over that river right over there where it cross going little b it south. Wall Street, that's right across lower of Manhattan.HENRY: Yeah.BOLLING: How does Bernie Sanders play this? How you points over there and say, hey, you're the one who, you know, as you point out, did a speech for Verizon, a couple of years ago. You're the one who took $600,000 in speeches.HENRY: Yeah.BOLLING: . Goldman Sachs, right over there. How does she defend that? What's her comeback to that?HENRY: It's funny you asked that, because she just did an interview that emerged with some Philadelphia journalists. Because after New York it will be the following week will go on to Pennsylvania primary, as you know at the end of April. And some Philadelphia journalists pressed her about those Wall Street speeches and said where the transcripts? And Hillary Clinton got a little frustrated. And the audio is out there and she basically said, ""Why don't you ask Bernie Sanders about why he hasn't released his entire tax returns? Why are you just coming after me?"" And so, I think we put that together with the Greenpeace activists, a couple weeks ago, who got her on a rope line about contributions from the oil and gas industries. She's gotten frustrated with the attacks. She's gotten frustrated with the fact that Bernie Sanders is still around. She thought he would be gone by now.GUILFOYLE: Dana.PERINO: A couple of things. So this is a debate that she didn't think she's gonna have to do. And if she had -- I think won Wisconsin.HENRY: Right.PERINO: . she probably won't be doing it. But so she's doing this debate tonight, he has her a little bit on the run. But Bernie Sanders, who has been willing to kind of be aggressive when he is not around her, not in person, has been effective.HENRY: Right.PERINO: But when he gets next to her in a debate, he tends to pull his punches. Do you think that tonight he will aggressively pursue the lines of attack he's been pursuing the last couple of weeks, or does he take a pass on it?HENRY: You asked a good question. I think that he knows, as I just laid out, that if he doesn't bring his A-game tonight, time is running out. And so he's gonna have to step it up. But I hesitate, because we've heard this before, there's been pre-game hype at all these debates. But the gloves are coming off, you come off with every tired, metaphor there is. And then as you say, you're actually -- absolutely right Dana, that Bernie Sanders ends up sort of walking up to that line and pulling back. So I can't say with certainty that he's gonna do it. He's staff says he's ready, and then he's been oppressor, but we've heard that before. And I think part of his hesitation is that among the hardcore democrats, they want to take her on policy-wise, but they've know -- necessarily want to see her pushed on the honest and trustworthy question. Because at the end of this democrats are getting nervous about these two coming together. As you say, this has gone on longer, and it's gotten a little nasty in the last couple of weeks. So everyone talks about how the republicans are divided, and they are. But the democrats are divided too.GUILFOYLE: All right, Ed, enjoy that nice weather in Brooklyn. Thanks for being with us.HENRY: Good to see you.GUILFOYLE: Ahead, Sanders love to say corporations are destroying America. So why is one of the biggest getting attacked? Greg thinks he knows -- let see.GUTFELD: Hi, Charles.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Like most on the left, Bernie Sanders demonizes big business, from banks to GE and now Verizon. Verizon outsources and makes a profit, which in left-speak is theft. Having no idea that wealth is actually created and then shared, they assume it must be stolen from some mysterious finite pie that's existed in the universe since the Big Bang.But one company always escapes their wrath: Apple. When asked if Apple is wrecking America, Bernie said, no. See, he knows how shallow his fans are. The typical protester only goes after giant, unlovable companies like Verizon, because they're conveniently abstract. You can't put Verizon in your pocket or show it off, so to activists, they're just like your mean, big, invisible dad who never hugged you. The iPhone, however is part of who you are, a status symbol nestled in your pocket like a friendly little robot baby.And there's the hypocrisy, activists only protest stuff that doesn't enhance their identity. Apple outsources like crazy, but who cares when you're tweeting pictures of your gluten-free socks, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: I love them.GUTFELD: It's like protesting the police. College kids don't own anything or run a business so it is fun to heckle the men in blue. The result: The police back off and shootings go up in the communities that the college kids don't live in. But let's say they protest Apple and Apple complies: No more making phones in China. In a year the iPhone would cost more than a pre-owned Prius. There goes the trip to Burning Man, and you were going to Instagram the whole thing.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Do you know one thing I noticed, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: You know whatever protests fossil fuels in a harsh winter, like when you got to heat your dorm.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: They're not out there screaming about natural gas.GUILFOYLE: Well, because --GUTFELD: All of it, but they won't.GUILFOYLE: Well, it's convenient. You know liberalism, convenient, progressivism where they say, OK, here's what we're for. But you noticed, like we (inaudible) from Ed Henry, like Hillary Clinton, happy to take money, you know, for speeches (inaudible), but at the same time she'll show up and be like, I'm all about we, the people, the workers. Let's fight back and then give the whole anti-corporate thing. So you really see the hypocrisy, but somehow, if you're liberal, you get away with it.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: And there's just this sort of loose relationship with honesty and with integrity and with ethics.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Because anything goes to get it done.GUTFELD: Well, you know, Eric, there's another hypocrisy. With the left talking about outsourcing; it's about protecting workers. But if the right talks about outsourcing, it's bigotry.BOLLING: Not only that. Think about these -- these hipster who love their iPhone but are ticked off at Verizon and AT&T.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: You don't want them to outsource; you're against that. You want -- you want salaries raised. You want all that stuff. Guess how much your plan is going to cost when you open up and pay for your iPhone...GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: ... bill every single month? It's going to go up. Don't complain about that. Be -- as you point out, be consistent. If you're mad at Verizon and AT&T, be mad at iPhone -- at Apple, as well.GUTFELD: Yes.Geraldo, aren't they just -- isn't this just easy targeting?RIVERA: I think what's going on, though, it's easy to scoff at stuff.GUTFELD: Yes.RIVERA: But when you see the energy like the Washington Square demonstration for Sanders yesterday, you could not help but be impressed. He squeezed 27,000 into Washington Square Park. It is in the midst of NYU, granted. A very hip kind of community. But that energy, that vibe, that's real. And I think that's why Hillary Clinton is looking over her shoulder now in a way she never expected. So thought she'd be looking toward the Republican nominee, but instead, she has all of these psyched kids. They're the Occupy forces, the Black Lives Matter. They're all of these different groups questing for years for a cause. Now they have a cause in the 74-year-old guy from Vermont.GUTFELD: But the cause, Dana, is always the same. It's -- it's rich people. It's wealth. It's corporations. And then they -- then they get older. They get married; they have kids. And they realize profit is not a bad thing, because that's how you put food on the table.PERINO: True. And I admire the CEO of Verizon, Lowell McAdam, who pushed back. In the face of all of this overwhelming positive coverage...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ... from people like Bernie Sanders and socialism, he was able to push back, I thought, very effectively.But the reason that they don't -- they would go after Verizon and not Apple also has to do with progressive politics at the corporate level. And David French at National Review wrote a really great piece yesterday, talking about how progressive politics is now infused at the CEO level in some companies, and Apple certainly is one of them with Tim Cook being -- recently, you know, fighting back against the FBI...GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: ... in regards to the terrorism investigation that they were doing after San Bernardino.The other thing is what Verizon is talking about is progress. You cannot stop progress. Technology is coming. The bigger public policy issue that Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Trump, whoever it is, is going to have to deal with is the fact that this is coming, no matter what.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Because you know what? Guess who likes to use automated stuff? Young people.GUTFELD: Exactly.PERINO: They don't want to have to talk to anybody. They like it at the McDonald's that they can go in and order by iPad. They would rather call up Verizon and do it by a phone tree.GUTFELD: That is so true. It's the wave of the future.PERINO: Those jobs are going anyway.GUTFELD: Yes. Which I predicted 40 years ago.PERINO: Sorry to be the skunk at the garden party.GUTFELD: All right.All right. Coming up.RIVERA: We're going to have a robot replace you.GUTFELD: Yes, there you go.PERINO: Fine.GUTFELD: Russian war planes in the Baltic Sea. Putin's fighter jets carry out aggressive maneuvers dangerously close to a U.S. Navy ship. The White House reaction ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RIVERA: If you could hear the commercials. We just had an intriguing conversation about what constitutes creepy. Very interesting.That's creepy. That's creepy. The Russian war planes flying extremely close to one of our U.S. destroyers, not once, not twice. Multiple times in the Baltic Sea this week. So close for the Russian aircraft they created wakes in the water near our warship.The Kremlin, with tongue firmly in cheek, denying any aggressive behavior - - sure -- saying their pilots were checking out our ship and were complying with safety regulations. The White House, though, as you might expect, says otherwise.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The incident is inconsistent with the professional norms of militaries that are operating in proximity to each other in international waters and airspace.In fact, there is a bilateral agreement between the United States and Russia that dates back to the Cold War that governs incidents exactly like this. This specific incident is pretty specifically contemplated by this agreement. The United States has raised our concerns with the Russians.(END VIDEO CLIP)RIVERA: You can raise your concerns, Greg, but it's like ""Top Gun,"" you know? They're just showing off. The plane was not armed. I don't think it's that big a deal.GUTFELD: I'm glad we sent a formal complaint. I heard that in it, they said, ""If you don't respond, you will not be invited -- Putin will not be invited to Obama's birthday party. There's going to be face painting. There's going to be a juggler and a real live cowboy.""But they said if Putin doesn't do it -- and Putin knows the state of our affairs. He knows that we're in disarray. He's kind of like -- he knows there's a fight going on in the house, so he keep throwing his Frisbee in your yard, because he knows -- he knows he can do it. One of these days, we just have to take his Frisbee.RIVERA: But you know, far more substantive than this to me, Eric, is the fact that Putin is snubbing us on the nuclear proliferation conference, not showing up. That's a big -- a big gap in our ambition to stop the proliferation.BOLLING: So what he did in Syria, he took the ball away from President Obama. He said, ""I've got this year"" and kind of left there feeling pretty good about himself. I think the Russian people liked what he did in Syria.And then he doesn't show up to the nuclear proliferation summit that was in D.C. And now this. This happened over two days. There were -- 11 times they buzzed the ship over a two-day period. I think after the first time, you send a message saying, ""You do it again, I don't care if you're armed or not, we're going to knock one of those down.""I think you give them a fair warning. You get NATO involved and have NATO say, ""We are going to do this, and we have the support of NATO to do it."" You can't have Russian MIGs or whatever...RIVERA: SU-24s.BOLLING: Whatever. You can't have them buzzing our ship. You can't.RIVERA: That was an Aegis class destroyer. They could knock that airplane out, Dana, you know, with their eyes closed. But isn't it easy to overreact to something like that?PERINO: Yes, and I think that is true. Our military, they're so professional, and they exercise a tremendous amount of restrain. And I liked Captain Rick Hoffman, who said, ""You don't get -- you don't get to kill people because they are annoying.""RIVERA: Exactly.PERINO: That was his theory. I was surprised. I was surprised to hear that.BOLLING: Like the one on ""The Five.""GUILFOYLE: Nine lives.PERINO: I have One More Thing. It's not just that, you know, Russia was dismissive saying, ""Oh, look, no harm done."" It's what not they say to us that matters. It's what they say to their domestic audience, which is a very different story. Because they are -- he is trying to -- Putin is trying to shore up his credentials amongst his people so that they think he's a big dog in the world.RIVERA: With the price of oil plunging...PERINO: Right.RIVERA: ... poverty rates going way up in Russia.GUILFOYLE: But he's still -- yes, he's still his own best advertising.RIVERA: Here's my -- here's my question.GUILFOYLE: Yes.RIVERA: What if the plane was an Iranian plane? Would we be so cool, calm and collected about it?GUILFOYLE: No. I would hope that we would not be. But I mean, I also think that we need to do something to let them know that it's not OK to routinely do this. What about the one time when it -- when it is armed? I mean, I just think that we're entering into a little bit of dangerous territory here. And if it becomes too complacent, I bet we're not even issuing warnings at this point. They're buzzing.And you have China doing the same thing. They're developing, you know, anti-carrier missiles that are so powerful, they call them carrier killers. Like, they can knock out one of our destroyers and our ships. So we have to be a little, like, up on this. It's not so much about worrying about hurting people's feelings. Because there is strength in appropriate diplomacy.BOLLING: You need a tough commander-in-chief to really put his foot down on this stuff.RIVERA: Well...PERINO: Bernie Sanders is going to be great.GUTFELD (IMITATING BERNIE SANDERS): ""I don't like your planes flying over.""BOLLING (IMITATING BERNIE SANDERS): ""Sending planes over.""RIVERA: Let's have some chicken soup. Don't move. Kobe, Kimmel and Cruz coming up next in ""The Fastest Seven."" Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back.

When you think who played for the Lakers, you had Magic; you had Kareem; you had Wilt, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor. I'll even throw in a sixth with James Worthy. I'll even throw a seventh one, Fletch. Do you remember when Fletch played for the Lakers?RIVERA: Better than Kobe?GUTFELD: Yes. Better than Kobe. James Worthy.RIVERA: Kobe should get do what Jordan did and get a franchise.

This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" October 11, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, Donald Trump is doing what the liberal mainstream media refuses to do, and that is expose Hillary Clinton's real record to you, the American people. Instead of waiting for the so-called journalists to ever do their job in this election campaign, well, Trump vetted Hillary Clinton and her disastrous record at the second presidential debate. This is very important. Think in your mind, why didn't they ask her these questions?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.And Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have. And he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.So you really owe him an apology. You're the one that sent the pictures around. Your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else. And she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.  That's one that I have a...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: OK, honest Abe. Honest Abe never lied. That's the good thing.  That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.For you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e- mails -- again, you should be ashamed of yourself. And by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal making, the Iran deal, with $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough cash to fill up this room.The way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, so how did we get to this point where Donald Trump is actually doing the job of the mainstream media? Remember back in 2008, I said journalism is dead. Well, it still is.Now, the media refuses to delve into Hillary Clinton's past, just like they refuse to ask back in 2008 about then senator Barack Obama and his radical ties. Remember, the media wouldn't touch stories or ask questions about Obama's relationship with unrepentant domestic terrorist Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn, or about Obama's ties to his pastor of more than 20 years, the church of GD America, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright?Now, the liberal press -- they turned a blind eye to Obama's embracing of the tactics of the radical left -- you know, left-wing activists like Saul Alinsky. And those are just a few examples.Also tonight, while the media colludes with the Clinton campaign to try and tear down Donald Trump, well, the GOP nominee continues to campaign even harder. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We're going to take on the special interests, the corrupt media -- and it is corrupt -- and the career politicians that have stolen your jobs, your wealth, and stolen our middle class. They've stolen our middle class!And Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue about how to bring back jobs. That I can tell you, folks. She doesn't have a clue. If she wanted to, she couldn't do it. You know, in New York state, she ran for the Senate, and you know upstate New York is a disaster for jobs. And she said, I'm going to bring back 200,000 jobs. Guess what? Right down the tubes, worse today than ever before.I'm not proud of everything that I've done in life. I mean, who among us is. Is anybody totally proud of every single element? Some, we are. But let me tell you what I'm very proud of. I'm proud that I've always treated the blue collar worker, and I consider myself in a certain way to be a blue collar worker, that makes this country run with tremendous respect. The waiters and waitresses, the cops and firefighters, the receptionists and the custodians -- we treat them with dignity and respect. These are great people. These are great people.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And here now with reaction, author of the brand-new book -- it is out today -- it's called ""Treason"" -- former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor Newt Gingrich. Good to see you. How are you?NEWT GINGRICH, FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be with you.HANNITY: And you're going to be in New Jersey, Ridgewood, tomorrow at 7:00 o'clock.GINGRICH: I am.HANNITY: Bookends (ph). Great place to be.GINGRICH: (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: All right, there's so much ground to cover here. But we have learned not only did the media not ask the questions that Donald Trump brought up in this debate, but what do we find out? We learn that Univision's head was encouraging Clinton to hit Trump harder. NBC, John Harwood -- he actually moderated a debate. He was advising the Clinton campaign.We know The New York Times -- we've been interviewed by The New York Times a lot. They ever give you veto power over your quotes? That she had veto power.GINGRICH: (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: Boston Globe coordinating how to increase her presence at their newspaper. Then we have instances -- Donna Brazile was at CNN literally sharing town hall questions, although she denies it, in fairness to her.  How they actually used Benghazi to distract four dead Americans from her e- mail server scandal.There's so much here, and so little time. What do you make of this, but more specifically, how corrupt our news media is?GINGRICH: Well, let's stay with the news media for a second. Good friend of mine, Barry Castleman (ph), who writes a blog out in Minnesota, wrote yesterday that what we're seeing is a news media coup d'etat. He said he's always seen bias, but he's never seen the unified media try to destroy a candidate.And what you've seen starting on Friday was a deliberate effort to destroy Trump, and at the same time to smother all of the secret -- you know, I describe it as the secret Hillary. And I think it's very important for people to understand. The next 27 days are a straight-up fight between Trump's social media and the news media's effort to destroy him.HANNITY: That's what it is. We have now media outlets, top outlets, that are coordinating with the Clintons to take down Trump and not do their job!GINGRICH: But look, it's time to get past baloney. I mean, you had -- you had a major figure at ABC who gave thousands of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. You have the head of CBS News's brother is the number two person in the National Security Council for Obama. I mean, the -- I tell people it's not that they're for Hillary, they are Hillary.HANNITY: That's a powerful statement. They're an extension of the Hillary campaign.GINGRICH: Or she's an extension of them.HANNITY: And how did I -- how do I get all this criticism when I tell everybody I'm a conservative?GINGRICH: Because you're conservative.(LAUGHTER)GINGRICH: You understand. This business...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: The thing the American people need to understand is that after eight years of damage by Obama, Hillary Clinton, if she wins, will mean the end of America as we've known it, literally. Her radical judges will eliminate the 2nd Amendment. They'll eliminate religious liberty. They'll eliminate freedom of speech. Her radical appointees will shift power to Washington. She'll bring the most corrupt administration in history into the White House, and the rule of law will become irrelevant. It'll be -- as we're discovering from these WikiLeaks, it'll be the rule of friends of Bill.GINGRICH: Here's what we learned in the -- we learned that Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC coordinated to basically hurt Bernie Sanders any way they could. We learned in the last WikiLeaks dump that Hillary Clinton wants an open hemisphere, where six million people could come into the country, and she admits that she's one person in private and another person in public.Now we also find in the hacked emails she's praising Vladimir Putin! She was criticizing Trump on Sunday for the same thing. And she admits vetting Syrian refugees is impossible! These are key issues in the campaign!GINGRICH: Sure. And she also (INAUDIBLE) by the way, to say she doesn't worry about terrorism in the United States. Now, of course, the whole point of my novel ""Treason"" is to remind people this stuff is really, really dangerous.But I want to go to one thing you said because this is one of the challenges. There's so much stuff coming out that you get lost. Her proposal, what she described (INAUDIBLE) is really important. Her dream it's her word, ""dream."" What she said to Brazilian bankers in a secret speech for which they paid $225,000, having eight months earlier paid her husband $400,000 -- she says, My dream is of an open border hemisphere.Now, that means MS-13 gangs from El Salvador, the most dangerous country in the world. It means the FARC coming in from Colombia, the largest cocaine producers in the world. It means the Mexican cartels come in.And you read this and you think to yourself, Is this woman crazy? Does she have any idea what her words mean in the real world? And if Trump could simply slow down, focus on three or four things like that and say, Look...HANNITY: He can't possibly talk about all of them, can he.GINGRICH: Right. So he's got to -- he's got to pick the ones -- but if we had a referendum in the next -- the election (INAUDIBLE) started, so you can't wait until election day.HANNITY: People are now voting.GINGRICH: Right. So if he could have the referendum on if you really want 600 million people, including MS-14 and the FARC and the Mexican cartels, free access to America, vote for Hillary. If you really think we should control our southern border control, vote for me. My guess is that's 75/25.HANNITY: Do you realize the revelations about how they coordinated with the media, their contacts within the White House, their contacts at the Department of Justice while she is being investigated...GINGRICH: Right.HANNITY: ... how the White House is coordinating talking points on the e- mail server...GINGRICH: Right.HANNITY: This is all revealed. I don't believe it's even possible for the American people to absorb the depth of corruption that now exists within our government and what a phony she is and how hypocritical on so many levels she is!GINGRICH: She's more than a phony. She is the most dishonest...HANNITY: Corrupt.GINGRICH: ... most corrupt person ever to get this far in the presidential campaign. And think about what you just said a minute ago. I believe Trump's most important statement in the debate was that he would appoint an independent counsel. And my argument is not just for Hillary. We need an independent counsel at the Veterans Administration. We need an independent counsel to interrogate the current attorney general and Bill Clinton to find out what did they say for an hour...HANNITY: On that airplane.GINGRICH: ... in the airplane just before they interviewed Hillary?HANNITY: I'll be fair, it was about 39 minutes.GINGRICH: OK, (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: Awful lot of time...GINGRICH: They need to both be under oath.HANNITY: Under oath. Well, the Clintons have never -- Hillary's never put under oath.We got to take a break. By the way, congrats on the -- where did I put it.  Oh, I got my copyright right here. See? It's called ""Treason,"" Newt Gingrich, pretty smart guy.All right, we'll take a break. We'll come back. More with Newt Gingrich after this.Also, up next, WikiLeaks did release thousands of these emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager. The revelations are beyond stunning.  We'll tell you what they are when we come back.And later -- with exactly four weeks until election day, Indiana governor Mike Pence is here.Also a quick programming note. The third and final presidential debate will take place next Wednesday in Vegas. Now, for the first time ever, a FOX News anchor will be moderating a general election presidential debate.  Chris Wallace, our colleague, will moderate that all-important final showdown between Trump and Clinton. And again, that's next Wednesday, October the 19th. The best place to watch right here on the FOX News Channel.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" As we've been discussing, WikiLeaks released another 1,000 emails purportedly from the Gmail account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Now, over the past few days, they've released over 5,000, and the revelations from today's WikiLeaks e- mail dump -- it should make you, the American people, angry and furious.Now, let's go through what they reveal. In one email, well, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon is caught clearly colluding with the U.S. Justice Department during their investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server. Fallon wrote in an email to several Clinton staffers, including Podesta, quote, ""DOJ folks informed me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge's thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as possible.""  Wow! Pretty unbelievable.Now, the White House, of course, is denying any wrongdoing. But that's not all. Now, as it turns out, the Clinton campaign wasn't just colluding with the Justice Department, they were also coordinating openly with members of the mainstream media.For example, according to one of the leaked emails, CNBC's John Harwood -- well, he gave advice to the Clinton campaign, and he said, I imagine that Obama feels some sad vindication at this demonstration of his year-long point about the opposition party veering off the rails.In another leaked email chain, top Clinton officials are clearly being pressured by the chairman of Univision to hit Donald Trump harder over immigration. And that's not all. The leaked emails also allegedly show the Clinton campaign also had a very cozy relationship with The New York Times, and particularly with its reporter Mark Leibovich (ph), who allowed the campaign to edit out certain Clinton quotes from a 2015 interview.  Isn't that nice? Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri even told them, quote, ""Pleasure doing business with you.""Of course, this is only the tip of the iceberg, with other leaked emails showing a staffer calling Chelsea Clinton, quote, ""a spoiled brat,"" John Podesta's obsession with aliens. And sometimes Clinton was told when to smile during her speeches. That would be like me reading this to you and say, Hi. How are you? I'll smile now. It was written into the script and much, much more.We continue with former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor, author of the brand-new book ""Treason."" Newt Gingrich is with us.It's spectacularly corrupt. And here's my worry. So they didn't vet Hillary. You know, I had an interview today, Kathy Shelton. Kathy Shelton was raped when she was 12 years old. The attorney for the guy accused of rape was Hillary Clinton.The story she tells about how Hillary Clinton blamed the accuser -- sometimes young girls like this have fantasies about being with older men.  The evidence in the lab proved the blood was the young girl's, was Kathy Shelton's. The semen was the man accused. They gave the evidence for independent investigation and it comes back all the evidence was gone.And then Hillary Clinton brags about on tape, Oh, I even gave him a lie detector test. He passed, of course, which forever, you know, got rid of any belief I had in lie detector tests, bragging she got off somebody she knew was guilty.Now, they talk about Donald Trump's words, locker room talk, as if it's the worst thing in the world. She got a rapist off, a person she knew was guilty of rape, laughs and brags about it, and we have the tape! And the most people in America have never seen that.GINGRICH: Now, look, I mean, this is again one of the challenges of having -- what you have is a establishment news media which will do almost nothing to hurt Hillary Clinton while doing everything to hurt Donald Trump.In this case, by the way, two years after that trial, a law was passed that's called a rape shield.HANNITY: Rape shield, yes, which would have forbidden what she did.GINGRICH: And these are the kind of reasons it was done. There's a 12- year-old girl who's already been humiliated and put through the terrible damage of being raped, and now she is further humiliated by the female attorney...HANNITY: Hillary.GINGRICH: ... whose job is to destroy her at 12 years of age!HANNITY: And she did, and it ruined this woman's life.You know one of the most I think egregious things I saw in WikiLeaks -- nobody's has reported it -- there's actually an email that -- between Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri. It says, I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once for the first time she says, I'm running for president, because you and everyday Americans need a champion, Podesta replied. And then Palmieri said, Truth.They're saying she has contempt! And then there was another point where they said, you know, the email outlines an effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry! They have contempt for the American people! And they admit it!GINGRICH: It's going to be very hard in the next two or three days to go through all this material. See, I think part of what it begins to reveal is how genuinely radical the Clinton team is. There's an email where they're mocking Rupert Murdoch for having become Catholic and where they're describing the Catholic church as this weird, reactionary, old-fashioned -- I mean (INAUDIBLE) realize these people are genuine radicals who have total contempt for Christianity and total contempt for organized religion.HANNITY: It is beyond anything that I know. I look at the polls, and right now, Hillary's ahead.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... today, according to the polls, she would win!GINGRICH: Yes, but look, this is the reverse of the Trump effect in the primaries. I mean, one of, you know, Trump's great strength overcoming all of George -- of Jeb Bush's ads, and all of Cruz's efforts, was he could dominate earned media. Well, you had Friday, Saturday and Sunday morning hundreds of replays of this one tape.And the poll that came out this morning...HANNITY: Media Research said more coverage of that tape in 48 hours than 17 years of the Juanita Broaddrick story!GINGRICH: Right. So think about it this way.HANNITY: I love it when you start laughing. Go ahead.GINGRICH: No, because there's both a tragedy for America as a country, and an enormous irony at how stupid they think we are, and frankly, some of my fellow Republicans turn out to be that stupid. OK, you get 48 hours of nonstop constant repetition.Then you get a poll that's taken before the debate. Then the poll comes out this morning after the debate. So if you're a normal Republican, you wake up, you go, Oh, my God, look how much trouble Trump is in. Well, by Sunday morning, he had been battered with so many -- you know, and...HANNITY: So here's my last question.GINGRICH: OK.HANNITY: And then you're going to come back later in the show your wife, Callista. OK. Is he going to win this election in the next 28 days? And more importantly what are we to think of a Republican Party that was so compliant to Obama's agenda, so quick to hate Trump, and never even looked at what the impact of a Hillary presidency would be on this country?And I'm starting with Paul Ryan because he's the worst. I don't think he's going to be speaker.GINGRICH: He's not the worst. He's not the worst.HANNITY: He will not last as speaker. My prediction.GINGRICH: We'll see. We'll see. Look, those are two very different questions...HANNITY: He's no Newt Gingrich.GINGRICH: He probably thinks that's a compliment.(LAUGHTER)GINGRICH: Look...HANNITY: That's a problem. That's a problem if he thinks that.GINGRICH: If Trump will focus all of his social media effort on driving home who Hillary Clinton really is, taking things like the open borders, 600 million people -- if he drives those things home, he's going to win the election, despite -- but it will be Trump and social media defeating...HANNITY: The mainstream media.GINGRICH: ... the mainstream war. (INAUDIBLE) head-up (ph) war. Second, I think that -- the only question that should be asked of every Republican is not, Are you going to support Donald Trump. Are you going to help beat Hillary Clinton, because Hillary Clinton will be the most corrupt, most dishonest person ever elected. Any Republican who's willing to help her should join the Democratic Party.HANNITY: Agreed. Well said.All right, we'll have more with Newt Gingrich in just a few minutes.Coming up -- with exactly four weeks to go in this race for the White House, well, Donald Trump's running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, will join us.And then later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Without the media, Hillary Clinton couldn't be elected dogcatcher.  I mean that. It's true.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump calls out the liberal mainstream media for not vetting Hillary Clinton's past. We're going to have reaction to the blatant liberal bias that we now know about as ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" We're in the final stretch, only 28 days, voters will head to the polls. Earlier, I spoke with Donald Trump's running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Governor, good to see you. How are you, sir?GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-IND., VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm great, Sean. Great to be back in Iowa. Had a great rally here today. And it's good to be with you.HANNITY: You know, Governor, I was really glad to see -- I wrote a whole piece on my Web site, Hannity.com, actions speak louder than words. And I know that a lot of people didn't like what Donald Trump said and the tape that was released. I'm getting some information that maybe Republicans had a hand in that, but that's a story for a different day.My question to you is, what do you make of so many weak Republicans that have done everything they can do, and are doing, to hurt this campaign, hurt Donald Trump, not see the dramatic, profound differences in policy and not prosecute the case against Hillary the way Donald Trump did in the debate Sunday night? What do you say to the Paul Ryans of the world?PENCE: Well, Paul Ryan is a personal friend of mine for many years, but I just respectfully disagree with him. Donald Trump and I couldn't be more grateful for the support that we're receiving from people all across this country, including Republican leaders.You know, I'm here in Iowa with Senator Joni Ernst, Congressman Steve King, Governor Terry Branstad, who are standing strong with Donald Trump. I got a call earlier today from Senator Roy Blunt asking us to come into Missouri for him.So I know the media likes to focus on a handful of Republicans who have chosen a different course, but we're really been overwhelmed...HANNITY: Yes.PENCE: ... to see leaders and rank and file Republicans, and many independents, and frankly, at my rallies here in Iowa today, many Democrats, who are responding to Donald Trump's message that we can make America great again.We can rebuild our military, revive our economy the way Ronald Reagan did in the '80s, and we can have appointments to the Supreme Court of the United States that will uphold our Constitution.So we're proud of the support we have here in Iowa, all over the country, and we're going to continue to work over the next four weeks...HANNITY: Governor...PENCE: ... to gain the confidence of even more Americans.HANNITY: I want to talk about some of these hacked emails. Let's look at some of the substance in them. It came up in your debate. It came up in the debate Sunday night about Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.But we've got hacked emails showing Hillary praising Putin. We've got hacked emails of her saying vetting Syrian refugees is impossible, and also how the Saudis and Qatar are funding ISIS, the same Saudis that persecute women and Christians and Jews and kill gays and lesbians that she took money from. And in fact, they're funding ISIS, and she knew it!What are we go -- and she also admits you can be one person in private, another person in public. I mean...PENCE: Well, I think that's the whole story, Sean, is what you have with these WikiLeaks releases of these emails is they're pulling back the curtain on the fact that Hillary Clinton is different in private than she is in public.In fact, she boasted about that, as you saw in that one excerpt from a speech, where she told some donor group that you have to have a different - - you know, different policies in public than you do in private. When she was challenged on that during her debate on Sunday night, she went into this long talk about Abraham Lincoln. But I've got to tell you, I said in Iowa today, as a member of party of Lincoln, I would prefer a dishonest Hillary to not associate herself anymore with honest Abe.But all this, the most remarkable one to me is the fact that we learned through the release today that she may well have released classified information about the takedown of Usama bin Laden. Now, contrast that with the fact that the man who shot Usama bin Laden was essentially held to account for having classified information in his book about it, and he was required to turn over nearly $7 million in royalties back to the government.This is about the kind of double standard that we're continuously seeing.  And I've got to tell you, people here in Iowa and all over the country have had enough of it. What they find in Donald Trump is someone who is the same person, the same person every day. He speaks honestly and forthrightly to the American people. And I think that's why you see the tremendous momentum in this campaign.HANNITY: It is a young man by the name of Christian Saucier who's 22 years old, he took pictures of classified areas in a submarine. He has a one-year-old daughter in Hawaii. Just for taking six pictures, he's going to jail for a year, compared to what Hillary said.PENCE: Right.HANNITY: Also in these emails, we see Univision, NBC, CNN, The New York Times, The Boston Globe, all helping Hillary's campaign, and we've got collusion between the Department of Justice, and the Clinton campaign, the White House, and the Clinton campaign. I don't know if people can absorb this in 28 days. And people are even voting now. What's your reaction to all this?PENCE: I think people are absorbing it. I'll tell you what, at our rally here in Iowa today, I talked about those very same things. The fact that it came out today and your viewers really just need to go and look at it, that the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign said that the folks at DOJ had given them a heads-up about information in the Justice Department's investigation of her private server. And at the same time many in the media are challenging Donald Trump and my call for a special prosecutor in this case.But again, this is the double standard. And the sailor that's going to jail for a year, that because he mishandled classified information, he took photographs on a nuclear submarine, and yet Hillary Clinton mishandles classified information and is not held to account for that. It's that double standard the American people are weary of. I think they see through it. And I think that's why even against all odds, against the media that literally does half of Hillary Clinton's work for her every day, this campaign is gaining momentum all across America. And I've got to tell you what, I think we're going to continue to drive forward and see this movement to make America great again grow all the way through a success on Election Day.HANNITY: All right, Governor, always good to see you. Thank you for taking the time to be with us.PENCE: Thank you.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And up next tonight right here on ""Hannity"" --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Without the media, Hillary Clinton couldn't be elected dogcatcher. I mean that. It's true.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump calling out the corrupt leftist liberal media for colluding with the Clinton campaign. Unbelievable. We'll expose that next.Also, newly leaked emails from WikiLeaks show Hillary Clinton allegedly knows and said that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were funding ISIS. Those are the same countries that donated millions and millions of dollars to the family foundation, and of course the Clinton Library. Should she give the money back? Dr. Sebastian Gorka weighs in coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So Donald Trump is slamming the mainstream media for their blatant leftwing bias. Yesterday at two different campaign stops in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump, he made some of his most scathing remarks to date. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I'll tell you what. The only thing she's got going is the media.  Without the media she wouldn't have a chance.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: The hypocrites in the media don't want to talk about what Hillary Clinton has done to these victims. They don't want to talk about what their other political heroes have done to other innocent girls and women.And this could get media, and you talk about crooked Hillary, they're worse than she is.Without the media, Hillary Clinton couldn't be elected dogcatcher. I mean that. It's true.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Joining us now, the chairman of the American Conservative Union Matt Schlapp, and media reporter for The Hill, Joe Concha. I don't even know where to begin here. Univision, NBC, CNN, ""New York Times,"" ""Boston Globe,"" where do we begin here? And who gets criticizing the whole campaign? Me.JOE CONCHA, ""THE HILL"": Only less than 100 times a day.(LAUGHTER)CONCHA: But here we have a paper trail. And as far as smoking guns, Sean, to have an email with a subject header from Donna Brazille who was with CNN at the time as a political analyst saying ""Sometimes I get the questions in advance."" And she sends that to the Clinton campaign communications director about a town hall coming up.HANNITY: The next day.CONCHA: She sends it March 12th. March 13th, a question about the death penalty that was what was concerning Brazile, comes up. The death penalty isn't exactly a common topic.HANNITY: Right.CONCHA: So here's what I want to know. We can complain about this all we want.HANNITY: She denies it, for the record.CONCHA: But you can't spin your way out of this.HANNITY: I know. I agree with you.CONCHA: There is no denying.HANNITY: I like Donna. Donna's straightforward. She's a liberal democratic. I have no problem with her. But leaking questions?CONCHA: A couple of months ago in June I met her in the green room in CNN.  Great lady. This isn't personal.But here's what I want to know. Will CNN do an internal investigation, because she wasn't part of that town hall. I want to know how those questions got from whoever was producing that town hall to her, and then into the Clinton campaign.I asked CNN, I asked them for an internal investigation. I'm getting crickets back. I got nothing left. John Harwood, CNBC colluding with the Clinton campaign, I want to know who Brian Roberts who runs CNBC -- I'm sorry, Comcast is going to do, or Mark Hoffman (ph), or -- because he writes for the ""New York Times."" Here's the problem. There's never any accountability. All right, we call them out on shows like this, or other media reporters do, but there's never any suspensions, firings, accountability. That has to happen here.HANNITY: And you follow me getting beat up. I am a conservative. I'm honest about it. And I get beat up for being honest. Seriously, I get pounded every four years. This election season has been no different.  Matt?MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Yes, that's exactly right. I was on another network in the last 24 hours, and they did two packages before I was on on the debate in St. Louis and never even mentioned the four women who Donald Trump brought with him to the debate.  They will not cover that story because it exposes their bias and exposes their malpractice over the last 20 years. What's at the heart and center of all this is they have chosen sides, and they have chosen Hillary's side.HANNITY: Think of it, this is Univision, NBC, CNN, ""The New York Times,"" ""The Boston Globe,"" and how many others we'll find out, right?CONCHA: Was Jorge Ramos under pressure from Univision's CEO to be tougher on Donald Trump?HANNITY: Apparently.CONCHA: If so, will they be transparent about it? Here's the thing --HANNITY: He claims to be a journalist.CONCHA: He's an anchor, right? You are a host. You're hosting a talk show.HANNITY: I am a talk host.CONCHA: Right. Right. And you've made no bones about the fact that you support Donald Trump. You're not pretending to be otherwise. If they care about integrity, they will do something here in terms of accountability.  If they don't do anything they are therefore agreeing that collusion is a good thing.HANNITY: Joe, I said in 2008, journalism is dead. This proves it. Last word, Matt?SCHLAPP: And the debate commission, the onus is on them. They've got to solve these problems. They've got to tighten these holes. There's been problem after problem. I call on them to do something to make sure that there's integrity to this debate process.HANNITY: It is probably the biggest revelation, but something I have known and talked about for years. Joe, good to see you. You are a fair journalist.CONCHA: Thank you.HANNITY: And Matt, you're a good conservative, so appreciate it. Honesty, finally.Coming up, a new batch of emails released by WikiLeaks. Hillary Clinton allegedly claims Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS. So why did her family foundation, why did the Clinton Library take all that money from those countries? Dr. Sebastian Gorka is next with reaction as we continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to HANNITY. So more headaches for the Clinton campaign because of the WikiLeaks email dump. According to the hacked e- mails back in 2014, Hillary Clinton sent an email to John Podesta claiming that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were both giving support to ISIS and other extremist groups.I remind you, Saudi Arabia has given up to $25 million to the Clinton Foundation. In addition to that, according to the ""Washington Post,"" the royal Saudi family, they gave the Clinton library around $10 million. And the Clinton Foundation also took in between $1 million and $5 million from the government of Qatar. So in light of Clinton's emails, well, should the Clinton Library and the Clinton Foundation return the money that they got from those two countries at least?Here with reaction, the author of ""Defeating Jihad, The Winnable War,"" Dr. Sebastian Gorka. Dr. Gorka, good to see you, sir. I think the answer is obvious, but I don't expect it's going to happen nor do I expect the corrupt media to ever ask her.DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, AUTHOR, ""DEFEATING JIHAD"": Sean, don't hold your breath on that one. I absolutely agree. But we have the smoking gun now.  Every delivery of new WikiLeaks emails gives us more and more evidence that her whole campaign is built on a lie, and basically America's national interest will be on the auction block. If she becomes the commander in chief it will be the highest bidder, whether it's the Saudis, whether it's the Russians, look at the uranium deal, whether it's the disasters, amoral behavior of the Clintons with regards to Haiti and the monies that were funneled into Haiti for their buddies. This is a campaign that is not about America. It's about their corrupt organization.HANNITY: It really is. And when you think of the level of corruption here, one of the things that I am shocked never come up is all the money she's taking from all of these countries where women can't drive, like Saudi Arabia, women are told how to dress, women are told that they can go to school or work but men in their lives. Gays and lesbians are killed for being gay and lesbian. Christians are persecuted. Jews are persecuted.  You can't build a temple or a Christian church. And she still took the money, and clearly they bought her silence because she never criticizes them. Isn't that the height of hypocrisy?GORKA: Sean, but remember, the hypocrisy isn't just international. It's domestic as well. So these are regimes that obliterate the rights of women. She accepts tens and hundreds of millions of dollars from these kinds of actors, these kinds of countries. And then on top of that, what happens to the women who accused her husband of rape and sexual assault?  It's completely hypocritical whether it's international or domestic.  Either you're a feminist and you stand up for women's rights in Saudi Arabia and America, or you're not, Sean.HANNITY: And by the way, you can't vet refugees, either, and she's friends with Putin. Unbelievable, isn't it?GORKA: When she said in the latest emails that Jordan, which is right next to the warzone cannot vet refugees privately, and then denies that in public and says let's increase the refugee stream by 500 percent, when she says privately that no fly zones are impossible in Syria, but publicly makes that a platform of her national security campaign, we know, we know that it's not about America, Sean. It's about Hillary Clinton.HANNITY: Dr. Gorka, always good to see you. Thank you, sir.When we come back, Newt Gingrich and his wife, Callista, they're here as we continue straight ahead tonight on HANNITY.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" Newt and Callista Gingrich have released brand new books made for all ages. Now, Newt is a thriller called ""Treason,"" And Callista has brought back Ellis the Elephant. And her brand new children's book is titled appropriately with the election coming up ""Hail to the Chief."" They join us now. You guys go on book tours together.  You're inseparable.CALLISTA GINGRICH: We really are, Sean.HANNITY: Is Ellis back on the campaign trail with you, on the book trail?CALLISTA GINGRICH: Ellis the elephant is back in book number six in Ellis the elephant series. And this time Ellis learns all about our American president and how they've lead our country throughout history. And the book is called ""Hail to the Chief.""HANNITY: And I pray that Ellis doesn't have to cry if Hillary is elected.  I'd hate to see a grown elephant cry.(LAUGHTER)CALLISTA GINGRICH: Ellis is very strong.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: And you know, you're the great historian. My first interview with you was in 1990.

But you use your knowledge of history and current events and you put these novels together that make them extraordinarily real and compelling. You write page turners.
