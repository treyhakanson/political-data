This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, it is decision time here in the United States of America. Now, three of Donald Trump's children, Don, Jr., Ivanka, Tiffany -- they'll be here. That's all coming up.But first, I want to lay out my closing arguments about what is at stake in this election. This is as big a choice election as I've seen in my lifetime. It's a choice between Donald Trump, a candidate who says he'll drain the swamp in Washington and bring about real change, or Hillary Clinton, the most corrupt career politician that's ever run for this office, and if she wins tomorrow probably will face years of intense scrutiny, congressional investigations and maybe even impeachment.Now, Clinton is the epitome of everything we hate about politics. And while her campaign is celebrating FBI director James Comey essentially so-called closing the case into her private e-mail server, let me remind you that the bureau has been investigating pay-to-play allegations at the Clinton Foundation for the past year and will pursue that probe no matter what happens tomorrow.And by the way, five foreign intelligence agencies -- they have access to those e-mails. Now, WikiLeaks also exposed Bill Clinton, Inc. Remember that, the elaborate scheme directly tied to the foundation that Bill Clinton used to fatten his own paycheck, $116 million?And then there's Hillary Clinton's daughter, Chelsea Clinton. Well, she appears to have been using foundation money, which is intended for charity, to pay for her wedding and her living expenses for up to a decade. And according to the Associated Press, remember when Hillary was secretary of state? 55 percent of nongovernment people who met with her -- well, they were people that either gave money to the foundation or pledged money to the Clinton foundation.There's also the tens of millions of more dollars that the Clinton Foundation has accepted from countries that treat women horribly. They kill gays and lesbians. They persecute Christians and Jews, all treated horribly, not the mention, as WikiLeaks has exposed, the mainstream media is now completely in the tank for Hillary Clinton, and it is way worse than any of us could have imagined, especially CNN. And we'll deal with that after the election.Now, the abusively biased news media barely covered WikiLeaks and the Clinton scandals. So what makes you think they'll actually do it if she's occupying the Oval Office?Now, last night, we found out from WikiLeaks that CNN solicited the DNC for tough questions to ask Donald Trump, Senator Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina. Now, it's pretty clear they'll do anything and everything to protect Hillary Clinton.And speaking of the corrupt media, now, they've been saying this race is over, but that could not be further from the truth. I think this race -- so all of you understand, this is a winnable race for Donald Trump tomorrow. Now, the path to 270 electoral votes is not easy, but it is possible.Now, back in 2008, if you recall, I tried to warn all of you. I wanted to warn the country about how radical President Obama was. My warnings -- they apparently weren't enough. Remember I tried to warn you about Frank Marshall Davis and Reverend Wright and Alinsky disciple that he was and Acorn, and you know, the church of GD America, Bernadine Dohrn, Bill Ayers?  I was right about how terrible he'd be for this country, and Hillary Clinton -- that's going to be more of the same.If you elect Hillary Clinton tomorrow, you're going to get the government you deserve. And guess what? Anybody that helped support her, you own it!Look at the economy, for example, of Barack Obama, the lowest labor participation rate since the 1970s, almost 95 million of our fellow Americans out of the labor force, the worst recovery since the 1940s, the lowest home ownership rate in 51 years, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more Americans in poverty, over 43 million Americans total in poverty, one in five American families don't have a single family member in the workforce, one in six men, 18 to 24, prime working years -- they're either in jail or living in mommy And Daddy's basement. And by the time Obama leaves office, this president will have accumulated more debt than 43 other presidents before him combined!Now, here's how Donald Trump plans to fix this. He's going to lower taxes, reform the tax code. We're going to go from seven tax bracket to three tax brackets. Trump will end the burdensome regulation. He'll push for 4 percent GDP growth. By the way, Obama -- the first president in history not to have a single year of 3 percent GDP growth.Trump wants to create millions of jobs right here in America, insisting on free and fair trade. He'll incentivize those multi-national corporations and, he's going to allow them to bring back not millions, not billions but trillions of dollars into our economy with a low one-time 10 percent tax.  That means factories and manufacturing centers will be built here.Donald Trump -- he's talked about becoming energy independent, the lifeblood of our economy. That means we'll have fewer wars in the Middle East that we'll have to participate in. He'll expand coal mining. He'll expand domestic drilling, fracking, new technologies.Hillary, the exact opposite. Now, she's promised to raise taxes $1.2 trillion, spending $1.4 trillion. She's against lower tax rates for corporations. That means corporations won't invest here. She brags about putting coal miners out of work and coal companies out of business.  Remember this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean, renewable energy as the key into coal country because we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now we've got to move away from all of the coal and all the other fossil fuels.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Yes, great, if you're a coal miner, you're out of work now if she becomes president. Now, she's against domestic drilling. She's against fracking. Pennsylvania, you make a lot of money from fracking and a lot of jobs have been created because of fracking. She obviously would rather that her Saudi rich donors -- that they get the money instead of Americans getting good-paying jobs and careers.She also supports terrible trade deals. How about the disaster that's ObamaCare? It has destroyed America's health care system. Remember the president and Hillary -- they said you can keep your doctor, keep your plan. The average American family would save $2,500 a year. But guess what? We know it's all a lie! Millions have lost their doctors, millions have lost their plans, and on average, the average American family has seen their health care premiums go up on average $4,100 per family! And the White House just admitted a few weeks ago that the premiums are going to skyrocket next year by double digits.And yet Hillary -- she defends it. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I take that really as a challenge because before there was something called ObamaCare, there was something called ""Hillary care.""(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And we worked really hard to provide universal health care coverage.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: ObamaCare, ""Hillary care,"" call it whatever you want, a complete and utter disaster. Well, Donald Trump, he wants free market competition to make it affordable for everybody. Competition will help.  You get more coverage for less money.Next the Supreme Court. What has Donald Trump promised? He promised justices like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. They're originalists!  They believe in separation of powers, coequal branches of government.  Clinton wants the exact opposite, liberal activists who believe in legislating from the bench, people that would cite foreign law to justify their activism! That's not constitutionalism.Now, the choice for our country could not be clearer. Now, let's talk about national security. For example, when it comes to refugees, we've had the FBI director, the assistant FBI director, the director of national intelligence, the CIA director, the former special envoy to defeat ISIS, the House Homeland Security chairman have all said ISIS will infiltrate the refugee population like this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL, R-TEXAS: Would that -- bringing in Syrian refugees pose a greater risk to Americans?RASMUSSEN: I mean, it's clearly a population of concern.STEINBACH: The concern is in Syria, the lack of our footprint on the ground in Syria that the databases won't have the information we need.  So it's not that we have a lack of process. It's there's a lack of information.REP. KATKO: And that obviously raises grave concern as to be able to do proper background checks of the individuals coming into the country.STEINBACH: Yes.JAMES CLAPPER, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR: I don't obviously put it past the likes of ISIL to infiltrate operatives among refugees.JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: We can only query against that which we have collected.  And so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interests reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but we're not going to -- there'll be nothing show up because we have no record on that person.WOLF BLITZER, HOST, CNN: There is some fear, some fear that some of these refugees may actually be posing as refugees, but they might actually be al Qaeda or ISIS terrorists trying to sneak into Europe or the United States.  What do you make of that?JOHN KIRBY, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: Well, certainly that's a possibility. I mean, you can't dismiss that out of hand.GEN. JOHN ALLEN: We should be conscious of the potential that Daesh may attempt to embed agents within that population.JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: The group is probably exploring a variety of means for infiltrating operatives into the West, including in refugee flows.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, even Hillary admitted in private we can't vet these refugees! In other words, she's willing to gamble with our life. Donald Trump, he supports extreme vetting of refugees, especially ones coming from countries in the Middle East that have a whole lot of jihadists and represent a clear and present danger. Have we not learned anything from Europe? Hillary apparently hasn't. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Look, we're facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and I think the United States has to do more. And I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That make you feel safer? What she just said is a 550 percent increase! So why doesn't Hillary listen to our top intelligence and defense officials? If these unvetted refugees kill you, the American people, attack our homeland, she would be responsible.What about border security and Trump's promise to build a wall? A country without borders is not a country, and Hillary has bragged she wants to build bridge and not walls! Give me a break. Now, if people can walk across the border looking for a petter life, so too can America's enemies.  Now, the president's job is to protect the homeland, the most important job they have.But it's not just the country's security that's impacted. There are what, 11 million, the number of illegal immigrants in the United States? Guess what? That's costing you, the American taxpayer, a fortune, almost $113 billion a year in education, health care, criminal justice costs alone.It's time now to put America first. We can't afford it any longer.  Obviously, Mexico won't write us a check to build a wall, but with Trump's tough trade deals, well, hopefully, they'll more than pay for it.Now, the military -- it is in a drastic decline. It is time to modernize America's weaponry with these most technologically advanced equipment we can develop. Donald Trump has vowed to make this happen.And when it comes to foreign policy, Clinton, Obama -- they have such a long list of failures. What about that Russian reset? They gave the number one state sponsor of terror, Iran, $150 billion so they can continue to spin their centrifuges? What about Syria? What about the red line?  Well, they did nothing when Assad crossed it. And Obama and Clinton gave Mohammed Morsi -- remember him, former president, Egypt -- he was part of the Muslim Brotherhood. Well, they gave him F-16s and tanks and $1.5 billion of your dollars.Now, North Korea -- they don't respect us. China -- they have territorial ambitions. They have no fear of the United States under Obama or Hillary.  And then there's Benghazi, which happened under Hillary's watch, four Americans dead, and at this point, it makes a difference.And that's not all. The country is divided like never before, and you know what? The people in the front line of dividing this country, rich versus poor, old versus young, black versus white, men versus women is Obama and Hillary Clinton. How often have we seen them play the race card? She's been pitting people against each other again and again, trying to paint Republicans, conservatives as being bad for the African-American community.Now, this has all been done to distract African-Americans and the American people from the fact that under the leadership of Obama and Clinton, African-Americans on food stamps has gone up -- look at this -- 58 percent.  African-Americans not in the labor force, 18.5 percent.And like every four years, Democrats -- they play the race card to get votes. Well, Donald Trump has promised a new new deal with African- American voter. He promises safe communities, high-paying jobs and a good education. And when it comes to education, what did Trump promise? He said he wants to get rid of Common Core, top down, NEA education. He'll let you, American parents and teachers and local communities and states -- you get to decide how to run your schools, and they'll send education back to you where it belongs.Hillary, on the other hand -- free college. Everything is free in Hillary's world. No realistic explanation, of course, how she plans to pay for it all.I'll say it again. This is a choice election. When it comes to the economy, it's Trump who will cut taxes, Hillary will raise taxes. Energy - - it's about energy independence, the lifeblood of our economy, or dependence, and that would be a disaster.ObamaCare --  repeal it, replace it, or keep it and double down on it.  I don't think that's a good idea. When it comes to the Supreme Court -- hang on one second -- this will impact this country for generations!  Donald Trump wants originalists, Hillary wants activist, liberal, Acorn, Alinskyites sitting on the court legislating from the bench!Fighting Islam, radical Islam, do you want a commander-in-chief who's not afraid to call out our enemy for what they are and who they are? Refugees -- do you want people to be extremely vetted to keep you safe or not? When it comes to the military, should we rebuild it or allow our military to continue its decline like Clinton will take us?What about America's role in the world? Do you want us to be first or not?  You OK with America's decline, educating our kids. Should we be -- if we're paying the most money per capita, shouldn't we have the best test scores? But we're, like, 18, 22 and 25. And we spend more money than any other industrialized country.Now, in my mind, tomorrow is an important day. The answer couldn't be more clear. So if you're in a swing state, if you're in Florida, if you're in Ohio, if you're in Iowa, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, if you're in Maine's second congressional district, North Carolina -- we need you. It's up to you. You can decide tomorrow to save America from the declining state it is in and stop this downward spiral!That's what this election is about. Tomorrow night, if Hillary Clinton is elected, those who didn't support Donald Trump voted for Hillary or never Trumper, I'm telling you right now, you own her Supreme Court! You own her unvetted refugees! You own her tax increases! You own her open borders!  You own ""Obama care"" and you own her energy independence (sic). You will own it!Now, we got a lot coming up tonight. Trump takes his message to a lot of swing states. Today, Laura Ingraham is here with reaction. Plus, three of Donald Trump's children, Ivanka, Don, Jr., Tiffany will be here tonight.  All of that plus Rudy Giuliani as we continue this election eve.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: This election will decide whether we're ruled by a corrupt political class or whether we are ruled by yourselves, the people.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Oh, we're going to have a great victory tomorrow, folks.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: We're going to have a great victory. They have no idea. This is considered -- in the history of this country, this is actually -- and you've been hearing it. This is considered the greatest movement.  Nobody's ever seen anything like this, folks.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Nobody's ever seen anything like it.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump out on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania. That was earlier tonight addressing voters before they head to the polls tomorrow.  And he doesn't even need Jay Z using the N word or the F word or any other word. And he doesn't have Bruce Springsteen. He doesn't have Jon Bon Jovi, whatever his name is.Anyway, here with reaction, Fox News contributor, editor-in-chief, Lifezette, and nationally syndicated radio host Laura Ingraham. I...LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: ""Living on a Prayer"" -- Jon Bon Jovi.(LAUGHTER)INGRAHAM: That's Hillary Clinton's campaign at this point, living on a prayer.HANNITY: What do you think?INGRAHAM: I think when you watch what happened over the last just 48 hours, and the difference between the rallies -- like, at any given hour, it is Trump with the people. There's really not many other people with him. I mean, I was at a rally last night at -- well, not yesterday -- this morning at 1:00 in the morning in (INAUDIBLE) Virginia.HANNITY: 1:00 in the morning in Virginia, right?INGRAHAM: Yes. It was, like, myself, Raman Royal (ph). Our families -- we went and you had to walk, like, two miles to get there. It was crazy.  People streamed -- thousands of people walking on this dark road, a dirt road. And I've never seen anything like it except at, like, a music festival, like, a Coachella kind of thing. It was insane. Only about 2,500 could get in, and there were 12,000 people outside in the cold.But those were people making a last stand for America, Sean. You talked about it in your monologue, which was, by the way, phenomenal. I'm posting it on my Facebook page -- phenomenal.And with Hillary, she has a lot of bells and whistles. No doubt about it.  She has a very popular sitting president. It would be nice if we had a former president who was campaigning with our nominee.HANNITY: It would be nice.INGRAHAM: And she has a lot of celebrities. But what she doesn't have is the heart of the people. I really don't think she has that. She has the accoutrements. She has the name ID. And she has the big donors. Trump has the people, the working people, the people who put in the long hours...HANNITY: Have been screwed? The people who have been screwed?INGRAHAM: ... who've had their wealth and opportunities offshored and who've been really poorly served by, in many ways, both parties. And he's standing with those people in the cold and on the dirt road as they trudge up those fields to these rallies, he stands with them against the GOP establishment, the Bushes, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Chamber of Commerce, Hollywood, academia, the entire Democratic establishment and a lot of the Republicans in -- you know, a lot of senators...HANNITY: Republican establishment.INGRAHAM: Pat Toomey didn't really stand with him. And you know, God bless, but he's pretty much against all of these people for America, all these groups for America, the American working class. It's pretty inspiring. I mean, and I think regardless of whatever happens tomorrow, we're never going back. I mean, all these people...HANNITY: You and I agree.INGRAHAM: Oh (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: This is just the beginning.INGRAHAM: No, no! The big government, Republicanism and our friend Bill Kristol and, like, all these other people that no one knows their names, but these never Trumpers (INAUDIBLE) Oh, we're going to get back there and then we're going to go into this country and that country and we're going to spend all this money! It's over, folks. It's over. You had your time.  It didn't work.These policies don't work. Hillary is going to continue a lot of these same policies, Sean, and they're going to fail and America is going to be more unhappy, less prosperous, China's probably going to be a lot more powerful.And then in four years, we're going to have a decision to make all over again if Hillary Clinton should win. If Donald Trump wins, we actually have a chance to begin turning this around. It's going to take a while.  That's exciting.And regardless of what happens, the people who showed up at these Trump rallies, they were maligned, they were ridiculed, they were called deplorable, they were sneered at, laughed at and absolutely dismissed by Hollywood, the entertainment class, the Democrats, many of the Republicans, and they did it anyway because they love this country and they're magnificent people.That is a great testament of what was started by Donald Trump. I think he has a really good chance to retire the Clintons once and for all. I mean, I'm really excited...HANNITY: I do, too.INGRAHAM: ... about (INAUDIBLE) regardless of what happens. And you've done an amazing job...HANNITY: I think...INGRAHAM: ... of holding up the mirror to the failures of both parties.HANNITY: Honestly, the three -- four of us -- well, there's a few more -- you, me, Newt, Monica Crowley, Larry Elder...INGRAHAM: Bolling.HANNITY: Yes. There's been a -- there's- I don't -- I'm going to forget names...INGRAHAM: Drudge.HANNITY: ... and I don't want -- Matt Drudge -- and we've been -- you know, a lot -- I am starting tomorrow...INGRAHAM: Yes.HANNITY: ... the Republican Party names are being named. They -- what they did is disgusting.INGRAHAM: They should have stood with their nominee.HANNITY: What the media -- CNN getting questions...INGRAHAM: Oh, all the questions!HANNITY: ... from the DNC?INGRAHAM: All the questions.HANNITY: And then giving questions to Hillary? CNN is over!INGRAHAM: They should not host another presidential debate.HANNITY: Ever!INGRAHAM: CNN -- and the Republicans, you let the foxes back in the henhouse...HANNITY: Right.INGRAHAM: ... you deserve what you get!HANNITY: You do.INGRAHAM: And -- and -- and all these CNN executives are, like, Oh, well, this is just an anomaly. No. That's how you operate. And it happened with people at Politico. It happened with John Harwood.HANNITY: New York Times.INGRAHAM: It happened with The New York Times. And Donald Trump exposed that. If it weren't for Trump, do you think we would have really known about all this? Probably not. I mean, WikiLeaks is obviously responsible for getting these revelations out, but Trump exposed so much about this collusion. That's really powerful.HANNITY: Collusion with the State Department...INGRAHAM: Yes.HANNITY: ... collusion with the Justice Department...INGRAHAM: The media.HANNITY: ... collusion with the media, collusion with the White House.INGRAHAM: (INAUDIBLE) Clinton's collusion! They're -- I mean...HANNITY: Romney...(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: I had a joke that Jeb should be picked as Hillary's running mate, and let's make it a official. I mean, (INAUDIBLE) 2016. What difference does it make?HANNITY: I'll start -- just to give a little hint of what's going to come later this week.INGRAHAM: Yes.HANNITY: The John Kasichs, the Lindsey Grahams, the Jeb Bushes make promises. How could we ever trust a word they say?You get the final word. Is he going to win?INGRAHAM: I think he has a really good chance of winning.HANNITY: I agree.INGRAHAM: No one else could have come as close as Trump. And the idea that Marco Rubio, who got destroyed by Christie in, like, 120 seconds (INAUDIBLE) home state. He was going to beat the Clintons. Never going to happen.But America now sees what's really behind the curtain. The only person who could have illuminated that and gotten these people out on a cold fall night is Donald Trump. Sean, you've done a great job.HANNITY: You, too. Laura, great seeing you.INGRAHAM: Absolutely.HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE) All right, when we come back, Rudy Giuliani will join us. And then later tonight, three of Donald Trump's children, Ivanka, Don, Jr., Tiffany will be here as we continue this election eve.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I'm asking you to dream big because with your vote, we are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for for your entire life...(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: ... because if we win tomorrow, we will be able to make America wealthy again, to make America strong again, to make America safe again and to make America great again!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump making his final pitch to voters in North Carolina, very important state, earlier today.Joining us now with reaction, fresh off the campaign trail -- you would think he's running for president himself because he's been in every state with Donald Trump and on the campaign trail himself -- former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani.Mr. Mayor, I laid out at the top of the show my final arguments. What's at stake here? What do you want to tell the American people...RUDY GIULIANI, R-FMR. NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Well, I think you laid them out beautifully. Sean, I give you A-plus in litigation summation.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: OK.GIULIANI: You got all of the arguments in. You got all the arguments in.  You left out a few about how corrupt she is. I'm kind of stunned by the latest revelations, you know, the maid who had access...HANNITY: Isn't that against the law?GIULIANI: ... to top secret material.HANNITY: Is that against the law?GIULIANI: It's a crime -- it's a crime, Sean...HANNITY: Yes.GIULIANI: ... never investigated by the FBI. I guess they don't investigate crimes anymore. She never has been put before a grand jury, a crime for Hillary and the maid. How about stealing money from the Clinton Foundation to pay for Hillary's wedding? I mean, there are a lot of...HANNITY: For Chelsea's wedding.GIULIANI: For Chelsea's wedding, rather. There are a lot of middle class people there at home who saved a lot of money all their lives to pay for their daughter's wedding out of their hard-earned cash. They were multi- millionaires, and they stole money from the Clinton Foundation, that supposedly does good work...HANNITY: Apparently for a decades.GIULIANI: ... and supports Chelsea for a year.HANNITY: Well, apparently...(CROSSTALK)GIULIANI: ... also Cheryl Mills on the payroll, Huma Abedin on the payroll. I mean, come on. This is the difference between probably the most crooked family in American politics trying to get control of the White House again so they can sell the Oval Office the way they sold the State Department, or a man who can transform America and really make possible for us our greatest aspirations, a great America, an exceptional America, a good America, not this globalistic model that she has, which, by the way, if you bother to read the speeches she was hiding and getting paid a lot of money for, she's in favor of not just Obamacare. She's in favor of socialized medicine.HANNITY: Oh, yes, big time.GIULIANI: She wants us to have a medical system, she even said it to a Canadian bank, ""like Canada.""HANNITY: Let me ask you this, Mr. Mayor.GIULIANI: The Canadian health system is a health system where you wait in line for treatment.HANNITY: They come here for treatment. They come to America to get treated more expeditiously.Let me ask you this. Assuming he wins Iowa, assuming he wins Ohio, assuming he wins North Carolina, assuming he wins Florida, what state will take him over the top? Which states?GIULIANI: Well, you left out New Hampshire. New Hampshire and the one vote in Maine.HANNITY: Those are two important areas.GIULIANI: That's five. That gives you five votes. I was in Pennsylvania all day today. I met him -- I left him at the incident the other night when the gun was thought to be in the audience. And then I went off and campaigned on my own in Nevada all day on Sunday.HANNITY: How do you feel about November?GIULIANI: -- Nevada. I feel good. We always come in late, Republicans.  And I think he's peaking within, an old Nixon term by the way, I think he's peaking at just the right time. I think that the fervor is about as high as it's ever been. I think he's going to go in tomorrow with a big, big, big, big vote.HANNITY: Mr. Mayor, it will shock the world. The world is watching.GIULIANI: It will shock the world and it's going to happen. And I predict by two states. It's not going to be just one state. He's going to win by two.HANNITY: All right, Mr. Mayor, I know you worked hard.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: You probably deserve a vacation after this. I'll tell Donald to send you down to Mar-a-Lago. Thanks for being with us.GIULIANI: I'll tell you what, how about we both go to Dural we play a little golf.HANNITY: I've never been to one of his facilities. I've never got an invitation in my life. But I'll take it. I'll go.GIULIANI: We'll go to Dural and I'll play it with you.HANNITY: We'll play a round a golf. All right, thank you, Mr. Mayor.And three of Donald Trump's children, Ivanka, Don Jr., Tiffany, they'll join us next and explain why their father should be the next president.  Their closing arguments coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You have one day to make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country to come true. You have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system and deliver justice. You will deliver justice for ever forgotten man, forgotten woman, and forgotten child in this nation.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Do not let this opportunity slip away. We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interest.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, Donald Trump earlier today campaigning today in the must win state of Florida. Tomorrow the nation will decide who will be the next president of the United States. And over the last few days Donald Trump and his family, they've been crisscrossing the nation and making their final push and their final arguments. Joining us now are four of Donald Trump's -- I'm sorry, three of them. We've got Ivanka, Tiffany and Don Jr. Guys, how are you all holding up? Ivanka, we'll start with you.  How do you feel about tomorrow?IVANKA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER: I feel incredible. I feel so energized. Today I was with Tiffany, we were in Michigan, then we were in two stops in Virginia and now we're here in New Hampshire. And I will tell you that the spirit and the enthusiasm and the energy and the love and the support has been so tremendous. We feel very, very good.HANNITY: Yes. It's been really a family effort. Don is working the least. I notice that he's only doing five or six stops a day.DONALD TRUMP, JR., DONALD TRUMP'S SON: I have only done 700 or 800,000 miles in the last few days.IVANKA TRUMP: And he doesn't let us forget it.(LAUGHTER)DONALD TRUMP JR.: You know I'm not with any five kids right now, right.HANNITY: I've been texting Don, I'm like ""What are you doing?"" He's like ""I'm here but I'm flying here, here, here, and here. I'll have a minute in two days from now."" How are you feeling Don?DONALD TRUMP JR.: Listen, I feel great. The warmth and the outpouring that we're getting from people, disaffected Americans that haven't had a voice in generations. They see that look of hope in my father. Watching them and watching them react to his message and even our message candidly when we're speaking in these places, it's really special. It's changed us a lot I think throughout the process. It's been a real growing process.  It's easy to take things for granted. We were raised not to do that, but even so when you see real Americans coming up to you this way, it's awesome.HANNITY: Tiffany, I know you've been working hard for you dad. How do you feel about the process so far?TIFFANY TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER: It's just been amazing. So inspiring to see so many people get behind the movement. Everyone is working hard and now it's up to everyone getting out there and voting.HANNITY: Have -- when I look at the polls and I look at the Electoral College, Don, I'll throw this to you, it is neck in neck. Is it nerve- racking? Where do you feel your dad breaks through? He's obviously up in Iowa. I like his numbers in North Carolina. I like his numbers so far early in Florida. Florida is going to be a two-point race either way at the end of the day. And Ohio looks pretty good for your dad. And now you of got to get to the final states. Which states are you feeling the best about considering you've been to all of them and then some?DONALD TRUMP JR.: I think we're making a serious play in New Mexico. I think we're making a serious play in pushing in Colorado. I was in Michigan earlier today, now in New Hampshire, and we're going back to Michigan later on tonight. But I was in Michigan today, and, man, the feeling is really good there too. So I think we can put some states into play that aren't supposed to be in play. So I think that can change the map, I think that can really change the dynamic of what we feel tomorrow night. I think it goes a lot later than perhaps a lot of people are thinking. So there's a lot of interesting stuff going on. But there are states in play that aren't supposed to be in play, and it's because we're reaching out to the real Americans who haven't had the voice.TIFFANY TRUMP: I would say to all of your viewers, turnout is so important. We hope everyone gets out and votes. Like you said, it will be close. But the response to my father's message has been so overwhelmingly positive. So we encourage everyone to get out tomorrow and really vote, because every vote matters.HANNITY: I'll ask specifically, how do you think in any way -- and I've seen a change in your dad from my perspective. I have known your dad a long time. Have you seen a change in your father? Any of you that want to weigh?IVANKA TRUMP: Oh, 100 percent.HANNITY: What is the change, Ivanka.IVANKA TRUMP: You can't go through this process. It's fundamentally changed me. You meet so many people and you hear their stories, and they're incredible stories. They're heartwarming stories, and then you hear devastating stories. And it's the fuel that motivates you. I see it every day.Yesterday my father was in six states. It's almost -- you know, he's like a machine. But he's buoyed and fueled by the energy of the people and by their belief in him as an agent of change.And look, 70 percent of this country believes that we're headed in the wrong direction, and he knows what to do to get the country back on track.  And the excitement and the belief in the potential of Trump leadership is amazing to him, and he's so encouraged by it. And it means so much to him.  And he'll never let Americans down.HANNITY: Tiffany, do you see a change in your dad?TIFFANY TRUMP: I think every day he continues to get more inspired by the American people and more touched, and it really is fuelling him to go out there and really want this and really want to make a difference for all of us.HANNITY: And by the way, he -- I think he does like eight states to Hillary's two. He's certainly like the energizer --DONALD TRUMP JR.: Sean, you can't even compare the two. And that's the way he's going to fight for the American people. Hillary has fought for special interest. She's fought for every elite class you can get. And this is what this election is. This is a rare and unique chance to bring an outsider into Washington, D.C., someone who is willing, able and ready to take on the D.C. cartel and break it up, because as conservative as I am, and you know him well enough, both sides have failed us. This is really about insider versus outsider, and we need an outsider to break up this system.HANNITY: He talks about draining the swamp.IVANKA TRUMP: He's beholden to nobody other than the American people, and he'll fight very, very hard for all of us.HANNITY: Hillary does need Jay-Z dropping the n-word and f-bombs and Beyonce and the Obamas and Bruce Springsteen to get a crowd. And it is interesting that your dad is filling up arenas all around the country. We have a couple more minutes with Ivanka, Tiffany, Donald Trump Jr. right after the break as we continue.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: As we continue on ""Hannity"" we continue with the children of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka, and Tiffany.Don, let me ask you this question because I know you and I talk a lot about politics and I've known you for a while. You watch what James Comey has done here. We don't even know if an investigation is ongoing into the Clinton Foundation and the pay to play scandal. We've learned through WikiLeaks CNN is asking the DNC questions for your father. We know that they really screwed over Bernie Sanders. We know that CNBC, MSNBC, the New York Times, almost the entire media establishment has been against your father and now, we can prove it. Is that hard to discover, all of the corruption at this level?DONALD TRUMP JR.: Well, it's been going on and following our opponent for decades. This isn't anything new. The stuff that's more recent is more troubling because it's actually in our face. And perhaps to me, as an American, what is more troubling is that so few people on her side actually care. I ask you whether it be the WikiLeaks, whether it's certainly the email scandal, if you, Sean, me, any of our kids, any of our grandkids, any of your viewers kids and grandkids did the same thing that Hillary Clinton did, they'd all be in jail.No one on either side of the aisle would contest that in my opinion. She's incredibly reckless, this, that, and another, but nothing's going to happen. And that's what the American people are rebelling against.  They're rebelling against that double standard, that standard that is held for the elite and the standard that's held for everyone else. That's so much of what this election is about. So it's not so much about the results. It's about the way those things are handled and managed. That's what scary to me as an American.HANNITY: It scares me, too. I've been in radio, my 30th year, 21 years now on Fox. And I've got to tell you, as much as I believed government was corrupt, I never knew it was this bad. Drain the swamp is probably the most-appropriate way to deal with that.All right, last question for all of you. I know you guys have got to run.  Ivanka, how hard is it to read a newspaper, to watch a news program, and people hammering your dad every day, but they don't really hammer Hillary, and there is so much that the WikiLeaks scandal that the media just ignored. How hard is it to hear that about your own father?IVANKA TRUMP: It's very hard. We're not a family of politicians. So I will say on a personal level I was probably a little bit naive when my father declared his candidacy as to what it meant to go through this experience. And it is incredibly hard. There is so much editorializing.  There's a lot of fiction that's put out into the universe about my father and our family. So it is heard.But I will say for all of that and all of that negativity, it's so counterbalanced by the love and the enthusiasm and the hope and the belief of the tens of millions of Americans who support my father. And that is also been an amazing thing for me to live through and experience. I'll go to a rally such as this one tonight in Manchester, and there is so much heart in that room. So that is the other side of the pendulum and ultimately that is much more meaningful to me.HANNITY: Last word, Tiffany?TIFFANY TRUMP: It's, you know, it was hard, but we know who our father is, and I think no tabloid will write anything that will make us doubt that.  So we know the truth.IVANKA TRUMP: It helps to know the man.DONALD TRUMP JR.: That is one thing I wish everyone could experience is the man that's the father, the man that's the grandfather, really the man that's been the employer to tens of thousands of people. Those people know him so well, and I wish the American people could see his sense of humor.  I think they see it there, but if those people all saw the way he really is, off the stage, at a dinner table.HANNITY: There's a great video about your dad hiring a former boxer, I'll urge people. I'll re-tweet it again tonight.Listen, good luck to all of you. By the way Ivanka, Tiffany, that guy that's to your left, he's running for office one day. I just want to give you a head's up if you want to distance yourself from him now.(LAUGHTER)DONALD TRUMP JR.: I need a decompression from politics.HANNITY: Guys good to see you, best of luck tomorrow. Appreciate you being with us.IVANKA TRUMP: Thank you.DONALD TRUMP JR.: Thanks, Sean.HANNITY: When we come back, we have more ""Hannity"" right after this break.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Unfortunately that is all the time we have left. You want a better country, go out and vote tomorrow. It is so important. If you're in those important states, if you're in Florida, if you're in North Carolina, if you're in New Hampshire, if you're in Ohio, and if you're in Iowa, if you're in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, if you're in Wisconsin, Colorado is huge, Nevada is huge, Arizona, huge, New Mexico -- you can come through and save your country. And you'll get the country at the end, in the end, that you deserve.We'll see you back here very soon. Bret Baier is up next. Have a great night.

3	3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/02/16/battle-for-supreme-court/	The battle for the Supreme Court	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" February 15, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi, I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching this O'REILLY FACTOR: Election 2016 Special.We're going to go right to our top story, the battle for the Supreme Court. The sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia, creating one of the biggest political fights in years over whether President Obama should nominate Scalia's replacement or leave it to the next president. President Obama is leaving little doubt about where he stands.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time. There will be plenty of time for me to do so and for the senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Meanwhile, the Republican presidential candidates are wasting little time drawing their own lines in the sand.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it. It's called delay, delay, delay.SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans and the stakes of this election for in year, for the senate. The senate needs to stand strong and say we're not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee.SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mitch McConnell has already made it very clear that we are not going to move forward until there is an election. And I think that's the right decision. The court can function with eight justices in the last year, within the last few months of the President's term. We should not be appointing Supreme Court justices.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Joining us now from Washington with reaction Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham and with me in studio Juan Williams my co-host of ""THE FIVE"".Juan -- there are four questions. Will he? Should he nominate? Will they? Should they delay?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Let's start with will he and should he? He should. That's his responsibility as president of the United States. That's what the constitution says that he should nominate and the senate should advise and consent. In this case have hearings and have a vote.BOLLING: He should. So will he now?WILLIAMS: Yes. And he will. And he said it.BOLLING: Mary Katharine, now let's take the senate. Will they and should they go ahead and delay this nomination, whoever it may be, whomever it may be?MARY KATHARINE HAM, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Look, it's perfectly within the rights of the President to say here is who I would like. And it's perfectly within the rights of the Senate to say yes, we will see what we can do about that. That's the process.And it's far from standard operating procedure to name somebody during an election year who will fundamentally change the ideological balance of the court when we have already started voting for a new president. The process has begun already.I do think there's plenty of precedent to say hey, we're going to stop including, by the way, t1he Democrats own pattern of aggressing when it comes to judicial nominees -- Borking which is the verb for personally assailing a nominee. Nuking the filibuster when it suited them and using the judicial filibuster when it suited them under Bush. There's plenty of precedent here for going hard on this issue and for sticking to their guns.BOLLING: And sticking -- Mary Katharine, let's stay on you. The politics -- what will it be perceived? In other words people have accused the Republicans of being obstructionists in the past. If they do it one way they can be clearly seen as obstructionists if they say we're not even going to hear this.What about if they just listen and say ok, let's talk about this nominee and let's draw this out a little bit?HAM: I think listening if fine. Frankly they did a fine job with Sotomayor and Kagan. Some argued for filibuster, I argued against it. They ended up doing that very smoothly with plenty of votes.This is a different situation and a different year. There's a Republican Senate for a reason because they won a bunch of seats because a punch of people were mad at President Obama. So there's plenty of backup from the voters to say hey, hey, hey, let's chill and look at this for a minute.WILLIAMS: Yes. And that's exactly the reason why you should have this go forward because guess what there are lots of people who voted for President Obama twice to be president for eight years not seven years and a few months but eight years. And under the terms of that vote the people have spoken about who is to nominate a Supreme Court justice.Mary Katharine, let me say I don't agree with what you just said about Democrats being aggressive in terms of handling nominees. I recall not only was Justice Kennedy approved in the last year under President Reagan but I think there have been 19 Supreme Court justices approved in the last year. And don't forget Democrats got the majority in the senate when President Bush was there and they approved two conservative nominees for President Bush.BOLLING: Let me just point out. Let's just clear this up -- Juan. That Kennedy was approved during the election year but he was nominated in the year prior.WILLIAMS: It was very close -- a matter of a few weeks.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Hold on.HAM: Let's also talk about President Obama and when he was a senator. He had a standard and that was for 60 votes for Justice Alito. So he maybe has to live by the standard he set. He is not going to like it. But that may be where this goes. This is how it works. There is a high threshold. This is a serious matter.BOLLING: Let's talk about President Obama here a little bit about the hypocrisy of what he is doing. Mary Katharine Ham points out that he voted to get a 60 vote threshold for Alito. Now I guess he is suggesting -- he is still isn't going to get the vote anyway.WILLIAMS: There never has been --BOLLING: Hold on, hold on -- here is my question for you though Juan. The President says he has a constitutional responsibility, yet he spent the better part of seven years going around the constitution on executive order, on immigration and the big one some would say on Obamacare.WILLIAMS: This is so fascinating to me. You have people who use executive orders far more than President Obama including President Bush, George W. Bush, President Clinton, President Reagan and yet you keep coming back to this.BOLLING: Because -- those presidents used it for things like declaring national holidays or declaring the day of this and what not. Not any president, at least in recent memory, has used executive order to change policy as dramatically as President Obama has.WILLIAMS: Because we live in such politically polarized times and we have and I think this is another example of it --HAM: Partly because of him.WILLIAMS: -- every time the President tries to do something the Republicans obstruct. When he responds you say this guy is a despot. He is he a king.Ham: Juan he uses executive power to turn his feelings into law at any turn. Hew routinely says -- he spurns Congress and then he does nothing to cultivate that relationship and then he says I'm going to come to you for a solid at this point late in my lame duck career. No, that's not how it works. You actually do have to cultivate that.WILLIAMS: Well who spurns who? I don't know who spurns who, Mary Katharine because it seems to me that it was Mitch McConnell who's leading the obstruction on this justice who is the one who said --HAM: That's why they approved the first two choices for --WILLIAMS: Forget that I'm elected to be the senate majority leader my job is to stop Obama from having a second term. Does that sound like someone who's serious?HAM: Where did Kagan and Sotomayor come from then?WILLIAMS: They were voted for a majority of the senate, right?HAM: Yes, Yes. Right.WILLIAMS: So what's to stop this now?HAM: Because we are in a different political climate and it's not standard operating procedure.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: The only thing different is the politics and Republicans don't want to see the court led by a liberal majority.HAM: That's exactly right. Nothing wrong with that because the American people have suggested that they like Republicans in charge of the Senate and now they're in charge.WILLIAMS: And who elected President Obama, the liberals then or the Independents.HAM: That was two years before.BOLLING: Stay on this for one second, guys. I have to wrap in about a minute. So very quickly, we're on the horn.Juan, what would be bad with a 4-4 Supreme Court, maybe for a year until there's a new president?WILLIAMS: Well, you know with the example going around town today is, what if you have another Bush versus Gore in the election? Why not expect that your Supreme Court should function, your Senate should function and your President should function and get it done.BOLLING: Mary Katharine, what about a 4-4 tie until the next president comes and sworn in.HAM: There's plenty of precedent for that as well. And if president was interested in functioning he could function on Obamacare in the normal process. He could function on executive orders on immigration in a normal process and go to congress. He doesn't do that.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: All right. We have to leave it right there. Juan and Mary Katherine -- great debate.

Mike Pence on final push for the White House; Chief Clinton strategist on campaign's ground game	"This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" November 6, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.  With just 48 hours to go until Election Day, we're live in our brand new Fox election headquarters here in New York.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the cusp of something that's so amazing.  WALLACE:  After more than a year of a polarizing campaign, America chooses.  At stake: the presidency, control of Congress, and the future of the country.  HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We will have change.  The question is, what kind of change are we going to have?  WALLACE:  Today the latest on where the polls stand, live reports from the trail, and interviews with both campaigns.  First, the Republican vice presidential nominee, Indiana Governor Mike Pence.  GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-IND., VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This country's coming together.  We're going to make Donald Trump the next president of the United States of America.  WALLACE:  Pence only on ""Fox News Sunday.""Then, Hillary Clinton's chief strategist Joel Benenson responds.  We'll discuss the campaign's ground game and last-minute drives to get to 270 electoral votes.  Plus, we'll ask our Sunday panel about early voting and the impact of the FBI's renewed investigation as Trump and Clinton make their closing arguments.  TRUMP:  She has no energy.  You know, you need energy to help this country.  CLINTON:  He has shown us who he is.  Now, we have to decide who we are.  WALLACE:  All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again today from New York City.  We're coming to you from Studio F, our brand new election headquarters here at Fox, where just two days from now, we'll be reporting the results as America decides who will be the next president of the United States.  In a few minutes, we'll speak exclusively with Donald Trump's running mate, Governor Mike Pence, and Hillary Clinton's top strategist Joel Benenson.  But we begin with Fox team coverage.  Mike Emanuel is with the Clinton campaign in Philadelphia.  But we start with senior national correspondent John Roberts, who's in Sioux City, Iowa, a state President Obama carried twice but Trump has a good chance of flipping Tuesday -- John.  JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you, Chris.  Yes, the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Donald Trump has a lead of about three points here in the state.  A Des Moines Register poll has him up by seven.  Some tense moments last night in Reno, when the Secret Service for the second time in this campaign leapt on stage to protect the candidate.  Remember it happened back in March in Dayton.  The situation here, they actually whisked him off the stage after somebody at the front of the crowd started yelling ""gun, gun"".  Apparently, they saw a protester reaching for something in his waistband.  They thought it might have been a weapon.  It turns out that it was only a sign, though.  Thirty-three-year-old Austyn Crites was detained by the police, later released.  He told a local television station that he is a Republican who does not support Donald Trump, was simply trying to hold up a sign that said Republicans against Trump.  Trump was off the stage for a few minutes but returned shortly thereafter, appearing none the worse for wear.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We will never be stopped.  Never, ever be stopped.  I want to thank the Secret Service.  These guys are fantastic.  (END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS:  Donald Trump begins his day in Sioux City, Iowa.  It's the first of ten stops in ten states that he'll do here in the next two days.  A last-second drive to try to get as many people out to the polls as possible, trying to expand the electoral map as well, going into places like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, also in Virginia.  But really, Chris, when you look at the map, it comes down to six states.  Donald Trump leads in five of those six states.  If he were to win those, win Florida, in which Hillary Clinton has a slight lead, and win Maine's second congressional district, he would get to 270 on the nose and win.  But consider this, Chris -- if he were to get all that and not win Maine's second congressional district, it would be a 269 tie.  So, everyone talks about Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania becoming so important.  This could come down to one congressional district in Maine -- Chris.WALLACE:  John Roberts reporting from Iowa -- John, thanks for that.  Now to the Clinton campaign.  Mike Emanuel is live in Philadelphia, and Pennsylvania has voted for the Democrat, a Democrat, in the last six presidential elections.  But the polls are tightening there too -- Mike.  MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, after weeks of tremendous confidence, the Clinton campaign is revealing some jitters about some typically blue states, including Michigan.  The Clinton campaign has announced Hillary Clinton, the former President Bill Clinton, and President Obama will all be making campaign stops there in Michigan after seeing the polls there tighten.  The former president will do an event today in Lansing.  Tomorrow, President Obama will try to get out the vote in Ann Arbor.  And the Democratic nominee will be in Grand Rapids tomorrow.  That after both Clintons spent time campaigning in Michigan this past week.It is worth noting a Republican has not won the Great Lakes State since 1988.  Last night, Clinton had another big name entertainer helping her to rally here in Philadelphia.  Singer Katy Perry did a get out the vote concert for Clinton.  Clinton told supporters that already more than 37.5 million people have voted and called on others to do their part.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  I believe they are standing up for a hopeful inclusive vision of America.  And I'm asking you to stand up for that same vision when you come out and vote on November the 8th.  It's your turn, Philadelphia.  (END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL:  It is worth noting that Pennsylvania is another blue state that Hillary Clinton is spending a lot of time and energy here ahead of Election Day.  She'll return here tomorrow night for a rally with the president and first lady on election eve -- Chris.  WALLACE:  Mike Emanuel reporting from Philadelphia.  Mike, thank you.  Joining me now from another battleground state, Virginia, is Trump's running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence.Governor, it's all about the numbers now.  And let's take a look at them in the latest Real Clear Politics average of national polls.  Trump is down two points to Clinton.  And you're losing narrowly in some key swing states.  Down just over a point in Florida, down 2 1/2 points in Pennsylvania, up less than a point in North Carolina.  There's no question that Trump and you have tightened the race, but the fact is you're still losing.  The question is, how do you go over the top?  What do you do in terms of specifically?  Who, which states, where, to go over the top in these final 48 hours?  PENCE:  Well, I'll tell you what, our secret weapon is the American people who are saying enough is enough.  I mean, I was here at a rally last night in Virginia.  We had an overflow crowd that was bigger than some of the rallies that I've seen out on the campaign trail over the last several months as I've campaigned for Donald Trump.  And, of course, you see the tens of thousands of people coming out with Donald Trump.  He'll have five rallies a day today and tomorrow all across this country.  We're taking a message to make America great again all across this country.  And I think literally, literally by the hour, the American people are recognizing this election is a choice between change and the status quo.  It's between a more -- stronger, more prosperous America with Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton is someone who will continue the same failed policies that have weakened America at home and abroad.  Now, we feel tremendous momentum.  WALLACE:  Governor, Governor --  PENCE:  This campaign is on offense, and I couldn't be more excited.  WALLACE: I do want to get to some specifics.  Hispanics are voting early in big numbers in a number of states.  Florida, North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada.  Are you worried that the polarizing remarks that your running mate, Donald Trump, has made since his opening announcement may come back to beat him?  PENCE:  Well, you know, I'm really not.  The truth is that Hispanic-Americans have the same concerns that every other American does.  And we want to get this economy moving again.  We want our country to be safe.  I was just down in Miami this last weekend, saw overwhelming support for Donald Trump, strong stand for freedom in this hemisphere, standing strongly against what the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton want to continue to do.  WALLACE:  So, you think all those Hispanics, sir, are coming out to vote for Trump and not for Clinton?  Really?  PENCE:  No, I'm saying -- I'm saying that the American people want change.  That's Americans coming from every category.  I literally saw it.  I stopped by and had some Cuban coffee at a classic stop in Miami.  Karen and I had a hard time getting through the place with people that were enthusiastic about Donald Trump's stand for a stronger America at home and abroad, getting this economy moving, and repealing Obamacare.  I talked to leaders in that community who are feeling the crushing weight of Obamacare.  Twenty-five percent increases in the premiums of Obamacare, Chris, in Florida and all across the United States of America.  The American people know we can do better.  It's going to take change in Washington, D.C., and I really do believe that's why you're seeing people from all across the spectrum, Republicans, independents, many Democrats, and people literally from every community in this country rallying behind Donald Trump more and more by the hour.  WALLACE:  Trump has been arguing that if Clinton wins, that she faces a criminal investigation and an indictment.  And here he is on the campaign trail.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis, what a mess.  I mean, we went through it with him with the impeachment, and the lies.  Aren't we tired of this stuff?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But, Governor, Trump has no hard evidence that she's going to face an indictment.  That's overstatement.  PENCE:  Well, Hillary Clinton and her foundation are under a current investigation by the FBI.  We just found out this morning that she had her maid print off classified information, according to revelations in The New York Post.  I mean, Chris, the American people know no one is above the law.  We commend the FBI for following the facts and reopening the investigation.  But I think this is part of the way the American people need to count the cost in this election.  Do we want more of the fast and loose ethics of the Clintons over the last 30 years, or do we want a clean break, do we want to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C., have fundamental ethics reform, and rebuild our military, revive our economy, repeal Obamacare and have appointments to the speak court that will uphold our Constitution?  This is all part of the equation that I think explains why you see such tremendous momentum in this campaign and why our campaign is literally expanding the map.  We're on offense.  And the Clinton campaign is literally on defense, trying to shore up blue states around the country in the waning days of the campaign.  WALLACE:  Speaking of criminal investigations and draining the swamp, two of Governor Chris Christie's top aides were convicted of fraud and conspiracy Friday in the Bridgegate case.  And given the fact that there was repeated testimony in that trial that Christie knew all about the effort to close the lanes to the George Washington bridge to punish a political opponent, are you comfortable with Christie as the chairman of the Trump transition team if he's elected?  PENCE:  Well, what I would tell you is Chris Christie has continued to strongly state his position that he had no knowledge of those actions taken.  And frankly, as he said late in the week, that what those convictions prove is that he was right to immediately fire those people for the actions that they'd taken.But, look, all of our focus is on Election Day.  I promise you.  And we're grateful for Chris Christie's role in the campaign, and we're going to all keep our head down and work hard to bring a victory for the American people.  WALLACE:  So, Governor, no chance that he'll be -- no chance that he'll be replaced after the election?  I mean, you're standing by Chris Christie despite all this evidence?  PENCE:  Look, there's no changes in personnel here in the waning days of the campaign.  We're 100 percent focused on bringing home a great victory for the American people, and Republicans are coming together, Chris.  I was yesterday with Speaker Paul Ryan in Wisconsin.  A couple days before, I was with Governor Doug Ducey in Arizona.  Last night here in Virginia with Ed Gillespie.  Republicans are coming home and recognizing that we need to elect Donald Trump as the next president, re-elect a strong Republican majority.  And Republicans are coming home with independence and Democrats at their side, to make sure that Hillary Clinton is never elected president of the United States.  The momentum is palpable out there.  And I'm looking forward to jumping on a plane, headed to Florida, North Carolina, and New Hampshire today.  Donald Trump is literally everywhere --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Well, before you do that, Governor, let me ask you one final question, if I may.  This has been a divisive and negative campaign.  You talk about the party coming together.I want to ask you about the country coming together.PENCE:  Yes.WALLACE:  I think you'd agree, one of the strengths of our democracy is when the election is over, no matter how ugly, the loser graciously concedes to the winner and we all rally around the new president, whoever that turns out to be.  Donald Trump has said different things at different times.  I want you to clear this up for us.  Can you guarantee that if there's a clear winner on election night and if -- and I repeat if, I know you're going to say, well, he's going to win -- but if Donald Trump should be the loser, can you guarantee that he will concede to Hillary Clinton and accept the result of the election and the judgment of the American people?  PENCE:  Well, thanks for anticipating my answer.  Donald Trump is going to win this election.  He'll be more than happy to accept the results.  But, look --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Can you guarantee that he will put this behind us -- sir, can you guarantee he'll put this behind us and accept the result?PENCE:  Chris, the campaign -- yes, the campaign has made it very clear, that, you know, a clear -- a clear outcome obviously both sides will accept.  But I think both campaigns have also been very clear that, you know, in the event of disputed results, they reserve all legal rights and remedies.  But the truth is that this is such an exciting time in the life of our country.  The way this country is going to come together is when we deliver the change that the American people long to see.  When we -- when we rebuild our military, we're standing tall in the world, when we revive our economy, when we have a Supreme Court that upholds our liberty, and we see America growing and prospering again.  WALLACE:  Governor --  PENCE:  When we see America great again, America is going to be united and we're going to move our nation forward.  WALLACE:  Governor Pence, thank you.  Thanks for your time, especially in this final weekend.  And safe travels on the campaign trail in these last 48 hours, sir.  PENCE:  Thank you, Chris.  PENCE:  Coming up, Hillary Clinton's top strategist Joel Benenson is here in Studio F.  And we'll check in with Bill Hemmer upstairs on the data deck with a look at the possible paths to the all-important 270 electoral votes -- as ""Fox News Sunday"" reports live from America's Election Headquarters.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  And we're back at Fox News Election Headquarters in New York City.  As the polls tighten just hours before Election Day, Hillary Clinton is fighting off Donald Trump's late charge.  Joining me now is Clinton's top strategist, Joel Benenson.  And, Joel, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""JOEL BENENSON, CLINTON TOP STRATEGIST:  Thanks for having me, Chris.WALLACE:  As I pointed out to Mike Pence, while they've tightened the race, they're still losing, the Trump side, but there are some numbers out there that are troubling to your side.  I want to ask you about those.  In the latest Fox poll, 71 percent of Trump voters strongly support him versus 65 percent of Clinton voters.  Sixty-three percent of Trump supporters are extremely interested in the race.  For Clinton, it's 54 percent.  And after news of the FBI investigation, 21 percent of independents are less likely to vote for Clinton.  Joel, there seems to be an enthusiasm gap, and the FBI investigation seems to be hurting Clinton.  BENENSON:  No, I think there are a lot of ways to measure enthusiasm.  You know, there's also a Washington Post poll.  And they've been tracking numbers historically.  Fifty-six percent of Hillary Clinton's voter saying they're voting for her as opposed to against her opponent.  Kind of on par with people like Al Gore and George Bush, Bill Clinton in '96.  That same poll shows Donald Trump at 41 percent.  That is historically and significantly lower than most presidential candidates.  WALLACE:  Do you think the FBI announcement, now a week and a half old, has hurt Clinton?  BENENSON:  No, I don't.  I think it obviously occupied a lot of air space, but I think, you know, we've been knocking on doors.  We have had lines all weekend at our phone banks with people waiting to get in.  We've knocked on 2 million doors this weekend.  I think where you're seeing the enthusiasm is in the early vote.  Our people are going out to vote, where the early vote is going on.  States like Florida, states like Nevada.  Very strong numbers and not just with our base Democratic voters, but we think we're seeing a surge with suburban women, younger people, millennials, broadening our coalition.  WALLACE:  OK.  Having said all of that, Clinton has changed her game plan these last few days.  I always say the most precious commodity in the last week of a campaign is the candidate's time.  She went to Detroit to campaign on Friday, which is somewhat surprising.  She's going back there again to Michigan, to Grand Rapids, on Monday.  You're now running TV ads in Virginia and Colorado and New Mexico.  Those were all states that were off the board for Trump two weeks ago.  BENENSON:  Well, here's -- going to Michigan, by the way, is very consistent with our plan because Michigan is one of the states we call game day states.  No early voting.  We have to make sure we get there in the last few days, keep people ginned up, getting them out to vote.  That's what you're seeing in some of these states.  In terms of ads in states like Virginia and Colorado, where we do feel we've got a winning margin there, we've had actually in the last two weeks a surge of resources, things have opened up for us.  More money is coming in.  Our digital fundraising has been great.  People are supporting the campaign.  And we're going to put those to work because our job here is every state we make harder for Donald Trump to win, makes his path narrower and narrower.  We've always wanted to be in a position, Chris, where we're not trying to thread a needle, we're not drawing an inside straight.  And so, we're playing offense in all of our states.  WALLACE:  Well, let's talk about that.  You heard me ask Mike Pence, how does he get over the top?  BENENSON:  Sure.WALLACE:  Let's go up to the data deck, up on the second floor here in our election headquarters, where Bill Hemmer is standing by to show us a possible Trump path to 270 and then, Joel, we'll come back and talk to you on the other side.  Bill?BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, hello.  And it's the mezzanine level.  We've super-sized the billboard this year for 2016.  You see all the states in gray on the map.  Those are the states where it's too close to call, the battleground states we believe as of today that's where the election stands.  Go back four years ago when Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama.  Romney flipped two states that year.  He made Indiana Republican again.  So, too, in North Carolina.  If you assume that Trump at a minimum has to hold all the Romney states, this is what it could look like -- 16 electoral votes in Georgia.  It's 11 in Arizona.  It's 15 in North Carolina.  And late on Friday, the Trump team tells me they feel very good about where they are in North Carolina.  More on that in a moment.  He'd have to flip the six in Iowa.  He'd have to flip 18 in Ohio, 29 in Florida, and still under this scenario, he's 11 electoral votes short.  So, where does he go?  If he were to win Pennsylvania, that would make him president.  If he were to win Michigan, that would make him president.  If he were to win a combination of, say, New Hampshire and Colorado, that would do it.  Or New Hampshire and perhaps Nevada would get him very close at 269 under that particular map.  However, if the Clinton team finds success on the East Coast, maybe in Florida, which could be deadly for the Trump team, or possibly turning North Carolina blue again, you start to see the challenge for Trump as he drops down to 244 electoral votes.  That means under that scenario, he would have to win Pennsylvania and somewhere else.  He would have to win a Michigan and somewhere else.  Two states, by the way, that have not gone Republican in 28 years.  The point is on all this, there's a number of different options that you can map out and gain for Tuesday night.  Trump, it's not impossible.  He has a number of ways that he can do it.  But it's much more difficult.  As it stands today, Chris, it is much easier for Hillary Clinton based on the map that we're watching.  Back to you.  WALLACE:  Bill, thank you.  Well, you heard about possible paths.  And all of them are difficulties.  He's kind of -- you talked about the political equivalent of drawing to the inside straight.  He kind of has to do it.  Where are the big kinks in that scenario?  BENENSON:  In his scenario?  WALLACE:  Yes.  BENENSON:  Pennsylvania.  Starts with Pennsylvania, number one.  Pennsylvania is a strong state for us.  We're going to be spending time there, as Bill pointed out solidly Democratic for six elections or so.  Because if he doesn't win there, he has to win all four of the big other states that Bill just talked about -- Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan.  He's not in a position to win all four of those.  He just isn't.  I think that some of these are close, no question about it.  He, I think, described the scenario I did.  It's not over until the fat lady sings, as they say, right?  And -- but we're going into election day playing offense, keeping them on defense with states like Arizona that we never played in before, not -- neither in the Obama election.So, we feel good when we're on offense.  We think we're in good shape.  And I think it's because voters around the country are really rejecting the divisive rhetoric that they've heard from Donald Trump throughout this campaign.  WALLACE:  OK.  That is the concern for Trump, the concern for the Clinton camp is the honesty and trustworthiness factor and obviously the renewed FBI investigation, as an issue.  And I want to discuss that for a moment.  Back in March of 2015, Hillary Clinton told the country that she had turned over all of her work-related e-mails to the State Department.  Here she is.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  I responded right away and provided all my e-mails that could possibly be work related, which totaled roughly 55,000 printed pages.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But the week before a Clinton adviser sent out this e-mail, ""If there is a release of the 55,000, are there others that are not being released?""  And here was your answer, Joel, ""Definitely.""  Now, Clinton --(LAUGHTER)BENENSON:  Actually, Chris.  The definitely wasn't to that.  There's a string of e-mails there.  It was saying to the previous e-mail that we should release all the e-mails.  I was saying definitely.  There was an interspersed e-mail in there.  I was responding to the previous one that said definitely.  WALLACE:  Why didn't they release all the e-mails?  They still got you (ph).(CROSSTALK)BENENSON:  I think they released all the ones they believed they had at the time.  I think during the course of the process -- and Director Comey said there may be some others, and if there are, they'll find them and be turn over.  But let me go back to your fundamental question here.  You raise a question of trust.  And I hate to, I apologize for bringing up a Washington Post/ABC poll.  But they asked, which one of these two people has stronger moral character?  And by 46 to 38 vote, it's an eight-point spread, Hillary Clinton is --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  As you know, as a pollster, it depends on the question that's asked.  BENENSON:  Well, it was, but strong moral character is a strong test for the president of the United States as well.  And I think people -- looking at these two people, we have an eight-point advantage there and people are looking at this through the prism of who are these two people.  What have they both done in their lives that will make me count on them --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  OK, I got that.  And I want to ask you a question about the e-mails because --  BENENSON:  Because you've never asked me before.  No, go ahead.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Well, I haven't asked you often about the e-mails.  The argument that she made and that the campaign has made that all of the deleted e-mails were personal, they were about her yoga, about Chelsea's wedding.  A question I have for you is, were e-mails about the Clinton foundation considered personal, and were they deleted?  BENENSON:  Chris, I'm not sure how they were considered.  What I know is that whoever is looking at all the e-mails has been looking at it for years, 15 months, almost a year and a half now, right?  They've said they're going to look at any other e-mails that come up.  And let them make a judgment.  When Director Comey spoke, he had no access to other e-mails.  He hasn't seen them.  He went out on a limb.  He's been criticized by both Democratic and Republican former law enforcement officials who said this was inappropriate to do at this point, particularly when he had no facts and no information.  Look, I think that voters are going to go to the polls two days from now, they're going to factor all this information in.  They're going to make the decision on which one of these people will really make America the kind of country they want to have.  WALLACE:  OK.  One last question: in February of 2015, there were reports that foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation were on the rise, and that resulted in a string of e-mails again I want to talk about.  Here was your recommendation about foreign government donations to the Clinton Foundation, ""Stop taking foreign government money.  Is that possible?  If not, we're going to be very vulnerable on that throughout.  And I think our opponents and some on our side will say it is unseemly for a potential U.S. president taking money from foreign governments for her private foundation.""Joel, you knew this was a problem, but as we sit here today, the Clinton Foundation continues to take money from foreign governments.  BENENSON:  Well, two things.  One, I'm not going to authenticate any of these e-mails.  We know we were hacked through Russian interference.  WALLACE:  OK.  BENENSON:  What the Clintons have said is they announced the steps they will take if Hillary Clinton is elected president.  They are very clear.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  But you were saying this in 2015.  Why not --BENENSON:  This foundation -- because this foundation helps millions of people around the world, President Clinton has put to work at that foundation what he learned as president with 11 million people on life-saving AIDS drugs.  WALLACE:  So, you don't think it's unseemly?  BENENSON:  I think that they are -- the Clintons have announced what steps they would take if she's elected on Tuesday, which I believe she will be, about the steps they will take to change the way the foundation will operate if she's president of the United States.  What they don't want to have happen is for millions of people who are being saved with life-saving drugs, kids getting better food in schools --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  But that was 2015 and you called it unseemly.  BENENSON:  Well, I said I'm not going to authenticate any of these e-mails that were hacked by Russians.  I'm going to talk about what the foundation has done and how they've addressed what they will do going forward.WALLACE:  Joel, thank you.  Thanks for coming in today.  BENENSON:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  WALLACE:  Always good to talk with you.  BENENSON:  Good to see you, Chris.WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what we should be looking for in these final hours of campaign 2016.  Much more to come from Fox News election headquarters.  Here's a look at what we call the chandelier -- uh-oh -- where we'll be making race calls throughout election night. We'll be right back.We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton make their closing arguments.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The vote that you cast will be the most important vote of your life.CLINTON: I have spent my career fighting for kids and families. And if you elect me, that's what I'll keep doing.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday group how they need to wrap up the race, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Stay on point, Donald. Stay on point. No side tracks, Donald. Nice and easy. Nice --CLINTON: His campaign probably put that in the teleprompter. Stay on point, Donald. Stay on point.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  In these final days of the campaign, Donald Trump giving himself a pep talk and Hillary Clinton making fun of it.And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, Dana Perino, co-host of ""The Five"" and ""I'll Tell You What,"" and the hardest working woman in show business is also the author of the new book ""Let Me Tell You About Jasper,"" and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams.Well, Karl, you've looked at all the polls, you've crunched the numbers on early voting, you've explored all the paths to 270, where is this race now?KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR: Donald Trump leads in the Mitt Romney states with 206 Electoral College votes, albeit it in one of those states, North Carolina, by only a point. But he also leads in Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Iowa. If he gets there, it's 240 electoral votes. Still short of the 270, but within striking distance.Twenty-nine electoral votes up in Florida. Today she leads by one. But Republicans have had good numbers in early voting there. They're down only 7,000 in the early voting. Four years ago, when Barack Obama won the state by 74,000, they were down 104,000 at the end of early voting. So Florida is very much up for grabs.I thought it was interesting that when you asked Joel Baronson --WALLACE:  Benenson.ROVE: Benenson about the most important states, he said Pennsylvania, not Florida. That seems to me that might be an indication that they're concerned about Florida. It is very much up for grabs. And the signal in the early voting points to a narrow Trump victory there.WALLACE:  Juan, what's your sense? Is Trump as close as Karl says? Is this race slipping away for Clinton?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I don't know if it's slipping away, but I think that if you looked a week ago, it was more like five to six percentage points. In the national polls this morning, ""Wall Street Journal"" has her up four. ABC/""Washington Post"" has her at five. Fox News Channel, our polling, has her up two. So what you see is that it has tightened.But most of the tightening has been a result of Republican consolidation of their vote. Republicans previously were about 70 percent -- 75 percent to 80 percent. Now they're up to 85 percent behind Donald Trump. I think, obviously, people like Paul Ryan, the speaker, Ted Cruz's former rival, and bitter rival, have now decided they're voting for Donald Trump. I think that's a signal, despite, you know, their concern about lack of qualifications, character, whatever.So, at the moment, you have it like, you know, she is in a position where most Americans, according to the Fox poll, think she's going to win, 56 percent. Only a third, 35 percent, think he will win. And the difference at this juncture, I think, is ground game. She really has a ground game. I don't think anybody thinks he has a sufficient ground game to push the numbers one or two points at the very end.WALLACE:  I want to turn to one of the biggest developments over these last ten days, and that was FBI Director Comey's shocking announcement that he's reopening the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton and the e-mails. Now, the White House said that President Obama wasn't going to weigh in on whether this was a good idea or not, and then President Obama did weigh in. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I do think that there is a norm that, you know, when there are investigations, we don't operate on innuendo, we don't operate on incomplete information, we don't operate on leaks.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Bob Woodward, as someone who has been reporting on the FBI since Watergate, what do you think of the role that the FBI and the Justice Department and apparently a lot of leaks in a kind of a war between the two agencies, of their role these last days?BOB WOODWARD, THE WASHINGTON POST: I -- I -- I think it will be many months or years before we really unravel what happened in this. But what Director Comey did is extraordinary, both times, back in July saying that she would not be charged. An old FBI hand, one of the iconic figures, told me the other day he thinks that's the first time the FBI made a prosecutorial decision. Normally it's the Justice Department that does this. So it's -- it's a big deal.I don't know whether it changes the race. I mean the number -- numbers that Karl has are -- are pretty convincing. I -- I think the question to kind of ask is, if Trump does win, how -- how is that possible? What's been missed? And I think I find in travels around the country talking to groups from Texas to Florida to New York, people don't trust the polls. And they look at voting as much more personal. They don't like the idea, oh, I'm in a demographic group, so I'm going to go this way. They want to decide themselves. And so there are people in demographic groups who will say, no, I'm not going with my group.WALLACE:  So you think they're lying?WOODWARD: I -- I think --WALLACE:  I mean lying to the pollsters.WOODWARD: I -- I think that's quite possible. I think also that, you know, you do all this by land line or cell phone, what sort of data do you get. I mean even The New York Times today is saying the possibility of Trump winning is real. So why are people hedging? Because they're unsure, aren't they?WALLACE:  Let me bring in Dana and your thoughts, one, about the state of the race, and, two, the FBI role, what do you think of it, and do you think it has hurt, whether you like it or not, do you think it has hurt Clinton?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": I think that it reaffirmed pre-existing beliefs about Hillary Clinton. So if you weren't going to vote for her and thought she was dishonest, that reaffirmed it and you might even be more encouraged to vote for it. and I think that that has happened at the same time, as Juan was saying, that Republicans said, all right, we might not think this is the best candidate we could have had, but by gosh we're going to go out and vote for him because that's what Republicans do.On the other side, I agree with Bob, I think it could take years to find out what happened at the FBI. But whoever wins the presidency has got to figure out a way to reassure Americans and restore confidence in the FBI because while they're doing this they also have said in the past year, James Comey, the director, said they have 50 states that they're looking at with open investigations with ISIS terrorist related things. So they have things to do.I think that two things might happen. Republicans have been trying to get Pennsylvania for a long time. And it's always the one that got away.WALLACE:  Right.PERINO: Wisconsin's in that category as well.WALLACE:  1988.PERINO: That's right. And for Democrats, I think that they still believe that Georgia and Arizona are the two. And I think they're actually probably going to end up with Republicans not winning in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Democrats not winning in Georgia or Arizona.WALLACE:  Karl, I've got about a minute left in this segment and I want to go back to the -- the narrative this weekend, and that is that the Hispanic vote is coming out in an unusually large numbers and the assumption is because of Trump's very polarizing remarks since his announcement that they're voting against him and for Hillary Clinton and could be the deciding factor.ROVE: Yes, that's half the important narrative. What we're also seeing is a decline in the African-American turnout. We're seeing it, for example, in Florida and North Carolina, where it is down. The African-American turnout down in those states. Hispanic turnout up.The -- the problem for the Democrats is, every time they lose 1 percent of Democratic turnout among African-Americans, they lose about nine-tenths of a point of support because they vote 90 percent plus for Democrats. Every time they gain a percentage point among Hispanics, they gain about seven-tenths of a percent. So for Democrats they're hoping the Hispanic turnout is rising significantly more than Democratic turnout is dropping among African-Americans.Let me make one more point. Pennsylvania, there have been 42 polls since October of 2015. Donald Trump has not led in a single one. Sixteen polls since the end of September in Colorado, not led in a single one. Michigan, 37 polls since October of last year, hasn't led in a single one. He got an uphill climb here at the end. I can see him getting to 240, but after that it's going to be a stuff slog (ph).WALLACE:  And let me tell you, he speaks as somebody who tried for Pennsylvania over and over.ROVE: It broke my heart twice. It broke my heart twice.WALLACE:  All right, we have to take a break here. Up next, we'll break down the battle for control of the Senate and what happens on Wednesday, can we put this ugly election behind us?Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about whether the country will rally around our new president, whoever he or she is? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I'm very excited. There are just three days left in this most consequential election. Are you ready?TRUMP: I'm asking you to dream big because your vote -- think of this, we are just three days away. Do you believe it?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  And now we're just two days away. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump making their closing arguments to voters in these final hours before Election Day.And we're back now with the panel.Well, it's not just the White House that's at stake on election night. Also control of the Senate and the fact is that the Democrats need a net pickup of five seats or four seats, plus vice president Tim Kaine to break any ties to take control. We have our resident Senate watcher, Karl Rove.What's it look like for you, and what are the key states you're going to be looking at?ROVE: Well, look, I think it's going to come down -- the Republicans, I think, are going to bank five seats that they need and it's going to come down to winning two out of the remaining seats. The -- the -- the three best shots are going to be --WALLACE:  You mean the Democrats are going to bank?ROVE: No, the Republicans are going to bank five seats.WALLACE:  OK.ROVE: Arizona, Ohio, Florida, Missouri, and Indiana.WALLACE:  Right.ROVE: And that will get them to 49.WALLACE:  Oh, OK.ROVE: And the question is, how do they get to 51. And -- and the -- the three best shots they've got, and they've got to take two out of three, are, first, North Carolina. Richard Burr versus Deborah Ross. Burr leads by 1.5 in Real Clear Politics. Interesting to watch early vote. Democrats, as of Friday evening, 12,000 fewer Democrat early votes than in 2012. Republicans, 151,000 more. This is in a state Romney won by 95,000.WALLACE:  All right, real quickly, Burr is the incumbent. That's a Republican seat. So the key is, can he hold on.ROVE: Can he hold on to -- all three of these are holding on. Or, excuse me, two of the -- two of them are holding on. The second one is New Hampshire, Kelly Ayotte versus Maggie Hassan. Ayotte, the incumbent Republican. Hassan the Democratic governor. Ayotte is up 2.4 points. She's led in seven of the last ten polls in October. This will be the most expensive per capita Senate race in the history of America. $120 million will be spent. It is (INAUDIBLE).WALLACE:  And, again, that's a Republican seat that they're trying to hold on to.ROVE: A Republican seat they've got to hold.WALLACE:  And then there's one seat that's a Democrat seat, Henry Reid -- Harry Reid --ROVE: Right.WALLACE:  The majority leader is retiring and Nevada's that.ROVE: Yes. Republican Congressman Joe Heck versus former Attorney General Masto. Heck leads by 1.4 in the Real Clear Politics average. He's led in seven of the 13 polls since October 1. The GOP has cut the Democratic lead in early voting by only 2,000. But this could be just like 2012. Barack Obama took the state in the presidential race and Republican Senator Dean Heller was elected.WALLACE:  So you think Republicans definitely get to 49. The question is can they get to 51.ROVE: Fifty-one, right.WALLACE:  Or 50 with president -- or vice president Mike Pence.ROVE: Right. Always -- always good to have an insurance policy, though.And, look, there are a couple of other races out there, but these are their best shots.WALLACE:  Juan, who takes the Senate? And do Republicans hold on to the House?WILLIAMS: I think it's close to a coin flip. But I would just point out that, you know, there are other prognosticators. New York Times, Charlie Cook, I have a lot of respect for, and they, at the moment, give the Democrats a slight advantage. When you look at states like Illinois with Kirk, Wisconsin with Johnson, Pennsylvania with Toomey, I thought Toomey was going to come back, but it doesn't look that way in the polls at the moment. So I would look, as Karl was talking about, Missouri I think is very close. North Carolina. I think Nevada is still in play. And Indiana at the moment it looks like Todd Young has taken the lead. But I -- I would never, ever turn --WALLACE:  And that's a Republican state that the Democrats are trying to take (INAUDIBLE).WILLIAMS: Right, that Evan Bayh is trying to come back. So what you get is a very tight race right now.WALLACE:  All right. Let's turn because we want to ask you -- we asked you for questions for the panel and we got a bunch on the issue of what's the country going to look like and will they unite around our next president. And most of the answers, frankly, or most of the questions, were pretty pessimistic. They kind of came in the -- it was like ""Jeopardy,"" they came in the form of answers.Rose Mead sent this on Facebook, ""no matter who is elected, we are a fractured nation. Half of our nation has values and a world view that is diametrically opposed to the other. There's no uniting the two.""Dana, do you share that pessimism?PERINO: I think that today I understand why people feel that way, but I also have seen the power of the ability, the American people, over and over again, to have a peaceful transition of power. There's going to be a lot riding on whoever the president is just to decide to do that. And I wish I was on their communications team, because I have some thoughts of how they might do that.I also feel that people -- if you look at that ""New York Times"" poll, 80 percent of the electorate is disgusted with this election. I think that come Thanksgiving, when people gather with their families, they'll remember that America is not just defined by its president, but by her citizens, and that they'll have a lot to be thankful for and whoever the next president is will get support.WALLACE:  Bob, you and I, as the two old codgers, or statesmen --WOODWARD: Right, we can't use that word.WALLACE:  We can't? We -- we -- codgers -- there's a codger (INAUDIBLE) that's wrong?WOODWARD: OK. I was thinking of another one.WALLACE:  OK. We have lived through a lot of divided times, Vietnam, Watergate, the 2000 election when a lot of people thought Bush's election was illegitimate. What are your thoughts about the prospect for this country uniting behind Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?WOODWARD: I think it's a matter of tone whoever becomes president. If -- assuming Hillary Clinton is going to win, she can't come in with the old retreads, all appointments, all the people who have been there and Clinton administrations. There's been a lot of criticism, and you see it in these e-mails, about the team around her, is it going to be -- can she -- could she say a new leaf. The same with Trump. If he, for some reason, becomes president, is he then --WALLACE:  It wouldn't be some reason. It would be because he got the majority of the vote.WOODWARD: Yes, yes, but it's -- you know, I mean Karl makes a convincing case, but, you know, I -- I think there's that unknown factor in there. And then he would have to do something big and dramatic and hopefully inside he would have the feeling, I broke the bank, now I'm president, let's do everything right, instead of this sexism and racism, which has been out of his own mouth for a long time.WALLACE:  Karl, nobody came in under a bigger cloud as the new president than George W. Bush with that election and the recount and the month and the Supreme Court. How did you guys try to unite the country when he finally was the winner?ROVE: The first person he called from the -- in the United States Senate was Ted Kennedy, first member of the House he called, Democrat George Miller of California, and talked to them about the issues that they could together work on. But it wasn't easy. And it requires presidential leadership from the start.Dick Gephardt, who was a good man, went on Tim Russert's ""Meet the Press"" and twice, after the Supreme Court came down on the 18th of September, twice was asked, is Bush the legitimate president of the United States, and he refused to answer the question. And yet, by June, by setting the right tone and by reaching out to the other side, Bush had passed his tax cuts in the Senate with a quarter of the Democrats in the Senate voting for it, by spending the time and the energy and the effort to specifically unite the country. Whoever this -- if Donald Trump wins, he's going to need a Norm Mineta, a Democrat who will serve in his cabinet. If she wins, she's going to need a Bob Gates, somebody who's a Republican or a Republican identifier to serve in her cabinet.WILLIAMS: let me just say quickly, I think the -- in the healing process, there's no getting away, even on this Sunday morning, from saying something needs to be done about what happened with the Russians and the trouble at the FBI is not going to be resolved without some serious effort by whoever's coming in.WALLACE:  Well, we're going to have plenty of time to discuss that next week.Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday back in Washington.Up next, the candidates try to -- try to stay focused in these final days on the trail as ""Fox News Sunday"" continues from our election headquarters in midtown Manhattan.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  And we're back in our election night studio with a look at the poll closings in the tower. Another part of our Fox News election headquarters. And we'll be tracking those poll closings, of course, closely throughout the evening.Well, this is marathon Sunday here in New York. And much like the runners winding through the city, the presidential candidates have been crisscrossing the country in their own sprint to the finish. And with just two days left, the pace is picking up on the trail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: The last time the Cubs won, women couldn't vote. I think women are making up for that in this election.TRUMP: I've had a great life, and now I want to give back to the country that I love. It's time. We have to -- we have to give back.PENCE: (INAUDIBLE).SEN. TIM KAINE, D-VA., VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: (INAUDIBLE).TRUMP: I saw somebody backstage. Big, strong, powerful. I said to the guys, you think I could take this guy in a fight? You think I could take him?BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: For a year and a half, Americans have had acid poured down their throat.CROWD (chanting): USA! USA!BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That guy didn't have a -- had never won a baseball hat or a seed (ph) hat until he started selling them.PENCE: We can't trust Hillary Clinton with our healthcare anymore than we can trust her with classified information.CLINTON: I stopped in to check him out. What are y'all doing?MELANIA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S WIFE: It is never OK when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied, or attacked.JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Doing what Donald Trump did, getting up at 3:30 in the morning and tweeting vitriol about a woman's body.TRUMP: I didn't have to bring J-lo or Jay-z. The only way she gets anybody.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (singing): I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire, 'cause I am the champion --TRUMP: Massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry.BRAD PAISLEY AND CARRIE UNDERWOOD (singing): The election is taking forever and ever forever and ever --UNDERWOOD: OK, we get it.PAISLEY AND UNDERWOOD (singing): Make it end.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  And one way or another, it will end in just two days.Be sure to tune to Fox News Channel for election coverage all day and night Tuesday.
