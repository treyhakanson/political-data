But as Mr. Trump might say, Hillary Clinton won -- that, I can tell you. She destroyed her main competition Bernie Sanders on the gun issue. Senator Sanders from Vermont, a gun-loving state, has not aggressively fought for gun control something the left fervently wants.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Senator Sanders did vote five times since the Brady Bill. Since it was passed more than two million prohibited purchases have been prevented. He also did vote, as he says, for this immunity provision.Everybody else has to be accountable but not the gun manufacturers. And we need to stand up and say enough of that.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Oh, the play here is this. If the federal government ever allows law suits against gun makers that would destroy the industry as liberal lawyers would sue into bankruptcy. That's how the left wants to get around the Second Amendment just so you know.On other issues, the debate was a stalemate. But I couldn't understand the lack of foreign policy questions by CNN. I mean Mrs. Clinton owns much of the foreign policy debacle that has unfolded. But questions about ISIS, for example were few.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS: I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq.CLINTON: We don't want American troops on the ground in Syria. What I said was we had to put together a coalition.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now, whenever you hear the word ""coalition"", you know nothing will be done -- nothing. That's code, kind of like Comprehensive Immigration Reform. That's code for amnesty.Last night it was apparent that neither Sanders nor Clinton have any attention of aggressively confronting ISIS just like President Obama. On the economy, however, none of the Democrats on stage would criticize President Obama directly. But all of them are not happy about the situation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS: Middle class of this country is collapsing. We have 27 million people living in poverty.CLINTON: This inequality challenge we face, we have faced it at other points. It's absolutely right. It hasn't been this bad since the 1920s. America has been knocked down and although we have made progress we are standing but not running the way America needs to.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: So whose fault is that? Who's been in office for seven years? Why didn't CNN ask that follow up question?Finally the e-mail deal was also played down but here a rehearsed answer stirred up the crowd.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS: Let me say something that may not be great politics, but I think the secretary is right. And that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails.CLINTON: Thank you. Me, too. Me too.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: They are sick and tired of hearing about it. Hey, Bernie - - the e-mail controversy goes to honesty and accountability. Maybe you haven't heard, Senator, but the FBI is investigating. I hope the bureau is not sick and tired of it.As The Factor reported last night, the Democratic Party strongly urge the debaters behind the scenes not to attack the frontrunner Mrs. Clinton and they did not. And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years. He joined the network in 1996 and is based in New York. Click here for more information on Bill O'Reilly. "	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
