This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT KHUZAMI, SEC DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT DIRECTOR: Today the SEC has charged six former top ex ecutives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with violations of the federal security laws. In its annual report for 2006, we allege that Freddie Mac misrepresented to the public that the subprime holdings were not significant. In fact the company's actual exposure was between $141 billion and $244 billion. That is about 40 to 70 times greater than what it told its investors and the investing public.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, HOST: The Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC charging six former top executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with securities fraud, accusing them of telling their investors, misleading investors, about how many high risk loan they held, which many say led to the current housing crisis. We are back with the panel. Start there. Fred, big deal?FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": This is a big deal and further evidence of what was at the root of the housing crisis and the economic collapse and the packaged loans, the subprime loans. Fannie and Freddie were right there. Wall Street played a big role, too. But a lot of interpretations of what was cause were it was all Wall Street. It wasn't all Wall Street. It was partially Wall Street and partially Fannie and Freddie and this is further proof of it.BAIER: Juan?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: The ratings agencies are in that, too. So a lot of people have guilty hands.But it's interesting you are finally seeing the SEC take action. A lot of people thought why do the Wall Street guys and bankers get away scot-free. It's time for somebody to pay a price. It's very interesting they decide now the is time.I wonder if that is political, I got to tell you. I don't know if the Obama administration decides there is some political advantage to doing it at this point. This has been sitting there for a very long time and obvious to everybody. But you are having now to go back against some of these officials that are long gone from Fannie and Freddie. There is no question they were misleading people and underestimating the subprime mortgages they had in hand and refusing to acknowledge it to investors.BAIER: David, Juan mentions the politics here. Obviously the issue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac came up in the debate last night and the exchange between Congresswoman Bachmann and Speaker Gingrich. Does this affect that environment, that equation?DAVID DRUCKER, REPORTER, ""ROLL CALL"": Potentially. Because we're two-and-a-half weeks from voting I think this could be problematic for the speaker because he has not yet figured out a way to talk about this in a way that makes Republican primary voters comfortable. They're very concerned about crony capitalism and the idea of government being involved in things they shouldn't be. It's becoming a bigger deal in Republican circles than it has been in the past. And so this does not help him to have this out there in the news. And it can prod his opponents to go after him about it.BAIER: I want to turn topics. We didn't do a Friday lightning round, but this will be sort of a Friday lightning round. The Keystone pipeline is in the payroll tax cut extension as it stands now. Today the House approved an omnibus spending bill, averting a government shutdown. The Senate still has to act. Fred, what about the Keystone pipeline back and forth and what Republicans have managed to do here?BARNES: They have managed to outwit Democrats, particularly President Obama. This is a terrible issue for President Obama. One, it show he is vacillating and weak and can't make a decision when he could have made the State Department first approved the pipeline a couple of year ago. It's also a jobs program. It will produce -- people dispute how many jobs, but nobody says it won't produce a lot of jobs. And the president is supposed to be for that. And then it's an energy thing, bringing all this oil from a secure, friendly neighbor, from Canada. To be against it or want to delay it is very bad for Obama. That's why he had to cave on this.BAIER: So Democrats not playing the hand well up there on Capitol Hill?WILLIAMS: They were outmaneuvered on this one because if the bill passed in the House with Keystone in it, the Senate is in a position where they have to approve it. Let me just say Fred just painted you a very sunny image of Keystone pipeline, because you even have the Republican governor of Nebraska who had objections. He's subsequently said yes he'd like to see the pipeline because he wants the jobs. Everybody wants the jobs.BARNES: They changed the course of the pipeline in Nebraska.WILLIAMS: They've changed the course, but they have to study it. Environmentalists have a legitimate point. Let's look and see what is going on. You can't just damage and force this thing. You know what, I think as part of the deal the Republicans are going to get their wish. The pipeline will go through. We'll see about the environmental damage. But from the president's perspective I don't think it was totally irresponsible for him to say let's look at it and make sure we're not damaging the environment.BAIER: He did come out and say don't put this together. Don't put these bills --WILLIAMS: Don't attach it.BAIER: They did.WILLIAMS: Now he is caving on that point.DRUCKER: Yes. The president has a habit of doing that and caving when it's totally unnecessary. If he would have signed off on this, the unions would have been happy, he would have had a job creating thing to tout. And the Republicans wouldn't have had this. Here it was hanging out there for him. It was extremely smart to go after it because you have a lot of Democrats who have been very publicly for it, the unions are for it. And there was no way Republicans weren't going to win on this politically, even if all this maneuvering on Capitol Hill over spending and the extenders fell apart.BAIER: When James Hoffa and John Boehner are on the same side of the one issue.(LAUGHTER)BARNES: If the president just approved this a couple of years ago when he could have, you wouldn't have had the environmentalists build up a huge protest against it.WILLIAMS: Maybe they have a point, Fred.BARNES: No, they don't. It's been studied to death.Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2011 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:Same Old Tune?Barack Obama may say he's for a new kind of politics but this is how his supporters plan to go after John McCain?New York Post Democratic commentator and FOX News contributor Kirsten Powers says Democrats will repeatedly accuse McCain of being too ""old"" and ""out of touch"" with the electorate. She says they will argue that McCain cannot be trusted on foreign policy and has confused Sunnis and Shiites in the past. And, they will point out that McCain suggested in May that U.S. forces have been drawn down to pre-surge levels -- which is not quite true.Another target will be McCain's reputation as a maverick. Powers says Democrats will argue McCain's Senate votes show that he is in lock-step with his Party and that he has abandoned any positions that may put him at odds with the GOP base.Powers says one line Democrats are already using is, ""The John McCain of 2000 wouldn't even vote for the John McCain of 2008.""Cutting Corners?Obama campaign staffers double-up at hotels, and the campaign does not pay for cabs from Chicago's O'Hare airport, but it is far from the most frugal campaign in history.In fact, the Weekly Standard's online blog reports Obama's team of 700 is the biggest in presidential election history -- more than twice as large as president Bush's in 2004 -- and seven times as big as John McCain's organization.The Center for Responsive Politics reports that data for February, March and April of this year show Obama has outspent McCain's campaign two-to-one on office rent, four-and-a-half to one on staff salaries and 25-to-one on broadcast advertising.Where's the Love?It was supposed to be a post-primary unity event at the Democratic National Committee headquarters Wednesday. But the love, at times, was hard to find.While elected Democrats filed into the Party's conference room for the show of solidarity, DNC Chairman Howard Dean -- not realizing his microphone was switched on -- took a shot at the famously voluble New York senator Charles Schumer.As Dean was trying to begin the meeting, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that he should wait until Schumer stopped talking.Dean replied, ""That'll be a long wait.""Old FaithfulAnd finally, for 50 years a playground slide at the Birmingham, England, botanical gardens has been a great joy to children. The Daily Mail reports that there have never been any serious mishaps -- or even complaints -- about the slide.But a group of health and safety administrators has determined that the possibility of an accident is enough to scrap the slide altogether. They say the slide does not meet standards introduced in 1999 to regulate playground equipment -- but admit the rules do not cover existing structures.Conservative council member James Hutchings told the Daily Mail, ""It's completely mad the way we are being run ragged by the health and safety mafia. If there hadn't been an accident in 50 years then the chances are there's not much wrong with this slide.""Unhappy parent Rachael McKelvey added that the old slide ""at least... had some character.""-- FOX News Channel's Zachary Kenworthy contributed to this report."

It was wrong for me to ever deny she was my daughter.""Edwards says he has been providing financial support for the child and will continue to do so. There is an ongoing federal investigation into whether he used campaign money to cover up the affair.CBS News reports Edwards informed the White House of his desire to go to Haiti to help with earthquake relief. But that his declaration was met with silence. Despite that, he did travel to Haiti today.Blame It on Washington Outspoken Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is accusing the United States of playing God in Haiti. Spanish newspaper ABC reports Chavez is blaming the U.S. Navy for the earthquake. Chavez believes it occurred during the testing of a new weapon off Haiti's coast. He says the ultimate goal is ""to destroy Iran with a series of earthquakes designed to overthrow the Islamic regime.""Just Do It And finally, South Korea is trying to boost its low birthrate by encouraging some government workers to clock out early and head straight for the bedroom.French Press Agency reports Choi Jin-Sun of the South Korean Health Ministry saying the health ministry plans on turning off the lights in its offices at 7:30 p.m. every third Wednesday to, ""help staff get dedicated to childbirth and upbringing.""Choi Jin-Sun admits going home early may have no direct link to having more kids, but says it certainly couldn't hurt. The ministry also offers cash incentives for staff who produce more than two babies.-- Fox News Channel's Lanna Britt contributed to this report."	[]	['god']
3	3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/04/19/politics-ground-zero-mosque-general-petraeus-media-blitz/	Politics of Ground Zero Mosque; General Petraeus' Media Blitz	" This is a rush transcript of ""Special Report With Bret Baier"" from August 16, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : As a citizen and as president, I believe that Muslims have the right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country.(APPLAUSE)That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan in accordance with local laws and ordinances. This is America and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakable.I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom of making a decision to put a mosque there. I was commenting very specifically on the right that people have that dates back to our founding. That's what our country's about.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: The president making remarks Friday at the White House and then clarifying those remarks Saturday in Florida. Now there is a lot of firestorm politically from Republicans and now Democrats as well. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid through a spokesman says this, quote, ""The First Amendment protects freedom of religion. Senator Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built someplace else.""What about the fallout from all of this? Let's bring in our panel tonight: Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard; Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. You think I could say the name correctly after all these years.Charles, let's start with you. What about the dustup after this weekend, what the fallout is?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, when you consider the sequence of events, it begins with the White House saying this is a local issue; we are not going to comment. Then you get the president ostentatiously endorsing what appears to be the mosque at a Ramadan dinner to a Muslim audience, which is not a great act of courage -- that audience likes hearing it.Then it turns out a day later 1,000 miles away he says on camera as we heard, but I was only addressing the legality of it. That's not addressing anything. We all agree on legality. It's the propriety, the decency of this on which he doesn't comment, but it does imply he might have a few questions about the propriety of it.And then you get the White House saying it was not a walk-back. It was walk-back. It was a revocation. You get whiplash out of all of this. What happened was the president made a strong statement, hailed as a courageous one at the dinner at Ramadan. But it wasn't a matter of courage. Courage would have been that audience, a Muslim audience, he should have said, yes, I believe in the legal right -- you have every legal right to do it -- but I would appeal to you as Americans -- after all, I'm the president, not a judge, not the Supreme Court, I don't decide on legality, but as president, I speak on behalf of the spirit of America -- that you ought to consider decency and propriety of establishing house of worship dedicated to Islam at a spot where people were murdered in the name of Islam.Obviously there is a distinction between murderers and religion. There is a no question about that. But this is place where you might want a non-denominational place of worship, as you have in hospitals, a place of meditation. But establishing a mosque in that area is a provocation. The president should have said that, he didn't. He missed an opportunity. And I think he alienated all sides here.BAIER: Nia, some Democrats are scratching their heads. And now you have the Senate majority leader putting out a statement. Other candidates are putting out statements. How troublesome is this as an issue politically?NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, WASHINGTON POST: It's troublesome for now. I think it's yet to be determined whether or not this is going to last until November. You know, obviously economies is what people are focused on.I think for now, I mean, some of the points that Charles articulated, this idea it's about the First Amendment on the one hand but also maybe this should be placed somewhere else. This looks like a place that Democrats can essentially stake out. We saw Reid do that. So, in some ways I don't necessarily know that it's clear it's only a problem for Democrats, because on the stump they can essentially articulate whatever position they want. There isn't going to be any record of voting for this. They are not going to have to vote for this in Congress or anything.So I think they will have enough room to articulate things in the way that they want to.BAIER: The issue when you poll it, Bill, the latest Fox News Opinion Dynamics poll has it this way -- ""Do Muslims have a right to build a mosque near Ground Zero?"" Yes, they have the right, 61 percent. Now the question of building the mosque, an Islamic culture center near ground zero, is it appropriate -- 30 percent; is it wrong, 64 percent.The polls seem to be able to differentiate between the right and whether it is right.BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: As does Harry Reid. I agree with Harry Reid. I've wanted to say that for three and a half years. For three and a half years he's been Senate majority leader and I don't think I've ever said that on this set or maybe anywhere else. But I'm bipartisan kind of guy.(LAUGHTER)The Reid-Kristol position, if I call it that, is that of course there are legal rights to use private party in accordance with the local laws, but the mosque should be built somewhere else.What do they say about property, location, location, location? This is about the location. Governor Paterson, the Democratic governor of New York, about a week ago offered the builders and the imam -- Imam Rauf -- we will help you find another place that's half a mile away where you won't face the questions about your intention and you won't offend a lot of people and he was turned down, it appears.So this is not finding a place for worship for Muslims in lower Manhattan. This is making a statement, and I think a provocative and offensive statement to many Americans right at Ground Zero. And that's what I think Harry Reid's comments bring out very well and that is something that President Obama I think will have to express an opinion about at some point.BAIER: Charles, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke out today saying this -- ""If we shout down a mosque and a community center because it's two blocks away from the site where freedom is attacked, I think it would be a sad day for America.""Now, we just pulled up The New York Times from December 8, 2009, where it describes the Burlington Coat Factory and the staff in there saying ""there was no immediate sign that the fiery cataclysm, but out of the blue suddenly stained with smoke, a plane's landing gear assembly, the size of a World War II torpedo, crashed through the roof and down through two empty selling floors of the Burlington Coat Factory."" That's from The New York Times in 2009. That is the building.KRAUTHAMMER: That is the building. And it hasn't been mentioned at all. In fact, if this hadn't happened it would still be a sacrilege, I believe, to be on the edge of the vicinity of Ground Zero.But this in fact, the fact that you cite, means that the site was a point of attack. This was Mohammad Atta's plane which he was using as missile to indiscriminately attack Americans and destroy and kill as much as he could. And a piece of that missile, that airplane, went through the roof on that site. That is a point of attack of 9/11. It's not even peripheral area. And that makes it all the more a provocation.BAIER: Last thing -- Nia, if Democrats had a problem with positioning today, they had another person speak out today, and that is the cofounder of Hamas. Take a listen quickly:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AL-ZAHAR, HAMAS CO-FOUNDER: We have to build everywhere. In every area we have to pray and this mosque is the only site of prayer especially for the people when they are looking to be in a group, not an individual.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So what is your sense? Does this thing blow over? Is this August, that we are covering this too much? Or is this a real big issue?HENDERSON: My sense, I think it's popular to say everything ends up being a political issue, but my sense is it will blow over by November and it won't necessarily be an issue. The Democrats, point of fact, might have a way to do something that a lot of them wanted to do and that is distance themselves from Obama on some issue.BAIER: Last word, Bill?KRISTOL: The only way this blows over is if they move the mosque.BAIER: What do you think is the most important factor in the mosque controversy? Logon to our homepage at FOXnews.com/specialreport. Vote in the online poll, right there on the right of the screen.Up next, General David Petraeus goes on a media blitz and his boss goes on the clock.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS, US/NATO AFGHANISTAN TROOPS COMMANDER: We have to really put our shoulder to the wheel and show during the course of this year that progress can be achieved. And again, one manifestation of that out there is that you have this date. But again, we have had good dialogue on this and I think the president has been clear in explaining that it's a process, not an event and that it's conditions-based.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: General David Petraeus in Afghanistan on a bit of a media blitz this weekend, talking to The Washington Post, New York Times and ""Meet the Press.""Also we learned today from a Foreign Policy magazine interview, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said this about his job, quote, ""I think that by next year I'll be in a position where you know we're going to know whether the strategy is working in Afghanistan. We'll have completed the surge. We will have done the assessment in January and it seems like somewhere in 2011 is a logical opportunity to hand off."" He's saying he may be done sometime in 2011. Not a surprise, perhaps.What about all of this? We're back with the panel. Nia, first to General Petraeus being the face now and essentially saying July, 2011, is really conditions-based. And he's going to make the recommendations he is going to make to President Obama.HENDERSON: You heard the White House saying today that there is no daylight between their feelings about this drawdown date and General Petraeus.He definitely has -- I don't think it's probably accurate to say this is his war. He definitely has been the face of this war. It is one place I think the administration has been consistent with the messaging. You saw Petraeus. He's on his media blitz. Obviously, on the one hand, striking, you know, a command of the military. But also speaking politically and kind of being the political face of this war and trying to suggest that this is going to be hard -- this war, this drawdown, the pullout -- the conditions on the ground are improving somewhat, but obviously speaking to some Democrats and the public, who are kind of sour, quite frankly, on this war.BAIER: He doesn't answer a question better than most. He does not wade too much, Bill, in the politics of things.What about this push to get Petraeus out there talking about it?KRISTOL: He does a lot of things better than most.I think the irony of the fact that Bob Gates, secretary of Defense, and David Petraeus, commander in Iraq, probably more than any other two people pulled off the surge in the last two years of the Bush administration over bitter opposition of the Democratic Party in the House and Senate, including then-Senator Obama and then-Senator Biden and then-Senator Clinton. That those two are now central to the Obama administration success in the most important, probably one of the two most important foreign policy fronts they're facing, but they have to win the war in Afghanistan for many reasons, I think. It's one of those little ironies of history.I would say that I think Bob Gates genuinely intended to leave at the end of 2008. If you look at interviews he gave in mid-2008, he said over and over, I want to go home, I want to go home. President-elect Obama asked him to stay. He stayed.I think now he intends to leave probably mid to late 2011, after the July 2011 date, I think when he thinks things are on a decent path. But I honestly believe if President Obama says why don't you stay for the whole first term that Bob Gates will feel that that's the right thing to do.So I wouldn't be surprised to see Gates and Obama -- Gates and Petraeus as the two key executors of Obama's Afghanistan policy for the next two years.BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: I would agree. I mean, this is really -- ironies abound. Here we are three years ago, Petraeus arrives in Washington with an ad calling him ""General Betray-us."" And Senator Clinton at the time, said listening to him requires suspension of disbelief, which is a rather sharp questioning of the man's integrity.Here we are three years later, he's the face of the war, which I think is more than ironic. I think there is something odd about this. The president is the one who made a decision. He comes in office and he has two wars on his hands. He decides Iraq, he wants to wash his hands of and he's out. All he's done has gotten us out.Afghanistan is a war he embraces. He decides this is a war that is important -- a just war he wants to win it or succeed in it in some way. He triples our forces there. He gives one speech in December, 2009. Generally speaking he stays away. He talks about the economy, autos, he talks about green energy, he talks about batteries. He doesn't speak about a war which is essentially his war. Not in the Michael Steele way that he invented it. But he embraced it. He said this is important, I commit America to it as we're leaving Iraq.And who speaks on his behalf? Petraeus, a general. I mean, that's OK, but that is not the way it ought to be done. If the president wants to give a sense of seriousness of commitment and for Afghans to make a decision who they will support, to believe, he has to show he is committed. Otherwise, you get a sense of he's half-hearted in all of this.BAIER: Quickly, Nia, Defense Secretary Gates, he does have a big role in this administration.HENDERSON: Yes. He does have a big role in this administration. And as I was reading the Foreign Policy piece when it said he was going to leave in 2008 and now essentially that he's going to leave in 2011, I kind of thought to myself, I wonder if he even leaves in 2011 if the president comes and says, hey, we still need you as secretary of defense, if he, you know, essentially decides to stay.BAIER: Panel, thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network, LLC.

4	4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/04/19/politics-stimulus-economy-and-ground-zero-mosque/	Politics of Stimulus, Economy and the Ground Zero Mosque	"This is a rush transcript of ""Special Report With Bret Baier"" from August 18, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The economy is getting stronger, but it really suffered a big trauma. And we're not going to get all eight million jobs lost back overnight.But what we're trying to do is create sort of a virtuous cycle where people start feeling better and better about the economy. And a lot of this is sort of like recovering from an illness. You get a little stronger each day.MARK MELLMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: The problem is people don't feel better. They look around, they don't see an improvement in their own lives. They don't see improvement in the lives of their friends and relatives, and that leads them to think the economy is still in bad shape. That sets an important context for these elections in 2010.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: The president of Ohio today and a Democratic strategist there talking about the economy. The president traveled for the ninth time since taking office to Ohio. The vice president heads back for his eighth visit to Ohio next week.Let's take a look at the latest polls. The presidential approval number in Gallup today stands at 41 percent. Then the president's handling of the economy, approval 41 percent, disapproval, 56 percent -- this is a record in this poll. And is the economy in better shape than it was 18 months ago? Better, 38 percent, then you see worse or about the same, 29 and 32 percent.What about all of this, the politics heading to the midterms? Let's bring in our panel, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard; Julie Mason, White House correspondent for Washington Examiner, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Bill, thoughts?BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I guess 17 visits by President Obama and Vice President Biden to Ohio. I read that Ohio lost about 160,000 jobs during the Obama-Biden administration. They are losing 10,000 jobs a visit. Maybe they should ask the president and vice president to stay away and the job loss might halt.The economy is hurting President Obama badly. He went to Ohio with the Democratic governor, Ted Strickland, and there's a big gubernatorial race to succeed him. If you listen to Mitch Daniels, the Republican governor of Indiana, speak, one of his big talking points is Indiana is doing better than its neighboring state Ohio. Incidentally, West Virginia which has a Democratic governor is doing better than Ohio. Ohio's unemployment rate is two percent higher than West Virginia's, which is pretty startling.Anyway, contrast his policies in Indiana with the Democratic policies of Ohio which have been like President Obama policies, which Daniels says, at the national level.I think Ohio will be interesting. If Republicans win the governorship and the senatorship in Ohio, that's a real, as you say, President Obama and Vice President Biden going there so much, it becomes a real referendum because it has a Democratic governor in addition, a real referendum on Democratic economic policies.BAIER: Julie, other candidates -- Democratic candidates -- are having a hard time with the economy and the message perhaps. Richard Blumenthal in Connecticut, candidate there, a Democrat, said this about the stimulus, quote, ""I believe that the stimulus was wrongly structured because it failed to provide jobs and paychecks to ordinary Americans. It unfortunately was inadequately designed to invest in infrastructure and roads and bridges and schools.""He said he would vote against it as it was structured. That's an interesting talking point from a Democrat.JULIE MASON, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: It is. And it's certainly a theme that emerging in this campaign. You don't see the Democrats running very hard on the stimulus.And even today, what struck me about today's event, Bret, watching the president, how much new stagecraft the White House is doing. We saw in the AP poll, he got a 41 percent approval rating for the economy, but his overall approval rating was 49 percent. And the gap -- the difference is people still like him personally. So we see him in his shirt sleeves in a kitchen and then out in a yard, and it was very deliberate by the White House. There was a picnic table and a tree-house. And you see the president really playing up his likability factor more than the specific message of the economy.I think we will see more of that from the White House.BAIER: Charles, but the White House is defending the stimulus saying it created or saved 2.5 or 3.6 million jobs is the line we've heard from Vice President Biden many times.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, that's not going to help and the tree-house is not going to help and the short sleeves aren't going to help.Look, he bought the economy when he did the stimulus. He was a month into the presidency. This is a $1 trillion bet he had the American people buy on to. And it failed, at least the overwhelming perception is.Democrats think it's all politically toxic. They are not the ones who bring it up. It's Republicans who bring it up. And when you bet $1 trillion dollars and you know you added $1 trillion to the debt and no results, in fact, negative results, you own the economy.And so he does, you know, the routine where he says the Bush drove us in a ditch, you want to give him the keys? That's kind of worn -- it's not going to work. Eighteen months in, you own it, and if you had a policy at the beginning, like Reagan with the tax cuts, he bought it as well. And they were hurt badly, the Republicans in the midterm election in '82, as a result of a weak economy because he owned that economy.I think what is really interesting is that there's an axiom in politics that by mid-summer people's perceptions of the economy is fixed and that carries into the Election Day. Even if the numbers between now and then change a bit, it's not going to alter perceptions.We heard earlier there is a poll, only 12 percent of Americans think the economy improving. It was twice as high a year ago. And that's perfect reflection of the real economy. A year ago, the growth in GDP was twice what it was in the quarter that has just passed. That's the impression that is settling in and it's unchangeable between now and November. And that's why Democrats are going to lose.BAIER: Bill, it was interesting to hear Mark Mellman, the Democratic strategist, talk as openly as he did about Democratic issues on the economy.KRISTOL: I know Mark. I was wondering, you know, when his phone was ringing, Rahm Emanuel on line one. ""Mark, you're not supposed to say that.""Look, it is a big problem. The perceptions are bad. And to pick up on what Charles was saying, economy rallied pretty strongly in the fourth quarter of 2009 -- I think it was plus 5.7 percent. It was down to about plus 3.4 percent in the first quarter; I think 2.7 or something in second quarter. And it's going to be, I'm told, revised down --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Under two.KRISTOL: Maybe one, 1.5 as the new data coming in. That is a big problem.I mean, they did the stimulus, they got the bounce. But to have it peter out this quickly is terrible politically.With Reagan, we went through tough times the country did in 1982. Reagan said stay the course. But he can say plausibly, the tax cut's coming on January 1, 1983. We're going through these tough times, but better times are ahead. And luckily for Reagan, better times were ahead.But the trouble that Democrats have, what is their narrative? What is going to get it going in 2011? A tax hike? I don't think so. More regulations? Where is their growth package?BAIER: Log on to the home page at foxnews.com/specialreport to get ready for tonight's online show starting at 7 ET.Up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi goes after critics of the planned mosque near Ground Zero.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: I look to my colleagues in New York, some of them have different views on the subject. It's up to them to work it out. But there is no question that there is a concerted effort to make this a political issue by some and I join the -- those who have called for looking into how is this opposition to the mosque being funded?REP. PETE KING, R-N.Y.: For Nancy Pelosi to suggest there's going to be an investigation of these people is absolutely outrageous, it's disgraceful and, to me, the speaker was really out of line on this.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi weighing in for the first time on the mosque controversy. She later thought to clarify her first public comments, saying that she thinks the funding for actual mosque project should be looked in to as well.Now we have the president weighing in, saying he has no regrets about his statements after being asked in Ohio. And this just in, this afternoon, former Vermont governor and former presidential candidate Howard Dean weighed in as well, telling WABC radio, ""This is something we ought to be able to work out with people in good faith. I think another -- I think another site would be a better idea. I would look to do that with the cooperation of people who are trying to build the mosque,"" saying another site may be better.So what about all of this and the politics, the policy? We're back with the panel.Julie, let's start with you.MASON: Well Bret, you hear all this lamenting about this, turning this in to a political issue. It's too late -- it's a political issue. Someone needs to step up. We heard Obama kind of parsing middle distance on this over the weekend and today saying no regrets but not really going any further than that.This is a terrible issue for the Democrats. Someone needs to step up and clarify where the party stands on this.And meanwhile, Republicans are fighting with each other, too. Pat Buchanan said that Newt Gingrich went too far on the issue. So now we have gone in a parallel universe.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: Bill?KRISTOL: I'm still getting my head around that parallel universe.Howard Dean also says building the mosque where it is going to be built with the intention behind is it a real affront to the people who lost their lives on 9/11. I am happy to agree with Howard Dean.BAIER: You agreed with Senator Reid and Howard Dean.MASON: I feel like I don't know you.KRISTOL: I'm a bipartisan kind of guy.(CROSSTALK)KRAUTHAMMER: Well, are you a liberal or are they neo-cons?(LAUGHTER)KRISTOL: I like the idea of Howard Dean becoming a neo-con. He really dislikes Obama, the truth is, and he's happy, I think, to take a little bit of a shot at the Obama administration and lay the groundwork for his primary challenge to President Obama a year from now.BAIER: Now Bill --KRISTOL: You heard it here. Don't you think Dean would love to primary Obama?In any case, he'll be anti-Afghanistan, anti-the war and anti-the mosque, so it will be the best of all worlds in the Democratic primary.Look, when Obama said no regrets today, it was a funny thing to say. It almost sounded -- it's the kind of thing you say when you lost. You know? It's finished. It's over, but no regrets. ""Je ne regrette rien"" -- that great Edith Piaf song. I won't sing it here for you --BAIER: Thank you.KRISTOL: Disappointing to the viewers. Wonderful song, though.And I do think deep down the Democrats know this is over and I would suspect they're going to put some private pressure now on the imam and on the developer to pull the plug on this over the next week or so, I should think.BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: Well, I spent the afternoon wrapping my mind around Pelosi's remark about looking into the finances of those who oppose the motion. I want to join with others. I'd like to know who the others are. Are any of them non-institutionalized?And then I'm trying to decide if the statement was out of malice or sheer lunacy. And being the generous soul I am, I go with lunacy. I mean, after all, the implication that Debra Burlingame, the sister of one of the pilots who died on 9/11, would have to be secretly paid to express her anguish over the establishment of a monument to Islam in a place where 3,000 were massacred in the name of Islam is obscene.Look, looking into the financing of the mosque is logical. We know there is a history in this country of fake charities which are funneling money to terrorist organizations. They've been investigated. We've had -- this is a real issue. It's not a hypothetical, it's not a can-be.But the idea that those who oppose the mosque are some kind of conspiracy or funding ought to be looked at is absurd. Look, I oppose the mosque. No one has offered me a penny. What am I, chopped liver? I need a new roof.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: Julie, you mentioned Republicans split on this. Is it, do you think, a powerful political issue heading 70-plus days in the midterms?MASON: Well, it almost is, but I think we're to the point people are overplaying their hands on the issue. It's just gone just a little too far. So it could have been, but now it's kind of gone a little crazy. And the Democrats don't know what to do. The Republicans are kind of screwing it up. So it's hard to see who gets the benefit.BAIER: And last thing, prospects of actually moving this site, David Paterson, the governor of New York, others saying they are negotiating or trying to.Bill?KRISTOL: I think the developer who has real money at stake will decide at some point he doesn't need all this. And it's nice that Imam Rauf has made a big splash here with his provocative decision to try to build a mosque right near Ground Zero, but I think he will pull the plug on it."

His state's AFL-CIO president called Manchin's absence -- quote -- ""ineffective representation and leadership.""Manchin said his family celebrated the holiday early because of his grandchildren who wouldn't be there on the actual holiday. But he says if the same situation were to happen in the future, he'll be in Washington.Manchin isn't the only lawmaker missing holiday votes. More than 70 House members didn't bother showing up to vote Tuesday on bills to fund the federal government and ensure health benefits for 9/11 first responders.

It used to be nine times... OK, maybe it's legal and maybe it passes muster with shareholders. But there's something about us that fundamentally feels it isn't right.(END AUDIO CLIP)Affleck knows a little something about high salaries. He earns tens of millions of dollars for his movies and even reportedly got $250,000 just for showing up at the grand opening of a casino over the summer."	['Manchin']	[]
