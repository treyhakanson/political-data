This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" October 12, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, two big stories breaking this evening in the presidential race. First, at least three new women come forward to publicly accuse Donald Trump of groping them against their will. Growing calls tonight as well for accountability from the Clinton campaign as more damaging emails are leaked by WikiLeaks, raising more accusations of antireligious bigotry and anti-Hispanic comments now, too, within Hillary Clinton's inner circle.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. Just another night in 2016. We'll get to the latest on Trump and women shortly, but first to the Clinton controversy. As we first reported last night, the emails obtained by WikiLeaks were sent several years ago. Among those included on the exchanges, Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta and Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri. In these messages, people of faith are insulted, and there are even suggestions that the Catholic Church doctrine needs to be overthrown by the Clinton team, which apparently better knows what's good for us.The Clinton campaign argues, there's nothing to be seen here, there's no bigotry, and they blame the whole ordeal on the Russians for exposing the emails in the first place. But the Trump campaign was quick to pounce on the story.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The new emails also show members of the Clinton team viciously attacking Catholics and evangelicals. They attack Catholics and evangelicals, viciously. And that won't be tolerated, but it won't be tolerated by the voters.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In moments, we'll speak with Bill Bennett, a Catholic and a Trump supporter, about the political fallout, along with Democrat Julie Roginsky.But we begin with Trace Gallagher with the late-breaking developments live from our West Coast Newsroom. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, the newest batch of leaked emails is from 2012, a time when the U.S. conference of Catholic bishops was strongly opposing a mandate in ObamaCare that called for federal funding of contraceptives. In an email to now Clinton Campaign Chief John Podesta, Sandy Newman, the president of the liberal group Voices for Progress, writes, quoting, ""There needs to be a Catholic spring in which Catholics themselves demand the end of the middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church.""Newman, who's Jewish, goes on to admit that he's not qualified to be involved and doesn't know how to, quote, ""Plant the seeds of the revolution."" But John Podesta responds by apparently assuring Newman that the revolution is under way and that he is helping to push the progressive agenda on the Catholic Church -- quoting again, ""We created Catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this, but I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise, Catholics united, like most spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up.""When the first bunch of Catholic-bashing emails was leaked, criticizing our boss, Rupert Murdoch, for raising his kids Catholic and calling conservative involvement in the Catholic church, quote, ""An amazing bastardization of the faith."" We noted that Podesta, who's Catholic, did not respond, but the current Clinton campaign communications Director Jen Palmieri apparently did, writing, quote, ""I imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable, politically conservative religion. Their rich friends wouldn't understand if they became evangelicals."" Palmieri says, she doesn't recognize the email, but then she was pressed on whether she actually wrote it. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENNIFER PALMIERI, CLINTON COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: I said I didn't recognize it, but moreover, we're just not -- these are -- we are not, we are not checking. We are not going to fact-check each of the emails that were stolen.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: A little struggle there. The conservative group Catholic Vote, which claims 500,000 members, is calling on Palmieri to resign. Quote, ""Catholics will be watching Hillary Clinton to see whether she thinks our religious faith should be respected or whether it's fair game to mock us.""  The former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, Jim Nicholson, says no religion should suffer this kind of denigration, and neither should the Catholics.  The Clinton campaign accuses Trump of colluding with Russia on these leaks.  Former Trump adviser Roger Stone reportedly says, he has back-channel communications with WikiLeaks but does not coordinate with them -- Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you. Joining me now, Bill Bennett. He served as secretary of education under President Reagan. He's the chairman of conservative leaders for education. Bill, good to see you.BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY: Thank you.  KELLY: So, Jennifer Palmieri, I mean, this is her on the inner circle with Hillary Clinton now. And her statement today on whether she was caught red-handed bashing Catholics -- let's just play it again and let the audience make up their minds about whether this is a truth-teller in this moment.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PALMIERI: I said I didn't recognize it, but moreover, we're just not, we're not doing -- we're not -- these are all -- these are -- we are not -- we are not checking -- we are not going to fact-check each of the emails that was, that were stolen.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: You tell me, Bill. Your thoughts.BENNETT: What did she say, the Russians did it, the Catholics did it, the Pope did it? Look, this is -- this crowd has been anti-Catholic for a long time. This has left us any Catholicism. These are transatlantic agnostic progressives. They do not believe in things like the authority of the Catholic Church. Now, as the conservative, I worry that the age of Clinton has been with us too long and may last even longer. But I've got to tell you, I think the Catholic Church will outlast the Clintons, and I think it will be around when they are long gone. This notion of uprooting thousands of years of Catholic doctrine --KELLY: Revolution.  BENNETT: We know what this is about. Well, it's Catholic teaching on marriage, on same-sex, on contraception, and most of all, on abortion.  They just can't stand that. Catholics, I hope, will take note of this.  Their faith is being attacked. Their faith is being disparaged, and they should react to it.  KELLY: Can you imagine if this kind of talk were, you know, heard inside the Trump campaign about Islam?BENNETT: Well, I can't imagine, but if it were, heads would roll. You know, they'd cut heads off, I imagine, in the proper fashion. But no, I mean, it would be crazy. Look, Michael Novak, a distinguished man, thinker and Catholic, said there's one acceptable form of bigotry left in society in America and that's anti-Christianity, and Catholicism in its original form is much hated. They would like to do away with it and its teaching.  But others have tried, stronger parties have tried and haven't prevailed against Rome.  KELLY: Is she going to be able to get away with ""I don't recognize that""?  That's a non-denial denial.BENNETT: Yes.KELLY: I don't recognize it. Let me tell you, we put an email on the screen on Friday that was -- we got fooled. It was a bogus one about Hillary allegedly calling some Bernie supporters ""buckets of losers,"" which we corrected immediately before the show ended.  BENNETT: Yes.  KELLY: They were very quick to tell us when we had it wrong. They didn't call up and say we don't recognize that one. They said it was a fake! And it was our bad. We made a mistake. I don't recognize that as not a denial. And you tell me whether given the amount of people involved in this exchange, including the campaign chair, they need to come out and apologize. Is it so hard?BENNETT: Absolutely.  KELLY: I mean, say what you will about Trump and the women -- and he needed to apologize -- but at least he made an effort.  BENNETT: Sure. He did. No, he did. He apologized, but they won't.  Look, they'll stall. They're looking at numbers. They like the way the numbers look, just stalled, you know, rope-a-dope, run out the clock, you know, down the ball, throw it out of bounds. They won't admit to any of this. But the more that comes out, the more we see the heart and soul of this party. This is identity politics and this is the underbelly of identity politics. People who don't agree with us are backward, they need to be educated, we need a revolution. And boy, that may be coming with the reign of Hillary Clinton, should that, God forbid, occur.  KELLY: Well, I've got to ask you about that before I let you go, Bill, because you've been a very strong supporter of Donald Trump. You've been an honest guy, you've supported him but you've admitted when he's misstepped. And this weekend in the wake of that ""Access Hollywood"" tape, you tweeted out or you said publicly, ""It's a shame, a crying shame, but he can't win. He should step down. I hate to say it, but it's over."" Do you still believe that?BENNETT: Well, it's not over, he's not stepping down. I feared it might be because of the play the media was giving it. I do think he responded to it well and he had a good debate on Sunday night. Mine was an empirical judgment based on the facts, based on what I thought the media would do with it, and they have done that with it. And of course, sex overcomes venality, it overcomes any religious, anti-Catholic bigotry, but I think the way that situation developed in the debate helped Donald Trump a lot.I thought at the moment that Mike Pence as the head of the ticket might prevail, might do better, but that's impossible now. Those ballots are out there. Stick with Trump. It's still possible. It's hard because of the way the thing has been played and because of Trump's mistakes, frankly, many of them. But when you listen to what the Clintons are up to and what this campaign is up to and how intolerant and bigoted these people are, we can see what the stakes are -- Megyn.  KELLY: Okay. And I've got to squeeze this in before I let you go. Back in the '90s when Bill Clinton was being accused by all these women, your brother, Bob Bennett, a famous lawyer, was Mr. Clinton's defense lawyer.  You were out there criticizing Bill Clinton and your brother was out there defending him. It was an interesting dynamic. But what do you make now of Trump's attempt to resurrect the claims of Paula Jones and Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Willy?BENNETT: I don't know how much impact it has. You've got to remember, audiotape has a palpability to it. People hear it. They hear it over and over again. If you had audiotape or videotape of Bill Clinton with Juanita Broderick or with Monica Lewinsky or with Kathleen Willy, he wouldn't be standing up in public today. That's the age in which we live. That's the information age. I think you would agree with that, but I'm not sure how much impact that has. People don't know what he's talking about when he talks about Bill Clinton. To many young people, this might as well have been the middle ages.  KELLY: I feel old. I don't know about you, Bill. Good to see you. Go.BENNETT: Good to see you, Megyn. Always good to see you. Thank you.  KELLY: All right. I love that. Also with us tonight, Julie Roginsky, a Fox News contributor and Democratic analyst. Julie, good to see you.JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you, Megyn.KELLY: You know, you were on the show railing about that Star of David.  It looked like the Star of David.ROGINSKY: Yes.KELLY: Trump said it was a sheriff's star in one of his tweets that he re- tweeted, calling her crooked Hillary. Do you see this as anti-Catholic bigotry by the Hillary camp?ROGINSKY: Well, I see it as Catholics discussing what they consider to be a reformation in their church. And by the way, Pew just came out with a poll a few weeks ago saying exactly the same thing, that the attitudes of American Catholics, this is not a value judgment by me. I'm not Catholic.  I certainly have no right to judge anybody in that sense, but what the majority of Catholics in this country feel seems to be very similar to what they're talking about and seems to be very dissimilar from what the Vatican is saying.I'll give you an example. Eighty nine percent of American Catholics think that contraception is morally acceptable. Sixty five percent think employers shouldn't opt out of the law based on religious objection. You have 64 percent thinking homosexual behavior is not morally wrong. So, if you look at those statistics, you look at the fact that the majority of American Catholics seem to agree with what Jen Palmieri and John Podesta seem to be saying about their emails --KELLY: You're being very charitable in your description on the emails, which are very pejorative in their tone. Very.ROGINSKY: But they're pejorative. Yes. I agree they're pejorative in their tone. I also agree that they're pejorative in their tone towards the hierarchy of the Catholic Church.  KELLY: Also towards a couple of Latinos. Maybe you saw those where they refer --ROGINSKY: I didn't.  KELLY: In August of 2015, Podesta, the campaign chair, urged Mrs. Clinton to reach out to Latinos. The email's subject was ""Needy Latinos and one easy call,"" and he went on to list Federico Pena, Bill Clinton's secretary of Transportation, and former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson as the two ""needy Latinos,"" she should woo.  ROGINSKY: Well, I don't know what sense he meant it. Are they Latinos that necessarily wanted to reach out to her --KELLY: Just this characterization of it, you know, the dismissiveness.  You know if you saw that in a Trump camp email, you'd be going nuts on them!ROGINSKY: I actually, Megyn, I have to say this. On Latinos, I agree with you. On the Catholic thing, it's a little different, and the reason I took such offense of the Star of David tweet thing is because that's my faith.  That's what I believe and that's what I know.  KELLY: But if you defend one religious belief and the attack on it, then you should be charitable toward all of them.  ROGINSKY: I am charitable, as I said, towards the fact that this seems to me from polling -- and again, not my personal view, but it seems to me from polling the vast majority of American Catholics seem to agree with their view on where Catholicism should be.  KELLY: But I'm Catholic. I've lived as a Catholic my whole life, but I haven't heard my fellow Catholics speak so snidely about our faith, other than in this email.  ROGINSKY: But are they snidely --KELLY: They talk about it in a way that's hopeful, that's maybe somewhat regretful, but not with disdain about our church and our beliefs.  ROGINSKY: I don't know that that was seen as disdain, whether it was --KELLY: They were mocking Rupert Murdoch for having the nerve to baptize his children Catholic.  ROGINSKY: That's different. They were mocking Rupert Murdoch, and that's, you and I would both agree, that's not acceptable, but they're not mocking, I believe, is the Catholic Church where it is in America today. What they're saying is where the Catholic Church, and specifically, the majority of Catholics --KELLY: You can't mock a man's decision to baptize his children --ROGINSKY: I'm not disagreeing with you on that.KELLY: -- and say it's not mocking Catholicism or the church.  (CROSSTALK)ROGINSKY: Different. Different. I disagree with you on that. I think they mock. There's no excuse to mock a man for practicing his faith the way he wants to practice it. Let's take Rupert Murdoch out of this equation. I think it's wrong to mock people who believe contraception is morally wrong. I think it's wrong, and I'm pro-choice to mock people for their pro-life beliefs. What I don't think -- what I do think there's a big difference here is that what they're saying is potentially, and actually actively in step with what the majority of American Catholics believe.KELLY: You already made that point. We already discussed that, now you're repeating yourself --ROGINSKY: The tone --KELLY: But the point is that these people who want Trump out there apologizing for everything he did, and he's taken a lot of criticism for not doing that. God forbid, they said -- they don't even have to send Hillary out there. Once you send your director of communications out there, just own what she said and apologize to the millions of American Catholic voters who you're trying to solicit votes from in this election.  I'm stealing the last word. I've got to go.ROGINSKY: See you later.  KELLY: Love you, mean it.  ROGINSKY: Bye.  KELLY: Well, as you heard at the top of the hour, not only does team Clinton think that they know who is behind the attacks, they think Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin are working hand and hand with the Trump campaign.And there's a developing story on that accusation tonight. Carl Higbie and Nomiki Konst are next on the cold war claims emerging in 2016.Plus, we'll have the breaking news on a series of ugly, new allegations about Trump and women coming out this evening. See what the Trump campaign was on edge about all day today and what they're saying tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless, other girls were naked.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: More now on our top story tonight as the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party try to deal with a flood of embarrassing email leaks by refusing to discuss the contents of the leaks. Instead, they're suggesting the whole thing is about the Russians and the Trump camp, they claim, working together.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PALMIERI: This whole effort is led by the Russians. The Russians orchestrated this hack.  JOHN PODESTA, CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN: Russian interference in this election and their apparent attempt to influence it on behalf of Mr. Trump is I think should be of utmost concern to all Americans.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And it's more than just the Clinton campaign. Now the White House is involved. Kevin Corke has more from Washington. Kevin?KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Megyn, good evening from the White House. Another near 1,200 emails dropped today by the website, WikiLeaks, these purportedly belonging to Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta, a real blockbuster here in the nation's capital, and it's just the latest in the ongoing hacking controversy, which White House officials today said, point squarely at the Russians. And while Press Secretary Josh Earnest wouldn't exactly say how the administration would respond, he did promise they would.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: But what we surely will do is deploy all of the necessary resources to protect our system and to prevent the Russians from succeeding in their attempt to undermine our political system.  (END VIDEO CLIP)CORKE: While Russian President Vladimir Putin said it doesn't matter who leaked the information, it's the content that's most important, experts here at the White House were telling us today, this is frankly, a new page in the old KGB playbook.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The fact that they even can sew some distrust, which is precisely the Russian way. They used to refer to it as compromac (ph) or compromising information or (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) deceiving others of their activities, this is part and parcel of what we've seen KGB trade craft during the cold war.CORKE: Megyn, Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to raise the issue once again on Saturday when he meets with his Russian counterpart in Switzerland. To what effect, of course, remains to be seen -- Megyn.KELLY: Kevin, good to see you.Joining me now, Carl Higbie, former Navy SEAL and Trump supporter, and Nomiki Konst, a former Bernie Sanders surrogate and host of ""The Filter"" on Sirius/XM progress. And Nomiki is getting over the fact that this was not leaked during the primary season when Bernie was still in the race, but it wasn't. It wasn't. And, you know, as hard as we've been on team Hillary for what, you know, the content of those leaks, they do have a point, that Russia messing with an American election is deeply problematic on a number of levels.  NOMIKI KONST, HOST, ""THE FILTER"" ON SIRIUS XM: Absolutely. A good Democratic friend of mine said this today. He says, it's as if we were too focused on the documents from Watergate and not enough on the break-in.  That's what really we need to be focusing on, is the break-in. That's the illegal matter. And, you know, it is true, all intelligence officials say that Guccifer and the D.C. leaks and WikiLeaks -- Guccifer provided the leaks to D.C. leaks and to WikiLeaks, and Guccifer is directly related, it is funded, it is controlled by the Russian Intelligence Agency. So, there's an absolute connection between this.And the timing couldn't be more unfortunate. And not only that, Roger Stone, who was an adviser to Donald Trump, Paul Manafort was on the books with the Ukrainian party that was controlled by Putin. You have General Allen who is in negotiations with RTTV, a television agency that is funded by the Russian government. All of these people are advising Donald Trump, have advised Donald Trump, are currently advising Donald Trump. And not only that, Donald Trump says this was just done by hackers? How do we know it wasn't some 400-pound guy in his basement? Well, he got of a national security briefing, that's how we know. He's been informed.  KELLY: You know, when Putin comes out and says, it doesn't matter who leaked, what does it matter? Just look at the content! You're welcome is what he's trying to say. It's kind of a tell.  CARL HIGBIE, FORMER NAVY SEAL: Yes, the Clinton campaign would love to make this about Russia because it takes the pressure off what the content of the emails is. Look, the fact of the matter is WikiLeaks has dropped bombs on Republicans and drop it on Democrats, they'll going to continue to drop this, but what Hillary Clinton wants to do is take pressure off what in the actual emails, the fact that they're talking about Catholics, the fact that they're talking about all of the internal workings of the campaign that are just really negative right now. It's not going to work.  KELLY: But what do you make about the fact that Roger Stone, he's out tonight saying that he does have back-channel communications with WikiLeaks, but he doesn't coordinate with WikiLeaks, which makes it sound like the Trump camp through this, you know, former adviser, and maybe current informal adviser, is working this?HIGBIE: Well, I know Nomiki, but I don't have any back channels to the liberal campaign. And so, I mean, like, it's the same kind of thing.  KELLY: But he's saying he does have back channel communications.  HIGBIE: He may know somebody over there, but look, I don't think the Russians have anything to do with this. I think that's a completely ridiculous thing. Even people say that we have ideas that it is, but there's been no proof so far.KELLY: Do you have any hesitation about as I've said before dining off the carcass of somebody's dead privacy rights? You know, Podesta's, Palmieri's, everybody's emails?HIGBIE: No. The thing is, the media, not all media, but some media has thrown the cloak of invisibility over Hillary Clinton, it's coming out through WikiLeaks now and they don't know what to do. They don't know how.  They're in crisis mode.  KONST: What would Donald Trump do if suddenly Russia hacked his taxes?  How would he feel about that?HIGBIE: Well, somebody did hacked his taxes and put it out.  KELLY: Well, they leaked it.HIGBIE: Yes. They leaked it.KELLY: By the way, General Allen endorsed Hillary Clinton.  KONST: Excuse me. General Flynn. I'm getting my generals mixed up.  Thank you for fact-checking me on that. General Flynn.  KELLY: Wait a minute.HIGBIE: Somebody did dump one year of Trump's taxes and guess what, he was like, oh, he dumped my taxes, oh, well, get over it. Didn't blame it on the Russians.KELLY: That had to be somebody who knew Trump --HIGBIE: He dealt with it and got over it.  KELLY: It didn't seem like a leak, although what the hell do I know?HIGBIE: Take responsibility.KELLY: Great to see you both.  HIGBIE: Thank you, Megyn.  KONST: Thank you, Megyn.  KELLY: Less than one week ago, Donald Trump was heard on video talking about groping women and tonight, there is an explosive series of allegations from multiple women claiming that indeed it happened to them.Chris Stirewalt and Dana Perino join us next on that breaking news.Plus, dramatic developments on the polling front. Can you spot it in this map here? Larry Sabato is here to explain. He will tell us what this change means for Election Day. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, it's been just five days since we first saw the video revealing vulgar comments about women made by Donald Trump in 2005.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I've got to use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her.  You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.  BILLY BUSH, FORMER ""ACCESS HOLLYWOOD"" HOST: Whatever you want.  TRUMP: Grab them by the (bleep). You can do anything.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That moment will become the subject of the very first question at the presidential debate just two days later, when Mr. Trump was pressed by the moderator, Anderson Cooper.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDERSON COOPER, DEBATE MODERATOR: You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?TRUMP: No, I didn't say that at all. I don't think you understood what was said. This was locker room talk.COOPER: Are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago, that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?TRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.TRUMP: So, for the record, you're saying you never did that.TRUMP: I said things -- but frankly, you hear these things that were said and I was embarrassed by it, but I have tremendous respect for women...COOPER: Have you ever done those things?TRUMP: ...and women have respect for me. And I will tell you, no, I have not.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Now, the Republican nominee is facing new scrutiny tonight as several women come forward claiming they are victims of his sexual advances. First, Jessica Leeds comes forward tonight who says she was on a flight more than 30 years ago with Trump, wound up sitting next to the young businessman in first class of a commercial air flight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JESSICA LEEDS, TRUMP ACCUSER: It wasn't until they cleared the meal that somehow or another, the armrest in the seat disappeared and it was a real shock when all of a sudden his hands were all over me. He was like an octopus. It was like he had six arms. He was all over the place. If he had stuck with the upper part of the body, I might not have gotten -- I might not have gotten that upset. So, when he started putting his hand up my skirt, and that was it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Another woman, Rachel Crooks, also speaking out to The New York Times, saying upon meeting Donald Trump in his building -- she was just 22 years old -- he ""kissed me directly on the mouth."" she was a secretary at the time. Those accusations echoing the claim made by the former Miss Utah, Temple Taggart, who earlier this year recalled being kissed by Trump without consent saying, ""He kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, oh, my God, gross.""We're also learning just as we come to air that a Florida woman has now come forward claiming to have been groped by Mr. Trump 13 years ago. She claims that he grabbed her back side against her consent. Joining me now, Chris Stirewalt and Dana Perino, co-hosts of ""Perino & Stirewalt: I'll Tell You What."" Good to see you both.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Hi, Megyn.KELLY: So, I mean, they say that listening to him at that debate, say that it was just words and he never actually did that stuff he claimed to be doing on the bus, made them come forward, these latest three. Stirewalt, put it in perspective politically what this means.STIREWALT: Look, we now have a perspective on why Trump took the bellicose attitude that he did in that debate on the subject instead of being contrite. He was on the attack and presented Bill Clinton's accusers from the 1990s and before against him. We now see why. The why is that they expected this, that they knew that this is going to be a race to the bottom and that there were going to be more allegations and more accusations of misconduct against Trump, so they're trying to steal themselves by keeping bringing back these women from Bill Clinton's past.KELLY: And there's another woman named Tasha Dixon who was part of the Miss Teen USA pageant, who gave an interview today, and here's what she alleged. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TASHA DIXON, TRUMP ACCUSER: He just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked. Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half naked changing into our bikinis. I'm telling you, Donald Trump owned the pageant for the reason to utilize his power to get, you know, around beautiful women.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Now, that's just an allegation, but it does track with what Trump himself told Howard Stern back in 2005. Listen.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)TRUMP: Well, I'll tell you the funniest is that I'll go backstage before a show.HOWARD STERN, RADIO HOST: Yes.TRUMP: And everyone's getting dressed and ready and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant, and therefore, I'm inspecting it. You know, I'm inspecting I want to make sure that everything is good.  STERN: You're like a doctor there.TRUMP: You know, the dresses. Is everyone okay? They're standing there with no clothes. Is everybody okay? And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Dana?DANA PERINO, ""THE FIVE"" CO -HOST: So, this is a pattern, right? So, he says that, and what he's said to Billy Bush he has said to Howard Stern, is that he loves being a star, because when you're a star you get to do things that, even if he's not actually doing them, right. He's like talking about it and bragging about it. And then his excuse is that, well, men do this and men talk like this in the locker room, which there's been a lot of men who have come forward and said no, we don't. The Trump supporters and the Trump campaign tonight has said that this ""The New York Times"" story is completely false, and they're questioning the timing of it.KELLY: And threatening to sue The New York Times.PERINO: They are. Here's the thing about that, though. They are expecting now for everybody that will be seeing these interviews with these women to not believe them. And one of the things they say in their statement is how dare you reach back decades and look at possible sexual assaults from way before, like how could it matter? But the problem is that's exactly what they are asking people to do when they're looking at Bill Clinton and having the people -- the women who have made allegations against Bill Clinton at the debate and doing events with them and doing interviews.I mean, that -- now it's like they're trying to just muddy the waters. I don't know if I agree with Stirewalt that they knew this was coming, partly because of the angry denial that you hear Donald Trump make to The New York Times when he's on the phone with the reporter, calling her a disgusting human being for even reporting the story.KELLY: Well, I mean, I don't want to go psychological on you, but they say anger is closely related to fear so, there. I've become Dr. Phil. Let's speak about this in a larger sense and I do want to underscore that Trump has denied these allegations. You know, both campaigns are in a pickle because the Clinton camp wants to say, oh, you know, these women who accuse Bill Clinton, he was never found guilty, they never had a successful lawsuit, it was 30 years ago.Well, these women, they never had a lawsuit, you know. And the truth is that victims of sexual assault, victims of rape, victims of unwanted groping, they often don't come forward. They're humiliated, especially back in the day. They were told move along, it happens to all women, you've got to take it. It's a complicated issue.PERINO: Because it would hurt your career.KELLY: That's right. It's a complicated situation. The 22-year-old secretary in Trump Tower is like, it's Donald Trump, right?PERINO: She calls her sister.KELLY: It's not to say it's real. I don't know whether it happened or not. I'm just saying these matters are complicated. But what's not complicated, Stirewalt, is how disgusting so many people feel about this election season and how grossed out they are by it, a feeling that was encapsulated by John Oliver a couple of nights ago. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN OLIVER, HBO LAST WEEK TONIGHT SHOW HOST: Let me just remind you that last Sunday, I told you, if you looked above the clouds, you would see rock bottom. But if you look up there now, just way, way, way up there, all the way up high, you will see right up in the distance where we were this time last week. Because since then, we have sunk so low, we are breaking through the earth's crust, where drowning in boiling magma will come as sweet, sweet relief.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And it's true when you hear these allegations...STIREWALT: Fact-check mostly true.KELLY: And honestly on twitter the other day, there was a picture of somebody at a Trump rally wearing a shirt that talked about the ""C"" word and Hillary Clinton, and there's been a few of these.STIREWALT: Yeah, yeah.KELLY: And it just makes you feel bad.STIREWALT: Like somewhere, Alexander Hamilton is weeping into some sort of a kerchief? Yes.KELLY: He's like, remember back in the day when we did it correct, we just shot each other?STIREWALT: And just shot each other in Weehawken, New Jersey.KELLY: He's known to judge, although he did die.STIREWALT: He did die. He definitely died. Look, the thing for Trump is, he has a choice. They want -- the political playbook says now go destroy these women. Women have come forward to make allegations, now go destroy them, discredit them, say they're liars, say they're crazy, say they're psychos, rip them apart. Unfortunately, the gambit that they and their campaign manager used was to try to shame Hillary Clinton for destroying the women who accused her husband.KELLY: Interesting point.STIREWALT: So, they have put themselves in a heck of a box here because they need to destroy the credibility of these women, but it is the destroying of women's credibility that they're trying to hoist Hillary Clinton on.KELLY: Meantime, the polls that came out, this Marquette University poll out of Wisconsin today just shows a cratering with the women. Look at this. Saturday and Sunday it was -- look at the gender gap there that grew as the tape took hold, right? It hit on Friday and it was 60 percent of women for Clinton, 33 percent for Trump, and it had been 45 - 36 just the day before, you know, a closer margin. And then it evened out over Saturday and Sunday to 56 - 23.If you look at the gender gap in all the states, the 538 block put this together today and you could see, I mean she's killing him with women. He's beating her with men. You can see this. But his numbers are -- he doesn't have as big a margin. Her margin with women is getting scary for him.PERINO: And I think there are probably a lot of women who thought, I would never vote for Hillary Clinton who is being presented with that choice. The other thing that's very interesting in terms of the statistic and the Trump campaign has known this from the beginning, and so has the Hillary campaign -- in 2016, the entire electorate of eligible voters, 31 percent are single women, OK?And that is going to continue to grow. So, when we have the big fight after the election about what the Republican Party is going to look like going forward, that obviously has to be a consideration, because that is not going to change.KELLY: Right, the women, they're everywhere now, as it turns out.PERINO: And they can vote!STIREWALT: Wait a minute, what? Whoa, whoa...KELLY: All that crap about equality. They apparently really mean it. It's like, like we actually want to be treated as equal citizens. It's so crazy now. Okay, great to see you both.STIREWALT: Bye, guys.KELLY: And in just one week from tonight for the first time ever, a Fox News anchor will be moderating a general election presidential debate. I know, we're very happy about this. Award-winning journalist Chris Wallace widely regarded as one of the best questioners in the business -- did he write this? -- will moderate the all-important final debate between Trump and Clinton.This make or break event less than three weeks before the historic election of 2016 will be held in Vegas baby, October 19th. It's Wednesday night, Vegas, best place to watch the Fox-moderated debate is yeah, right here on the Fox News Channel.And then stay tuned for a special ""Kelly File"" live at 11:00 p.m. that night with a complete wrap up and analysis of the night's biggest moments. I've seen all the questions and I'm handing them right now to both of -- no, that's not what we do. Okay, I haven't seen any of the questions either, which is sad, because I'd like to.Anyway, 27 days to go and the electoral prediction map is shifting yet again. Larry Sabato is here on the red states, the blue states and the state of the race, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Twenty-seven days to go, and tonight a state that has voted Republican in every single presidential election since 1964 is now a toss- up. In a surprise development to some, Utah is now up for grabs on November 8th, according to the Fox News decision desk. We have Dr. Larry Sabato with us tonight on what the change means for election day. But first, we turn to Trace Gallagher to crunch the numbers. Trace?GALLAGHER: Megyn, the primary reason Utah is now a toss-up is because Donald Trump is very unpopular with Mormons, who make up 60 percent of the state's voters. For the record, Hillary Clinton isn't exactly loved in Utah, which is why Evan McMullen is pulling almost even with both Trump and Clinton. McMullen is an independent, BYU grad, and a Mormon.We should note this poll is from Y2 Analytics and it's the only Utah poll released so far that was taken after the Trump/Billy Bush tape was released. And one poll says 94 percent of Utahns have seen or heard about the tape. In August, Trump had a double-digit lead in Utah, and for Trump, Utah is the canary in a coal mine. The last time the state voted Democrat was Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and now it's anyone's game. But even without Utah, the Fox News decision team says if Hillary Clinton wins the states rated solid Democrat along with the states leaning Democrat, she'd come out with 307 electoral votes.She only needs 270 to win the presidency. If Trump wins the solid Republican states along with the states currently seen as leaning Republican, he would still only have 181 electoral votes. Here's the bigger problem for Trump -- even if you give him all the toss-up states, that still only puts him at 231 electoral votes, which means not only is Utah a must-win for Trump, he would also have to steal some states that currently lean Democrat, Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you. Joining me now with more, the director of UVA Center for Politics, Larry Sabato. Great to see you, doc. So, let's talk about Utah, first of all. Is that real? Could that actually go Democrat?LARRY SABATO, UVA CENTER FOR POLITICS DIRECTOR: Well, when I saw it about 5:00 a.m. this morning, Megyn, I figured my eyes weren't focusing.KELLY: Right?SABATO: And once I realized those really were the numbers, I thought a bunch of excess Californians had moved into Utah.KELLY: They got lost.SABATO: Because Utah -- exactly. They got lost and wandered in the desert. Utah, as Trace just said, reliably Republican and we're talking about 70 percent Republican. Ronald Reagan used to get over 70 percent in Utah. So, it's a shock. I always say this, Megyn, I want to see confirmation.This is the first poll that shows it being effectively a three-way tie, and you always have questions, particularly when an independent does this well, though there are reasons. He is a Mormon, BYU grad and clearly, the Mormon population is not terribly keen on Donald Trump. And of course, Mitt Romney, who has a lot of influence in Utah, is not either.KELLY: And that would be interesting. Mitt Romney didn't make much of an impact when he came after Trump in the primaries, but perhaps he's playing a role in denying him those electoral votes now. Meantime, you say Florida, Ohio and Arizona, another state that's usually red, are likely or safe Republican now? Do you believe that? Do you believe Florida and Ohio are safe Republican?SABATO: Oh, no. Our map has Florida leaning to Clinton, Ohio cleaning to Clinton. We still have Arizona with Donald Trump, but I have to tell you...KELLY: My notes are wrong here.SABATO: ...privately, some of the trackings for both Arizona and Georgia are suggesting that Clinton is very competitive in both of those states. If Trump loses either one of them, he's cooked and done.KELLY: He can't lose -- wait, either one of which?SABATO: Arizona and Georgia -- Arizona and Georgia. Florida, of course he's done if he loses Florida.KELLY: Yes, right.SABATO: But already Clinton has a lead there. The average is about 3 1/2, 4 points in Florida. She's ahead a little bit in North Carolina. She's ahead a little bit in Ohio in the polling average. They can still change, but you know, I'd be concerned if I were on the Trump camp about some of these red states, not just Utah, but also Arizona and Georgia.KELLY: Because now the priorities USA super PAC is actually moving beyond the race for the White House. They're targeting more the lower, the other races focused on the senate and so on. And some Democrats are saying, well, they're extremely confident they're going to capture control of the Senate because everybody's going to go to the polls, they believe, to support Hillary. Do you believe that? Do you believe control of the Senate and even the House may be in danger?SABATO: Well, certainly the Senate is. I'd be very surprised if the House flipped. The Senate could go either way. We've got it 47 Republicans 47 Democrats with six toss ups...KELLY: Anything could happen.SABATO: And those toss-ups will determine the control of the Senate.KELLY: Great to see you, Larry. Up next, Republicans and Donald Trump signs. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: In an election cycle that has both campaigns rocked by R rated controversies and behavior allegedly bordering on the criminal, this next story may seem a little tame by comparison. But Republicans in one small Connecticut town decided they had enough with their Trump sign being run over, ripped off and generally vandalized, and they decided to get even. Trace Gallagher picks up the mystery from there. Trace.GALLAGHER: Megyn, Wilton, Connecticut, is a town of 18,000 in Fairfield County with an average family income of $300,000. Now in Wilton there are signs of Trump taking a beating literally. Trump Pence signs are being ripped up, stomped on and run over. But the vandals may not roam these wealthy streets for long.City officials have now put up surveillance cameras to record these Trump trumps and are releasing the pictures to the public in hopes of identifying and punishing the culprits. Wilton Republican Town committee chairman Al Alper says the video shows various cars running over campaign signs that are just off the curb. He said so far, at least a dozen campaign signs had been ""mutilated or stolen.""You can see one picture showing two young females running up to the signs, but the damage they did is unclear. Alper is turning all the pictures over to police and hopes the sign bandits will be punished. He doesn't consider the suspects vandals but does say they represent intolerance for freedom of speech. Wilton isn't the only town to tear up Trump signs. In Phoenix, someone covered a Make America Great Again billboard in swastikas.In Haverhill, Massachusetts, surveillance video captured a man spray painting the word never over a Trump sign and this is what's left of a Trump sign in South Bend, Indiana, and circling back to Wilton, e should notice, a 17-year-old boy has already turned herself in knowing that he was caught on camera.KELLY: Trace, thanks.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Have you been feeling a little extra happy during the broadcast? It's subliminal. I was projecting that to you. I dressed the part. Who didn't love that show back in the day? Am I dating myself? What? Thanks for watching everybody. I'm Megyn Kelly. See you tomorrow.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/03/16/sen-mark-warner-to-gop-colleagues-do-your-job/	Sen. Mark Warner to GOP colleagues: 'Do your job'	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" March 16, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: All right. This much, it seems that Republicans and Democrats are in agreement on. When it comes to certainly qualified potential Supreme Court justices, Merrick Garland is that, and then some, number one, Harvard, summa cum laude, Harvard Law, very instrumental in getting behind the whole Timothy McVeigh thing.I could go on and on and on. But everyone seems to say he has impeccable credentials. So, certainly, he's qualified to serve on the nation's highest court. So, it's not about the guy as much as it is about the timing and the picking of the guy. You have already heard Republicans say we don't even consider this until after the November election.And they are sticking to that.Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner from Virginia -- I said from Virginia -- says that that is not the right way to do it.All right. So, you know what they said, Senator. That is, hey, Democrats play these kind of shenanigans with us. I think they call something like this payback. What do you say?SEN. MARK WARNER, D, VIRGINIA: Neil, I mean, what part of the Constitution says a president shouldn't appoint a Supreme Court justice in the last year of their term?I mean, this is pretty simple stuff. I'm generally pretty bipartisan. I acknowledge that both sides make mistakes. But this one is pretty clear. Do your job. The president nominated somebody. He's qualified. There's never been a nominee who hasn't at least received a hearing.If some of my Republican colleagues want to go ahead and vote against him, that's their right. That's their constitutional obligation. But to not even hold a hearing, I mean, this is pretty unprecedented.CAVUTO: Well, they're using, Senator, something called a Joe Biden rule, that in the last year you don't even consider it. So, they say blame Joe.And they're saying, and they're saying -- and they're saying -- I'm just telling you what they're saying.WARNER: Neil...CAVUTO: Leave me out.They're saying, remember Senator Barack Obama when he played these kind of games. What I see, Senator, is both sides playing games with this. And that's fine. I understand politics. What happens now?WARNER: But let's actually -- let's look at the -- but let's look at the facts for a second, Neil.On this one, I have seen the comments Biden made. And my understanding, that was about somebody that might resign. This was not a case of somebody where the justices died. It was much later in the year.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Do you honestly think, Senator, that Joe Biden would have changed his mind on that if something like this had happened?WARNER: I know that this -- I know that the Constitution is pretty clear. The president nominates, the Senate shall advise and consent.There's none of this punt in terms of the last year.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: No, I hear what you're saying, but they say the Constitution provides for what they're doing here.Part of advising and consenting is saying, we have advised that we're not going to take this up until after the election. You say what?WARNER: Then hold a hearing. If they choose to vote against Mr. Garland, who seems to me to be pretty darn qualified -- I'm looking forward to meeting him -- then vote their conscience and vote against him.CAVUTO: Right.WARNER: But the idea of simply saying more political dysfunction is good for what's going on in Washington, you understand why people in both political parties are voting for outliers, because we who are supposed to be putting the countries first...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Well, you know what I have noticed here, Senator? And this is a rap on Democrats and Republicans. There's something about the last year of a president's term, the last year of a congressional term.I guess it's just accepted nothing will get done. Nothing gets done on the budgets. Nothing gets done legislatively. The Republicans argue, we can't take up a serious issue like this in an election year. I have heard Democrats argue that. Nothing gets done.(CROSSTALK)WARNER: Neil, you have been in business. I spent my career in business.Do you know any other place where every fourth or eighth year, you say, OK, we're not going to do anything this year? It's not like the rest of the world is taking the year off.CAVUTO: No, I don't. No, I don't. But it feeds this narrative thatBut both sides sort of cease and desist bridging a gap. And you're an exception. I will say, you will reach across the aisle. But that is almost poison these days to even talk that way. So, nothing gets done. So, I think we should cut all terms by one year.My problem with that, leave out the last year, then the last year of that cut year will become a nothing getting done year. It is ridiculous.WARNER: And that is more dysfunction on top of dysfunction. That's just not what -- and people are angry.I think you wouldn't see the kind of vote particularly for Trump that you have seen if there wasn't that level of anger. So let's do what the Constitution says. The president nominated somebody. Let's review them. If you want to vote against him, that's your constitutional right.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Right. Well, actually, no, Senator, I will accept that. I actually agree with you on that.Here's what worries me, though, because they go back. And it's like I have two teenage boys, Senator, and they go at each other, not all the time -- actually most of the time.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: And I have to separate them. And it sounds like, well, I have had Republicans on: Well, they did that to us when we were here. And Biden and then Senator Obama, and he's a hypocrite.And I can remember back then, covering prior Supreme Court appointments, well, you should see what the Republicans did to us when we were in this same situation.And I'm going nuts. Like, all right, let's say both parties were guilty of playing small politics. Someone is going to have to rise above this and say this is stupid. And, by the way, while we move on this, and yea or nay on this judge, why don't we get a budget accord together, why don't we talk about tax reform?But everything freezes. Everything freezes.WARNER: Well, listen, that is why somebody like Mike McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, are not taking that approach on something as important as digital security.We're saying we have got to deal with this encryption Apple-FBI issue. Let's get experts in the room and solve it. This is not a problem that is going to go away. It's why I have been working on a whole series of issues around...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: But everything freezes. Everything freezes.WARNER: Well, let's actually try to prove it wrong on this case, at least in terms of following what the Constitution says.I understand why people are mad and they want to throw stuff at the TV. I'm mad, too. And you and I are both inside the TV. We have got to do better.CAVUTO: Yes.Real quickly, are you going to be Hillary Clinton's vice president?WARNER: I am supporting Hillary Clinton, but I think my value-add is to try to actually get some of these folks on both sides to sit down and work out some of these issues, particularly when it comes to the budget.CAVUTO: Well, they like you a lot on the other side of the aisle. There's a great deal to count for that.They don't flip over her. I'm not trying to disparage her. But they don't flip over her. You would be a good bridge for that. Would you entertain that?WARNER: Hey, what I'm going to entertain is trying to make the Senate work in a better and more functional way.CAVUTO: I have never, in all the years have I done this, when I have asked someone about, would you ever be a running mate, they handle it just as deftly as you did there.So, I guess that's a way of saying you're not going to say.WARNER: Not my first rodeo.CAVUTO: I got you.All right, Senator, very good having you. I appreciate it.WARNER: Thank you, Neil. Yes, sir.CAVUTO: All right. Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

6	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/01/29/bill-oreilly-is-terrorism-overwhelming-obama-administration/	Bill O'Reilly: Is terrorism overwhelming the Obama administration?	"Former defense intelligence agency chief Lt. General Michael Flynn slammed the White House for not having a strategy to fight the jihad; also for refusing to use the term Islamic militants. General Flynn saying, quote: ""You cannot defeat an enemy you do not admit exists"", unquote.Flynn who worked for President Obama now joins a host of other former Obama officials in telling the world the administration has no plan to defeat Islamic terrorism. And that's true. ""Talking Points"" has been chronicling that for months.Here's the latest. Ten Democratic senators now telling President Obama that if there is no progress in the Iranian nuke negotiations by March, they will join with Republicans in embarrassing him in passing sanctions against Iran. Now, that country is a centerpiece of the terror war right now. If Iran gets a nuke, the jihad gains incredible power.Remember the Iranian mullahs want to spread the Shia brand of Islam and also want to destroy Israel and the United States. The mullahs as well as other Islamic fanatics believe Barack Obama is a weak leader -- no question.And then there is the Bowe Bergdahl situation again tied into the jihad. As you know, Sergeant Bergdahl was traded for five top Taliban terrorists back in May of last year. These men will most likely return to the battlefield to fight against America. Meantime, Bergdahl apparently left the battlefield deserting his unit in Afghanistan. Right now Sergeant Bergdahl is at the Fort Sam Houston barracks in Texas awaiting his fate.The army interviewed the sergeant way back in August. And by all counts investigation has been completed for months. Yet, there is no definition.The Factor broke a story earlier this week that says the White House is pressuring the Pentagon to go easy on Bergdahl. That's why Gen. Mark Milley has not reported back to we the people.Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer says the army has come to the conclusion that Bergdahl did indeed dessert. The army denies that but Shaffer's standing by his story which has also been reported by NBC News.But here is the nuance. There are different kinds of desertion and that is giving the army some wiggle room. The White House desperately doesn't want a trial where members of Bergdahl's unit would testify under oath that he put their lives in danger. We've already seen and heard that on TV. So President Obama would prefer that Bergdahl be charged with going AWOL Absent without Leave. Then he could be quietly punished with no big exposition.But the facts show that Bergdahl did desert his unit. Was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan because of the desertion, and held by them for five years. So the sane way to do this is to charge Bergdahl with desertion and then on humanitarian grounds the President would pardon him. But the sergeant would lose back pay and be dishonorably discharged. That's what should happen.And there is more. The military is not supposed to be influenced by politics. The Pentagon is supposed apolitical but Colonel Shaffer reports politics is influencing the Bergdahl situation big time. If that's true, we the people need to know about it.Bottom line, ""Talking Points"" believes the army knows exactly what Bergdahl did and is stonewalling the process. As always I could be wrong.That's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.TUCKER CARLSON, GUEST HOST:  Welcome to the ""Hannity"" TV program.  It's the Clinton scandal that just won't go away.I'm Tucker Carlson, in tonight for Sean.New revelations this afternoon about Hillary Clinton's lingering e-mail controversy, this after the FBI published brand-new documents related to its now closed investigation into the former secretary of state.Joining us now with the very latest on this is our own Catherine Herridge -- Catherine.CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This 11-page FBI summary of Hillary Clinton's July 2nd interview shows the former secretary of state could not remember key details about her e-mails more than two dozen times.Critics aren't buying it.CHRISTOPHER FARRELL, JUDICIAL WATCH:  What is implausible, not someone of her background, experience, training -- she's an attorney, 25 years in government, and suddenly, she has selective amnesia?  It's not plausible. It's not believable.HERRIDGE:  Clinton told FBI agents she could not recall where she got a security clearance.  Clinton could not recall briefings or training on the handling of classified information.  And Clinton could not recall specialize training for the U.S. government's most closely held secrets, known as Special Access Programs.But the same week Clinton became secretary of state, she signed two non- disclosure agreements, where she said she knew the rules and that violating these agreements could result in criminal charges.Clinton also told the FBI that she could not recall the details surrounding the 2009 setup of the Clintonemail.com domain, whose servers were housed at the Chappaqua, New York, home.  Clinton said the personal e-mail account was a matter of convenience.  FBI agents do not appear to press Clinton on the issue, further reinforcing Republican criticism of the FBI director and the investigation.REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Remember, James Comey said she was not indicted because he didn't have sufficient evidence on the issue of intent.  She said she did it for convenience, but -- but I didn't see the follow-up questions in the interview I read!HERRIDGE:  The heavily redacted FBI summary also shows Clinton was questioned about the 22 top secret e-mails too damaging to release for national security reasons, and that questioning included the drone campaign, as well as human spying for CIA programs -- Tucker.CARLSON:  Catherine Herridge, thanks a lot, Catherine.Here with reaction, former Republican presidential candidates Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Dr. Ben Carson.  It is great to see you both.Dr. Carson, first to you.  This is kind of definitive, then.  Hillary Clinton says, I didn't know the rules.  That's not a plausible explanation, is it?DR. BEN CARSON, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It's not a plausible explanation, and her failure to remember anything certainly is not a quality that you would want to see in a president.CARLSON:  So I'm assuming you buy it, then.  Do you think she wasn't capable of remembering the most basic rules in handling classified material?CARSON:  Well, it doesn't particularly matter.  If she wasn't capable of remembering that, she definitely would not be capable of performing the duties of the president, and if she is lying about it, then that disqualifies her, too.  I think she's disqualified, either way you look at it.CARLSON:  So Governor Huckabee, just take three steps back.  We're finding out about this from the FBI on the afternoon of Labor Day weekend, on a Friday on a holiday weekend.  This is a classic way to bury news that you think is going to be damaging to the principal.  The FBI is not a political organization, but this move suggests they're acting for political reasons.Do you think that's true?  And if so, how discouraging is that, for a law enforcement agency to help a political campaign?MIKE HUCKABEE, R-FORMER PRES. CANDIDATE:  Well, the FBI has always been above and beyond the political ramifications.  It's one of the reasons that most Americans have an incredibly high respect for the FBI.This hurts the FBI's reputation.  It hurts James Comey's reputation.  But most of all, it damages Hillary Clinton.I mean, for her to claim that she has less memory about what she was briefed on than Jason Bourne knew about his past identity is just not realistic.  And I agree with Ben Carson.  If she really doesn't remember fundamental facts of national security like this, then she has no business being sworn in as president, and we need to make sure the American people don't make what could be an incredibly irrevocable mistake.CARLSON:  So Dr. Carson, these 60 pages suggest more stories to come, in this way.  You have Hillary Clinton in the FBI's account losing somehow 13 different PDAs, cell phones.  You have her using her device in foreign countries.  You have her with a skiff (ph), which is supposed to be a bug- proof room in her house and office, that is not secure.  This suggests that she was more vulnerable even than we knew to attacks by foreign intelligence agencies.Do you think we're going to be hearing that story before Election Day?CARSON:  I hope so.  But here's the other thing that we have to consider. Because she had such vital information in such insecure places, I think probably the Chinese, the Russians and some others probably have some of that information.Now, what would it be like to have a president who could be blackmailed by other nations because they have information that she doesn't want to come out?CARLSON:  Well, that is the question.  That is absolutely the question. And I think it's a major concern for the intelligence agencies in this country.Governor Huckabee, tell us -- I mean you, of course, are from Arkansas. You were a three-term governor of Arkansas.  You know the Clintons very well.  They're smart people.  They try to cover all the bases.  They're paranoid.  They're aware of their public perception.Why would Mrs. Clinton behave in a manner this reckless?  What would motivate her to do that?HUCKABEE:  Because for so long, Tucker, she and her husband have gotten away with living by a different set of rules than everybody else.  You know, we remember back in 2008, the big banks were protected because they were too big to fail.  And I think what we have is a Hillary Clinton who thinks she's too big to jail.  She thinks that these rules that apply to everybody else in government are for them, for the little people, but not for her.  And that's very troubling.And this is not a political issue.  I know it's going to sound like it, and coming from me -- look, I don't pretend that I'm non-partisan.  I'm very partisan.  I have a very particular point of view.  But try to look at this objectively.  And let's remember that she said, well, she only had one device.  Now we know she got rid of 13 different devices.So there are so many things that have just been said that are fundamentally not true, and she can't possibly say that she just didn't remember how many devices that she had when there were 13 of them.CARLSON:  So Dr. Carson, the whole point of America, the whole reason people come here from other countries, who yearn to be Americans, is because we're equal under the law, all of us.  And this puts a lie to that. What do you say to the numerous Americans who are now doing jail time or have felony records for mishandling, in some cases they claim unintentionally, classified information.CARSON:  Well, I say I'm sorry that you are the victims of an unfair system.  And you know, as Governor Huckabee alluded to, this kind of issue, it's really not a Democrat or Republican issue.  This goes to the very heart of who we are as a nation, who we are as people.What do we accept?  What kinds of leaders do we want to put up in front of our children as examples?  If we put somebody up who lies as easily as they breathe, and this is our greatest role model, what can we expect from the next generation of Americans?CARLSON:  That's a deep question.  I mean, Governor Huckabee, I don't think Hillary Clinton is the worst person in the world at all, but I think that this behavior is clearly unacceptable.  There's no defending it at all, and yet Democrats are defending it.Donald Trump has said things that are hard to defend, and a lot of Republicans said, You know, I'm not going to defend it.  That's wrong.  And they've walked away from him.  You haven't seen anything like that on the Democratic side.  It's been lockstep robotic support for their candidate.Do you think you're going to see any Democrats of conscience say, I'm sorry, I'm not going to defend this behavior?HUCKABEE:  Publicly, probably not.  I've always admired the Democrats for circling the wagons around the people that they're trying to protect, no matter how ridiculous it is.  And we've seen that not only with Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, but with Barack Obama.  I mean, they just always sort of say, No, our side does nothing wrong.But this is troubling, and it needs to be to independent voters, people who really want America to be a place where everybody gets treated the same, where Lady Justice is blindfolded and presiding over scales that balance justice and mercy, not campaign and contributions to the Clinton Foundation on one side of the scale and favors on the other.  And that's the kind of White House we would have with Hillary Clinton.CARLSON:  Yes, boy, I don't admire that lockstep at all because I think it betrays the real point of Democratic politics, which is not so sort of act on behalf of some principle, but to acquire power and use power.  And I don't think that's a good reason to get into politics.CARSON:  But at so me point, we have to ask ourselves, Who are we?CARLSON:  Yes.CARSON:  What kind of people are we, and what do we represent, and not what is politically expedient and what will help our party to do better.  And if that's the road we're going to go down, we're doomed.CARLSON:  Man, I hope if Trump ever did something like this -- or you know, whatever Trump does, I'm not going to be there robotically defending it. You got to stick to your principles.  (INAUDIBLE)Hey, thank you, gentlemen.  It's great to see you both.  Thanks for putting it all into context.  I appreciate it.  Governor Huckabee...HUCKABEE:  You bet.CARLSON:  ... thanks.CARSON:  Absolutely.CARLSON:  Coming up right here on ""Hannity"" next...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I believe and have said many times that I take classified material seriously, and there were no materials that were marked classified.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  We've got more reaction to the FBI's new report on Hillary's e- mail server.  How damaging will these revelations be to her campaign?And then watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  To those suffering, I say what do you have to lose in trying Trump!(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  Donald Trump has been reaching out to black voters.  Tomorrow, he's set to speak at a black church in the city of Detroit.  David Webb, Eric Guster here to react to that and a whole lot more straight ahead on ""Hannity.""  Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone on my e-mail.  There is no classified material.  So I'm certainly well aware of the classification requirements,-- and I had not sent classified material nor received anything marked classified.I did not send classified material, and I did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified.I believe and have said many times that I take classified material seriously, and there were no materials that were marked classified.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  Boy, you can just pick her statements at random, and the FBI has proved them false.Welcome back to the ""Hannity"" TV program.That was, of course, the former secretary of state denying over and over again that there was classified material on her private e-mail account.  Of course, we now know that's not true at all.There are multiple instances of classified material housed in her private e-mail system, for those who care, and according to documents released this afternoon by the FBI, new questions are now being raised about her careless handling of state secrets that have put this country at risk, and it's not an overstatement.  It actually happened.Joining us now with analysis, Fox News contributor, former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen and Republican strategist Noelle Nikpour.  It's great to see you both.Doug, look, I'm not arguing that Hillary Clinton, you know, gave the hydrogen bomb to the Soviets, but I am arguing what's obvious, which is if a normal citizen had done this, he'd be indicted.  And you know that's true.  So how can you look at what Hillary did and the response from the Justice Department and not conclude the system is actually rigged in favor of people with power?DOUG SCHOEN, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  Here's what I would tell you.  Secretary Clinton, as a Democrat of conscience, clearly made profound errors.  The FBI said it was extremely careless, not gross negligence.Tucker, this is politics.  And you know what?  I don't defend it.  I was troubled, deeply troubled, by what I saw today.  That being said, as a Democrat, I still support Secretary Clinton.  But these are troubling, troubling revelations, rest assured.CARLSON:  Look, I'm not even attacking Hillary Clinton.  I think this is what Hillary Clinton does.  I think it's what she's always done, no more than you can attack a scorpion for stinging you.  That's what they do.I'm attacking the Obama Justice Department for subverting justice on behalf of the Democratic nominee because I think it hurts the entire country and the system itself.NOELLE NIKPOUR, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Right.  You know, and if you look at everything that she's done and you go back and look, some of the problem that she said is she was, like, I don't recall, 39 times, I don't recall. And if you look back in 2012, you remember when she had the concussion, and the doctor had cleared her.CARLSON:  Right.NIKPOUR:  The doctor had cleared her for two hours a day to be working at the State Department, OK?Now, here's where I lay (ph), or you want to look at something else.  Where was the Obama administration?  Where were the higher-ups that allowed her to go back and be briefed on our national security and things going on with the State Department when she didn't get the 100 percent, when she couldn't put in a full day's work?I mean, this is -- somewhere, there is more fault than also just Hillary Clinton and her ""I don't know, I don't know.""CARLSON:  Well, that's a fair question.  So Doug, look, all the Hillary toadies in the press -- and that's basically everybody, Politico, The Washington Post -- are saying that anyone who raises questions about her health is engaged in a conspiracy theory.  And I'm not, actually.  But after reading these 60 pages where she repeatedly says, I have no memory, of things that a normal person would remember, why shouldn't I be kind of concerned about her memory, honestly?SCHOEN:  I think those are fair questions, Tucker, but you talk about the Obama Justice Department.  Last I checked, James Comey is an independent operator, a Republican who has a reputation for probity and integrity.  So I would look at him, as well as the Justice Department.CARLSON:  Well, but I agree with you...(CROSSTALK)CARLSON:  I agree with you.  Seriously, look, you've run -- you're a sophisticated political guy.  You don't drop 60 pages of controversial material on the Friday afternoon before Labor Day weekend unless you're doing it for political reasons.  James Comey is not supposed to be a political actor.  He's the head of the FBI.  Why is he...(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN:  Why don't you ask him?CARLSON:  It's a great question!SCHOEN:  Ask the FBI.CARLSON:  Like, what is going on...SCHOEN:  You know, I think those are fair questions.(CROSSTALK)CARLSON:  It's absolutely ridiculous!SCHOEN:  Well, this isn't a third world.  It's the United States of America...CARLSON:  I know!SCHOEN:  ... where a government of rule of law -- and you should ask them those questions, rather than just fulminating about it.CARLSON:  Well, you know what?  I don't have access to them, just to you. So tonight, you're their surrogate, and I'm going to fulminate because I can't control myself!SCHOEN:  Well, fulminate all you want.CARLSON:  I'm fulminating away!SCHOEN:  You know what?  This is politics.  This is politics.  Secretary Clinton dodged a bullet literally and metaphorically, remains slightly ahead, and that's what this is all about in her terms and the American people's terms.CARLSON:  I don't know if she did it literally, but we can talk off air. So I already said I'm not surprised by anything Hillary does.  But I just -- you know, you got to kind of take this information as it comes, and I just can't resist playing this following clip.  It's one of a thousand we could have picked against which we are comparing reality.  Here's Hillary Clinton on the number of devices she used as secretary of state.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails instead of two.  I think that it might have been smarter to have those two devices from the very beginning.QUESTION:  IPhone or Android?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON:  IPhone, OK, in full disclosure...QUESTION:  Blackberry.CLINTON:  ... and a blackberry.  I have a -- you know, an iPad, a mini- iPad, an iPhone and a Blackberry.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  Turns out she had 13 Blackberries.  And by the way, who asks a question like that?  Talk about the endless sucking up by celebrity news figures to Hillary Clinton (INAUDIBLE) stomach-turning.  But it turns out she had 13, and she doesn't know where they are!NIKPOUR:  She had 13.  She has iPads.  She has Blackberries.  She has every device in the world, and that's great, and she still can't remember anything with all the backup of all the devices she has, number one!And number two, an aide even said that he saw them smashing a couple of them with a hammer!  I mean, you've got to look at this!  This is insane! And this is somebody that's running for president of the United States with this investigation that she was found clean, and she is -- she's running for our -- the highest office in the United States?CARLSON:  (INAUDIBLE) I think.  So Doug, you spent a lot of time around government, obviously, and in Washington, and you know how unbelievably uptight the executive branch is about security.  I mean, they really are. We got the skiffs.  They don't allow personal e-mail in the White House.   You know all this because you've lived it.Why didn't someone in the building say, Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You know, We don't do that around here.  Like, your skiff, your secure communications room, has to be secure, and yours isn't.  Like, why didn't someone raise an alarm?SCHOEN:  You know, I think these are again fair questions.  The problem is the Obama Justice Department, the Obama White House clearly let Secretary Clinton do what she did.  She's been shown by the FBI to have been extremely careless, not to have committed indictable offenses.  That's the way it'll be.  There'll be more revelations.I'll say one thing.  Free advice.  She should get out of the Clinton Foundation right now.  It will only help her chances of being elected.CARLSON:  Yes, I don't think they will.  They're very money-centered, the Clintons, as you know, very...(CROSSTALK)CARLSON:  They're greedier than any finance guy I've ever met!SCHOEN:  Money is money.  Winning is winning.  And this is about elections.CARLSON:  It's so gross!  Oh!(CROSSTALK)CARLSON:  Thank you for coming on, Doug.  I appreciate it.  You too, Noelle.  Thanks a lot, both of you.SCHOEN:  Thank you.CARLSON:  Coming up next right here on the ""Hannity"" program...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  To those suffering, I say what do you have to lose in trying Trump!(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  That's the pitch.  What do you have to lose?  That's what he's saying to African-American voters on the campaign trail.  That's what he'll be saying tomorrow at a black church in Detroit.  David Webb and Eric Guster react to all of it coming up next.And then later on the show...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We will build a great wall along the southern border.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP:  And Mexico will pay for the wall, believe me.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  The great wall of Trump.  The elites scoff knowingly, but actually most people kind of like it.  Why wouldn't they?  This week, Trump unveiled his immigration plan.  How does it compare to Hillary Clinton's? That's the question.  What would she do if elected?  We'll tell you, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  This is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.  It can't get any worse!  To those suffering, I say what do you have to lose in trying Trump!  What do you have to lose!(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  That was, of course, Donald Trump on the campaign trail, making his pitch to black voters.  Tomorrow, he's headed to Detroit, where he's going to address a black church and tour parts of the city with Dr. Ben Carson.Here with reaction, FOX News contributor and Sirius XM Patriot host David Webb and trial attorney and political commentator, our old friend, Eric Guster.  Welcome to you both.So Eric, Hillary Clinton said the other day that Trump was racist for bringing this message before a white audience.  Now he's going before a black audience tomorrow and he's going to bring the same message.  She'll probably call him a racist again.  He's probably not going to win a huge percentage of the black vote.But what's wrong with his message?  Pretty great message, isn't it?  Like, it's not working, let's try something new.  Why is that bad?ERIC GUSTER, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  What he's saying was the equivalent of the drunk guy at last call saying, Hey, you have nothing to lose, so go home with me.  That is what Trump was telling these voters.(CROSSTALK)DAVID WEBB, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  Did you just call the black community at the drunk guy at the bar?GUSTER:  No, he's the drunk guy at the bar trying to get the girl to go home with him because he's saying, I'm the last resort.  You know, you all are in bad shape.(CROSSTALK)GUSTER:  Yes, he is!WEBB:  No, he's not.GUSTER:  That's what he said!  That is exactly what he said.(CROSSTALK)CARLSON:  Can I ask you a really quick question?GUSTER:  Sure.CARLSON:  Do you think it is working in Detroit and Chicago?(CROSSTALK)GUSTER:  Trump's message to black people?CARLSON:  No, no, the urban policy we've had for 50 years.  Kind of working pretty well, do you think?GUSTER:  No.  Are we talking about Trump?(CROSSTALK)GUSTER:  I want him to say exactly what he said right there again.WEBB:  So let's go to the issue and answer your question because I was in Detroit just a week ago, and I took a drive through some of these neighborhoods that are blighted and some of these, you know, beautiful old neighborhoods that have been razed, some of them, buildings, closed-up business, closed up.I look at some of the cities that have failed since the '60s like Newark, New Jersey, fifth ward in Houston, parts of East LA.  All across this country, we have seen failure by these so-called promises from the Democrats to the black community, and frankly, the new -- by one -- let's call it what it is -- masters of the black community with the Congressional Black Caucus.You look at the policies, you look at the failures, the failure in education, the failure in economy.  You talk about urban flight, where companies have fled from high-crime zones.  Chicago just...(CROSSTALK)WEBB:  Let me finish.GUSTER:  ... an auto town and a lot of the shift in the auto industry is what caused the downfall of Detroit.  That wasn't a Democratic policy.WEBB:  Let me get the facts behind this.(CROSSTALK)GUSTER:  You all are trying to shift it...(CROSSTALK)WEBB:  I deal in facts.  The facts...GUSTER:  That is a fact!WEBB:  ... behind Detroit...GUSTER:  So let's talk about it.WEBB:  The facts -- yes, I will, if you'll let me.  The facts behind Detroit is it was predictable failure with the growth of union labor rates, the cost that auto manufacturers could not maintain, the fact that...(CROSSTALK)WEBB:  Where did this come from, to your point?  It came from the liberal alignment with a lot of these unions...CARLSON:  That is all true.WEBB:  ... that cost the jobs.(CROSSTALK)CARLSON:  But the bottom line is you can't look at Detroit or Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or Cleveland and say, You know what?  good job, Democratic leadership.But let me ask you that.  So (INAUDIBLE) why does Hillary Clinton think she has an absolute moral claim on all black votes?  And she does, and she's basically said that.  It turns out Hillary Clinton is from the Mississippi Delta.  She grew up poor there.  How do I know that?  You thought she was from suburban Chicago?  No.  Listen to her talk, and you'll know her roots. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  I don't feel no ways tired.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  I come too far from where I started from.  Nobody told me that the road would be easy!Now, let me tell you I'm aware I may not be the youngest candidate in this race, but I have one big advantage.  I've been coloring my hair for years!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  Now, I'm sure there's more patronizing tape we could find, but I can't imagine what it would look like.  That is the single most patronizing, awkward thing I've ever seen!GUSTER:  I doubt if you'll find more because those are the only two clips that are being shown.CARLSON:  But they're unbelievable!GUSTER:  But that was...CARLSON:  If Trump had talked that way, I wouldn't defend it!  (INAUDIBLE) that's nauseating!GUSTER:  Well, that's not a good tape.  That's a bad clip.(LAUGHTER)GUSTER:  I'll give you that.  I'll give you that.(CROSSTALK)GUSTER:  I always shoot straight.  But when you -- we're talking about two candidates, where Trump has 43 percent of white people think he's a racist. That is a problem for him.  So if 43 percent of white people think you're racist, you have a...(CROSSTALK)CARLSON:  ... doesn't mean you are racist.(CROSSTALK)CARLSON:  ... debating the core issues, I think.WEBB:  Let's get back to the core issue of what we're here to talk about.(CROSSTALK)WEBB:  Eric, I'd love to spend time on this election (ph), but I want to go to the issue here, which is the black community.  We have gone from a community back in the days of Civil Rights that had strong family structure, a growing middle class, fastest-growing middle class in the early '90s because of college graduation with black males.We have gone to a community that has got a higher unemployment rate, a lower education rate, and the young millennials...(CROSSTALK)WEBB:  No, let me finish.GUSTER:  I'm asking you.WEBB:  Stop interrupting my point...(CROSSTALK)WEBB:  When all those factors and more combine, you have failure in a community.  And what Donald Trump is saying, shouldn't you consider another choice?  And it's this simple reason.  Blacks have given their unyielding support to the Democrats for 50 years, and there's a split.  It's not a monolithic block, but look at the urban blacks and where they are economically (INAUDIBLE)CARLSON:  I want to ask you one last question, and it's this.  When you listen to Hillary talk and you listen to Obama talk, I'm listening to you, and you really get the impression that the Democrats believe the single biggest impediment to success in the inner city is white racism from conservatives.  Do you believe that?  Do you really believe that?GUSTER:  No, that's not the single largest impediment.CARLSON:  What is?  What is the single biggest impediment?GUSTER:  Proper funding for education, among other issues, job creation...(CROSSTALK)GUSTER:  But let me finish.  In reference to Trump versus Hillary, Hillary wasn't my first choice.  But looking at Trump versus Hillary, she is clearly the choice in this race.WEBB:  Can we just use the point Eric Guster made, which is completely wrong?  The cost of education, which I have been reporting on for years now, has increased to some averages of $24,000 to $28,000 per student in these urban environments where...(CROSSTALK)WEBB:  Let me finish.  Let me finish -- where the money going into the education system has not been applied to education but the growth of the administration.CARLSON:  There's clearly not a direct correlation between the amount we spend and the results.  It's not that simple, obviously.GUSTER:  One last point.  This was the election that the GOP could have attracted the black vote, but Trump is definitely not the candidate (INAUDIBLE)CARLSON:  Look, anyone who runs is going to be racist because he has to be!(CROSSTALK)CARLSON:  They have to call you a racist, period.GUSTER:  On my radio show, I've encouraged people to split their ticket for years.  Trump is not the candidate to do that.CARLSON:  But that's why you're sitting here because you're a beacon reasonableness in a sea of nuttiness.  But I mean, like, it's true...(CROSSTALK)WEBB:  Let me say this to the black community.  Stop giving away your political power to any party, and in this case, the Democrats, because they have nothing to gain and nothing they want but your vote.(CROSSTALK)CARLSON:  All right, gentlemen, I'm being told that we're out of time.WEBB:  Don't vote for the liar, Hillary Clinton.CARLSON:  Thank you.GUSTER:  And Mr. Trump.CARLSON:  Coming up next right here on the ""Hannity"" TV show...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We will build a great wall along the southern border, and Mexico will pay for the wall.  (END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  He's going to build a wall.  You can hear ""Morning Joe"" scoffing, but it turns out people kind of want a wall actually.  How does his plan compare to Hillary Clinton's?  She's against a wall, except when it's around the White House.  We're going to break down her plan coming up next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Secretary Clinton, any comment on your husband --(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  She's not really in the mood to answer questions.  She hasn't really been in the mood for 273 days because she's just busy.  According to a new report, Clinton will begin letting members of the press fly on her campaign plane.  They are going to be so grateful.  The question is will they be given access?  Do they need access?  Will it affect their continuous suck-up to Hillary Clinton?  It's nauseating and we're going to chronicle it in excruciating detail here on the ""Hannity"" program.  Stay tuned.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON:  Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Donald Trump delivered a major immigration policy speech earlier this week in Phoenix.  Here's some of the highlights in case you missed it.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We will build a great wall along the southern border, and Mexico will pay for the wall.  (APPLAUSE)TRUMP:  We are going to suspend the issuance of visas to anyplace where adequate screening cannot occur.  Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation taskforce focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice, just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?  (APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  So the speech went on for over an hour, but the core promise was this.  Trump said he's going to put Americans first with his immigration policy.  He's not going to do anything except to the extent it benefits Americans.  Does Hillary have the same guiding spirit in her immigration plan?  Here to tell us, American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp, psychology expert and radio host Dr. Gina Loudon, and Democratic strategist Dr. Jessica Tarlov.  She's not actually a doctor, but for the purposes of tonight's show.  Oh, you are a doctor?JESSICA TARLOV, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER AND STRATEGIST:  It's a little fake, but it's a thing.CARLSON:  Good enough for cable.  (LAUGHTER)CARLSON:  So here's my question to you, Jessica Tarlov.  So Trump said I'm putting Americans first.  I've heard Hillary Clinton say an awful lot about immigration.  I sat through the entire Democratic convention in Philadelphia.  I didn't hear her say one thing, not one thing ever about the effects of immigration, legal or illegal, on American citizens, people who live here.  Why?  TARLOV:  Well, it's a different focus of the message.  Obviously the core of her plan is that there's a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now, which actually seems like it's Donald Trump's plan as well if you look at what he said the morning after his speech.  He's waffling a bit at this.  CARLSON:  It's certainly not the core of his plan or his main concern.  The main concern of ""Morning Joe,"" but --TARLOV:  He didn't say it to ""Morning Joe.""  Yes, amnesty is ""Morning Joe's"" thing, but the truth of the matter is that what he said on Wednesday night is not what he said on Thursday morning, which is a problem.  We still don't know what his speech is.  But what Hillary Clinton talks about is American exceptionalism, she talks about what America is founded on, which is being a melting pot of people from all over the world.  Her core argument is that immigrants make us better as a nation.  They're not here just to take our jobs, to kill our children.  CARLSON:  OK, but that's a bumper sticker, not a policy.  It's a nice spirit.  I mean, I like immigrants.  Every American, I mean it, does like immigrants.  They work super hard.  They're really nice.  I think most of them are great, actually.  But doesn't a president have to take into account the effects of immigration on people who were born here, who live here, who are American citizens?  I don't get a sense Hillary Clinton cares at all, and if she does, I'll stand corrected, but show me the evidence.  MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Look, it's all politics, right?  She was against illegals getting drive licenses, and now she's for it.  She's not criticizing Barack Obama for actually aggressively, more aggressively than at the beginning of his administration, deporting illegal aliens, you know, taking on her own president.  She voted for a fence, what she calls a fence, not a wall.  I don't know whether it's a wall or a fence, Tucker, or just a barrier.  But she voted for that when she thought it was good for her politically.  She's all over the map.  But it comes down to this.  At the end of the day for Hillary Clinton, she's going to do or say anything to the left flank of her party in order to have the cohesion she needs to keep the Bernie Sanders and hopefully the Jill Stein people at bay.  And at the end of the day, Donald Trump has this right, which is when 75 percent of the American public thinks -- and that's Democrats and Republicans by the way -- thinks we're on the wrong track, and when our economy is as weak and soft as it is where people haven't seen increases in their take-home pay, it's right to put American citizens first.  CARLSON:  I want to get Gina Loudon in here.  So, Gina, last year, 2015, fully one-half of all driver licenses issued in the state of California went to illegal aliens.  Hillary Clinton supports that.  Why would she support that?  It seems pretty clear that Democrats are intent on erasing the distinction between citizen and non-citizen in the expectation that non-citizens will vote.  I mean there's a political --TARLOV:  There's no evidence of that.  CARLSON:  Really?  TARLOV:  That illegals are voting?  CARLSON:  Gina, let me ask you this.  Why wouldn't they vote in states with no requirement for I.D., why wouldn't illegal aliens vote?  DR. GINA LOUDON, PSYCHOLOGY EXPERT AND RADIO HOST:  Of course they vote, and that honestly is my biggest fear about the next election.  It isn't that Mr. Trump will lose.  Tucker, I live right on the Mexican border, and I can tell you my friends and neighbors by and large, Hispanic immigrants will be voting for Mr. Trump because they don't like what's happening in their own neighborhoods.  I love Jessica, but I cannot understand how anyone can sit there with a straight face and defend what Hillary is proposing.  She's essentially saying, hey, Jessica, tonight when you go to bed, leave your doors open, set a pot of cash out on your sidewalk because that's what she wants us to do with our country.  Most Americans can see right through this.  They know it's all about votes, Tucker, and that's why they like Mr. Trump's plan, that is actually a plan.  TARLOV:  Well, they don't like Trump's plan.  CARLSON:  Gina, you're game to answer any question.  I ask you sincerely, Hillary Clinton is saying my campaign is about wages, middle class wages. How can you simultaneously say that and encourage a continuation of a massive importation of low-end labor into the labor pool which depresses wages?  TARLOV:  Well, we have a net outflow of immigrants from Mexico.  CARLSON:  No.  TARLOV:  Yes we do.  CARLSON:  From Mexico, but not net.  We are approaching the highest levels of foreign born people in this country we've ever had ever.  You can't look me in the eye and tells any that raises wages.  It does the opposite.  TARLOV:  We've talked about this.  CARLSON:  So how can she say both?  TARLOV:  Her main argument is about these 11 million people who are here. Yes, there's a visa program, but it's about the 11 million, the good people who Donald Trump talks about, have been here 20, 30, 40 years working for their families.  And that's the point about the direction of the country, 75 percent wrong track, that's a little bit high.  But what about the 65 percent that favor a pathway to citizenship?  Over 50 percent of the GOP is now behind it, 77 percent for legalization.  CARLSON:  What about Americans, Matt?  TARLOV:  What's so bad about your life?CARLSON:  Whatever the number is of illegals in this country, I'm sure a lot of them are really nice people.  TARLOV:  It's 11 million.  CARLSON:  We don't know that.  That's not a real number.  TARLOV:  It is a --CARLSON:  It's a census number.  We don't know what the number is.  Here's the point.  What about the effect on Americans?  Whatever Trump's faults, he's the only person I've ever heard ask that question.  SCHLAPP:  They talk about the fact we're having illegal Mexican immigrants go back to Mexico.  Even they're indicting the Obama economy.  Even they can't find what they need with the wages they've been able to get in the past.  CARLSON:  That's a hilarious point.  (CROSSTALK)SCHLAPP:  Let me try here.  Let me try.  The fact is that putting America first, people say it's racist.  They say it's nativist.  No, it's not.  It just makes sense.  By the way, it's connecting to people, be they Republican, Democrat, independent, whatever they are.  They're like, why shouldn't I be first?  CARLSON:  That's a great question.  Gina Loudon, we're almost out of time. Just sum it up for me, would you.  LOUDON:  Tucker, when you put all the noise aside, all Americans care about in this election is being able to provide for their families and to be able to keep them safe.  Mr. Trump's ten-point plan addresses that.  Hillary hasn't even addressed the debt, her incompetence as secretary of state or any of the mistakes she's made so far.  CARLSON:  She's going to do that in her next press conference, so stay tuned.  Gina, Matt, Dr. Tarlov, it's great to see you all.  Coming up next, there is still more on the ""Hannity,"" program, including this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Secretary Clinton, any comment on your --CLINTON:  You'll love this.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Secretary Clinton, any comment on your husband leaving --(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  She's got no comment.  She's not interested in talking to you. But that hasn't diminished the love that the press brings to Hillary Clinton.  They're in awe of her.  She's a great person.  Will they ever get to ask a question, though?  That is the meta-question, and we're going to have reaction to that and more as ""Hannity"" continues.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON:  Welcome back to ""Hannity.""  It has been, and we are counting here, 273 days since Hillary Clinton last held a legitimate press conference. After pressure from the press, ABC News is reporting that Clinton will start using a larger campaign plane to allow the press to travel with her. The question is, will she let them up front to ask questions, or will she treat them like this?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Secretary Clinton, any comment on your --CLINTON:  You'll love this.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Secretary Clinton, any comment on your husband leaving --CLINTON:  Everybody try one.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Secretary Clinton, should your campaign have known that Omar Mateen's father was at your campaign rally yesterday?  Secretary Clinton, a few questions?  CLINTON:  Thank you all very much.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- that the Clinton cabinet was a distraction.  Can you comment on the specific allegations, though?  (END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON:  As in a bad marriage, she's not even hearing them.  She stopped listening.  What, were you talking?  Joining us now, two of our old friends, Lee Carter, she's the famous pollster, and Fox News contributor and political legend, Pat Caddell. Great to see you both.  Pat, to you, this is a middle finger in the face of the press obviously, and yet they continue to love her, to worship her to carry her water, to lick her boots.  Is there anything Hillary Clinton could do, could she spit in the face of a New York Times reporter, is there anything she can do, could you murder one of them to have them turn against her?  PAT CADDELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  No.  I think they'd have a festival if she did.  No.  This is in my lifetime the greatest bias I have ever seen, the jihad, I call it.  I have never seen anything like it.  And here is the problem with it.  What's happening when they're not calling her out on it, and she's smart not to do it, I guess, politically, although now I believe it will start working against her badly because of the stories that are coming out.  But she is doing this in a way that is so contemptuous of the American people.  And the press behavior, see, I think politicians shouldn't complain about the press, lying about the press.  What they should be discussing is the institutional abuse of an institution whose job it is to protect the American people from power, not to get in bed and promote power.  CARLSON:  That's exactly it.  I'm so glad you said that.  They are working on behalf of the establishment, which is not what they're supposed to be doing.  Lee Carter, I get the strategy, and I think Hillary's hide strategy works if the campaign is all about Donald Trump's personality.  She doesn't want to get involved in that.  It helps her.  But if the campaign is about issues like immigration, for example, or trade, does it help her to hide?  LEE CARTER, POLLSTER:  It doesn't help her to hide.  I think she's taking a strategist right now where she feels the best thing to do is ride it out, put her head down and not really say anything except to try to use Donald Trump's words against him.The problem is that it's way too long.  We've got 70 or 80 days until the election.  This is too long for her to just ride it out.  And People are seeing through what she's trying to do.  When we see this, it's just to invite the press in, and it doesn't seem authentic.  People are calling her out on it and saying this isn't authentic.  This isn't real.  And she doesn't really open herself up, then people are going to say we see you're being calculated.  And a lot of the decisions that are made about the election this year are all about authenticity and can I relate to you, can I trust.  And I think people are really having a hard time with Hillary Clinton.  CARLSON:  So this campaign is going to end, Pat, and as you just wisely noted the press has decided to defend entrenched power.  They're on the side of Hillary Clinton and the hedge fund managers against middle America.  CADDELL:  The American people understand that.  CARLSON:  They do.  And that raises the question, what is going to happen when this ends, when the election is over?  We will be credibly covering the government after this?  CADDELL:  They won't be credibly covering it any more than they credibly covered the last four years.  You know, this is frightening.  Barack Obama ironically doesn't like the press, despises them.  And yet they have protected him on more things.  No president ever had lapdogs like them in the modern era.  You know, it is when John Kennedy had a friendly press corps, he had very negative editors.  He had very hostile editors and many columnists, if you want to take an example of someone who was a darling of the press.This is different though.  This is from top to bottom.  And their decision, what is going to happen with her, I believe, is when all of the revelations like today's, which is criminal behavior in my opinion of the highest sort while people that your raised earlier in the program are in jail for doing much less.  The -- what she's doing is she's thumbing her nose not at the press but at the American people.  And when they get that point, if that point starts being made, and the press comes under what I call institutional attack, they should be, they will panic to cover.  CARLSON:  I hope so.  Lee, I'm sorry to get to back.  I will see you on ""Fox & Friends."" You're our favorite guest.  CARTER:  Yes.  Great to see you.  CARLSON:  Thank you.  Thanks, Pat.  Coming back, we will be back after the break.  There is a lot more, so stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON:  Welcome back to the ""Hannity"" program.  Unfortunately, and I mean that, it is unfortunate, we are out of time.  Don't forget to set your alarm.  I'll be on ""Fox & Friends"" in just a few hours, 6:00 a.m. eastern.  Have the best Labor Day weekend and a great night.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
