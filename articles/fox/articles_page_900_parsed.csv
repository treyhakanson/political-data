Sessions on Trump's response to Orlando	"This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" June 19, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.In the wake of the Orlando massacre, a renewed debate over how to protect the homeland.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SEN. CHRIS MURPHY, D-CONNECTICUT: This Congress has mastered absolutely no response to mass shooting after mass shooting.  SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS:  You don't defeat terrorism by taking away our guns.  You defeat terrorism by using our guns.  WALLACE:  Today, Attorney General Loretta Lynch on the president's push for tougher gun control, the threat from ISIS and the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mails.  Then, on the trail.  Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton square off over terrorism.  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  It's going happen gain and again and again because we're not doing what we have to be doing.  HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  A ban on Muslims would not have stopped the attack.  Neither would a wall.  WALLACE:  We'll talk with top Trump supporter, Senator Jeff Sessions, about Trump's controversial response to Orlando and his strategy to defeat Clinton.  Plus, Trump's relations with the GOP go downhill.  REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  He is a different kind of candidate.  WALLACE:  As Trump slides in the polls, we'll ask our Sunday panel if he can win while fighting his own party.  And our power player of the week, putting a fresh face on the people who built this country.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A nation defines itself by the people who have created our history.  WALLACE:  All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday"".  (END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Hello again and happy Father's Day from Fox News in Washington.  As the country mourns the victims of the Orlando massacre, the debate has intensified over how to prevent it from happening again.  In a moment, we'll discuss the terror threat and guns with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and later with a key Trump adviser, Senator Jeff Sessions.  But, first, FOX News correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest from Orlando -- Peter.  PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, this morning at 2:02, exactly one week to the minute after the first shots rang out here on Orange Avenue, church bells in town rang 49 times, once for every victim.  And last night, the Orlando City Major League soccer club stopped playing for 49 minutes for a moment of silence, also leaving 49 seats in the stands empty.  Meanwhile, the nightclub turned crime scene is still sealed off here in Orlando, and investigators aren't providing many updates as they trace terrorist Omar Mateen's path to Pulse.  But one victim now tells the Tribune News Service he remembers seeing Mateen laying among his dead and injured victims inside to hide from the police outside.  On Friday, the FBI interviewed a man at Omar Mateen's mosque and a doctor listed as giving Mateen the psychological exam nearly a decade ago that he needed to carry a gun at his security job for the company G4S once known as Wackenhut now says her name shouldn't be in those records.  Dr. Carol Nudelman Blumberg says, quote, ""What I do know is that in September of 2007, I was not living or working in Florida.  I was not performing any work for Wackenhut and I did not administer any type of examination to Omar Mateen.""The community is coming together to honor the dead as funerals continued today.  Yesterday's service for Cory James Connell, a 21-year-old who wanted to be a firefighter but will never get a chance, Orange County fire rescue made him an honorary member of their department.  There are dozens of heartbreaking stories like Cory's here in Central Florida.  Meanwhile, 19 victims remain hospitalized at Orlando Regional Medical Center with gunshot wounds -- Chris.  WALLACE:  Peter Doocy reporting from Orlando -- Peter, thanks for that.  Joining me now, the nation's top law enforcement officer, Attorney General Loretta Lynch.  Welcome to ""Fox News Sunday.""  LORETTA LYNCH, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES:  Good morning, Chris.  WALLACE:  Why isn't the wife of the Orlando shooter in jail?  We know that she went on some of these scouting trips with Omar Mateen.  She knew that he bought guns and that he was planning an attack.  Why not charge her?  LYNCH:  Well, where we are now is in the middle of a very aggressive investigation.  And yes, we are talking to everyone who had contact with this killer and that, of course, includes the family members.  We want to know what they know, what they saw, and what he said to them.  The investigation is ongoing.  We don't have any announcements to make about other individuals at this time, but we are trying to recreate the days, the weeks, the months of this killer's life before this attack.  And we're also asking people who had contact with him to come forward and give us that information as well.  WALLACE:  Now, I know that you are going to Orlando yourself on Tuesday and that tomorrow, the government will release transcripts of all contacts between the FBI and Mateen when he was on the terror watch list.  Any sense at this point that the government made a mistake when it first put him and then took him off the terror watch list?  LYNCH:  Well, I am going to Orlando on Tuesday and I'll be meeting with the team on the ground, as well as the victims and first responders, and meeting with this brave community, this LGBT community, and Latino community that was targeted in this terrible act of hate and terror.What we are releasing tomorrow are actually the transcripts of the phone contact between the killer and the Orlando negotiators the night of the attacks.  So, it will be a partial transcript of those calls.  We're trying to get information out.  It's our goal to be as transparent as possible in this investigation.  With respect to the prior contact that we had with him, we're going go back and looking at that as well.  We're going to go back and look at everything we did in connection with him and be as transparent as possible about how it evolved, what developed and what changes we could have made.  WALLACE:  The Senate is set to vote on Sunday on some gun control measures.  Under a Republican plan, if someone who's on a terror watch-list wants to buy a gun, the government would have three days, the sale would be halted, the government would have three days to prove probable cause to a judge.  Why isn't that reasonable?  LYNCH:  Well, what we've been looking at is the plan that currently would give the Department of Justice two very important tools.  First, the ability to in fact stop a sale if someone is on the watch list, but second and more importantly, if there is litigation about that because, of course, people would have the right to challenge that, it does cover constitutional rights.  It gives us the ability to set the procedures in place that let us protect sensitive and classified information in the adjudication of an appeal.  Those two issues are very, very important to us.  And that's why we're supporting the amendment that contains those two important issues.  WALLACE:  What about the 72-hour deadline that you have to prove probable cause in 72 hours or the gun sale goes through?  LYNCH:  Well, what we think is more appropriate is the one that gives us the most flexibility, the ability to stop that sale at the beginning, and the ability, again, if it's challenged to protect sensitive and classified information.  Those are the concerns that law enforcement has had some time about how to manage this very, very difficult and important issue.  WALLACE:  But you know what the critics say.  They say that that means if you have maximum flexibility, that government will take weeks or months.  The terror watch list has 800,000 names on it, and you know that some of them names are on there mistakenly.  If you're going to take away someone's constitutional right, don't you have to give them due process and don't you have to give them prompt due process?  LYNCH:  Well, you have to give them both.  And we feel that the amendment that gives us those two important tools lets us do that.  In addition to providing due process, as you know that whenever constitutional right is implicated that has to be built into it, we have a very strong law enforcement interest in protecting the types of investigations that, in fact, put people on the watch list or that maybe around those individuals.  And so, it's very important to us that we have the ability to conduct this in a way that lets us protect that information.  WALLACE:  But is 72 hours too short a time?  LYNCH:  Well, we think that having enough flexibility is the best way to achieve that.  It lets us determine whether or not the sale should proceed first of all.  We may be able to look at a person and make a determination even faster than that or we may not.  We may, in fact, need more time.  And I think the American people deserve us to take the greatest amount of time and scrutiny that we can in the important decision of whether or not someone who's been implicated on this matter should, in fact, be able to buy a firearm.  But, of course, there has to be a redress.  There has to be a way for people to challenge it, and we do want that, but we also in the course of that need to be able to protect sensitive and classified information.  WALLACE:  On Monday, the day after the attack, Donald Trump said this:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  When I'm elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there's a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  The next day you said this, ""We have to push back on the voices that prey on fear and that sow division.""Attorney General Lynch, were you talking about Donald Trump?  LYNCH:  I was not talking about Mr. Trump or any specific person, but I was talking about the climate of fear that comes about after these terrorist attacks that often leads people to react without thinking and to react in fear and sadly allows them to take the law into their own hands and try, in fact, and go out and target other individuals.  I was talking about that climate that we have seen after so many of these attacks.  WALLACE:  Do you think that Donald Trump contributes to that climate?  LYNCH:  You know, I don't have a comment on Mr. Trump or any of the candidates.  I think we have to keep our eye on a larger picture here, which is the victims of this crime were from a community that is often marginalized and that frankly the LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group.  That comes from a wide variety of sources.  We have to push back against those voices that are speaking out now that are not supportive of that community.  (CROSSTALK)LYNCH:  And we have to make sure that this country stays open and free and inclusive for everyone.WALLACE,:  But I guess the question is, is this to be viewed, and not to say it's one or the other, as primarily a hate crime or as a terror attack?  Also this week, the CIA Director John Brennan said that ISIS is now focused on launching attacks outside the Middle East.  Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR:  The group is exploring a variety of means for infiltrating operatives into the West, including in refugee flows, smuggling routes and legitimate methods of travel.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Given that, is it unreasonable for Donald Trump to say stop, at least temporarily ban refugees from coming into this country?  LYNCH:  Let me go to your first point, which is, what are we talking about when we talk about this terrible attack in Orlando?  And as the president has said, it is both an act on terror and an act of hate.  Clearly, this is an individual who is inspired by terrorist ideology, but it was an attack that was directed against the LGBT community and the Latino community.  We are trying to find out his motivations.  We're trying to find out everything we can about what lead him to this path, what put him in the night club that morning with that firearm.  Now, one of the things that we have talked about before is our concern about homegrown extremists -- individuals who consumed this radical violent ideology and then act on it.  And, of course, what we're working on is making sure that our investigations pick up those individuals and also gather as much information that we can from the people who know them, from citizens who are concerned so that we can, in fact, intervene before this kind of tragedy happens gain.  WALLACE:  I want to talk about one other subject with you.  President Obama recently endorsed Hillary Clinton for president.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I'm with her.  I am fired up, and I cannot wait to get out there and campaign for Hillary.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Now, you're a political appointee of the president.  Does that create a conflict of interest for you?  Does that make it harder for you to handle the criminal investigation into Clinton when your boss is saying he thinks she should be president?  LYNCH:  Well, you know, I don't get involved on whom the president endorses and I don't have comments, as I said before, on any of the candidates.  The investigation into the State Department e-mail matter is going to be handled like any other matter.  We've got career agents and lawyers looking at that.  They will follow the facts and follow the evidence wherever it leads and come to a conclusion.  WALLACE:  So, does this create a conflict of interest for you?  LYNCH:  No, this is not a conflict for me and for the department or for anyone.  We will continue to do all of our work in the same language we always have, with the interest of the American people first and foremost.  WALLACE:  Now, the same day that Clinton was endorsed by the president, you met with the president at the White House.  Did you in any way, shape or form discuss the Clinton case with the president?  LYNCH:  We've never discussed the Clinton case.  I have never spoken about it with the president or really with anyone at the White House.  That's not the kind of relationship that I have with people there and it would be inappropriate to do so.  WALLACE:  Attorney General Lynch, thank you.  Thanks for your time today.LYNCH:  Thank you, Chris.WALLACE:  Pleasure to talk with you.  Please come back.  LYNCH:  Thank you.  WALLACE:  Up next, Senator Jeff Sessions, a key policy adviser to Trump on his candidate's call for President Obama to resign and Trump's plan to talk with the NRA about gun control.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A look at the growing memorial in Orlando, Florida, with the 49 people who were killed in last Sunday's massacre.  After that terror attack at the night club, Donald Trump doubled down on his plan to ban foreign Muslims from the U.S.  And he called on President Obama to resign.  Joining me now is the chair of Trump's national security advisory committee, Senator Jeff Sessions.And, Senator, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday"".  SEN. JEFF SESSIONS, R-ALABAMA:  Chris, good to be with you.  WALLACE:  You just heard Attorney General Lynch defend the administration's position on and policies on protecting the homeland.  Your reaction?  SESSIONS:  Well, I think it's still -- the whole administrative agenda is out of touch with the reality.  We have a very toxic extremist group within Islam that is attacking the United States.  We have convicted or charged 580 people since 9/11, almost all Islamic terrorist threats.  This is a real threat to America.  We need to do much more to defend ourselves against it.President Obama won't even call the name of the threat.  So, that's the kind of thing that if he is not going to leave, not going to be able to be a force for protecting our security, maybe he should step aside.  I think that's what Trump was saying.  WALLACE:  You're not really serious, are you?  SESSIONS:  No, you know, he doesn't mean he is going to resign or step aside, but the point is, this kind of rhetorical phrasing, you either get in and lead or get out of the way.  WALLACE:  All right.  I want to get to some of those other issues in a moment.  But I want to begin by drilling down on the guns.  On Wednesday, Trump tweeted this, put it up on the screen.  ""I will be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list or the no fly list to buy guns.""Senator, do you support your candidate on that?  SESSIONS:  Yes, I think that it's great to talk with the NRA and see if we can work out the language on this.  We're so close on this issue.  It ought to be able to be fixed easily.  The problem is the Democratic colleagues are pushing this to try to create an impression that guns were the responsible cause of this attack in Orlando, when it's really a toxic ideology.  That's what caused it.  That's what seduced this man into doing this kind of thing.  And we can tighten up the law some, it won't make a big difference in my opinion in securing America's safety.  But we -- people on the terrorist watch list, I believe, should be denied the right to bear -- get a gun, but they should have a chance to protest that they're wrongfully on the list.  I think that's fair and we should be able to reach language among the --  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Well, let's talk about that, because that's what I went through with Attorney General Lynch a couple of moments ago.  The Cornyn Amendment, the plan that the Republicans are putting, says you get 72 hours to give probable cause, prove that, satisfy a judge; Democrats and you could hear Attorney General Lynch basically saying, no, we may need longer than that.  Trump said again yesterday, no one on the terror watch list should be able to buy a gun.  He didn't say anything about delaying, you know, for a certain period of time for probable cause.  He said, I'd like to see that.  It's just simpler.Are you saying that you support Trump on that?  SESSIONS:  Well, I don't think Trump is saying he never let somebody get off the list if they were wrongfully put on it.  So, I think that's probably a misquote.  But Attorney General Lynch said was pretty close to where I'm comfortable be.  You have a delay.  You have a chance for the Department of Justice to prove this person shouldn't be able to execute a constitutional right and you shouldn't have to reveal too much of your internal data that could be compromised our intelligence sources in the process.  I think something like that could be worked out.  I think Trump is trying to be a positive force.  WALLACE: How leaders react after a tragedy like the Orlando massacre gives people an insight into what kind of a leader or what kind of a potential president they would be.  And I want to ask you about some of the things that Donald Trump has done in the last week, Senator.  First, his comments the day after the tragedy that seemed to imply that President Obama is sympathetic to the terrorists.  Here he is.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)TRUMP:  He doesn't get it, or he gets it better than anybody understands.  It's one or the other, and either one is unacceptable.  We're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart or he's got something else in mind.  (END AUDIO CLIP)WALLACE:  Question: Do you know what that something else Trump refers to that he thinks that President Obama has in mind?  SESSIONS:  No, I don't.  I don't know what he was referring to there.  But I do believe he is correct to raise the question that the policies of this administration, from going back to 2011 when we withdrew all our troops from Iraq and allowed ISIS to form and become an entity probably would never have happened otherwise.  Certainly, not spread as much as it has.So, I think he --  WALLACE:  Forgive me.  I just want to go through what Trump said.  He said, ""Either he doesn't get it or he gets it better than anyone understands, he's got something else in mind.""I mean, that certainly seems to imply that he is sympathetic to radical Islam.  SESSIONS:  No, I don't think that he means that, but I think he's going -- I think he is criticizing him, President Obama, for going too far, for not understanding the threat.  The president and Clinton now say she wants to go from 10,000 Syrian refugees to 65,000 Syrian refugees, when Mr. Brennan, CIA director, says we can't do vetting on that, when we know that right now, a team from the European leader are heading to Europe to attack Europe from Syria.  So, we can't vet these people because we don't have any background on them.  There's no way to go into their communities and check their records, their arrest records or their business records.  All you have is what they tell you.  And we know, as the CIA director said, refugees provide an opportunity to enter the United States and create attacks.  WALLACE:  Then, Trump said, and we kind of touch on this before, that President Obama should resign and Hillary Clinton should drop out of the race because of their refusal or failure to say the phrase ""radical Islam.""  Here is how the president responded to that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA:  There's no magic to the phrase ""radical Islam."" It's a political talking point.  It's not a strategy.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Now, I understand the argument you can't beat the enemy unless you identify the enemy and clearly, there is an Islamist jihadist component in this. But I think would you agree with the president that even if you say the names, that the real key is, what's your plan, what's your strategy to beat ISIS?  SESSIONS:  Well, I don't understand the president's view on this at all.  I think it's totally inexplicable.And when Donald Trump went directly at Hillary Clinton on this, for the first time, she said the words ""Islamic extremism"" or something to that affect, because she has taken an indefensible position.  Of course, that's what it is, you know?  Of course, this is what the threat is.  It is out there.  It is growing and CIA director indicated it looks like it will continue to grow.  Even though we can have some battlefield victories against ISIS, the threat is still expanding.  WALLACE:  Then, Trump upset some veterans by accusing American soldiers of stealing some of the millions of dollars that the U.S. was supplying to help with reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Here is Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I want to know who are the soldiers that had the job because I think they're living well right now, whoever they may be.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Now, the Trump campaign said that they were talking about the Iraq soldiers.  But, Senator, he talked about the same thing last September and it was clearer then that he was talking about U.S. soldiers with millions of dollars that they were handing out for reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  SESSIONS:  Well, we put a huge amount of money in Iraq and Afghanistan, so much of it was wasted and abused and used corruptly.  It's just no doubt about it.  WALLACE:  Do you think that U.S. soldiers were stealing it?  SESSIONS:  No, not in general.  But we -- some were convicted.  Some U.S. people have been convicted of offenses dealing directly with the abuse of that money.  So, I think we do have a big problem with our allies, with soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.  And a lot of the money has been poor spent, and we need a tough leader to tighten it up.  We don't have any money to waste on corruption.  WALLACE:  Let's turn to the state of relation between Trump and his own party, GOP leaders.  Here is some of what they had to say about Trump this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., MAJORITY LEADER:  I was asked about every incident last week.  I've already said I disapprove of them time and time and time again.  REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  He is a different kind of candidate.  This is a different time of the year.  I'm going to be myself and speak up in defense of our principles.  (END VIDEO CLIPS)WALLACE:  Now, Trump said after that they should, quote, ""be quiet"" and that he might run alone.  Can Trump run aside, apart, alone from the Republican Party without all of the infrastructure and the field organization, the database, the fundraising operation that they have and that he doesn't have?  SESSIONS:  Well, I think that we're going to get the unity.  Trump has met with the leaders.WALLACE:  When?SESSIONS:  Well, he's met with people repeatedly.  He has talked with Congressman Ryan, he's talked to Senator McConnell on the phone, in addition to those personal meetings.  He's been reaching out to them.But let me give advice to my Republican colleagues.  They need to look at the election returns.  They need to understand that the American people are not happy with the gridlock in America.  They're not happy their wages have fallen since 2000 instead steadily.  They're not happy that we have a high unemployment.  They're not happy that we have an open border and lawlessness at our border.  They believe we should have a lawful system of immigration.  It serves their interests.They don't believe these trade deals have worked with them.  So I think -- for them.  So, I think our leaders on both sides need to be considering what the American people are saying in this election and they need to be a part of the unity, too.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Meaning get on the Trump train?  SESSIONS:  They need to be participating in assisting some of these things.  We haven't been effective in fixing illegal immigration, the trade deal, we've got a lot of votes and support in the Congress, on the Democrats and Republicans.  So, I think there's a lot of things we need to learn from the American people.  WALLACE:  Let's look at the polls and talking about the American people.  On May 23rd, after Trump wrapped up the nomination, the Real Clear Politics average had him tied with Clinton.  But now, he is trailing by six points, and in some polls, by double digits.  Senator, with all of the controversies of the last month, especially going after the judge and the Trump University case, hasn't Trump squandered the last few weeks?  SESSIONS:  Well, I don't think he squandered it, but it's been a difficult time.  People want the vote for him.  He is correct on the issues, and I think tone can improve over time.  But I would just say, I remember former President Bush Sr. was down 15 points at the time of convention, in August, and then won with a huge victory.  So I just think this is premature.But I would say to you the issue on what is going to work and what will work for Donald Trump -- trade, immigration, wages, jobs, gridlock in Washington.  He is going break that up and move us in the right direction.  And I believe the numbers are going to move his way steadily as these issues are joined in the fall.  WALLACE:  Final questions.  Some delegates to the Republican convention are now talking about trying to change the rules in Cleveland to make it that no delegates are legally bound and that they could nominate someone other than Donald Trump.  How seriously do you take that?  SESSIONS:  I don't take it seriously at all.  I hear somebody says as many as 30.  Well, there are 2,400 delegates.  Trump has swept this election.  He had the biggest percentage -- biggest number of votes ever in the Republican primary.  He drew in more votes than the Democrats.  The Republican primaries has cast 2 million more votes than the Democrats.  He drew independents, he drew Democrats into the Republican primary.  That's a historic thing.WALLACE:  Senator Sessions, thank you.  Thanks for coming in today.  Always good to talk to you, sir.  SESSIONS:  Thank you, Chris.WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss after Orlando how to protect the homeland.  Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Obama's focus on gun control as a way to stop mass shootings?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debate gun control.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: If the FBI is watching you, you should not be able to buy a gun.TRUMP: Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel how the debate in Congress will play in the 2016 race.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: This campaign at this stage is firing on all cylinders. And as a result, ISIL's under more pressure than ever before.JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: Unfortunately, despite all our progress against ISIL on the battlefield and in the financial realm, our efforts have not reduced the group's terrorism capability and global reach.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  President Obama and his CIA director with very different assessments of the threat from ISIS in the wake of the Orlando terror act.And it's time now for our Sunday group. Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Amy Walter from the Cook Political Report, syndicated columnist George Will, and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams.Well, Brit, that was a pretty stunning contradiction on Tuesday. You h ad the president talking about making significant progress against ISIS, and then the very next day you had the CIA director testifying before Congress saying, yes, we are rolling back some of their territory, yes, we are killing some of their people, but, in fact, they're a greater threat than ever to the west.BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: So, obviously, what the CIA director is saying is that this -- that this policy and practice that the administration has put into place against ISIS is not working. The threat is growing. The president would never say that. I don't -- I don't think -- I don't think Brennan's going to get fired. But you put that together with all of this argument about the use of the term, you know, radical Islamist terrorism, the refusal to use it by the administration, this is a point of vulnerable for the administration. At a moment when the president's approval rating had been rising, which is of enestible (ph) help to -- to his party's candidate, in this case Hillary Clinton. But this attack, I think, is -- is -- is for -- for the time being, anyway, a game changer on that and has thrown the administration on the defensive and the Brennan testimony hammers that home.WALLACE:  We're -- we're going to get to the political aspects of this in the next segment, but let's talk about the substance of what we do.Juan, for all the talk about immigration and gun control and we'll get to those in a moment, isn't the best way to stop the terror attacks and win the war against ISIS?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that's part of the answer. I mean clearly if you diminish the leadership, and the United States has been killing off a great number of the leader of the terror group, and you cut in terms of their territory this week we saw them push back in Fallujah, for example. So there's progress there on the battle field.The problem is that they are now relying on alternative strategies. So they're, for example, expanding their presence in places like Nigeria and Libya, so they're a bigger presence there, and, secondly, relying on social media to spread their cancerous ideology. So that's a -- that's an issue there. And they're also now saying, excuse me, that they can rely on infiltrating refugee flows and these lone wolf attacks.So this is a different set of issues. I mean you can wipe them out in term of their presence in Syria, Iraq, but the presence in Africa, the presence on social media, the threat in terms of the refuge flows, that remains, even if you beat them on the battlefield.HUME: Well, we'd like to know with the -- what would happen if they were beaten on the battlefield. And the fact is, although gains have been made, they have not been beaten. Their territory, their headquarters in Raqqa, it remains secure so far as we can tell. So the question that is raised by all of this is, how inspired would -- would Omar Mateen have been if the image of ISIS was not that of a winner whose power is growing, but of a loser whose defeat is inevitable and coming soon?WILLIAMS: Well, I think that they know that the defeat's on the way, Brit, because, in fact, what they're saying to people is, don't come into the battlefield anymore because, guess what, we're losing. Instead, engage in these lone wolf attacks.WALLACE:  Let me turn to another aspect of this, because as usual in the wake of a mass shooting, we talk about guns, George. And the debate here in Washington, as they're going to vote up in that building behind me on Monday, on four proposals on gun control, moderate Republicans Senator Susan Collins of Maine is proposing a compromise that would bar people, not on the terror watch list, which, as we say, has 800,000 people, but on two smaller, more targeted lists from buying guns. Does that make any sense and do you think there's any chance that Congress will pass it?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, here's the problem, we have a list of lists now. You've demonstrated in your questions. The attorney general -- that the watch list is cumbersome, too large to be meaningful, and doesn't have much consequence. To put someone on a Selectee List, that is you can't buy a gun if you're on the Selectee List, all that means if you're on that list, you get exposed to more rigorous examination when you try to board an airplane. Well, that --WALLACE:  You're selected out for special security--WILL: That's -- that's right. But you would -- you would be attaching to that status the loss of a Constitutional right, which we've now established under the Heller decision is the right to buy a gun. On the -- if you're on the no fly list, you've already lost a fundamental constitutional right, the right to travel. So they raise different due process questions.But when you start changing people's rights, all kinds of panoply of due process comes in and it gets complicated. Now, people are saying, no, this man in Orlando was very odd, lot of indications of instability and danger. Something should have been done. But it's not clear what that something can be, again, under a constitutional society with a rule of law.A lot of -- I think the average Americans say when they hear these proposals, how would it have prevented the most resent outrage? And it's not clear that it would have had any effect on this at all. And a lot of Americans when they -- the subject becomes assault weapons, what they describe as an assault weapon is really a machine gun, which, of course, has been banned in this country for 82 years, since 1934. That is a gun in with a single pull of the trigger will result in a constant flow of -- of -- of bullets. So there's an enormous amount of confusion, an enormous separation between the perceived dangers and the effect of any proposal we're hearing.WALLACE:  Let's bring in the panel because we asked you for questions for the panel here and we got one -- an interesting question from Marc Baker on Facebook. He writes, ""a terrorist without an AR-15 is still capable of mass murder. An AR-15 without a terrorist is not. Why does the administration choose to focus on this one variable and not the one common denominator?""Amy, how do you answer Marc? And -- and, you know, it's so interesting because on one hand you -- you had Attorney General Lynch saying, look, give due process, give them time. She's saying kind of an unlimited due process. Then you get Republicans saying, look, give them the 72 hours. Wouldn't you think there'd be the ability to find --AMY WALTER, THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT: Something in the middle?WALLACE: Something in the middle there?WALTER: Wouldn't that be amazing. And I think that the person who wrote in is suggesting that too. But we live in a world right now where partisanship defies policy. And so when you look at, well, how do Americans feel about what happened in Orlando, if you're a Democrat, you think this is about guns. If you're a Republican, overwhelmingly you think this is about terrorism. And these two things are not meeting anywhere in the middle. Gallup went out and asked, how do we prevent another Orlando? And what a majority of Americans -- overwhelming majority said, do something about guns. The Muslims ban, very, very far down on the list of how this would prevent another Orlando.I went back and I looked at the last time that we had compromise on gun legislation. Back in the Clinton era in the 1994 assault weapons ban. Back then you had 38 Republicans that voted for it in the House, you had 77 Democrats voting against it. That era doesn't exist anymore. This idea that you could have moderate Republicans, conservative Democrats, and then could come up with a compromise. Those people are gone. And the only people left in Congress are people who believe in the partisanship and the ideology that drives their party.WALLACE:  One more thing, Brit. I want to go back to CIA Director Brennan's warning that as they're losing territory, that -- that ISIS is focusing more on foreign attacks. And he specifically talked about using the flow of refugees into the west. In a sense, doesn't that track with what Donald Trump has been saying?HUME: It does. And it illustrates that -- why Trump rings a bell with so many people on the issue. You know, it's -- it's been a paradox of this primary season, Chris, that in the polling that was done in state after state among Republican voters, immigration was ranked very low. But there's no other way to look at Trump's success without concluding that his stand on immigration, which I think in a lot of people's minds just kind of blends into limiting all immigration, legal and illegal, has been a winner for him and may continue to be if -- if, you know, this process goes on. If as he says there are more of these attacks, and he says there will be, I think that -- that helps him.WALTER: Well, that's what's interesting is that the issue of immigration was very low and yet an overwhelming majority of Republicans supported the ban on Muslims coming into the country. So they were calling it. In their own mind, they don't think of that as immigration.HUME: No. No, they think of it as terrorism.  WALTER: But it is an issue of immigration. Exactly.WALLACE:  All right. We have to take a break here. When we come back, we'll discuss the politics of this latest terror attack and the growing divide between Donald Trump and the GOP.Plus, what do you think? Will Trump pivot and become a more effective candidate for the general election? Let me know on Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and use the #fns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: A ban on Muslim would not have stopped this attack. Neither would a wall. I don't know how one builds a wall to keep the Internet out.TRUMP: She's in total denial and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world. True weakness.(END VIDEO CLIP)BLITZER: The Orlando massacre revived the debate between Trump and Clinton this week over how they would fight the war or terror. And we're back now with the panel.Amy, a couple of segments ago we talked with Senator Sessions about how Trump's poll numbers are dropping. One of the few areas where he leads Clinton is on the issue of who would be better to take on and defeat ISIS. But on the other hand, this also plays into Clinton attack on Trump as being unfit, not having the temperament to be president. So how do you see the attack in Orlando and the growing fear about terrorism cutting politically in the Trump/Clinton race?WALTER: Well, it is an interesting dichotomy and I don't -- I think voters overwhelming, when they look to see who they want to vote for president, they don't go down a checklist --WALLACE:  Right.WALTER: And go issue by issue. This person's better on this. This person -- they just have a sense of which person they think could do the job and is fit to do the job. And I think that's obviously why Hillary Clinton is trying to make the issue, not that -- just that he's unpredictable, but that he's dangerous, that his -- he doesn't have the temperament or the judgment.The thing is, there's a very strong case to be prosecuted against the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton, their roles in the last eight years in dealing with ISIS, in dealing with Syria, in dealing with Libya. But instead of being focused and disciplined on this message, where Donald Trump goes is he talks about the Muslim ban, he gets in fights with these candidates. He is even dividing his own party about this issue, about how do you deal with this issue of a Muslim ban. And so there's nobody there making that case. There's no -- it's not just the Trump campaign. He has no surrogates doing this. There is no money being spent on television ads doing this. There's no super PACs defending him and doing this. He's literally an island among himself --WALLACE:  Unto.WALTER: Unto himself. Thank you. Unto himself. And there's no reinforcements that he's getting. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is making the case every day and her allies are making the case every day, both on television and in focused, direct messaging to -- to voters.WALLACE:  Brit, I'd love to continue on this -- this same issue because, on the one hand, you know, as -- as Amy says, to the degree that -- that you have these terror attacks, that ISIS is still on the march, you can make the case against Obama and indirectly against Clinton as his -- as his secretary of state. On the other hand, as we went through with Senator Sessions, you know, here we have this terrible tragedy and Trump is talking about what else Barack Obama has in mind.HUME: Exactly right. And it's worth noting here, Chris, that in every campaign cycle, general election cycle, there are moments when the candidate gets a fresh look from the voters. And when you lock up the nominations is one such moment. These moments are few, and you can't afford to waste them. And there will be a few more, but Trump had one and he finished, you may recall, he wrapped it up before she had. So he had some open country there and an opportunity to, you know, get people to take a fresh look at him. A disciplined, active, well-planned campaign focusing on the issues that -- that could broaden his appeal would have helped him.And as Amy just pointed out, he hasn't done any of that, really. I mean he's -- he's undisciplined. He's all over the place. You know, he gets in this fight over the -- over the -- over the ethnic background of -- of a federal judge that has to do with a -- with a case involving Trump University. Totally unrelated to the campaign.You know, he overstates the case against Obama by suggesting the president may be -- is somehow sympathetic possibly to the bad guys and all the rest of it. And it's -- and it all adds up to a wasted opportunity and an opening for Hillary Clinton, who has moved aggressively. Her camp -- it's very hard to think about what her campaign is really about. Right now it's about, I'm not Trump and you don't want him and it may -- and it looks as if it's working.WALLACE:  George, I want to flip this a little bit to something else we talked about with Senator Sessions, and that's that Trump was not just fighting with Clinton and Obama this week, he was also fighting with his own party and he -- at one point he basically said he could walk away are from the party. And as we showed in the clips of McConnell and Paul Ryan, they were talking about walking away from him. Can Trump win without the RNC and -- and the infrastructure in terms of field organization, money, database that the RNC has built?WILL: I think we're going to find out. I like Amy's use of the metaphor of an island. It turns out John Dunn (ph) was wrong when he said, no man is an island. Trump is an island and he's delighted to remain so, evidently.This week, Governor Hogan of Maryland joined the list of those who said I don't --WALLACE:  Republican governor.WILL: Republican governor. Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, a Republican, who's resistant to Donald Trump, points out that Trump got 13 million votes in the primaries. He'll probably need 65 million votes to win the presidency. Where is he going to get the other 52 million? That's a lot of votes. Donald Trump's assumption clearly at this point is that running in a primary against 16 opponents is pretty much the same as running in a protracted general election against one, well-funded, tough Democratic machine. That's unlikely because what the Democrats have is a get out the vote mechanism. But this is going to be a mobilization election, not a persuasion election. There aren't' that many Americans waiting to be persuaded on either side. So if he doesn't have a get out the vote mechanism, what does he have? What he has is crowds. And like a real amateur in politics, he seems to confuse the enthusiasm of the crowds in front of him at a moment in the high school auditorium with the larger electorate. Whereas, in fact, crowds are definitionally (ph) a -- not representative selection of the American people.WALLACE: You know, Juan, it's not as if Hillary Clinton isn't a vulnerable candidate herself. Her unfavorable numbers, they're not 70 percent, but they're 55 percent. She's got a criminal investigation going on and on at the FBI. To the degree that you're not happy with Obama policies, she can be held responsible for those. And yet to the degree that they make this a referendum on Trump, not on her, those issues may not come up.WILLIAMS: That's exactly right. So it's a matter of, don't vote for the other guy. I thought Brit was on target here. It's about Trump. So we can talk about Hillary Clinton's deficits, but, in fact, right now, all the emphasis, all the analysis, all the public attention is on Trump and he's, you know, at least from my perspective, an unattractive alternative. So you say, well, who else is in this race? It's one 16 other person, as George was saying, it's one person. So the alternative to save us from Trump is then Hillary Clinton.And among Republicans, Ryan's in a tight spot. He says this guy's practicing textbook racism and then he says to his Republican colleagues running for Congress and the Senate, oh, just rely on your conscience. But the base is going say, the establishment didn't back Trump and that's why he lost. And they will blame Paul Ryan if Trump loses. So I think Ryan, McConnell, all those guys right now are trying to like just look the other way.WALLACE:  Less than a minute, Amy. The frustration is so much and I -- it's, look, it's just a handful, we're talking about 30 people, some Republican convention delegates are saying, let's go to Cleveland, let's change the rules, let's unbind everybody and have a free vote. Is that got any chance?WALTER: I -- I think it would tear the party apart, much more so than it is now. I do not understand how that would help anything other than -- than --WALLACE:  You mean the idea of 13 million people vote for this guy and you're going to --WALTER: The idea -- exactly, and then you take it out for him. And also, if you think that Donald Trump is just going to walk away after that and go, oh, you're right, you guys, you -- you -- I didn't get the nomination, I'm just going to go sit here quietly, give me a break.HUME: Let's -- let's see what happens if Hillary's lead grows to something between 15 and 20 points. I think that would change the atmosphere dramatically. I doubt it will happen, but it's possible.WALLACE:  So you think this is serious?Thank you, panel. See you all next Sunday.Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" putting a fresh face on American history.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  In this high-tech world, museums face new challenges attracting visitors and staying relevant. But the head of one museum here in Washington loves thinking outside the box. And she's our ""Power Player of the Week.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)KIM SAJET, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY: We define ourselves and our nation defines itself by the people who have created our history.WALLACE (voice-over): Kim Sajet is director of the National Portrait Gallery. The remarkable collection that chronicles the people who built America. But since she took over three years ago, Sajet, who was raised in Australia, is trying to expand our understanding of who those people are.SAJET: He hated this picture. He had to put on his wig and it was very sort of formal.WALLACE:  We begin in the most traditional part and the museum, America's presidents, with a painting of Thomas Jefferson. In fact, they have 1,600 portraits of our 44 presidents.But then she took us to a different collection called (INAUDIBLE), a multimedia portrait of the founders of Google, that keeps changing.SAJET: This is real time. So every word they say then conjures up images in the back. And, in fact, every word is being Googled.WALLACE (on camera): So it's, in effect, Goggling the Google guys.SAJET: And it is current today literally as at the moment you're standing in front of it. It will be different in three seconds from now.WALLACE (voice-over): But more than different kinds of portraits, Sajet has tried to deal with the fact most are of dead white man. Only 25 percent of the collection portrays women, even fewer people of color.SAJET: We do not believe in going back in time and trying to guess, for examples, what somebody looked like. But what we are trying to do is sort of talk about the presence of absence.WALLACE:  And so they put on performance art. In this case, of a Civil War nurse.SAJET: Warren H. Mills (ph), Delaware.WALLACE:  The commissioned a composite portrait on six acres of the National Mall called ""Out of Many, One.""And Sajet has started a new program called ""The American Portrait Gala,"" honoring people whose pictures are in the collection, from Aretha Franklin to Hank Aaron. Last year, Ted Cruz and other conservatives objected to a bust of Margaret Sanger (ph), one of the pioneers of birth control, who's been accused of trying to limit black reproduction.WALLACE (on camera): As someone who wants this museum as to be as contemporary and relevant as possible, do you kind of like these controversies?SAJET: I like having the conversation with the American public.WALLACE (voice-over): Sajet sees museums as community meeting places, where people will put down their electronic devices and engage with the art and each other.SAJET: If I can just create an environment where people stop for a minute and think about where they are, where they've been, perhaps where they'd like to go, that's a win.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Sajet is planning an all video exhibition of portraits this fall. She says she wants it to be so moving it makes people cry.And that's it for today. Have a happy Father's Day.

5	5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/09/22/authorities-brace-for-third-night-protests-in-charlotte/	Authorities brace for third night of protests in Charlotte	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" September 22, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five."" The National Guard is now activated in Charlotte after North Carolina's governor declared a state of emergency following two nights of violent riots.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CROWD: (shouting)(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Charlotte is bracing for a third night of protests, but hopefully, the extra manpower will help keep things under control tonight. It all ignited after the fatal police shooting of a black man that police still maintain was armed with a gun. It was outer chaos in the streets of Charlotte last night. Fox News Correspondent Steve Harrigan was in the middle of it all and did some amazing reporting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: We are seeing a real massive tear gas as well as reports of firing rubber bullets into the crowd. This is a lot more out of control than in Ferguson. This is a pitch battle between police and protesters that's gone back and forth for a long period of time. I'm seeing scenes here that the last time I've seen them where on the West Bank, the back and forth between Israelis and Palestinians with tear gas. That's what we are seeing here in Charlotte, North Carolina.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So Steve is back on the ground. He joins us now. Steve, thank you. So this video, it's all about this video it feels to me, the video that allegedly show, show whether or not Mr. Scott was armed or not, whether he was holding a gun or not. Now with the lawyers for the family came out and said they had not viewed the video, about an hour ago, they had not viewed the video. Has that, the fact that they came out and talked to the people, the people of Charlotte, has that calmed the tone a bit?HARRIGAN: I don't think things have calmed down at all, up and down the street here where we saw that riot last night. We are seeing similar scenes it is, people really preparing for more possible violence, hotels and merchants pulling out the glass, sometimes replacing what was shattered last night or else putting in plywood or OSB board to try and protect it for more violence tonight. That's what's going on now. At the height of the violence last night, we saw about 800 people. And I got to tell you, I think a lot of those people out there last night were not listening to lawyers and don't care whether the man who was killed by a police officer was holding a book or a gun. They are angry. They want revenge. They attacked the police last night. They said they're going to be back again tonight. So we're going to see whether that stronger police presence will slow things down tonight or not, Eric.BOLLING: We will bring it around, but any news on when the family is going to actually see it and when they're going to let the public see it?HARRIGAN: The family -- the lawyers for the family said they were too traumatized to actually speak to the media today. There have been two real sources of information throughout this conflict, very different sources. On the one hand, you have the police and public officials giving one version of events. On the other hand, you have a whole range of people, including some protesters, going on social media giving a very different version of events. So we've seen different things like a young man was shot last night during the protest. Police saying it was civilian on civilian shooting, but the people who were running from that shot saying police fired the shot. So two very different narratives depending who you listen to, officials and police or social media, a lot more direct reporting, some of it reckless.BOLLING: All right, Greg.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah, we were wondering, you are seeing these protests in Charlotte, not so much in Tulsa. Why is that? Is it because, because it's easier, perhaps, to get to Charlotte for activists or protesters? I don't know.HARRIGAN: It's a good question, because you would think on the merits of the case and the reason to protest, the situation in Tulsa might lend itself more to the protesters. They might have more way of truth on their side, and in this case where it looks like the man killed did have a gun, did have an arrest record. You had three officers present and you do have officials saying, he posed an imminent threat. Why it's happening here and not there is tough to say. And it's hard to predict what's going to happen. We saw it really ebb and flow last night. There are 10 people out on the street then there are 800 people out in the street. One thing that not turned them back, though last night was tear gas. And that's what we have seen since Ferguson. These protesters, the ones here last night, were organized and determined. Flash bang grenades, mace, rubber bullets, did not turn them back. They kept regrouping. They wanted more. They wanted to fight the police and they were out in force last night, Greg.BOLLING: All right, KG.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah, I just have a question in terms of the response. I mean, obviously, there has to be an adequate measure of public safety concern here for the businesses, the people that are around in that area to be able not to be held hostage in their homes essentially, because of fear of violence and (inaudible) along the streets. What is the plan specifically from the police department to try to curb this back so it's not a third night?HARRIGAN: Yeah, when you talk about being held hostage, that's literally what happened on Highway 277 around the city. Protesters were out on that highway and people were terrified in their cars. The chief of police said, ""Lock your doors. Help is on the way."" So that's really not too encouraging. I think if you had to summarize, with an amateur point of view, the police response last night, it was completely botched. They didn't have enough officers on the street. Protesters, time and time again gained the upper hand. It took four hours to clear these four blocks where I'm standing right now. They said it's not going to happen again tonight with the National Guard, with the governor, with a state of emergency. We're going to have to wait and see. It got ugly after dark the last two nights. It seems normal right now. That could change quickly.BOLLING: OK, Dana.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Steve, I wanted to follow up on that. Just curious what you are hearing about the cooperation between city officials and the state. So between the mayor and governor, we know that was certainly a concern and other locations where there have been protests before. And there's a struggle sometimes between those two, because a mayor doesn't want the governor to step in, but the governor feels like he or she has a responsibility to do so.HARRIGAN: I think the final result that there was a failure is clear. The governor said he's offered additional assets. It seemed like the mayor was reluctant, initially, to take those assets, put the blame on her security advisers, initially. But just for an amateur point of view, it seems like you would err on the side of caution, you would err on the side of having too many forces and then try to ramp down. That's not what happened. And by allowing the demonstrators to take control of the street for four hours, it gave them confidence and time to regroup, increase their numbers. So it put the police who were out here all night in a very tough position. There weren't allowed them. They couldn't make arrests. They were getting beer bottles thrown at their heads, three of them hospitalized, so a tough position for the police on the street last night. Not enough numbers. It was clear. And that's been admitted by the chief.BOLLING: Yeah, and the governor, by the way, said he is going to put 700 more law enforcement through the national guard on the streets tonight. Juan has a question.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: So, Steve, one of the intriguing aspects of this case to me is what happened on Facebook where you have a woman who claims to be Keith Scott's daughter -- I don't know if she is his daughter, but she's on Facebook saying, ""You know what, they killed my daddy. My daddy is dead."" And she's shouting and using profanity. And she says also, ""Let me tell you, that he was holding a book."" Now the police chief says, ""No book, a gun."" That's a very distinct narrative. And, but the idea that he was holding a book reminds me of hands up or reminds me of people, you know, I can't breathe. And I think it might have contributed to local protests. I don't think there's time enough for anybody from out of state to get there.HARRIGAN: You are right. The fact that people are able and aggressively posting on Facebook without any verification and it gets a million hits, it's almost too late after the fact. That initial impression is so strong. If it gets a million people to watch it, her narrative is out there, whether it's true or not. And that's been really one of the biggest differences since Ferguson is protesters, community activists taking control over social media, speaking directly to people without any, any real editorial guidance, any censorship or sometimes any respect for the facts of the case.BOLLING: All right, Steve, we're gonna, we're going to come back to you a little bit later in the show. Thank you very much. We will talk about this a little bit; continue for a few more minutes. But, Dana, let me ask you, will this, there's this whole debate over when to bring in additional manpower. If you do it too soon or too aggressively, it makes people agitated, it makes protesters more agitated. If you wait too long, businesses can get destroyed. People can get hurt.PERINO: And I was trying -- just spontaneously, I was thinking about that when I came up with the question. I'm trying to remember which protest it was where recently there were similar situations where they should have called in more at the time and they were -- unprepared. And even though they had warning that there was going to be protesters. So, it is just an interesting dynamic between local officials, and state officials, and even sometimes federal officials. You know, should there be additional resources required? And I know that mayors like to look -- like to say that they can handle it on their own, but I don't think there's any shame in asking the state for cooperation and additional assistance. I don't think that is a mar on anybody's record.WILLIAMS: Well, unfortunately this morning, Jennifer Roberts was on. She had a press conference with the police chief and the community relations director and she said she had consulted with her city officials about what their needs were and what they expected and come to the conclusion they didn't need the additional forces.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: But I do think that we are missing the point if we're focused on how many forces or in the like. I mean, this is something that is sweeping the country. This is the number one political issue right now in black America for sure.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: And I think it's coming to the forefront of our national politics. And it's causing alarm, because I think people realize there's something much bigger here that has been ignored by people who want accountability for the way that poor people, mostly blacks and Latinos, but poor people of all are treated by police use of excessive force.GUTFELD: But Juan, are you talking about the protests or are you talking about the rioting? Because --WILLIAMS: I'm talking about legitimate grievance, Greg.GUTFELD: OK. But, what we are looking at is not legitimate grievance. How is the shooting by a black police officer of a black man a race riot, because they are changing the story? The media is allowing the story to change. This is not about grievance. This is about opportunity to riot. That's all it is.WILLIAMS: I don't think so. I think that you have people -- now, nationally. And I think this is -- in other words, I think they're picking up on what happened in Tulsa, you mentioned Tulsa.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: I think they're picking up on that in a big way. And I think you see Ferguson, Baltimore, Chicago -- I mean, you go and on.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: At some point, you guys say, hey, there's something big going on here and we're missing it.GUILFOYLE: I don't think you are wrong, but you also have to understand there has to be respect for the rule of law. They are not making it better by committing more crimes or act of violence.WILLIAMS: I couldn't agree more.GUILFOYLE: What about the police officer? What about the police officer, the African-American officer that devoted his life? And it's a family of law enforcement, tradition of serving that within in this horrible situation, that a gun recovered at the scene, does he have a right to live?WILLIAMS: Sure, nobody's --GUILFOYLE: Does he have a right to defend himself?WILLIAMS: Of course. But I think .GUILFOYLE: It's a horrible, tragic situation, obviously.WILLIAMS: . the question is one of accountability, Kimberly. Our police officers, actually held accountable or is it the case that people like us, America's middle class, we say, you know what, thank God for the thin blue line. Keep those people over there. And if the officer is at fault, you know what, we're always going to give the officer the benefit of the doubt because we think police are pretty much good people. We're grateful for their --GUILFOYLE: I don't, I don't give the police the benefit of the doubt. I was on the Officer-Involved Shooting Team .BOLLING: Juan, Juan --GUILFOYLE: . for the San Francisco DA's office and .BOLLING: Police officers also .GUILFOYLE: . prosecuted officers --BOLLING: . is charged already. I mean, that --WILLIAMS: That's in Tulsa.BOLLING: That's in Tulsa, right -- in Tulsa. But -- a couple of quick numbers for you. Last year, 2015 or 990 people killed by police; 494 were white, 258 were black.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: And this year so far, 324 white, a hundred and seventy black.WILLIAMS: Right, so --BOLLING: Double the numbers of white people are killed .WILLIAMS: Come on.BOLLING: . by police --WILLIAMS: This is total distortion. Come on, 24 percent --BOLLING: That's not exactly .WILLIAMS: I think the number --BOLLING: . ""The Washington Post"" offers --WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah. No, no, I'm telling you something.BOLLING: Yes.WILLIAMS: 24 percent .BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . of the people being fatally shot by cops are black?BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: And if you compare the numbers in terms of black men, I told you this before, 6 percent of Americans are black men, but by 40 percent of the people shot. So, I mean it's something --BOLLING: Black population is about 13 or 14 percent, right?WILLIAMS: Yes, versus to 24 percent, that's double.BOLLING: And the 24 numbers higher than the black population --WILLIAMS: That's what I'm saying.GUTFELD: Juan --BOLLING: But the crimes being committed by that population, it mirrors the number of crimes being .WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: . committed by the white population.WILLIAMS: What?BOLLING: It -- numerically, it's -- people are being killed -- white people are being killed at a higher rate, numerically; just straight statistics. And black people --WILLIAMS: Not statistically.BOLLING: But -- if you consider the number of crimes committed by blacks versus whites, they are.GUTFELD: But the other thing, you know, there was a black female that was shot eight times over the weekend in Philadelphia. We didn't mention her about race because she was a cop. Nobody even, you know, nobody talked about the Philly ambush. There were no protests about a black female officer being shot eight times. There were no riots. There was no activism. There was no Sharpton.BOLLING: So this is more --GUILFOYLE: Yeah, where was black lives matter for that?BOLLING: This has been --GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: This is more, cop not race.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: All right? We have a lot more to talk about, because I think the brother of Mr. Scott -- Keith Scott said some pretty provocative things. We will talk a little about more, more about that coming up. Much more in this hour on the race riots in Charlotte. Ahead, race agitator, Al Sharpton actually isn't making this only a black and white issue, but he's accusing black officers of -- next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CROWD: (shouting)(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: As riots infect Charlotte, rumor replaces fact and the story becomes one of social injustice meant to indulge criminal behavior. As the media captures the gore, we stay home and we watch. Does such violence persuade us? Yes it does, to buy more guns and then wonder if we're doomed.Meanwhile, there's Al Sharpton:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AL SHARPTON, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK PRESIDENT The feeling is that many black officers know that they can get away with doing in the black community to black suspects what they would never do in another community. What you have not seen is a lot of black cops or white cops doing this to white suspects. So even though there may not be the same embedded prejudice there may be embedded that I can be more reckless here or not as cautious here. Because why don't we see this with black cops in other areas?(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: If I'm not mistaken, did he just accuse blacks of being racist against blacks? And that a black cop, serving his community, should not have defended himself, simply because he's black? Would Al prefer only whites to police blacks? Isn't that precisely the opposite of a solution?Just two months ago, five officers in Dallas were assassinated. We reacted in horror. We hailed law enforcement. But life's now an Etch A Sketch: Current events shake up the past and we're back to this.Those who wish to see America end, know the trick: racial politics. The more you separate, the less you empathize. Communication dies among unbending minds.And, as for all you pseudo-intellectual social justice warriors, save your stupid reasons for rioting. People riot because it's a riot. Meaning, it's fun. It's not about injustice, it's about euphoric violence. And we enable it by redefining such mayhem as protest.Does such violence advance your cause? Of course not. But you do get to deck a stranger.So ISIS, why bother? We're destroying ourselves without you.The big lie, I really believe this, I will go to you, Juan. It's that this is -- you said it's out of anger. When I watch footage, I see a lot of people laughing, having fun, fighting over cash registers -- not wearing shirts. That's the thing. Apparently, I don't know. It's a party.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know if it's a party, but I do know that this, the one common thread in this current behavior is young people often times teenage males.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: And by the way, Charlotte, just watching on Fox, you can see that people, different colors. There are white people --PERINO: Yup.WILLIAMS: You see a lot of people. So they are out there, because I think - -GUTFELD: Juan, its rioting. It's a unity, a unity, unity exercise.WILLIAMS: I don't know what it is, but is to me, it's destructive. I think it doesn't persuade anybody, it doesn't build alliances, it doesn't .GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . allow for bridges of understanding to come to -- that would bring people together through. I just think it's, it's, it's stupidity. But I will say I disagree with you about what al Sharpton had to say, because I think you have pointed out to me, repeatedly, that black and Hispanic cops are more likely, I think you said to shoot.GUTFELD: It's a study.WILLIAMS: OK, that's what you told me.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: So, I just would point that out to you and say that the question of accountability for cops is very real in my mind. I mean, growing up as a black person in America, you do wonder, gee, why does trash get picked up in some communities? Why are there good schools in some communities? And why do the police treat some communities as if they are protecting the community and other communities they treat as a group of suspect?GUTFELD: And so we move from calling, Eric, calling police racists to the whole system .BOLLING: Right.GUTFELD: . is now racist?BOLLING: So --GUTFELD: So we can't -- he can't win?BOLLING: Look, the brother of Keith Scott is grieving. No doubt he is angry and he is mad. But his comment was, quote, ""All white cops are effin devils and all white people."" Meanwhile, the cop who shot Mr. Scott was black. So, so, he is making it more about race, the brother of the victim is making it more about race. But Juan is telling us it's not about race, it's about an injustice to -- it's a cop's treating a community -- I guess could you add race into it you --WILLIAMS: Well, without any accountability.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: It's what Greg was saying. I say, the cops are the blue line. I think on the cop side, the cops are cops. I don't care what color they are even, OK? But it's that poor people, poor communities often feel like if they have a complaint or treated abusively, nobody listens.GUTFELD: You know, OK, but here is an interesting thing. All right, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Uh-huh.GUTFELD: The most obvious fact out of this is rioting doesn't persuade anybody to your idea, so you know you are not really persuading anyone. And in fact, you are driving people to arm themselves.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: You're going to see gun sales go up. You're going to see people that own businesses learning to protect their businesses. So, it doesn't -- the idea -- the belief that you are trying to achieve something is pure b.s.GUILFOYLE: Well, the evidence is in the video. When you show these, you know, quote, ""riots"" live, you see what's happening there. People like running around, having a good time, putting on some costumes, some face masks .GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . et cetera. Total disregard for other human life, total disregard for property, I think of the small businesses, people that have fought for their families to be able to provide, trying to be part of the solution in a community. Their property totally destroyed. Why is that OK? And now what you see? This is like the cause -- (inaudible), like everybody wants to go out and riot. It's become kind of a social occasion, which is totally insane to me as a former prosecutor, having real appreciation for the cost emotionally .GUTFELD: Right.GUILFOYLE: . and financially of violence. And now, it's like the new rave party.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: And it's just, it's too much.GUTFELD: Dana, is it -- there has to be a sense among a lot of people that it's not getting better. That society in general is going to hell in a hand basket when you see this. Is that -- as we realize that crime is going down around the world or around the United States, but you have the spikes of violence? The perception is one of doom. I mean I'm depressed by this stuff.PERINO: Well, I think, yeah.GUTFELD: I'm already depressed.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: You're depressed.GUILFOYLE: It's not helping.PERINO: But I think that those that are participating in the riot or the protest, they feel that way, too. That's what I'm getting the sense of that they have --GUTFELD: The rioters?PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: Oh.PERINO: Or the people that or --GUTFELD: Protesters?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Protesters, right. Who had, who would repeat some, maybe something that Juan had said, which is, I feel harassed every time I get pulled over by the cop. I feel like I'm pulled over more. The perception that probably is their reality and they think nobody is going to do anything. Anyway, they feel like things are doomed.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: And they only get attention when this happens.GUTFELD: Yeah, I just would separate it.PERINO: I think that's what they think.GUTFELD: I would just separate -- it's like the Skittles metaphor.GUILFOYLE: Oh, no. Here we go.GUTFELD: I know. But you know, you have to separate, there are protesters, there are rioters -- I don't think rioters and looters actually give a damn about anything, but there are protesters who do. Is that makes sense?PERINO: I think they do.GUTFELD: Yeah, all right.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: You wouldn't see (inaudible) doing this, right? When you, when you think about this in terms of effective discourse that having an open communication and discussion, this is not what it looks like.GUTFELD: Yeah. All right, the anger we have been witnessing on the streets of Charlotte isn't just about police shootings, but also about larger issues in American, African-American communities. We will discuss that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I serve a purpose, sir. I serve a purpose. My father serves a purpose. My brother serves a purpose. I'm here because, guess what, whether I'm here, I'm in school, I'm in my car -- you said, OK, a man got shot over here, right? So you basically say why would I put myself in danger, right?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right. OH, guess what? I could be at work .UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you had said --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: . at school, in my car, I could still get shot by the police! I could get shot anywhere!(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Pain and anger has been filling the streets of Charlotte, as you can clearly see there. Newt Gingrich weighs in on the latest rioting in the state of race relations in America last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: I think this is an American tragedy, oh, 53 years after Martin Luther King's great, ""I Have a Dream"" speech at the Lincoln Memorial, eight years after the election of an African-American president who said two consecutive African-American. Attorney generals, racial issues are decaying in this country, its schools that don't work, neighbored with no jobs, random violence of -- sense of being powerless even though there's an African-American president.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Dana, is that an accurate reflections?PERINO: I think the other young woman that we showed -- that was real anguish. And I don't think she was faking it. She's obviously very passionate, maybe a little spun up in the moment, but -- I think she was representing some real hurt in the community.I don't -- I don't know what it's like to be in that position. So I would like to listen to more people that are doing a good job of community relations.I think that the education thing is absolutely true. But I also believe that the decaying of the social fabric of our country is not just happening in African-American communities. It is happening across America. And especially as civic organizations decrease, especially in rural areas around the country, we are facing a big technological shift that is going to come with massive unemployment, if we don't try to figure out a way to retrain. Faith is down. Marriage is down. I mean, there's some big problems all across the country.I feel for that young woman, and I hope that there's a way to ease her anguish.GUILFOYLE: What is the way and the path, Eric, for somebody like that that is very upset and feels let down by the community, by the country? Where do you go? Where do you take her to make her feel like things are going OK?BOLLING: That's why Charlotte is such an interesting study right now.PERINO: Yes.BOLLING: If you compare Charlotte to Baltimore and Chicago or the rise in crime, Charlotte has higher levels of household income. They have lower levels of poverty. They have lower levels of unemployment. African- Americans are doing better in Charlotte than they are in some of the other major cities that have seen this type of crime.But there is one thing in common, and this may be the actual root cause to help solve some of this problem. In Charlotte, the police department is -- in Charlotte, it's 35 percent black in the city, but the police department is only 18 percent. So they're half represented by -- it's less than 50 percent representation of African-Americans on the police department. And maybe that -- and Greg has pointed this out in the past. Maybe that's what they need. African-Americans need to have a bigger presence on police departments in major cities, urban areas.GUILFOYLE: And again, you reference the -- you know, the officer involved in the shooting, African-American, with family of distinguished service.Juan, what do you do for her?WILLIAMS: For her? Well, I think the first thing to do is what Dana Perino just did, which is to say, ""I hear you."" I mean, not to dismiss her. It's easy to use her anger and the fact that she's shouting and using profanity against her and think, ""Well, you know, I don't have to listen to this person."" But I think it's a very real cry of desperation that, you know, I'm sitting in a car or I'm standing here or I -- you know, I don't know what it's like -- Donald Trump said this thing about Stop-and-Frisk going nationwide. Something that the judges have said is unconstitutional, that is known to...GUILFOYLE: Stop-and-Frisk isn't unconstitutional.WILLIAMS: Well, that's what a judge in New York said.GUILFOYLE: That's not what the rules say.WILLIAMS: And it's something that has seeded so much distrust, because people feel like, you know, the cops aren't here to protect me. They're just here to harass me. And so who are they representing?And to me, it reminds me of, like, the patriots of, you know, the revolutionary period in our country who said, ""You know? This British force in here, they've got to go.""GUILFOYLE: All right, Greg, so where do you go? Where does the race relations talk go on the walk?GUTFELD: There's -- you know, it's -- I mean, I'm gloomy. But then I look back -- I look at the big picture.We have 313 million people. We've seen dramatic reductions in crime and homicide over these decades with small spikes or, actually, significant spikes this year.But the world -- our world has gotten -- the United States has gotten immeasurably better, so that isolated incidents become more dramatic and demand more scrutiny, because there are fewer of these. The fact is there are fewer of these. Therefore, they get more attention in the 24-hour cycle.The other thing is, when we talked about this before, you know, when you talk about the fractured family and how community is breaking apart, what you lose from that is conflict resolution.It was just maybe a month or two months ago, Dwyane Wade's cousin, Nykea Aldridge, was killed. The reason why she was killed was because two thugs were trying to shoot a livery driver who, like, looked at them funny. So that's how conflict resolution is performed in communities is, ""I go find you and I shoot you."" There's no more conflict resolution, because there's no people teaching it.BOLLING: A little bit of a silver lining here. Greg points out the homicide rates are up and spiking in some of the major cities. But the incidents of cops shooting people, killing people, is exactly the same. This year, it's on pace to hit almost the exact same number this year as last year. So you're seeing a lot more crime happening, but the incidents of people getting shot by cops is down.GUTFELD: And could that be linked in the sense that the cops are pulling back -- right -- cops are pulling back, and you're seeing the rise in crime?BOLLING: Could be.GUTFELD: What is -- you call the Ferguson effect.WILLIAMS: But crime is down. You know that.GUTFELD: Yes. But in 25 of the top cities, there are spikes in homicide.WILLIAMS: Yes, spikes in homicide.GUTFELD: Right. And they're linking that to the Coolidge -- Coolidge...BOLLING: Ferguson.GUTFELD: Ferguson effect. Coolidge effect is something different. You can look that up.PERINO: You can look it up.GUILFOYLE: During the commercial break.All right. We turn to the presidential race next.BOLLING: They'll look it up.GUILFOYLE: Hillary Clinton is now openly wondering why she doesn't have a bigger lead on Donald Trump in the polls. You're going to hear all about that next. And maybe something else, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: The election only 47 days away today, and Hillary Clinton only has a very slight lead on Donald Trump, according to the latest average of polls, something that's dumfounding the Democratic nominee. So here are some of her remarks to a gathering of union workers in las Vegas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Now having said all this, why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask. Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump's record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Scary.WILLIAMS: Wow. So she's saying that especially to these union workers, gosh, Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills; he doesn't respond to contractors. But why are union people still backing Donald Trump? Eric, why?GUTFELD: Wait a minute. Is that what you got from that?GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: That was the worst thing I've ever heard. It was not fingernails on a chalkboard; it was fingernails on a chalkboard in Imax.BOLLING: That was a Trump ad, wasn't it?PERINO: In surround sound.BOLLING: That was a Trump political ad?I think -- I think he's doing well with -- with union workers. Because he speaks, he talks -- yes, he has his own airplane, and yes, he has a penthouse over there, but he literally talks like the average joe on the street. He talks like the guy you're having a beer with. And I think that resonates.And he also says a lot of things that I think union workers -- yes, they want to see minimum wage and, yes, they want to see unions more, I guess, aggressively backed.But he also -- he -- I think they're also very patriotic. I think they're also very concerned about national security. And I think Trump portrays that for the union workers. And don't forget: union workers are -- their competition is migrant workers -- Dana.PERINO: I think that they also want to get deals done. So everything in Washington has been stalled for so long. If you want an infrastructure bill, who could actually maybe get that deal done, maybe it is Donald Trump that could get it done.But the other reason she's not 50 points ahead, and not just union workers; it's Gary Johnson. He is taking so many voters away from her and suppressing her numbers. And that definitely helps Donald Trump.GUILFOYLE: I said that last night.WILLIAMS: And so she says to the union crowd, we need -- you need to have an intervention with your union workers, anybody that's fooled by Donald Trump. What do you say?GUILFOYLE: I think that probably terrified them. Because that was -- I mean, something is not quite right. You know -- Greg's laughing, because he doesn't want to say, but it's not quite right what was going on there. Something is not working well. I don't know. Because that was not helpful. That sounded like she's just whining, complaining, because she thought she was going to have it in the bag.And also, it's just highlighting a very bad negative for her, is like, despite all of this, yes...GUTFELD: Right.GUILFOYLE: ... you aren't leading him by 50.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: You must not be a good candidate.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: In fact, you may be the worst ever. In fact, Barack Obama got up and was hysterical, poor thing, because he's like, she's going to blow it.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Eight years of awesomeness -- right? That's what he said.GUTFELD: Going down the tubes.GUILFOYLE: She's destroying it. He's like, ""My legacy, canceled."" Right?GUTFELD: It reminds me of -- I said it before. She reminded me of somebody in line, like, at the Budget Rent-a-Car who's in front of you, who's arguing with the person at the counter and is looking for you to back them up.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: And she starts going, ""Can you believe this? I can't -- I wanted the Sebring convertible.""GUILFOYLE: And you're, like, looking on your phone. You look down. Yes.WILLIAMS: Well, we're going to get you -- we're going to get you the Sebring next time, Gregory.Will law enforcement be able to keep the peace in Charlotte tonight? We take you back there live next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Welcome back. And not too long from now, nightfall will descend on Charlotte, North Carolina. For two straight nights, we've witnessed the disturbing images of violent unrest. And hopefully, the National Guard can keep any protests in order tonight.Let's go back now to Steve Harrigan, who's done some terrific reporting from the ground there. Steve, I want to start off by asking, last night downtown area businesses said to employees, ""Don't come in."" Have they given any guidance for tomorrow?HARRIGAN: A concerning thing right now is hotels along the center of town here are actually telling their guests to leave, giving them cars and taking them to other hotels outside of town. This is despite the promise of a state of emergency and increased police forces. So some real anxiety here among businesses.This NBA store is replacing its windows. It was one of the many businesses along this main strip that was looted last night. They've been really quick about getting the glass back in, getting them boarded up again.But concern now in several hotels, the guests really being told, ""It's not going to be safe for you tonight on this main strip in Charlotte. You're going to have to go somewhere else.""PERINO: All right. Greg Gutfeld.GUTFELD: Very dumb question. Do stores have looters' insurance?GUILFOYLE: Theft.GUTFELD: Theft?HARRIGAN: I don't know about that. But one thing you said earlier. I've been listening to you intently, and that is the people who had their shirts off were partying. I think a lot of those people who had their shirts off were because of the gas, the tear gas. They were using them as masks.GUTFELD: How do you deal with -- how do you deal with tear gas? Because you're out there reporting.HARRIGAN: You learn a lot about tear gas, which I realize once again is very debilitating. Hits your throat and your eyes and just makes you seize up. I couldn't believe how often the protesters were going back into it. Even one guy in a wheelchair was in it.These guys were prepared, with shirts, masks. Someone was even using milk of magnesia spray in their mouth and eyes. It's important not to rub your eyes, and it's important not to wear contact lens if you're going to be tear gassed.PERINO: All right. Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Or false lashes. What can you tell us about the officer that was involved in the shooting?HARRIGAN: African-American officer. Two years on the force. Studied criminal justice. There were three other officers present. But a real dispute and a debate about whether a gun was present in the victim's hand or whether he was holding a book. Two very different narratives. And that video still has not been released two days in.GUILFOYLE: OK, and he's on leave, is that correct?HARRIGAN: Paid administrative leave, as is their policy in a shooting like this while the investigation is under way.PERINO: Juan Williams.WILLIAMS: Steve -- by the way, I was just fascinated by what you were just saying. It sounds like these people came prepared.HARRIGAN: Prepared and ready to attack. I think the focus was not on looting. When some stores like this behind me were looted last night, you had a lot of protesters shouting at the looters. So there's really different groups involved with very different goals.But the hard core, aggressive, young, angry people were not dissuaded by tear gas, by mace, by rubber bullets. They kept coming back for more.WILLIAMS: And so these are young people -- by what you see on the street, these are -- are they mostly teenagers; are they college students?And also, Steve, these are people who are coming to the downtown area, which is why, you know, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, the other big companies headquartered in Charlotte, are telling people to stay out. But they're not doing it in their neighborhoods, and typically, riots have taken place in poor neighborhoods. Not this one.HARRIGAN: You're right. And that's a key difference in strategy here in Charlotte from what we saw in Ferguson, where it was basically black-owned businesses in black neighborhoods that were set on fire.Here the target is a very affluent area. We saw people smashing the windows of the Ritz Carlton last night, jumping on a Mercedes SUV and smashing that. So they're picking their targets a lot more carefully here than they did in Ferguson.PERINO: Eric Bolling.BOLLING: So Steve, I notice -- and I'm not sure if this is unique to this -- to this situation, this event, this riot. Last night you had that altercation with a couple of people. Looked like it started to get heated up.A CNN reporter got literally pummeled, thrown to the ground, you know, pushed down to the ground aggressively. And also, a photojournalist was -- I believe was threatened to be thrown into a fire. What is it -- the simple question: Why are journalists being targeted? And are you being targeted?HARRIGAN: I think there's a real mistrust of the journalists, a real skepticism and a real emotional anger here. People -- you're dealing with people who are -- who are furious at times and emotional. So you really have to be careful. There's a lot of ways to get hurt.One of the main ways, I think, is when people start to stampede and run. You have to look around, look for a place to go.But another reason is when you have a camera with a light on, you are a target. And people were hit last night. They'll probably be hit again tonight. There's a real hatred, not just of the police but of the mainstream media, who these people feel, I think, are not really being fair in listening to them, as Dana said earlier.PERINO: All right. Thank you, Steve. You do an amazing job out there, so we appreciate it. Stay safe tonight.HARRIGAN: Thanks a lot.PERINO: ""One More Thing"" from us is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Time for ""One More Thing."" But first a programming note. Tune in for a special live edition of ""The Five"" this Saturday as we pregame the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Monday. Please set your DVRs for that.All right. I'm going to kick this off. First up, we just got word that the Scott family has viewed the video, the police shooting video. The attorney was asked if the video supported law enforcement claims about what took place. And their answer was, quote/unquote, ""No comment,"" unquote. So we'll leave it right there.All right. So my good friends at IJ Review, some awesome journalists, have a new website that they launched just today. And it's called ""Maybe.""

Do you remember back before Labor Day, we had a bunch of dogs on the set from the New York -- whatever they call it - - Humane Society of New York. Well, Angelina -- this is the beagle -- found a family. Harold Ambler, who's an excellent writer, adopted the dog. There's his children with the dog, Angelina. Blah, blah, blah. Almost losing my mind there.By the way, you should buy Harold Ambler's book, ""Don't Sell Your Coat,"" which is about climate change. Very good book. But anyway, congratulations...GUILFOYLE: Very nice.GUTFELD: ... to the Amblers for their new pet.GUILFOYLE: What about all the rest of our dogs? Let's do a follow-up.BOLLING: Newfound -- newfound dog lover at the table.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: That's awesome.GUILFOYLE: You wanted the...BOLLING: You're next, brother.GUTFELD: Purely platonic, though.PERINO: As long as it's not called Jasper, he likes it.GUILFOYLE: Jasper is going to be a movie star.BOLLING: Dana is up.PERINO: OK. So two quick things. One is I was -- had a panel discussion today that Leslie Stahl hosted over at -- she was filling in for Charlie Rose.GUTFELD: Was it wooden?PERINO: It's going to air on PBS tonight at 11. And it's not ""Sesame Street."" I got a chance to be on there with Frank Rooney and James Vowel (ph). It was a good discussion about the debate.But of course, the most important thing is this cute little story about a Dalmatian puppy named Chico. And he got away from his owner. And he ended up going into a firehouse, believe it or not. And it was in Tampa, Florida. They took him all around. They finally posted it on Facebook. Like, anybody missing a dog? Because he didn't have a little chip thing. Always get your dog chipped. And after 35,000 views on the Facebook post, Chico was reunited with his owner.GUILFOYLE: I mean, how funny is that?PERINO: Yes. What a coincidence. Right?GUILFOYLE: Dalmatian at the fire department.PERINO: It's almost like it was meant to be.GUILFOYLE: I would wander into there, too. I do love them.BOLLING: You're up.GUILFOYLE: They are the best.OK. So this is an interesting poll for you football lovers -- Dana -- at the table. So according to a poll conducted last week, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, right, has become the most disliked player in the NFL. I know this is shocking. Conducted by E-poll marketing research. Eleven hundred Americans were asked about this. OK, more than 350 players, so they had some choices. He was, quote, disliked a lot, 29 percent. That's up from 6 percent in August of 2014 that didn't feel him.PERINO: Wow.GUILFOYLE: So in the dislike category -- I don't know if you guys will figure this out, Juan and Eric. But he finished ahead as most disliked of Buccaneers quarterback James Winston, 22 percent; Dolphins...BOLLING: Jameis.GUILFOYLE: Oh, Jameis, yes. I can't see anymore. You're right, it's Jameis. And that's who he is. Dolphins defensive end -- this is another one -- Ndamukong Suh. Close enough. He's not very well-liked, 21 percent. And Patriots quarterback -- say it isn't so -- Tom Brady.PERINO: Wow. That's strong opinions.BOLLING: And by the way, that matters because with endorsements. That will hurt him with endorsements.All right. Juan, you're up.WILLIAMS: All right. So we may not have gotten the flying cars from ""Back to the Future"" yet. But we have gotten something from that classic film. Marty McFly's lace-up sneakers from the second film now a reality, folks.Nike's self-lacing sneakers go on sale at the end of November.PERINO: I want them.WILLIAMS: They're called the Nike Mag...GUILFOYLE: No way.WILLIAMS: ... and use a pressure sensor to tighten the straps until they sense resistance.PERINO: What?WILLIAMS: The shoes are rechargeable. They light up when the shoe is tightening the laces. Nike is calling them the Nike Mag.GUILFOYLE: Can't wait.WILLIAMS: And while few have been released, Michael J. Fox, who played Marty McFly, they gave him a pair. He has the first pair.GUILFOYLE: I want these so bad.BOLLING: How much? How much?WILLIAMS: You know, it doesn't matter to a man like you. A man like you.GUILFOYLE: I need these -- I need these for Ronan to get to school on time.WILLIAMS: You're getting them?BOLLING: I might.PERINO: I wonder, because he'd have to do, like, little bunny things, through the thing, around the world.BOLLING: We've got to go.PERINO: Bunny ears.BOLLING: Four seconds left.
