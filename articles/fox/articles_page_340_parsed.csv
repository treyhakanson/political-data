This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin is perhaps the most vilified woman in all of politics. And despite the relentless barrage of personal attacks that she faces from the president's friends on the left, Governor Palin is among the many outspoken conservative women who Barack Obama is unwilling to defend.However, as we have seen in recent weeks, things are much different when one of the administration's political allies comes under scrutiny from the right. When that happens, the president is quick to tell the entire world exactly how he feels. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, MARCH 6)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You know, the reason I called Ms. Fluke is because I thought about Malia and Sasha and one of the things I want them to do as they get older is to engage in issues they care about.And I wanted Sandra to know that I thought her parents should be proud of her.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, that's how he treats people who happen to agree with his political views. But when one of his mega donors like Bill Maher tees off on conservative women like Sarah Palin or Michele Bachmann, well, apparently that's fair game.On Tuesday, the president flat out ignored a reporter attempting to ask whether or not Bill Maher's $1 million Super PAC donation should be returned. And today, the White House Press Secretary made this stunning comment when asked about growing calls for the president to give back Bill Maher's money.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We are not and cannot be the arbitrator of every statement that everybody makes in the policy and political arena. As a general matter, obviously, language that denigrates women is inappropriate.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Here with reaction to that ridiculous statement from Jay Carney and the left's double standard of somebody and who is still waiting for her phone call from President Obama. Joining me now former Alaska Governor Fox News contributor Sarah Palin. Governor, welcome back.SARAH PALIN, FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR: Thank you so much, Sean.HANNITY: Governor, I almost really hate to do this, but I'm going to do it because I think we need to have this discussion. Because the president goes out there, calls for the need for civil public discourse. He has done this again and again. He has never called you. He has taken a million dollars from Bill Maher, and I think this issue has come to critical mass. I'm going to play Bill Maher who donated a million dollars to Obama's Super PAC, and what he said about you and others.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)BILL MAHER, STAND-UP COMEDIAN, MARCH 18, 2011: Sarah Palin finally heard what happened in Japan.(LAUGHTER)And she is demanding that we invade tsunami. I mean.(LAUGHTER)She said these tsunamians will not get away with this.(APPLAUSE)Oh, speaking of dumb (bleep).MAHER, SEPT. 16 2011: After the debate where this came up, she had a discussion with a woman who came to her after the debate and said that her daughter had taken the vaccine and become from the vaccine mentally retarded.(LAUGHTER)And Michele Bachmann said, mom?PIERS MORGAN, CNN, JULY 11, 2011: If you a choice gun to your head, which one of it? Palin or Bachmann?MAHER: I would need a gun to my head. I would hope Sarah Palin gets in so that they split the MILF vote.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Governor, he has also used the C-word. I want to get your reaction to all of this. Because this is a really crucial issue I think going forward in the campaign.PALIN: I don't know how anyone can sit in the audience of a commentator like Bill Maher and chuckle and laugh and think that that's entertaining. I think it's disgusting and it's dirty money that he has now provided Barack Obama's campaign, and I don't know how Barack Obama can sleep at night if he really thinks about Sasha and Malia and the treatment of some women today, how he can accept that dirty money. And granted Barack Obama has never been, I think, seen in the conventional, traditional way of we who would describe a man of valor, so it shouldn't surprise us that Barack Obama would accept that dirty money and try to get re-elected with it. But I think it does not bode well for our president's character to not speak out against that dirty money.HANNITY: You know, and it's gone a little bit deeper than that, David Axelrod is scheduled to be on Bill Maher's program. He went after Mitt Romney who said that -- talked about Rush Limbaugh's comments and said it was unfortunate, shouldn't have said it. Rush should apologized for his comments. Have you ever got an apology from Bill Maher?PALIN: No, and I do not everyone to speak to Bill Maher. I would not demean myself or other women by engaging in a conversation with such a petty and small-minded man like Bill Maher.Sean, you had also mentioned in your intro that I have not received any call from the office of the presidency. And please know that I neither desire nor do I deserve a call from the office of the presidency. And I wish that our president would save his phone calls for those who truly are deserving like Gold Star Moms and others who will forever live with the memory of losing a loved one who would be fighting in a war zone in order to protect our freedom, our freedom of press, our freedom of speech. Those who are most deserving should receive those phone calls from the office of the presidency.HANNITY: I think that's very gracious of you. And I would agree, I think the president jumping into the issue of political speeches is interesting. Because he has done this on a couple times. And on the other hand, he's been out campaigning saying, Republicans, their plan is for dirty air and dirty water. Republicans want kids with autism and Down syndrome and the elderly defend for himself. You know, as we listen on the one hand that he talks about civility and discourse and jumps into the Rush Limbaugh controversy, but takes a million dollars from Bill Maher, lectures on the one hand, his surrogates attack on the other hand, he attacks on the other hand. What are we to make of what this says about the President?PALIN: Our president is the one who is trying to divide our country. He not in this to unify America and to solidify our place as the exceptional nation in the world. He is trying to divide us based along lines of gender, of religion, of income, even of race. Look at his embracing of Derrick Bell, the radical college racist professor whom he, you showed in a video last night, embraced literally and figuratively asking others to open their hearts and minds to the radical agenda of a racist like Derrick Bell who believed that white men oppress blacks and minorities. And Barack Obama, evidently at least at the time believed what Derrick Bell believed.HANNITY: I'm going to ask you in the next segment about that because we don't have enough time in the segment. I'm going to bring up some of the Breitbart tapes from last night and get your comments on it, but in the short time we have in this segment, I want to get your take on the results from Super Tuesday and what you think it means for the Republican Party. Mitt Romney won six of the states. You said that you had voted for Speaker Gingrich in Alaska. Where do you think it stands right now? Do you think this goes a lot further? Do you think that Mitt Romney is inevitable?PALIN: I don't think that anything is inevitable. The numbers are what the numbers are though and Romney certainly is leading in delegate count. But no, nothing is inevitable and I do appreciate that these men are continuing to duke it out in the arena of ideas and are allowing themselves to be vetted. Because, look at the tragedy that is happening in America today with us becoming less and less solvent, more and more beholden and shackled to foreign countries and less energy independent, less secure. Because our sitting president was not vetted. So, thank you, gentlemen, who are running on the GOP ticket, staying in there, allowing yourself to be vetted by the media because they didn't do it when Barack Obama ran.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.
