Un-occupiedAlmost three months ago, former White House adviser Van Jones predicted Occupy would expand from strictly protests to politics. He said it would recruit 2,000 candidates to run for office under the 99 percent banner.You'll remember, back in October, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi gushed that the Occupy movement was young, spontaneous, focused and -- quote --""it's going to be effective.""The USA Today editorial board writes the Occupy Wall Street movement is fading out in a whimper mostly because of lack of action, leaders and clear goals.Quote -- ""Future political operatives might view it as a case study in how not to organize a lasting movement.""Like a Prayer'Madonna fans in Israel have created a Facebook page in hopes of convincing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to attack Iran until after the Material Girl's May 29th Tel Aviv show.Performers have canceled shows in the past because of political upheaval in the country.South of DisorderA Mississippi state representative has introduced a bill that would change the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, at least for official state purposes.Democrat Steve Holland told the New York Daily News the bill is to protest the Republican majority's legislative priorities that he says focus on superfluous stuff like running illegal immigrants out of the state.A Whale of a RulingA federal judge has ruled that whales and other animals are not persons and therefore, are not covered under the slavery amendment in the Constitution.Animal rights group PETA had filed the lawsuit against Sea World claiming its performing orcas were being forced into slavery."

Sanford tells the Hill newspaper that Clyburn -- who is also from South Carolina - went too far when saying why he wanted federal money from the stimulus sent back home to lawmakers' districts.Clyburn said of Sanford, ""He happens to be a millionaire. He may not need help for the plantation his family owns, but the people whose grandparents and great-grandparents worked those plantations need the help.""Sanford says Clyburn is ""playing the race card as (a) way of trying to defend stimulus packages and deficit spending."" He says Clyburn is ""ripping off the very grandparents and grandkids he alleges to support.""Southern ExposureThe president of the Alabama NAACP is unhappy that Mobile's Azalea Trail Maids will be the only group to represent the state in the inaugural parade next Tuesday. WSFA.com reports Edward Vaughn says the 50 high school seniors in the racially integrated Southern Hospitality group that features hoop skirts, parasols, and bonnets remind him of slavery days.""These are not just regular costumes. These are the costumes that remind someone of the plantation in 'Gone with the Wind'"".The Presidential Inauguration Committee chose the parade participants. Vaughn says ""If I have to blame anyone, it's the Obama campaign for selecting those girls."" Montgomery resident Carolyn Tius called Vaughn's charge unfounded saying, ""I don't see it. It's just a regular dress to me. Just a dress they wore back in the day.""Plaque BuildupVermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders managed to persuade The Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery to change the wording on a plaque accompanying a portrait of President Bush. Cybercast News reports Sanders -- who describes himself as a Democratic socialist -- wrote a complaint saying he believed the sign's language suggested a linkage between the terrorist attacks of September 11 and the subsequent U.S. invasion of Iraq. The plaque referred to Mr. Bush's two terms being marked by ""a series of catastrophic events: the attacks on September 11, 2001 that led to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq...""Gallery Director Mark Sullivan wrote back to the senator saying the plaque would be changed and the words ""led to"" would be omitted. A spokeswoman for the gallery says no other presidential plaque has ever been challenged or changed.Waste Not, Want NowAnd finally, Britain is receiving some criticism from Taxpayers' Alliance Chief Executive Matthew Elliott for a government initiative to reduce the amount of food that people throw away. The Telegraph newspaper says the door-to-door campaign began this week. Officials visit homes to dispense advice on how to cook with leftovers and limit portion sizes. Critics call the visitors ""food police"" and one says, ""This is a prime example of excessive Government nannying, and a waste of public money and resources. In the grip of a recession, the last thing people need is someone bossing them about in their own kitchen.""The project is part of the government's ""Love Food Hate Waste"" campaign which has cost almost $6 million dollars so far.-- FOX News Channel's Zachary Kenworthy contributed to this report."

Admiral Mullen's open letter to those in uniform will appear in the upcoming issue of Joint Force Quarterly, an official military journal.He writes, ""The U.S. military must remain apolitical at all times. It is and must always be a neutral instrument of the state, no matter which party holds sway.""Mullen says military personnel should remember their sworn duty as the nation prepares to elect a new president: ""Keeping our politics private is a good first step. The only things we should be wearing on our sleeves are our military insignia.""False PretensesTwelve-term Pennsylvania Democratic Congressman Paul Kanjorski says frustration led him to make remarks that are all over the Internet, in which he claims Democrats campaigning in 2006 deliberately misled voters that they would end the Iraq war.The video shows Kanjorski's comments during an August 2007 town meeting: ""We didn't say it, but we implied it, that we if we won the congressional elections, we could stop the war. Now anybody who was a good student of government knew that wasn't true. But you know, the temptation to want to win back the Congress, we sort of stretched the facts.""The Hill newspaper reports Republicans say Kanjorski has admitted to what they call a fraudulent agenda. Kanjorski's Republican opponent this fall says the Democrat indicted himself and his party by admitting to purposefully deceiving the voters.Something in the AirA group in Santa Fe, New Mexico says its members are allergic to wireless Internet and cellphone signals and wants wi-fi banned from public buildings. A local TV station reports the group says that putting wi-fi in public places is discrimination under the Americans With Disabilities act. One man says the signals give him chest pains that won't go away. The city attorney is checking into the group's claim of discrimination.But Santa Fe City Councilor Ron Trujillo says, ""It's not 1692, it's 2008. Santa Fe needs to embrace this technology, it's not going away.""Thumbs DownThe Saint Petersburg, Russia Communist Party is calling for a boycott of the new Indiana Jones movie, because it says the movie's portrayal of Soviet soldiers and agents is disgusting, warped and unrealistic.The London Times reports ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" opened on a record 808 screens in Russia.

Speaking plainly, it is better for you not to come here. You will be beaten and despised.""The Party's Central Committee says the film is an attempt to slander Soviet communists and poison young people against them. One blogger on the party's Web site said Ford and co-star Cate Blanchett are ""second-rate actors serving as the running dogs of the CIA.""-- FOX News Channel's Martin Hill contributed to this report."
