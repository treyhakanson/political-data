This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, Britain breaks free of the European Union, sending shockwaves all across the world. Now, in a historic 52 to 48 percent vote, the people of the United Kingdom chose to take back their national sovereignty in a strong rebuke against the global ruling elite.Earlier today, while visiting his golf course in Scotland, Donald Trump praised the decision. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: People want to take their country back. They want to have independence, in a sense. And you see it with Europe, all over Europe. You're going to have more than just - - in my opinion, more than just what happened last night. You're going to have, I think, many other cases where they want to take their borders back, they want to take their monetary back, they want to take a lot of things back.I really do see a parallel between what's happening in the United States and what's happening here. People want to see borders. They don't necessarily want people pouring into their country that they don't know who they are and where they come from. They've taken back their independence.  And that's a very, very important thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And here with reaction is former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Mayor, before I get to anything, it's interesting that the president, like he tried to weigh in on the Israeli election, tried to weigh in here and say, Oh, we're going to put you in the back of the queue, we're going to put you in the back of the bus.And he kind of reiterated that today. I want you to hear how he tried to impact this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: ... say that maybe some point down the line, there might be a U.K./U.S. trade agreement, but it's not going to happen any time soon because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc of the European Union to get a trade agreement done, and U.K. is going to be in the back of the queue.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Going to be in the back of the queue.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Well, apparently not. Why would you say that to one of our closest allies, though, and Hillary, I think, sharing that position?RUDY GIULIANI, R-FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Well, I think this is a much bigger decision than people realize. This is really a major setback for the whole Obama/Hillary Clinton/John Kerry internationalist view of the world, that every nation is the same, America, nothing special about America, we should all have an international view of everything.And this is a rejection by a group of independent people, the British people. After all, we have some ties to them, right? And they've basically said the E.U. has screwed things up so badly following, basically, Clinton and Obama policies...HANNITY: Right.GIULIANI: ... that we don't want to be -- we don't want a part of it. You know, we're a country that -- we're a country that comes from Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, not from Karl Marx. And we believe in hard work we believe in individualism.And I think the British people made a very, very heroic stand with a tremendous effort against it. I mean, the effort against it was unbelievable!And I think they reflect something that is going on in America. I think Americans are saying, We are an exceptional country, we are an exceptional people, we're not just part of some kind of big European Union and everybody else can tell us what to do.We're not going to lead from behind. We want to assert our principles because we believe our principles can help the rest of the world.HANNITY: You know, here's an interesting political point. Bernie Sanders said today that globalism -- this proves globalism is not working. Now, one of the reasons that I think Donald Trump is resonating with blue collar workers in Pennsylvania and in Michigan and Wisconsin, Ohio, has to do with the fact that so much of our manufacturing centers have been sent abroad.  Companies are leaving. Americans are losing jobs. Illegal immigrants are competing for the jobs that are available, driving down wages.GIULIANI: Right.HANNITY: How big a part did immigration and the Islama-ization (sic) you think play ion the vote of the British people?GIULIANI: So I think a couple of things really played in that vote. I just came back from Israel this morning. And I was in Germany two weeks ago, and I've been in Europe quite a bit in the last three or four months.  And this thing was going the other way about four months ago, meaning it was going in the way of Remain.First of all, I think we can't discount what happened here in the United States, in Orlando. That resonated in Europe because it reminded them of Brussels and Paris. And although the administration did everything they could to try to downplay the Islamic terrorist part of this, the Brits got it because they're people of common sense, right? They saw the same vulnerability.Number two, I think that the idea that they're basically going to have to support countries that will not work more than 30 or 35 hours a week, like Greece, like Italy, which is on vacation for about a third of the year -- I think...HANNITY: By the way, that sounds appealing on the surface, but I don't think it runs an economy very well!(LAUGHTER)GIULIANI: No, no, not if I'm working 50 weeks a year.HANNITY: I'm working 80 hours.GIULIANI: And you're working 30, right, and I'm paying for you and the money's coming out of my family, right?HANNITY: Right.GIULIANI: So we're talking about very practical people. The British people are very practical, sensible people. And so are we. And I think that's what -- that's what -- that's what you're seeing -- that's what you're seeing here.I think the American people realize that this global view of the world that Obama embraces, that Hillary embraces, that Bernie Sanders embraces, we should be like just -- just like everybody other country. We're not...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: No, I know, but Bernie's on the other side. Here's a question I have. In the last two years, our Census Bureau says we brought in three million immigrants in this country, legal and illegal. So my question is, how much do you think immigration played a part in this vote, and also how much did Islama-ization (sic) of Europe and the refugee crisis play in this vote?GIULIANI: I think the second more than the first, but they kind of connect with each other, right? The second one made the first one much more dramatic. The second one, meaning the whole Islamic tide in Europe, and which is much more out of control than the United States -- I think that made the immigration issue a much more dramatic issue.All you have to do is go to London, go to Paris and just walk around the streets, and you can see a major difference in the Paris and London of today and the Paris and London of five years ago. And also, I know that the number of terrorist threats in Paris and London are much greater than in the United States. And at least the security people there know it, and I think the people of the country feel it. And I think that had a lot to do with it.Then I think, all of a sudden, when it happened here in the United States, where we have a much more integrated Islamic population, I think that really made a very, very big difference.I also think President Obama opening his mouth helped a lot here...(LAUGHTER)GIULIANI: ... because they don't trust President Obama. I don't think they trust him. I think the same thing...HANNITY: I'm laughing.GIULIANI: I was just in Israel, and you know, people who are very close to Bibi Netanyahu basically told me, you know, to thank President Obama for helping to reelect him.HANNITY: Well, do you think this -- does this basically -- is this a predictor of things to come...GIULIANI: I believe it is.HANNITY: ... in November because that tide will continue here?GIULIANI: I believe here, and I think you're going to see other European nations start to weigh this whole issue of, Are we better off with a little more separation and a little bit more -- like the way we do it in the States. You know, we have this wonderful idea of states' rights, so we can do it a little bit different in Texas than in -- actually, a lot different in Texas than in New York, a lot different in Florida than in California.  It creates -- it creates an ability for us to remain together because we have these differences, and I think the E.U....HANNITY: Yes.GIULIANI: The E.U. was cutting that off for these European nations.HANNITY: All right. Will you work for Donald Trump if he asks you and offers you a job?GIULIANI: Well, I don't know about offering me a job and wanting to leave my own job, which I love so much, but I certainly am for Donald Trump. I think Hillary Clinton would be a massive disaster, possibly the worst mistake America ever made.HANNITY: I think Obama was, but yes, I think she'd be a continuation of that mistake.GIULIANI: No, no, no. I think following Obama, she'd be the worst mistake. Maybe not following Obama, but following Obama, she'd be the worst mistake.HANNITY: All right, thank you. Mayor Rudy Giuliani, thank you.GIULIANI: Thank you.HANNITY: We appreciate it.Now, before we go, a quick programming note. Be sure to tune in this Monday night, 10:00 Eastern, a ""Hannity"" exclusive with Gary Byrne, the former Secret Service officer stationed outside of Bill Clinton's Oval Office. He'll share explosive new details about Clinton secrets and scandals. That's Monday 10:00 PM.And coming up tonight, more on Britain leaving the European Union and the impact that will have on the presidential race right here at home as we continue tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So what impact will Britain leaving the E.U. have on our presidential election here at home? Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor, former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen, and a member of Trump's national finance committee, co-host of ""Wall Street Week"" on the Fox Business Network, Anthony Scaramucci.Anthony, I was watching you this morning. I thought you really understood well that, number one, immigration played very big in this vote in Great Britain. And number two, a rise of nationalism in great Britain, as well, issues that seem to be impacting this election. Trump was right, and Hillary and Obama were dead wrong on this.ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, TRUMP NATIONAL FINANCE COMMITTEE: Yes, he's been right on this all year, Sean. I think the central key piece of this is when global elites are misaligned from the lower and middle class, you see this sort of a breach. And so that's what happened in great Britain, and I think it bodes well for Mr. Trump as we go into the November election because you could also see that the polling was wrong.You had the Bradley effect going, Sean, with the polling, where people are not really telling you exactly what they're going to do until the curtain closes in the campaign booth -- the polling booth.HANNITY: I heard you say that this morning. I thought you were dead-on accurate with that. I think there's going to be a hidden Trump vote out there, as well, that maybe people won't tell pollsters.Doug, you actually, I think, agree with that, that there might be people voting for Trump that maybe they're not going to tell a pollster.DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, certainly, under these circumstances, I think that's possible. I should say for the record, our polling predicted a 4-point victory for the Leave side.But Anthony is exactly right. The working class voters here in London -- I'm sorry, outside London, here in England, really are reflective of what the vote Donald Trump got in the primary, economically depressed, angry about governance from Brussels and from London, and it's the same syndrome in America.This does not bode well today for Hillary Clinton, even though there's a lot of difference between...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Doug, here's an interesting point. You know, Bernie Sanders even said this represents a rejection of globalism. Now, Trump has been very pointed in his criticism of the Clinton years, the support of NAFTA, Hillary supported TPP, for example, and how this is going to play in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania and New Jersey.I think this has a real, real strong chance that maybe those more conservative Democrats that have been disappointed with the Democratic Party might switch over because they want jobs back. We have 95 million Americans out of the labor force.SCHOEN: I think that that is certainly very, very possible. Trump has to stay on message, and I know Anthony shares my view that this is going to take a focused campaign if he's going to be successful against the $2 billion Clinton machine that will be very, very aggressive.HANNITY: Well, that's for any campaign. And you know what, Anthony? I think this certainly was a turning of the corner this week for the Trump campaign.SCARAMUCCI: Yes.HANNITY: Their rapid response team was up and running. His speech -- I thought it was the best speech he gave so far.(CROSSTALK)SCARAMUCCI: What about the press conference, Sean? The press conference this morning was also fantastic, and Mrs. Clinton has not had a press conference. I guess she's going to tweet about it and issue statements.  But at some point, she's going to have to face the press and explain how she's in conjunction with the rest of our society in terms of the direction that it wants to go.So Mr. Trump had a fantastic week this week. We did an event for him at Le Cirque. We did one at Cipriani (ph). We've raised...HANNITY: Didn't he raise, like, $12 million?SCARAMUCCI: Yes. I would say it's in the ballpark of $11 million, $12 million. We're super-happy. I mean, those results are getting published, obviously, at the end of the week.But the momentum is there. You'd be blown away, Sean, by the grass roots energy on the campaign, people walking into us on the street saying, Where can I give, where's the Web site, give me the link.HANNITY: Yes.GIULIANI: That happened in Great Britain. It's happening here.HANNITY: Think about this, Doug. This is interesting because Hillary is tied to every Obama economic policy, and he has accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined. We have now a 40-year record in terms of the lowest labor participation rate in all those years. We have 12 million more Americans in poverty and on food stamps. And you have one in five American families without a single worker.And then she says, Let's build bridges and not build walls, when illegal immigrants are taking jobs, driving down wages? We certainly see the impact of illegal immigration on our criminal justice system, our educational system, our health care system.Everybody in these border states are paying a big price. And of course, she wants to bring in more refugees, even more than Obama by 550 percent!SCHOEN: Sean, I think the point you made that is most relevant today in America is that the Supreme Court ruled against the Obama immigration policy by upholding the appellate court decision. That's huge for Trump, gives him an opportunity. But he's got to articulate an alternative economic policy. You and I have talked about this on the radio. I believe...HANNITY: But he did that this week.SCHOEN: Well...HANNITY: He laid out...SCHOEN: He's got to keep doing it. Sean, it's message discipline.HANNITY: Agree.SCHOEN: You have it, I'm not sure he does.HANNITY: I agree.SCARAMUCCI: Lots of good stuff coming, Sean, from the campaign in terms of the substance over the next couple of weeks.HANNITY: All right, guys. Good to see you both.And coming up next right here tonight on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump exposing all of Hillary Clinton's scandals in a major speech earlier this week, yet the mainstream media is flat-out ignoring her long history of corruption. We won't on this program. When we come back, we'll get reaction with Laura Ingraham.That and more straight ahead tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" Donald Trump is now going after Hillary Clinton hard. Earlier this week, the presumptive GOP nominee delivered a major speech exposing Clinton's long history of corruption and wrongdoing. Here are some of the highlights.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States!Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund, doing favors for oppressive regimes and many others, and really many, many others in exchange for cash.Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs and foreign governments in the years since 2001. They totally own her, and that will never, ever change, including if she ever became president, God help us!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, the Trump campaign -- they also unveiled a brand-new Web site, Lyingcrookedhillary.com. Yet despite mounting evidence against the Clinton machine, well, the mainstream media continues to give her a free pass.Now, earlier, I spoke with the editor-in-chief of Lifezette, Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham about this and much more.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Let's start with the overview of the speech that Trump gave yesterday, or the other day. He said, like, world class liar, probably the most corrupt person to ever seek the presidency, using the State Department as her personal hedge fund to enrich herself, you know, $153 million, all of that.How does that resonate? I mean, if I'm a Democrat, I'm thinking, That's really corrupt. That's old and corrupt.LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I think he painted her successfully as yesterday's news and more of the same. If the election, Sean, turns out to be a referendum on, How are you doing today versus seven-and-a-half years ago, or whether you like the current situation with the economy and foreign policy, I think Trump does pretty well.And he effectively painted her as the status quo, which as we see in every poll, 65 percent of the country thinks we're going in the wrong direction.  Hillary Clinton's part of that. I mean, she served the first term in the Obama administration.I think he did that really well, and I think he combined that with an appeal to the Bernie Sanders voters and an appeal to an unusual demographic, which is the Latino and the African-American vote, unusual for Republicans.And I thought it was very powerful. He said, look, I'm going to put more money in your pocket. You're going to have jobs that are better paying because I'm putting America's interests first, and that means you first, not me, you. And I thought that was a powerful...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: He said that. And he said, I'll end the special interest monopoly in Washington. So what you're really saying is if the campaign becomes about Donald Trump's temperament and he doesn't counter that argument with a strong narrative that he's presidential, has solutions to the problems, if it becomes about issues, she loses. If it becomes about corruption and how Washington's failing, she loses.So the only weapon, it seems, in their arsenal is to question Donald Trump's temperament, and that's where they seem to be going.INGRAHAM: Yes, and they seem to be doing very clever little clip jobs, Sean, of Republicans who have criticized Donald Trump not just during the heated primary season, but afterwards. So they're using Romney, they're using even Marco Rubio and others to lay out the case against Trump, which is why it's so -- it's so incredibly frustrating, to say the least, for a lot of these Republican leaders not to stand strong against Hillary Clinton and for Trump because they're coming at him with everything they have.And it's not her record. It's about him and whether he's suited for the presidency, despite her lack of any real accomplishment. So we need Republicans to stand strong.HANNITY: How is the issue of a thousand foreign donations going to resonate? How is the issue of $153 million in speech money that her and her husband get, that's from Wall Street, that's from big banks, that's from insurance companies, and it's also from foreign countries?How does that -- you know, if you want to be a leader and you want to be independent, you want to get rid of corruption, there seems to be a very anti-Washington sentiment this year. It's the year of the outsider, Bernie and Trump. Does all that begin to weigh down her campaign?INGRAHAM: Yes, I think most people think Washington's a corrupt place, and she is of Washington. She's been around this town for, you know, 25 years.  And more often than not, the Clintons are part of the problem. And he's made that case very strongly.In the end, I think this election, though, is going to be about the economy and jobs. That's his sweet spot because more people believe that he has experience creating jobs. He's not perfect. No one is. You know, he's had a couple bankruptcies. But I'd say the biggest bankruptcy of all is the bankruptcy of accomplishment on the part of Hillary Clinton. She has no accomplishments. And so that's...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I mean, think about this. She's secretary of state. The vacuum for ISIS is created. They give up on Iraq. That means ISIS takes Mosul, Fallujah, Ramadi and Tikrit. They didn't challenge Syrian president Assad.  That means ISIS has a vacuum there. They have the financial resources of oil because we pulled out too early. Add to that the disaster of Libya.  Add to that the disaster of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood head, Mohamed Morsi, in getting rid of an ally in Egypt, and then a Russian reset and a China trade deficit.Where's the success as secretary of state? What do you point to?INGRAHAM: Right. And that goes back to it's not working. It hasn't worked. And I think Trump said very clearly the other day -- look, this is a stark choice for America. We can continue to lose ground internationally, lose influence as China is rising and threatening us, frankly, as is Russia, or we can be a strong, sovereign independent nation where America's interests are put first.I think that's music to the ears of a lot of the Bernie Sanders voters. I think...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: That's music to my ears. I mean, isn't that true, though, I mean, we've allowed other countries to outmaneuver us on trade?INGRAHAM: It's embarrassing. It's embarrassing.HANNITY: Right?INGRAHAM: On every score. And Sean, think about it. For the first 200 years of this republic, we've had basically the dominant economy in the world! And over the past really 15 years, we have seen ourselves, maybe 20 years, systematically lose ground, really, systematically lose ground to, like, .7 percent growth as China has annual growth of 7 percent.Now, I mean, that is not a good narrative. And Republicans have some blame. Democrats have a lot of blame over the last seven-and-a-half years.  But that that's...HANNITY: So then...INGRAHAM: I think that -- that is -- that is Donald Trump's most powerful argument. I'm a creative agent of positive change, she is a defender of the global kleptocracy and the global elites who benefited from this corrupt system. I think that's a powerful narrative...HANNITY: All right...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: So if every exit poll shows that 65 percent of Americans feel that she's dishonest, untrustworthy and she lies, and most people feel Washington is corrupt, I don't even know why this election would be close on paper if they're looking for that change agent.INGRAHAM: I think Trump -- that's why Trump has to be careful in the way he runs the campaign. That's why he can't make unforced errors and give them ammunition to use against him.That's why I think he has to be, like, a laser beam focus, to use a very tired cliche, on the economy, on America and putting America first, on a strong military and foreign policy. He hit that note this week, and I think he hit it powerfully. I mean, people can say, Well, he's not perfectly polished on the teleprompter and the speech was too long. Those are the criticisms I've heard. That's fine. But the content, I think, was very, very powerful for that middle America voter...HANNITY: OK...INGRAHAM: ... and the independent voter.HANNITY: ... so then -- then explain Lindsey Graham giving a speech this week, saying he thinks Hillary's going to win. Explain the reluctance and resistance of Paul Ryan. Here we have the Orlando attack. Here we have everything Trump laid out against Hillary and her failed record. I've never heard Paul Ryan be as hard and as harsh against Hillary and the corruption and the lies...INGRAHAM: Never. Never.HANNITY: ... and the cover-up as he is against Donald Trump. It seems that, you know, people that are viewed as mainstream Republicans are sabotaging the campaign. Why would they do that?INGRAHAM: Well, because in the end, they agree with Hillary on more issues than they agree on with Trump on. I mean, when it comes to...HANNITY: You really believe that, on immigration, on open borders, globalization?INGRAHAM: I believe, Sean, if Hillary Clinton becomes president, in the first 100 days, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, if they're still the head of their respective chambers -- I think they'll both work with her on Trans Pacific Partnership. They might push it through in a lame duck session, meaning millions of jobs are going to go overseas.And I think they're going to push for an immigration reform compromise. I think they want that -- they think they want that monkey off their backs, and if they do that, the Latinos and other immigrant groups will love them.  I think what they'll do -- they've gone a long way to destroying the Republican Party already. But I think that's over. I mean, I think the Republican Party as we know it is over. It's not Trump destroying the party. It's the people who refuse to learn about what the people want and the voters want.HANNITY: All right, Laura Ingraham, thanks for being with us.INGRAHAM: Great to see you.HANNITY: And coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity""--(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Hillary illegally stashed her State Department e-mails on a private server. She's under investigation, but it seems like nothing's going to happen.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump this week continued to slam Hillary Clinton for her ongoing e-mail server scandal as she refuses to accept responsibility.  We'll check in with judge Jeanine Pirro and Jay Sekulow, that and more tonight right here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news headquarters, I'm Jackie Ibanez.Cuba is saying no to some members of the U.S.' Congress. The country is denying visa applications for five members of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee. Those lawmakers were hoping to travel there to examine lagging security at the country's airports. Officials say Cuba is set to start making 110 daily flights into the U.S. from 10 airports this fall.And a 25-year-old police officer is in critical but stable condition tonight after he was shot multiple times near Philadelphia. Officer Christopher Dorman was responding to reports of drug activity when the shooting occurred. The incident took place about one block from commuter train tracks leading to delays for hundreds of passengers. So far we know that at least one person has been taken into custody.I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now let's get back to HANNITY. For all your headlines, logon to FoxNews.com.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Hillary illegally stashed her State Department e-mails on a private server. She's under investigation, but it seems like nothing is going to happen, even though other people who have done similar things, but at a much lower level, their lives have been destroyed. It's a rigged system, folks.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That was Donald Trump slamming Hillary Clinton over her server scandal. Now, despite all the criticism, Clinton still refuses to accept responsibility for what she has done, and instead she's tried numerous times to just brush it aside. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: When I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal e-mail account, which was allowed by the State Department.I did not receive nor sent anything that was classified.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you wipe the server?CLINTON: What, like with a cloth or something? No.By the way, you may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account.  I love it. Those messages disappear all by themselves.My use of personal e-mail was allowed by the State Department. It clearly wasn't the best choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, earlier, I asked the chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, Jay Sekulow, and the host of ""Justice,"" Judge Jeanine Pirro, about Clinton's server scandal. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Did she violate laws? ""You mean, did I clean it with, like, a cloth?"" Maybe very cute. ""I never sent or received classified information."" That turned out to be false. How vulnerable --JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Right.HANNITY: -- is she here in terms of a criminal referral at least from the FBI director?SEKULOW: I think on the criminal referral side, especially Sean you mentioned, and I got a copy of some of the documentation. You have got this thing called portion marking which is the classification. She's made that position, I've not taken anything, I've not received anything classified. That proved to be false. Actual e-mails that have been released were marked classified.So the criminal referral is easier to see happen than the actual indictment, which is the position I've had since the beginning of this, because what happens here is the FBI didn't simply go through the evidence.  They go through the evidence. They make a determination based on that evidence what is a criminal case and what is not. They package that up.  They give to the justice department. So I think the criminal referral is more likely than the actual indictment. I just don't see Loretta Lynch --  (CROSSTALK)SEKULOW: -- doing an indictment.HANNITY: That's as big a political scandal. You know, it's very -- isn't the mishandling, alone, Judge Jeanine, isn't that in and of itself a crime?JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO, HOST, ""JUSTICE"": Yes. And I don't know what everybody's dancing about here. Jay is absolutely right. The truth is that the FBI will probably make a criminal referral. The issue is then whether they will have access to a grand jury.Now, she -- the woman, you know, Sean, I have to tell you, watching that intro, every time she opens her mouth she lies. I don't think she knows the difference between a truth and a lie. She says I did it for convenience. Meanwhile, she had two BlackBerries, she had an iPad, all this other stuff.HANNITY: All right, I don't want to interrupt you but I want to play something. And then I'll let you finish your thought, because this is important. She said she had a personal e-mail server so she could carry one device.PIRRO: Right.HANNITY: Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails instead of two.I think that it might have been smarter to have those two devices from the very beginning.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: IPhone or Android?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: IPhone.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: OK, in full disclosure, and a BlackBerry. I have, you know, an iPad, a mini iPad, an iPhone, and a BlackBerry.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Somebody with one device has an iPad, a mini, an iPhone, and a blackberry.PIRRO: Yes.HANNITY: So she just lies and she gets caught.PIRRO: She lies and nobody seems to care about it.Here is the danger. This is a woman who -- you know, she's so worried about Donald Trump and Donald Trump's temperament. This woman is just a liar. There's nothing that she talks about, whether it's Benghazi, a video, or whether it's the Clinton Foundation, forgetting to put moneys that come in. The woman lies constantly. She could be indicted if there were access to a grand jury.But let me tell you, Sean, this woman, the problem is primarily that she was communicating with Barack Obama on this private e-mail server, and he knew about it. So in order for him to be -- if she's to be indicted, they'd have to call him as a witness.HANNITY: Jay, let me go into that. Let me also show this week we learned that Hillary Clinton's server caused security concerns within the federal government.SEKULOW: Right.HANNITY: But I'm going to play her in 2015, and actually now the State Department staffers wrestled for weeks in December of 2010 over a serious technical problem that affected e-mails from then Secretary Hillary Clinton's home e-mail server, causing them to literally temporarily disable security features on the government's systems. So let's flash back to March of 2015. She contradicts herself. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: There were no security breaches. The use of that server, which started with my husband, certainly proved to be effective and secure.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Jay, that's just -- she just contradicts herself left and right.  I got to believe if I'm James Comey --SEKULOW: Here's the problem, of course, and that is that statement is incorrect, and unfortunately for the former secretary of state, the State Department's inspector general issued a lengthy report refuting those statements, in fact saying there was not only security breaches but that secured personnel were put at risk. And remember, the secretary of state also had said previously that, in fact, she had relied on State Department legal counsel, they were aware, and they said they didn't even know she had a private server. So the legal department saying they didn't know anything about it.So I think this goes back to what Judge Jeanine said, and that is at the end of case, I think making the case from the agents, and I used to do this when I was at treasury. We would make the case and I have to ship it over to the Justice Department, and they've got to determine whether they're going to empanel the grand jury. And I think what Judge Jeanine said is completely correct. The fact that some of those e-mails went to the president I think means that the president is not going to authorize his attorney general to go ahead and issue -- have a grand jury empanelled to review this case. I just don't see it.HANNITY: Judge?PIRRO: Then the question is, what about the Clinton Foundation? There will be enough to put in a grand jury without jeopardizes the president.  That will be the true test.HANNITY: Wow. Pretty fascinating. This still is going to --PIRRO: Lot of stuff. Lot of legs.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And coming up next tonight here on ""Hannity"" --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and many other countries that horribly abuse women and the LGBT citizens.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump exposes Hillary Clinton's hypocrisy for taking millions of dollars from oppressive regimes while claiming to be the champion of human rights. Peter Johnson Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, they react next as HANNITY continues.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So earlier this week during his speech about Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump went after his Democratic rival for scandals dating back to her time at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. Let's watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund.  Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was secretary of state, plus millions more for her foundation.  Hillary took $25 million from Saudi Arabia and much more from others.  Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and many other countries that horribly abuse women and the LGBT citizens.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, earlier I spoke with Fox News legal analyst, Peter Johnson Jr., and ""The Five"" co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle about these Clinton scandals.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: I have been now hitting this hard for over a week both on radio and TV because how does somebody who claims to be a champion of women's rights take money from the Saudis and the Kuwatis and the UAE and Brunei and Qatar and Oman and Algeria that treat women, gays, lesbians, Christians and Jews horribly? How does she, they bought her silence. She never criticizes them.  KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": No, and she takes their jewels, too, and not to mention the dozens of foreign financiers that she also accepts money from. It really is just a blatant example, flagrant, of a pay for play. How can you say somebody wants to occupy the Oval and be the president of the United States, the commander in chief, who is really sullied with dirty money, money that flows from these people who are state sponsors of terrorism, who treat women abysmally, adultery, a woman that is raped and could be stoned to death or thrown off the tops of buildings or hung. She should be using this to take a stand to say I wouldn't accept money from people like this. I would return money. But instead --HANNITY: Donald Trump told me -- he told me last night, why won't she gave the money back?GUILFOYLE: Give the money back.HANNITY: She won't do it.Peter, I ask myself, on top of the money what does Clinton give in return?  Here's my two arguments one. She's never -- I've looked hard, I've researched everywhere. She's never criticized these countries and the practices of abuse against women, gays, lesbians, Christians and Jews.  She's never spoken out about it, great champion she is. And secondly, she's against coal, and drilling and fracking and energy independence.  That keeps them in business. Did they buy her silence? And did they buy her position on energy?PETER JOHNSON JR., FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: At the very best there is an apparent conflict of interest. At the very worst she and her husband were bought off by these dollars.And so what Donald Trump described was a mutual enrichment society, an international bazaar where the price of admission was contributions to the Clinton Foundation in order to get business in countries like Haiti, in countries like Kazakhstan, in order to say we now want to sell 20 percent of United States Uranium to Russia.HANNITY: The argument is that I've heard people on the left, their talking point is, oh, but the money is used for good things. But the money is coming from people that abuse, have atrocious human rights records.GUILFOYLE: It's called hypocrisy. It really is. And it's hypocrisy that is again for state sponsors of terrorism. When you look at 49 lives, the Orlando 49, and you see the steps that could have been taken to prevent that and you see the country, they're sponsoring terrorism that now is right here on our doorstep and on our soil, and this is an individual who completely lacks ethics and morality and integrity to serve this office.  And this is an example of it. When you follow the money, all roads lead to Clinton enrichment.HANNITY: Why does this country, is it because of the need for oil that we continue to suck up to the Saudis and other Middle Eastern countries? For example, the redacted pages of the 9/11 Commission report that we're told might implicate the Saudis in terms of financial support for some of the terrorists on 9/11, why wouldn't the public be able to see that?JOHNSON: I think you're giving even better motives than what we see here, what Donald Trump is talking about. You're talking about some public purpose causing us to act in some way. It appears to be more crass than a public service.HANNITY: It's about money.JOHNSON: That it's about money, about money for the foundation.HANNITY: Money buys silence?JOHNSON: About $750,000 speeches, about staying silent against the gay community, against discrimination involving women in the world. And so the revolving door of dollars and transactions and access and State Department policy changes in some of the most oppressive --HANNITY: Is this blood money?GUILFOYLE: Yes.HANNITY: Blood money?BOLDUAN: Yes. Trump said it. I think it is.JOHNSON: She needs to explain why it's not, because it gives appearance that it is.HANNITY: I am with Kimberly. I say blood money.GUILFOYLE: Look at the source.HANNITY: I wouldn't take a penny from them.JOHNSON: Yes, never, big time.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And coming up, we'll have more ""Hannity"" right after this break.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Now, unfortunately that's all the time we have left this evening. Before we go, quick programming note. Tune in Monday, 10:00 eastern, for a ""Hannity"" exclusive, the Secret Service agent, Gary Byrne, he was the guy stationed outside of Bill Clinton's Oval Office.  He exposes explosive new Clinton secrets and scandals. You can't afford to miss it. That's Monday at 10:00. We hope you'll join us.Thanks for being with us. Have a great weekend. We'll see you Monday night.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/08/11/obama-really-engaged-global-crises	Is Obama really engaged in the global crises?	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" August 8, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SHANNON BREAM, GUEST HOST: We are also learning tonight that the president has now officially notified the House of Representatives, sending an official breakdown of the actions he authorized in Iraq that he says are, quote, ""In the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.""Charles Krauthammer is a Fox News contributor, syndicated columnist and author of ""Things that Matter."" A book now enjoying its 10 months on the New York Times bestseller list, a great summer read.Charles, thanks for joining us tonight.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Pleasure.BREAM: What do you make of how the president is navigating this thus far?KRAUTHAMMER: Look, I'll give him credit for one half of the policy, which is to try to put great pressure on Baghdad to replace Maliki. That's what all the talk about unity government means, getting rid of him so that you can have some kind of government in Baghdad that is a reliable partner that will bring in Sunnis and Kurds.But that's completely different from what's happening in the north. And for the presidential spokeswoman to say, well, we're not going to do anything major, it all has to be done by Baghdad, all we're here is to help them to repel ISIS, that's ridiculous.There is nothing coming out of Baghdad. That army fell apart entirely at Mosul. The Kurds are really tough fighters. Peshmerga have held off a successive enemies for years. But they have no ammunition. They have very obsolete weapons. They're trying to hold a 600-mile front against ISIS on the move. And they could do it if they had the bullets. And Obama, this administration has refused to send them anything, saying it all has to go through Baghdad. And of course, anything we send to Baghdad never makes it to Kurdistan. The real issue here is, will we supply the Kurds with the weapons they need to fight ISIS and hold the line?And I also agree with the general -- just one more point. These are pinprick strikes. This is a 600 mile front. ISIS is an army on the move, very strong and armed now with all the weapons. Advanced American weapons it captured in Mosul. This cannot be done if you're going to have an air campaign, you're not going to hit an artillery piece there and a truck over there. That's preposterous. Either do it seriously or you don't do it at all.BREAM: And Charles, I have a good source who says that the Kurdish government and leaders there tried to put in an order with a U.S. manufacturer that could provide them ammunition and guns. But that company would need an export agreement from the State Department, they couldn't get it. Because the State Department apparently my understanding, if the indication is, it had to come through the Iraqi government. And, again, this deference to trying to keep the country together, to try to defer to a centralized Iraqi government. But the Kurds ordered that stuff months ago and couldn't get it. So where do we, you know, streamline the policy within this administration so that they can get the help without having to take that detour?KRAUTHAMMER: Here's a president, secretary of state, talking about potential genocide, which we can see happening in front of our eyes. Here's a friendly ally, the Kurds, whom in the '90s, a democratic president protected with airpower for a decade. Here are people who want to fight ISIS. And these ridiculous legalisms that this administration puts in the way of supplying them is simply incomprehensible. If a president gave the order tonight, we could have the weapons that the Kurds need, any tank weapons, and all kinds of low caliber stuff that they need, which is all they need, RPGs.If we could -- if the president gave the order, it could arrive from Germany where we have our supplies, within one day, and the idea that there are legalism. And here's what the president says and his spokesmen say. As you say, everything has to go through Baghdad. We know that the Baghdad government led by this Shiite chieftain, Maliki, has refused to give the Kurds anything since December 2013.The idea that all the aid has to go through Baghdad is really preposterous. It's a way of saying, we are not going to supply the Kurds. And they are there -- all they want is American help, not in the form of American troops, just the weaponry.After all, our weaponry is in the hands of ISIS. So, why not in the hands of the Kurds who will fight essentially on their behalf and on our behalf?BREAM: Charles, to be fair, this president did campaign on getting out of Iraq, getting out of Afghanistan. And he's been under a lot of pressure to do that. It seems that he personally, politics aside, his conviction was we didn't need to be there. We needed the transition out. But he also has the political pressure in addition to that.Now we're at the stage where we are with ISIS. What does he do? How does he -- is it possible for him to justify this to both sides of the aisle in a way that will allow him to do enough that could actually clean up this tragic disaster?KRAUTHAMMER: This is a president in the sixth year of his presidency. He will never have to run for reelection again. If he allows himself to make the great decisions of our time -- and this is a large decision -- if ISIS succeeds in Kurdistan, it can and will probably succeed everywhere else. And then we are going to have a radical Islamist State that Al Qaeda has ex-communicated because of its savagery, in charge. If he has to make those decisions on the grounds of politics, this country is in deep trouble.BREAM: Charles, always good to see you. Thank you, sir.KRAUTHAMMER: Pleasure.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.Hillary's new capital gains tax planCharles Payne: It's mind-boggling. The whole speech she laid out was absolutely mind-boggling. The notion she's going to get individual investors not to trade because they'll be punished for it, let me tell you something, this week a lot of individual investors were pleased for trading because they sold Netflix at a loss a year ago, sold amazon and Facebook. They probably should trading as much. The notion she should punish people and somehow punish organizations and she should make them do more things with their money, I'm telling you, the bottom line is that the welfare utopia has run out of money, only one place to get it, the corporate balance sheet. All this stuff leads to the same thing. Under the guise of conscious capitalism they want that money.Dagen McDowell: I didn't understand the -- i didn't understand the stock buybacks were so evil either. She not only is running for president of the United States, she's running for CEO of America because she's going to tell everybody how to invest their money and everybody how to manage their finances. HRC Capital Management is what she wants to turn the United States into.Charles Gasparino: I don't know whether to hate you for more making me listen to that or hate Larry Fink at black rock for giving her dopey ideas about short term -- listen, this is purely politics. It makes no sense. She needs a Wall Street whipping boy. She can't beat up on Goldman Sachs because they give her -- they actually paid her money to listen to her speak like that, by the way. That should be a shareholder revolt at Goldman Sachs. They can't -- she can't beat up on them or private equity because they pay her money too. They should be, you know, Blackstone should be in big trouble with their shareholders.Adam Lashinsky: As political analysis goes, it's lot bad. She said if you're a traitor, if you're a hair-trigger trader and go in and out of these stocks that's your job. That's like income.Gary Kaltbaum: It won't work. If people want to sell tomorrow, they'll sell tomorrow. This is trying to engineer people. But, look, there is a bigger picture here. This is indicative of the shape of things to come under Hillary Clinton. Notice higher taxes. It's not just going to be this; it's going to be other things. Notice people like Kasich, lower taxes, keep money in the private sector, keep it away from the government. Hillary Clinton is the opposite and it hurts economic growth.Secret side deals with Iran are coming to lightCharles Payne: And unfortunately we probably learned all of it the hard way. I guess what's most frustrating about it is the administration's telling us shut up and accept it. Shut up and accept it. We trust -- we trust Iran. Even though we're saying we don't.Charlie Gasparino: The whole thing is disconcerting. So obvious, to your point, we trust, not we, but the Obama administration trusts Iran more than they trust the American people or Congress. They don't trust the people they're supposed to trust.Dagen McDowell: We are fools for thinking otherwise. Of course this is going to happen with Iran. We're getting into bed with the nation that calls us the great Satan. A week ago the supreme leader in Iran called the U.S., After the deal was done, arrogant, and in the crowd chants, ""death to America, death to Israel."" Then the secretary of state absolutely shocked and said, well, I told them don't about that way.Gary Kaltbaum: It's another case of we only know what they want us to know and simply another case where the most transparent administration in is in really the least.Adam Lashinsky: Of course. Everything is worrisome. The cup half full analysis that I can offer is you started the segment saying we've learned. How have we learned? Because we have a media looking into it.New York raises minimum wage to $15 an hourDagen McDowell: You're going to pay more. It's going to hurt business and it's also going to hurt job creation. You see, particularly seeing in San Francisco and Los Angeles just raised the minimum wage and Los Angeles County wants to do the same thing to $15 over a period.Charles Payne: Bottom line, Chipotle has people who will buy that stuff. McDonald's, traffic is down. Job killer that will kill jobs and make it more expensive for poor people to even go get a Big Mac somewhere and it's a double whammy.Charlie Gasparino: That's the point that Hillary Clinton made on Friday about, she brought up Chipotle and I think it's absurd. You need more traffic in these places and, I tell you, people will cut back on certain things if they can't afford it.Adam Lashinsky: The liberals have the same eating characteristics. They wouldn't be caught dead in one of these places. Am I right? You would not go to any of these places under any circumstances. At the margins some people might feel better that an employer treats its employees better so I'll go there. I don't think any one of these things is the single factor.Gary Kaltbaum: Let me take another side here. Youth unemployment in New York State is already 21 percent. These are your 16 to 19 year olds. They are going to be losing their jobs and the shame of it is, the franchisees are the trainers of these people to get into the workforce and no better business. This is going to be damages across the board, higher costs, you name it, everything.Stock PicksCharles Payne: TRNAdam Lashinksy: OEFBen Stein: Visa"	['Israel', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	['creation']
7	7	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/11/23/are-intel-manipulation-claims-symptom-deeper-problem/	Are intel manipulation claims a symptom of a deeper problem?	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" November 23, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they think they would do, present us a specific plan. If they think that somehow their advisers are better than the chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff and the folks who are actually on the ground, I want to meet them.So to the extent that it's been shaded, again, I don't know the details of what the I.G. may discover, but it feels to me like at my level, at least, we've had a pretty clear-eyed, sober assessment of where we've made real progress and where we have not.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, the White House says today the president is not afraid of getting bad news. But it may be bad news as the Defense Department expands the investigation into possibly cooking the books on intel about the situation with ISIS.This comes as breaking news at the top of the show. The State Department releases a worldwide warning for U.S. citizens. The State Department alerts U.S. citizens to possible risks of travel due to increased terrorist threats. Current information suggests that ISIL, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, and other terrorist groups continue to plan terrorist attacks in multiple regions.Now this also comes as new FOX polls show how people are feeling out there. The Obama administration on ISIS -- this is not the one we're looking for. We're looking for poll number five. The Obama administration on ISIS not aggressive enough, now, and this is one of the most important issues facing the country.You know what, I'm going to bring in the panel because that's where we're looking at, Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, Robert Costa, national political reporter for The Washington Post, and Juan Williams, columnist with The Hill. Barring my poll calling there, Steve, what about this investigation into, and how serious is this? In what we have seen before, Fox first reported the story a ways back.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes. We've been sort of all over this for a long time.Look, there are three different investigations or discussions of investigation. There is the ongoing Pentagon inspector general investigation which is looking, as far as we can tell, at manipulation intelligence related to ISIS based on the Cent Com. There is some discussion, I talked to some people today, who believe that Pentagon inspector general investigation is expanded to include the manipulation of intelligence on Afghanistan as well.What the president was talking about was a second investigation, another investigation that he wants to look at the manipulation of intelligence or potential manipulation of intelligence. I would submit that that won't be a very serious investigation because I think the manipulation of intelligence has been happening at the behest of the White House, and potentially at the direction of the White House.There is a third investigation that Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has been basically conducting now for several years. He was one of the first members of Congress to be looking seriously at allegations of manipulating intelligence on the Usama bin Laden documents. They've made some head way on that. I think Nunes properly sees that as part of this latest investigation.So the ISIS scandal investigation that we're talking about now is really a symptom of a deeper problem, and you've had senior U.S. officials on the record, Mike Flynn, former head of the DIA, Derek Harvey who ran CENTCOM's Afghanistan-Pakistan unit, senior U.S. officials say on the record that this intelligence manipulation was happening. It's quite serious.BAIER: Nunes was here a week ago tonight. I asked him about this investigation and the disconnect between the administration and intel on ISIS.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIF.: I think at a minimum it seems like the White House is surrounding themselves with a bunch of yes men, because when members of my committee, on the intelligence committee, we go out and visit these countries or meet with analysts, we always get a different picture that is painted for us than what we see in final product that's produced or in what the president and his advisers are saying on national television.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: The chairman of the House intelligence committee. Robert?ROBERT COSTA, THE WASHINGTON POST: Nunes is an important figure to watch because he's close to Speaker Ryan and he's having the endorsement and the support of the speaker to pursue this. And you see a lot of House Republicans and Senate Republicans taking Nunes' line. There is a lot of concern about what the president is hearing from his advisers. I was just in Iowa over the weekend and saw seven presidential candidates. When especially I heard Senator Rubio and Senator Cruz and others speak out, they're talking about the information the president is getting. So not only is this a rising issue on Capitol Hill, but it is a big issue on the campaign trail.BAIER: Steve mentioned Mike Flynn, Lieutenant General Flynn. I talked to him months ago about the disconnect with the administration and intel. Take a look at this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So your conclusions, your assumptions, were not tracking with what was coming out publicly with the Obama administration?LT. GEN. MICHAEL FLYNN (RET), FORMER DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY DIRECTOR: They were no longer assumptions. They were facts. You couldn't look at the facts as they were with the size, scale, numbers of organizations, the network that we saw, the thickening of lines between different groups, groups in Pakistan, groups in Yemen, groups in east Africa, groups in the Maghreb, the Mali area. And factually we knew that those lines were thicker and those organizations were more robust. What I know the intelligence said was not necessarily what we hear.BAIER: It was diametrically opposed, wasn't it?FLYNN: I would say from my perspective it was just the opposite.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: The former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Juan.JUAN WILLIAMS, THE HILL: Well, this is just a scandalous kind of development because you have to have good intelligence -- I don't care which political party you belong to -- in order to conduct a successful, effective strategy and military operation. Without information in the age we live in, you are running blind and it's ineffective.And we've seen this before. We've seen it obviously with the weapons of mass destruction argument back in the Bush administration when you had obviously people talking about, CIA people talking about it's going to be a slam-dunk with regard to weapons of mass destruction, or the Defense Department, the Pentagon, saying we know the way around Tikrit and all the rest, and they didn't. They didn't know where things were. That tells you how serious this is. I don't care about the politics of it.It does open the question, though, exactly whether or not this is being engineered by the Obama administration specifically, pressure coming from the president and his top aides and the National Security Council. That would be Susan Rice. So Steve says, oh, you think it does have some connect to the White House specifically. I don't see that we've jumped that bridge yet, but I do think what we're dealing with here is the question about intelligence gathering that has dogged the United States now for a decade.BAIER: Which is problematic. I'm going to try these polls again. Number nine, Obama's plan for the U.S. to accept 10,000-plus Syrian refugees over the next year, favor is at 28 percent, opposed is at 27 percent. It sounds really good. It's better if you could see it.FOX 10, the poll, likelihood of at least one Syrian refugee who comes to the U.S. to carry out an attack, there you go, and there you see breakdown by the party. There is concern here, Steve, about the refugee issue, and it seems like the White House is disconnected on that issue as well.HAYES: The White House would rather have a different argument. I think the White House now would rather have a discussion on gun control. But I think what you're seeing reflected on these poll numbers is the American public in a sense catching up to what a lot of senior intelligence officials has been.And to go back to Juan's point, I think there is a pattern from this White House. I think you're right, we need to wait ask find out exactly what the White House was saying, if the White House was in fact ordering manipulation of intelligence or putting pressure. We need to find that out. But there is also a distinct pattern from the White House of downplaying this threat that stretches back to the days even before President Obama was elected. And if you look at things like the response to the Christmas day attempted bombing attack, when the president calls Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab an isolated extremist despite the fact that the FBI has already learned that he was sent by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, you can go forward and plot a number of these responses from the White House that suggests the president just wasn't interested in the facts.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.
