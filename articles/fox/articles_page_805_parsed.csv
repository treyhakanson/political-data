1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/03/16/donald-trump-riot-warning/	Donald Trump's riot warning	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 16, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hello. I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, and she sneeze rainbows and butterflies -- Dana Perino, ""The Five.""This morning on another network I will not mention -- CNN -- Donald Trump said that a contested convention would be super awesome:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think we'll win before getting to the convention but I can tell you, if we didn't and if we're 20 votes short or if we're, if we're, you know, a hundred short, and we're at 1,100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400, because we're way ahead of everybody, I don't think you can say that we don't get it automatically. I think it would be -- I think you would have riots. I think you would have riots.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I must have misheard. He said there will be riots, twice.Now maybe he didn't mean it or maybe he did. It probably doesn't matter. But we should be consistent. After all, if we bash radicals for inciting unrest if their demands are met, we should probably do that here.But I am not worried. Who would Trump supporters riot against? I can't see them destroying businesses, because either they work in them or they own them. They don't tip over cop cars or heave rocks at fire trucks because they're likely to be cops or firemen themselves. They would never throw a chair through a window, because that chair cost them 75 bucks at Crate and Barrel. Law-abiding people abide by laws. They aren't occupying Wall Street, they occupy Main Streets.But what of the candidate, that kinder, gentler one we keep hearing about? Trump's comment reveals that he's aware that he has a faithful army and it must be really good knowing these people are there and willing to fight for you and stick by you even if you shoot someone on Fifth Avenue. But being an actual leader means not abusing power, but humbly respecting it. Suggesting lawlessness even off-hand in response to a lawful, but unpopular event isn't very presidential. And even though a movement can indeed feel really exciting, we must not shed our scruples in service of a phenomenon. America already did that once in 2008.All right, Juan. Will there be riots if there is a contested convention? Yes or no. I'm doing my McLaughlin report.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Is that --GUTFELD: Yes or no?WILLIAMS: I would say --DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Pretty good.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Yeah.WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: Wrong.GUTFELD: That's wrong.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: There will be riots.WILLIAMS: There will be riots? OK.GUTFELD: No -- if that's happens, I mean, there will be anger but there won't be riots, will there?WILLIAMS: I don't know. Look, what we saw last Friday, look like riots is behavior.GUTFELD: But that was between --PERINO: Not has not --GUTFELD: That was between two different factions...PERINO: Yeah.GUTFELD: ... or road tester.WILLIAMS: But that's what's going on.GUTFELD: No --WILLIAMS: I mean two different factions of republicans.PERINO: No.GUTFELD: Do republicans rioting against republicans? They're going to be throwing their golf bags at each other.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: You know if they bought riot gear, the Cleveland police have bought riot gear now.GUTFELD: Really?WILLIAMS: Yeah, just last week. I saw it.PERINO: But that wasn't because of an intraparty fight --WILLIAMS: No. That was they say...PERINO: That was because of --WILLIAMS: ... the liberals, right?GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: They're for liberals.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: Well --WILLIAMS: I see. Always blame the liberals. But let me just tell you, Trump is not calling on liberals to riot. He is calling on his supporters.BOLLING: No, no --PERINO: He is not saying riot.BOLLING: He didn't call on anyone. No, he didn't call anyone to riot...WILLIAMS: Oh no.BOLLING: ... he said, I think there could be riots.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Oh yeah. I don't know who. Who would do such a thing?BOLLING: Well I --WILLIAMS: I don't know.BOLLING: First of all, for the record, I don't think there's not going to be contested convention.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: I just don't think it's going to come down to the math. After last night when Rubio got out after a thorough trumping, thumping of the field last night by Trump, the delegate match goes very, very strongly in his favor for him to earn at least the 1237 if not more. If even you just take what he's done in the past...WILLIAMS: Can I -- can I interrupt?BOLLING: ... take it forward. Sure.WILLIAMS: Let me interrupt.BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Let me just tell one of Dana's corny jokes. But this is, since it's third, you know, let's take some magic --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Let some magic Thursday and throwback Thursday. What's black, white and read all over?GUTFELD: What?BOLLING: A Newspaper.WILLIAMS: It's a newspaper.BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: And so, and today's Wall Street Journal headline was something to this effect; hard for Trump to clinch nomination before convention, he have to win half --BOLLING: Because I --WILLIAMS: ... or the remaining delegates --BOLLING: Right, right.WILLIAMS: They don't see that that's possible.BOLLING: No, no, but here's the deal --KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: He slept here, your whiteboard last night.BOLLING: OK, I love The Wall Street Journal. I love The Wall Street Journal and they're part of the campaign. I get it. But they're completely wrong on this one.WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: There are 48 percent of the delegates have been won by Trump already, but he's won 65 percent of the contest. Why is that matter? Because going forward, there are 11 winner take all, or winner take most, and there are only six proportional. So these -- the delegates are heavily weighted to winner take all and winner takes most. And if you just do the math with Rubio already in and 17 others in and apply it forward, he gets the 1,300. If you take Rubio out of the math, he gets even higher than 1,300. So -- but no one -- they're not, look -- they don't want to look at it that way, in their defense.GUTFELD: Do you think, though? Dana, do you think it is important? I mean - - that Trump measures his words as he becomes more and more likely the nominee? And the fact that it only takes one nut to listen to him and do something stupid. It wouldn't be his fault but, you know, we're having this discontent in other areas. Should he be more careful?PERINO: Well, I don't think that this morning -- I don't think he was suggesting...GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: ... that there should be a riot. I think that...GUTFELD: No.PERINO: ... he was just saying, what could possibly happen? And because there hasn't been a contested convention in so long, nobody knows what it would be like.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: And I think -- if there were to be a contested convention, it would be a big fight. And there will ad in social media and tactics and strategy, unlike anything we have ever seen.GUTFELD: Well, will we be doing midnight shows?WILLIAMS: Oh.PERINO: I hope so, because --BOLLING: We're going to be there.PERINO: I mean I was on fire.GUTFELD: Yes, that right.BOLLING: We are going to be there, right?PERINO: I was on fire last night because --WILLIAMS: You're on fire?PERINO: Yeah, I mean I was so awake. It was amazing.WILLIAMS: Oh.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. We're going to be like the RNC.PERINO: But I do think, and also, let's say that -- let say that, if Eric is correct on the math, then this is, this conversation is moot. If it does to go a contested convention and then -- whoever is going to be in the lead at the time, if it comes down to these three, let's just Cruz, Trump and Kasich. Then yes, all three leaders need to say, understand the passion. I think we have a good plan. Let's go in and win this thing and nobody needs to fight about it. I agree with you. I don't think the republicans are going to have republican on republican actual violence.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: I don't believe that one.GUTFELD: Yeah. It will be -- the khakis everywhere.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Golf stuff flying.GUILFOYLE: It will be like a (inaudible), right?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Let me ask you about the other protests.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: There are these anti-Trump groups; they're threatening the largest civil disobedience action of the century. Of course, there is democracy spring. It looks like its George Soros, funded -- there's the surprise.GUILFOYLE: Shocking.GUTFELD: A Moveon.org, institute for policies that is demos, or is it demonic, I'm not sure.GUILFOYLE: Right. They'll throw Bill Ayers in there.GUTFELD: Should we be worried about at this?GUILFOYLE: Look, that's to be expected, right? Because they've already been trying to disenfranchise people who want to gather to listen to the candidate of their choice, showing up in Chicago, trying to shut down free speech. But oh, those are the liberals doing that, because anytime the speech that they don't agree with and they want to shut it down. So there's the whole double standard of hypocrisy there. Let me just circle back really quick four days ago about Donald Trump. Yeah, I don't think he is going take it lightly, but also the people who are supporting him wouldn't want him to take it lightly. They would want him to stand up and be an advocate for himself to say listen, the people have spoken, the actual voters, not just delegates. The people have decided and it has come out in record numbers to decide and have put a lot of support (inaudible) -- yes, Mr. Trump, behind Ted Cruz, absolutely. So yeah, if I were Ted Cruz or I were Donald Trump, and I would have the most, you know, votes going in there, I would expect to be able to receive the nomination from the party.WILLIAMS: But you understand that the rules. I mean the rules, 1237.GUILFOYLE: I understand that. But I would also not expect for somebody who maybe won one state or no states, to be able to go in and get appointed like we're in some kind of bizarre monarchy, because those are not the principles of the country was founded on.WILLIAMS: No, no. Nobody is saying monarchy. It's just the rules of the -- the rules of a convention are, you have to have a certain number of delegates, in order to win the nomination outright.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. I get how it works.WILLIAMS: And right, you know, we're making fun of all these liberal group that's might come in. And we're worried, but not too worried about Trump calling for riots among his supporters. But the fact is there is a large segment of republican voters who don't want Trump.BOLLING: Do you know the last time a candidate who wasn't leading going into a contested convention, actually became the nominee?GUILFOYLE: The 1948?BOLLING: 1940.GUILFOYLE: Oh, 40.PERINO: Great year.BOLLING: Seventy-seven years ago.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: I mean our grandparents were kids at the time. I mean, Juan --WILLIAMS: The rules haven't changed.BOLLING: No, the rules are there. But to not to --WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: Listen to what Kimberly is saying here, life has changed, too. The people want a voice, and the reason why Donald Trump has become such a thing...GUILFOYLE: Populous thing.BOLLING: ... the 48 percent of the votes, 65 percent of the states. It's because people expect their voice to be heard. If they think they're voting for a candidate and it gets to the rules committee and it change at the convention, the rules committee can change the game at the convention to pick whoever they want. If that happens, I agree...WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, wait, wait.BOLLING: ... Donald Trump is probably -- wait.WILLIAMS: They're cannot --BOLLING: There will be protests.WILLIAMS: They're not --BOLLING: And there will be lie in the protest.WILLIAMS: But they're not changing the rules --BOLLING: You just -- no, no. You can --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: No, no, you can't.GUILFOYLE: They can.BOLLING: No, no --WILLIAMS: Oh you say they can?BOLLING: You can change the rules...WILLIAMS: Yes, they could.BOLLING: ... at convention.WILLIAMS: But I'm saying the current rules are the rule.BOLLING: Yeah, who's going to say -- so why you change the rules and say, you know what, we don't need 1237 now. Now you need 1350 and it has to be a super majority.WILLIAMS: No, no.BOLLING: Oh no, they can.WILLIAMS: You're saying this will be outlawed type -- I'm just saying if you're a republican --BOLLING: Well, how it is not outlawed if anyone knows --WILLIAMS: Just play the rules of the rules?GUILFOYLE: Appeal the vote.WILLIAMS: They're not --BOLLING: If the people have voted for a candidate...WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: ... in an overwhelming of states, and delegates, and votes. He's not the candidate -- he's not the nominee.WILLIAMS: But let me just say things can change in a moment. Right now we know and we saw this last night, even as Trump was doing extremely well, Eric, most of the late deciders were going against him.BOLLING: Oh, he can.WILLIAMS: Right?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: So that's the voice of the people too.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: The voice of republican people.BOLLING: I'm waiting to hear the first groups of a pundit who said -- who has been, just trashing what's going on with the Trump organic pressures...GUILFOYLE: Phenomenon.BOLLING: ... to start walking him back. Start softening the tone, to start -- you'll know maybe, you know -- it's going to happen anytime. And I think after last night, you're going to start hearing it right now.GUILFOYLE: And by the way, Ted Cruz --BOLLING: And clearly, Juan is not one of them.GUILFOYLE: Ted Cruz is one of your top constitutional lawyers in the country which also, I think right be there, standing by Cruz, or you know by Trump or, you know, standing up for himself if they were to try and deny constitutionally the ability to be able to go in and have those delegates. I mean --WILLIAMS: I think -- don't you think Cruz is going to be contesting? He wants to win.GUILFOYLE: Cruz is in the same position as Donald Trump.GUTFELD: Well, can I --GUILFOYLE: He is.GUTFELD: I want to move on to this --GUILFOYLE: One of the two of them will be the nominee.GUTFELD: This is Trump on ""Fox and Friends."" He was talking about what would happen if there would be a third party. I think he is for it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The third party will mean an absolute total victory for the democrats. It will mean four or five very liberal judges, and the country will never be the same. You'll never recover. That will be the end of the country as you know it. That will be a disaster.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I have to look at these sot's before I present them. Dana, what do you make of that?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: Just practically, for a third party to actually get on the ballot. I think you have to get some crazy number. It's almost 100,000 signatures in three weeks...GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: ... from today. I mean, it's almost --GUTFELD: Yeah. Unless you --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I again, I just think it is a hypothetical...GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: ... that we don't need to worry about now, because I actually don't think it's going to happen.GUTFELD: Yeah. Unless you're trying to get somebody fired from like America's Got Talent. You will never get like 100,000 people to sign anything. It's always -- petitions only work in the entertainment industry -- I suppose.GUILFOYLE: And Bloomberg studies are not running.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: And you have to find a way to...GUTFELD: Gadget.PERINO: ... still fund it. And I just -- I think that it is a moot point as well.GUTFELD: Boom, you said moot point twice. I think you're working --PERINO: Double moot.GUTFELD: I think you're working your way towards a banned phrase.PERINO: Just mute me.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: According to this nomination poll, if Trump has the most delegates going to the republican convention but not enough to win the majority on the first ballot, do you think he should win the nomination? 53 percent said he should, and 42 percent said he shouldn't, and 5 percent said no opinion; that was an ABC poll. So there you go.GUILFOYLE: Well they --GUTFELD: The people have spoken.GUILFOYLE: They just got it up.GUTFELD: Yeah. All right, coming -- coming up --(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: After last night's big victory, it's looking more like a Trump versus Clinton showdown in November. But can Donald actually beat Hillary? That debate, next.(LAUGHTER)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are one step closer to facing off in the general election. Trump has been sounding off on his likely competitor, recently. And again, last night, following his big primary wins.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I haven't even started on her yet. The one person she does not want to run against is me; that I can tell you. She is an embarrassment to our country. She is under federal investigation. She doesn't have the strength or the stamina to be president.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And the GOP front-runner ramping up his attacks, just take a look at this new Instagram video he put out, today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Hillary doesn't seem fazed. Here's what she says about going head- to-head with Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I've gotten more votes than anybody, including Donald Trump and 600,000 more. And I think I'm ready to take him on if he is in that, you know, in that position.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So who would win? According to the latest polls, Hillary, a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll has Clinton leading Trump by 13 points. A Washington Post/ABC survey shows Clinton ahead by nine, and Rasmussen has Hillary ahead by five points. Now Dana, you said if you have some interesting points?PERINO: No, I just think that there's room for optimism if you're -- whoever the republican nominee is. But if you're Donald Trump, in particular, if you look at the turnouts from last night, remember at the midnight show we didn't actually have these numbers. But in Florida, they had, let me make just make sure I'm right. They had 3.9 million Floridians vote yesterday. That is up by about half a million that from over 2012. For republic -- and the democrats did not at all come near that, it was like 35 percent of the people from 2012. So there's some enthusiasm on both sides. But if you're looking at the must-win state of Florida, and how decisive it was for Donald Trump in Florida, I think that if you're in the Trump camp, you would have a lot of optimism looking at that state, in particular, because these national polls in the head-to-head, they're important and interesting. But when it comes down to the seven swing states, the head - to-head in those states are more important. Not -- it's not all good news for Donald Trump on that, front, in particular, but I would for -- in terms of turnout, in those important states, Florida being one of the most important ones, he had a significant edge last night.BOLLING: Coming to one more data, if 2008, the last time it was uncontested, to 2016, the republicans are one that are ups now, the latest numbers, 61 percent...PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: ... in turnout, 61 percent in turnout. So for every 10, there are six additional. And on the democrat side, you're down by 23 percent down.GUILFOYLE: Oh.WILLIAMS: So I would say, I would say --GUILFOYLE: Sorry.WILLIAMS: I must tell you that, I think the republicans debates, the republican campaign has been fast. I mean it's like, it is, literally, real life TV -- whatever, reality TV. It's fascinating, and Donald Trump, what a leading character. It's amazing. Do I think, if you're just a casual observer of politics and you're tuning in, I think you would be -- the republican primary would galvanize you, but would grab your attention, get more people involve. But I must tell you that historically, it just -- it doesn't pan out in terms of general election turnout. And don't forget, even --BOLLING: Well, can you just clarify that?WILLIAMS: Sure. That it doesn't translate, that you may get a Russian meatball --BOLLING: But do you have any proof of that?WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.GUILFOYLE: But they never had these numbers before.WILLIAMS: Historically --BOLLING: You've never had a 61 percent increase --WILLIAMS: No, I'm saying historically, when you see a huge difference in turnout during the primary and the caucus season, it doesn't translate into the turnout during the general election.BOLLING: They'll be suggesting that people will show up for the primary and...PERINO: And not.BOLLING: ... record numbers --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: And then become like this --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I'm good.WILLIAMS: Well, no. That --GUILFOYLE: Now, I'm good.WILLIAMS: But the reason would be, and especially in this case, there are so many republicans who are not Trump supporters. So if Trump is the nominee, not only that. There are so many people who are strongly anti- Trump who would be energized on the other side. So it's going to be --PERINO: But according to this, and then I'll shut up. But according to my friend, even if all the Sanders supporters voted for Hillary, more than half of all the non-Trump republican voters would have to stay home for Clinton to win the state. So the numbers are really overwhelmingly and positive on the republican side in Florida on this date.GUILFOYLE: Flop that on the white board --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah -- no, but she's right. Because it comes down to the seven swing states, and when you look at Florida, and last night Trump was alluding to this about all the poll workers. They've never seen a turnout like this. You have to take that state. You have to take Ohio if you want to win the presidency of the United States. So when you factor that in -- and again, look at Hillary, the barking dog response, that's going to be the choice and the alternative. Maybe people are gonna come around to, maybe they take little (inaudible) and go. You know what? Actually, I don't want her picking the next U.S. Supreme Court justice.BOLLING: Greg, you want this or you want to talk about David Plouffe?GUTFELD: No, I want to talk about this. I -- we-- OK, Superman versus Batman is -- the movie is coming out March 25th. And Batman embarks on a vendetta against Superman. Trump versus Hillary is actually Superman versus Batman for people who don't wear sweats all day. I mean, you can -- this could be really, really, really ugly, but we all want to see it. We want to see it. It's going to be Popeye versus Bluto, Rocky versus Apollo Creed. And I don't think, I don't think it's helpful for Trump to play down the polls. You got to act like you're behind, so you can fight hard. You don't want to take anything for granted.GUILFOYLE: All right. And, but the thing is, he says I haven't started going after her and, you know, taking hits. We saw a little bit of that today with the video. When you think about it, which republican candidate is going to actually get after her very aggressively? I don't -- Trump will.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: ... into a victim.GUILFOYLE: Cruz will.GUTFELD: Because he's going on relish, turning her into a misogynist, right? That's what she's going to do.BOLLING: But that's --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: She doesn't seem so hopeless or helpless.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: That doesn't burden.PERINO: I didn't --BOLLING: The more of that seems to --PERINO: I don't know --BOLLING: Seems to --PERINO: Well --BOLLING: Help him.PERINO: That might be true for some voters, but I do think that when you look at, remember just last week, we had that last stat that republican women who are 37 percent approval rating for Trump in January. Last week we're down to 24 percent in the first week of March. That is a slide that he can't continue to have. So he has to figure out a way to turn that around. So that delegate balance -- well, he doesn't do delicate --WILLIAMS: Let me just -- let me just add to there --GUILFOYLE: You have to get back together. You got to romance them. You got to bring the ladies back.WILLIAMS: Well let me get -- yeah. Let me got to say...GUILFOYLE: It's going to be hard.PERINO: He's got to do it.WILLIAMS: ... so the Washington Post/ABC --GUILFOYLE: Have to.WILLIAMS: Trump loses women to Hillary Clinton, plus 21 percent. And millennials, millennials voters under 35. He loses by more than 33 points. I mean --BOLLING: You're talking to Clinton?WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: This is eight months away.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: That's all we had -- all we can do. We can't project, though.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Do you remember eight months prior to this date who was winning on the GOP side? Trump was polling high, but he was losing head-to-head to everybody. Every single republican candidate he was losing to with the exception of what was that one guy, Gilmore?GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: Maybe he was winning.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Did he ever drop out?BOLLING: Is he still in?WILLIAMS: No.PERINO: No, he dropped out. He dropped out.GUTFELD: I'm kidding.WILLIAMS: We're not going to get to David Plouffe.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I just want to tell you something that the democrats, David Plouffe, of course was a key adviser to President Obama, especially in '08 his campaign manager. And Plouffe said, oh my gosh, if Trump gets in, nobody knows what he'll do. He's like, you like, you know, unpredictable.PERINO: That's the wild card.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: And he could do anything. And he might be the biggest threat to Hillary Clinton.GUILFOYLE: That's what I was referencing yesterday.BOLLING: And a leader -- right there, KG. Directly ahead, precedents someone, Obama makes his pick to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court, setting of what promises to be a partisan showdown on Capitol Hill - - details on the nomination when we return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Some big news today with President Obama announcing his choice to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: After completing this exhausted process, I've made my decision. I've selected nominee who is widely recognize, not only as one of America's sharpest legal minds, but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency, modesty, integrity, even handedness and excellence. Today, I am nominating Chief Judge Merrick Brian Garland to join the Supreme Court.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Judge Garland, a long time federal appeals court judge was emotional while accepting the president's nomination to our nation's highest court.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MERRICK BRIAN GARLAND, CHIEF JUDGE: Thank you, Mr. President. This is the greatest honor of my life -- other than my wife agreeing to marry me 28 years ago. It's also the greatest gift I've ever received except, and there is another caveat, the birth of our daughters, Jessie and Becky. Mr. President, it's a great privilege to be nominated by a fellow Chicagoan. I am grateful beyond words for the honor you have bestowed upon me.(APPLAUSE)GARLAND: Thank you.OBAMA: Congratulations.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS:  The president's move is setting up what's likely to be a brutal election-year battle with Senate Republicans.  Kimberly...GUILFOYLE:  I knew it.  WILLIAMS:  ... you understand...GUILFOYLE:  Yes.WILLIAMS:  ... a little bit about the tension here.  Senate Republicans so far holding tight, saying they will not grant a hearing to Judge Garland.  GUILFOYLE:  And they said that without consideration for who, in fact, the candidate would be.  Right?  They're saying, as a general principle, that they believe that the next Supreme Court justice should, as a matter of fact, be decided by the next president of the United States.  That plays both ways.  If Hillary Clinton wins, she gets to pick.  If one of the Republicans wins -- Cruz, Kasich, Trump -- then they would get to pick.  Having done a lot of research about the background of the candidates before today's, you know, speech by the president and nominating this individual, he's a very highly regarded.  And in fact, I think would be a good choice except for this, you know, time frame of what's going on.  Because I find that he's actually much more consistent with being a constitutionalist than say, for example, Sotomayor or Elena Kagan.  This, in fact, might be the best that the Republicans could hope for, because I'll tell you what.   Hillary Clinton, if she gets in, I guarantee you is going to pick somebody more liberal than this individual.  WILLIAMS:  So you would advise the Senate Republicans...GUILFOYLE:  I think it's a very, very tough game of Russian roulette.  WILLIAMS:  You're a good chess player, though.  What do you...BOLLING:  I think they need to chess play this out completely.  I agree with Kimberly: as far as nominees go, he would be the most centrist that you could hope for, but I think this is a little politics being played by President Obama, knowing that the Senate Republicans won't do it; they've said they won't do it.  So he put his most centrist possible pick up there, so that when they don't do it, he can say, ""See, the Republicans are playing politics.""  Unfortunately, he's the pawn in this political game.  GUILFOYLE:  Yes.BOLLING:  So therefore, here's what I would do.  GUILFOYLE:  What?BOLLING:  I would slow walk it.  I would give a hearing.  I would say we're not ready yet, have another hearing.  Slow walk it until you find out who's going to be the next president.  If you're going to get Hillary Clinton...GUILFOYLE:  Take him.BOLLING:  Take him.  Confirm him immediately.  If not, slow walk it again and say, ""Listen, we're going to let the people decide with the next president.""  WILLIAMS:  Well, Dana, I want to ask you: what do you think about the idea that he was confirmed by large majorities of both parties in the past.  And we've seen presidents, Republicans, you know, I think in the '80s, Reagan had Kennedy -- right? -- in his last year.  So what exactly is the strongest possible Republican argument for not allowing him to go forward?PERINO:  They might use The New York Times headline which is, ""A Supreme Court with Merrick Garland would be the most liberal in decades.""  You could start there if you're Republican.  I think that they're under no obligation.  And I like that Senate Majority Leader today Mitch McConnell said, ""Mr. President, we're going to use the Biden rule.""  The Biden rule was, let's not confirm anybody in a political year.  I mean, it's hard to argue against the Biden rule if you're at the White House.  So there's that.I also think, though, that they're playing a little bit of Russian roulette or American roulette.  Because if Hillary Clinton becomes the nominee, and the Republicans lose the Senate, because a president usually brings in whoever on their coattails, then they're playing kind of a dangerous game.  But I also think that there has been somebody like Miguel Estrada, eminently qualified judge who could not get confirmed because of politics on the Democratic side.  So it's parity, in some ways.  It's politics in a lot of ways, but I also think that it's the most important thing you can do as a president when you leave this legacy.  President Obama has already had two.  President George W. Bush had two.  And just looking at the make-up of the Supreme Court now, you could see several more in the next few years.  GUILFOYLE:  Yes, yes.WILLIAMS:  So Greg, it's like that movie, ""The Big Payback.""  Is that James Brown?  I think it's James Brown.GUTFELD:  I have no idea.  OK.  A couple of things.  About the confirmation process, Obama says that he doesn't want to make it about divisive politics, which is Obama for ""Please agree with me.""  He also said that the judge is prepared to serve immediately.  So I asked why is the rush?  Is the court going to turn into a pumpkin?  The rule of thumb, when you're trying to buy a car or if somebody is trying to sell you anything, if someone is rushing you to make a decision, they are hiding something.  So what are they hiding about this guy?  He's incredibly left-wing about guns.  They're going to portray him as safe and as a centrist, but he voted against the right to keep a gun in your house for defense in Washington, D.C., where you should have a gun in your house.  So they're trying to portray him as boring.  They're trying to portray him as a centrist, but he's fundamentally against individual freedoms when it comes to protecting yourself and your family.  GUILFOYLE:  Well, there's a lot of information about him, because 19 years of, as we call it, paper in the business of all of his opinions and everything that he's written.  So actually, this could take a little bit of time to review thoroughly.PERINO:  When they did John Roberts' nomination, they actually went back to memos that he wrote when he was 25 years old in the Reagan White House; ones that he wrote in French they then had to have translated.  That's how meticulous they were.  GUTFELD:  It was a beautiful memo.WILLIAMS:  This guy is well-known, and there is going to be a paper trail.   He was involved with the Oklahoma City bombing, did a very good job there.   And I happened to have come across him when he was investigating...GUTFELD:  You.WILLIAMS:  ... Marion Berry.  GUTFELD:  Oh, yes.  WILLIAMS:  The drugs in D.C. and again...GUTFELD:  How were you involved?  GUILFOYLE:  Were you called as a material witness?WILLIAMS:  Well, because it turns out that if you know Greg Gutfeld suspicion follows.  Ahead, stick around, ""Five"" fans, for a big surprise later in the show.GUILFOYLE:  What is it?WILLIAMS:  Really big.  But first, new feminist outrage over criticism of Hillary Clinton's tone on the campaign trail.  Why they're playing the sexism card.  That's all then, when we return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE:  All right.  Well, something we've talked about here before: Hillary Clinton's fiery voice on the campaign trail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  For all of our challenges, I've never had more faith in our future.  And if we work together, if we go forward in this campaign, if we win in November, I know our future will be brighter tomorrow than yesterday.  Thank you all so very much.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE:  Fired up.  Last night, Twitter was all the buzz, with people in the media commenting on the tone of Hillary's speech.  Glenn Thrush from Politico tweeted, ""Hillary Clinton in a nut shell: calling for love and kindness.  By shouting.""  Joe Scarborough tweeted, ""Smile.  You just had a big night. #PrimaryDay.""  And Howard Kurtz tweeted, ""Hillary shouting her speech.  She has the floor.   A more conversational tone might be better for connecting with folks at home.""  There's more.  Now ""Cosmopolitan"" magazine is slamming Hillary's critics by playing the sexist card.  Quote, ""That speech did not go over well with some dudes in the media, because she appeared, you know, fired up and wasn't all smiles.  At the end of the day, it's not about these journalists' tweets.  It's about the double standard that women face every single day.""  And we're sick of it!  Go ahead, Dana.PERINO:  I don't think the Clinton campaign is entirely wrong.  And women, when you -- especially because you don't have a deeper register.  And I'm not saying anyone has a high-pitched voice.  But remember when -- I mean, I hate the sound of my own voice.  Remember.  You've seen the thing, ""Dana's Corny Joke of the Day.""  Like, ""Dana's Corny Joke of the Day,"" ha ha.  It's not something that you would probably want to listen to.  GUILFOYLE:  Is that your voice?PERINO:  It is my voice.  GUILFOYLE:  Wow.PERINO:  That's how bad it is, right?GUILFOYLE:  We can rerecord it.PERINO:  Remember Carly Fiorina.  What was the thing about her?  She never smiled.  Why doesn't she look happy?  And everyone was like, ""Come on, just give a little.""How many times have we seen reboots of Hillary's campaign, saying, ""Now we're going to show you the more likable Hillary.  Here it comes.""  I think that if you love Hillary Clinton, that speech was great for you.   If you don't and you're settled that you're never going to vote for her, that speech grated on your nerves; and there's probably about 10 percent in the middle who maybe are persuadable.  GUILFOYLE:  All right.  Boys?GUTFELD:  Every time Hillary opens her mouth, an angel falls from the sky and lands in a wheat thresher.  And it has nothing to do with her gender or being shrill.  It's because when you listen to her, she drips with insincerity.  It has nothing to do with her being a woman.  When somebody is yelling and being dramatic, it's because they feel that their speech is weak.  Contrast that with Trump in which it's about as real as you can get.  He never yells.  He's basically talking to the audience, because he's so comfortable in his own skin.  And I hate that cliche.  But that he just talks, and it's real.  But when somebody is yelling and they're not themselves.  Because if we were in a conversation right now...(RAISES VOICE):  I wouldn't be talking to you like this.  (NORMAL VOICE):  But that's what she's doing.  GUILFOYLE:  You do that when you do ""I Hate These People.""GUTFELD:  That's different.  GUILFOYLE:  Yes, yes.PERINO:  That's angry.  GUTFELD:  Yes.  GUILFOYLE:  Right.GUTFELD:  Anyway, she doesn't speak like a normal person.  GUILFOYLE:  OK.  So it sounds like...GUTFELD:  A liar.  GUILFOYLE:  I don't know about that.  But I mean...  GUTFELD:  Talks like a liar.GUILFOYLE:  Benghazi.  You've got to be a happy warrior is what they're saying, Bolling.  BOLLING:  I guess so and...GUILFOYLE:  Be cheerful while you slay a dragon.  BOLLING:  ... again, it's not because she is a female that we're -- I'm saying what I'm about to say.  It's because that's what she does.  She does it more than anyone else, male or female, where she'll deliver a line, knowing where the applause is about to hit, and she'll step on the accelerator right into it.  ""America, am I right?""  And the whole crowd goes crazy.  And then she keeps doing and doing it.  And it's just -- it gets annoying unless...PERINO:  You love her.BOLLING:  ... it's like you love her and it's like listening to your favorite band.  You know, like, ""OK, I've heard this song.  And I can listen to 'Free Bird' yet again.""GUILFOYLE:  Or you could play it at, like, Gitmo really loud to annoy terrorists.  OK, Juan.WILLIAMS:  Well, I know that women politicians think there is a double standard.  But I think she is doing exactly what Greg described.  I think that she feels like, ""You know what?  I'm not my husband.  I'm not Barack Obama.   I'm not a great speaker, and I'm trying to compensate.  I'm trying to deliver; I'm trying to put power and punch.""  People on the left think one of her problems is she's been too timid, too meek, and that she needs to pump it up; she needs to have some passion, the passion to match someone like a Donald Trump.  And she's trying to deliver on that promise.  She's trying to get her base stoked the way that Donald Trump does.  PERINO:  But if you do it in an inauthentic way -- when Bill O'Reilly was giving advice to Jeb Bush one time during this past year and he -- when he had him on the show.  And he was saying, ""You need to match the anger.   You're not rising to the anger.""  And then, if a candidate doesn't feel it in their heart and they try to do, and it's inauthentic, voters can smell that a mile away.  WILLIAMS:  But it's harder, I think, Dana, for a woman.  I really...PERINO:  I do, too.  I remember when Peggy Noonan wrote that sometimes Hillary Clinton can sound like the woman that -- your neighbor who says, ""Your kids left their bikes in the hallway,"" and it just sounds like something you don't want to listen to.  GUTFELD:  Just point out that it's kind of rich of having ""Cosmo"" accuse anybody of sexism.  I mean, my God, have you read that magazine?  I used to write for them.  GUILFOYLE:  Helpful hints.GUTFELD:  They have the lowest assumption of how women think.  WILLIAMS:  Did you write the sex tips?GUTFELD:  I wrote -- I wrote a column many years ago for ""Cosmo.""WILLIAMS:  You don't want to tell me which type?GUTFELD:  I can't remember, but it was something like that.  GUILFOYLE:  Listen.  I mean, it least she's showing that she's fired up and passionate, having some energy, because she's got to compete on the other side with ""feel the Bern, feel the Bern.""  I mean, who really wants to feel a burn, if you know what I mean?PERINO:  But he's kind of entertaining to listen to, too.  GUTFELD:  No, but he's real.  GUILFOYLE:  On ""Saturday Night Live.""  Yes, but people believe that he's real.  PERINO:  That's true.GUILFOYLE:  People believe Trump's real.  And that's why some people are into both of them.  Like, hmm.All right.  Up next, a special surprise for all of our ""Five"" fans.  You do not want to miss this, for real life.  Stay tuned.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO:  OK, here's your surprise.  Are you ready?  GUILFOYLE:  Surprise.PERINO:  This is really fun, because we like to interact with our fans, and I think that our show does it very, very well on Facebook, Twitter, all the rest.  So I was a D.J.  Remember that?  Country music D.J., overnight.  Minimum wage.  Great job.  And so what -- you know, we play music into and out of our block, and they play it according to our likes.  GUTFELD:  On this show.  PERINO:  On this particular show.  GUTFELD:  Right.PERINO:  Obviously.  We're on this show.  GUTFELD:  You were talking about your old job.  I wanted to clarify.PERINO:  I said on this show.  Thank you for that.  Helpful.But they're thinking, ""Why didn't you just read that?""OK, so here's the idea.  We want you to help us choose our music for Friday's show.  You get to choose and recommend your picks for all of us.   We're going to go around and tell you which ones we like.  We're going to use Twitter hash -- handle @TheFive, and the hashtag is ""#DJthefive.""  See that down there, @TheFive and hashtag #DJthefive.So we're going to start with Kimberly, because she's very excited about this.  GUILFOYLE:  I'm super excited.  PERINO:  Because you like the music.  You dance, and you're having fun.GUILFOYLE:  Yes.  I love music.  And I have to tell you, there isn't really music that I don't like.  So I would love you all to pick at home whatever you think is, like, the best song, fun music for me, keeping in mind my persuasion to dance every once in a while.  But yes.  I love, like...PERINO:  Choose a good beat.GUILFOYLE:  Yes, it's got to have a little bit of ""umpf.""PERINO:  And actually, this is going to happen tomorrow, Thursday.  I'm a little bit ahead of myself.  We had a midnight show, and I think it's already Thursday.  Tomorrow, Thursday's show, this is when we're going to play these.  Juan, you have very eclectic taste in music.  WILLIAMS:  I just -- you know, I discovered.  So I've got XM in my car, and I discovered I really like love songs.  I like love songs.  GUILFOYLE:  What did I tell you?WILLIAMS:  I just love love songs.I like -- and then, Imus -- remember Imus? -- Imus once asked me, he said, ""What are your top five songs?""  Right?So I said, you know, ""I like Paul Simon.  I like Marvin Gaye, Frank Sinatra, Sam Cooke.""  So I think it plays into your stereotype about me as the old guy.  GUILFOYLE:  But you love, like -- like, you're definitely the Lionel Richie on Pandora.  Lionel Richie Radio.WILLIAMS:  I like that.GUILFOYLE:  Yes, yes, that's totally you.  By the way, you're sitting on Imus.  Look what the floor says there.WILLIAMS:  It does say, ""Imus.""GUTFELD:  ""Get off of me.""  PERINO:  Eric Bolling...GUTFELD:  ""Get off of me, Juan.PERINO:  ... you -- you gave us a little hint last night of what kind of music you like.BOLLING:  Since day one on the show, I picked the bump in and bump out music.  Bump in comes into the segment, bump out.  I've always had this rule.  First of all, it takes a really long time to do, because there are a lot of rules you have to play with.  GUILFOYLE:  That's why I have Sean do mine.BOLLING:  But they had one rule.  It's the music can't match the segment.  GUILFOYLE:  I like that, though.BOLLING:  So I don't want the song about -- you know, we're doing a segment about horses, I don't want ""Wild Horses"" to be the song.  So can't match it at all.Classic rock in the way in always.  And then something new: hip-hop, pop music on the way out.GUILFOYLE:  You love Justin Bieber.BOLLING:  It's always -- that's -- I liked that...GUILFOYLE:  Yes, you do.BOLLING:  No, no, I liked that one song over the summer.  GUILFOYLE:  Lying.BOLLING:  No, it's -- whatever.  PERINO:  You have eclectic taste.  BOLLING:  Yes.  I like almost every genre of music.  PERINO:  OK, Gutfeld, you have your taste in music.  GUTFELD:  Well, I...GUILFOYLE:  Shocking.GUTFELD:  I think if you're going to make any suggestions for songs, the word ""butt"" has to be in the title.  All right?  I will accept nothing if it doesn't have ""butt"" in the title.GUILFOYLE:  Just give him butts (ph), and I'm not gonna lie.GUTFELD:  If you can find any Norwegian -- any Norwegian death metal, a cappella -- Norwegian death metal, a cappella -- I will play that tomorrow.   Title, ""Butt Itch (ph).""GUILFOYLE:  Just pick, like, Jamiroquai or something.  You like them, don't you?PERINO:  I like country music.  You know that.  I also like Americana, and I like to find -- I'd love to find a couple of new bands to listen to.  GUTFELD:  What about the Osmonds?  The Osmonds?PERINO:  OK.  That's not new.  Levi Lowrey's son told me about a new band called -- well, it's new to me - - Need to Breathe.  We played it a couple of times here already on one of my segments.  It was great.  So...GUILFOYLE:  OK.PERINO:  You guys like it?GUILFOYLE:  All right, cool.PERINO:  We've got to go.  So don't forget, @TheFive, hashtag ""#DJthefive"" and we'll see what we come up with tomorrow.All right.  ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD:  ""OMT,"" go.  PERINO:  It's you.  BOLLING:  It's you.GUTFELD:  I know.GRAPHIC:  (PROMO FOR KIMBERLY'S APPEARANCE ON 'THE O'REILLY FACTOR')  GUILFOYLE:  Put it up again.  GUTFELD:  Well done.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD:  Greg's St. Patrick's Day Tips.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD:  They told me we had to be in a hurry, and then they screw it up.  All right.  Tomorrow is St. Patrick's Day, and if you're going to do a parade in the middle of town, in the middle of the city, I want you to realize a couple of things.  So while you're drinking in the afternoon, the overwhelming majority of people there are going to work.  So do not treat the streets like your own personal urinal.  That bothers me.No. 2, if you're on public transportation, realize that not everybody else is drinking with you.  That means they might be going to the hospital.   They might have -- might be stressed out.  They might be in a bad mood.  So don't start pouring booze on them.  GUILFOYLE:  Oh, my God.GUTFELD:  And if you call in sick on Friday, you do not deserve to drink.  GUILFOYLE:  OK, whoa.  People don't go to the hospital on public transportation, because then they'd die.  GUTFELD:  Some people do.  Dana.  Subways.PERINO:  Quickly, a parent asked me how could they help explain to their 5th grader the differences between economic systems: socialism, capitalism, communism.  I've got a good article posted on our Facebook page from USHistory.org.  And then, of course, ""Animal Farm"" by George Orwell.And Eric actually has the best explanations.  BOLLING:  Very quickly, capitalism, think of Warren Buffett, the profit motive.  Socialism, think of President Obama, redistributor of your wealth.   And communism, think of Bernie Sanders, the guy who's socialist on steroids.GUILFOYLE:  Yes.  Feel the Bern in your wallet.  BOLLING:  OK, I'm up.  This will drive you crazy.  This is what's wrong with the system.  Listen to Curley Haugland.  He's a delegate, an RNC delegate who's also on the rules committee.  Listen to what he said today.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CURLEY HAUGLAND, RNC DELEGATE (via phone):  The media has created a perception that the voters will decide the nomination.  That's the conflict.  That's the conflict here.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING:  All right.  Let me do that again.  Listen to it very quickly one more time.  Listen to what he just said.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HAUGLAND:  The media has created a perception that the voters will decide the nomination.  And that's the conflict.  That's the conflict here.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING:  No, the conflict isn't that.  The conflict is the voters should be determining the president, not the delegates who think they have all the power.  They're elected by the people.  GUTFELD:  K.G.GUILFOYLE:  Curley was one of the Stooges.  I'm going to be on ""Hannity"" tonight -- very excited about it...GUTFELD:  The show.GUILFOYLE:  Yes, with Tucker Carlson and Geraldo Rivera.  GUTFELD:  Yay.  Juanzo.WILLIAMS:  All right.  So a few days ago, I took a painful trip down memory lane.  I went to see the demolition of the ""Washington Post"" building in Washington, D.C.  The building opened in '72, the Watergate era.  I got there in '76 as an intern.  October of 2013 it was sold to Jeff Bezos at Amazon, but the building wasn't included, so they're demolishing it.  It's hard to see the mothership blown up.GUTFELD:  Got to go, buddy.  ""Special Report"" is up next.  Sorry about that.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Donald Trump declares war. Yes, the real estate mogul and presidential candidate is fighting back and taking on his critics. And tonight, he is dominating many polls. Presidential candidate Donald Trump joins us.Nice to talk to you, Donald.DONALD TRUMP, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hi, Greta.VAN SUSTEREN: OK, Donald, you said that Senator McCain was not a war hero and you also gave out Senator Lindsey Graham's cell phone number yesterday. I agree with you on both those things. I think he is a hero, Senator McCain. And I don't think you should have put out that phone number out on air. But having said that, do you want to do-over on those two things?TRUMP: No, not at all. Sharyl Attkisson, the great reporter, came out and said I was absolutely right. And even you, the way you just said it, was wrong about McCain.What I'm angry with McCain about is he has done such a horrible job with the veterans, taking care of the veterans and working with the veterans. They are very unhappy. They are miserable.I mean, these people, I see them all the time, all over on the campaign trail, and they are devastated by the way the veterans administration is not taking care of them. They are being treated just horribly.And as far as Lindsey Graham, I don't even know him. But he came up to me. He wanted to get involved and wanted me to get him on, excuse me, Fox. And I said, what do I have to do with Fox? He said, well, could you give me a reference? I don't even know him.Then he asked for a campaign contribution. He left his number three or four years ago. And I said here is a guy that used bad language when discussing me and I'm not allowed to say something back? So I told the story to a totally overflow crowd in South Carolina, which was an amazing crowd, actually. It was absolutely amazing. And we all had a lot of fun with it.They don't even like him. They are from South Carolina. He is from South Carolina. They don't even like him, but I told the story. But, you know, why should I allow him to say really negative, like call me a name like a baby. He was like a baby. So we had some fun at his expense and that's fine as far as I'm concerned.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, well, the one person you haven't sort of locked horns with yet is Senator Marco Rubio, but today on ""Fox & Friends,"" he took a slap at you.He said that he did not believe the behavior is dignified or worthy of the office he seeks. He was talking about President Obama. But then he says, then he goes on to say that Mr. Trump is employing, basically, the language you are employing is not worthy of the office you speak.TRUMP: Well, I'm not employing bad language, it is people against me. And as far as Marco is concerned, he is he very, very weak on immigration. I mean, the illegal immigrants coming in.And you know, he took a very weak stand and then his poll numbers dropped down low and now they are still pretty low. But we know where he is coming from. He is very, very weak on immigration, and frankly, I think he is trying to get his poll numbers up.So everyone is shooting at me because I have the highest poll numbers by far and so they are trying to hit me. I never realized it would be like this in politics. I think real estate is a lot easier.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, ""The New York Daily News"" put out your phone number today, but they gave your office phone number, but they didn't give your cell phone.TRUMP: Well, that's all right. The good news is nobody reads ""The New York Daily News."" I'm not even sure they had any response to that. Very few people read it. It's a dying newspaper which is good for the public because it deserves to be put to sleep.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, I've been sent a lot of articles in the past few days, where you and I you are linked together in the same article because in march of 2012, should you become the nominee for the republican party and should you have to face off with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.In March of 2012 you told me, which is what is going all over the news, I think she works really hard and I think she does a good job. I like her. You have changed your view? Should you have to square off with her?TRUMP: No, she works very hard. I have no problems with her.VAN SUSTEREN: She does a good job?TRUMP: Excuse me, she was the worst secretary of state in history. This is a long time ago. And you have to understand, I was a business person. I get along with everybody, democrats, liberals, republicans, conservatives. I help everybody as a businessman. And that's one of the reasons I put in a net worth more than $10 billion with some of the greatest assets in the world because when I need something, they all treat me great because why would I say bad things about her when I may need her and I may need other people?And that's part of the problem with the system, Greta, because the system works that way. You contribute to everybody, when you need them, they are always there. Hillary was always there, anybody would be there. I will tell you when it comes now down where you are competing against her, the system is no good. She is controlled by the lobbyists. She is controlled by the donors of the special interests. And, frankly, I used to be one of them. I mean, I used to be somebody that was in business.Now, for the first time in my life, I'm a politician, and I can say this is the way it is. And I understand the system, and I know why the system is broken.I will give you another example, Jeb Bush. He had a meeting with lobbyists. They raised a lot of money for him. Picture on the front page of a big paper. Picture of Jeb Bush with all these lobbyists. They are not going to do the right thing for the country. They are representing China. They are representing all different kinds of interests. Many of them adverse to the United States. He is controlled by those people.When they go to him and they say, Jeb, you vote this way, he is going to vote that way. Nobody knows the system better than me and I have many lobbyists, also. But now I'm in a different world. Now I'm in the world of politics. I don't want any money. I don't need any money as you possibly have seen. And, frankly, I'm not going to be controlled. All I'm going to do is what's right for the American people and what's right for the United States.VAN SUSTEREN: I also read today that you may be going to the border. And I should add that last night. I spoke to Kate Steinle's mother who was here in Washington talking about her daughter who was shot and killed out in California by illegal immigrant.And it was interesting to me, Donald, that I think that she was originally in favor of sanctuary cities, still is in favor of sanctuary cities, but she was appreciative of you putting the spotlight on this issue. And I wondered, I mean, where does this go with this immigration issue and do you worry about the Hispanic vote come, you know, next first election day?TRUMP: Well, first of all, she is a great woman and that's a great family. I can imagine how incredible Kate was. What a shame, by an animal that came in, five times he came in and shot her. And it's a disgrace that it's allowed to happen. And I brought the subject up. And I'm getting tremendous credit for it right now, Greta. Tremendous credit.So we're going to see what happens. I am going to the border. The border patrols have invited me. We have so many people. They want me there because these are tremendous people that are strong people. They want to do their job. They are not allowed to do their job at the border.And I want people to come in legally. And, as you know, I employ thousands over the years have employed thousands of people and thousands of Mexicans and Hispanics. And, you know, an interesting poll came out in Nevada, I'm way up ahead of everybody else. But something that was even more important to me, I'm way, way up on Hispanics.The Hispanics, I was number one by far. It wasn't even close into the 30's. And I said if I get the nomination, I will win the Hispanic vote. Because I'm going to bring jobs back to America. I'm going to take them back from China. I'm going to take them back from all these other countries that are taking our jobs because our leaders don't know what they are doing. And the Hispanics will vote for Donald Trump."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST:  On the buzz meter this Sunday, Donald Trump defies the media skeptics, essentially clinching the GOP nomination as Ted Cruz and John Kasich drop out and the pundits face a very different Republican reality.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS:  As of tonight, with Ted Cruz getting out of this race, Bill, Donald Trump will be the GOP nominee. Barring something cataclysmic. The numbers are just there.CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC:  How great that it would end on a tabloid cover that Donald Trump is going to win the nomination of the Republican Party.ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN:  You also sent a pithy note to our producers last night, let me read it, it was only four words, ""I want to die."" Can you expound on that at all this morning?EUGENE ROBINSON, MSNBC:  This is a cataclysm and the Republican Party today is like Rome on the morning after the night when the barbarians came through the gate, right?(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  But what's the impact of many conservative commentators saying they're still in the never, never, never ever Trump camp? With some republicans from Paul Ryan to the Bush family balking at Trump's nomination, should the press be portraying this as a political earthquake?Plus, as Hillary Clinton ratchets up her criticism of Trump, he hits her with this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Have you ever read what Hillary Clinton did to the women that Bill Clinton had affairs with? And they're going after me with women? Give me a break, folks.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  But hasn't Trump been saying in interviews that he wouldn't go there unless he was provoked? Our all-star lineup includes CBS's Lesley Stahl and Fox's Trish Regan.I'm Howard Kurtz and this is ""MediaBuzz.""It was over in a flash, one minute the press was obsessing on whether Donald Trump could somehow win 1,237 delegates. But then, after a smashing victory in Indiana, Ted Cruz abruptly dropped out of the race and the journalists and the pundits who had scoffed at Trump's chances now had to acknowledge he had done what they had once called nearly impossible.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JONATHAN CHAIT, NEW YORK MAGAZINE EDITOR:  I didn't think -- not only did I not think he would win, I didn't think he was really running for president. I thought he was trying to drum up some kind of publicity for himself.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  I remember sitting in this very building on the day that Donald Trump announced and I said, well, you know, it's a fringe situation and, you know, there are these people -- and it's not going to happen.And that core group of about a third of the Republican Party proved to be enough, it was enough so that Donald Trump could prevail in the end. He could outlast the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Trump became the de facto nominee when John Kasich dropped out the next day, but some conservatives still denouncing him such as syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor George Will, and Trump, not surprisingly, was quick to hit back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: What do you say about George Will, he wrote a column this morning that it's a conservative's duty to make sure you lose all 50 states. What would you say to George Will?TRUMP:  Well, George is a major loser, you know, that as to our guy nobody watches him, very few people listen to him, it's over for him. And I never want his support.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Joining us to analyze the coverage as some top republicans buck at Trump's nomination, Heidi Przybyla, senior political correspondent for USA Today, Gayle Trotter, a commentator who writes for the Daily Caller and the Hill, and Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democratic Network.Heidi, as these journalists and pundits who said Trump's nomination wouldn't happen now they're telling us he faces incredibly long odds in the fall. Don't the media face a credibility gap?HEIDI PRZYZBYLA, USA TODAY SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  In short, yes. If you remember, Howie, when he started out we were all comparing him to Herman Cain, Huffington Post said they were only going to cover him in the entertainment section of the newspaper.So, I think, you know, it wasn't just at the beginning, either, it was all throughout this process. The writing was on the wall after he swept all of those southern states. So, there is a couple things that went wrong here.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  You're saying the denial continues?PRZYZBYLA:  It's not just the media denial but it's the polling was like all over the place. Because I think fundamentally we have shifted away from as well the more shoe leather reporting that I think is so valuable and could have been so valuable in this election and it just didn't get done.And secondly, the obsession with these score boards and counting up the points and calculating everything.KURTZ:  The scenarios.PRZYZBYLA:  Yes, and the scenarios.KURTZ:  This happened and that happened.(CROSSTALK)PRZYZBYLA:  Instead of getting out, and I hope we will learn from that, I really do. And that from here on out as we go forward we will do that shoe leather reporting and we'll actually compare their plans versus just the tit for tat.KURTZ:  OK. I'll kind to that point. But, Gayle Trotter, what's unprecedented here is so many prominent conservative come to this, George Will, Rich Lowery, Bill Crystal, John Goldberg, and Steve Hayes that we'll talk to a bit later still staunchly opposing the republican nominee. How much does that matter?GAYLE TROTTER, DAILY CALLER CONTRIBUTOR:  It helps Donald Trump because it confirms his narrative. His rejection, his disavowal, you know, we had this discussion about him disavowing David Duke and it wasn't strong enough, but now he's disavowing these republicans who are part of the conservative establishment and that merely helps his narrative.And that's where I think Cruz had a stumbling block because he took on Jeb Bush's endorsement, Donald Trump is doing just the opposite. He's saying Jeb Bush refuses to support me despite the pledge. I don't need him.KURTZ:  I'm glad you mentioned the pledge because nobody in the media is hardly mentioning the fact that Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham did sign that pledge which of course didn't mean anything.TROTTER:  Right.KURTZ:  So, I mean, the most very liberal commentators are really now ratcheting up against Trump, that's a little less surprising than people on the right going after him. Do they underestimate him? You talked about this during the primaries at your side might be underestimating the Donald.SIMON ROSENBERG, NEW DEMOCRATIC NETWORK FOUNDER & PRESIDENT:  Yes. Well, listen. We, on this show we discussed this in the first few weeks that Trump was -- you know, got into the race that even the republicans were underestimating him.And so, look, both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump were heavily underestimated by the media in this cycle. Sanders came very close to winning the democratic nomination, got very little press coverage, was never taken very serious on our side.So, yes. I think people -- I think it's been hard to cover this election. I think as you pointed out, people haven't been reporting from the ground. The country is changing, there's something in the air this cycle that the national media has been very slow to catch up to.KURTZ:  You mentioned issues, Heidi. And so, the question of the taxing or raising taxes on the rich and possibly being open to a minimum wage increase, Trump's position is evolving. And the Washington Post did a good job of pointing that out.And Chuck Todd and George Stephanopoulos this morning pressed Trump on this. But how is the press overall grappling with a Republican Party is now headed by a guy who is a nominee unlike we've ever seen in modern political history.PRZYZBYLA:  Yes. I actually think that they're doing a great job using words like major division, split, meltdown, words like that just because this is -- this is not merely a family dinner table dispute, this is potentially a bitter divorce where you have the grassroots heart of the Republican Party splitting away.And now potentially in the position of being themselves the third party candidate versus Donald Trump who has got kind of the soul of what may be the new grassroots of a new party.KURTZ:  These are the right words, Heidi - excuse, Gayle, Politico calling it a meltdown, incredible division, revolt, Washington Post crisis, possible civil war.Trump's campaign I can tell you views this as a healing process not a civil war, is confident that Paul Ryan will come around, they're meeting in Washington this week. Do you think some of the words and phrases and headlines that the mainstream media are using kind of overdramatize the situation.TROTTER:  Now one of the phrases that I liked was that Trump orchestrated a takeover of the GOP and I thought that's reflective, but it shows Cruz's support, too, because he was part of that process with the -- with the effort to oppose ObamaCare even to the point of the shutdown.KURTZ:  Running against what he called the Washington cartel.TROTTER:  The Washington cartel.KURTZ:  Yes.TROTTER:  So, it shows that that message resonated with the grassroots, with American voters. So, I think that people like hearing those very strong discussions of this divorce or family dispute because it shows that the American voters were very unhappy with the leadership in Congress. And so I don't think...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  You don't have any quarrel with these...TROTER:  No, I don't think it's overblown.KURTZ:  ... fiery adjectives.TROTTER:  No.KURTZ:  All right. Now, Simon, Trump ran against the GOP establishment, the process was rigged and so forth, he also ran against the media establishment by the way.ROSENBERG:  Yes.KURTZ:  And so, the GOP establishment doesn't love him. Should that come as a shock to political reporters?ROSENBERG:  No. But I do think the words you used, healing, is going to be fascinating to watch her, right?KURTZ:  That's the Trump view.ROSENBERG:  Yes, and how -- and how, you know, how this is all going to happen. It's going to test Donald Trump's capacity, right, as a politician to bring people along, not been his strong suit, right?And so, I think this process of what happens to the Republican Party, it is a big story. We've never seen anything like this in our lifetimes. So, I think this is going to be with us for some time now.PRZYZBYLA:  The republican analysis so far has been this is happening, Donald Trump is happening because we failed to get our agenda done. The bigger question that I think they really have to do some introspection on, is it because they couldn't get their agenda done or it's because the American voters didn't agree with that agenda as well.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  And I think that...PRZYZBYLA:  And I think that's the point they have not yet reconciled.KURTZ:  Do you think that question is being properly pursued by the press or are we more into the sort of the personalities, oh, Paul Ryan dissed him and Trump is danger to me...(CROSSTALK)PRZYZBYLA:  I don't think we're there yet, Howie.KURTZ:  Yes.PRZYZBYLA:  Because I think you're going to see the down ballot, for lack of another word, affect as well on lawmakers in Congress, how are they going to decide to run their election campaigns and what issues.KURTZ:  Right. But do you think...(CROSSTALK)PRZYZBYLA:  They are going to have to just sober...KURTZ:  ... do you think the press is asking the right question or is covering this more as a school yard brawl?PRZYZBYLA:  I think that they could do a much better job of drilling down on those specific divides and holding some of these lawmakers to account for the votes that they've taken that we've seen in polling for years now was against what a lot of the public believed was right.KURTZ:  All right. So, Donald Trump having essentially clinched this nomination obviously turning his attention to Hillary Clinton and he used some pretty incendiary rhetoric, particularly at a rally on Friday, this is in Eugene, Oregon.Let's take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  She was a total enabler; she would go after these women and destroy their lives. She was an unbelievably nasty, mean, enabler and what she did to a lot of those women is disgraceful.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Now, if Trump wants to call Hillary an enabler, fine, maybe she knew, maybe she didn't know, but I don't know of any evidence that she personally went after any of her husband's paramours and Trump is just saying and this is true.PRZYZBYLA:  Yes, Howie, this is one of those accusations that's been out there for decades. And, no, I haven't seen any evidence of it and Ken Star spent many millions of dollars investigating a lot of these things.And so I think, however, this shows that Donald Trump went there this early in the cycle, that this is going to be something that we've got to get to the bottom of. OK? Let's find out what the facts are, let's put them out there.KURTZ:  Right. I mean, how much people will care about the sex scandals of the '90s is another question. And everything is fair game in a campaign, Simon, but will the media hold Trump accountable for saying he wasn't going to do it now he's doing it?Now he can say, look, Hillary is out there saying he doesn't think much of equal pay for women because he doesn't think much of women.ROSENBERG:  Listen, I think Trump had it both ways, right? He has attacked the media more aggressively than any candidate in the modern era and gotten on TV and gotten coverage by the media more than any candidate in the modern era, right?He is doing a phenomenal job at playing this. And so, I think that one of the challenges the media is going to have this cycle is he's going to put a lot of stuff on the table that is outside the bounds of normal discourse, right? He's already done it. It's going to continue.I think the media is really going to struggle for how to cover stories like that, right and accusations like that.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Let me get Gayle in on this.ROSENBERG:  Yes.TROTTER:  One journalist tweeted on Tuesday night that champagne corks were popping in newsrooms all over America. And I think this gets to the point both of you are making...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Because?TROTTER:  ... because of statements like that that Donald Trump makes that they don't have to big into the policy minutia, they can just report on that, they can report on these extreme things that he says time and time again.He doesn't need to do that, though, he has a strong policy that has resonated with the American people and yet, he continues to make these comments.KURTZ:  I know Hillary told a friend privately this came out years later that she thought Monica Lewinsky was a narcissistic Looney tune. but it wasn't a charge he made on public.Now people around her may have gone after the women and they bloom for this. And very quickly, a quick answer, Trump's Taco tweet, he puts up this tweet showing himself showing himself eating a Taco bowl, that's Taco bowl that made at Trump's tower for Cinco de Mayo. A big story? Media has certainly flagged this one.PRZYZBYLA:  They had to. I mean, it's funny. Come on, after his whole campaign has been built around anti-immigration rhetoric and then, you know...(CROSSTALK)TROTTER:  Anti-illegal immigration rhetoric.PRZYZBYLA:  Anti-illegal, whatever. But it was funny.KURTZ:  It was amusing.ROSENBERG:  It was amusing because, you know, there is no such thing as a Taco bowl.KURTZ:  Right.ROSENBERG:  And it showed how much he actually really didn't understand that Hispanics...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Don't muddy the waters with your enabling -- your enabling details. All right.ROSENBERG:  I know.KURTZ:  Let me get a break. When we come back, some journalists say TV news is to blame for Trump's nomination by rolling over on the guy. Trish Regan weighs in on that.And later, the Obama aid who brags about turning the press into a White House echo chamber.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  The cover of Politico magazine shows Donald Trump facing a media mob with the headline, what have we done? As if the whole thing is our fault. Really?Joining me now from New York is Trish Regan, who hosts the Intel Report at 2 Eastern on the Fox Business Network. Hey, Trish.TRISH REGAN, THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT SHOW HOST:  Hey, Howie.KURTZ:  So, this is an argument being pushed among others by a former NBC and CNN anchor Campbell Brown is no fan of Trump saying, ""TV news is to blame for Trump's nomination and basically just rolled over for the guy."" Your thoughts?REGAN:  No. Look, I don't think that anyone rolled over for the guy. I would actually make the point that a lot of members of the media have been extraordinarily critical of him. He's actually gotten it from both sides.That said, yes, the media has covered him a lot. A lot because he's been making news. I mean, there are some organizations, for example, the Huffington Post, that early came out and said ""we're not going to cover Trump because that's just entertainment, we don't consider it politics, we're putting it in the entertainment section of our web site.""And they clearly learned within a few weeks that that strategy was a failed one. The reality is, Howie, we cover the news every day, Donald Trump, like it or not, is making news.KURTZ:  And of course doing many, many interviews on many, many channels, talks to newspapers.REGAN:  Yes.KURTZ:  So, Jeb Bush, for instance, was the media's appointed front-runner at the beginning. How many TV interviews did he do?REGAN:  You know, that's a great example because I was calling him to get him on my program and he finally came on, but it was extraordinarily challenging.Donald Trump, on the other hand, as you know, Howie, is much more accessible to the media. And so, when you look and compare and contrast to the number of interviews that some of these other candidates did, the challenge is getting them on the air with what Trump was doing it was a very different strategy.I mean, again, I think the frustration was in part as a member of the media, you would see some of these candidates buy this air time, so they would have a 30-second commercial in the middle of your show...KURTZ:  Right.REGAN:  ... but, you know, God forbid, they actually come on and answer some questions.KURTZ:  Exactly.REGAN:  They didn't like that sort of balance of power that they lost, they preferred their bought air time. Trump would go on and answer a lot of questions for the media, sometimes it got him in some hot water but he seemed to be of the mindset that, you know, any news is good news...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Right, right.REGAN:  ... as far as he was concerned in terms of getting his name and brand out.KURTZ:  Now the critics -- the critics do have a point, many, many Trump rallies were covered live, particularly on some other cable news networks and the shows that let him call in when other people didn't have that privilege, and that did give him an advantage and a lot was driven by ratings.But I'm glad you mentioned the negative aspect of the coverage, because, you know, he was getting it from mainstream pundits, they didn't think that much of a chance. He was getting it from a harsh journalism and conservatives and liberals. And then being attacked as racist, sexist, as xenophobic, misogynist, but it didn't seem to hurt him all of those media attacks. Why is that?REGAN:  Yes. That's -- it's amazing that phenomenon. I think in part because many Americans hate the media, they see the media as part of the problem.KURTZ:  Bingo.REGAN:  As part of the establishment, right?KURTZ:  Bing, bing, bing.REGAN:  And here was Trump getting attacked by both the establishment and the media and they said to themselves, OK, he is my guy. He's not getting along with any of these people that I don't like, so, therefore, I think it helped him.KURTZ:  He had -- he had the right enemies, meaning us. Last question, there is this argument that news organizations could have been more aggressive in digging into his business background, his proposals, his misstatements, his contradictions.There was a lot of that, we could always do a better job.REGAN:  Sure.KURTZ:  And again, it seemed to roll off him, or do you think that we could have done a much better job in investigating Trump?REGAN:  I think stuff rolls off him. I think that people are responding to what they perceive as a real authenticity. I think they are seeing this on both sides. I mean, Bernie Sanders, the success he has had thus far, that is simply a product of people responding to authenticity. They like who he is.That's the same thing Donald Trump has going for him. So, it's almost as though whatever happens he's like Teflon, it just rolls off.KURTZ:  Right.REGAN:  People aren't willing to hear it because they're saying to themselves, I like the guy. And you know what? Politics is a lot about how much you like a candidate.KURTZ:  That is true.REGAN:  That's in part what makes a good candidate.KURTZ:  I got to go. But Teflon, most politicians which they had that. Trish Regan, great to see you this morning.REGAN:  Good to see you, Howie.KURTZ:  Ahead, why are so many conservative pundits still in the never Trump camp? We will ask Steve Hayes who is high on that list.But first, Hollywood director Rob Reiner goes off on the press over Donald Trump and makes an incendiary charge.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  Once on the left who spent this campaign denouncing Trump are now struggling to explain he manage to win the republican nomination. Take Rob Reiner, the great director and a big time Hollywood liberal activist and Hillary Clinton supporter.On MSNBC's morning show he got into a heated debate with Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski accusing them and the media in general of not asking Trump about important issues, of not posing tough questions, and of not forcing him to give more detailed answers. The host pushed back hard, but then Reiner pivoted to a different target.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROB REINER, DIRECTOR & PRODUCER:  If you do your due diligence and you continue to do that he will lose because there's nobody in America that would agree with the idea that all Muslims should be banned from the country.SCARBOROUGH:  How do you explain the millions and millions of people who do not watch this show who actually like what they hear from Donald Trump and aren't taking messages and orders from us in the media.MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC:  Right.SCARBOROUGH:  But they listened to what he says for themselves and vote for them. How do you explain that?REINER:  There are a lot of people who are racist.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Wow. Really? Is that the best you can do? Reiner conceded that some Trump voters aren't racist when challenged by Joe and Mika, but Trump is the guy who won 10 million votes in the primaries, who's won 60 percent of the vote in New York and other states to dismiss his supporters as bigots, like Archie Bunker on Reiner's old sitcom is insulting.And shows no real epithet to understand his appeal to angry and frustrated Americans.Now, Washington Post columnist, Dana Milbank has also ripped Trump as a liar and misogynist and other things and was so dismissive of his candidacy that he made a vow that is coming back to bite him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DANA MILBANK, WASHINGTON POST:  Seven months ago, I said I would eat an entire column, news print and ink, if Trump won the nomination. Calculating that Republican voters were better than Trump. The Republican voters let me down.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  I guess Milbank will indeed have to eat crow. Along with the side helping of media attention.Up next, CNN asks Hillary Clinton if she'll start doing more interviews and she starts complaining about Trump's interviews.Plus, Ted Cruz rips Fox News and other networks for being in Trump camp, but is that true?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  Things got really nasty in the final days between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz with the senator calling him a serial philanderer, and the billionaire citing a National Inquirer story linking Cruz's father to Lee Harvey Oswald.Cruz also ratcheted up his ratcheted up his rhetoric against the media.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  There is a broader dynamic at work which is network executives that made a decision to get behind Donald Trump. Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes at Fox News have turned Fox News into the Donald Trump network, 24/7.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Heidi Przyzbyla, Cruz had been making this charge about TV news in general and then he brought in Fox just before the Indiana primary. What do you make of what he said?PRZYZBYLA:  I happen to remember, Howie, that Ted Cruz's very first fundraising e-mail went against the liberal media and that was a tactic for him from beginning to end so I kind of see this as a book end.KURTZ:  Right.PRZYZBYLA:  To the substance of it, I mean, it's a little crazy considering you just have to read Megyn Kelly's twitter feed to know that this is not the pro-Trump network. There are some Trump friendly anchors on this network, there is no doubt about it, but at the end of the day this is not, you know, Trump -- a Trump news network.KURTZ:  There are also a lot of Trump -- a lot of trump critics on this network.PRZYZBYLA:  That's right.KURTZ:  And now Megyn Kelly and Donald Trump have made peace.(CROSSTALK)PRZYZBYLA:  It's biggest.KURTZ:  All right. So, the coverage of Cruz in the final 10 days, I would say, Gayle, was very rough, he was called desperate, even in news stories, and so real flounder stuff, but he was losing. So, do you think it was fair or unfair the way he was portrayed at the end?TROTTER:  Oh, unfair. Unfair. It's like the Michael Dukakis line in that famous Saturday Night Live skit where he said I'm losing to this guy?KURTZ: Yes.TROTTER:  And I think that when you saw Cruz erupt with these kind of fabulous things that he said it was out of a sense of frustration of, you know, he embodies the conservative movement, the protection of the Constitution.And yet, even media that is seen as being friendly towards preserving the Constitution. And, you know, standing against some of the illegal actions that Obama has taken, for Cruz to be portrayed that way in all of these media outlets was very frustrating to him.PRZYZBYLA:  But it was Donald Trump who called him unhinged and the media just reported on that. I don't know that it was a media pronouncing Ted Cruz...(CROSSTALK)TROTTER:  OK. Let me give you an example. Let me give you an example. When Cruz pulled out you take The New York Times stories, The New York Times story about Cruz withdrawing was very, very negative. It said he spoke in apocalyptic terms and it just had negative word after negative word.Same with the description of Kasich, The New York Times which had endorse him talked about Kasich's moderate views and his soothing message. So, you saw this over and over again because they thought Ted Cruz should be one of them.He had gone to Princeton, he went to Harvard, he was in one of aghast deliberative bodies in the entire world, so it was upsetting to the mainstream media that he was not one of them.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Well, I will...PRZYZBYLA:  There's no doubt that, you know, there's many people in the media who maybe didn't like Ted Cruz but Ted Cruz's biggest problem was with the other republicans and the media is just reporting on what those republicans are saying.(CROSSTALK)TROTTER:  No.KURTZ:  Let me jump in, I will just -- I will just add this. Ted Cruz was losing, he's on the verge of getting out the race and the media do have a bias in losing candidates they kick them around because they know they're not that long.ROSENBERG:  Yes.KURTZ:  All right. So, let me just come back briefly, Simon, to this question of this National Enquirer story which had a photo which supposedly showed the senator's father, Rafael Cruz with Lee Harvey Oswald that bring up the JFK assassination.So, Trump says, you know, hey, I was just citing in published report, Rafael Cruz called this ludicrous, Ted Cruz said he was nuts. Did the media hold Trump accountable for that.ROSENBERG:  Did they?KURTZ:  Yes. Did they?ROSENBERG:  No. I mean, I think -- I mean, I think that, you know, there is an entertainment factor to Trump and he has acknowledged this publicly, right? I mean, this is part of his appeal. For most Americans politics is boring and he's interesting, right?And so, I think everyone is a little bit caught up, including the media, in trying to make this business really a little more interesting to people. But look, he has made it clear that he's going to open the boundaries up of what's normal in political discourse, he's really going to challenge the media this cycle about where they draw the lines on exactly this kind of stuff.KURTZ:  All right. Let me turn to Hillary Clinton because she's given a few television interviews now and she looks forwards the fall campaign. Even though Bernie Sanders I think hasn't given up and still hanging around. Here she is with CNN's Anderson Cooper, and the question was about Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDERSON COOPER, CNN:  He does run a different kind of campaign than anyone else certainly on the GOP side, he makes himself more available to reporters, he calls in. I mean, is that something you are going to start doing more of?HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Oh, well, look, he did it and it worked for him and I think reporters now have a chance to ask some tougher questions. The man is the presumptive nominee and, you know, being a loose cannon doesn't in any way protect him, I hope, from being asked the hard questions that he should have been asked during the whole primary process.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Did Hillary Clinton duck the question about whether she's going to do more interviews?PRZYZBYLA:  Totally.KURTZ:  Yes.PRZYZBYLA:  Look, I think the one good thing that can come out of this in terms of the media's relationship with our elected leaders is that since the Bush White House things have gotten worse and worse in terms of access for the official media who are with the candidates day in and day out. And hopefully, Trump's accessibility will start to change some of that because it's only gotten worse from what I understand from my colleagues who cover the Obama administration.KURTZ:  OK. Briefly, what was your reaction to the way Hillary handled that question?TROTTER:  It was a dodge and she's famous for dodging. But you look at the number of times Donald Trump has been on the Sunday shows or the cable news shows during the week and he's about six times what she's doing.Now that they're going one-on-one she's got to up her game, she's got to step into the arena.KURTZ:  Or she may just have a different strategy, Simon Rosenberg, and not want to be on the news quite so constantly. Her interviews don't tend to make as much news as his do. You could argue that either right.ROSENBERG:  Yes. She's -- look, she's done a lot of interviews. I mean, and she's not getting the people who are covering her day to day are not getting as much access. But, you know, Anderson Cooper making -- there is a whole list...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  People covering her day to day...ROSENBERG:  Yes.KURTZ:  ... are hardly getting any access.ROSENBERG:  Right. But I mean, she's still out in the media doing interviews.KURTZ:  Yes.ROSENBERG:  And to your point, she doesn't make as much news, there's not as much follow on as there is with Trump.KURTZ:  Right.ROSENBERG:  I mean, every time Trump speaks there's a million tweets and there is another network.KURTZ:  Right.ROSENBERG:  And she is more even killed on this stuff. And so, I think the campaign is going to have to make a big decision, right, about whether they feel this is a problem or an asset and I think it will be interesting to watch.KURTZ:  All right. On that point, Simon Rosenberg, Gayle Trotter, and Heidi Przybyla, great to see you guys this Sunday.I had Lesley Stahl on whether the media are applying the same standards to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.But first, many conservative commentators are doubling down on their all- out opposition to Trump, doesn't that help Hillary?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  Some conservative commentators aren't exactly falling in line behind Donald Trump. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough may have talked up Trump's chances of winning the primaries, but now the former congressman says this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SCARBOROUGH:  Because I can tell you, I'm not -- I'm never going to vote for a guy that is saying he's going to ban somebody just because of the God the worship.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  That's a reference to Trump wanting a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants. Steven Hayes, a Fox News contributor and senior writer at this Weekly Standard just wrote a piece titled ""No Trump."" We sat down here in studio 1.Steve Hayes, welcome.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD SENIOR WRITER:  Howie, how are you?KURTZ:  As an outspoken Trump critic, are you now in an uncomfortable position that Donald Trump is going to be the nominee of what's always been the conservative party?HAYES:  Well, yes. I mean, I've made arguments against Donald Trump for several months now. And you don't ever like to lose arguments. On the other hand, I think it's important as a journalist that somebody who basically has dedicated my career to try to tell the truth to keep telling those truths whether they're uncomfortable for me or not.KURTZ:  Now Trump has never tried to be the candidate of the Weekly Standard or National Review, and yet, he out and sold his vision to 10 million republican voters in all kinds of states.HAYES:  Right.KURTZ:  Could it be that he is more in touch with what those republican voters want than you are?HAYES:  Well, certainly those republican voters who voted for him. He didn't win a majority of republican voters.KURTZ:  There are 17 people in the field to begin with.HAYES:  Seventeen people in the field to begin with. No question, that's both a blessing and curse for him. I think it's one of the reasons that he won but he doesn't have quite the mandate that he otherwise would have, I think had he won that majority.KURTZ:  Is your opposition more ideological or more about Trump's personal style?HAYES:  You know, that's a good question. I think it's a mixture, for me personally, it's a mixture. I don't believe he's philosophically conservative, he's been basically a progressive for most of his life, he doesn't from one day or not next know what his positions on issues are.I mean, he was, late last week doubting his own tax plan, he's been on both sides of minimum wage, on both sides of ground troops against ISIS, on both sides of single payer, on both sides of the healthcare mandate, on and on and on.And look, I think it's important to have somebody as a conservative who shares conservative principles if he's going to lead the conservative party.KURTZ:  So, on the issues where he say he has evolved you are skeptical of his conversion at least on some of it.HAYES:  Yes. I mean, sometimes his conversions literally don't last a day. I mean, he said during a debate that he was in favor of the ObamaCare mandate and literally said the next day that he's opposed it, I think because somebody got to him.But on the personal side, I mean, I do have personal objections. I'm far from perfect, I don't hold a presidential candidate or politician out to that standard at all. I would be awfully disappointed all the time if I did.But there, you know, Trump whether you're talking about his comments about women, whether you're talking about, you know, making fun of POW's, the would-be commander-in-chief making fun of POWs.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Well, we know the history. But, Steve, how do you grapple with the fact that by continuing to oppose Trump you are making it that much more likely that Hillary Clinton will be the next president?HAYES:  Yes. I just don't buy the binary choice there. I mean, I think first of all...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  OK. With a republican nominee and a democratic nominee.HAYES:  Right.KURTZ:  Unless there is a third party candidate, which your editor Bill Crystal favors.HAYES:  Right.KURTZ:  It is a binary choice.HAYES:  Well, six months out...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Going to be one...HAYES:  ... six months out, I think it's still possible that there could be a third party candidate. You have Ben Sasses, Senator Ben Sasse from Nebraska urging a third party candidate and an independent party -- or an independent candidate to run.KURTZ:  Let's say that doesn't materialize.HAYES:  If it doesn't happen...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Trump versus Hillary, you're still not Trump.HAYES:  But it's not mandatory.KURTZ:  Never Trump. Never ever Trump.HAYES:  There is not mandatory voting in the United States, I'm never Hillary, I'm never Trump, but it's not the case. And it's just logically it doesn't make sense.Newt Gingrich and others have been making this argument that if you're not for Trump you're functionally for Hillary Clinton. Well, if it makes Newt Gingrich and I are still better, I will say I'm not for Hillary. I'm never voting for Hillary, so then functionally for Donald Trump.KURTZ:  So, you're kind of abstaining.HAYES:  No, I will vote. I mean, it's important to say...KURTZ:  Yes.HAYES:  I will vote, I will vote down ballot, I may be right in, I will vote third party, I will vote libertarian. I voted libertarian in 1996 when Bob Dole was too establishment for me. So, I voted for the libertarian.KURTZ:  Brief answer, are you feeling a backlash from Trump fans?HAYES:  I mean, to put it mildly, yes. I mean, you know, if you go on Twitter your mentions are basically unusable, which is too bad. I liked to go to my Twitter mentions because sometimes people would, you know, give you things to check out as a reporter, to follow up or a news tip or whatever.KURTZ:  Now you are avoiding it.HAYES:  No, there's no point. I mean, the abuse we've heard about this, the abuse is over the top and silly.KURTZ:  To be continued. Steve Hayes, thanks very much for joining us.HAYES:  Thanks.KURTZ:  After the break, how much bias is there in the mainstream media's reporting on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and why so little coverage on 60 Minutes? CBS veteran Lesley Stahl is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  How are the mainstream media covering a campaign that's now headed for a Trump/Clinton showdown? I sat down in New York with Lesley Stahl, the veteran ""60 Minutes"" correspondent and author of a new book, ""Becoming Grandma, the Joys and Science of the Grand parenting."" Lesley Stahl, welcome.LESLEY STAHL, ""6O MINUTES"" CORRESPONDENT:  Thank you.KURTZ:  Now that Donald Trump will be the republican nominee there is this indictment that the media are to blame for this, that the TV coverage hasn't been aggressive enough. Do you buy that?STAHL:  It's been aggressive, but he has been incredibly wiley, flipping, sliding away from tough questions and, you know, you can follow up only so many times.KURTZ:  Right. But he does expose himself to questions.STAHL:  He does.KURTZ:  Because he does so many interviews.STAHL:  Exactly. There have been a lot of tough questions and maybe even a good follow-up. But then, you know, you get -- I've been in this position, you get to the point where you're almost badgering someone when they don't answer. And I think the audience does understand when they're not answering a question.KURTZ:  Right. That's always a fine line for an interviewer.STAHL:  Exactly.KURTZ:  Because you don't want to let the politician off the hook but you don't want to seem prosecutorial.STAHL:  That's right, and then you become the story. So, it is...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  And that has happened and Trump makes it happen because if he doesn't like the interview he will go on Twitter and blast...STAHL:  Clearly.KURTZ:  ... whoever he is unhappy with.STAHL:  Here we are at Fox, obviously. No, but I do think that it's been a little bit of an unfair accusation that the press hasn't pursued. What's really astonishing is that the press has and every time he hasn't told the truth he's been called out.But the interesting thing is the public doesn't care and they used to with other politicians, but they don't care with him.KURTZ:  Many people think the media love Hillary Clinton but she's had her own history of testy relations with journalists. Why is that?STAHL:  Who says the media loves Hillary?KURTZ:  There is a lot of people out there who think the liberal press wants Hillary Clinton to win.STAHL:  Yes, I've heard that. But I don't think -- I've never bought that. You know, having covered the White House through a democrat Jimmy Carter and Reagan following, I mean, Reagan got a much softer, easier press than Jimmy Carter did.So, I mean, when people look behind what they are saying and feeling, they will see that the evidence isn't there. I think that the press is much more biased against power, real power than, you know, against one party or the next.KURTZ:  OK. I know Trump was on 60 Minutes last fall but the program hasn't done that much on what has been the wildest campaign in modern history.STAHL:  Well, it's been covered.KURTZ:  Yes.STAHL:  It's not as if we're going to get a fresh bite at it. I think we're going to do some stuff now starting in the fall.KURTZ:  Do you -- do you miss covering politics in a year like this.STAHL:  I do.KURTZ:  Does it eat at you? Do you want to get out there?STAHL:  When I watch the interviews what we were just talking about, I'm shouting at the television, ask him this, ask him that. Get in there. But I do sympathize because as I said you can be -- you can budge on and the public just going to turn against you and make you the object of their -- their viewing and instead of the candidate.KURTZ:  Just to be clear. You don't think there's any tilt in the press to the left or to the democrats or away from the republicans? You think it's the way...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Well, I don't want to go on the record saying that I know everybody how everybody votes.KURTZ:  Just between you and me.STAHL:  Just between you and me. I don't think you see it in the coverage. I think Hillary's getting a pretty tough press, and I think she will continue to get a pretty tough press because she is powerful now.She's pretty much almost certainly the candidate, and the focus and the high beams will be on her more than they have been, and the same with him, Trump.KURTZ:  Before we talk about your being a grandmother. Let's talk about you being a mother. We all balance work and family. And you write in your book about covering the Reagan White House and you asked your daughter Taylor how much of her childhood that she thinks you missed?STAHL:  Yes. She didn't seem to notice that very much. It was eating away at me.KURTZ:  Yes.STAHL:  But I'm an unbelievable list maker and I have compulsive list disorder and I had lists to keep her busy, as busy as she could be so she wouldn't notice I wasn't there.STAHL:  Then you went to 60 Minutes and down with Donohue, the legendary executive produce, he warned you that you'd be on the road most of the time. And you wrote the first year 18 cities, 9 countries and you write what kind of mother was I?STAHL:  I know. I think I had more guilt than I should, and my daughter has told me that many times. She said if you had been home, and this is true, I know this is true, if you had been home more, you would have been on my case. We wouldn't be as friendly as we are. We have a great relationship and I do think my energy needed to be siphon off somehow.KURTZ:  But perhaps it's made you relish grand motherhood more than otherwise?STAHL:  Absolutely. I've gone off the deep end as a grandmother, and I wrote the book because I was so surprised at the depth of my loving, at the intensity of it, and I wanted to find out why.And if I was like all the other grandmothers, and I am, where a society, a sorority of women who have fallen madly in love with their own grandchildren, and grandfathers, too, by the way, same thing.KURTZ:  One more from the book. You were interviewed for a documentary after joining 60 Minutes and you were asked what it's like working alongside these giants.STAHL:  Yes.KURTZ:  Your reaction to that question?STAHL:  Yes. I didn't like that question too much.KURTZ:  Because?STAHL:  Because I thought I earned my place there. I had been the White House correspondent, I anchored Face of the Nation and it had the tinge of sexism to it, so I didn't like it. I didn't show it because the camera was on my face. That's the other thing. If you ever get angry or frustrated.KURTZ:  Yes. It's a viral moment.STAHL:  Exactly.KURTZ:  Yes.STAHL:  With the cameras on and you're sitting there trying to hold it down but it didn't leave my head. Even as I wrote the book, and that was 25 years ago. It's still kind of churning in me.KURTZ:  I got that impression. Lesley Stahl, thanks very much for joining us.STAHL:  Thank you.KURTZ:  That was fun.Still to come, a top CNN executive said it's true the network had a problem with the liberal bias, and the Obama White House aide who openly boasts about manipulating the media.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  CNN has battled the left leading label for years and now network president Jeff Zucker has fessed up, quote, ""I think it was a legitimate criticism of CNN that it was a little too liberal."" He told The Wall Street Journal for a piece on how the campaign is helping its ratings.Hey, I give Zucker a point for candor and he says we've added many more middle of the road conservative voices to now already strong stable of liberal voices. Now that would seem to leave out conservative to warrant, quote ""middle of the road but a step in the right direction.""Every White House spins the press, but Ben Rhodes, President Obama's deputy national security adviser comes off as rather smug in bragging about it. Rhodes tells New York Times magazine in an embarrassingly puffy profile, quote, ""The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old and their only reporting experience consistently being around political campaign. That's a sea changes. They literally know nothing.""Well, Rhodes has a point and saying that newspapers cut backs and closing as far viewers have sidelined many experience journalist, but still end. When he talks about creating, a quote, ""eco chamber of what his aides called 'compadres' in the media who go online and on Twitter and repeat the administration messages they are being spoon fed."" For example, misleading details on the narrative of just when the Iran nuclear negotiations began.It gives ammunition to those who think the media's Obama coverage is too soft. Now, every administration fervently spins the press. There's a reason why my book about the Clinton White House is called ""Spin Cycle"" but few officials have the audacity to boast about it on the record.Well, that's it for this edition of Media Buzz.
