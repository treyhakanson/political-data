This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" November 3, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino. This is The Five. And there are stunning new details about another investigation involving Hillary Clinton just five days before Americans go to the polls. The FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for more than a year. Looking into possible pay for play deals between the former Secretary of State and donors to her family's charity. According to sources of our chief political anchor, Bret Baier, this probe is a very high priority for the bureau, propelled by an avalanche of brand-new evidence. Let's bring in Bret now. He is the anchor of Special Report -- if people haven't had a chance to see your show last night and what sort of follow-up you have had today.BRET BAIER, ""SPECIAL REPORT"" ANCHOR: Hi, Dana. Two sources with intimate knowledge of the investigations, because you have the e-mail investigation as run by the National Security Division of the FBI, and the Clinton Foundation investigation that's run by the white collar crime division, public corruption branch of the FBI. They have been going on, the Clinton Foundation investigation, despite reports that it had stopped, it never stopped. It continued. It has been wide ranging involving four different offices of the FBI. It is being run out of the New York office, actually. They characterized the information coming in as flowing in, because they have new information coming from the WikiLeaks e-mails that are showing some interaction between the Clinton Foundation and the time at the State Department, not only with Secretary Clinton but you have also the e-mails about Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, who both at one time or another at least taking paychecks from both the State Department and the foundation or the company that started the foundation. They don't eliminate the fact that there is a split inside the FBI, not only between the FBI and the DOJ on how this is moving forward and the extent to which they believe it is substantial, but there's also a split within the FBI about this. And it is very out in the open, as you saw in the Wall Street Journal piece that came out today. That doesn't take away from the fact that there are people still going after it every day and believe that they have a lot of information that's flowing in.PERINO: All right. We're going to take it around the table. Let's start with Eric.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Bret, can you shine some light on this discussion within the FBI about some of the agents and some of the higher level agents upset that the DOJ, specifically Attorney General Loretta Lynch, wanting to push back on some of the investigation into the Clinton Foundation and whether that was what spurred Comey to actually come out and say there's more we need to reinvestigate the Clintons?BAIER: Yeah. I think that that's part of it, Eric. And we don't have a lot of the granular detail about the anger. But we do know that there was anger and is anger inside the FBI about how this progressed. Whether that -- we don't have the ability to go into Jim Comey's head. But whether that was part of his calculation with what he did with the letter to Congress, we'll see. Part of the calculation was clearly that Loretta Lynch met with the former president on the Tarmac in Arizona. And that, you know, took her, for the most part, out of that equation, and gave Comey the go ahead to do what he did. I do want to mention about the hacking. There is really a lot of confidence, high confidence that the private server of Hillary Clinton was hacked by some foreign intelligence agencies. One source said up to five of them. You will remember back in July that Comey when he made his announcement said there were possible foreign actors, possibly gained access. He went on to say that foreign hostile actors did go after and get into the personal e-mail accounts of some of the people tied to Secretary Clinton. He then went on to say that Secretary Clinton's server was less secure than the average G-Mail account. These sources point back to that testimony as being probably right on and that he could have said at that time it's probable they got in at that time in July, or even highly likely.PERINO: Juan Williams.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Bret, it strikes me that he didn't say that. But I just wanted to ask about you some of the reporting that we have been hearing from you recently. Because today on the campaign trail, you have Donald Trump citing you as saying that there's likely an indictment coming on the basis of the FBI's work and Donald Trump suggesting, you know, based on innuendo that the FBI is leaking this to become involved with politics and aiming at an indictment of Hillary Clinton. Is that right?BAIER: Well, first of all, on the likely indictment thing, that was an inartful way to answer a question at 7:00, which I was asked about where it was going from here. The real situation is obviously these investigators are building a case. They are gathering evidence. And as investigators do, they feel strongly about the evidence that they have. But they still have to present it to a prosecutor. And then that prosecutor has to go in front of a grand jury and that's the process, if not a DOJ prosecutor, then possibly a special prosecutor that could only be appointed by the attorney general. So the process -- it was inartful the way I said it. The people we talked to said they believe they have a lot of evidence and would continue that effort after the election was my point, to continue to push possibly for an indictment. The fact that Donald Trump uses it on the campaign trail, this has been covered, it is a fact that the foundation investigation has been going on for a year, that it is continuing. And unfortunately, the way I answered that one question at 7:00 o'clock, obviously, made it into a lot of headlines.PERINO: Indeed. All right. Kimberly.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Thank you for not avoiding The Five. We're big fans of yours here. So as a former prosecutor, when you say and I hear from investigators that they have a lot of evidence, that's very sufficient to bring in front of a grand jury to present for an indictment. That's just the facts. It's not like you are putting a case in front of a jury trial, yet with a different standard. To get an indictment, you have to show there's a probable cause, sufficient evidence exists, that a crime has been committed. It's not that high the standards, to be quite honest having tried and having put many cases in front of a grand jury. Nevertheless, it sounds like this investigation is going forward, that it's got legs, as we say. And then, what are the next steps, can you say, besides the fact that perhaps a special prosecutor, obviously, people have some concern about justice or attorney general handing it directly, especially given what has transpired prior to this.BAIER: Yeah, I don't think you are going to see anything between now and Election Day. I don't think that -- I think that this is a slow moving process, that there is anger in some quarters inside about how this has been handled. And perhaps that's why, you know, some of this and other stories have come out. The Wall Street Journal kind of depicted that this morning in their story. I do think -- and remember, also, any target would have the opportunity, if there was a grand jury, to testify.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: In their defense.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BAIER: Yeah. And for evidence in the defense. I think that there may be efforts to get people to cooperate, if you get to that point. When we say a lot of evidence, we don't have a characterization of what exactly that is. But we can see the WikiLeaks e-mails coming out every day and we can see what has been reported already about the various elements of the interaction between different companies and the foundation. We should point out that the campaign is clear, that they don't think that there is any violation here, that they tout the success of the foundation for doing good things around the world. The foundation itself put out a statement today saying that they're not aware of an investigation. But we can tell you that one is continuing.PERINO: All right. Gutfeld.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hey, Bret. So there's like -- going back to the fact that there are two things going on, it seems to me that one side, the Clinton Foundation stuff, it sounds like a quarrel between like the top brass and the guys on the street, like an episode of Baretta. And it's like another institution that seems to be rattled by 2016. Like every organization, institution, political or otherwise, seems to be having some kind of conflict that is born out of this election because no one is happy with the choices. So they're turning on themselves. They're devouring each other because they're so dissatisfied. That's one part. The other part is the story that I think is the big one is what you mentioned, the hacking is huge. I mean, it sounds like 99 percent certain. How can we get to 100 percent on that? I mean, I want to know. This is a big deal. That's a problem.BAIER: Yeah. If you ask any -- well, first of all, on your first question, these guys are about the FBI. They're not about the politics, honestly. I pressed a number of different sources, a number of different ways. As far as I can tell, they're not fans of anybody. They're talking about investigating. As far as where we're talking about this hacking, they have thought that for a long time. If you talk to experts in the field, they would say, that was wide open for you know a foreign intelligence agency to go in. The Clinton campaign can tell you it never happened. But there's a WikiLeaks this week that the I.T. guy, Bryan Pagliano e-mails that in two days they had 10 serious attacks that he notified the U.S. Secret Service about. Now, back then, in July, Comey testified and announced that foreign actors had gotten access to people that Hillary Clinton e-mailed with. Well, it doesn't say -- there was a New York Times story in July that said it doesn't take a lot to connect one to the other and the digital bread crumbs are easy to get to the server. So there's a high confidence. And as far as how many foreign intelligence agencies, one source said five, who knows, but it's more than one.BOLLING: Can I just jump in? I know we have to go, but very quickly. So our audience understands, but there are two lanes to the FBI investigations going on simultaneously, right. So whether or not she e-mailed classified material and was hacked is one lane, and the other lane being whether there was corruption between the Clinton Foundation and various other actors. Either one or both could end up in indictment of Hillary Clinton?BAIER: That's true. They're both continuing. Obviously, they're going through the Anthony Wiener laptop and all of that digging into. We have confirmed that they have the two other laptops of Cheryl Mills, the former chief of staff and Heather Samuelson, a top aide. We thought they might have been destroyed. They weren't. They're in the FBI office here in Washington, D.C. And you also have the e-mails that they're -- that they have already gone through and the e-mails that they're just learning about. So, yeah, you have two tracks, the foundation and the e-mail investigation.PERINO: All right. Thank you, Bret. He will have more tonight on Special Report at 6:00 p.m. You can tune in then.Next, even more developments on the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton. And then later at Fastest Seven plus rare campaign address from Melania Trump. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: With five days left, is the proverbial poop hitting the fan?You just heard Bret Baier on the latest news; will it make a difference? What if the emails found on Weiner's laptop did come from Hill's server? And what if there were new discoveries that had classified info?One of Baier's sources claims that Hill's server had been hacked with info stolen by ""at least five foreign intel agencies."" If true, how will Hillary beat this rap? With this rap by her pal Lena?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LENA DUNHAM: Progressive freedom fighter going up against a dude who is a climate change denier. She works harder than her man did. Still saw her grandkid. People have the nerve to ask her what the plan is. The plan is to win again. Break it down in three words. I'm with her.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: She must be working for Trump. Seriously, that's so bad it could turn Chelsea into a NeverHillary. And sorry, Lena, the gender card has been so played out, it's falling on deaf, pierced ears.Look, if you already hate Hillary, this new stuff won't change things. And if you already hate Trump, this won't make you love him. Battle lines are drawn, nothing sticks. But it seems like the truth is now the bull in Hillary's china shop. Remember, Nixon was pretty cocky too, up until he wasn't.Events are now dictating the news, not the other way around. So even the edgiest celeb and a sympathetic media can't help.Now, you'd expect Hillary to explain things. But perhaps, she's just speechless. And maybe, like everyone else she knows, she'll simply take the Fifth. Or drink one.Should she be freaking out or she is just saying, five days to go, hang back, no one cares?GUILFOYLE: No, it's time to freak out, I think. I mean, like Lena Dunham's song, that's not going to help her. And when you say the news hasn't made much movement. I disagree. More movement than chipotle in your stomach.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Why do you always have to bring up that?GUILFOYLE: Well, it just tickles your gastrointestinal.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: She's got them right now, too, I think. Because the problem is when you see in the Fox decision desk moving different states on the map, you see the movement, things that were leaning them, going back to Republican. You have to be concerned. Because the momentum, late breaking here, is with him, so not with her. That's a problem.GUTFELD: Nicely done.GUILFOYLE: Thank you.GUTFELD: Dana, research that says people have already made up their minds. But what about the undecided? There has to be undecideds that are going.PERINO: Yeah.GUTFELD: This is nuts.PERINO: And Stirewalt describes that there are still some slack in the line. I'm not sure what that means. But he says that a lot.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: There are pills for that.PERINO: But there are more undecideds than before. Over this past weekend, one of the things that's definitely in Donald Trump's favor is that a lot of Republicans who might have been on the fence decided to come home. I know you are going to band that phrase.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: So if you're with Donald Trump, then you're thinking OK, we got the momentum. We have got news cycle is on his side. And then as you saw yesterday, he gives -- he says into the microphone, which I thought was kind of funny and cute, he says, OK, just stay on message. He can do that for the next five days.GUTFELD: Yes. Listen to somebody other than himself. Eric, should she respond?BOLLING: They are in panic mode.GUTFELD: Yeah. But should she respond?BOLLING: She has no way to respond.GUILFOYLE: What can she do?BOLLING: Here is how she has responded. Go ahead, release them. Let us know, James Comey. And then, she takes shots at Comey. Well, you know, I'm not sure you want that. All the stuff we're finding out and we talked about the piece in the Wall Street Journal yesterday. Call her bluff. Yeah, call her bluff. Let us, let the media, let the world sift through 650,000 e-mails. We will get it done like that. We will let you know by Friday or Monday. We'll let you know what's in those e-mails. They are in panic. Bill Clinton last night or today on the trail called all of -- worse than deplorable, all of Donald Trump supporters stupid. He said Trump keeps these people angry. He started referencing race and geographic locations. He was just off the charts, horrible and said Trump likes to keep them angry because if they're not angry, they will ask questions and they will become smart. He doesn't want them smart. Calling every Trump supporter stupid. They are in panic mode. They're scratching. You can see this. When people are pressing or when they are in the zone, Trump is kind of in the zone right now, the Clinton campaign is pressing.GUTFELD: Juan, what do you think? Are they in panic mode?WILLIAMS: Not close. But I'm entertained by the idea that Trump supporters very much want the idea of panic and they very much want the idea that something is pending. You know, a lot of this, I think, is sort of people who are hungry for Trump to have some advantage. But if you look at all the models, everything suggests, there hasn't been any big shift.BOLLING: Oh, there's a huge shift.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: It was tightening before the Comey announcement.BOLLING: How you can say there is no shift, Juan?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Can I just finish for just a moment?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: In other words, things were tightening before because as Dana put it, Republicans were coming home. You could see consolidation of Republicans. And now, we're at the point where at least this morning when you look at the tracking polls, New York Times, all of these, what you see is a two to three point, I think real clear politics has two to three.BOLLING: Incorrect.WILLIAMS: What you get is a situation where at the moment, and I find this incredible. There's all this sort of equalization. Oh, so Donald Trump and his foundation, forget about it. You know, Donald Trump and his insults to women, forget it. Donald Trump and his racism, forget about it. So we don't talk about that. Hillary Clinton and it's possible the FBI suffering such a tremendous backlash. And by the way, I think that's to Hillary's advantage. It has become involved and politicized to the point where people are questioning the Justice Department and the FBI. To me, this is a tragedy. This is a tragedy for America.BOLLING: The tracking polls today, Juan, you want to talk about tracking polls? IBD has it a tie, ABC has Clinton plus 2, LA Times has Trump plus 5, Real Clear Politics averages and is down 1.7 in from about a 6-point Clinton lead about a week and a half ago. This is a -- with a week? It's a seismic shift.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: No, no, it's not. I keep telling you that what is happening is Republicans -- I keep quoting Dana -- come home to Trump, OK. But you don't ever see, I think you look at all the polls. Look at them. There's none that shows Trump suddenly expressing a great lead or that Clinton's wall of states, the states that have given.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: They had her up by 12 a week ago.WILLIAMS: . has somehow diminished. It's just not there.BOLLING: Oh, oh, oh. There are a lot of people moving some solid blue into leaning red. There are.WILLIAMS: It's not real.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: New Hampshire for one. At Fox.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: When you give them this.BOLLING: Where is New Hampshire? Let's not -- it's not false. Where is New Hampshire, blue or red?WILLIAMS: Right now, I think it's close. That's what you are saying? But it still leans towards Clinton.GUTFELD: All right. Enough. One of the most infamous curses in sports history was finally broken last night, a world series, Fastest Seven ahead.And later, Melania Trump gave a campaign speech today in the swing state of Pennsylvania. See that coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back. Time for the fastest six and a half minutes on television, three turning stories, seven minutes, one tenacious host. First up, I rode my bicycle to Wrigley Field 1,000 times as a kid, stood outside the ballpark on Waveland Avenue, left field, waiting for an Ernie Banks home run ball. Anybody, just make it a Cub home run. We threw the opponent's home run balls over the left field wall. Finally, 108-year World Series drought is over.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here is the 0-1. This is going to be a tough play. The Cubs winning the World Series! It's over! And the Cubs have finally won it all, 8-7 in 10.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, KG, you know what gives me the chills besides that? Obviously, we have never seen it in my lifetime, 108 years, that was the drought. You know, how many stitches are in a baseball -- in a major league baseball?PERINO: One hundred and eight?BOLLING: One hundred and eight stitches.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: This is helping the baseball superstition.BOLLING: Are you kidding me?GUILFOYLE: No, I thought it was a fantastic series. I really enjoyed it. I think it was what America really needed. To watch this and you see the joy and the celebration. And boy, what a great game seven, you could see the stress, the fans watching it. Some people were biting their nails and going crazy. I stayed up all night with my rally cap on watching it.BOLLING: Very good.GUILFOYLE: It was fantastic and great double plays, too.BOLLING: Juan, so Nate Silver at 5:38, put a headline out a couple of weeks ago, saying the Cubs have less of a chance of winning than Donald Trump.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: When they were down 3-1?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Well, that's probably true statistically. I don't think many teams come back from 3-1. So it was a miracle. And I'm all for it. You know what I like so much about it? I thought this game was over early and it was like -- I think it was 6-3.BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Then the Indians come back. I was like, oh, my gosh. What is going on? The stadium is going crazy. You had all the celebrities in the stands. And then, it goes into rain delay. How long is this game going to last?GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: So just a tremendous, tremendous baseball game. Just wonderful.BOLLING: Did you hear about -- there was someone on Twitter in 2014 predicted a Cubs-Indians World Series that would go seven into extra innings, but also predicted the world was going to end.PERINO: When?GUILFOYLE: November 8.PERINO: OK. For some Cubs fans it could end tomorrow, and it would be happy. It's fun to see everybody having that much joy. I liked watching Bill Murray.BOLLING: Yes, he's been great. Greg, don't tell anyone, but I fell asleep before the final out.GUTFELD: That's OK. It was long. It was long.But you know, I'm happy for the Cubs. But it's still discriminating against people who, quote, ""don't make the cut."" I think we need to start examining baseball privilege. We saw 25 people in the game to win this thing. But there are billions of people, just because they're not athletic or they have the right skill set, are not allowed to play professional sports.GUILFOYLE: They're a university somewhere for them.GUTFELD: We have to crush the baseball ceiling, the professional baseball ceiling. Everybody, every child, every adult, every animal should be allowed to play professional sports.BOLLING: If you can throw 104 mile an hour fastball...GUTFELD: I can't. But that should not matter.BOLLING: ... you'll be able to play.GUTFELD: It should not matter. No standards.BOLLING: Let's do this one. The World Series was a massively watched event, and for good reason. Two Midwest cities, a combined 178-year absence from the winner's circle. A massive 40 million-plus viewers for the finale. The candidates seized -- presidential candidates seized on the opportunity to be seen in front of a pro-American crowd and a huge one at that. They took out political ads. Now, first, Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The American moment is here. Two choices. Two Americas, decided by you. Hillary Clinton will keep us on the road to stagnation. Fewer jobs, rising crime, America diminished at home and abroad.Donald Trump will bring the change we're waiting for, America, better, stronger, more prosperous for everyone. A plan for tomorrow. A future brighter than our past. The choice is yours.DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm Donald Trump, and I approved this message.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: OK. Who likes this one? Anyone like this? You want to take it?GUILFOYLE: I love the...GUTFELD: Wait. Aren't we going to show Clinton's?BOLLING: You going to do Clinton's now?GUTFELD: Yes, I think that would be fair.BOLLING: That was going to be topic three. OK, here's Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing.When I come home and dinner is not ready, I go through the roof.I'd look her right in that fat ugly face of hers.She ate like a pig.A person who's flat-chested is very hard to be a ten.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you treat women with respect?TRUMP: I can't say that either.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right, good.GRAPHIC: Anyone who believes, anyone who says, anyone who does what he does is unfit to be president.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: OK, Greg, there's both of them.GUTFELD: It's a perfect example, though, of how different real life is from politics. Like, everybody goes and watches the game. It's unifying unless you -- you know, you don't like the other team. But if you're a Clinton -- pro-Clinton or pro-Trump, you could sit there and unify under the Cubs. And then you have -- campaign ads are the diametrically opposite of what life should be.BOLLING: Yes. So much happiness, so much exhilaration going on, and then you go to these and you're like...PERINO: Dark music. I would say for both campaigns, very well done ads.BOLLING: Yes.PERINO: To communicate their closing message pretty well.BOLLING: Juanito.WILLIAMS: You know what struck me was the ad -- the children's ad that Clinton ran. I was really taken by it. Which was, you know, the children are watching, and then they had some of the Trump statements.And to me, you know, you look at these ads, I thought the Trump ad, for example, was kind of more. I didn't think it was glum. I just thought it was upbeat, kind of pro-America stuff.But the other one is the one that sticks with me. And so I just wonder, you know, who made these ads. But at the moment, in terms of the ad spending, you see a lot of ads coming this weekend. So get ready. I don't care what you're watching, especially if you're in a swing state. You're going to get sick of ads.BOLLING: All right, K.G.GUILFOYLE: I think...BOLLING: Don't they say things come in threes?GUILFOYLE: Yes. We'll see what happens.BOLLING: (UNINTELLIGIBLE), Cubs.GUILFOYLE: Trump. Yes, you meant to say that the last one. I know. I said, Bolling, you missed that.You know, I think that for Trump, his best ad is the one that he didn't have to pay for, and no PAC paid for, which is this investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail, to the server, to the breach of national security. That really is the headline for unfit. You know, you don't have to do much advertising beyond that in terms of this investigation is still going with news breaking on it every day. It's crippling.GUTFELD: I thought you were going to say all the free air time on certain cable shows.BOLLING: All right. All right. They're telling me to tease. Next, who leaked the CNN debate question? Did DNC Chair Donna Brazile? Jeff Zucker is going to get to the bottom of that. And that's coming up in a minute.And later, Melania Trump delivering a rare address to the American people on the trail today. We'll play some of that for you ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: CNN covered a huge embarrassment and was forced to sever its ties with DNC chair Donna Brazile after it was revealed that she was feeding debate questions to Hillary Clinton.Now president Jeff Zucker expressed outrage. But he still isn't disclosing the results of an internal investigation into where those questions came from. There's all kinds of bias on full display over at the Clinton News Network this week alone. Here's one of CNN's legal analysts expressing suspicion about the timing of the FBI's release of its files on President Clinton's pardoning of Marc Rich.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: The official statement from me is give me a break. The -- you know, I have made FOIA requests. And they take years. It's a very different process.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Fifteen years?TOOBIN: It can sometimes take 15 years. And -- and the idea that they were obliged to do this on top of Comey's statement about Hillary Clinton last week, it just shows, at least that they are oblivious and incompetent, if not actively partisan in this -- in this presidential race.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: And although The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department intervened to stop the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation, one of CNN's reporters dismissed the notion that politics was at play as a conspiracy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)EVAN PEREZ, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Behind the scenes, there's been several investigations that were ongoing in four different offices -- Los Angeles, Little Rock, Washington and New York -- into allegations of impropriety in the Clinton Foundation.And behind the scenes, because some agents thought that things weren't moving fast enough, they -- they started believing conspiracies that perhaps politics were at play.And it turns out a lot of what they had, Carol, was based on this book called ""Clinton Cash."" It was published by Peter Schweitzer, and he's now an editor at Breitbart. But a lot of -- a lot of the allegations in there have not been substantiated.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: So, Dana, you worked at Justice. What do you think of these comments by Evan?PERINO: I think I would be very -- I would be very reticent to ever criticize FBI agents and their integrity. So I don't think that's a good strategy for Hillary Clinton's team. And I think that there could be a possible I.G. investigation into all of this, because it has been unusual. And I think there might be a call for one.I do want to point out one thing. On the file that was released about Marc Rich, we were e-mailing about this the other morning. I think I figured out why that happened.Is that Eric Holder, that morning, had put out an op-ed in The Washington Post criticizing Comey, on the same day that attorney general -- former Attorney General Mukasey had done the same. So it's not he was -- that was a partisan thing. But Eric Holder was the pardon attorney at the Justice Department when the Marc Rich pardon got approved.And I think the FBI people are like, ""Oh, really? We'll just make sure that everybody is reminded of that."" That's what I think happened there.WILLIAMS: Boy, I hope you're wrong. Because I mean, again, you know, what you just heard from Jeffrey Toobin, you know, is the suggestion the FBI now is settling grudges, Dana?PERINO: I don't know.WILLIAMS: I just think more of the FBI and Jim Comey than this. I'm just so disappointed that suddenly they find themselves now, you know, viewed as an arm of the GOP or the Trump campaign. How sad is that for the great FBI? You see stories in the paper now comparing Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Again, getting into the gutter politics of trying to harm a campaign. They had no business in this. And you've seen this from left and right.GUILFOYLE: Really? You're seeing...WILLIAMS: Not just liberal media but conservative media. Our own Judge Napolitano now, they're saying this is wrong. And that's why I say, you know, people say, this is -- this is -- who's going to believe...GUILFOYLE: Obviously the Clintons...WILLIAMS: People are saying, gosh, this is the FBI? If they're doing this, something really is wrong. Somebody is trying to skew an American election. And it is corruption on the part of the FBI?GUILFOYLE: What about the part of CNN and the role that they're playing and the commentary that they have? I mean, this is, you know, not a good news day for them or for a news cycle in terms of their involvement and being complicit. They had to let one of their people go that was greatly admired. Someone a lot of people like.WILLIAMS: That's a different story. But I agree with you. That's not good for them. And this is the Donna Brazile story we're talking about, Kimberly.What is interesting to me there is networks, including our own, paying people, you know, who have a relationship to one campaign or another, which as a journalist, I thought, boy, that's odd. I remember Brit Hume saying to me he thinks it's odd. But now we -- now it's common place. And in the Donna Brazile case, Jeff Zucker says, ""Oh, we know exactly what happened."" But he doesn't tell us what happened.GUILFOYLE: All right. Let me get Bolling in.BOLLING: They fired her, and they did, and they should have fired her. And I call for her to be fired -- or actually, call for her to step down from the DNC as well as being fired two weeks ago. And she should still do that.Juan, how can you say that James Comey is playing politics when he under oath, with his hand raised at the hearing -- the prior hearing where he recommended -- where he was going over what they found, Hillary was reckless, et cetera, et cetera. At the hearing he was asked, ""OK, Mr. Comey, would you, if you do find more evidence, will you reexamine the case?"" Under oath, he said yes. They found more evidence. He's just doing what he promised he was going to do.GUILFOYLE: And what he was prevented to do by everybody getting immunity deals and deleting e-mails.WILLIAMS: Eric, we've gone over this before. He has not been able to review any evidence, because that would be illegal.BOLLING: That is absolutely incorrect, Juan. If evidence of a murder falls in your lap, you can't ignore it. You cannot ignore it.WILLIAMS: It's so wrong. I don't even know where you get that from.GUILFOYLE: Greg, clean it up.GUTFELD: I like eggs.GUILFOYLE: Come on!GUTFELD: No, I mean, regarding the way we -- when we're talking about CNN, I will quote the Bible. And I never quote the Bible. He that is without sin among us, cast the first stone.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: We'll be right back.GUILFOYLE: Throw to Greg.Melania Trump took center stage on the trail today, delivering her first major campaign speech of the general election. The highlights when ""The Five"" returns. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: In the five days -- in five days, there's going to be an election. And we've got you covered right here. All-day coverage on the FOX News Channel, America's election headquarters. Don't miss it. ""The Five"" will be here Saturday.Today on the trail, Melania Trump made a rare appearance. She gave her first major speech since the RNC.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MELANIA TRUMP, WIFE OF DONALD TRUMP: We are deeply grateful to the millions of Americans who believe in my husband, because they know he believes in you.As Donald travels the country, he has asked some simple but very important questions. Do we want a country where every American gets a fair shot? Yes. Do we want a country that honors our Constitution?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!M. TRUMP: Do we want a country that honors life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!M. TRUMP: Do we want a president who is a fighter for us and will never give up?Then we want Donald Trump to be our president.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Dana, so this is the first time she's been out since the problems at the Republican National Convention. She went to Philadelphia's suburbs, Berwyn, apparently to appeal to women voters. What do you think?PERINO: Smart strategy, because that's where they've been down, with college-educated women voters in those suburbs. So I think that's really smart.She also talked about the importance of something that she cares about, which is cyber bullying, which is online bullying, like social media bullying. And I could not agree more. I think we should do more about it.WILLIAMS: So Eric, she talked about coming from Slovenia and her personal path. Were you -- were you moved? Did you like it?BOLLING: Yes. And I especially liked Mike Pence's wife introducing her. I thought it was a great -- a great strategy. And as Dana points out, the suburbs of Philadelphia is where he needs the most help. It was very nice. I liked to see it.WILLIAMS: And Kimberly, what did you think about, you know, the way she came across? She's -- we haven't seen her in so long. Why did they keep in hiding until now?GUILFOYLE: I don't think that they kept her in hiding.PERINO: In hiding.GUILFOYLE: I don't think so at all. I mean, she's an independent. She's her own woman. She speaks her own mind. She's not like, you know, a delicate flower. I mean, she looks like a beautiful flower, but she's not a delicate flower. Meaning she's out there. She's supporting her husband. I thought she did a very good job.And I'm glad she had an opportunity to do a speech that was widely covered. I think it's tough, you know, as a woman and as a first lady. And then what happened, you know, at the convention. And then coming back here, I thought she did a fantastic job. And I'm sure the people there enjoyed it, as well, and those who watched at home.WILLIAMS: Greg, what about if we had Bill Clinton and Mrs. Trump, what do you think? What do you think?GUTFELD: Well, I don't want to know what he's thinking.She actually -- out of everybody involved in this 2016 campaign, she deserves the most sympathy. Because she was probably the last person who ever expected to sign up for this.PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: When she married -- she was like, this will be great. Go to parties and have kids. She didn't -- I don't think she ever saw this coming. And the fact that -- I always go to this. Imagine if you were thrown into that situation in another country. If I were in Russia...WILLIAMS: Oh, God.GUTFELD: ... as a first man or whatever, I would be hiding under -- I would be hiding under a bed.GUILFOYLE: You've got to give her more credit than that. She's an asset to her husband.GUTFELD: No, I just gave her credit. What do you want, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: I want you to be respectful.GUTFELD; What did I say?BOLLING: She may be enjoying it, too.GUTFELD: No, no, no, no, no. I think -- I think it's been tough. I think it's been tough for her.BOLLING: The fun of being first lady, I mean, that's got to be enticing, to be in the White House.GUTFELD: They want me to endorse her. OK. I endorse her.WILLIAMS: All right. Greg...GUILFOYLE: Now you may go back to your room.WILLIAMS: Greg is off the fence.""One More Thing"" up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: All right. No, it's not about a dog. This is ""One More Thing."" I don't have a dog. I have my other favorite thing, country music, because last night was like my World Series and Super Bowl all in one, the Country Music Awards, and the co-hosts were Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley. They opened the show with a monologue that was really funny. And they sang a Randy Travis song about the election. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARRIE UNDERWOOD & BRAD PAISLEY, COUNTRY MUSIC SINGERS (singing): The election is taking forever and ever, forever and ever, forever and ever. Make it end.(MUSIC: ""DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS"")(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: OK. That was Dierks Bentley. He was singing with somebody you like, Elle King.GUTFELD: OK.PERINO: And that was the musical event of the year in 2016, ""Different for Girls.""GUILFOYLE: Look at Greg's face. Greg, you were kind of singing along, actually. I want to note that for the record.PERINO: Making fun of me.Kimberly, you're next.GUILFOYLE: OK. And in ""Kimberly's Gaming News"" -- no nexio needed or supported. All right. So this is about gambling, because since we were just in Vegas. Imagine if this happened. Because if this happened to me, I would lose it.So what happened is this poor lady, she's an unemployed mother of four who actually grew up in foster care. Thought she hit the big $43 million jackpot on the slot machine. It would have changed her life forever. She went to go play it. It said, ""You're the winner, $43 million.""They're like, ""Oh, sorry, malfunction,"" escorted her from the casino...PERINO: No way.GUILFOYLE: ... and offered her a steak dinner instead. Apparently, because they have a disclaimer on there that says malfunction, the machine voids tickets. And the maximum payout on that machine would be a total of $6,500, not 43 million.But she has a lawyer. So let's see what happens with the poor thing. She's really bummed out.They could have at least given her a free room for a week or something.BOLLING: Yes, they better make that right. They better fix that.GUILFOYLE: They're in hiding. We're going to get back to you on that.PERINO: All right. Gutfeld.GUILFOYLE: We'll have it for you.GUTFELD: Time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Secrets to Happiness.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, results.GUTFELD: All right. Do you know when you go in to get some food? Always try to arrive early. And do not try to cut in line like this young little whipper-snapper did, if you see over here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(PIGS NURSING, WITH PIGLET SHOWING UP LATE AND PUSHED OUT)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: That's what happens. If you showed up early -- watch that one more time. This is what happens when you don't show up early. Yes.PERINO: Bet he doesn't do that again.GUTFELD: No. Because he died.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.Now we're going to get e-mails. Can you say something? He's alive.GUTFELD: I was joking. I was joking.BOLLING: We've got to save some time for Juan here at the end. OK, very quickly, last night had a wonderful time with the Women's National Republican Club in New York on 51st Street. A couple of pictures, very quickly.GUTFELD: No wonder you missed the game.BOLLING: Adrienne with the president, Robin Weaver.Here where he again, very quickly. Next picture. Quick. These are a bunch of people from there. Also, Ronnie Pearl (ph) is the booker there, fantastic. Great bunch of conservative women. I'm telling you, they are very concerned about a Hillary Clinton presidency. They don't want any part of that. Any part of that.PERINO: They have a beautiful building over there, too.BOLLING: They sure do.PERINO: Juan.WILLIAMS: So the big news, everybody knows it's been a long time since the Cubs won the World Series, 108 years, as Mr. Bolling told you. And of course, things were very different back then. For one, Wrigley Field didn't exist; opened 1914. Also, women couldn't vote. Nineteenth Amendment not passed until 1920. Three, no black baseball players, not until Jackie Robinson came on the scene in 1947. And finally, finally, there was no sliced bread, Greg. No bread. My gosh.GUTFELD: You notice it's write.WILLIAMS: This is like ""Back to the Future."" Remember, ""Back to the Future"" predicted that the Cubs would win the World Series last year, but they got it right this year.PERINO: All right. That was a great one, Juan.Set your DVR so you never miss an episode of ""The Five."" That's it for us. And ""Special Report"" is next.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
