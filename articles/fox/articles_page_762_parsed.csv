2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/05/13/bill-oreilly-changing-america/	Bill O'Reilly: A changing America	"Interesting poll from the Associated Press about immigration. When asked do you favor or oppose providing a legal way for illegal immigrants already in the U.S.A. to stay in the country legally: 50 percent favor, 48 percent oppose. When asked do you favor or oppose providing a way for immigrants who live in the U.S.A illegally but whose children are U.S. citizens or permanent residents to say legally: 57 percent favor; 40 percent oppose. The poll was taken among American by adults.Another finding: three-quarters of Republicans say they would prefer a candidate who would undo President Obama's executive actions on immigration. So there is a big split between Democrats and Republicans. But the majority, according to the A.P. poll, would consider policies that are beneficial to illegal aliens. That's a change.On the religious front: another poll very provocative. According to a Pew Research study of 35,000 American adults Christianity is on the decline. 2007: 78.4 percent of Americans describe themselves as Christian. Last year 2014 that number drops to it 70.6 percent. Among the non- Christian faiths, Jewish Americans up slightly; Muslims up half a percentage point to just under one percent of the population.However the biggest growing segment of religion, those who reject it - - atheists, agnostic, nothing, up 50 percent to 22.8 percent of the population now. So what's happening?There is no question that people of faith are being marginalized by a secular media and pernicious entertainment. The rap industry for example often glorifies depraved behavior and that sinks into the minds of some young people, the group that is most likely to reject religion. Also many movies and TV shows promote non traditional values.Truth is if you are a person of faith the media generally thinks you are a loon. The prevailing wisdom especially among young Americans is whatever is good for me is good, period. The overall good be damned -- pardon the pun.We see that reflected in the attitude on drugs. There is a strong move to legalize them and decriminalize even the sale of poisons like heroin and cocaine. Any student of history knows that when a nation turns inward toward the pursuit of individual gratification, the country is in trouble. Rome -- the best example. The citizens there ultimately rejected sacrificing for their republican -- for their republic, I should say -- and the empire collapsed.""Talking Points"" believes the same thing is happening in America today. But it can be fixed if the electorate finally wakes up. That is a big if. The main reason Christianity is on the decline is poor leadership and corruption within the Catholic Church. The priest scandal devastated the Catholic landscape in America.Although the founding fathers wanted freedom of religion, they did not want a secular nation. That's clear in the writings of Jefferson and Madison. The founders believing that a strong moral code put forth by religion protects people from harm and avarice.On the immigration front chaos is simply overwhelming. Americans remain essentially a fair people. They know the system is broken. And they know our leaders are playing politics with people's lives. There is a fair way to deal with illegal immigration and Americans want that put into place.Adding it all up, there is no question the country is changing for the worse. And that's why the upcoming election is, perhaps, the most important presidential vote in our lifetime.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On the Buzz Meter this Sunday, the campaign gloves come off. Donald Trump and his rivals are throwing punches and the media can't get enough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDERSON COOPER: Tonight with breaking news in words like these, ""Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that?""MARTHA MACCULLUM, FOX NEWS: Now the critics are pouncing on the Donald for this off-the-cuff slam against Carly.MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS: He was quoted by the Rolling Stone reporter saying Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that?CARLY FIORINA, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not going to spend a single cycle wondering what Donald Trump means.BEN CARSON, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I haven't heard it. I haven't seen it.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't know Ben Carson. He was a doctor, perhaps an ok doctor by the way.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: But is the press spending too much time on personal attacks? We'll ask Ben Carson, the surgeon turned presidential candidate who surged to second place about that and the way he's being covered, and Laura Ingraham on why many conservative commentators are calling a Trump a counterfeit Republican.After months of avoiding the press and dismissing the email mess, Hillary Clinton finally apologizes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I should have used two accounts, one for personal, one for work related emails. That was a mistake. I'm sorry about that. I take responsibility.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: But as her aides promised a warmer and funnier Hillary, did she go far enough in her ABC sit down?Plus, Stephen Colbert makes his CBS debut with Joe Biden, highly emotional Joe Biden, and lots of political humor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN COLBERT, 'THE LATE SHOW' HOST: I promise you just like the rest of the media, I will be covering all of the presidential candidates who are Donald Trump. That's right. Donald Trump is swearing off Oreos. He claims that Mexico is taking our economy and they're ripping it in two. And they're scraping out the creamy center.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Will the new ""Late Show"" host be a political force without the fake anchor stick? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is ""MediaBuzz.""It keeps on happening. Donald Trump delivers an attack. The pundits say he's gone too far and until now at least he goes up in the polls. This time the target was Carly Fiorina as Trump saw her face on a TV screen and said this in front of a Rolling Stone reporter.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: He was quoted by the Rolling Stone reporter as saying ""Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that the face of our next President. I mean, she's a woman and I'm not supposed to say bad things but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?"" Your reaction?FIORINA: Honestly, Megyn, I'm not going to spend a single cycle wondering what Donald Trump means but maybe, just maybe, I'm getting under his skin a little bit because I am climbing in the polls.CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: First it was Rosie than it was Megyn, and now you got Carly Fiorina. They got you in Rolling Stone Magazine making fun of the way she looks. Why do you talk about how women look so much? You know it's not presidential.TRUMP: I'm talking about persona.CUOMO: You said look at that face. You said look at that face.TRUMP: The fact is that Carly Fiorina has had a terrible past. She was fired viciously from Hewlett Packard.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Sharyl Attkisson, a former CBS correspondent who is launching a Sunday show called ""Full Measure"" on Sinclair Television Station; Steve Hayes, senior writer at the Weekly Standard a Fox News contributor, and Dana Milbank, columnist for the Washington Post. Sharyl, are the media justified in making such a huge story about Trump's comments about Carly Fiorina's face?SHARYL ATTKISSON, 'FULL MEASURE' HOST: Well, people are interested for sure. But I would point out that when Trump is insulted quite horribly, nobody feels sorry for him and it's not the top of the whole segment asking how he feels about it. I think Carly Fiorina probably reacted the right way and did the right thing. But Trump supporters in bigger sense don't care. They think that his intention for insulting people is outweighed by the skill set they believe he has to do the important things.KURTZ: So it's not the usual why won't he apologize drum beat that the media often play?ATTKISSON: Well, they know that if they do drumbeat, he's just not going to play that game.KURTZ: Are the media buying Trump's explanation, Steve that he was talking about her persona and not her looks?STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, no. I would say the general problem is because it's preposterous. Of course he wasn't talking about her persona. He was talking about her looks very clearly, if you read the excerpt from the Rolling Stone article. I think you saw Chris Cuomo push him a little bit on that. So you really said this was about her face. He's not being asked to apologize in the way that I think other candidates would. And it's not disqualifying in the way that it might be for other candidates for the exactly the reason that Sharyl suggests. He's done this so many times before crossing lines that I think most people think shouldn't be crossed and it helps him.KURTZ: Trump may not have planned this attack on Carly Fiorina but he did make these comments in front of a reporter. But again, you have the chorus of pundits saying this time he's gone too far, and yet this media criticism basically seems to help him.DANA MILBANK, THE WASHINGTON POST: I do think something is changing now though. And I think you're seeing it in -- the beginning you see in the media coverage which is reflective of how the other candidates are treating Donald Trump right now. You see Jindal, you see Carson, you see Fiorina finally saying unacceptable. And it is unacceptable. It has nothing to do with ideology or politics. You can't talk about women that way.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Trump says he's doing some of this as an entertainer.MILBANK: Well, he's doing it as an entertainer and we're greatly entertained in the media, and he has been very good for our business, although I don't think we should all be giving our money to him for raising our ad rates.KURTZ: We'll come back to that. All right, Sharyl, so Ben Carson at a Q&A in California criticizing or questioning I should say Donald Trump's faith, and Trump -- we saw a little bit of come back well, he was an ok doctor and the guys world-class neurosurgeon, for the media, big story, medium story, not a story?ATTKISSON: I think again anything that Trump says about them or things that they say about him, seems to be an interesting story to the public and to the media. But I still say for that core group of Trump supporters, they don't care. Even if they don't like the insults that are secondary to the big things that they're desperate to get done that they feel for whatever reason only Trump can do.HAYES: Well, the core group of Trump supporters frankly often doesn't care about very basic things like facts and reason and logic, but Ben Carson...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Wait. Are you saying that Trump being at 32 percent in the latest poll is a function of -- chunk of the country that's so enamored of him that they don't really care about the substance?HAYES: Yes, sometimes I think that's true. I think for large number of Trump supporters they just don't care. And it's not that they are so enamored of Donald Trump as they are angry about the establishment, Republican establishment, Washington establishment, media establishment here. And they don't care about anything else. Their argument is look at what the establishment has delivered. Our politics is a mess. The Republican Party is meek and cowardly and Donald Trump is challenging them. And even when he breaks these traditional conventions, he does it well.MILBANK: Here's what Donald Trump gets right. He may be a bigot, he may be a misogynist but he gets the media culture that we thrive on, conflict above everything, above party, above ideology, and he is one big ball of conflict, insulting everybody, getting into fights with everybody all the time. So of course we cover the Carson/Trump fight or Fiorina/Trump fight. It's like a heavyweight fight. We are drawn to that sort of a back and forth.KURTZ: These are ultimately food fights but they also -- I think there must be some voters out there who say what does this have to do whether I can keep my job, whether my wife is working two part-time jobs and all of that? It's not that candidates don't talk about that but it doesn't get anywhere near the oxygen that we're talking about.ATTKISSON: Hearing this fight goes on, I'm telling you there's a core group of people that watches that and thinks the media is treating him unfairly playing the substitution game. I know people on this panel probably don't agree. But when Trump is -- it's said about him that he didn't read the bible because he's not in it, that's a pretty big insult but nobody went to Jindal and said are you going to apologize for that, because they feel Trump deserves it is. But you know they don't necessarily feel the other candidates deserve it when they get hit by insults.KURTZ: And Steve, you're right when you talk about anger and not just the Washington political culture but media culture, which is one of the reasons I think -- when you or others criticize him, people say its media elite. What have they done for us lately? Let me play a soundbite -- talk about Trump picking fights. He sent a letter this week to CNN President Jeff Zucker. Of course, CNN hosting the second presidential debate this coming Wednesday. It kind of echoed what Trump had said in similar comments. Let's take a look at that now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I should go to CNN. They're doing the next debate. And I should say to Jeff Zucker, a great guy, Jeff, I'm going to do the debate but I want $10 million for charity, American cancer society, aids research, we'll pick ten great. Otherwise I'm not going to the debate. And honestly, I think they would pay me.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: No comment from CNN, which is being asked to cough up all of the profits because Trump says the ad rates have gone up 4,000 percent or something like that because of his participation.ATTKISSON: Well, intentionally or not, one could say it's a reminder to the public that the media, which most of us like to think of us neutral observer is not always really that. They profit from the theater and they profit from the political campaign.MILBANK: I love the whole notion here that he should be paid for generating headlines and readership so we should pay terrorists if there's a terrorist attack or the airline when they send an airplane down into the ocean. It would be an excellent precedent.KURTZ: In fairness, he's not saying -- he's saying give me money but it would go to veteran groups of his choosing. Fox News asked him at the D.C. rally here the other day, where he spoke against the Iran deal -- against the Iran deal, well -- will you really not show up if CNN doesn't pay the money? And he said I have yet to make that determination. He said in a letter I refuse to brag but I'm responsible.(CROSSTALK)HAYES: This is actually -- I mean -- look, I think it was a gimmick. He's gotten more press about it. We're talking about it.KURTZ: Driving another news cycle.HAYES: But it's an interesting question for him because on one hand, Donald Trump is an ego maniac who thrives on nothing but attention, and skipping the debate would deprive him of some of that attention. He wouldn't be on a stage for all that. But of course, it would gain him more attention because that's all everybody would be talking about, the debate that night if he didn't show up people would be saying the front runner for the Republicans has decided not to come. So he wins either way. He just gets more attention.KURTZ: When you call him an ego maniac, I detect dismissive -- he's not a serious candidate and eventually he will flame out. Is that fair?HAYES: Yeah, he's not a serious candidate. I'm not saying he'll flame out. Look, I'm one predicting about Donald Trump. I thought he was going to flame out earlier. But let me say this. Let me say this. He's not proven himself a serious candidate. Even if you look at the substance of the answers he provides on the issues he knows the best, the economy, and jobs go and look at the answers he's provided. He says nothing of substance, nothing.MILBANK: I disagree slightly with Steve. I think that he is being taken more seriously now because his opponents are taking him seriously. It's not that this is a little clown on the side and we're going to ignore him because he'll go away. I think he's starting to get that scrutiny.KURTZ: He's starting to be more restrained both in his speeches and interviews because he sees that he has a shot to win this nomination. All right, one more thing I wan to get into this segment, and that is, extraordinary emotional interview that Joe Biden had with Stephen Colbert on his new CBS late show. This is just a little piece of it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Two, they can look at the folks out there and say I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this. And I would be lying if I said that I knew I was there.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: As Biden grieves for his late son, even conservatives say this guy is very authentic and wears his emotions on his sleeve.HAYES: I think he's always been authentic. I think this is both a positive for Joe Biden and a negative for Joe Biden. He says what he thinks. Other people have drawn comparisons to Donald Trump. He's sort of -- Donald Trump maybe with more ideas or with a stronger ideology. He hasn't flipped as much as Trump has.KURTZ: Even though Biden is telling the world he's not there emotionally, the next day Politico has a story. Joe Biden insiders -- campaign taking shape, well, maybe but you need a candidate.MILBANK: Politico had two stories within 45 minutes of each other. One saying he's about to run and the other say there is no way possible. But I've always been inclined to take Joe Biden at his word, because he's authentic and he's not saying he's getting ready to run.KURTZ: Just briefly.ATTKISSON: Well, I think he's going to run, could be completely wrong. And I think one of the biggest things he has going for him is that authenticity as we described and that likeability. Top Democrats spoke to me this week and said, what else does he have except four more years of Obama, who the Democrats say has been extremely unpopular. Well, that's what he has. He has that persona.KURTZ: Venturing a prediction. Before we take a break, take a minute to talk about your new show, Full Measure which will debut on Sinclair Station on October 4th.ATTKISSON: That's right, half hour of investigative reporting. We're not trying to duplicate the other Sunday shows. We'll be doing whistle blower stories, government accountability, watchdog reporting, corporate malfeasance, all the things that I think the public wants to see more of.KURTZ: This is what you were trying to do at CBS?ATTKISSON: Yes, exactly. What I did for many years, but what I had more trouble getting on the air the last couple years.KURTZ: All right. Let me get a break here. Remember to send me a twitter message. Get on twitter and tweet me @HowardKurtz. What do you think about what we're talking about or the show or the media?When we come back, Hillary Clinton finally manages to say she's sorry with ABC's David Muir. Is that enough for the media?And later, we'll talk to Ben Carson about his surge in the polls and his apology for questioning Trump's faith.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: It took Hillary Clinton a long time to move from dismissing the email fiasco to finally apologizing with ABC's David Muir.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Did you wipe the server?CLINTON: With a cloth or something? No.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER: Is this an indication that this issue isn't going to go away for the remainder of your campaign.CLINTON: Nobody talked to me about it other than you guys.ANDREA MITCHELL, NBC NEWS: Are you sorry? Do you want to apologize to the American people for the choice you made?CLINTON: Well, it wasn't the best choice. And I certainly have said that. I will continue to say that.DAVID MUIR, ABC NEWS: When voters were asked what is the first word that comes to mind when you think of Hillary Clinton, words like liar, dishonest, untrustworthy were at the top of the list, does this tell you that your original explanation about the private server that you did it to carry one phone out of convenience that this didn't sit well with the American people?CLINTON: That was a mistake. I'm sorry about that. I take responsibility.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Steve Hayes, almost everyone in the media said Hillary had to apologize. She finally does. Many pundits say it wasn't enough. It wasn't sincere. She did it because of a focus group, your thoughts?HAYES: It wasn't enough. It wasn't sincere. She did it because of a focus group. You know they broadcast this to the New York Times. They told the New York Times that she was going to be changing her approach to the campaign and get a more authentic Hillary. There was this focus group. A couple days later she apologizes. What I think is most interesting and I think this hasn't been highlighted enough in the reporting on this is she changed her tone. She didn't change the substance of her argument. She said I'm sorry. This was a mistake. That's a change of tone. There's some contrition there. She didn't say this wasn't allowed. She didn't change substance of any of her arguments or of her defense on that, which I think is an interesting point.KURTZ: Since you put that New York article, headline, Hillary Clinton to show more humor and heart, aides say. Let me ask Dana Milbank. What do you make of officials, people that work for her on the record, announcing to the press another Hillary reinvention.MILBANK: I suggest that she should fire anybody who is suggesting that sort of thing rather than saying, candidate, why didn't you go out there and be spontaneous. Let's go to the New York Times and say we're going to orchestrate things so she can appear to be spontaneous. That's a disastrous thing.KURTZ: She'll be firing a lot of people -- everybody from the campaign manager on down.MILBANK: It would appear that she might want to start again just being herself. I have to say I don't get this whole apology thing, I mean you apology to somebody when you have insulted them or you stepped on their toe. She didn't do a wrong to the American people in that way. It was a stupid thing that she did. She is handled it extremely badly. I don't get the whole media obsession with getting people to apologize. I don't see what that gets you.KURTZ: Why don't you pick up on that?ATTKISSON: I call it the apology culture. And I think like Dana says most Americans are sick of that. It doesn't mean anything to them. The apology -- A, doesn't change the deed, and B, most Americans don't find politician's apology's sincere. They think it's another way of saying I'm sorry I got caught or I'm sorry that my poll numbers went down because of what I did.KURTZ: Well, I've been saying for a couple of months that Hillary needed to do more national television interviews as she once signaled after her kickoff at Roosevelt Island and talk about this. Instead she and her campaign appear to be in the bunker. And remember she said that -- we saw a bit of it there, there was a media-driven story, the campaign said it was nonsense, the campaign attacked the New York Times reporting, some discrepancies -- with some discrepancies that the FBI was looking into it. But now there's a full blown FBI investigation. So maybe there is something to apologize for.ATTKISSON: And does the apology matter? Despite the fact that she may have apologized or she may say the people are confused, I think the bigger picture that's upsetting to her detractors and critics is the fact that she plotted and even planned to start a private server that would be off the grid where she would then filter things, and then to erase the things only when the Benghazi Committee was being formed but much later to wipe everything clean.HAYES: I agree with Sharyl and Dana about the apology culture.(CROSSTALK)HAYES: But in this instance I think she really did have something to apologize for. A, because of what she did. She clearly set up this private server. It doesn't change anything other than the story. Now we're talking about the apology. So I agree with that. It doesn't change the story substantively. But I do think she has something to apologize for.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Does it help her now -- spontaneous Hillary Clinton to go on Ellen Degeneres' show to dance and Hillary saying I'm running for many reasons but one of them is that I'm a woman.MILBANK: Sure, go on the late shows and go on the Ellen show, just stop telegraphing everything you're doing and stop changing and having a different flavor every week because no matter what you are, you appear inauthentic. Actually she can be funny, she can be warm so just let her do it.KURTZ: Do it in front of cameras however. Dana Milbank, Steve Hayes, Sharyl Attkisson of Full Measure, thanks very much for stopping by this Sunday.Ahead, Laura Ingraham on why so many of her fellow conservatives commentators are denouncing Donald Trump.But up next, Joe Biden and Joe Biden among the lead-off guests for Stephen Colbert, what this tells us about the new late show.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Stephen Colbert made his Late Show debut this week, not just with the likes of George Clooney, but with Joe Biden and a highly emotional conversation with Joe Biden in the wake of his son's death.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: First of all, it's embarrassing this being about me. There are so many people, maybe some people in the audience, who have losses as severe as or worse than mine and didn't have the incredible support I have.COLBERT: It's going to be emotional for a lot of people if you don't run. And sir, I just want to say that I think that your experience and your example of suffering and service is something that would be sorely missed in the race.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us now from New York is Stephen Battaglio, Television and Media Writer for the Los Angeles Times. And Steve, does it help or possibly hurt Colbert that so much of his show in the first week has been about politics, Bush, Biden, a bit that he did about Trump.STEPHEN BATTAGLIO, LOS ANGELES TIMES TV AND MEDIA WRITER: I think it helps. I think he was a political satirist on Comedy Central and he was very comfortable with politics. You're launching a new show. You're still trying to kind of figure out what it is. I thought the show was a bit uneven the first week. But this is a zone that he's very comfortable in, in talking about politics. The nation is certainly very interested in it. He will get a lot of attention doing these interviews, while he figures out what he wants this new show to be. And look, as you know, everybody is really engaged in this campaign and talking about this campaign. He made news every day because of these interviews.KURTZ: Well, that doesn't hurt. Could he alienate part of the audience since Colbert obviously leans left? He was perfectly fair and polite to Jeb Bush but with that emotional Joe Biden, we saw him practically begging the Vice President to get into the race.BATTAGLIO: No question. He's a liberal guy. I think what makes him different is that he's a man of faith. I think one reason why he got Joe Biden to agree with this interview is that they are both serious Catholics. You know most late-night hosts -- if you ask who they worship, they're going to say Johnny Carson before they say Jesus Christ. Stephen Colbert is really different. I think that gives him a certain dimension, and I think a lot of the audience that may not necessarily agree with him because of his politics will like that about him, they'll that there's something there that they can connect with just as Joe Biden connected with him.KURTZ: I can't imagine any other late-night hosts having that serious and emotional conversation with a potential presidential candidate, Vice President of the United States. Of course Colbert himself lost part of his family including his father in a plane crash when he was ten years old and he brought that up and the two connected on that. The contrast with Jimmy Fallon, Trump did the Tonight Show Friday night, and Fallon dressed up as Trump and did a funny shtick, but it wasn't the same serious conversation. Which brings me to a different race, the ratings race, given what you have seen from this week, his humor, his focus on politics, can Colbert beat or be competitive with Jimmy Fallon and with Jimmy Kimmel?BATTAGLIO: He had a very big first night because of all the promotion. Jimmy Fallon won the rest of the week and he had a very big night on Friday because of Donald Trump. I think that right now he has the audience that he had at comedy central, I think they followed him over. The question is you going to be able to broaden that out. Now let's remember, there hasn't been a lot of great lead-in in prime time shows in repeats and low rated summer programs. So he'll have a new fresh fall lineup that will promote it and will get more people to sample it, and I think that you do have to be different. I think that's one thing. He has to find a place here. You don't have to be number one to be a very successful businessman.KURTZ: Right. I have got to go but you're right, why do the same act as everyone else. Stephen Battaglio, good to see you this Sunday. Thanks for coming by.Ahead, Laura Ingraham on why some conservative commentators are giving Donald Trump a harder time than the liberal crowd.But first, my conversation with Ben Carson about the media, his faith and his verbal fisticuffs with Donald Trump.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Ben Carson did something usual the other day. He threw a hard jab when a reporter asked what differentiates him from Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARSON: I don't in any way deny my faith in God. And I think that probably is a big differential.UNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: Can you expand on that? You don't believe his faith is sincere when he's made comments about it?CARSON: I haven't heard it. I haven't seen it.TRUMP: Frankly he looks like he -- he makes Bush like the energizer bunny. Who is he to question my faith when I -- he doesn't even know me. I met him a few times. But I don't know Ben Carson. He was a doctor, perhaps an ok doctor by the way.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: I spoke to the Doctor earlier from St. Louis.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Ben Carson, welcome.CARSON: Thank you.KURTZ: After your dust up with Donald Trump -- and we're not going to re- litigate it here, you told the Washington Post the media frequently want to goad people into wars, into gladiator fights. Are you saying that's what happened here because it was your words of course that were replayed again and again?CARSON: I shouldn't have taken the bait. In fact, they asked two, three, four times -- you know what's the difference? And you know I should have just let it go.KURTZ: Just one follow-up on this after you did question Donald Trump's faith. You -- talked to the Washington Post and you apologized and you said if he took it as a personal attack you were sorry. Most candidates try to avoid apologizing. Isn't a campaign about contrasts?CARSON: Well, you know if I did something wrong, I will always admit it. And that was an arena that I really shouldn't have gone into. Certainly should never question someone's faith. That's between them and God.KURTZ: I think a lot of people find that refreshing, saying that you did something wrong and you are sorry. You have said that the press in covering this campaign has distorted things at times against Republicans since you're going to get more media scrutiny now that you're rising in the polls, will this a big obstacle for you?CARSON: I don't think so. You know I'm perfectly happy to face intense scrutiny. The good thing is there are no skeletons for anybody to find, and all I have to do is continue to tell the truth. I don't have to try to remember what I said three months ago. And it really takes a lot of the stress out of it.KURTZ: Telling the truth certainly is easier. Now you were in Ferguson on Friday talking about race relations. You wrote in USA Today that the Democratic Party shouldn't tell black people they need government to feed and clothe and house them, and that the Republican Party has ignored black people for too long. So is the GOP part of the problem?CARSON: There's no question that the GOP has a very excellent opportunity by paying attention to some of the communities that they have neglected, and informing them about the history of the GOP. And in fact, a party that was formed as a party that worked hard to get gun rights for freed men, a party that pushed civil rights and voting rights and many luminary figures in the black community has been members of the Republican Party. A party that should push for hard work and self-reliance and mechanisms for removing oneself from a state of dependency to becoming a part of the fabric of America.KURTZ: Right. You have tried to deemphasize race. You said in Ferguson that a lot of people see things through racial eyes, but it doesn't have to be that way. That's a great aspiration. But you're running for the nomination of a party that has between one and seven percent of the black vote in the last four presidential elections. How much can you do to change that?CARSON: Well, you know I believe that black people just like any other people in our country are listening. They are looking for solutions. And they're not going to just blindly follow someone because they say do I what tell you to do. So I believe that if we actually pay attention to them and we actually explain to them the mechanisms whereby we're going to get business and industry and academia and Wall Street and churches and community groups to invest in people, recognizing that for every person that we can keep from going down the wrong pathway, that's one more productive member of society who may discover a new energy source or a cure for cancer.KURTZ: Dr. Carson, you made mistakes in early interviews in this campaign. You likened ObamaCare to slavery, you talked about homosexuality being a choice because you said some men went into prison and came out gay. And then you stopped doing that. Why did you tone down your rhetorical approach?CARSON: Because I discovered that people were not able to hear what I was actually saying. They would hone in on key phrases and these would be things that would be hyped by various people. They would never actually be able to hear what I was saying. So I learned how to get my message across without the hyperbole.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: More of my conversation with Ben Carson after a quick break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: My conversation with Ben Carson soon turned to religion.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Let's talk a little bit about your faith. You told me a while back that you felt called to run -- that you were going to retire to your nice home in Florida and that you said to God if you'll open the doors, I will walk through them. Have you always been this way and do you worry at all that this might be a bit off-putting to people who don't have a deep religious faith.CARSON: Well, you know I believe everybody is entitled to the beliefs that they want to have. And that's why the first amendment is so important, freedom of religion. People who say that religion has nothing to do with their life probably don't know exactly what religion is. You know, just because you don't necessarily believe in God or Jesus doesn't mean that you don't have a religion. Even atheism is a religion. You have something that you believe in without complete evidence that it exists, and it does inform who you are and informs how you think and how you relate to other people. And we need to always protect freedom of religion.KURTZ: And as a non-politician and as a longtime pediatric neurosurgeon, you have a special appeal in this campaign and you have risen to second place in most polls, but no one has ever won a competitive primary without throwing some punches and counterpunching when they're attacked. Now you're kind of a soft-spoken guy. Do you have to do that? Are you willing to do that?CARSON: I don't feel any need to really get into the mud to get into the wrestling match. What I do feel a need to do is to talk about the actual issues. Talk about the actual solutions, because I believe our country is actually in a lot of trouble. I believe that's the only reason that I have gotten into this race. That's the only reason that a person like me would even gain traction, because there are enough people who recognize that it is in fact the case. And that we're not necessarily looking for traditional politics. We're looking for people who have a history of solving complex problems, and of utilizing the resources and the people around them in order to get that done.KURTZ: Just briefly, is it hard to get attention for talking about the issues given all of the media static out there about the flap of the day?CARSON: It does become difficult sometimes when dealing with the media. But that's one of the reasons that I spend a lot of time out there amongst the people. And I've been out there amongst the people for many years actually. It's been a tremendous advantage to me because people had an opportunity to hear me in person, and to see who I really am as opposed to who I'm portrayed as by some people who perhaps have different motives.KURTZ: Dr. Ben Carson thanks very much for joining us.CARSON: Always a pleasure. Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Coming up, Laura Ingraham on why talk radio is a more sympathetic venue for Donald Trump than the conservative media elite, and later David Gregory breaks his silence about being ousted at Meet the Press.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Donald Trump may be under attack by big-time conservative commentators, but he gets a more sympathetic hearing on talk radio. I sat down with Laura Ingraham, a Syndicated Radio Host, Fox News Contributor, and Founder of the new website Lifezet here in Studio One.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Laura Ingraham, Welcome. You've had Donald Trump on your show. Is he getting a better reception on talk radio than in the rest of the conservative media?LAURA INGRAHAM, SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: When he came on my show after the Fox Debate, I think it like -- what's up with these late-night tweets. How is this helpful? It was the fox truce called after that. I'm going to ask all of the guy's tough questions. And I can't speak for other radio hosts. I know we had name that terrorist question from another radio host. So every host does things differently. I think talk radio has been the people's medium. We've taken on immigration and trade and a lot of us for many years and gone back to the Bush administration in 2007. So these issues that Trump is talking about, Santorum is talking about, Huckabee is talking about, we are hitting. We have been hitting. To that extent, yeah, he steps in it and we're on it.KURTZ: Let's talk about some other voices on the right. Charles Krauthammer says the conservatives should be alarmed at what Trump is doing to the GOP. George Will calls him a counterfeit Republican. Jonah Goldberg says conservative voters are throwing away the cause and have peaked. What do you make of this?INGRAHAM: I like all those boys. But as Craig Shirley, Reagan Biographer mentioned on my show recently, usually Krauthammer and George Will -- I think in the `70s there was some criticisms of Ronald Reagan and he was challenging the establishment back then, and before everybody says Trump is Reagan, he is challenging the establishment and that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. I don't know where Trump will go, but the idea that some internecine warfare among conservatives is going to matter to most people, it's not. Most people want to know is my life going to get better. Why are we dealing all these deals where we get completely hosed by China and all these other nations that are cheating, and why are we allowing millions people into the country when we have millions of underprivileged people without work and homeless about 300 yards from the studio right now.KURTZ: You don't think it hurts, or does it in some ways help that Trump is under media attack even from people who are on the right who don't see him running as a movement conservative?INGRAHAM: I think people have to be honest brokers about this. Where are the middle class today, the middle income earners in this country haven't gotten a raise in about 16 or 17 years, and that pre-dates, of course, the Obama administration, so I think until people realize there's a lot of bad feelings about you know, second Bush term and what happened there, I think they are just going to you know, keep kind of banging their heads against the wall against Trump. This is really not about Trump. This is about the Republican establishment failing most of those middle income workers who put all their hopes in the Republican Party, so if they cleaned up their own house over at the GOP, Trump probably wouldn't be as big as he is now or might not even be a factor at all.KURTZ: Now I wrote a column the other day saying Trump was becoming more of a politician, and I meant it in a positive sense. Being a little more restrained and throwing fewer bombs. And then Rolling Stone piece comes out and he says Carly Fiorina, look at that face, who would vote for that face? Does that undermine him because it gets so much media attention?INGRAHAM: It gets media attention of course, because people don't want to talk about the two issues that he's really talking about, his trade work for the United States and his immigration and that positive -- what is it going to mean we've taken in 10,000...(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: I'd say to whether it's Jeb Bush, putting in kind on anemic performance on Colbert or Marco Rubio -- not doing the best he can on some issues, don't give your critics more ammunition if you can avoid it. So why bother? I think Donald Trump could probably say a lot of things about the other candidates that would be true but would not be disrespectful and, you know, he's kind of a shoot from the hip kind of guy.KURTZ: I've noticed.INGRAHAM: That serves him well. I certainly wouldn't given him a lot of advice he's probably taken just on his own and it's done really well for him. But I think in the end if people think he's going to make their life better and they're going to have more money in their pocket, I think you know, he can go pretty far with this.KURTZ: It cuts through all the spit ball fights.You recently launched a website called Lifezet, and I've been reading it, it's not just politics. I've seen stories on happy and holy marriages and watermelon recipes, what's the concept?INGRAHAM: It's a lifestyle site for the rest us. So politics is a very small part of most people's lives and we don't want to believe that here. But it's a very small sideline to most people. Most people are worried about taking care of their aging parents, they're worried about dementia risks, how to get their kids into a school. What if their kid has anxiety in math class, like how to deal with this stuff? We try to explain all these complicated challenging things that we all face in our lives and make it really fun. So we're making from parenting to faith to pop culture and to health and politics, trying to explain it and make it fun in a reason visual experience for people.KURTZ: A section for moms -- aimed a little bit more at women.INGRAHAM: A little bit more at women. We'll have a dad set ultimately. But it's all parenting. But as a mother of three young children, Howie, you have young kids, you're always trying to keep up, and I kind of channel my own you know, challenges into the site and we have lots of great contributors. It's a big team, so I'm kind of the overseer, but it's a big team and we're having a great time so far, we're doing well so far.KURTZ: Equal time for dads.INGRAHAM: Don't worry, Howie. You'll be the first feature.KURTZ: Laura Ingraham thanks very much for stopping by.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Still to come, your top tweets of course, and this disgusting move by a journalist covering the Syrian refugee. Why isn't an anti-Scott Walker reporter covering his campaign and David Gregory speaks out about being dumped by NBC.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: I'm buzzed off about this. One of the lowest things I've ever seen in journalism in covering the heartbreaking surge of Syrian refugees trying to flee the country. A camera woman for a Hungarian station N1TV became part of the story. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: That's right. Petra Laszlo actually tripped a man carrying a child and running away from the police. Why? To create more drama and one journalist posted a photo of Laszlo tripping a child refugee. Laszlo apologized by claiming she was trying to defend herself but come on. The station has now fired her for her awful conduct as a human being.And this media fail, Madeline Bair, a reporter who covers Scott Walker for USA Today signed a petition in 2011 to recall the governor from office. A publisher of another Gannett paper in Appleton, Wisconsin where she's based had called that a violation of ethical standards. A Gannett executive told the American Mirror that Bair's coverage was fair and she had told the company about the petition. So what, she ought to be taken off the beat.Your top tweets. Did the media spend too much time on Trump versus Carly's face, Trump versus Ben Carson on faith?Iowan Politics, you can't help it. You need Trump as much as he needs you. He said I have to keep saying things so they will keep covering me, haven't seen that.Conservatorium Prop, they spend too much time on Trump period. His bombastic comments are shining objects to capture the media's attention.Jeffrey H. McLaughlin, are any of the candidates debating complicated cultural issues, not the media's fault and Americans love a food fight.Ivan, kudos for navigating the treacherous waters between the two Trump haters, partisan hacks on our panel and Sharyl Attkisson a brilliant journalist.All right, NBC let David Gregory twist in the wind for months before dumping him as moderator of ""Meet the Press."" Gregory is now out with a memoir, and he talks about why NBC executives never let him say good-bye.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID GREGORY: NBC was concerned if they let me have a last show to thank the audience that I was going to somehow go after them and you know...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They called it an Ann Curry moment.GREGORY: The Today Show and they wanted to avoid that. That was never going to happen so they -- they leaked the fact that -- that they made a decision for me to go.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Of course, the reference to Ann Curry's painfully teary farewell when Today Show dropped her. The executives have the right to replace a guy who wasn't delivering the ratings but their treatment of Gregory was pretty shabby.That's it for this edition of ""MediaBuzz."" I'm Howard Kurtz.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" March 20, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.  Europe's most wanted man is captured alive.  What will he tell authorities about ISIS plots against the West?(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  We'll have a live report from Europe and we'll ask the White House chief of staff Denis McDonough what the arrest means for the U.S. war on terror.  Then, the showdown over the president's Supreme Court nominee.  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have fulfilled my constitutional duty.  Now, it's time for the Senate to do theirs.  SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY, MAJORITY LEADER:  This nominee is not going to be considered.  WALLACE:  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says Judge Merrick Garland won't get a hearing or a vote.  But the White House argues the Senate should do its job, not wait until after the election.Today, McConnell and McDonough face off on ""Fox News Sunday.""  Plus, Governor John Kasich wins his home state of Ohio and vows to press on in his campaign for president.  GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You better believe it's about America.  It's about pulling us together, not pulling us apart.  WALLACE:  We'll ask the GOP candidate what's his path to the nomination?  Amidst talk of a contested convention.  Plus, we'll ask our Sunday panel about the Republicans' plan to stop Trump.  And our power players of the week, baby bald eagles steal the spotlight.All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  We begin with the capture and questioning of most wanted man in Europe, Salah Abdeslam, believed to be the sole fugitive from the Paris massacre four months ago that killed 130 people.  In a moment, we'll get reaction from White House chief of staff Denis McDonough on this and the other big news this week, the president's Supreme Court nomination.  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is also standing by on.  But first, let's bring in Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall in London with the latest on the terror investigation -- Benjamin.  BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Chris.Well, Abdeslam could be an intelligent gold mine.  And today, French and Belgium authorities are looking closely in what happened in the lead-up to those Paris attacks, but also how he was able to evade capture so long hidden under their noses.  It was a bullet to the knee that ended his four months on the run during raids on Friday in which he and four others were arrested.  He's now being charged with participation in a terrorist murder.  France quickly issued a new arrest warrant with more charges to speed up his extradition but the process may still take up to three months.  Investigators into the Paris attacks now hope Abdeslam will reveal information about the ISIS network behind him.  He's confessed already to Belgian prosecutors that he planned to blow himself up that night but he changed his mind.  Prosecutors also claim that leading up to the attack, he traveled around Europe picking up other attackers and that he was the one who bought hydrogen peroxide to make the explosives.  His lawyer said was cooperating.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SVEN MARY, SALAH ABDESLAM'S LAWYER:  There is a collaboration with the Belgium justice.  Let's go further on with that collaboration.  I think it's very important that he talks with the judge, which is a very good judge.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HALL:  Abdeslam was finally caught just 500 yards from his parents' home, the place he grew up.  He was tracked down when a friend called the police and passed on the cell phone number that he was using.  Today, the Belgium interior minister said he was shocked at the level of support he received while on the run.  It was a lot higher than previously expected.  And so now, the hunt is on for anyone else still out there who may want to commit attacks -- Chris.  WALLACE:  Benjamin Hall, reporting from London, Benjamin, thanks for that.Now let's get reaction to the arrest from White House chief of staff Denis McDonough.Mr. McDonough, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""DENIS MCDONOUGH, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  Thanks for having me, Chris.WALLACE:  What's the significance of Abdeslam's capture?  What is it going to help us do in terms of stopping future ISIS terror attacks?  MCDONOUGH:  Well, it's important because it sends a very strong message that our allies and we in support of them are not going to stop until we get all the facts of this case figured out.  And now I know there will be an intensive process to figure out what he knows and what he did and what he knows about what others may be doing.  And that's why it's important that we dig very hard into this case and why the president called the French president and the Belgium prime minister on Friday to commend them for this good work.  WALLACE:  What have we heard from European authorities?  We know that he is said some stuff to Belgian prosecutors.  But do we know whether or not in fact he is cooperating, the degree to his cooperation?  And what about an electronic trail that he may have left through cell phones or other devices that we can begin to follow?  MCDONOUGH:  Well, I don't have any news to make on that this morning, Chris.  But I do know that people are looking at that very closely in Europe, and I'm sure we'll know more about that in the days and weeks to come.  WALLACE:  What are we learning both from this and from the prior investigation over the last four months about the extent of the ISIS terror network in Europe?  Just how many operatives they have there?  How extensive it is?MCDONOUGH:  Well, we do know that they say and we have to listen to what they say.  They say that they intend to do this again.  So, we take that very seriously.  Now, we are trying to draw lessons from exactly what happened on that terrible night in Paris, to make sure that not only our friends ready but they're well-trained.  And that we're sharing the kind of intelligence and training with them that we can.  And that's exactly what we're doing.  WALLACE:  And do we believe that the attack on Paris that Abdeslam was involved in, do we believe it was directed and planned by ISIS central in the Middle East, or do we think it was simply inspired and self-radicalized people were involved?  MCDONOUGH:  Well, we believe that there are indications that in fact that it goes back to some of those folks back in the Middle East.  But we're going to go -- get to bottom of this story.  But what we're not going to do is let our guard down.  That means staying on offense against ISIL in Syria and Iraq.  And that's why we've done precisely that over the course of these last many months.  We'll continue to that, Chris, because we're not going to sit and wait.  We're going to go get this.  WALLACE:  Mr. McDonough, I'm going to ask you stand by for a moment.  The other big news this week is the president's pick for the Supreme Court Judge Merrick Garland.  Senate Republicans have vowed not to hold hearings or vote on the nomination and let the next president fill the seat.  We'll get Mr. McDonough's reaction in a moment.  But, first, Senate Majority Mitch McConnell joins me from Louisville.  Senator, support for your hard line on the Garland nomination seems to be breaking, at least a half a dozen Republican senators have now said they're going to meet with Garland, and late this week, Illinois Senator Mark Kirk said this, ""Just man up and cast a vote.""It's been only four days and it seems like your ranks are breaking, sir.  MCCONNELL:  Well, Senator Kirk is a terrific senator.  He's running for reelection this year and he's going to be re-elected in November.  I think what we need to focus on is the principle, the principle.  Who ought to make this appointment?  You have to go back 80 years to find the last time a vacancy on the Supreme Court created in a presidential election year was filled.  You have to go back to 1888 when Grover Cleveland was in the White House to find the last time when a vacancy was created in a presidential year, a Senate controlled about it party opposite the president confirmed.  The Senate has a role to play here.  The president nominates, we decide to confirm.  We think the important principle in the middle of this presidential election, which is raging, is that American people need to weigh in and decide who's going to make this decision.  Not this lame duck president on the way out the door, but the next president next year.WALLACE:  But you talk about principle, anything that happens in Washington involves principle and politics.  And what we see with Mark Kirk is a senator or Republican senator up in a tough re-election battle and thinking this is a hard line to hold.  And I guess I've got to ask you, isn't this going to be a hard argument to make over the next seven months?  If you're going to say the president can't decide something, can't get his nomine confirmed because it's an election year, couldn't you say the same thing about the U.S. Senate that you shouldn't pass any laws?  You shouldn't do anything because in a sense you're a lame duck Congress?  MCCONNELL:  No, he shouldn't.  I mean, we're following the Biden rule.  And Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1992, in presidential election year; he said the Senate should not act on filling a Supreme Court vacancy if it had occurred that year.  Harry Reid when he was back in 2005 said the president nominates but the Senate doesn't have to vote.  Chuck Schumer who will be the next Democratic leader said in 2007 they wouldn't confirm.  The Democrats were in the majority in the Senate, they wouldn't confirm a Bush appointment to the Supreme Court if one occurred within 18 moves a presidential election.  So, all we're doing, Chris, is following a long standing tradition of not filling vacancies on the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election year.  WALLAC:  I am going to ask Mr. McDonough about the Biden rule in a moment.  But, frankly, isn't there a fair amount of hypocrisy on both sides here?  Right now, President Obama is calling for an up or down vote on his nominee.  You oppose that.  But back in 2005 when George W. Bush was president, you made exactly the same argument that Obama's making now.  Take a look, sir.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCCONNELL:  In a democracy, an up or down vote should be given to a president's judicial nominees.  It's not complicated.  It's simple.  It's fair.  It worked for 229 years.  And it has served us well.  (END VIDSEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Senator, if an up or down vote for a judicial nominee was simple, fair, and a principle that has served us for 229 years -- I guess now it's over 230 years now -- if that's true then, it is still true?  MCCONNELL:  Yes.  We're talking apples and oranges.  That comment was not in connection with the Supreme Court vacancy.What we're talking about here here's a factual situation --WALLACE:  But it's still a judicial nominee, sir.MCCONNELL:  The Supreme Court -- no, they're not the same.  The Supreme Court is very different from the other courts.  What we're talking about here is a Supreme Court vacancy in the middle of a presidential election year made by a lame duck president who is on the way out the door and the impact that will have on this court for the next quarter of a century.  That is the issue before us right now.  WALLACE:  Some of your Republican colleagues are already suggesting that if your side, if the GOP loses the election in November, that perhaps they would consider Judge Garland in a lame duck session because, in fact, he might be more moderate than, let's say, Hillary Clinton's nominee would be.  Here is Republican Senator Jeff Flake.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JEFF FLAKE, R-ARIZ., JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  I think Republicans are fully justified in doing what we're doing -- waiting.  And -- but if we happen to lose the election, then I think we ought to push him through quickly if we can.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Senator, is Jeff Flake wrong?  MCCONNELL:  Yes, I think so.  Look, Barack Obama calling judge -- this judge a moderate doesn't make him a moderate.  This judge would move the court dramatically to the left.  He's enthusiastically supported by MoveOn.org.  I don't think they would be signing up and have all this enthusiasm about a liberal judge.  Look, the principle is the same.  Whether it's before the election or after the election, the principle is the American people are choosing their next president and their next president should pick this Supreme Court nominee.  WALLACE:  So, final question -- just to make it clear -- you're saying no consider -- no consideration of Judge Garland by this Congress even if Hillary Clinton wins the election?  No consideration by this Congress?  You're going to stand firm on that even in a lame duck session?  MCCONNELL:  Yes.  I can't imagine that a Republican majority in the United States Senate would want to confirm in a lame duck session a nominee opposed by the National Rifle Association, the National Federation of Independent Business that represents small businesses that have never taken a position on the Supreme Court appointment before.  They're opposed to this guy.  I can't imagine that a Republican majority Senate, even if it were assumed to be a minority, would want to confirm a judge that would most court dramatically to the left.  That's not going to happen.  WALLACE:  Senator McConnell, thank you.  Thanks for your time today, sir.  MCCONNELL:  Thank you.  WALLACE:  Now let's bring back the White House chief of staff Denis McDonough to talk about the Supreme Court battle.  Mr. McDonough, President Obama is calling now for an up or down vote on the nomination of Merrick Garland.  Back in 2006, senator Obama participated in the filibuster of Sam Alito's nomination, blocking an up and down vote.  And back in 1992, Joe Biden when he was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said the Senate should not consider a Supreme Court nomination in an election year.  Let's watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, THEN-U.S. SENATOR:  The Senate Judiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until ever -- until after the political campaign season is over.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Question, aren't Obama and Biden making exactly the opposite argument now from what they made back then?  DENIS MCDONOUGH, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  Chris, you said Sam Alito, you mean Justice Alito.  WALLACE:  Yes.  MCDONOUGH:  Who has been it is sitting on the Supreme Court for the last ten years.  WALLACE:  But Obama tried to filibuster him.  MCDONOUGH:  So he's been on the court for the last decade.  President Obama did not object to a hearing, did not object to private meetings, and did not object to votes including in the committee and then ultimately on the floor of the Senate.  WALLACE:  Well, he tried to filibuster him.  MCDONOUGH:  And when you think of Senator -- Vice President Biden and the role he played as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, nine Supreme Court justices came before him when he was chairman.  Everyone was given a hearing, meetings, a vote, and even when they were not enough votes in the committee to pass him with that justice with majority vote, they still went to the Senate floor this vote at the full Senate.  That's exactly what we think should happen here.  WALLACE:  But -- you could -- a lot of those things happened either in spite of or over their opposition.  MCDONOUGH:  On the contrary, he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.  Thing don't happen in the judiciary committee over or in spite of the objection of the chairman.  In fact, it happens because the chairman makes it happen.  Vice President Biden ensured that every one of those justices had a hearing, including, by the way in, 1988, an election year when President Reagan proposed a Republican president, proposed a Democratic Senate a Supreme Court justice.  And in fact, Justice Kennedy who has now been on the court since 1988 was passed overwhelmingly, in fact, unanimously by the Senate.  We think the same thing should happen for Judge Garland.  WALLACE:  Do you think that the Senate has a constitutional obligation to take this up to vote?  MCDONOUGH:  We think that it's quite clear in the Constitution that when there is a vacancy, the president proposes a nominee and we think as been the practice for decades, in fact, centuries in the Senate that advise and consent means meetings, public hearing where that judge -- in this case, Judge Garland -- is willing to go under oath on national television and answer their questions and then a vote in the committee and a vote in the Senate.  That's what should happen here.  WALLACE:  But ""The Washington Post"" did a fact check.  They actually gave that idea that there is a constitutional obligation three Pinocchios.  They said, first of all, the Constitution says nothing about a vote.  It says advice and consent before a confirmation.  And secondly, there has been a long history, mostly in the 19th century, that the Senate has decided not to act in a number of cases.  MCDONOUGH:  Look, Chris, we don't need to jump back to the 19th century or the 1800s, right?  We're in the 21st century.  What we ought to do is look at the precedent over the course of the last many decades and as was the case on Vice President Biden was chairman of the committee, every nominee got a hearing, got meetings, got votes and committee and got a vote on the floor.  There is not difficult.  This is the way it operates in the Senate and they ought not to reach back to the precedent from 1800s.  Let's just do the way they've been doing it for a long, long time.WALLACE:  As we discussed with Senator McConnell, several Republican senators are now saying that they're willing to meet with Judge Garland and Illinois Republican Senator Mark Kirk is saying that they should just man up and vote.  How big an issue do you think that you can make this in the November election?  How much heat, honestly, do you think can you put on Senate Republicans?  MCDONOUGH:  Well, like we don't think there is an election issue.  We think this is a straight up governance issue.  This is what -- you know, when Senator McConnell --WALLACE:  Wait.  The president, you, you're all meeting and mobilizing various groups on your side.  There is nothing wrong with it being a political issue.  I mean, you're trying to put heat on these people.  MCDONOUGH:  You just asked what -- how big an issue it will be in the election?  This can be resolved.  The average time from announcement of a nomination to confirmation is 67 days.  We do feel good about the progress we're making.  In fact, Senator Collins has indicated to us that she'll meet --  WALLACE:  Susan Collins of Maine, Republican.MCDONOUGH:  Correct, the Republican of Maine has indicated that she'll meet with Judge Garland after the Senate gets back from the two week break.  Earlier in the week, they get back.So, we think that's good progress.  We'll continue to make that progress.  And again, this shouldn't be an issue in any election.  They can resolve of this in plenty of time and in the time they have.  In fact, we believe there is consistent with the pledges that Senate McConnell made when he took over the Senate.  You'll recall that he said he wanted to get Congress working again.  Well, getting Congress working again would mean just obviously giving him a hearing, a vote, and getting this ton.  Not taking this unprecedented step.  WALLACE:  One final question -- some Republican senators say, look, if the Democrats end up winning the White House in November, let's say Hillary Clinton, well, then maybe we'll consider Judge Garland in a lame duck session.Question: has the president made a commitment to garland that he'll stand about it nomination or might he, let's say Clinton wins in November, might he pull the nomination and let her pick the next Supreme Court justice?  MCDONOUGH:  The president will stand by his nominee.  This is an unbelievably qualified, extraordinarily decent man who comes to this nomination with more federal court experience than any nominee before him.  He led our effort into the investigation and prosecution for the Oklahoma City bombing, the Unabomber and he's just as you've seen in the stories, an extraordinarily decent man.  We'll stand by him from now until he is confirmed and he is sitting on the Supreme Court.  WALLACE:  Through the end of the president's term?  MCDONOUGH:  That is correct.  WALLACE:  Mr. McDonough, thank you.  Thanks you for coming in.  Always good to talk with you, sir.  MCDONOUGH:  Thanks so much, Chris.  WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss Judge Garland's nomination.  Plus, what you would like to the panel about the Supreme Court battle?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  For a judge to be worthy of such trust, he or she must be faithful to the Constitution, and to those statutes passed by the Congress.  He or she must put aside his personal views or preferences and follow the law, not make it.(END VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Merrick Garland, chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals here in Washington, speaking at the White House this week after President Obama nominated him to the Supreme Court.And it's time now for our Sunday group: Syndicated columnist George Will, Lisa Lerer, who covers politics for The Associated Press, Washington Examiner columnist and conservative pollster, Kristen Soltis Anderson, and Bob Woodward of ""The Washington Post"".So, George, your thoughts about the Garland nomination and the stand that Republicans are taking in the Senate -- no confirmation hearing, no vote.GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  The Republicans have two reasons for taking a position.  One is to demonstrate to the Republican base something that they very much doubt which is there is some reason to want the Republicans to control the Senate.  They can't defund Planned Parenthood.  They can't repeal Obamacare.  They can't even prevent the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.  This they can stand up and say we can actually do something.  Second, this is a way they say of protesting executive overreach by the president, although this is a clear constitutional right and duty of the president to nominate people to the federal judiciary.  What's puzzling is the Republican Senate leaders who are saying this have all said, of course, they will support Donald Trump if he's the nominee.  So, they're saying, we're quite content to have judicial nominations made by Mr. Trump whose qualifications for so doing are somewhat foggy.  And it's puzzling to hear Mitch McConnell saying, with reverence, that we must follow the Biden Rule.  A Biden Rule endorsed with equal reverence by Harry Reid.  The Biden rule was he said no confirmations during a political season.  When are we not in a political season?  It's just not an election year.  Where -- by what principle do we decide when a president's ability to nominate people becomes progressively attenuated?  After the midterm elections of the second term of a president?  When is it?  I don't understand.  WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel.  And following up on the point that George made, we got this from Rob Danger.  He tweeted this: ""Will Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell keep his word or fold like he usually does?""Kristen, at a time -- and I want to pick up on this question of trying to keep faith with the base.  At a time when grassroots support for the Republican leadership here in Washington is at all-time low, when can you just see this in this election, how little they trust that the D.C. establishment, the Republican D.C. establishment is going to stand up for them, is this an effective way for McConnell to try to mobilize the base?  And do you think he's going to be able -- we're already seeing that first crack with Mark Kirk -- can he keep the soldiers in line?  KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, WASHINGTON EXAMINER COLUMNIST:  Remember that Mitch McConnell came out with a strategy pretty much the day that vacancy came open.  He knew that if there was even a hypothetical that this would be the sort of thing where Senate Republicans might entertain the president's nominee, might allow the court to move to the left, that there would be outrage.  So, he sort of wanted to shut that down right away.  But look at the members of the Senate who are beginning to say, I'd be at least willing to have a meeting with this nominee.  They are Republicans who are up for re-election and they are in seats where it is a blue or a purple state.  There are states that unlikely to vote for a Republican nominee in a presidential election.  And maybe to differentiate themselves from the national party narrative so that they, at the same time that their state is perhaps voting for a Democratic candidate at the top of the ticket, is still sending them back to Washington a little bit further down on the ballot.  WALLACE:  Bob, I thought that the White House chief of staff Denis McDonough made some news in our interview here.  Went further than the White House has so far in saying that Obama is going to stick by the Garland nomination even into a lame duck, even if, let's say, Hillary Clinton is elected president that he would stick by the Garland nomination.  Kind of interesting that he's saying, you know, I'm going to stay by him and if Hillary Clinton, even if he's just been elected president, if they want to confirm my nominee, so be it.  BOB WOODWARD, THE WASHINGTON POST:  I think it's confusing to people, because this is all about politics.  This is pure politics on both sides and as you pointed out, hypocrisy on both sides.  WALLACE:  Both sides argued exactly the opposite side.  WOODWARD:  Exactly.  And what McConnell, the Senate majority leader is saying, hey, look, we -- and it's the advice and consent provision in the Constitution.  We can do it any way we want.  And he's actually quite right.  There is nothing in the Constitution that says you have to do it in a timely fashion and so forth.  So, this -- this -- the issue is whether you can make the court a majority liberal body.  Everyone concedes that if garland goes on the court, you're going to have five votes on the liberal side.  What is interesting and George has pointed this out -- I mean, Garland is an extraordinary judge.  He is somebody -- I did a book years ago on the Supreme Court and tried to follow it since, and he's exactly the sort of person that should be on the court.  He's reasonable.  He listens.  He is not really partisan in anyway.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  But wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You know what a lot of people are going to say is when it comes down to a decision and it's 5-4, he'll end up being with the liberal judges as opposed to the conservative justices.  WOODWARD:  He will.  But, you know, look, step back.  There will be liberals and conservatives on the court and if you are going to have some liberals have the sensible -- have rational person.I mean, like lots of people said about Scalia, they didn't agree with him, but he served an important function on the court.  That's the way it works.  You have to be a consensus builder and Garland is somebody like.  But I don't think he's going to make it.  I don't think he's going to be confirmed.  WALLACE:  Lisa, let's pick up open this from the political side of the Democrats.  Democratic aspect, they clearly feel that this argument, ""do your job"" -- you're there.  You're there for another eight months or whatever it is.  And the idea that you're simply going to refuse to have a hearing, refuse to vote.When you talk to the Sanders and Clinton camps, do they think this is effective?  And do they it will move votes in the fall election?  LISA LERER, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  Yes, it was interesting to hear Denis McDonough tell you it's not an election year issue, because that's clearly not how Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders see this.  They think it is an effective issue.  They'll need to do two things in the fall, rally their base and pull over independents.  They think they can allow them to do both.  It's a strong motivator for base Democrats, particularly African-Americans, who tend to view a lot of these Republican opposition to the president through a racial lens.They also think if Trump is at the top of the Republican ticket, they may be able to pull over some moderate Republicans who may not like the idea of Donald Trump next -- picking the next Supreme Court justice, particularly as Democrats like to point out, he said that his sister would be an excellent justice and she has a record of being very pro-abortion rights.  So, they think this is -- this is an area where they can make a really strong political argument.  The politics get a little more complicated once you get into a lame duck session, because quite frankly, Merrick Garland is not the nominee that I think Hillary Clinton would like to choose in her first time.WALLACE:  She'd like somebody more liberal.  LERER:  Yes, a lot of the liberal groups feel that way.  That's why you see them focusing on the need for a vote and not really talking all that much about the nominee, and certainly not saying whether they would keep him and renominate him should either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders win the presidency.  WALLACE:  So, George, in less than a minute we have left in the segment, what about the lame duck scenario?  That Hillary Clinton wins or Donald Trump wins and some of those Republicans say, ""You know what?  Merrick Garland doesn't look like such a bad nominee.""WILL:  You know, if President Cruz is president-elect the morning after the election, the Republicans' choice is clear.  You wait for him to make a nominee. If Trump is the president-elect, I don't know how you guess who he might want to put on the court. But suppose in the morning after the election it's president-elect Clinton and the president comes out and says, I know what McDonough told Wallace a long time ago, but -WALLACE: I'm sure that will be the top of his announcement.WILL: But, he'll say, let's adhere to the freshly minted McConnell rule. The McConnell rule is that nominees should be sent up by a president after the people have spoken. The people have said Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Clinton says, fine, let's draw Mr. Garland and appoint a 43-year-old, not a 63-year-old, not a moderate but a 43-year-old firebrand. Serve the Republicans right.WALLACE:  All right. A strong letter to follow. We have to take a break here, panel. See you a little later.Up next, Governor John Kasich is hanging his hopes on a contested convention. We'll ask the presidential candidate about his path to the nomination.Plus, what do you think? Would an open convention divide the Republican Party? Let me know on Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and use the #fns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  The only thing standing between a Trump versus Cruz showdown is John Kasich, who Cruz calls a spoiler.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Right now, every single vote for John Kasich is a vote for Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask Kasich what he sees as his path to the GOOP nomination, when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A look outside the beltway of Salt Lake City ahead of this week's caucuses there.Governor John Kasich won his home state of Ohio Tuesday. And even though it's his only victory so far, he said that's enough to keep him in the race for president. Earlier, I spoke with Kasich, who was campaigning in Utah.WALLACE:  Governor, let's start with your strategy to win the Republican nomination. Right now Donald Trump has 678 delegates, Ted Cruz has 423, you have 143. Even if you win every one of the remaining delegates, 100 percent, you would still be short of the 1,237 majority you need. So - so what's your path? How does the Republican convention end up turning to you?GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well - well, first of all, Chris, nobody is going to have enough delegates. We are going to go to a convention. It's going to be open. And let me also tell you that for the first time in this race, in the last two and a half or three weeks, I've received more national media attention in the last three weeks than I did in the last six months. And we're rising. Our rallies are strong. We are raising money. We're bringing more people in to our effort.And we're going to get to the convention. And I've been to a convention that was contested in 1976 as a young guy. But let me tell you, when you get to a convention, there's going to be two considerations. One, who can win in the fall? I'm the only one that can win in the fall. And then there's a second issue. And I know this is kind of a crazy one. But who actually could be president of the United States? I think that kind of matters, too.So I see the convention as nothing more than an extension of this whole political process. And I'm very comfortable with heading to that convention with momentum and more delegates and we'll let the - the people there make a choice.WALLACE:  If step one is to stop Trump, to keep him from the 1,237, some people are questioning why you're even campaigning in Utah because the fact is that if Ted Cruz were to win 50 percent of the vote, he would get all of the delegates. But you, by campaigning there, are splitting the anti-Trump vote.I want to put up what Mitt Romney said the other day. He says he'll vote for Cruz in Utah, explaining, ""a vote for Governor Kasich in future contests makes it extremely likely that Trumpism would prevail."" Your response, sir?KASICH: Well, first of all, I don't agree with him. And, secondly, people tried to get me out of the race and said that Rubio should be the pick. And if I hadn't stayed in the race and won in Ohio, Trump would have won both Florida and Ohio.But I want to make something clear to people. I'm not in this to try to stop somebody. I'm in this to tell people about my experience, my record, my vision, and my ability to bring - bring people together and to be a successful president of the United States. This is beginning to deteriorate into some sort of a political science class with a bunch of pundits trying to, you know, play a parlor game. I'm not interested in that.Chris, my entire lifetime has been to bring about change. Do you know how many people in the establishment I made angry whether I reformed the Pentagon? Do you know how many people in the establishment I made angry when I balanced the federal budget? Do you know how many people in the establishment I got upset when I brought change in Ohio?I'm a change agent. And what we're beginning to see is a lot of the establish people, one more time, trying to stop me. I am interested in improving this country and being a good president and that's precisely why I'm running. And people are beginning to understand my vision and my message because finally people are beginning to allow me to be heard.WALLACE:  Well, I want to ask you about being allowed to be heard. Fox News was scheduled to hold a debate tomorrow in Salt Lake City. Trump said, no. But we were still going to hold it with you and Ted Cruz. And then you surprised a lot of people by saying that you weren't going to participate in the debate, including Charles Krauthammer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: He complains that he's being ignored, not getting enough time, whining about it again and again. He and Carson. And then here he's being offered two hours without the interruptions of Trump, just him and Cruz. He could present his case and he turns it down.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Governor.KASICH: Well, I'm dis - I'm disappointed to hear Charles say that. He says that I was whining? Let me tell you, ""The New York Times"" had a piece the other day that showed that Donald Trump received $1.8 billion worth of national media attention. And I was like tenth, OK?Look, I'm not going to go to a debate where we don't have everybody involved in the race involved in the debate. So what am I doing? I'm using my time to campaign the most effectively way - effective way I can. I have never thought that these debates were the best way to pick a president. If somebody wants to sit down with me for an hour and interview me and ask me any question about my record, my policies, my foreign policy experience, my domestic policy experience, I'm willing to do that.But, you know, I love Charles Krauthammer. He's a good guy. And maybe sometimes people just don't understand the way that I work in politics. And, you know, see, I'm not a plotter or a schemer. I'm a guy that looks at problems and tries to solve them, which I have done all of my career, creating jobs in Washington, creating jobs in Ohio. Not me creating them, but creating an atmosphere and having the experience to run this country.WALLACE:  You have talked, as you say, about running a positive campaign. You also, at various point, have criticized Donald Trump -KASICH: Yes.WALLACE:  For creating a toxic atmosphere -KASICH: Yes.WALLACE:  When it comes to violence, for speaking in - in what you consider objectionable ways about women. What do you think of Donald Trump and the campaign he's running?KASICH: Well, you know, look, I - I heard yesterday that his family was threatened. And that disappointed me. There's no place for this kind of back and forth in violence. So from that regard, I was disappointed to hear that people were threatening that family. That's a disgrace.But I also have pointed out at times when I thought his language was inappropriate, like if I don't get nominated, there's going to be a riot. I mean what kind of talk is that? But - but I have to tell you, Chris, I've done more town halls, more interaction with voters than anybody, all the candidates added together. I take questions from the crowd. You guys follow it. And at the end of the day, I rarely, ever rarely mention anybody else's name because I spend my time giving them the answers about what I want to do -WALLACE:  But -KASICH: What my vision is. And that's the way I - I've really proceeded.WALLACE:  Well, let me ask you about a specific question in the time we have remaining. I want to explore your position on people in this country illegally. You have called them a critical part of our society. You've called them good people. They're not criminals?KASICH: Well, look, Chris, what I've said is that, you know, look, Ronald Reagan tried to fix this whole thing in 1986. And it didn't work because we didn't finish the border. I think we need to finish the border. And once it's finished, people cannot sneak in. They shouldn't sneak in now. They've got to sent - be sent home.We should have a guest worker program. And for the 11.5 million who are here illegally, if they've not committed a crime since they've been here, I would give them a path to legalization where they pay a fine, back taxes, delay in any kind of benefits they get. I think is a reasonable approach, but not a path to citizenship.My position has not changed. The idea that we're going to go into communities and yank people out of their homes and leave their kids on the porch crying, that's not what we're going to do. That's - that's just - that's more promises that will never happen and the people will become more cynical. I don't make promises, by and large, that I can't keep. I try to keep what I say. And I - I'm not deviated from this position at all.WALLACE:  But you know what Ted Cruz calls that? He calls it amnesty.KASICH: He can call it anything he wants to, I'm just telling you my position and I believe that position will be accepted by the American people and that position can pass the Congress. I lay this out in every town hall meeting. If somebody asks me, I tell them.WALLACE:  But what about -KASICH: Look, I'm here -WALLACE:  In the 30 seconds we have left, sir, what about the argument they did break the law, they came into this country illegally -KASICH: Yes, they did.WALLACE:  And - and you're letting them basically be able to stay in the country despite that.KASICH: Chris, Chris, I know that you don't believe that we can go house-to-house and block-to-block trying to track these people down to ship them out. You know that. Come on. The people know it, too. That's just silly. You know what, I'm in this race to try to fix things, not to go out and make crazy promises that are not going to happen, that are going to further aggravate the American people. So, look, you know, if people don't like that position, that's OK. I'm cool with it. But I'm not going to change my position, because I think it's reasonable and I think this whole problem is fixable. I believe it. Reagan tried. I will get - I will finish the job.WALLACE:  Governor Kasich, thank you. Always good to talk to you.KASICH: Thank you. I enjoyed it today, Chris. Thank you. It was fun.WALLACE:  It was fun.Up next, we'll bring back the panel to discuss the Republican Party's stop Trump movement. It is too little too late?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CROWD: Trump stop hate, (INAUDIBLE). Stop Trump, stop hate, (INAUDIBLE).(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Protesters outside Phoenix shut down a highway before a Donald Trump event yesterday.And we're back now with the panel.Well, there were protests yesterday not just in Arizona, but also in New York City outside the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. You can see the protest there. And all of this adding to concerns among the Republican establishment, among movement conservatives about Donald Trump actually winning the nomination.Kristen, it seems almost every day there's a new story, whether it's a bunch of fat cats have a dinner at some club here or now there's a new story about a third party and Tom Coburn, the retired senator from Oklahoma, running as a third party candidate. How seriously should we take all this talk about a stop Trump movement?KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, WASHINGTON EXAMINER COLUMNIST: The stop Trump movement may have sort of run out of time. There is so much time spent last fall attacking Donald Trump as being insufficiently conservative. And those attacks fell flat, quite frankly. Most of Donald Trumps' voters don't love him because they think he's conservative, it's because they think he's strong and he's a winner.And so the time has elapsed. Attitudes about Donald Trump have really sort of calcified. And - and if you like Donald Trump, it's unlikely at this point that you will be persuaded to change your mind. So I think at this point the math, for anybody to stop Trump before the convention, becomes very hard.He'll pick up delegates in Arizona. We'll move forward into a state like New York where the last poll showed him up by over 50 points. Donald Trump, the math looks pretty good for him for the next month and a half or. It's going to be very difficult for folks to stop him, at least from winning the Republican nomination.WALLACE:  Do you agree with that, Bob?BOB WOODWARD, ""THE WASHINGTON POST"": Yes. I mean, first of all, if - if you try to excavate this, you realize that the only way for Trump probably not to get the nomination is for him to withdraw. And that is not going to happen. If there's one thing that Trump does, he never quits. And so he's - you know, he's got the - he's the heavy in this. And there - there - there's something that he's brought forth in the populous that those of us who try to understand this don't understand. And don't -WALLACE:  I - I was going to ask you about.WOODWARD: Yes.WALLACE:  I mean you've covered a lot of campaigns, a lot of candidates. Can you put this - and I'm going to ask George the same thing, in any kind of historical perspective? Do you compare it to, you know, some people are saying Richard Nixon in '68 with a silent majority, George Wallace in '68. Do you - what do you compare Trump to?WOODWARD: I - I - it - it - you can't compare him to anything. And I - I think there are people out there who just kind of say, let's repot the plant. Let's give somebody else a chance. And it's not just anger or disappointment in their lives, it's the sense of, let's shake this up. And no one is shaking it up as much as Trump.WALLACE: George?WILL: Well, stylistically, Trump is in the George Wallace tradition. Wallace who famously said, there's too much dignity in American politics. We have to have more meanness. Wallace got 46 electoral votes because he has a regional base. What makes Trump more interesting is he's not a regional candidate. He has support all over the country, as he's demonstrated.The problem is this. Not only are his negatives 61 percent, almost doubled his positives, 32 percent, but he's appealing entirely to white people. Now, in 1988, George Herbert Walker Bush got 40 - 59 percent of the white vote, which was high. And that translated into 426 electoral votes. Mitt Romney, in 2012, got 59 percent of the white vote. That translated into 206 electoral votes. Romney got 17 percent, that's all, of the non-white vote.Trump, by every measure, would do worse than that, which means he would have to get not just the 65 percent of the white vote to win that Ronald Reagan got sweeping 49 states, he would have to get 70 percent of the white vote. A, it won't happen, and, B, it would destroy the Republican Party by making it the party of white people.WALLACE:  Now, I'm sure that the Clinton camp and the Sanders camp, they look at exactly that same demographics and basically say the country, the Democratic face - demographic face of the country is changing. On the other hand, you do hear talk, Lisa, about Trump reshuffles the electoral deck. That suddenly the rustbelt, the industrial Midwest, Pennsylvania, Michigan, states - Wisconsin, states that have gone reliably for Democrats for several election cycles, suddenly would be in play. How seriously do they take that?LISA LERER, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I mean smart Democrats, the -the ones that I'm talking to at least, are not overly confident about this. And in part that's because Trump is so wildly unpredictable. Like, yes, they agree on the demographics point. They're certainly going to try to boost support among Latino supporters, among African-American supporters, among women. But, you know, with Trump, he had a - the Republicans had obviously a lot of trouble taking him out and you just don't know what you're going to get and you don't know - he doesn't play by the standard rules.So that makes a lot of Democrats a little nervous, particularly given that Hillary Clinton, by her own admission, is not the world's best campaigner. But their theory - the case is basically three c's, credentials, character, and controversy. So they're digging through his business records. They're going to highlight deals that went badly. They're going to bring back his statements about Latinos and women and all those kinds of things and they're going to talk about his temperament. Is this someone you want with your finger on the button as a way of trying -- pulling over moderate Democrats, particularly suburban women in some of these swing states that could make the difference for them in the general election.WOODWARD:  But - but it's important that the people in the Clinton campaign, and as you - you've called smart Democrats, are worried.LERER: Right.WOODWARD: And - and that, you know, this - this is a serious worry. And, you know, just from the polling perspective, what are there almost half the people don't vote, right? And Trump is getting some of those people. The - the polls -LERER: Right.WOODWARD: There are good number on that because that's maybe why people are worried.WALLACE:  In addition to which, let's face it, if - if Trump is a target rich environment, so is Hillary Clinton.LERER: Right.WALLACE:  And Lord knows there's plenty of oppo research to be done on her.I want to ask one more thing here, Kristen. Trump is going to be in Washington tomorrow. He's going to meet with APAC, the pro-Israeli lobby. But he's also supposedly going to have a meeting with a lot of mainstream Republicans. How possible is it that he could, having taken this stance to get this far in the primaries, change his tune. I mean not change it completely, but become a much more mainstream figure and somehow make a - an accommodation with the GOP establishment?ANDERSON: I believe there are many in the GOP establishment who will want to co-opt Donald Trump, find a way to make peace with him, find a way that they can still show their face at a Republican convention that is nominating him and call themselves Republicans and sort of get through the next couple of months.But I think there's going to be a big division for the folks that consider themselves hard core conservatives who care deeply about things like limited government, who oppose someone who sounds like an authoritarian who wants to expand executive power, remain very troubled by him and might say, if he defines what it is to be a Republican, then maybe I'm not anymore.WALLACE:  George?WILL: Well, I think -WALLACE:  Can - can the party - it's a big, big tent, can it expand to include Donald Trump at least through November or is this a - stretching it too far?WILL: It cannot expand that far and remain a conservative party, which means it would be - if he's the nominee, there will be no conservative running in the race and the vishi (ph) Republicans, who are coming to terms with - as collaborators with the takeover of their party, have to understand that.WALLACE:  And do you see a third party under those circumstances?WILL: Possibly.WALLACE:  Are you going to leave (ph) the ticket?WILL: No, but I would vote for it.WALLACE:  You would vote for it?WILL: Certainly.WALLACE: All right.

9	9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/05/12/bill-oreilly-tough-times-for-social-conservatives-in-america/	Bill O'Reilly: Tough times for social conservatives in America	"In cyberspace there are scores -- scores of vicious political Web sites that try to destroy people with whom they disagree. Both sides participate but there are many more left wing smear sites than right wing.Enter the Presidential race of 2016. Republican candidates are in the smear zone especially if they speak out against liberal causes. Let me give you three examples.Here is Governor Scott Walker talking about abortion.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R), WISCONSIN: When I think of the ultrasound picture that my wife and I saw of our first son who is now going to be 21 this June. It's indistinguishable not to recognize that it's a human life. That's why I'm pro-life.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Certainly that's a reasonable position. It's a matter conscience. Yet the vicious ""Think Progress"" Web site founded by top Hillary Clinton adviser John Podesta ran a headline that said, quote, ""Scott Walker: doctors should lie to pregnant women to prevent abortions"". Now Governor Walker never said anything close to that but the Podesta crew doesn't really care. It's all about marginalizing Walker.Recently Governor Mike Huckabee said this:(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)HUCKABEE: I think it's fair to say that Christian convictions are under attack as never before, not just in our lifetime but ever before in the history of this great republic. We are moving rapidly toward the criminalization of Christianity.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Well, that's very provocative, the governor referring to merchants being forced to do things by the federal government that may run counter to their religious beliefs. In response the despicable Daily Coast called Huckabee a ""spittle-flecked idiot doing his best to promote delusional anti-gay conspiracy theories.""Finally there is Senator Marco Rubio.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't agree with the notion that some are putting out there, including scientists that somehow there are actions we can take today that would actually have an impact on what's happening in climate. Our climate is always changing.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: That same day, the ""Los Angeles Times"" ran a headline that said, quote, ""Marco Rubio says human activity isn't causing climate change"".Now, these kinds of attacks have changed politics because the Web sites know few readers will fact check the headline. The pipeline works like this. Somebody says or does something, a Web site distorts the words or actions, takes them out of context. A bigger Web site like Yahoo, for example, picks it up with a provocative headline. Then the mainstream press grabs it and, again, context and content almost always ignored. Just the accusation is played up.So it's very easy to marginalize anyone with strong opinions. And since the press is overwhelmingly left it is conservatives who get branded as kooks and extremists. Listen, they don't come any more extreme that Senator Elizabeth Warren. She's a socialist. If she gained power our whole capitalistic system would be attacked by the federal government. Yet senator Warren is in demand -- a woman of stature.But if a political candidate is pro-life, skeptical of climate change, against gay marriage, or calling for welfare reform, that person is brutally assaulted, branded a bigot, anti-woman, anti-gay, against the poor. And this image stays with them because the news and entertainment industry is simpatico, generally speaking, with the uber-liberal thought.Believe me I have experienced this for 19 years. I know how vicious the game is. But I can fight back. Others who are smeared cannot -- revolting situation that has affected our republic in a major way.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.
