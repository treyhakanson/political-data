That was what ""hope and change"" was all about. Well, according to the new CBS News poll the President has failed to do that. When asked, ""Do you think Barack Obama publicly supported same-sex marriage mostly because he thinks it's the right thing to do or mostly because of political reasons,"" a whopping 67 percent of the country said the President flipped his gay marriage position for political reasons. Just 24 percent believe he did it as a matter of conscience. That poll is devastating because it says that most Americans now think President Obama is just another politician who will change positions if he thinks it would personally benefit him. Another part of the poll asks does President Obama's support of same-sex marriage make you more or less likely to vote for him? 16 percent more likely; 26 percent less likely; 57 percent no effect. As ""Talking Points"" said last week the gay marriage deal will be a negative for the President come next November. He can say goodbye to North Carolina and has also lost some support in Florida, Ohio and Virginia, as well as some other states. So, the political calculation, if that's what it really was, and I can't read the President's mind so I don't know, has actually hurt him and maybe even damaged his image among his most loyal constituency African- Americans. On black radio stations all across the country there is outrage over the President supporting gay marriage. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) HOT 97 HOST: No question about it. I have been doing radio for a long time. And whenever I talk about this issue, I am shocked by how many people call up and are upset with the idea of supporting same-sex marriage. CALLER ANTHONY: I mean, if you have a kid, would you want your kid marrying if he's a... if he's a boy, would you want him marrying another guy? (CROSSTALK) HOT 97 HOST: If he was gay. CALLER ANTHONY: Would you want your daughter to marry another girl? HOT 97 HOST: I want my child to be happy. CALLER ANTHONY: The emotions, feelings is not the same though. HOT 97 HOST: Jennifer, you will not vote for Obama because of what he just said. CALLER JENNIFER: Definitely not. HOT 97 HOST: Why? CALLER JENNIFER: I don't know. I've never liked gay people. HOT 97 HOST: Jennifer, do you know how disgusting that sounds? CALLER JENNIFER: All right, maybe let me -- let me rephrase that I -- I'm not saying I don't like gay people. I don't really agree with what they are into. (END AUDIO CLIP) President Obama has a 50/50 chance of being re-elected. Many things can happen between now and November. Mitt Romney must perform well in the three debates. And Romney must also better define his economic vision. But right now the President is slipping everywhere. And that's ""The Memo."" ""Pinheads & Patriots."" This week the TV show ""Jeopardy!"" is featuring power players. They are not off to a fast start. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEX TREBEK, HOST, ""JEOPARDY!"": The category is ""Awards,"" and here is the clue. ""This performer is the only person to win an Emmy, the Mark Twain Prize and the Spingarn Medal. If you remembered that the Spingarn Medal is the NAACP's highest award, that would have helped you. Chris, we come to you first. CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR: Well, I got the wrong answer then. Mary Tyler Moore. TREBEK: Well, let's take a -- you're right. That will cost you. How much? Half what have you've had. You're at $2,300. MATTHEWS: Wow. TREBEK: It might work to your advantage. Let's go down to Bob Gibbs now. He had $12,800. His response was... Nobody. What did he lose? $7,200. He is at $5,600. Lizzie, it's up to you now. LIZZIE O'LEARY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I knew I didn't have it either. I went for someone I sort of love anyway. TREBEK: And you picked Tina Fey. No, the correct response is Bill Cosby. What did it cost? Lizzie, this is very important. $9,800. That drops her down to $4,200. And Robert Gibbs, congratulations. Times (ph) Hill Literacy Project will receive $50,000. (END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: All right. It's a charitable deal so you can sort out who the ""Pinheads & Patriots"" are in that crew. "

Former Russian Spy Anna Chapman Is Moving Into Politics

"	"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:Saturday Night FeverWest Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin is dealing with a party hangover from the weekend.Manchin admitted to reporters Tuesday it was a mistake to attend a family Christmas gathering Saturday instead of voting on two key Senate bills. His state's AFL-CIO president called Manchin's absence -- quote -- ""ineffective representation and leadership.""Manchin said his family celebrated the holiday early because of his grandchildren who wouldn't be there on the actual holiday. But he says if the same situation were to happen in the future, he'll be in Washington.Manchin isn't the only lawmaker missing holiday votes. More than 70 House members didn't bother showing up to vote Tuesday on bills to fund the federal government and ensure health benefits for 9/11 first responders. More than one-sixth of the lower chamber was missing, including many lawmakers who are either retiring or were defeated in November elections.Seeing RedFormer Russian spy Anna Chapman is moving into politics.The redhead took the stage to reaffirm her allegiance to Russia and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin by joining the youth wing of his United Russia Party.Chapman was deported from the U.S. last summer after an FBI sting operation exposed her and nine other so-called sleeper agents.Chapman told the crowd -- quote -- ""let's change the country, starting with ourselves -- be happy.""Acting OutAnd finally, actor Ben Affleck told NPR listeners Tuesday he is not happy with overpaid executives.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)BEN AFFLECK, ACTOR: CEOs' pay shouldn't be 200 times the average worker. It used to be nine times... OK, maybe it's legal and maybe it passes muster with shareholders. But there's something about us that fundamentally feels it isn't right.(END AUDIO CLIP)Affleck knows a little something about high salaries. He earns tens of millions of dollars for his movies and even reportedly got $250,000 just for showing up at the grand opening of a casino over the summer."
