This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to make a statement in Washington, D.C., saying we are a pro-life generation and we're standing up for the unborn. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I hope it helps everybody to realize that there we're not alone in this. There's a bunch people out there who feel the same way.PATRICK KELLY, MARCH FOR LIFE CHAIRMAN: When I look out at this enormous crowd, I see the new face of the culture of life.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: I see it in a very special way in the tens of thousands of young people who have braved frigid temperatures to come to Washington to deliver a simple but profound message -- life is beautiful.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, HOST: Impressive sight, because it was cold out on the national mall for the 41st March for Life. This is the first since the trial of Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, obviously we covered that, convicted of murdering babies born alive during botched abortions.Take a look at the latest polls, the Fox News polls taken on the issue of abortion, views on abortion, there you see pro-life, 48 percent, pro-choice, 45 percent, and how that has changed since back in October of 2012.  A new Maris poll, the most recent one out, asking the question is abortion morally acceptable or morally wrong? Morally wrong at 62 percent. That's Knights of Columbus and Maris doing that poll.We're back with the panel. Steve, thoughts?STEVEN HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: There was another finding in the Maris poll that 84 percent of Americans oppose abortion on demand until birth, which is I think a pretty significant and overwhelming number. If you take those poll numbers back further, the contrast with where we are today would be even more stark.The march today will be as it always is, under covered in the main stream media because reporters don't know many people who are pro-life, and because pro-life folks come to Washington and often brave the elements and do this year in and year out so that reporters don't pay attention in the way I think they ought to.So what we have seen over particularly the past decade is a quiet movement toward life. You've seen this in restrictions on abortion that have come up through the states, a quiet movement, a state by state movement, but a strong movement and one that's resulted in fewer abortions.  I think we're likely to see that trend continue and we're likely to see more restrictions on a state level. And obviously there is a push in Congress to enact some additional restrictions on the federal level.  There's no hope of that happening with Harry Reid running the Senate, but it's not long until that happens.BAIER: A.B., the president released a statement on this 41st anniversary of Roe versus Wade. ""Today, as we reflect on this 41st anniversary of the Supreme Court decision Roe V. Wage we recommit ourselves to the decision's guiding principle that every woman should be able to make her own choices about her body and her health because this is the country where everybody deserves the same freedom and opportunities to realize their dreams."" Politically, where do you think this falls in 2014?A.B. STODDARD, THEHILL.COM: This is so fascinating. I think while the movement was very galvanized throughout the last decade, more restrictions have been passed since the Republican wave since 2010 than had passed in the previous decade. So while they might have been building a quiet, grassroots army for results, they couldn't get them without a huge Republican wave throughout state houses and legislatures across the land, which then resulting in these, but actually happened because of ObamaCare, the bailout, the stimulus, and AIG and a bunch of other factors that were brewing in '08 and '09 and 2010.Now, as a result of these new restrictions, 22 states, 70 new laws, you're going to hear an incredible amount of fired up rhetoric by the pro-choice side in the 2014 elections. But look at the examples of Governor McAuliffefrom Virginia, ran on the issues, polls show he did well on that issue, can't do anything about it, Republican legislature. That's going to happen in Michigan, Florida, Ohio, Texas, with Wisconsin, states where you'll see the Democratic candidate talking about this issue. Even if they win, they're not going to get results.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: The tragedy is that all the arguments are always around the edges. There's no way in which a democracy like ours that you're going to have a vote on the real issue, whether to make it legal or not. And the tragedy is that people go out on the street in Cairo and Kiev because there's no other way to express yourself democratically. That shouldn't happen in a democracy. And yet for 40 years the only way to express yourself on abortion on the core issues was to go out and march in the freezing cold.And the reason is, however you feel about abortion or the morality or the legality of it, the Roe decision was an abomination because it took it out of the democratic and political realm. And to quote Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who obviously is a supporter of abortion rights, she said the Roe decision, by stopping the political process that was still moving in the reform direction, prolonged divisiveness and deferred stable settlement of the issue. That's why you have all these people today in the freezing cold and that's not how it ought to be done in a democracy, which is why Roe ought to be repealed.BAIER: Pope Francis, inserting himself again in this issue as he's been talked about a lot. He tweeted today from that account, ""I join the March for Life in Washington with my prayers. May God help us respect all life, especially the most vulnerable.""Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/09/09/did-fbi-botch-clinton-email-investigation/	Did the FBI botch the Clinton email investigation?	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" September 8, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Factor ""Follow-Up"" segment tonight. Did the FBI blow the investigation into the Hillary Clinton email situation? Last night I've told you, I have revised my opinion on Director James Comey because he released some very important information about Hillary Clinton last Friday afternoon before Labor Day when few would see it. That was a political move. And even though I gave Mr. Comey the benefit of the doubt in the email investigation itself, I can no longer do so.Today, a Wall Street Journal editorial lays out a very specific mistakes the FBI made in the investigation while Comey has released the memo to bureau employees defending himself.Joining us now from Washington, Ronald Kessler, author of the book, ""The First Family Detail"" now out in paperback. And Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI.Did you work with Mr. Comey at the FBI, way before him?RON HOSKO, FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE FBI: I worked with him for about eight months.O'REILLY: Okay. So the documents released last Friday is what really turns me not against Comey, I think he's a patriot, but now I think he's a political player and undo influences being put upon him by the Obama administration. And we all know, we in the media that if you out something out Friday before long Holliday weekend, you're trying to deemphasize it. All right? And I thought that was not what the American people are entitled to. Where am I wrong?HOSKO: Well, I think it's a fair question, Bill. But I do think you're wrong. I believe that because it was happened in this case, we have seen a sequence of extraordinary events to include the director's comments about the email scandal, without prior notice to DOJ on the substance. The recommendation not to prosecute by the director. And in effort to be transparent that has gone from that to four plus hours of testimony on the hill.O'REILLY: Yes. But why did he put the stuff out on Friday afternoon when he know nobody is seeing, why?HOSKO: Yes. Here's why I think that occurred. I believe this has been a continues since his testimony, to package up the information about this investigation, frankly the summary communication about the investigation is to me extraordinary. I've never seen it done before. Even though there are redacted parts, he is purging --O'REILLY: You don't really answer my question about -- Mr. Kessler, I want you to take crack at it. Friday afternoon after Labor Day, everybody knows they don't want people to see it why they do it.RONALD KESSLER, AUTHOR, ""THE SECRETS OF THE FBI"": This may come as a surprise. But FBI agents are human beings. And like the rest of us, we like to finish our work by the end of the week before the Holliday weekend.O'REILLY: Come on! Come on! They put it out Thursday, it's the FBI, the discipline bureau. They could have said, I needed Thursday, I needed Thursday afternoon too.KESSLER: No, that would have been manipulation to influence public opinion. He put out when I was ready.O'REILLY: How did you know that? How do you know he put it out? How did you know he didn't put it back --KESSLER: Well, because I just know, you know, human nature is such that --O'REILLY: So, you are citing human nature --KESSLER: And so they'll speed up where they'll put more effort to get something out before the weekend.O'REILLY: All right. Mr. Kessler, you know, I've read your books, pretty sophisticated guy. That answer is not sophisticated. Nobody is buying it. Everybody knows that this dump on Friday afternoon was a planned dump so people would not write about it and talk about it over the weekend. And the media was all on the beach.All right. Let's get into the Wall Street Journal today. Their big point Mr. Hosko is that Hillary Clinton was interviewed at the end of the investigation, in a very brief manner when she should have been interviewed in the beginning. And, you know, as a former FBI agent that's the way it's usually done.HOSKO: Well, I'll tell you, I personally done it both ways where you may early on has reason to get to that person and can't get to them in a state where they are unaware that your comment --O'REILLY: Well, I wasn't going to be this time. But you have to prepare what she says to what the evidence comes in if you want to establish intent. And that was not fun.HOSKO: Absolutely. Well, I hear what you're saying --O'REILLY: Thank you.HOSKO: I've seen it done the other way to, Bill --O'REILLY: All right. But it's not the right way to do it.HOSKO: No, I'll tell you here. Let's not kid ourselves. We should be no under illusion that this is going to be an aggressive hit lamp, smoky room, you know, angry raise voices interview --O'REILLY: No.HOSKO: She came in there with --O'REILLY: We expect methodical investigation, this one, I don't believe was. Mr. Kessler, I give you the last word. Go.KESSLER: Well, it wasn't methodical in the sense that of course they wants us to gather all the evidence before they confronted her. That is normally the way that it is done.O'REILLY: But they can do too.KESSLER: This kind of investigation.O'REILLY: They can get her record up top and they can compare the evidence they accumulate and then bring her back to confront her with it. You know that.KESSLER: Also, there is misinformation from Jim Kallstrom, a former agent who is well respected. Claiming that they should have recorded the --O'REILLY: Sure.KESSLER: He know that --O'REILLY: All those things should have been done.KESSLER: Unless someone is in custody. He said that --O'REILLY: This is such a high level that the American people, we're talking about a president, a possible president here.All right. Gentlemen, I want everybody to read the Wall Street Journal lead editorial. And we appreciate you guys debating. It was very interesting.

4	4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/01/15/bill-oreilly-politics-destruction/	Bill O'Reilly: The politics of destruction	"By Bill O'ReillyNo question some Democrats are trying to destroy New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. That's because they see him as a threat to Hillary Clinton in 2016 in the Presidential race.Christie's traffic scandal is pretty bad. Lots of people were adversely effected he says he didn't know about it, fair-minded people should believe him until there is evidence to the contrary.Mr. Christie's style which propelled him to political success is now hurting him. One of the reasons Mitt Romney lost to President Obama in 2012 was that Governor Romney is too much of a gentleman. He refused to take the fight to the President, for example, in a third debate on foreign policy, Romney could have knocked the President all over the place with pointed questions about Benghazi he did not do it stunning many of us who felt it was a legitimate foreign policy issue.But Romney apparently did not have the fire in the belly to deliver a knockout blow. Christie does and therefore is a threat to the power of the Democratic Party because believe me that party has lots of problems right now on lots of different fronts. And Christie who is attractive to Independent voters could exploit those difficulties. Therefore Christie must be marginalized. And a good way to do that is to use his bluster against him.Brit Hume put it this way.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Men today have learned the lesson the hard way that if you act like a kind of an old fashioned guy's guy you are in constant danger of slipping out and saying something that's going to get you in trouble and make you look like a sexist or make you look like you seem thuggish or whatever.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: So if you are passionate and state your position firmly and flamboyantly as Governor Christie does, you become a huge target especially if you make a mistake.Now, ""Talking Points"" believes the Democratic Party does not fear hard right conservatives like Senator Cruz and Senator Paul. The left believes there are not enough committed conservative voters to elect those men. Of course, they could be wrong. Both Cruz and Paul are smart guys who can raise a lot of money. And they will certainly be factors in the upcoming primaries.But again Governor Christie is at this point the biggest threat to the Democratic Party. So we are seeing a personal campaign lodged against him that will not calm down any time soon.And that's ""The Memo."""	['Clinton', 'Romney', 'Christie', 'Cruz', 'Paul', 'Obama']	[]
