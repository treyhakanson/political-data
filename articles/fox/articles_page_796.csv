"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" December 23, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SANDRA SMITH, GUEST HOST: Breaking tonight, campaign controversy after one of the most powerful media outlets in the land attacks a candidate's young children.Welcome to ""The Kelly File."" I'm Sandra Smith in for Megyn Kelly tonight. Well, it all started with a lighthearted political ads starring Ted Cruz and his family. In it, the Cruz' spoofed that some made-up Christmas classics. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NARRATOR: The whole family will enjoy reading stories like ""The Grinch Who Lost Her E-mails.""CAROLINE CRUZ, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR TED CRUZ: I know just what I'll do, she said with a snicker. I'll use my own server and no one will be the wiser.NARRATOR: And if you act now, we'll throw in the inspiring new Christmas story, soon to be an instant classic.CATHERINE CRUZ, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR TED CRUZ: Read this one, Daddy!CRUZ: OK.NARRATOR: The Senator Who Saved Christmas.SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is a good one.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: But just a few days later, a Washington Post political cartoonist accused Cruz of using his five and seven-year-old daughters as political props. And went so far as to portray the presidential candidate in a Santa outfit with an organ grinder and little Catherine and Caroline Cruz as monkeys. Outrage ensued in within hours, the image was taken out of the Washington Post website. But cartoonist Ann Telnaes is not apologizing. Taking to Twitter, arguing the little girls are fair game, because Cruz put his children in the ad, something many politicians on both sides of the aisle do. The paper's editorial page editor had a different take, saying, quote, ""It's generally been the policy of our editorial section to leave children out of it. I failed to look at this cartoon before it was published. I understand why Ann thought an exception to the policy was warranted in this case, but I do not agree.""Meanwhile, Senator Cruz hit back on Twitter and on the campaign trail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: You know, I have to admit yesterday when I saw that cartoon, not much ticks me off. But making fun of my girls that will do it. All of us learned in kindergarten, don't hit little girls. It's not complicated.  Don't make fun of a five-year-old girl and a seven-year-old girl. Listen, everyone expects the mainstream media to be liberally biased. Folks want to attack me, knock yourself out, Ted. But that's part of the process. I signed up for that, that's fine. But my girls didn't sign up for that.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: Several of his fellow candidates also agreed with him, suggesting the paper was way out of line. In the hours since, the Cruz campaign has started fund-raising off that cartoon, saying the Liberal media is desperate to destroy him and his family. As for ""The Post,"" well, it's now suggesting this was all a gift to Cruz, because, in part, it boosts his argument that the media doesn't treat him or conservatives fairly.Joining us now, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor.  And Howard Kurtz, host of, Fox News, ""MediaBuzz.""Chris, I got to start with you first. Is there anything okay about this political cartoonist using a presidential candidate's children?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, I'd sure like to see what would happen if they would have done that with the Obama girls. I don't think that would have washed. And when you wonder about double standards and you wonder about how life is different for Republican candidates than it is for democratic candidates. Here you have one of the first top tier -- one of the two first top tier Hispanic candidates running for president, ever for a major party, the guy is running and his daughters are portrayed as monkeys by the Washington Post. How would that have worked if those -- if this has been Barack Obama in 2007? I think the outrage would have been much, much louder. Because it would have been right in both cases. No matter what Ted Cruz does with his daughters in an ad, they're his doggone daughters and he can do it. And there is no space for anybody in any news outlet to use them for their purposes.SMITH: Well, Howie. We know what happens if it's the Obama daughters because it did happen in the case of the Turkey pardon. A GOP staffer criticized their appearance and their behavior at a turkey pardon, that GOP staffer was then fired. What should happen to this Washington Post editor?  You're saying she should apologize. She said he failed to look at it before it was published.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": Well, look, no editor can look at every piece of content before it's posted online. But this is an utter embarrassment to The Washington Post. And the gall of that Washington Post columnist to say, well, my news organizations just slimed Ted Cruz. But this is actually a political gift to the senator. Cruz adviser Rick Tyler telling me, ""Yes, we're raising money on this but not nearly enough to cover the damage."" And the damage of course is the human error here. This is a dad with two little girls, and they've been portrayed as animals. So, this is not some gray area of gee, maybe the paper went too far. This is an outrage, and the muted media explosion, Chris is right, had this involved Sasha and Maliyah or Chelsea Clinton, it would have been a nuclear explosion?  SMITH: Well, we do know that Ted Cruz's campaign, all right, he's raising campaigns funds on this. We actually have the fundraising e-mail that was sent out. He said, I was sickened by this. I knew I'd be facing attacks from day one of my campaign. But he said, I'd never expected anything like this. Anyway, he said, ""This is an emergency, all hands on deck. Click here to make an instant, emergency contribution and help me fight back."" So, is this a good tactic for him to turn around and use it to raise money?STIREWALT: Very often conservatives don't know who they are going to be interested in supporting until they find out who the press hates the most. And in the case of a Republican primary race, having the Washington Post, and by the way, every news outlet treats Ted Cruz as if he is some sort of troglodyte and they can't believe it. How do they like this guy?  He's so conservative. He's so polarizing, why this guy? And they keep coming after him. What they don't understand is, everything that they do, that they think is hurting Ted Cruz is hardening, is a kneeling the conservative base around him. The way it's done for Sarah Palin, the way it's done for Donald Trump, the way it's done for other figures. The conservatives say, wait a minute. If they're coming after him, this guy must be doing something right.SMITH: Well, Howie, we have a moment that perhaps we should remind the audience, the moment you shared with Megyn back in April. The media running after Hillary's Scooby van. And the attention, as we discussed the double standard. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Howie, I'm sorry, but when I see those reporters chasing after their subject who remain so elusive, who despite their best efforts, they cannot seem to pin down, the reporters there reminded me of the reporters here. Remember this? The police. They look like the police. Look at the police. The police, they're trying to capture an elusive subject, and the reporters did the same.(LAUGHTER)Not comparing the subjects to one another. Want to underscore that.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: Howie, we had to.KURTZ: Ah, you had to. Well, look, that was not the media's finest hour. I would point out that other reporting on Hillary Clinton has pointed out for example, the fiasco of her private email server. And I got to disclude Chris a little bit. I don't think every single reporter of every single news organization is biased against Ted Cruz. But New York Times recently -- now the Senator was surging in the polls, a clear number two to Donald Trump has a whole piece on how unlikable he is, and he's trying to get likeable but little kids don't like him. So when a Pulitzer Prize winning cartoonist like Ann Telnaes does this portraying the kids and animals and then sort of tone-deaf, at least could go online, or make a statement in saying, maybe I went too far, it does fuel the Senator's argument that liberal media are out to get him -- everybody in this profession would --  SMITH: Come on, Howie. We had such a fun moment. I mean --(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Oh, I'm getting too serious. Lamas. Bring back the Scooby van.SMITH: I mean, Chris, and you note this morning, you included that as one of the worst media fails of 2015. I mean, can't we just have a laugh for a minute?STIREWALT: Not the lamas. The lamas was a high point. The lamas was one of the best things that happened in 2015.(LAUGHTER)And they were able to decode it to the point of saying that the black lama was taken into custody first, and what does this mean for the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a rich nuance discussion. Twitter, for politics, however, has been worse than it has been for lamas, and not to bring it down, but unfortunately, in the airless crypt that is good sense, good reason and good judgment in politics, much of that has gone away, as reporters have joined in candidates in chasing phony outrage after outrage after outrage after outrage, and frankly, I'm tired. I'm glad the year's over. I need a break.SMITH: Chris, I mean, we have an election year coming up. So, go get some rest, buddy. I mean, Howie, the Iowa caucus, 40 days away. Do you expect anything to change in 2016 as we revved it up?KURTZ: Well, it is just amazing how much this campaign has been distracted by phony controversies manufactured outrage and a like. But to me the much bigger fundamental failure here is been the way in which the entire media establishment, let's face it, missed the rise of Donald Trump, mocked and minimized him, said he was going to implode any moment and more importantly, you know, failed to understand the anger and anxiety in the country that Trump was connecting with and the deep distrust of the political establishment and the media establishment. That's not a great laugh line, but it has not been a great year for the 40 state.SMITH: All right. Well, Chris is tired. So, we've got to let him go get some rest. Thank you guys. Great to have you with us.KURTZ: Merry Christmas.SMITH: Breaking tonight, tornadoes ripping through parts of Mississippi. Our local FOX affiliate there reporting that at least three people have been killed. Among the dead, a seven-year-old boy who was in a car. We understand that the storm has also injured several more people and has destroyed homes in the area. We are tracking these storms and will have a report a little bit later in this hour.Meanwhile, new polling suggests there could be a bit less debating at the holiday table this year as people begin to narrow down their picks for president.Dana Perino is here with her handicap of the race and her advice on keeping her cool head when it comes to heated political debates around the holidays.And new concerns over the government's ability to keep us safe, as we see new evidence that one of the San Bernardino terrorists should never have been allowed into this country.Plus, the very latest on a brutal military operation under way right now to oust ISIS from a critically important city in Iraq.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: Well, there in may be fewer talking points around the holiday table in the coming days with several new polls suggesting folks are seriously beginning to narrow down their choices for president. We are just 40 days now out from the Iowa caucuses. As a new CNN national poll shows Trump continuing to dominate his GOP competitors by a more than two to one margin. And in second place, Senator Ted Cruz outpaces the rest of the field by nearly 10 points. One of our favorite Washington Insiders is sharing her holiday handicap and some added tips on how to keep your cool as the race for 2016 starts heating up.Dana Perino is co-host of ""The Five"" here on Fox. A former White House press secretary under George W. Bush. And author of ""And The Good News Is.""DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": With a Santa hat just for Christmas.SMITH: I love it.PERINO: Thank you.SMITH: So Dana, what will the conversation be around American Christmas tables?PERINO: Well, I think that because there is so much interest as given by the ratings for all of the debates in the 2016 election that there's just no doubt as families gather, it will be, who do you like, who do you like? And this is like the first time that families have really gathered to try to lock it down. And up until now, people have sort of been window shopping, OK, for like what candidate they want. Now they're taking three to four candidates into the dressing room to figure out, do I like this dress? Do I not. And the polls are starting to lockdown.  The national polls look fabulous for Donald Trump and they have for a long time. The polls in the early states were that voting starts to really matter, are not as good for him, but still pretty good. And I think the national polls will probably have some bearing on those states. Iowa being the most important, February 1st. And then right on the heels of that will be New Hampshire, two wildly different states. Ted Cruz doing well in Iowa and some of the others sort of on their heels of the front-runners in New Hampshire.SMITH: Yes. The women, the women vote. The gender gap you say, something we're leaving out.PERINO: I feel like people are really missing this point. So thank you for giving me another chance to mention it. So, do you remember October 2012, there were Republicans all across the country, including me, who would say, yes, Mitt Romney can definitely win this election. Like who -- how could President Obama actually win re-election, and President Obama ran away with it.SMITH: Uh-hm.PERINO: One of the most important things is the women vote. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, while doing very well nationally and well with some women, they actually have a gender gap of about 27 to 19 points. So that means that they are underwater with women. Twelve percent of women in the Republican Party say they are still undecided. So, if I were Trump or Cruz and I was doing as well as they're doing, I would try to start figuring out how to deal with the gender gap. Because in a general election, remember this. One quarter of the electorate, 25 percent of the electorate in 2016, will be made up of single women.SMITH: Wow.PERINO: President Obama won women vote by 10 percentage points of 55 to 45 percent over Mitt Romney. Republicans have to do better with women, and I would say that the front-runners in the Republican primary absolutely must figure out a way to broaden their support.SMITH: So, do you think that Trump and his team are strategizing how to wrap it up?PERINO: All of his people will tell you he's doing great with women.  He loves women. I'm just telling you that the numbers are showing a different story. And if I were them and I want to close the deal, I would figure out a way to appeal to women.SMITH: All right. So, you wrote this op-ed that has getting a lot of attention in certain circles. But you wrote this op-ed, ""Resolved in 2016, I will not let politics strip me of my dignity."" You begin the piece Dana by talking about an experience that you had on an airplane that left your stomach twisted.PERINO: Yes. So, I even know for myself in 2012, during that election, I found myself, you know, I would yell at Bob Beckel or whoever it might be. And I just felt ugly about it, and it's one of those things that for me I couldn't even forgive myself for it. And it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The other night coming home on a flight, I heard this couple talking about one of the candidates and their group of supporters, and it was just so ugly, as if those people had no reason for living, that they were not even Americans. And I thought we were actually stronger as Americans because of our political system. We are stronger because of our diversity, not in spite of it. And what I wanted to do just for myself personally was to say, I am going to try so hard in 2016 to remember that the most important things in life are not politicsSMITH: We forget that sometimes, don't we?PERINO: But the most port things are faith, family and friends, and politics should not strip any of us of our dignity in 2016.SMITH: Such a great message as we enter the end of the year. And one thing I love that you wrote in this piece, being born in America was like winning the biggest lottery ever held. Americans started the finish line where we go from there is up to us.PERINO: Yes.SMITH: Such an important message as we enter into an election.PERINO: Right. And tearing each other apart doesn't seem like the best way to spend the money that we won in a lottery. We have a lot of reasons to be thankful and grateful to be Americans. In I think in the New Year, it's not going to be possible, we're going to lose our temper with each other once in a while. But just to keep in mind, we have the best country in the world. And we should try to keep it that way.SMITH: It inspired me to come up with a much better resolution than I already did. Dana --PERINO: Well, I also say that I'm probably going to need some help actually getting this done, and wine might be very helpful.  SMITH: Wine can be very helpful. Dana, thank you, and Merry Christmas.PERINO: Thanks for having me on. Happy New Year.SMITH: All right.Just ahead, as we gear up for the early state contests, we take a look at the best and worst political ads of the 2016 election season to date.  Pollster Frank Luntz is here with his analysis.Plus, we'll tell you about the big change coming to Virginia that has Republicans and second amendment supporters up in arms.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: Breaking tonight, deadly storms tearing across the southeast, with preliminary reports of 14 tornados touching down in Mississippi alone.  Our local fox affiliate is also reporting at least three people have been killed. Among them, a seven-year-old boy. Additionally, there are reports of homes being destroyed. Forecasters are warning there is the possibility of even more tornados tonight. We're tracking this dangerous situation and will bring you updates as we get them.Developing tonight, new reaction and analysis of the best and worst political ads of the 2016 election. Frank Luntz is a pollster, CEO of Luntz Global. And author of ""What Americans Really Want, Really."" Frank, good evening to you.FRANK LUNTZ, CEO, LUNTZ GLOBAL: Good evening, and I brought three ads that I think our audiences are going to like. Number one is Donald Trump.  Now let me set the tone. He's done the least advertising of any of the leading candidates, because he gets so much publicity on shows like this one. But what makes this ad interesting, it's a radio ad, is that it too has an impact. It says what Republican voters want to hear and it says so in a way that really turns them on. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to make the greatest trade deals we've ever made in our country, and I'm going to bring jobs and money back to the United States. I'll take care of our veterans and make our military so strong that nobody will mess with us. I'll secure our borders, and yes, we will have a wall. You can't have a country without borders. And I'll make sure that the Second Amendment and our religious liberty are protected. ObamaCare is a total disaster. It will be repealed and replaced with something much better.(END VIDEO CLIP)LUNTZ: Now understand that a typical radio ad only tests in the 20s or 30s, because there's no visual. But when Donald Trump articulated the things that he's going to do, step by step, one after another, the response is very positive among conservatives and moderates.SMITH: So it's very clear, Frank, that in this political cycle, and in this coming election year, what is working is the direct ads, the direct speak, people are liking that the energy that they're hearing from Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. What's not working?LUNTZ: Well, what's not working, we're going to shift the order, I'm warning the producer. What's not working is something that Jeb Bush did.  He's trying to show that as governor he was very effective, which most analysts agree with. In fact, arguably, he's one of the best governors of the last 20 years, but the problem with this ad, and it doesn't dial well, is that it shows you what he looked like back ten, 15 years ago. And the fact is, human beings age. So you're going to see a response that's not nearly as positive. Let's take a look.SMITH: I know how to do this, because I was privileged to serve in Florida for eight years. And we turned the systems upside down that weren't working. 1.3 million new jobs were created. We cut taxes every year. Income rose in people's pockets. People were lifted out of poverty.  Children started to learn. As President of the United States, I pledge to you that I will solve problems.LUNTZ: He was a great governor, and he gave the record very effectively, but the visuals don't work. And whoever designed that on his political team, I think that was the PAC. Frankly, they should be fired.  Because you can look at Bush's numbers. You show that earlier in the show, three percent, for someone who is that good a governor and only has three percent of the vote today, you know something is wrong with the presentation.SMITH: Interesting, presenting your track record, which was arguably a very good one. As far as the economy in Florida, is it working? But what is working is an ad by Ted Cruz in which he has had a trend of pulling right from his campaign rallies, right from the debate, Frank, which is arguably been very good on the campaign's pocket book. It doesn't cost as much.LUNTZ: And we're going to show you National Security ad that absolutely tested through the roof. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: If I'm elected to serve as commander-in-chief. We won't cower in the face of evil. America will lead. We'll rebuild our military. We'll kill the terrorists. And every Islamic militant will know, if you wage jihad against us, you're signing your death warrant. And under no circumstances will I ever apologize for America.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: So, a direct stance on Islamic terrorism effective.LUNTZ: More than just direct when he says we're going to kill or enemy, that's what Republicans want to hear. It's one of the reasons why Ted Cruz is now second and gaining all across the country.SMITH: All right, as a good review, many more likely to come, but it's interesting for sure Frank what's actually working. All right.LUNTZ: I do want to encourage people to watch the FOX Business debate. Because great questioners, perfect timing, January 14th. And this is exactly why the public is so engaged. Because they want to know exactly what the candidates are saying.SMITH: Charleston, South Carolina, I'll be there. Thank you.Coming up, we are getting our first look inside the immigration file of San Bernardino terrorist, Tashfeen Malik. The findings raising even more questions tonight about the visa process. And whether she could have been stopped from entering this country and committing mass murder?And as the sale of firearms surges this holiday season, the NBA is teaming up with the former mayor of New York City for a message about gun violence just in time for Christmas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN CURRY, GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS POINT GUARD: I heard about a shooting involving a three-year-old girl over the summer. My daughter Riley is that age.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was a point when I felt that I was going to die.CHRIS PAUL, LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS POINT GUARD: My parents always say a bullet doesn't have a name in it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Someone put a bullet in the back of my 14-year- old son's head.RICHARD MARTINEZ, SON KILLED BY DERANGED GUNMAN IN ISLA VISTA, CALIFORNIA: We're Americans, we don't have to live like this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can all make a difference.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: We're getting word of tornadoes hitting the South and Midwest just as people prepare for Christmas Eve. At this moment the Storm Prediction Center is reporting 14 tornadoes have touched down in Mississippi alone. While local Fox Affiliate reports at least three people there, including a 7 year old boy, have been killed. Authorities are also going door to door in the area to search for any more possible victims.  Chief Meteorologist, Rick Reichmuth is tracking it all from the Fox Weather Center.RICK REICHMUTH, CHIEF METEOROLOGIST: Such a dangerous night across parts of the central areas of the country. We've been so calm and so warm across the Eastern Seaboard. Now that warm air is giving way to severe weather as cold air moves in behind it. And we have tornado watches in effect across a big chunk of the country, from parts of Indiana and Ohio all the way down towards the Central Mid-South here. And potentially some very long-living, large, large dangerous storms that we're going to watch pull up for the East throughout the overnight hours.Now it does go into the dark overnight hours. Much more dangerous when you have these kinds of storms late at night, but this is the bull's eye where you see the red. It includes cities like Nashville and up towards Louisville and eventually later on tonight, I think even in towards the Birmingham area could be watching for some tornados moving through.  Even though that's not on the highlighted area here in the Northern parts of Alabama watch as even later tonight and across parts of the North Georgia.All of this because or partially because of these warm temperatures we have. And take a look at what happens on Christmas Eve. We're going to be breaking records, shattering records, all the way up and down the Eastern Seaboard, 66 degrees for high on Christmas Eve in Boston, 71 in New York, 73 in Atlanta, you get the idea. Even on Christmas Day will remain very warm. Storms tomorrow, by Christmas Day much of the area clearing out a little bit, if you want something colder you have to go out across the West but a dangerous night ahead with all of the tornados and record-breaking temperatures Christmas Eve. Sandra?SMITH: And developing tonight, growing outrage out of Virginia where the State's Democratic Attorney General announced that the Commonwealth will no longer recognize out of State, concealed handgun permits held by residents of 25 States. A decision made unilaterally without the state legislature. The move will impact more than 6 million legal gun owners when it goes into effect next year. Joining me now, Guy Benson, Political Editor for Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, and Nomiki Konst the Founder and Executive Director of the Accountability Project. Welcome to you both.GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: Thank you, Merry Christmas.NOMIKI KONST, FOUNDER, THE ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT: Appreciate that.SMITH: I'm sure, Merry Christmas to you. I'm sure we're going to see a spirited debates from the two of you on this one. Nomiki, I'll start out with the anger that we're seeing from the Republicans and supporters of the second amendment, Gun Rights Activist, John Whitbeck, Chairman of the Virginia Republican Party said, ""The Attorney General's announcement was further proofed that Democrats have declared war on the second amendment."" your take.KONST: Listen, you know, I'm sure in Arizona right now with my family. And my family, they're all gun owners, they're NRA members and they said to me, you know, listen they want stronger gun laws, 75 percent of NRA members believe that they should -- there should be universal background checks that there should be stronger gun laws on the books. All Virginia is trying to do right now is prevent, you know, they have very safe gun laws on the books in Virginia as do most States in America. But the States that have the weakest gun laws, you know, they shouldn't allow their citizens to come in and carry, and they don't pass the same rule that Virginia's -- the Virginia checks and go through. So they're just trying to protect their own citizen. Just like if you smoke weed, if you have a license to a medical marijuana license in Colorado, you can't walk into a state and smoke weed saying, ""Well you know, I have this medical marijuana license in my state. Why can't I smoke in this other state?""SMITH: Right.KONTS: You know, State laws matter.(CROSSTALK)SMITH: I got to get Guy in here, Nomiki. Guy and a clear sign that Americans feel that their second amendment rights is being stripped away from them and more changes may be coming. This holiday season, you know, I'm on the Fox Business Network, all day long, and we have been consistently reporting a spike in gun sales in this country. A lot of people are going to be opening up a gun underneath their Christmas tree.BENSON: Yes, not just gun sales, it's also polling on these issues. And look, I'm actually a Virginia resident. I vote in the State of Virginia, and what's fascinating is we just had an election, Sandra, in my state. And the democrats in Northern Virginia campaign on strict gun control laws to try to beef up gun control. And guess what, they lost.  They failed to regain the State senate despite this entire push that they put together. And so, now that they've lost -- now that they've had a failed attempt to convince voters, what are they doing? They're having the State Attorney General, a Democrat, impose this agenda by fiat. Now apparently, he's within his legal rights and his authority to do so, but it's just interesting, because the democrats tried to persuade Virginians, this is what ought to be done. Virginians disagreed. They're doing it anyway.SMITH: And they didn't -- and they didn't want it and they're still doing it anyway, Nomiki, and at the same time that State Attorney General is saying that this is what the State and this is what the people want.KONST: This is all about the Virginia Law. They're just saying that people come from different States and were abiding by their own laws have to follow Virginia Law. And if they -- if they pass the Virginia Law, they can have a visitor's license. You know, if we want to talk about politics here, let's talk about how the NRA spends $30 million a year lobbying the legislatures in these States, and in the states with the weakest gun laws, you have the most gun violence, and that is brought to you by gun manufacturers who are representing NRA members, who are representing the people who want safe gun laws in the books. They want to make sure that there are loopholes for felons, convicts, rapists, murderers, illegal immigrants to come and purchase guns and terrorists. So the NRA really cared about it's members, maybe they should look at their polls rather than gun manufacturers who are making money off of a tragedy.SMITH: Let's move forward. This Christmas holiday, you're going to be sitting down watching sports, many of us. And while you're watching basketball, you are likely, Guy, to see the National Basketball Association, the NBA, teaming up with Mike Bloomberg's Gun Control Group, it's called ""Everytown"", you were just seeing a glimpse of it there. This is an ad campaign to end gun violence, OK? The New York Times actually publishing today that this is unlike anything we've ever seen before.  We've seen professional athletes speak out and have a stand (ph) on this, but until now, no major sports league has lent its name and logo to such an effort.BENSON: Yes.SMITH: And we are going to see these across -- and we're going to see this across all these games this holiday.BENSON: Now look, everyone is against gun violence, right.  Especially law-abiding gun owners, everyone in America is against gun violence. So look, I have no problem with celebrities or athletes or whomever, advocating on behalf of causes they care about. I will point out that there was quite a snit fit on the left when Tim Tebow did something similar in an ad for the Super Bowl a few years ago on the pro-life issue.  But look, they are well within their rights to get out there and make their case. I'm not just sure if these types of pushes are going to actually bring about new changes in terms of gun control laws because again if you look at public opinion, it is shifting away from gun control in a and b, the NBA has a bit of a gun violence culture to deal with itself. So this might be a bit of a position heal by itself situation.SMITH: Nomiki, you're shaking your head, the ads are going to feature, we're told, star NBA athletes, calling for an end to gun violence.  The first 30-second ad is set to run as five times on Friday, Christmas Day alone. This is going to be a huge focus that they're putting out there on shooting victims. Your take.KONST: Yeah and a lot of these NBA players come from communities where there's gun violence and have been -- have had family members as victims. So I think those message are very powerful, especially to Americans who do want sensible gun laws. And, you know, to go back to Guy's point here, that's absolutely untrue that the polls are saying that gun owners want sensible laws. They don't want felons to have access to these guns. They don't want these open loopholes. They don't want the lax gun laws that they have in States where there's more gun violence. So I think, you know, kudos to Everytown, you know, they're only spending $300,000 a year on messaging and lobbying compared to the $30 million a year spent by the gun manufacturers and lobbying Congress. And that's where -- that's why we're not having any action.You know, nothing's changing because law makers are being bought and sold. Every time there's a tragedy, you have the NRA not ask, you know, just going out there putting ads out to buy guns and.SMITH: All right.KONST: .they're going -- they're something into the legislators -- their legislators office to get user (ph) gun laws and that's the problems.  They're not representing their member.BENSON: You're ignoring the constitution and the will of the people.KONST: They're not.SMITH: Legal gun owners fear that their rights are going to be stripped away. If the only (ph) legal gun owners that we are concerned about and the concern is that new laws won't take.BENSON: They don't follow the law.SMITH: That's the point. All right, guys, thank you very much for both joining us tonight.BENSON: Thank you.KONST: Thank you so much (INAUDIBLE). Merry Christmas.SMITH: All right, breaking tonight, we are getting our first look at new evidence that may prove one of the San Bernardino terrorist involved in the worst terrorist attack in this country since 9/11 should never had been allowed here in the first place. Plus the very latest on a brutal military operation underway right now to oust ISIS from a critically important city in Iraq.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: Breaking tonight, new details on day two of a bloody military operation to oust ISIS from a critically important city in Iraq. More than 10,000 Iraqi security troops have poured into Ramadi, a key strategic and symbolic city, just 60 miles from Baghdad.ISIS overran Ramadi in May. It was an embarrassing defeat for Iraq and the U.S. Today, U.S. and coalition aircraft dropped more than 50 bombs on ISIS targets, and right now, hundreds of Iraqi troops are closing in on a fortified ISIS compound in the heart of the city.U.S. intelligence estimates that up to 350 Jihadists are dug in and willing to fight to the death. Iraqi forces say it may take another two or three days to clear the city.Also, breaking tonight, we're getting our first look at new evidence that may prove one of the San Bernardino terrorists should never have been allowed into the country. This is the entry visa, and passport, of Tashfeen Malik.She the Pakistani immigrant who along with her husband killed 14 innocent people at a Christmas Party. Malik was given a visa reserved for the fianc,s of U.S. citizens. She is required to prove that the couple had met and intended to marry. But we're learning that may never have actually happened.Pete Hegseth is a Fox News contributor, Iraq and Afghan War Veteran and CEO of Concern Veterans for America. And Robert Zimmerman is a democratic strategist and co-founder of Zimmerman/Edelson on public relations.All right, Pete, I want to start with you first.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good evening.SMITH: Did this visa application process, did it fail us? Did this fail us or the country?PETER HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It clearly failed. I mean, there was a set of information our government asked for. They provided a portion of it. They couldn't -- they never actually proved that they met in person. And then suddenly, somehow, it was approved anyway.So you've got, clearly, a giant bureaucracy looking to almost box check, as we know with so many of these bureaucracy that's what happens.  There's such an overwhelming volume, they don't know how to handle it, so they just shuffle it through as a de facto decision without really analyzing what was in the file, without really knowing whether they met and any sort of validation of whether it's factual and so you get what we got.  And you wonder why people are so frustrated with our immigration system it's because it's a box-checking exercise, not actually validated at the ground level.SMITH: Robert, they -- in the chairman's release, he said they demonstrates that visa screening process was incomplete by the state department's own standards, by the findings that were released here. It is tough to disagree with anything and the fact that lives could have been saved if this process had been efficient.ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, let's be clear. While the investigation is ongoing, it is well-established that the visa application process has got to be tightened.President Obama's called for that and we're seeing a very strong bipartisan leadership in the house where 417 -- 19 voted to tighten our visa application process, and Senator Chuck Schumer is leading 22 democrats to do the same.This is -- as Pete pointed out, a bureaucracy that is plagued our government for over a decade now and in fact we're seeing progress made on this but let's not jump to conclusions until the investigation is over as to whether lives could be saved.My concern likewise here though, is that if when we look at this visa application situation, as frustrating is and the tragedy complication present it is -- should concern all of us to see the republican presidential candidates use this as a political tool to attack refugees and spread more hate and fear.And that's what should concern us enormously, because the refugee children and the refugees coming in from Syria are also the victims of terrorists and the United States should be very focused on.HEGSETH: Shouldn't it matter where they're coming from Robert?  Shouldn't it matter where they're coming from? Isn't there basic litmus test here, a filter we can apply initially in light of the fact that we're at war?ZIMMERMAN: Well, and when it comes to refugees, there is a filter that's put in place and in fact, we have an extraordinary system where we've taken in since 2011.HEGSETH: Extraordinary.ZIMMERMAN: Yeah, it's indeed we have.SMITH: Robert, you say an extraordinary system, but the American people don't feel that way.ZIMMERMAN: Well, you know something? With all the fear and hate mongering, I would see that. And.HEGSETH: I'm not hate mongering. I'm after the facts.ZIMMERMAN: Let know the facts are that we have taken in over 785,000 refugees since 9/11. Only 12 have had to be returned. We've taken a 27,000 Syrians and in fact, none of them have had to be returned.SMITH: And Robert and the American people are questioning that, and many of them showing that they do not support accepting more refugees into the United States. 43 percent support, 51 percent, a majority oppose.  That's from the latest Quinnipiac Poll.ZIMMERMAN: But, you know something Megan, but, excuse me, Megan, you know something Sandra let's also remember at World War II in 1939, 60 percent of the American people according to Gallup poll.SMITH: Sorry (ph).ZIMMERMAN: .would didn't want to allow Jewish refugees to come in either.SMITH: All right, we've got to go guys. Thank you for joining us tonight.ZIMMERMAN: Merry Christmas.SMITH: Merry Christmas to you both as well.ZIMMERMAN: Also Sandra. OK.SMITH: Pete's got a new little boy at home. Go enjoy him.Up next, He analyzed 1,000 near death experiences. Pastor John Burke tells us what the five most common things people say they have seen in heaven.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: My next guest, he is the promise of the afterlife in Christmas. Pastor John Burke examined about 1000 stories of Near-Death Experiences. Joining me now Pastor John Burke of the Gateway Church in Austin, Texas. He is the author of the book ""Imagine Heaven"". Welcome to tonight.JOHN BURKE, FOUNDER, GATEWAY CHURCH IN AUSTIN: Well, thank you, thanks for having me on.SMITH: So what is it that you're -- and you analyzed 1000 near-death experiences? What did you find?BURKE: Well, it's fascinating because, you know, the hope that it's Christmas that we look for in Christmas. I believe really God's greatest gift that he gave at Christmas was the hope of heaven.And what I found is really hard-hitting evidence that this hope is real, that it's not just a pipe dream. That there's -- there is something coming after this where finally there are really will be peace and the joy that, you know, that we hear promised but gosh, we look around the world and there isn't much. And.SMITH: So from talking to these people, what do they say that heaven looks like?BRUKE: Well, so what I do is I put together the commonalities and show how it really reveals the heaven in the bible but they talk about it in very pragmatic terms. Like they talk about how alive they feel. Not just with five senses but with more like with 50 senses.And they say when they come back to this earth, it feels like that's the real life and this one is more like a shadow. They experience beauty, flowers, and trees, and mountains, and grass, but really like of another dimension with colors of them.SMITH: Well John, your story is such an important one and I'm sorry, I just want to get your story in here because you weren't always a believer. You didn't always believe in God, you weren't always Christian.  That happened .BURKE: Yeah, I was skeptical.SMITH: .at a moment in your life and then you've taken these all on.  And you have amazing words for those that do suffer grief during the holiday season because it is difficult for a lot of people who miss loved ones that have passed. Your advice to them?BURKE: Yeah, I mean, I was an engineer, I was skeptical of all this and what I saw through this is really hard-hitting evidence that life continues on. In fact, another commonality is this great reunion that people experience.My mom passed away this year, and you know when you're missing loved ones in the holidays, the real hope is that we're going to be united again, that there is hope for that. And that's God's promise of Christmas, hope for life eternally for all who want it.SMITH: Right, Pastor John Burke, thank you for joining us tonight and Merry Christmas to you.BURKE: Merry Christmas. Thanks for having me on.SMITH: We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: Tune in tomorrow night for Fox's"" West Point Holiday Special"" hosted by Gretchen Carlson at 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time.Thank you for watching. I'm Sandra Smith. Merry Christmas, everyone.  This is ""The Kelly File.""Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And this is a Fox News Alert. A horrific attack in southern France, at least 77 are dead, 50 injured after a truck driving at full speed plowed into a very large crowd in the city of Nice.Welcome to ""Hannity."" We are in Cleveland, Ohio, tonight ahead of the Republican national convention. Authorities now say the massacre was deliberate, and France's president is, in fact, calling it a terrorist attack.Joining us now tonight with the latest details is our own Benjamin Hall -- Benjamin.BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Sean, yes, that all too familiar news of another terror attack striking at the very heart of Europe. As you say, the death toll continues to rise. It does stand at 77 now, but there are 15 at least critically wounded and fears that that number might jump up towards 100.This was during the celebration of French independence, Bastille Day, celebrating liberty, fraternity, equality on one of the most famous roads in the world. It was full of tourists. It was the definition of a soft target.Soon after around 11:00 PM local, a truck pulled up slowly towards the end of the crowd. It had been closed to vehicles, that road, but suddenly, this truck accelerated and plowed into the people lining the beach, watching the fireworks. The truck zig-zagged through the people for over a mile before it was finally stopped.There are also reports that the attacker had been firing through the window. Guns and grenades were found in the truck later, along with papers belonging to a French Tunisian man.Footage of the scene shows a bloodbath, bodies littering the road, mangled and bloody. Families are trying to find family members that they had lost.  Children's dolls have been seen lying next to the bodies. It is carnage.ISIS-friendly Twitter accounts have been celebrating the attack, but there is no claim of responsibility yet, and still no word on the identity of the driver, of the attacker, though with the discovery of these papers belonging to the French Tunisian man, it is appearing that all too familiar connection to radical Islam may be true.Now, the French president, Francois Hollande, has been speaking just in the last few moments, and he has said he's going to extend the heightened security level. Just before the attack, he had said he was going to reduce it. It's been at its highest level since the November attacks, and he had felt that after the European soccer tournament that maybe things are improving.Well, that is not true. The threat level is as high as ever. He is talking about increasing security at the borders, mobilizing more police, and he has told hospitals in the area to get ready for victims.So a tragic day, and we'll bring you more information, Sean, as we hear it.HANNITY: All right, Benjamin, thank you. It is evil for sure in our time, very scary times.Joining us now from our Washington bureau is our Fox News chief intelligence correspondent, our own Catherine Herridge. Catherine, the latest from you.CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Sean. As Benjamin just said, a short time ago, the French president confirming 77 dead, many of them children, calling it an attack that strikes at the heart of the French identity coming on Bastille Day, the French president calling the perpetrators simply ""fanatics.""Meantime, a former senior intelligence official is drawing our attention tonight to al Qaeda and this fall 2010 edition of its propaganda magazine, Inspire, where it calls on followers to use trucks as killing machines to mow down civilians. Al Qaeda and ISIS share the same techniques, but al Qaeda has been the one to first champion these styles of plots.A U.S. government official tells Fox News that the Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, is receiving regular briefings on the attack. The official said, given the indicators -- a soft target in a major economic tourist hub on the French national holiday -- they all point to terrorism, and ISIS has become more brazen in its targets and its plots.The officials said they are, quote, ""starting with terrorism and then working back."" The officials said the threat stream for trucks used as killing machines or laden with explosives was not in today's intelligence briefs, nor in recent days, and described the attack in Nice as a surprise, that they had been in effect blindsided.Tonight, two sources, including one that tracks jihadist social media, report that ISIS accounts are, quote, ""celebratory"" and telling followers to use the Nice hashtags. This is not a claim of responsibility, and these are not leadership accounts, but it gives you a flavor of the attack's immediate impact.Tonight, the White House issuing a statement condemning the attack in the strongest possible terms, saying that it is horrific and the U.S. government is offering assistance to investigate. In previous attacks, that has included signals intelligence from the NSA that is used to identify and track terrorists, as it did those responsible for the Paris massacre last November, Sean.HANNITY: All right, Catherine Herridge, thank you so much. We appreciate it.HERRIDGE: You're welcome.HANNITY: And joining us now is the author of ""Defeating Jihad"" and the distinguished chair of military theory at the Marine Corps University, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.Dr. Gorka, radical Islamists have been telegraphing this very specific attack now for a very, very long time! Is the West ever going to wake up in terms of what it is that the caliphate means? In other words, there is a purposeful caliphate by radical Islamists that they want Islam and Islamic law to rule the entire world. Do you think most people understand that yet?SEBASTIAN GORKA, ""DEFEATING JIHAD"" AUTHOR: I think you do, Sean. I think Fox viewers understand it. The military that I have the honor of working with and the FBI agents that I work with, they get it. They get it.That's not the problem. The problem are the decision makers, the people sitting in the White House, the National Security Council, Jeh Johnson, the attorney general. I mean, what is the president going to do tomorrow? Is he going to ban trucks in America? Because that's what he said after Orlando and San Bernardino. We have to ban semi-automatic rifles.I mean, this is the absurd situation. We have a political elite in a fantasy land, and we have you, your viewers, your family, my family living in the world of the caliphate expanding and taking its war to America and to our allies, Sean.HANNITY: You know, I want to read something to you, Dr. Gorka, as we look at these horrific, evil images -- 77 dead, 50 people injured, more carnage, another terror attack. It seems the world does not want to wake up. The president did say a terror attack. He did not say it looks like an Islamic terrorist attack. We'll get to that later tonight.But we have intelligence officials in this country -- they drew attention to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and in the fall of 2010, they have an on-line edition of their propaganda magazine. I know you know it well.  It's called Inspire. And it called on their followers to use trucks as killing machines to mow down civilians.And by the way, al Qaeda and ISIS share the same techniques. The magazine reads, quote, ""The idea is to use a pickup truck as a mowing machine, not to mow grass, but to mow down the enemies of Allah. To achieve maximum carnage, you need to pick up as much speed as you can"" -- which, by the way, happened in this case -- ""while still retaining good control of your vehicle. The ideal location is a place where there are maximum numbers of pedestrians and at least a number of vehicles -- in fact, if you can get through to a pedestrian only location that exists in some downtown areas.""Now, that spelled out -- that was spelled out in 2010, Dr. Gorka! And it seems like the West -- and I will include America in this -- is not taking this level of threat seriously, which is why we have incident after incident.GORKA: Sean, this is exactly why I wrote ""Defeating Jihad."" I want to send a very clear message to all Americans. You are on the front line of this war. It's not just the people who wear the cloth of the republic or who carry a badge or a gun.It's the soccer moms at the soccer game. It's the people picking up their groceries at the grocery store. It's those American kids in a concert, an American concert in downtown Paris or at a Christmas party in San Bernardino.There is no front line on this war. The front line is when you leave your house in the morning. That's the front line. And this is the reality.  The enemy has a plan. The enemy is dedicated.And I know one thing, Sean, and you know this as well as I do. If the political correctness continues, we will see attacks like this in America.  They will continue to bring the jihad to our shores. We have now -- it's gone up since we last spoke. We have now killed or arrested 107 ISIS individuals on U.S. soil since the caliphate was declared. Not 7, 107.HANNITY: Dr. Gorka, many of the topics we've been discussing this presidential election season -- immigration, Donald Trump talking about at least a temporary ban on people coming from countries that practice sharia law -- we have -- we've watched the Islama-ization (sic) of Europe, and I've discussed it at length on this program and on my radio program.You know, for example, most people don't know that Great Britain has 88 sharia courts or that no-go zones actually do exist in France. I know because I've covered it here on this program.But if somebody grows up in a country that believes that men can tell women how to dress, whether they can go to school, whether they can go to work, if they tell women that they can't drive, if a woman needs four male eyewitnesses for rape, and you want to come to America, how do we know that you don't want to advance your theocracy, your caliphate, or whether or not you want to assimilate?How can you possibly ascertain what is in the heart of that individual? It goes to the heart, the very heart, of this election campaign!GORKA: Exactly, Sean. Without a doubt, this election, November, will not be about pocketbooks. It won't be about ObamaCare or tax rates. It's going to be about innocent people being mowed down as they have been in America and in Europe. It's going to be a national security election.And what are the American people going to want more and more? Just look at Donald Trump's figures in the last 10 days. His figures are increasing because he says, I'm going to be a law and order candidate and I'm going to fight a war. He is explicit. This is a war.This isn't violent extremism, as the Obama administration would have you believe. It's not about jobs for jihadis. It's about crushing a global conspiracy that wants to enslave or murder us, Sean! And people are ready.  You know, after seven years, they're ready for leadership.HANNITY: You know, I love the fact that you point this out. This is a winnable war. We are talking about the free world and the United States of America and the greatest military on the face of this earth.But it really does highlight, you know -- when the president would use the euphemisms -- man-caused disasters, overseas contingency operations, workplace violence -- even today, he said -- yes, he did say ""terror."" I guess that's a step in the right direction. But he won't recognize Islamic terrorism, which is what this likely is.And then we get to the issue of $150 billion to Iran. And then we get to the issue of pulling out of Iraq early and creating a vacuum in Iraq and Syria for ISIS. And then we get into the issue of the president giving Mohamed Morsi, a former Muslim Brotherhood terrorist, you know, F-16s and $1.5 billion in tanks.And it really does highlight in retrospect how dangerous these decisions were, does it not?GORKA: Oh, completely. I mean, thank you for honing in on the subtitle of my book. Everybody gives me grief that I say it's a winnable war. But it is winnable if we have American leadership.But to win a war, you need two requirements, Sean. Number one, you have to admit you're at war, which this administration doesn't. And secondly, you have to want to win. And again, if you look at the decisions in Iraq, the decisions in Libya, in Syria, with Iran, it is not about winning.The president has said -- the president has said that global warming is the primary threat to America. Well, I'd like somebody at a press conference tomorrow to ask him if he still thinks it's global warming that endangers the American citizen.HANNITY: Wow. You know, you bring that up. You bring up jobs for jihadis. I mean, frankly, I don't have strong enough words to say just how asinine a lot of these policies are and these euphemisms are and these, you know, cliched statements of him.The French mayor has spoken out. Now, we watched the unfolding of the refugee crisis all across Europe. We're debating how many people to take into this country. Donald Trump has pointed out that Hillary wants a 550 percent increase in the number of refugees that we're taking in. Each refugee, by the way, would cost the American taxpayer $20,000.But now the French mayor says no more Muslims. He orders the destruction of certain places where there's over 7,000 Muslims in that particular area.  We saw what happened in Germany. We saw what happened in Belgium.Do you think Europe now revisits the idea of their immigration policies?GORKA: Well, look, if common sense had any role to play, you'd think it would. I think the Brexit is an indication of the average person saying enough is enough.I mean, you know, just a couple of data points, Sean. Somebody who tracks these things in the government sent me a map of Nice this evening. Within walking distance of the promenade where the attack occurred is a (INAUDIBLE) sensitiv (ph), what others have called an enclave. Within walking distance of the attack is an area that does not have full sovereign control by the federal authorities.Secondly, this should make everybody wake up. I've been told by a very reliable source that of 2,000 refugees we've let into the country recently from the war zones in the Middle East, once they are given refugee status and handed over to the charities that house them and give them addresses, the federal authorities are not allowed to know the address of where they're living because that impinges upon their privacy rights. Think about that, Sean.HANNITY: Yes.GORKA: It's insanity. It's insanity!HANNITY: It is. I want to lean on your position as the distinguished chair of military theory at Marine Corps University, Dr. Gorka, and I want to ask you this.I look at Vietnam. I look at 58,000 Americans died in that conflict, in that war. I look at Iraq and I look at Afghanistan, and I see that 5,000 American, you know, men and women, American treasure, blood, sweat, financial cost and tears -- and I see in each conflict in war, maybe they start out with all the best intentions. These wars then get politicized in D.C. We end up pulling out early, and the very gains that these Americans sacrificed for are then handed over to the enemy.I don't think we can fight wars this way anymore. We can't have kids go to Iraq or go to Afghanistan, and they don't even have up-armored Humvees and knocking door to door, you know, trying to find a single terrorist in one place.You talk about winning this war. How do we win this war without the political -- without politics getting in the way and stopping victory?GORKA: We can't. If we allow politics into the threat assessment or national security, we will continue to lose. The political elite -- look, I completely dismiss this conventional wisdom of what is called the CNN effect, that if sooner or later we see too much bloodshed, too many of our Marines or soldiers injured, and then the American public says, enough.  Bring them home.It's not true, Sean. The American public will support any war that is just if the leadership in Washington explains to them the stakes involved. Look at World War II. We mobilized 12 million Americans to destroy the Nazis!We need the leadership in D.C. to say, Look, if we don't win this war, your children may be targeted. That's what it takes.HANNITY: Yes. Dr. Gorka, I always appreciate having you on. I wish -- again, we see evil in our time. America defeated fascism and Nazism and imperial Japan, and America can defeat this evil enemy in our time. But we better have the will and the desire and the knowledge the and understanding of what it is we're facing, or we will not win. Dr. Gorka, thank you.We'll continue. We'll monitor breaking news out of Nice and France and the latest on this very evil terror attack. We'll check in next with former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich as we continue from Cleveland, Ohio, ahead of the RNC convention.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And this is a Fox News Alert. A massacre in France. At least 77 are dead, including children. and 50 are wounded after a truck mowed down people during a celebration in France earlier today. France's president is calling this a terrorist attack.Here with reaction tonight is former speaker of the House. Newt Gingrich is with us. Mr. Speaker, I don't want to really tie this into politics, but every issue America is now dealing with, every issue that we have discussed in recent months and years about the Islama-ization of Europe, about refugees, about immigration, about open borders -- it seems to come together, and also political correctness and not recognizing radical Islamic terrorism as the enemy and evil in our time.From your perspective, what does this tragedy, this evil attack tonight, mean for that conflict and debate?NEWT GINGRICH (R), FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER: Well, first of all, Sean, as you know, I was in Paris just last weekend talking with people who are deeply involved in trying to deal with the Iranian government and other sources of terrorism.And let me also say Daniel Silva has a remarkable new novel called ""Black Widow."" And the entire opening section is on the systematic Islamic attack on Jews in France, which is the worst it's been since the Nazis.So let me start with where I'm coming from, and let me be as blunt and as direct as I can be. Western civilization is in a war. We should frankly test every person here who is of a Muslim background, and if they believe in sharia, they should be deported. Sharia is incompatible with Western civilization. Modern Muslims who have given up sharia, glad to have them as citizens. Perfectly happy to have them next door.But we need to be fairly relentless about defining who our enemies are.  Anybody who goes on a Web site favoring ISIS or al Qaeda or other terrorist groups, that should be a felony, and they should go to jail. Any organization which hosts such a Web site should be engaged (ph) in a felony. It should be closed down immediately.Our forces should be used to systematically destroy every internet-based source. And frankly if we can't destroy them through the internet, we should destroy them with kinetic power, using various weapons starting with Predators and just -- frankly, just killing them.I am sick and tired of being told that the wealthiest, most powerful civilization in history, all of Western civilization, is helpless in the face of a group of medieval barbarians, who, for example, recently burned 20 young women to death -- burned them to death because they wouldn't have sex with them, a group which beheaded recently in the Philippines two Canadian businessmen.And we're told to be reasonable, to be passive, to not judge. Well, I just want to tell you tonight everybody who watches this video, this is the fault of Western elites who lack the guts to do what is right, to do what is necessary, and to tell us the truth, and that starts with Barack Obama!HANNITY: That's a powerful statement. I agree wholeheartedly. Let me go back to the beginning of your statement. You said Western civilization is at war, and you said sharia is incompatible with Western civilization.  Here's my question because it goes to the heart of the refugee debate, statements made by Donald Trump that until we're able to vet people coming from countries that practice sharia, they shouldn't be allowed into the country. So it's a big part of our national security debate heading into the election.So my question is if you have a clash of cultures and people believe they can tell women how to dress, whether they can work or drive or go to school, and they treat women like second-class citizens, and you can't build a temple, and you can't build a Christian church, and so they're against women and gays get murdered for being gay -- so there's attacks against women, gays, Jews and Christians.How do we ascertain -- how do you possibly ascertain whether or not that person really wants assimilation, really wants a new life, or whether or not they want to expand that caliphate, which is what we're at war against?GINGRICH: Look, the first step is you have to ask them the questions. The second step is you have to monitor what they're doing on the internet. The third step is -- let me be very clear. You have to monitor the mosques. I mean, if you're not prepared to monitor the mosques, this whole thing is a joke.Where do you think the primary source of recruitment is? Where do you think the primary course of indoctrination is? You've got to look at the madrassas. If you're a school which is teaching sharia, you want to expel it from the country.We have to understand this is -- we are behaving as though we are insane.  We're like sheep wondering why the wolves keep killing us. These people are opposed to our way of life. They are opposed to our value system.  They are opposed to our various religions. They're opposed to the whole concept of freedom, and they're very honest about it. They tell us what they want to do.And again, I just want to cite because it's so remarkable -- I mean, Daniel Silva's new book, ""Black Widow,"" which is a novel -- the opening couple of chapters are so scary in being exactly what you just saw tonight in Nice, that I can't recommend it too highly.HANNITY: You know, there's a propaganda magazine by al Qaeda, and in 2010, our intelligence officials drew from it. It called on followers to use trucks as killing machines and mow down civilians. And al Qaeda and ISIS share the exact same techniques.You know, a very prominent national security figure once pulled me aside recently and said to me, Europe is gone, and he was explaining -- 88 sharia courts in Great Britain. He said no-go zones are real, separate and apart -- not a part of assimilating with European society, and that Europe is going to be subject to attack after attack after attack, and America is probably 10, 15, to 20 years behind in making the exact same mistakes.Is he right in that assertion?GINGRICH: Well, the director of French intelligence said yesterday, ironically, that Europe's on the edge of a civil war. And I think that's probably true. You look at the number of rapes and assaults in Germany last year, which only now is coming out, over 1,200 women raped and assaulted in Germany by people who are here from places like Syria.You begin to realize that the whole elite media, the whole elite political class has been desperately trying to keep the lid on the truth of where we are and what our situation is.Again, let's take a couple simple examples. The sharia courts in Britain should be outlawed. Why should you tolerate a religiously imposed court and is opposed to the civil society all of us agreed to be part of? That's a total repudiation of everything that goes back to the Magna Carta and the whole concept of English common law.Similarly, here in the United States, why should we tolerate a single person coming here who doesn't want to become an American -- when they say, Well, the guy in Orlando, for example, who killed people at the gay nightclub, he's an American citizen. Fine. His father was committed to a radical version in Afghanistan. He said he was delighted at 9/11. I mean, the minute somebody says, I'm delighted at 9/11, that Americans were killed, I think we should put them under deep surveillance. That's strike one.And I'd be like in a two-strike, not a three-strike model, and I think you either kick them out of the country -- and people tell me they can't do that to American citizens. We are in a war. We had better rethink the rules, or we are going to lose the war.HANNITY: Mr. Speaker, let me ask you this. In light of all of these recent attacks, in light of Belgium and San Bernardino and Orlando and Paris not once, not twice, but now three times in this most recent attacks -- you think back to the beginning of the Obama administration -- overseas contingency operations, man-caused disasters, workplace violence, all of these ridiculous phrases -- and then a policy that gives $150 billion to the number-one state sponsor of terror, which is Iran. They pull out of Iraq and create a vacuum, an opening for ISIS to have financial support through the oil there. They never follow through in Syria.You look at the series of decisions that the reluctance and resistance, as mysterious as it is, to even say radical Islamic terrorism -- and is this now the predictable result? Have we gone back to a pre-9/11 mindset?GINGRICH: Well, let me say two things. First of all, everyone watching us should read General Mike Flynn's book, ""Field of Fire,"" because he really outlines exactly the problem with the Obama administration, but also candidly, the problem with the Bush administration.I encountered as early as 2002 and 2003 -- the State Department was saying, Oh, please don't talk about radical Islamists. Please don't talk about Islamic supremacists. So the State Department, which is probably one of the two worst departments in the United States, the other being the Veterans Administration -- the State Department is totally helpless. And even under the Bush administration, they followed a policy where they didn't tell the truth.Remember, it's President Bush who says that Islam is a religion of peace, which is baloney. It's not that Islamists are necessarily evil...HANNITY: Mr. Speaker...GINGRICH: ... but they're not necessarily a religion of peace.HANNITY: All right, we're going to have more with former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, talk a little bit of politics, not much, with him when we come back.Also, we have more breaking news out of France. We'll check in with Donald Trump, Jr. We'll find out the campaign (sic). They have delayed the announcement of Donald Trump's vice presidential selection. We'll find out from Donald Trump, Jr., about that and much more straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And this is a Fox News alert. A horrific attack in southern France. The country's president is in fact calling this a terrorist attack. At least 80 now are dead, 50 are wounded after a truck plowed through a crowd during, of course, a celebration in France.Now joining us, we continue with Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump, we believe you were down to the final two candidates. He was expected to announce tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m. who his selection was for vice president. There was widespread speculation. ""The L.A. Times,"" ""Daily News,"" CNBC, ""The Tribune,"" ""The Guardian,"" ""The New York Times,"" ""Indianapolis Star,"" that in fact it was Mike Pence. I'm not sure. You don't have to answer this if you don't want. Have you heard from the campaign?GINGRICH: I haven't talked to the campaign all day today. But let me say one more thing about Nice, if you don't mind. I fully expect by tomorrow morning that President Obama will have rediscovered his leftwing roots and will give a press conference in which he'll explain that the problem is too many trucks.HANNITY: Trucks?GINGRICH: If only we had truck regulation, then we wouldn't have problems like Nice because it is trucks that are dangerous. I mean that's the exact analog to Orlando and just tells you how nuts the leftwing in America is.I have been talking with the campaign all day today. I think that probably Donald Trump did the right thing in postponing everything until tomorrow because this is such a horrendous event in France that we ought to focus on the historic nature of this. I hope he will give a very significant statement tomorrow on what's happened in France and lay out the kind of changes we need. I think that's the right thing to do.And I'm sure at some point either tomorrow or Monday he will announce the vice presidential candidate. And at least at the moment, it certainly looks like it's going to be my good friend, Governor Mike Pence. We're very close colleagues. Mike and I go back many, many years, and I'm looking forward to -- you know, if I'm not the vice presidential nominee, I'm going to go all out for the ticket.HANNITY: So you have not officially been told is how I'm interpreting that.GINGRICH: I've not officially been told.HANNITY: Let me ask you this. I actually heard Mike Pence once describe himself as a Reagan, Kemp, and Gingrich Republican. Your reaction?GINGRICH: That's part of why I love the guy. I mean, look, I called him today and we chatted for a while about how we're going to help each other whatever comes out of this because we're both committed to victory over Hillary Clinton. We're both committed to helping Donald Trump be successful. And he pointed out to me back when he was running for the state legislature, way back in 1988, he had a whole bunch of go PAC training tapes I had done sitting on the floor of his car. He put them in his -- back then they were cassettes.HANNITY: I listen to those too just for historical purposes. Between that and the renewing American civilization tapes, I've looked at all of those.GINGRICH: Well, so it's pretty hard to not feel very close to a guy who can tell you that something like, you know, 28 years ago he was already in there trying to learn and study. We certainly have had a great relationship. He's been a very good governor of Indiana. I think he'd be very comfortable supporting me. I'm comfortable supporting him.HANNITY: Look, I've been very vocal because I've known you since 1990 that I would like you to be the choice, and I know the decision has not been made in spite of a lot of media reports. But I want to ask you this question. Would it be fair to state that regardless of who is chosen, whether it's Mike Pence, Governor Pence, or yourself, that you will still prosecute the case against Hillary, especially on issues as important as the evil that we see unfolding in France tonight, that you would help the campaign, that any time you were needed or in some other capacity, you're on board helping Donald Trump any way you can? Is that a fair statement?GINGRICH: Look, as an American citizen who comes out a background where my dad spent 27 years in the infantry, the idea of Hillary Clinton as the most corrupt person ever to be elected to president, the most dishonest person ever to be elected president, the most destructive of national security standards ever to be elected president, the idea of her winning motivates me every morning to help Donald Trump in every way I can, because I think she would represent a disastrous future for America. And I think we need to understand and be prepared to win the argument over that case.In addition, as you were pointing out earlier, Hillary Clinton represents the State Department and the Obama administration and the total failure to confront the evil that we're now dealing with in ISIS and in Al Qaeda and in the various forms of Islamic supremacism.HANNITY: I would argue that through the prism of history, we will look back on the Obama/Hillary Clinton era as the era of radical Islamic appeasement. I think it will go down in history as that profound. Mr. Speaker, I know we took a lot of your time tonight. Thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate it.GINGRICH: Good to be with you.HANNITY: And coming up, we'll have more on the attack in Nice in France.  We'll get reaction from Donald Trump Jr. as we continue from Cleveland, Ohio. It's HANNITY on the road at the RNC convention.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And this is a Fox News alert. A massacre in France, at least 80 are dead, 50 injured, including, by the way, children and women. And of course this after a truck mowed down people during a celebration.And joining us now is Donald J. Trump Jr. That's Donald Trump Sr.'s son, of course. Don, it's good to see you. I look at this latest example of evil in our time, and I think about what this campaign is all about. And I think about your father and talking about securing the borders and your father talking about refugees and your father talking about vetting people coming into the country, and your father identifying radical Islamic terrorism. Does this really highlight the biggest national security debate we're going to have in this presidential election, another attack again?DONALD TRUMP JR., THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION: Well, good to be with you, Sean.  And I think it does. I mean, the fact that we're seeing this, we're almost getting numb to it. I turn it on, I hear about a major terrorist attack.  I say, oh, OK. It happened again.You know, it's disgusting, and it's time we do something about it. This sort of culture of appeasement that we've grown so used to and our government is just perpetuating, it just doesn't work. And we're going to have to do something about it or it's going to keep happening. It's going to happen here. It's going to happen in Europe, and it's certainly going to happen in Europe given what's going on over there right now, what's going on over there over the last few months. And we can't let them happen here. And we have to let them figure out their problem too because theirs is worse than ours. But ours is going to get there.HANNITY: And it really does highlight one of the big issues that -- I know your dad comes under fire sometimes, but I agree with him on the issue of refugees. If somebody is coming from a country where they grew up and what they understood as sharia law, men telling women how to dress, men telling women they can't drive a car, men telling women they can't go to school, persecution of gays and Christians and Jews, I think we owe it to the American people to vet those people properly. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in the numbers of refugees that Barack Obama is bringing in. What's your response?DONALD TRUMP JR.: Well, listen, A, it's crazy. B, on one of the other more liberal networks, somehow my remote got broken and I was watching one of those a little bit earlier tonight before you were on, Sean. And I don't know how it happened. I mean, every once in a while it happens but you got to see what the other side --HANNITY: I forgive you. Don't worry.DONALD TRUMP JR.: Even they were saying, hey, there's no reasonable way -- and this is right after speaking with Hillary Clinton. They're saying there's no reasonable way to actually vet these people.Now, we have no problem with immigration, but you have to know what you're bringing into your country. You can't -- it's not a gambling ring. I mean, this is not a thing we say, hey, let's take a chance. Let's see what happens. I mean, it's very clear these organizations have made it year they're going to try to use immigration as a Trojan Horse to get their combatants into our country.And this is a war, Sean. We can't be stupid. If we had a way to actually vet these guys, it may change it. But we don't. Our own people say we don't. And even if we did have a way to vet it, even if they went through the most strenuous process, it would take years to actually figure it out.  I mean, I could probably go to Syria right now, I could walk into an office and for 20 bucks get a passport telling me that I'm Moses. It's ridiculous.  And the fact that we're not acknowledging that it's ridiculous and that anyone could probably pull off everything and that there's no law and order in these places, we must be insane, Sean.HANNITY: You know, I think we should be learning the lessons of Europe with the Islamization of Europe and the refugee crisis in Europe. You know, we see these attacks again in Paris and in Belgium and in Orlando and in Chattanooga and in San Bernardino. You know, as Newt said tonight, sharia is incompatible with western civilization. Couple that with borders that are insecure. It is at the forefront of this election.Your father was supposed to -- and I actually think he made the right decision in light of what happened tonight and today. He was going to make his announcement for vice president. Newt Gingrich was on tonight and said he has not been notified by the campaign. He said he thinks that the reports may be true that it probably might be Mike Pence, and he would support him fully, but he would serve if your father asked. When would your father then likely make the announcement? I would assume he'd want to make it before the convention considering the media goes into their frenzy every time a vice presidential nominee is named.DONALD TRUMP JR.: Yes. Well, he hasn't made his announcement. I do think it's appropriate to put it off for tomorrow. You know, I would imagine it will be over the weekend, but we'll see. I think we'll get together as a family again and discuss. You know, the good thing is we have a couple great guys to choose from. I've gotten to know them. Some of them I've known for a long time, especially if you include Chris Christie in there.  All great guys, all very different characters, and it's nice to be able to say that we have this very eclectic group of guys, all of which have great experience, all of which would be happy to do it, and all of which either way we go are going to be involved in the administration going forward, because, I mean, for us, there's so much we can learn from those guys. All incredibly talented guys, all incredibly brilliant, and I'm excited to get to know them.HANNITY: I've got to run. It is amazing how your dad was willing to step out on a limb and really has predicted the narrative that would guide this election. And we're going to be talking in the days, weeks and months ahead. Don Jr., thank you so much.DONALD TRUMP JR.: Great to be with you, Sean. Thanks.HANNITY: And coming up, we'll continue to monitor all the breaking news out of Nice in France. Our panel will weigh in next. We'll check in with Sheriff Clarke, Bo Dietl, and Geraldo straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And this is a Fox News alert. Terror has struck again in France as a truck plows through a crowd, killing now at least 80, including women and children. Here with reaction, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, Geraldo Rivera, and Bo Dietl. Guys, you've been watching all night.  Sheriff Clarke, I'll start with you. Your reaction, and tie this into this election and the refugee issue and the immigration issue and the resistance to say ""radical Islamic terrorism.""SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY: Terrorists are an unconventional enemy and they use unconventional tactics, as we saw tonight. I still think our national security people are using a very conventional approach.  I'm tired of hearing about terror alerts and threat assessments. And I'm tired of getting reports that say a nonspecific threat from a credible source. Donald Trump is proven right every time one of these occurred.  Today I heard Mrs. Bill Clinton say we need an intelligence surge. Sean, I've been around intelligence a long time. I do not know what the hell that is. There is a military solution --HANNITY: She was part of the Iranian deal.CLARKE: There is a military solution. And I'm also tired of hearing how our military is trying to win hearts and minds. The purpose of our military is to identify the enemy and kill it.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Sean, following up on what Sheriff Clarke has said, I think that it is absolutely indefensible that we have allowed this caliphate to exist for so long. They are safe in their havens in Raqqa and Mosul. As we besiege them slowly, slowly, slowly, they plot these dastardly attacks -- 80 killed, you mentioned children. Look at the video on the Internet. It is as appalling as you could possibly imagine. These are savages, and the fact that we have allowed them this safe haven from which to launch these attacks on the west I think is absolutely one of the most implausible things I can possibly think of.HANNITY: Evil, Medieval barbarians, Bo Dietl, and it happened yet again.BO DIETL, FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE: Sean, this afternoon before this happened, I sent you some links from Paris. Cops getting shot, riots in the streets with these refugees, and what's happening in Germany, 1,200 people, females getting raped, London, rioting all over the place.But for some reason, our news media keeps that from the United States.  They don't want to show what this refugee influx does and what it is going to do to the United States of America. The news media is covering this up.  They should be broadcasting that night what's going on in Paris, London, and Hamburg, and all the European countries, because it's coming to the United States. And if we don't stop the immigration, you know who is coming in here. We're going to have it in our backyard. That's why Donald Trump is starting to raise in the polls. I don't care if you're a Republican, Democrat, independent, there's one man that will handle it.  Hillary Clinton will not handle this.HANNITY: Real quick, 10 seconds.RIVERA: To make it an immigration issue at this stage, right now it's a military issue. Let's wipe out the terrorists who want to wipe us off the face of the earth.HANNITY: Western civilization is at war. We'll continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: This is a Fox News alert. A French official now saying, quote, ""We are at war with terrorists,"" following, of course, the attack in France tonight. At least 80 dead, including women and children, another 50 are injured. Stay with the Fox News Channel for continuing coverage of the attack in France. Western civilization is at war, and sharia is incompatible with western civilization. Shep Smith is next.
