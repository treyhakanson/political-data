"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" April 8, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Breaking tonight.  A delegate by delegate fight breaking out, unlike any we have seen in modern history, as the Republican presidential hopefuls try to reach the magic number of 1237 to win the nomination outright or prevent their rivals from doing so in order to force a floor fight at July's convention.  Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly.  Over the past week, Senator Ted Cruz has been on a role, capitalizing on his well-organized campaign to grab a majority of delegates in North Dakota, Wisconsin, and now Colorado, where some 37 delegates in all are up for grabs.  Colorado has a very complex selection process that culminates this weekend.  It's like you've got to date Colorado, you got take it out for several drinks and finally we'll get to the weekend and see what happens.  (LAUGHTER)So far, Ted Cruz has managed to secure 21 of that state's delegates.  Donald Trump and John Kasich have been shut out so far denied.  But 13 more delegates will be awarded tomorrow.  And this is the beginning of a very complicated path that takes us through the remaining contest over the next two months.  For more on this, our chief explainer, our Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen.  James?JAMES ROSEN, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, if your head doesn't hurt by the time this segment is over, then I haven't done my job.  Consider that when New York's mostly lonely Republicans hold their primary April 19th, 81 of the 95 delegates up for grabs will reflect the results in the empire state's 27 Congressional districts.  Three delegates per district.  Clear 50 percent in a district and you get all three of its delegates.  Otherwise it's two for the top finisher, one for the runner-up. Of the remaining 14 delegates, 11 will elected at a state committee meeting, May 24, capture more than 50 percent of that vote and you sweep all 14 delegates.  If no candidate meets that threshold, the delegates get doled out proportionally.  So far most analyst agree Ted Cruz has developed a superior organization for cultivating delegates at the county and district levels.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CATLIN HUEY-BURNS, REAL CLEAR POLITICS REPORTER:  So he really doesn't have to convince the entire state of New York to support him.  He believes that Donald Trump will win, but he does think he can win over district by district and prevent Trump from getting the nomination that way.  (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN:  The first of the two remaining Super Tuesdays comes a week later on.  April 26th, when voters cast ballots in Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.  That's 172 delegates, all awarded in the same winner take most formula as New York.  June 7 brings the final Super Tuesday with contests in New Jersey, California, Montana, New Mexico and North Dakota.  That's 302 delegates up for grabs all awarded you guessed it by a winner take most formulas.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY SABATO, UVA CENTER FOR POLITICS:  The parties are Public Private Associations and they have their own rule books.  And when an election is very close in the nominating process, those rule books matter more than the primary results.  (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN:  An open question in all of this is what happens if and when these delegates in a contested convention become unbound?  Are they really free agents or will they look to their own district and party chairs or members of Congress and governors for guidance on how to vote -- Megyn.KELLY:  Yep, the head hurts.  Thanks, James.  Ted Cruz may be on a winning streak this week, but Donald Trump's new numbers -- his new numbers man says this is going to be short lived for Cruz.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAUL MANAFORT, DONALD TRUMP'S CONVENTION MANAGER:  By the time we get to California, the momentum is going to be very clear and Ted Cruz's path to victory is going to be in shambles.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Chris Stirewalt is our Fox News digital politics editor.  Tucker Carlson is editor-in-chief of ""The Daily Caller"" and co-host of ""Fox & Friends.""  And no, Stirewalt and I did not plan this, but aren't we adorable?  (LAUGHTER)And Tucker got the little pink strives (ph) too.  Like a little Easter egg.  TUCKER CARLSON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, ""THE DAILY CALLER"":  We think alike.  KELLY:  Great to see you.  CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  You bet.KELLY:  I don't know -- I have no idea what's happening in Colorado.  It's very weird.  But basically Ted Cruz is winning the weird system in Colorado right now, Stirewalt.  STIREWALT:  Look, nobody cared about -- this is always how it's been.  Nobody cared about this stuff before because guess what?  In the modern era, we've never been paying attention.  KELLY:  Who the heck wants to woo New Yorkers?  STIREWALT:  Right.  You're not like your Colorado, three dates and drink and then we'll see what happens on the weekend.  KELLY:  Yes.STIREWALT:  In New York, normally, it is just like, hey, whatever, make it happen.  But we now, I've had to learn about our -- county Republican head counts and all this stuff.  And because we're going deeper and later than we ever have.  And here is another thing, we are going to Tucker's country, we're going to California.  These things going all the way to June.  So, I'm going to have to learn a lot more.  KELLY:  Just when I thought you knew everything.  Tucker, the reason we're getting into this mind numbing stuff is that there are two contests right now.  It's the vote -- it's the push to win the votes of the people --  CARLSON:  Yes.KELLY:  -- and the push to win the votes of the delegates.  And I think most Americans didn't quite realize that there was avenue B at all.  CARLSON:  No.  Because as Chris said, they didn't have to.  It's like the 2000 recount.  The closeness has laid bare the details of the process and the closer you get, the uglier and more corrupt and flaky it looks.  It's dispiriting actually.  This is something you take for granted.  Our democracy works.  But again, the details are not something the average person has seen or really wants to see.  All of this though becomes moot if neither candidate gets to the majority of delegates.  Because after the first ballot, the delegates have an awful lot of attitude to choose who they vote for.  And at that point, what becomes the more important are the poll numbers.The sense that, as conveyed to the delegates that one of these candidates can win in the fall.  And so that's really, it's important I think for the Trump people to hire an adult with relevant experience.  They did that with Paul Manafort.  They're not too many on that campaigns so it's a good thing.  But they need to make the case about electability.  That will win delegates much more than any machinations inside the hall.  I would predict.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  So now Chris, what Trump needs to do is, you know, what he's been doing, winning contests with the people.  STIREWALT:  Right.KELLY:  But he has got to work these delegates, too, to shore them up, to win them the way that Cruz is winning them, sort of on these delegates where people vote for them.  And it's like, you don't want to know, but basically you can win them without even involving the people.  STIREWALT:  Right.KELLY:  And then shoring them up before he gets to Cleveland in July to say, vote for me and you better stick with me.  And you can come down to Mar-a-Lago if you do.  This is legal.  We just had somebody talking about this on CNN saying, totally legal, you can woo them a little.  STIREWALT:  You can woo him a little.  And you can take them to dinner and you can do whatever you want.  Look, here is the deal.  The deal is, if Donald Trump doesn't win this on the first ballot, he ain't winning.  So all this talk about, well, when the delegates unbind and all that stuff.  Well, it's not going to be Donald Trump.  If he's going to win, he has to get to 1237 on the first ballot.  It's going to be hard for him to get to the real number.  But he will be close enough, he could be close enough, if the unbound delegates who are out there, there are hundreds of them, that could come over and put him over the top, that's what he needs to do and win on the first ballot.  Because if he doesn't, his delegates will abandon him, because many of them probably hundreds of them will be party loyalists who are delegates anyway but they're not out there to --   KELLY:  Okay.  But that leads to the next question, Tucker, and the final one, which is what does Trump need to do on those electability polls to put the pressure on these people to say, you know, you may not like me, but I'm the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton, he has got to make that argument that Cruz cannot do it.  CARLSON:  If the Cleveland convention were held today, I think Chris would be absolutely right and he might be right.  But Trump needs to make the case.  First, he will clean up the campaign and refocus it and make it about voters and not himself.  But second, he needs to say, look, how many Republican voters or any voters who didn't vote for Mitt Romney in 2012 are now going to vote for Ted Cruz if he's the nominee?  And that is a very small number.  And he can say, you know, I can excite these people.  He can make a case.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.CARLSON:  But the third factor to consider is, this is the most dynamic and volatile year of any of our lifetimes on the -- right now.  So you don't really know what America is going to look like three months from now.  I mean, there could be other crises that unfold that might benefit Trump.  I mean, I just -- I think it's hard to project out and imagine tomorrow's -- extrapolation from today.  If there was any year that it's not true, this is the year.KELLY:  Great to see you.  CARLSON:  Great to see you.  STIREWALT:  You bet.  KELLY:  So, Senator Cruz's relative successes in Colorado and beyond are prompting a series of reports suggesting that there may be disorganization inside of team Trump.  Politico declared Monday, ""Trump campaign in disarray.""  And this Wednesday from NBC, Infighting, frustration rile Trump's team,"" say sources.  Today, ""The Washington Post"" saying, Donald Trump's terrible night in Colorado exemplifies his campaign's Achilles heel.  But is that true?  Joining me now, Katrina Pierson, national spokesperson for the Trump campaign.  And Rich Lowry who is a Fox News contributor and editor at National Review.  Good to see you both.  RICH LOWRY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, Megyn.  KATRINA PIERSON, DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON:  Hi, Megyn.KELLY:  So Katrina, the media, they love these stories.  We saw this four years ago.  Any sort of campaign shuffle or shakeup of any sort is like, they're falling apart!  So, you tell me whether that is real or that is wishful thinking by the publications we just listed.  PIERSON:  It is completely wishful thinking.  You know, the rumors of the Trump campaign demise are greatly exaggerated.  What we are seeing is the party apparatus in this state which is how the delegates are chosen and you just went through that entire discussion.  Mr. Trump has won 21 states.  Senator Cruz has won nine.  We won seven of Senator Cruz's states that he was supposed to win.  Yet there's this magical ground game that we're talking about.  Because Cruz is racking up delegates and the reason for that simply is this delegate system is an extension of the state Republican Party.  Therefore, a construction worker who maybe has two shifts and only been involved in the process for one or two cycles is not going to make it beyond the pyramid process from the precinct level or even the Congressional district.  He's working with the establishment and that's how he's getting those delegates.  KELLY:  Everything she just said is right, is it not, Rich?  I mean, that is all true?  Is it not?LOWRY:  Yes, and I think anyone who is writing Trump's political obituary is making a huge mistake.  A big win in New York, a big win in California.  It picks off a few unexpected states in between.  He can get to 1237, above  1237 and all of this is kind of academic.  But it is true that the Trump campaign wasn't built for this.  It was basically built as a media operation, with Donald Trump going from phone interview to phone interview, and that worked brilliantly, much better than anyone would expected.  But now we may really be getting into this granular delegate by delegate fight, and Ted Cruz is built for that, because there's nothing corrupt about it or establishment about it, it's just that he his campaign is a grassroots campaign that depends on organizing.  This is what it's been from the beginning.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  LOWRY:  And if he wins the nomination, that is what's going to be at the end.  KELLY:  The Republican Party for all of its victory has given.  Power to these delegates is just we haven't really paid any attention to it.  Katrina, let me ask you because there were also reports that Donald Trump is, he is taking a few days and he's, you know, not as much on twitter and he's kind of thinking about things and he brought in this guy Manafort who everybody says is very good.  Is there a shift happening here or what is happening?PIERSON:  Well, there's an expansion that's happening here.  And if it were true what Rich said is that he has this masterful -- Ted Cruz has this masterful ground game, he would have won those seven states that Donald Trump won.  So, it's simple not true.  The Trump campaign has focus and as Mr. Manafort said earlier today on an interview, every campaign has a turning point when it's time to focus on something else.  Megyn, you'll have to remember, when this first began in June and Mr. Trump shot to the top, it was very much -- he was very much the guy to beat.  Now we have the GOP establishment joining with some conservatives who supposedly wanted to fight the establishment and we have this anti-Trump movement on top of that.  We have the GOP literally telling everyone we are not going to let the people choose our nominee.  So, of course Mr. Trump brings in someone that specializes in the convention process, because again, this is a party apparatus.  They've already publicized the fact that they don't want Trump or Cruz.  So if Cruz wants to allow himself to be that Trojan horse in the convention, go right ahead.  But we are confident that we're going to get those delegates by the time we get there.  KELLY:  What do you think of that Rich?  Is there a chance, you know, that -- I mean, a realistic chance that Trump is going to get that 1237  number before -- or as of June 7th, which is the very last day that they vote?LOWRY:  Yes.  There's some quite realistic chance.  I would say 30 percent chance or so.  But if it goes to a convention, the rule is you have to get a majority of the delegates.  And there's a reason for that rule, it's very basic.  That's the minimum requirement for showing you have a consensus of the party.  And if no one gets there, then the rule of delegates comes in.  KELLY:  But wait, but let me just say --  PIERSON:  They can change the rules.  They can change the rules.  KELLY:  If you're looking for consensus and you get to the second ballot and still somebody, you know, who just one of those three guys doesn't get it and they do parachute in a third person, I guess a fourth person because Kasich's up there too.  That's not a consensus candidate.  LOWRY:  Yes.  Well, I think that scenario is very unlikely and I would counsel against it.  But the paradox and I want to underline the point that Tucker made, the general election polls are very important.  Because the paradox had Trump is that he's rocketed to front-runner status in the Republican nomination battle.  At the same time, he's made himself toxic with the general public.  Nearly 70 percent disapproval rating in his A.P. poll this week.  Donald Trump loves to talk about polls.  There's a reason he's not talking about general election polls very much recently.  Also in that A.P. poll, 30 percent of Republicans say they wouldn't vote for Donald Trump in the fall.  That is a party heading to a debacle.  There's no way that delegates if they had a major rule at this convention are going to forge a suicide pack with Donald Trump for the fall.  PIERSON:  In that same poll though, Megyn, in that same poll --  KELLY:  Yes.PIERSON:  Ted Cruz is at 60 percent unfavorable, and Hillary Clinton is only five points down from Trump.  There have been many elections in the past where the front-runner at this point in time was 20 to 25 points behind.  KELLY:  I think if Donald Trump is at 59 percent unfavorable, Ted Cruz is at 59 percent unfavorable and Hillary Clinton is down at 55 percent unfavorable.  So pick your poison, American people.  Thank you both so much for being here.  CARLSON:  Thanks so much.  KELLY:  So one political analyst says, came up with five possible outcomes at the GOP convention.  They are easy to understand.  Look, we even did a fancy graphic.  And coming up, we'll going to give you the odds on which of these five outcomes is the most likely.  Plus, with another contentious week on the campaign trail, coming to a close, Mark McKinnon, one of the creator of the Showtime hit ""The  Circus"" is back again with some of the key moments you didn't see but should.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wisconsin would be the last best chance for the challengers to make a play.  Someone but Trump or Clinton has to win or --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's over.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's all but over.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think there's a very good chance Cruz will win and win big here.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Well, Showtime's popular series ""The Circus"" has been giving viewers a front row seat to the 2016 presidential campaign.  Now the show's producers are hitting the pause button to reflect on how we got to this point, and one of their key moments involves the run-up to this week's primary in Wisconsin.  Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm getting tired of you guys.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This stage has got a traditional -- all over the place.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You've got really conservative, Tea Party movement here and then you have of course labor unions, a huge part of the politics in this state.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's some pretty rich history.  1960 John Kennedy runs against Humphreys.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kennedy have lost the 60 primary in Wisconsin -- probably would have been the Democratic nominee.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wisconsin could be the last best chance for the challengers to make a play.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Someone but Trump or Clinton has to win here or --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's over.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's all but over.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that's a very good chance Cruz will win and maybe win big here.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Any state that has any sort of retail campaign and capacity to organize, where you have to really do something strategic, Cruz outruns him.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kasich doesn't really think he can win the primary.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  John Kasich is now in the delegate accumulation business.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's right.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's not in the winning state business.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a game of checkers and he's trying to play chess.  But --UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Bernie Sanders fans think that we have all buried Bernie Sanders too early.  They are constantly howling all you (bleep) in the media who say this race is over according to some people at this table, I'm talking about media.  They even saying, look, this race is alive and we'll going to show you right here in Wisconsin.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They might be right.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If Trump and Clinton both get beaten here, it blows up the narrative of this race is all but done.  You take the fork that was in the race like this and you pull the fork out of the race like that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me now, Mark McKinnon, co-creator of ""The Circus"" and former chief media adviser to President George W. Bush.  Good to see you, Mark.  So, I guess I saw you drinking in this clip.  Looks pretty fun out there.  I don't know why we're feeling sorry for you guys on the road all the time. Mark -- and that moment is pretty interesting, because earlier on ""The Circus"" he had stuck the knife into the steak saying thing race is over and now he's saying, no, this race is not over on either side.  MARK MCKINNON, CO-CREATOR OF ""THE CIRCUS"":  That's right.  Yes.  John stuck a fork in it a couple of weeks ago and last week he pulled the fork out of it.  I mean, the biggest prediction that we made that was wrong was that in the very beginning, we budgeted the show and we had 24 episodes and we said we have to save some for the summer and some for the fall.  So, let's just do 10 for the spring.  We've been extending it to 12.  But there's, you know, still not resolved.  And it could go all the way to the convention.  But we've got to hit the pause button as you said and we'll be up for the summer, for the convention and then back-up to the general election in the fall.  But it's been a really exciting, dramatic race and it may just continue to be that way.  KELLY:  Why was the estimate so off?  I mean, because Trump lost Wisconsin and Hillary lost Wisconsin?  Because, you know, Trump, he lost Wisconsin, it was a setback but he has got New York right around the corner.  MCKINNON:  Well, it was so off because you look out historically and a year ago when we planned this thing, we said, yes, it will probably be wrapped up after Super Tuesday.  KELLY:  Yes.  But I mean, the prediction that it's done.  The prediction that it's done.  You know, he was saying that the race --  MCKINNON:  Oh, oh, oh.  Yes, well, I mean, first of all you look at the delegates and the super delegates on the Democratic side and all those super delegates are really likely to go to Clinton.  I mean, there's, you know, convenient theory put forward by the Sanders' people that it went to get down, that if the delegate count is close, that those super delegates will look and they look at polls and say perhaps Sanders is better general election candidate, stronger that they might switch.  The fact is, that those super delegates are really dedicated long time loyalist to Clinton and very unlikely to switch.  And, you know, a couple of weeks ago, it looked like Trump was having a pretty good run and at least on a traditional path, it wins New York, wins california that you would likely get pretty close to the majority of delegates needed.  KELLY:  That's her ace in the hole, those super delegates.  Because even if Bernie gets very close to her in the delegates she gets from winning the races, she too has this ace in the hole, she's sort to has what Cruz has which is things that are available not from -- not via the will of the people.  Well, that's right.  And these super delegates, you know, they go back decades with the Clintons.  Ninety five percent of people that worked with the Clintons in those '72 McGovern campaign.  I mean, that just goes back forever.  So they're deeply loyal to the Clintons and it's just unlikely under any scenario that they would come unglued and go with Sanders at some point in the race.  So, those super delegates are big thing in the pocket of the Clinton campaign.  Not to be underestimated.KELLY:  It's amazing.  It's amazing how that race keeps going and he's got a lot of money in the coffers.  Bernie Sander does and it's not --   MCKINNON:  Forty four million just in the last month, amazing.  KELLY:  I can't put it the way you put it on your clip.  But he had a message, yes, for the --  MCKINNON:  He's got the passion, he's got the burn.  KELLY:  Mark, it's great to see you.  MCKINNON:  Thanks for having us on.  KELLY:  Well, with the contested convention looking more and more likely tonight, one political analyst has come up with five possible outcomes at the GOP convention.  They are easy to understand.  And coming up, we will give you the odds on which one is most likely.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER:  From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.  KELLY:  Breaking tonight.  The Republican race to the nomination may be more complicated than we've seen in years.  But this week, a veteran political scientist by the name of Norm Ornstein posted a piece of analysis at the Atlantic offering five possible outcomes on how the Republican race could end.  Convention expert Tom Bevan will give us his odds on each scenario in a moment.  But first we go to Trace Gallagher who has the breakdown on what to expect.  Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, regardless of how the nomination process ends, we know for sure that it won't end until at least June 7th, the day of the last GOP contest.  There is no realistic way for any candidate to get to 1237 delegates before then.  And the truth is, unless something miraculous happens, only Donald Trump has a path to actually hit 1237.  So the first scenario is very simple.  Donald Trump goes on a roll, hits the magic number on June 7th and becomes the nominee.  The second scenario would be that Donald Trump falls short of 1237 but in the 45 days between the last primary and the start of the convention, Trump is somehow able to gather enough unbound delegates to push him over the top.  But that would mean the GOP establishment would have to coalesce around Donald Trump in the hope of avoiding a contested convention.  Scenario three is the one Ted Cruz is hoping for, and that's a contested convention where Donald Trump loses on the first ballot and then delegates become unbound.  And because the Cruz campaign has been very effective at going state to state, courting those delegates, on the second ballot, they dump Trump, climb on board with Cruz and make him the nominee.  That might please some of the GOP establishment like Lindsey Graham, Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, but it would infuriate Trump supporters which could lead to chaos in Cleveland.  Scenario four goes like this.  GOP party leaders decide to propose new rules, allowing other candidates into the mix, maybe paving the way for someone like Paul Ryan.  But in that scenario, Trump and Cruz could fight back by creating an alliance and pooling their delegates.  Even setting up a Trump-Cruz ticket.  Scenario five, we could call the Karl Rove scenario.  Looking for a fresh face on the presidential ballot.  Listen.  Scenario five, we could call the Karl Rove scenario. Looking for a fresh face on the presidential ballot. Listen.(END VIDEO CLIP)KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR IN HUGH HEWITT SHOW: Somebody who has, you know, has those convictions that they express in a compelling way, we could come out of the convention in a relatively strong position.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: And the idea there is to stop the bleeding to find someone who may not beat Hillary Clinton but would at least get Republicans to show up and vote to maintain control of the House and Senate. If you think Cleveland rocks now, we'll wait until July. Megyn?MEGYN KELLY, THE KELLY FILE HOST: Wow, very clear. Thank you, Trace. Well, many possibilities but there will only be one outcome. Joining me now, Tom Bevan. He's the co-founder of RealClearPolitics.com, favorite web site by the way, and he's going to tell us which one of these is actually going to happen. So, which is it?(LAUGHTER)TOM BEVAN, REALPOLITICS.COM CO-FOUNDER: I don't know, Megyn. Nobody knows. Look, I think if you look at scenario number one, I'd rate that at about 25 percent, one in four chance that Trump .KELLY: Trump wins outright.BEVAN: . will get -- that he wins outright, and that will become a lot clearer after New York here in about 11 days. If he can stay above 50 percent and sweep up a lot of those delegates, that will boost him moving into those -- those other East Coast primaries and the other state to watch incidentally is Indiana. That's a big one that's being sort of overlooked. If Trump can win in Indiana, that will set him up for, you know, a pretty good position in California and in that case, he probably would get there but he's not going to get there by much yet he gets there is going to be just a few delegates.KELLY: It's going to come down to June 7th, at best for these candidates. No would -- nobody is getting the nomination before June 7th at the earliest.BEVAN: That's right.KELLY: OK.BEVAN: And -- and so if you look at scenario number two where Trump is short, I would give that about -- about -- about .KELLY: Yes, the scenario two .BEVAN: . a little bit higher at 20 .KELLY: . is we get to June 7th, all the voting is done and Trump is the leader, but he doesn't have 1,237.  So, how does he quote, ""make up"" the difference between June 7th and the convention in late July?BEVAN: Well, he's going to have to woo these delegates like -- like Stirewalt was saying earlier, you know, we're going to think about the dinner. He's going to -- he's got a backroom deal, you know, this is .(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Which ones?BEVAN: . he said -- he says -- he ways, he's a dealmaker, and he's going to have to prove it, and he's hired a guy in Paul Manafort that -- that that's his -- that's his expertise .(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But which ones do they go to?BEVAN: . is to find the delegate.KELLY: The ones who are not bound who are -- who are going to the convention at the various starts but they're -- they're not pledged (ph).  So, it's like, ""I don't have a partner .BEVAN: That's right.KELLY: I'm available. I like Mar-a-Lago (ph).BEVAN: That's right.KELLY: Right?  That has no worked.BEVAN: Yes, exactly. They're free agents. There are -- it's -- that's exactly right.  And -- and again, it's going to matter how close he gets to the number, and I will use 1200 as sort of a break-even point. If he gets to 1,200, you know, he's probably -- he could probably get there. If he's under 1,200, I think it's going to be a lot harder and it's going to -- it's going to also depend how he finishes off. If he's got momentum heading in to California beyond California, I think it will be easier for him to sweep up some of these delegates. If he stumbles, you know, finishes it with whimper. It's going to be a little bit harder for him.KELLY: So, we understand how it happens that, you know, Cruz would win on the second ballot, now, but do you -- what about this other scenario where Trump and Cruz unite to give the establishment one of these if the establishment .BEVAN: Right.KELLY: . whoever the establishment is, just go with it, wants to pilot in a third party candidate. Do you think there's any chance these two men actually want to combining for, you know, a president-vice president combo?BEVAN: It seems unlikely. But, you know, look, we've had Stranger Bedfellows. I mean, JFK despised Lyndon Johnson ended with him on the tickets. So, it seems stuff like this happened in the past.Trace mentioned the rules, but imagine this, Megyn, so Trump, I agree, it's -- he's either gets it on the first ballot or he's done. Cruz is to going to have his chance to flex his delegate muscles. If he can get it on the second -- second ballot, if he gets denied on the second ballot, then he might be done.The longer this goes on, the more ballots it goes, the more pressure is going to be on these -- on these delegates to find a compromise candidate. So, the worse is going to get Trump and Cruz may end up on the look -- on the outside looking in. So, maybe perhaps on -- on the third delegate, Cruz goes to Trump and says, ""Hey, let's pool our delegates. We've combined, unified ticket,"" and -- and suddenly that's how I think the small -- small chance of that, maybe 10 percent, but it is definitely something that could happen.KELLY: We've got to eat our Wheaties (ph) in the month of July. Getting ready for that thing. Tom, great to see you, very clear. Thank you.BEVAN: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Well, President Bill Clinton was doing a little damage control today after he went head to head with protesters from the Black Lives Matter Movement yesterday. We showed this to you. Robert Zimmerman and Eboni Williams are next on what this means for President Clinton and for his wife, who would like to be President Clinton.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Hi. New fallout for the Clinton campaign today after President Bill Clinton dust-up with the group of Black Lives Matter Protesters created some unwanted heartburn as opposed to the wanted heartburn for his wife's campaign. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens.(CROWD CHEERING)She didn't. She didn't! You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter. Tell the truth!(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And while many have argued that President Clinton was making valid points, the former president came just inches away from apologizing today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: So, I did something yesterday in Philadelphia, I almost want to apologize for it, but I want to use it as an example of the danger threatening our country. I rather vigorously defended my wife as I'm one to do, and I realized finally I was talking past her the way she is talks past me. We've got to stop that in this country. We've got to listen to each other.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: The question now as Vanity Fair summed up in this headline is whether President Clinton is losing his political mojo? Robert -- Robert Zimmerman is the DNC committee member and Clinton supporter. Eboni Williams is a Fox News Contributor. Good to see you both.ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE MEMBER: Good to be with you.KELLY: So, there was a -- I mean, did -- did the campaign take him behind the woodshed and say, ""Mr. President, not helpful?""ZIMMERMAN: Never works that way .(CROSSTALK)KELLY: If not  (ph) .ZIMMERMAN: . not with -- not with Bill Clinton certainly and very frankly .KELLY: But his wife could do it.ZIMMERMAN: Yes, I think -- what they discussed amongst themselves is I'm not privy to. But the bottom-line is that was a real authentic moment.KELLY: Yes.ZIMMERMAN: I mean, we always talk about wanting to see our political leaders unscripted and just being candid, and that's what it was.KELLY: He was fiery. He was fiery, but .ZIMMERMAN: He was fiery.KELLY: . is it politically risky?ZIMMERMAN: You know, something - I don't think for a moment. Let's remember the Crime Bill that he's talking about was supported by half of the Black Congressional Caucus by many African-American clergy. It was dealing with the real crime crisis in America. One of the unintended consequences was mass incarceration. Hillary Clinton has acknowledged that, and she has tried address it in this campaign, so is Bill Clinton for that matter.KELLY: Yes.ZIMMERMAN: But I think - having those kinds unscripted candid moments I think is very good for the system and good for the -- good for our debate.KELLY: Is there an opportunity here do you think for Bernie Sanders to make inroads with Black Democratic voters because the assumption going into this race was Hillary Clinton has got those folks locked up that they love Bill Clinton. They'll probably love her, too.EBONI WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Oh, surely (ph), Megyn. Look, here's the issue. I agree, there was a moment of truth and certainly honesty to Robert's point in what we saw from Bill Clinton. But for many in the black community, Megyn, they feel like there is at best a conflict. Because last summer at the NAACP convention, President Clinton said, ""You know what, the scope was maybe indeed too broad. Too many black people were incarcerated in for too long.""So then they hear him kind of back pedaling (ph) now, it does seem inconsistent at best. Here's the other issue, politically very risky because black voters are probably been the most consistent voter base for Hillary Clinton. The south, she absolutely does have that firewall that she spoke up. That's a place Bernie Sanders has not been able to permeate, and so indeed, if he's able to get even a little bit of that part of the electorate, that can make a big difference for him.KELLY: This time we're waiting to see the New York vote, right?WILLIAMS: Yes.KELLY: And this is her adopted home state.WILLIAMS: Right.KELLY: Will you make -- I mean, we actually ran a report on how many times she swiped this - the metro card, and how it should have been easier and then she went on the subway and she had -- and maybe she violated rules. It got a lot of presses the point.ZIMMERMAN: Of course.KELLY: So -- and -- and people said she didn't look real because we all know she doesn't take the subway, Robert. We all know that.ZIMMERMAN: Hey, look. I'm .(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Finally, she has to pretend she takes it.ZIMMERMAN: . I've had difficulty with my metro card, too.KELLY: Me, too. I said that last night.ZIMMERMAN: OK, OK, OK.WILLIAMS: I don't.  I don't. I don't know why.(CROSSTALK)ZIMMERMAN: So, those .(CROSSTALK)KELLY: So, at times it would be .(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)KELLY: . around the first time.ZIMMERMAN: Look, here's the point. In the scrutiny of the presidential campaign, you've got political pundits with too much time on their hands. So, they're going to obsess about the metro card and they've got to make you .KELLY: But she is the one who went on the subway like she is woman of the people.ZIMMERMAN (?): Hey.KELLY: But maybe -- but she does not have to ride the subway falsely .ZIMMERMAN (?): Hey.KELLY: . to tell us that.ZIMMERMAN: Did you say Ted Cruz trying to make muscle (ph) yesterday? He look .KELLY: Well, problems on both sides.ZIMMERMAN: . exactly. I mean, yes.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Here's the question now, Robert, right. I mean, I think we all know, because when -- when she came out of the White House, they were talking how they were broken, and I think for most Americans that felt a bit, you know, I think you can maybe even offensive. Just be OK with who you are, and your stature and how far you've come and maybe people can palate that more.(CROSSTALK)ZIMMERMAN: You know something .KELLY: And she came out and said .ZIMMERMAN: Yeah.KELLY: . ""I haven't taken the subway -- I haven't taken the subway in years."" You know what, I'm the former .(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I'm the first lady .KELLY: . first lady.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I was the secretary of state.ZIMMERMAN: And then .(CROSSTALK)KELLY: This is one of the fringe benefits of being me.WILLIAMS: They got one (ph).ZIMMERMAN: By the way, then they got political pundits talking about her not being in touch. The bottom-line is if she wasn't authentic, she wasn't herself. She wouldn't have been elected to the Senate from New York. She wouldn't have been reelected. This is a pretty tough scrutinizing State of New York.KELLY: How about Bernie Sanders saying, ""I've used a token -- I've used the token to get on.""WILLIAMS: Oh, that's why -- that's the issue, right. So, every time .KELLY: He can't use the token anymore.WILLIAMS: . you want -- right. You know, you want to say Bernie has an opening, right, or there's an opportunity here. He also voted for the 1994 bill.KELLY: That's right.ZIMMERMAN: That's right.WILLIAMS: So, you know, they really are two sides of different -- of the same coin rather and so it's really tough for many in the -- of the people community so to speak, to identify with either on some level.KELLY: So, it's - as I said earlier .ZIMMERMAN: Of the .KELLY: . pick your poison. Got to go.WILLIAMS: Yeah. I agree.ZIMMERMAN: OK.KELLY: Thank you, both.Coming up, wait until you see how some students want the girl behind this pro-Trump post punished, that's a lot of alliteration. We will bring you the latest dispatch from Cupcake Nation, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think the law and I this is what it looks like to actually get in the way of what it is -- of what might(CROSSTALK -- MULTIPLE SPEAKERS)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Another dispatch from Cupcake Nation tonight, as student protesters at a University in Portland descend on a pro-Trump meeting organized by their peers not to engage in a debate, but rather to silence the pro-Trump students for holding political views other than their own. It happens all the time. Trace Gallagher, live on our West Coast Newsroom with the story. Trace?GALLAGHER: Megyn, the meeting in Portland State was standing room only filled with both Trump supporters and protesters. It was rockiest (ph), contentious, bordering (ph) on ferocious. They were able to hold their fists, but their voices ran unfiltered. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You (BEEP) shut on (BEEP) (BEEP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go to the students and don't disrupt meeting.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE: Can't stop the Trump! Can't stop the Trump! Can't stop the Trump!(SHOUTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Amid the F-bombs (ph) and insults, there were some short-lived pockets of calm even brief moments of rational dialogue. Watch again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't see why it's fair to let other people.  We are going to VCRs (ph) because the criminals can take anything. Just the love the country with that sort of reinvesting or anything of that.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, he has made very clear though is that he hates Mexicans, he hates Muslims people.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In case they need it .(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are you -- why are you start -- students against Trump?(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: But in the end, those who support Donald Trump felt drowned out by those who don't and though the meeting was never officially adjourned, students for Trump steadily left the building which emboldened the protesters. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I fell good at (BEEP).UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you do this (BEEP).(SHOUTING)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're coming back.UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE: We're coming back.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Later on social media, students for Trump called the meeting a win suggesting the display reflected poorly on the protesters. Megyn?KELLY: Trace, thank you.While the attack on political speech hitting the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, as Haley Puckett, a newly elected student Senator joined friends in choking (ph) pro-Trump art and messages on campus. Now, peers claim she is not fit to represent them in the student Senate and they are demanding that she resign from her student government post. Haley Puckett has a response for those critics and she joins me now.Haley, how are you doing? So, you decide to go down with some friends to the sidewalk and to express your support for Donald Trump. How? Explain what you wrote.HALEY PUCKETT, UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, CHATTANOOGA, STUDENT:  Well, we went down to Heritage Plaza and they already started to working on the artwork and they wrote, ""Trump 2016"" and drew a hat with, ""Make America great again"" and then my friends drew a wall right underneath the artwork, so.KELLY: And what was the first whiff you got that this was wrong from -- according to your peers?PUCKETT: Well, I put it on Twitter, and after about 26 minutes, a bunch of people just started tweeting at me and very harsh and threatening things. So, I was just like, ""I'll just take it down because if it's hurting that many people, I'll take it down."" So I did.KELLY: Why can't you have your point of view that you like Donald Trump and -- and are in favor of a wall to protect the Southern Border, and they have their view and everyone gets to express it?PUCKETT: Yeah. That's the same feeling I have. I feel that I don't really question their opinions, so I don't feel like they should have to question mine.KELLY: But even if they question your opinions, I think what we just saw at that other university  where they're serving up they're fighting .PUCKETT: Yeah.KELLY: . the dialogue was a little dicey, but at least they're fighting and they're expressing ideas. In your campus, they want you fired. They want you off the student -- the student government. Why? Because of the chalk? Because you wrote make America great again with a wall?PUCKETT: Well, everything has been taken a little out of context. They are saying that the wall is about division and that we want unity on campus but we also want to include everyone. So, it's just kind of hard to say that I'm wrong and then also say, that you want unity. So, it's just .KELLY: Haley, why do you like Donald Trump? Why -- why are supporting him?PUCKETT: Well, I feel like that he can bring up our economy and just help everything about the United States.KELLY: We will continue to follow your story. By the way, are you going to resign?PUCKETT: No. I am not going to resign. I was elected by my students and my district, and I feel that if they elect me then I want to serve them.KELLY: Good for you. Thanks for being here tonight. We'll be right back.PUCKETT: All right. Thank you so much.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: A great day today in New York as variety magazine hosted its Power of Women New York Event. Some well-known faces were recognized for their charitable works, including actresses Lupita Nyong'o, Julianne Moore, fashion designer, Vera Wang, an amazing and groundbreaking ballet dancer Misty Copeland. Yours truly honored to be there and was given the chance to speak about my favorite charity, Child Help.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Child Help is brave. Yvonne and Sarah are brave. They do not look away. They intervene to prevent the abuse through in-school education programs trying to show kids what abuse is. And how to stop it, what to do if it's happening to them.To stop the abuse, with their 24/7 national hotline, 1800-4-A-child, staffed by professional crisis counselors. Most of whom have master's degrees and can provide help in 170 languages. To heal the wounds of abuse with recovery centers known as Villages where the most severely abused and neglected children go for love and counseling, but it takes money to help the children which is where we come in.Imagine being the one whose donation helps a child out of an abusive home and into a facility that greets every boy and girl with the words, ""All who enter here will find love.""(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That number is 1800-4-A-child or childhelp.org. Surrounded by powerful women today, we also discussed the concept of fearlessness. A word it seems we're hearing a lot lately about women and girls in particular.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Some have used that word fearless about me. And it's wrong. I am not fearless nor do I know any fearless people. This seems to be a new standard, a new goal that we are setting for people. Go forth unafraid. You go forth unafraid. I'm scared about a lot often. Fear is normal. The goal is not to get rid of it. The goal is to walk through it.(APPLAUSE)Courage is what we need. Courage. If you can muster courage in the face of fear you become more confident. You become tougher. Vanity Fair called me the toughest anchor at Fox. OK. I'm tough. But I cry. I worry. I have fear. I have self-doubt. I have insecurities. I have cellulite. What?(LAUGHTER)I don't want to lose or fail or embarrass myself any more than the next gal, but I am willing to take the risk of doing all that and more for the chance to make my life sing. To make it sing.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: But by the summer, I'm going to work on that. I'm going to look like Misty Copeland because I'm going to eat well, I'm going to exercise.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"": Breaking tonight. Donald Trump making some serious campaign changes in an attempt to lock up the Republican nomination for president.Welcome to THE KELLY FILE, everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. Just days after Donald Trump lost the Wisconsin primary to rival Ted Cruz, a brand new poll from the Associated Press defines the challenge for the general election. Right now, nearly seven in 10 Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Donald Trump. And that includes whites, blacks, and Latinos, men and women, and more. The survey -- not more than me and women -- other is -- the survey sampled voters from across the country, even before this poll, however. A series of reports today suggested the Trump campaign is getting serious about building more support, about getting ready for policy speeches and trying to win more support in Washington. They're hiring more political pros, as well to help with the delegate battle. We have got the campaign trail covered for you tonight with Newt Gingrich, Charles Krauthammer, Karl Rove and Ben Carson.But we begin tonight with Trace Gallagher reporting from our West coast newsroom on the Trump campaign and the changes there. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And Megyn, after weeks of saying a contested convention would be unfair, would have too much influence from party leaders or could lead to riots, it appears the Trump campaign has done the math and realizes a contested contention as a strong possibility and is now preparing to play ball in Cleveland. Today Trump announced that one of his newest hires, lobbyist Paul Manafort who has worked for several presidents will now quoting, ""Oversee, manage and be responsible for all activities to Mr. Trump delegate process and the Cleveland Convention."" But critics say, Manafort is going to be playing catchup to what many called Ted Cruz's effective ground campaign that by many accounts has already wooed several, if not dozens of free agent delegates and delegates that would be unbound after the first convention vote.The Trump campaign is also shifting and expanding. First, reaching out to prominent GOP lawmakers in Washington, looking for support. And now planning to hire some big names to help the campaign effort. But these high profile moves come as the candidate himself is keeping a low profile. Donald Trump has cleared his schedule for the next few days cancelling a news conference in California and skipping the Colorado State GOP Convention. In the past 48 hours, Trump's media omnipresence has also largely disappeared. The only scheduled interviews we could find was with Brian Kilmeade. The campaign says, this is not an indication Trump is lacking energy, only that he's working hard to run his campaign and his multibillion dollar company -- Megyn.KELLY: Uh-hm. Trace, thank you. Well, our lead guest tonight is Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House and author of the book ""Duplicity."" Mr. Speaker, it's great to see you. I can't get enough of that. You know me.NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I just love to hear you say that.KELLY: I can't wait to read it now.GINGRICH: Here we go.KELLY: Let's talk about this AP poll. This is how they put it. They say for Americans of nearly every race gender political persuasion and location disdain for Donald Trump runs deep saddling the Republican frontrunner with unprecedented unpopularity. I mean, when they're saying70 percent of the country doesn't like him, and by the way, it's not much better for his rivals, but let's just start with Trump, what does that portend for this race and including the general election?GINGRICH: Well, you don't quite know. Clearly it means that at some point in your future, he has got to pivot and try to figure out messages and tactics that reach a lot more people. It could lead you particularly because I think Secretary Clinton's numbers are pretty negative, too.KELLY: Uh-hm.GINGRICH: You could end up with one of these weird races where the least unpopular survives at the very end, which would not I think be healthy for the country. I would rather have a positive race where you actually have ideas and a choice of two philosophies. But Trump clearly -- look, I think it's actually good that he's off the trail for a couple of days. He had a particular shtick. It was amazing, it got him from June the 16th to about three weeks ago. He should have hired somebody like Paul Manafort about six weeks ago. He's now finally being taken seriously, the need to run a much bigger campaign. And I think in that sense, stopping, taking a deep breath, doing some planning, is more important than the next six rallies in terms of whether or not he survives. He's at a real turning point at his campaign and he has to get this larger act together or he won't be competitive.KELLY: What do you make of the fact that the numbers got worse for him since February? So this poll had him about, I don't know, around 58 percent unfavorable back in July. And then still all the way through February, he's at 58 percent unfavorable. And then it jumps up 11 points to 69 percent unfavorable just as of late March into this early April period. So what was it? I mean, we're all talking about the Heidi-Cruz tweet, you know, the abortion like, what did that?GINGRICH: I think there were a series of things like that that were mishandled and I also think he had a particular technique of attacking, which worked very, very well, up through Marco Rubio. But then there was a moment where people got tired of it. And he's been trying to use it on Cruz and it doesn't work. I thought the statement that the Trump people put out after Wisconsin was exactly wrong. You know, we have a tradition in America. If the other guy beats you fair and square, you're gracious. You say, you know, Ted Cruz had a great night, welcome to New York.KELLY: Mitt Romney did that with you when you won South Carolina.GINGRICH: Exactly. In fact, he called me and he said, yes, we have a big victory here tonight. So I think Donald would actually be better off to be a little more gracious and he'd be very well off to stop and take seriously these polling numbers. Doesn't mean they can't change --KELLY: Uh-hm.GINGRICH: It doesn't mean the race is over. There was a 36-point swing for Ronald Reagan between March and the election. There was something like a 25-point swing for George H.W. Bush between May and the election of 1988. So you can have very big swings but you don't get there by accident and you don't get there by continuing to do the things that aren't working.KELLY: Right. Because right now, he's got everybody beating up on him. He has got Ted Cruz beating up on him, John Kasich, he has got these Super PACs. Even Hillary, you know, he's not the nominee yet, is releasing ads against him. And so he's sort of bloodied and bruised right now. But, you know, if he can get on message, and just sort of stay on a sort of clean message, pro-Republicans and anti-Hillary or whatever, he'll do much better.GINGRICH: He'll do a lot better almost overnight if he shifts his messaging. And I think if he gives a serious and major speeches, for example, if he gives a serious speech, that's well thought out, much like the AIPAC speech was on the kind of judges he would appoint, and if he has a set of names that the conservative leadership in this country can say wow, that would be the right kind of people to replace Scalia. That's a building block back. It doesn't solve everything, but there are a series of speeches like that that could actually bring you back a long way.KELLY: Uh-hm. And fewer distractions where, you know, sort of these meandering down the mean tweet lane.GINGRICH: I think he ought of have. And I say this, somebody who has gotten himself in trouble occasionally with tweeting and everything else, I think it would be very healthy for Trump to have somebody else read all of his tweets before they go out.KELLY: I think he should hire Dana Perino. She's the best communications person in Republican politics.(LAUGHTER)She can be the clearing house before he sends anything else. I want to ask you about --  GINGRICH: I'll tell you what, if he announces Dana Perino is helping him, you'll know he's turned a corner.KELLY: And reaching out --GINGRICH: That's right.KELLY: I want to ask you about his rivals because I mentioned at the beginning. Ted Cruz is viewed unfavorably by 59 percent, only ten points lower than Donald Trump I guess better in this context. And 55 percent have negative views of Hillary Clinton. So she comes to New York today, this is her adopted home state, and this was her outreach to show she's a woman of the people, Mr. Speaker. She's trying to get on the subway. She runs the metro card. No, try again. No. We've all been there, we've all been there Madame Secretary. No. But does anybody believe that Hillary Clinton is taking the subway and that seeing her on the subway makes her real and we can relate to her? You tell me, is this effective politics?GINGRICH: The problem, the deepest problem Secretary Clinton has, and I worked with her before. She's a very smart person. The biggest problem she has is, that she is authentically inauthentic. You know, that she cannot do anything that's authentic, because she calculates and she thinks, I mean, nobody believes Hillary Clinton is a woman of the subway.KELLY: Right. And we don't need her to be. Right? It's like --  GINGRICH: Right.KELLY: Who needs her to be?GINGRICH: You know, one of Roger Ailes great advice was to Richard Nixon in 1967 when he said to him, you have to learn to be who you really are on television, because television doesn't let you lie. And he said, and the fact is, you're not going to be likable, but you can be respectable. People can decide in the middle of a war, you're the guy they respect to lead the country. And the whole Nixon strategy with television was built around realizing what his weaknesses were and then playing to his strengths. Hillary could come across as a serious, hardworking, practical person if she would relax, but she wants to overreach. She wants us to believe she's all these things she's not.KELLY: Uh-hm. And it's fine to be -- you know she's a former First Lady, Secretary, so we know somebody else has been driving her. That's fine. That's a nice life. Most of us would like to lead that life. We're not going to hold it against her if she doesn't go on the subway.GINGRICH: If I can charge as much for speeches as she was charging, I wouldn't feel like he needs the subway very often.KELLY: Right. By the way, Roger Ailes said similar things to me, not the part about being unlikable but he also said that stuff to me about your authentic self on television.(CROSSTALK)GINGRICH: I want to reassure you, you're much more likable than Richard Nixon was.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: Thank you. Mr. Speaker, great to see you.GINGRICH: Thanks.KELLY: Well, some folks in the Bronx today shared a New York welcome for Senator Ted Cruz.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an immigrant community, Ted Cruz!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Immigrant community, Ted!(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Charles Krauthammer joins us next on that, and what's next in this Republican race. Plus --(CROWD CHANTING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)The Obama administration is now arguing to give a whole list of benefits to the illegal immigrants known as dreamers. We'll look at whether the Supreme Court is going to sign off.And then -- new fallout tonight after former President Bill Clinton gets into a shouting match with the Black Lives Matter Movement. A hot KELLY FILE still ahead. Don't go away.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, D,, 42ND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You are defending the people who kill the lives that you say matter. Tell the truth.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you know this is an immigrant community?SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm thrilled to be here.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you get your Bronx visa? You're not allowed in the Bronx.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We love you, Cruz. God bless you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Get out of the Bronx.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an immigrant community, Ted Cruz!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's an immigrant community.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) but you are not welcome here. We're at the forefront of climate change, Ted Cruz. We're at the forefront of climate change here.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: So we're putting him down as a maybe. Breaking tonight from the campaign trail, Senator Ted Cruz gets a rather rough welcome from the big apple as he begins campaigning in New York. You heard those folks in the Bronx, and also from Mr. Trump, who wanted to remind folks about Ted Cruz and New York values. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You know, lying Ted Cruz came today. He couldn't draw 100 people. Do you remember during the debate, when he started lecturing me on New York values, like we're no good? And I've got this guy standing over there looking at me, talking about New York values, with scorn on his face, with hatred, with hatred of New York. So folks, I think you can forget about him.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Charles Krauthammer, FOX News contributor and author of the book, ""Things That Matter"" now out in paperback. Charles, good to see you. And so, first of all, New Yorkers are just so colorful. I mean, they put it all out there. You know, there's no ambiguity about how they feel about you, which is something we always love about them. And it doesn't seem like they're feeling the Cruz train right now.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No. I think that's the definition of a Bronx cheer, the reception he got in the Bronx. And I think what he ought to do is to examine -- to look at his advance team and to find the guy who picked that venue. It wasn't exactly very wise. Look, it was a fairly uncivil reception he got. But it's New York. It's loud. And it's allowed. That's called free speech. It was not -- the problem with Cruz is, he's coming off the Wisconsin win and the definition of momentum is to keep it going. And I think it kind of stop right in its tracks today in the Bronx, and with the Trump speech about New York values.KELLY: Uh-hm. And now, you know, Ted Cruz is basically saying, you forget about that stuff. I was really just talking about the really Liberal politicians.KRAUTHAMMER: Look, I think he made -- what he did in that debate months ago was a classic case of what you would call a gaffe with a long fuse. There was a dozen ways in which he could have made that charge against Trump without using the adjective ""New York."" Of course, it didn't hurt him in Iowa. I don't think it helped him in any way. But it was a huge mistake, because one day he was going to end up in New York. Look, there is no way around that gaffe. He can try to explain it saying, well, I was talking about the politicians. But that's just not going to work. In fact, what he did in that debate is by saying New York values, he served up for Trump the opportunity for his strongest response in any of the 11 debates.KELLY: Uh-hm. These guys were probably not thinking at the time that New York was going to be relevant in this race.KRAUTHAMMER: Exactly.KELLY: But now it is very much. So, let me as you about that.KRAUTHAMMER: Yes.KELLY: Because even if Trump gets over 50 percent in New York state, he doesn't necessarily win all the delegates here. You have to win each Congressional district, as well. So Ted Cruz could pick some off. And it looks right now, like even if Trump has a great result in New York and he's posed to with over 30 points in his favor, we're still likely headed for a contested convention. So with what we just talked about with Newt Gingrich, about you know, Donald Trump has 69 and the American public having very unfavorable opinions of him. Ted Cruz at 59 percent, very unfavorable. How do you see this shaping up?KRAUTHAMMER: I think the best analysis right now would be to say that Trump has to win on the first ballot, that he's likely to be denied the nomination if it goes to multiple ballots. Because he will only get weaker as the candidates -- as the delegates are released from their obligations. I still think he has a reasonable chance to win on the first ballot. I would assume that if he got close, within 50 or so, it would be like giving somebody a three-foot putt. And it would be a way to garner a view of the uncommitted delegates.But if he's, you know, 100 away or more, and most importantly, if Cruz comes reasonably close, say 200 delegates behind, so it's not a huge gap. It's not like the gap between them and Kasich, then I think Cruz has a claim to legitimacy. After all, if neither gets the majority, if they both have a large plurality with Trump perhaps ahead but not prohibitively so, then I think each has a chance. Trump has to win, I think, on the first ballot.KELLY: What do you make of these general election polls that show Trump versus Hillary, she's beating him in most of the polls by ten points. She's also beating Cruz by about three points. Kasich is beating her, but he's so far behind, I don't know that's relevant. The Cruz and the Trump people both say just let me at her. Just once it's just me and her, don't worry, those numbers are going to flip.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, they could. I mean, historically the numbers five months away, I think we are from the election, even longer, they will change dramatically. Reagan was way behind Carter in 1980 because these things can change. The problem is that these candidates are very well known. Certainly Trump. Certainly Clinton. Cruz a bit less so. So that it isn't as if people haven't heard of them, having formed an opinion. The opinion is formed. So, I think these perceptions are going to be much harder to change than in the regular normal cycle.KELLY: Even with Trump coming out with a series of policy speeches and, you know, we're hearing maybe sort of walking on a little bit more of a straight and narrow path.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, no. I think that would definitely help him. But I do think it would require -- it's got to be sort of a character change, a persona change. Look, what got him here is his style. When you look at the exit polls from the Republicans who support him, tell it like it is, leadership, strength, all this stuff. But it's part of his whole shtick. Now, if he's going to change, I can be presidential overnight, that would make a difference. But you wonder whether that's going to be seen as authentic.KELLY: Uh-hm.KRAUTHAMMER: The speeches will help. He needs to put flesh on the bone. But people are going to ask themselves, is this really what he thinks or is he reading a speech that somebody else read? Because when you get him unawares, like in the question about abortion, he demonstrated as of now, at age 69, he apparently had never thought through the question of what do you do if it's illegal.KELLY: To your point about, you know, he has to sort of change character. Rudy Giuliani came out today and said, he's going to vote for Trump and he supports him but he says it's not an endorsement but I'm going to vote for him. So, the man I know is not the man you see on television. He's a gentleman. He's a good father. Charles, good to see you.KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure.KELLY: Up next, the college student being asked to give up an important campus gig all because she dared to support Donald Trump with chalk.Plus, new fallout after Hillary Clinton is caught in a subway snafu with a ticket, well, metrocard at least that would not work. And then President Obama trying to convince the U.S. Supreme Court to give government benefits to the illegal immigrants in the country known as Dreamers. We'll going to take a look at whether this is going to work, just ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER: From the World Headquarters of FOX News, it's THE KELLY FILE with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: From our cupcake nation file tonight, a classic. A group of students at the University of Tennessee now demanding the resignation of a student leader. What did she do? She expressed support for Donald Trump. Haley Puckett was popular enough to be elected to the student Senate. But that was before she sent out the offending tweet about the pro-Trump chalk drawings she actually helped create at her school, saying she was actually proud of the work being done be by her fellow Trump supporters. And now her fellow student leaders are letting her have it, calling for her to step down because she does not agree with them and their politics! Pro-Trump chalkings, similarly offended some of the cupcakes over at Emory University.Chalk drawings, folks, and cupcakes with no understanding of the free speech principles on which this country was founded. Welcome to 2016. So the man credited for helping President George W. Bush win the White House today penned a new column for the Wall Street Journal on the road ahead in this Republican race.And joining me now with his magic white board, FOX News contributor and former deputy-chief-of-staff to President George W. Bush, Karl Rove. Karl, good to see you.So, you're sort of outlining what you gleaned from Wisconsin. And can you tell us that in light of what we're also seeing now is likely to happen in New York?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, look, after Wisconsin, Donald Trump has 743 delegates, and the not Trump, that's Kasich and Rubio and Cruz and un-committeds, and the miscellaneous delegates left in the hands of others, they total 897. So there's 154 gap, delegate gap between where Trump is and where not Trump is. And I think Charles Krauthammer hit it right. Trump needs to win on the first ballot. Otherwise he's going to start losing delegates. So far he's done -- his operation has not done an ineffectual job of making sure at the second half of the process, first half of the process is a portion of the delegates through primaries and caucuses.Second half of it is, actually getting the delegates elected at state conventions and district conventions. He done good on the first, 37 percent of the vote, 743 delegates, he's not done good on the second one. As a result, there are people who are today bound to Trump on the first or second ballot who are not going to be supporters of his after they're unbound.KELLY: Uh-hm.ROVE: So, he has to go in with -- he has a 154 delegate deficit right now. He's going to close up a bunch of that in New York. Some estimates are, that he will get 90 or 95, 90 out of 95, I'm not sure that it's going to be that big given where the Congressional districts are apportioned. In each district, if somebody gets 50 percent, they get all three, if they get less than 50 percent and somebody else gets more than 20, and it goes two to one. And I think we're going to see some districts where Cruz and Kasich primarily Kasich are going to do better. But even if he gets all 95, that still means that he's about 60 delegates behind the not Trump forces. And he's got a lot of rough territory ahead.KELLY: But this guy, Paul Manafort that he just hired who seems to be very well respected, he knows what he's doing. Isn't his job now to shore up those delegates to say, you vote Trump, you stick with Trump, even if he get freed up and you become unbound, you need to stick with him.ROVE: Yeah. Well, look, we have elected -- call it 2,400-somewhat delegates to the national convention, we have 832 left to select, to apportion out through primaries and caucuses. We've got probably about 1,200 yet to vote on and just select in state party conventions and district conventions. And it's awfully late. Paul Manafort is excellent. He did this in 1976 for Gerald Ford against Ronald Reagan under the direction of a young Houston lawyer named James A. Baker III. You may have heard of him later in life. But it's awful late, and you need to have in place the infrastructure to actually make this happen. And all along, Donald Trump has not built the infrastructure inside.KELLY:  I want to ask you about something else in your piece, where you talked about look, you said he -- his temperament, Trump's temperament has something to do why he lost Wisconsin and could cost him the nomination. And the question is if that's true, if Wisconsin was some harbinger of things to come, why is he killing it in New York? Why does he still have solid poll numbers in virtually all the states that are coming up between now and June 7th?ROVE: Well, look, it's his home state. He better do well there. But look, he goes into Wisconsin and takes on the very popular Republican governor, and says things that people in Wisconsin absolutely know are not true about him.KELLY:  My question is, that's an aberration. Unless he does that in every other state.(CROSSTALK)ROVE: Well, maybe. But remember, the real clear politics average going into Wisconsin was 39-35, Cruz in front. But a close race. It ended up being 48-35, a 13-point blowout. I think it was because as we grounded in, people sort of said, wait a minute, you're saying and doing things we don't think demonstrate what we want to see in the presidential. Then he compounds it on election night with a concession statement that is jaw- droppingly dumb. He basically accuses his opponent explicitly of violating federal law, and makes a series of outrageous statements that -- I think Newt Gingrich had it right. That was the moment to be gracious. That was the moment to look like a president, not the moment to look like an angry, bitter, and resentful loser. And that's what he came off as.KELLY:  Karl Rove, thank you.ROVE: You bet. Thank you.KELLY: Joining us now with a reaction, former Republican presidential candidate and Donald Trump supporter, endorser, Dr. Ben Carson. Good to see you, Dr. Carson. What do you make of that? Do you think Trump's detractors are making too much out of the snarky statement he put out on the night of the Wisconsin loss?BEN CARSON, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, obviously they're going to make a lot of it, you know, people are going to be defending on who they're supporting, they're going see everything in either a negative or positive light. That's really the problem. Because the Republicans, the conservatives, the people who think logically, have to recognize that the stakes here are extraordinarily high. And they have to stop creating this tension between them, so that people are going to say, I'm not voting for that person no matter what.KELLY:  But it's the nature of the primary process. I mean, you know how -- it's just so ugly between the candidates right now. You know, you were once opposed to Donald Trump and he came after you and that -- isn't that just the nature of the process? You can't stop that.CARSON: It would be nice if we stop it and if we could be mature.KELLY: Well, we can't.CARSON: It seems like we can't. I know that we can, though. I know we have the intellectual ability to do it and to focus on the things that are important. And I think we have to keep trying to do that.KELLY: What do you think -- when you were still in this race, one of the things you always did very well on was likability, and honestly and trustworthiness. Is it possible to advise somebody on how to raise their likability, their favorables? How would you suggest that be done?CARSON: Well, first of all, it is interesting, I did have high favorables. People liked me, but they didn't vote for me. And Trump has horrible numbers, but they vote for him.(LAUGHTER)CARSON: I don't know that there's a great correlation there.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Maybe he shouldn't listen to you. That's one of the things -- one of the core things. Because Corey Lewandowski, his campaign manager, has said to have put on the board, Let Trump Be Trump, that is the way forward for him. Don't have outside people who think they know better coming in to massage this candidate who doesn't look anything like any other candidate. And because he's so unlike anything we've ever seen, he's gotten to this place in the race.CARSON: Well, I think you need the outside people though. There's no question that he has to up the ground game. He's got to cultivate the delegates. If you don't play that part of the game, you're going to lose100 percent of the time. So that was the right move to make.KELLY: Do you think that's stealing -- some people say that's stealing the vote, but the other argument is well, those delegates are unbound, when they switch, if they switch, it's only at a point at which by the rules, they become unbound.CARSON: Yes. The rules are the rules. But, you know, again, I can't emphasize strongly enough, we're about to go over the cliff. We may not be able to get back. If we get a progressive in there and they get two to four Supreme Court picks, America as we know it is gone. That's what people have to think about. So the Cruz supporters need to say I'm going to support Trump if he wins. Trump supporters need to say I will support Cruz if he wins. Whoever the person is, they have to support them. You have got to put aside your own little petty things and recognize we're talking about the future of this country. We're talking about our children and grandchildren. We somehow have got to get that through people's heads.KELLY:  Great to see you, Dr. Carson. Thanks for being here.CARSON: You, too. Thanks, Megyn.KELLY:  Some dramatic moments on the campaign trail today when Bill Clinton runs into a buzzsaw of protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement, and wow! He was not happy. Is this going to be a problem for the Clinton campaign? Surrogates from both the Sanders and the Clinton camp, they're getting along now fine but we'll see in five minutes. Stay tuned.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BERNIE SANDERS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter. Tell the truth!(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Hillary Clinton traveled like a true New Yorker today, sort of, when the Democratic presidential candidate was caught on camera making several failed attempts to properly swipe her MetroCard. In her defense, she may have swiped it just right, and it just didn't go through. This has happened to all of us. It eventually went through and she managed to take the train for one full stop, with a full security details and a bunch of cameras, all through her campaign. That's just how we all do it. Trace Gallagher is live in our West Coast Newsroom with one of those moments. Hey, Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Just so you know, Megyn, a few years ago, the New York Daily News reported that 80 percent of all MetroCard swipes at New York City subways are successful. And the primary reason the other 20 percent fail is because the ticket is damaged or defective. Hillary Clinton's Metro Card was neither. Yet, it took her about five swipes to make it, which took some credibility away from her statement claiming she loves the subway and that it's the best way to get around. Her lack of knowledge on the proper swipe technique also took a bit of the sting away from her slam at Bernie Sanders, when he proved he, too, does not hang with the strap hangers. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you ride the subway today?SANDERS: You get a token and you get in.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wrong.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Wrong. The token was were replaced by the Metro Card some 13 years ago or as Hillary Clinton pointed out during her time, as a New York senator. And while the media is covering the subway snafus, it's doing so in a lighthearted way. But think back 24 years when George H.W. Bush seemed surprised by the technology of grocery store scanners. And the New York Times portrayed him as being out of touch with average citizens, saying quote, 'some grocery stores began using electronic scanners as early as 1976. And the devices have been in general use in American supermarkets for a decade.' The Times was later criticized for exaggerating Bush's lack of scanner knowledge, but at the time he, was battling Bill Clinton and the recession, and the criticism had a lasting impact on the campaign. Megyn.KELLY: I'm glad we've gotten to the bottom of that. Trace, thank you. Five swipes he tells us, five. Hillary was not the only one facing critics today. Earlier this evening, her husband, the former president, had a furious exchange -- furiously anger with a couple of Black Lives Matter protesters. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. Now, you're screaming. So let's do another one. Whoa, whoa, whoa!(CROWD CHANTING)CLINTON: Come on. Wait, wait, wait. See these other signs? This is what's the matter. I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and send them out on the street to murder other African-American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn't. She didn't. You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter. Tell the truth.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now is a Bernie Sanders supporter Nomiki Konst, and Hillary Clinton supporter, Melissa Mark-Viverito. She is also the New York City council speaker. Thank you both so much for being here.NOMIKI KONST, ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT: Thank you for having me.KELLY: Oh, my goodness. In Hillary's defense, how many times have you swiped it properly and nothing?KONST: It happens.KELLY: I don't think we can indict the swiping.KONST: It's the angle.KELLY: And sometimes if you don't use it for a couple of weeks, then it doesn't work at all. You got to go back, you got to reactivate. She just doesn't live here. Well, she's campaigning. In any event, now that we put swipe-gate to the side.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: I will ask you about the Bill Clinton exchange there. That is a real issue that's going to come back to haunt Hillary. And tell us what it is, Nomiki.KONST: Well, the issue is that Bill Clinton senses the presidency might be slipping away from Hillary Clinton, and it also wreaks of desperation for him to hold on to his legacy.KELLY: But explain the fight that they were having. It was over something Hillary Clinton said that black youth -- that they're super predators back in 1996, he had a speech 20 years ago about violent crime.MELISSA MARK-VIVERITO, NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL SPEAKER: This is about the Crime Bill, which Hillary Clinton acknowledges at this point was a mistake. She has a very comprehensive platform to talk about criminal justice reform comprehensively in this country. She's the only candidate that has vocally and consistently talks about systemic racism.(CROSSTALK)KONST: That's not true.KELLY: The Black Lives Matter, they are holding that speech against her, and the Crime Bill.MARK-VIVERITO: And it's a Crime Bill Bernie Sanders voted for.(CROSSTALK)MARK-VIVERITO: So the issue here is, which candidate has the most comprehensive approach to really dealing with the systemic issues that are disproportionally affecting communities of color.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: They were saying to her that she basically put a bunch of African- Americans in jail.Oct2MARK-VIVERITO: One in four African-Americans.KELLY: But they believe the Crime Bill did.(CROSSTALK)MARK-VIVERITO: Bernie Sanders voted for it.KONST: He voted for that. Let's be clear about that.(CROSSTALK)KONST: You understand legislation. You understand it. You understand you have to attach two bills. Other things, the Violence Against Woman Act was attached to that Crime Bill. Every Democrat voted for that Crime Bill, because the Clintons were triangulating. That's how legislation works.(CROSSTALK)MARK-VIVERITO: What we need to look at is what is the platform? Where is the plan of action that these candidates are presenting?KELLY:  I agree, but I'm focused on why they are holding this against her and whether this is going to be an issue.(CROSSTALK)MARK-VIVERITO: I think this is an issue that's been approached with all candidates, not just Hillary Clinton. And so, again, the way that you come and confront that is by what is your plan of action?(CROSSTALK)KONST: That's not true. When your rhetoric.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Bill Clinton, you know, he was irritated there, that was obvious. And he feels that his Crime Bill is being misrepresented and he went on to say, look, there are gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out in the streets to murder other African-Americans. Maybe you thought they were good citizens, but I did not. And that's where super predator came from.(CROSSTALK)KONST: He's generalizing an entire African-American community where one in four African-Americans is in prison. Let me make this very clear. They were in prison because this Crime Bill was lobbied by the private prison industry, which he accepted money from and Hillary Clinton continues to. So what Bernie Sanders is doing right now, and what Black Lives Matter is doing right now is they're connecting the dots.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Let her finish.KONST: Voters are smart. They understand that there's $5.5 billion in private prison stock rising because people are making money off of putting people in jail. Unfortunately, it's been targeting the African-American community, and it was the result of '90s legislation.MARK-VIVERITO: So I am a speaker at the New York City council, I am a Latina who has been living in New York City since 1987. And Hillary Clinton has a relationship not only with the Latina community, with the African-American community that goes back 20 years. This is not a new relationship. She's not learning these issues. She's not just talking.(CROSSTALK)MARK-VIVERITO: If I may, having been our senator in the state of New York, I understand firsthand what her platform is. We understand. The district I represent here in New York City is a community that has been disproportionally impacted by criminal justice systems which she will look to address at a systemic level and nationwide.KELLY: The polls in New York on the Democratic side have tightened a bit. It's not the landslide or the lopsided thing that we're seeing for Trump and Cruz for Hillary and Bernie. Do you think there is any chance she loses New York to Bernie?MARK-VIVERITO: Not at all. I know that the relationship she's had with the state runs deep.(CROSSTALK)KONST: It's called patronage.(CROSSTALK)KONST: She's a U.S. Senator. She walked into New York, she cut deals the way Bill Clinton did. Everybody knows what New York is about. There's machine politics at the local level and she's been able to oil that machine. Bernie Sanders is funding his campaign on $27 donations. What his movement is about not about patronage. He's bringing in independents, he's bringing in first-time voters.KELLY: OK.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Got to leave it at that. I've got to run. Also tonight, what's going to happen with illegal immigrants and benefits? That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: A developing controversy over an argument the Obama White House plans on presenting to the U.S. Supreme Court. As the administration prepares to make the case, that some folks in this country illegally are entitled to benefits like Medicare and Social Security, thanks to President Obama's executive order on immigration. Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen has more. James.JAMES ROSEN, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, good evening. The momentous issues in the case of U.S. v. Texas set for Supreme Court oral arguments about 10 days from now involve the limits of presidential power,26 states are challenging the executive orders President Obama signed in late 2014 unilaterally expanding the number of illegal aliens and their family members up to 4 million of them in all, who can be shielded from deportation under a policy called Deferred Action. Receiving little attention until now, however, is a startling assertion tucked away in the Obama administration's court filings namely that these protected foreigners known as nonqualified aliens can receive some of the same federal benefits U.S. citizens enjoy.In a Supreme Court brief filed last month, Mr. Obama's solicitor general, Donald Verrilli argued, a nonqualified alien is not categorically barred from participating in certain federal earned benefit programs associated with lawfully working in the United States, the Social Security retirement and disability, Medicare, Railroad Worker programs, so long as the alien is lawfully present in the United States as determined by the Homeland Security Secretary.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN MALCOLM, Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies: All of a sudden, the people who are here illegally, they wake up every day continuing to violate our nation's immigration laws are being afforded in many cases, more benefits than lawful citizens get.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: At the time, the president promised his orders will not confer federal benefits on these undocumented workers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It does not grant citizenship or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive, only Congress can do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: If supporters of the president's immigration policy say that benefits do not mark new legal ground.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ELIZABETH WYDRA, CONSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY CENTER: It's the president's decision to defer removal. And then after that, it's really what Congress has passed that kicks in to determine whether people here with that deferred action then get certain benefits or work authorization.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: The vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia complicates the process of how the how the high court will rule. A decision is expected by late June or early July. Megyn.KELLY: James, thank you.An important thought after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: April is National Child Abuse Prevention month. Nearly five children die every single day in this country due to abuse and neglect. Every 10 seconds, a report is made that a hide is being abused. Millions of children are at risk and it's too easy to look away. If you know someone in need, please call the National Child Abuse hotline at 1-800- 4achild.
