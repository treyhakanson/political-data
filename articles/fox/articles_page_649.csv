"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 23, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 O'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""In just under three hours from now, Nevada republicans will begin the process of deciding who they want to be their party's nominee. The GOP caucuses start at 8:00 p.m. eastern, 30 delegates are at stake. The polls of Trump on the cause of third straight win. Last night, he sat down for an hour with Sean Hannity, and addressed concerns among some of the right that he is not conservative enough to be the republican nominee.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Ronald Reagan was a liberal -- pretty liberal democrat and he evolved into a fairly -- can say, he was the most conservative president, but he evolved into a republican who was fairly conservative. I will say this. I think that I have very much evolved, but if you look at my real conservative credentials, and I don't think the words that are important. You know, they say, ""he is not a true conservative."" I know Jeb and others were saying, ""He is not a true conservative.""(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Because, you know, and that's when I came up in about two weeks ago, I said I'm a common sense conservative.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Rubio and Cruz are determined to break Trump's winning streak tonight. Here's Rubio.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we nominate someone that half of the Republican Party hates, we're going to be fighting against each other all the way until November. We will never win that way. We can't -- I don't care how much you may think they're funny or how interesting they may sound, if we nominate someone that 40 to 50 percent of our party doesn't can't stand, we are going to lose.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So politics, especially presidential politics, this stage of the game and the race are about two things; momentum and time. Trump has the momentum, and time is running out for Cruz and Rubio, and here's why. The magic number to clinch is 1237. Here's where the candidates stand. So far, you can see it on the screen right now. But here's how the delegate count breaks down going forward. Super Tuesday awards 621 delegates, the following weekend of the 356 delegates. And then, the big date, March 15th, winner take all states, mostly. And also Florida and Ohio, winner takes all states, 367 more delegates that day for a grand total of 1344 delegates. Bitter medicine, but if Cruz and/or Rubio want to make a serious run at president, one has to drop out before Super Tuesday or the path is paved for the frontrunner who leads most of the polls of the upcoming states. Now that part is my opinion right there. KG, if they continue to be a three-man race, the ones that aren't Donald Trump are going to be splitting a vote. Now splitting it pretty evenly, will it makes sense for one of them to step aside now?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: This not gonna happen, especially with those three. And you've got, you know, five people still in it. I mean, Carson and Kasich are still in it. They're not showing any signs of dropping out. They want to be in it for the long haul, at least they are saying that. Let's see what happens, you know, after today. But I think everybody's got too much invested that still in the game, especially the first, you know, the top three. Trump, for all intents and purposes, it looks like he's going to run away with this, tonight. The question is to become, who's gonna be in second?BOLLING: Yeah, what do you think about the --JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Let me question your premise.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Let me question your premise. Because your question suggested, if one of them dropped out, then they could consolidate the vote.GUILFOYLE: Coalesce.WILLIAMS: . the anti-trump vote.BOLLING: Actually, the premise is that everyone drops out, whether it's Cruz or Rubio, one of those to drop out. Kasich and Carson, drop out as well.WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Right.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Right, so you consolidate the anti-Trump forces.BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: . in the party. And what we're seeing so far is much of that already going to Rubio. We've seen a spate of endorsements recently, most recently in Nevada today. Dean Heller, the senator going through Rubio. But we've also seen people like Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota. Bob Dole, the former senator, former presidential candidate.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: The establishment is all going to Rubio. But again, the premises; if those to -- if they were to drop out order join forces, they could beat Trump. But I'm just not convinced.BOLLING: I think joined forces.WILLIAMS: . that a lot of those people --BOLLING: . the one has to step aside.WILLIAMS: Yeah --BOLLING: That's the other one being --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: That means they're joining forces. But I still don't think that everybody would automatically go against Trump. I think some of those people would go to Trump.BOLLING: Dana, your thoughts on whether, either one would do it and/or should do it?PERINO: Well, I actually think that my opinion on that doesn't matter, because they're not dropping out before next Tuesday. So, and the other thing that's interesting in this race is that, remember, there's so much (inaudible) about how much money was involved in politics, and especially on the democratic side. So upset about the citizen's united decision by the Supreme Court that allowed for Super PAC and for corporations to be able to exercise their First Amendment rights, because then they were -- there would be so much money in politics. And what we found is that, actually, that's -- it doesn't matter if you're Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush, and you've got all the money. This is a very disruptive campaign, but there are new technologies. Donald Trump, a self-funning billionaire, doesn't have to spend hardly any money at all, because he's figured out the social media piece of it. So I don't think that any of them are gonna drop out, because they don't need to, because they have enough money to keep going.BOLLING: And one more thought, March 15th, with both Ohio and Florida, winner take all states. Can you imagine -- I mean, look, if you really want to make the run against Trump, if he beats the two with Ohio and the Ohio governor and the senator from Florida in their own states, I mean --GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: That's where they have to get that aggressive. It's gonna be -- just can't. If somebody is not dropping out and somebody has to get aggressive and start addressing specifics.I just want to talk about what Trump said last night. I watched the Hannity event -- what a blood bath. It was amazing. I don't know how Donald Trump got out of that alive. I was watching it through my fingers. It was -- seriously, just scary. Actually, Sean would -- did a great job. He is nice to every candidate and he offers an hour to each one. It just so happens this is before the caucus, and Ronald Reagan. The point about Ronald Reagan, he was governor in 1967, 13 years before he became president. So he was a strong conservative for quite a while. We knew what that package was. He was republican twice. And he had run for president best ran for president in 1980. So this is a bit different.The other thing too, is when you're talking about who is conservative and who isn't, it may not be important because ideology isn't important at this point. People are looking for strength or for principles. However, one does have to point out that a conservative is not for bailouts, you know, bank bailouts or card -- or auto-bailouts. It's not for eminent domain for parking lots. It's not for terrorists. It's not for trade wars or protectionism. It doesn't create straw man about mandates. If you're not for a mandate, you want people to die in the streets.Conservative might touch entitlements. Trump won't touch that. A conservative is also, is a champion of temperament. You are a conservative. You favor the known over the unknown. The good news about this whole thing is that Trump is not an ideologue. He is not a conservative. He is not a liberal. He is not anything. What he does like is he likes to be liked. And if he does become president and he looks at the polls and he changes his mind on certain things; that is going to make him more likable. He's not -- he may not build that wall. The things that everybody scared of may not happen because the secret to Trump is he likes being liked.BOLLING: OK. Let's do this. Ted Cruz's opponents have accused him of dirty tricks this election, but he maintains he is not the one who is the bad guy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a very strange dynamic where two of the candidates in this race, Donald Trump and Marco Rubio. Whenever anyone points to their actual record, they won't defend their record. They won't even discuss their record they just scream liar, liar, liar. And both of them have been engaging in very nasty, very personal attacks relentlessly and daily. And it is all false.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: OK. What do you say Greg?GUTFELD: I -- well, I -- it's hard to take Cruz seriously because he has bear hugged Trump for months. He did not go after Trump at all. He was Trump's close friend. So now when he's coming out and he's talking -- and he's trying defend himself, it rings false. And it reminds, Juan, that Cruz has been an opportunist.WILLIAMS: True.GUTFELD: In many cases, in the Senate. He always looks for the most attention seeking maneuver -- you know, I think he is in trouble.BOLLING: But let me also point out, Dana, that he is a great constitutional conservative, he argued in front of the Supreme Court, on behalf of the state of Texas for five years; very successfully as well.PERINO: Extremely. And so, I think again, as we go back to remember that there were 17 candidates, just even, just a few months ago. And now we only have five. But there was -- out of those 17, there were several very qualified people and I put Ted Cruz in that camp. I think one of the things for him is I heard (inaudible) in last night on Special Report that he was being pinched from both sides, because both -- Trump and Rubio were hitting him for the same issue. And so then he had to fire his communications director and that became a new story and kind of got them off their game a little bit.BOLLING: And he -- when he represented the United States, Texas and 31 states in the Heller decision.PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: The Second Amendment defense.WILLIAMS: Right. But I don't know that that makes him such an attractive candidate. The problem is, look, he is saying Trump is not a conservative. We heard earlier, Trump say, ""I am a common sense conservative."" But you hear from Cruz, ""hey, you know what? Remember abortion. Trump has been back and forth."" They say, you know, you talk about eminent domain, Greg. Trump -- is that a really a conservative position? So I think Cruz sees his whole right now with the evangelicals, maybe in like, tonight, in the rural parts of Nevada. But I don't see him coming through here. He has got to convince some people who are now behind Trump, that really Trump is a fake. Trump is nothing but a, you know, a blind trust that you're putting your trust into Trump and his anger and his willingness to say anything. But is he a republican? Is he a conservative?BOLLING: Don't trust Trump, trust Jeb.GUILFOYLE: Guess what, that's not gonna even work. Trusted, I mean, a good sign, but that doesn't gonna even work. The people that are supporting Trump, because they want somebody who is like a doer, whose gonna get in there. Who is not afraid to get their hands dirty, and like, you know, kick butt, right? That's what they want. It's like bad attitude and willingness to get after stuff and do it. And then obviously, caring less about specific conservative like line item, you know issues.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Can I bring up a line item issue right now? That's been the dividing line between Cruz and Rubio; straight through. They've been going at it on immigration throughout the election. Last night both burned up their platforms on the O'Reilly Factor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: Yes, we should deport them. We should build a wall, we should triple the border patrol, and federal law requires that anyone here illegally that's apprehended should be deported. That's what I suggest for. We have law enforcement that looks for people, who are violating the laws.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Both Donald Trump and Marco Rubio would allow those 12 million people to become U.S. citizens.RUBIO: The ones that are dangerous criminals. The ones that are violent, the one who oppose a threat would have mean, immediately deported. And many others would have to be deported because they don't qualify. They've been here long enough. What we do with the rest of them is not something we'll have a debate about until we first secure or border.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So Dana, do you want to take this one?PERINO: Yes.BOLLING: This is a rough one to --PERINO: I feel like immigration is -- everybody is a little bit all over the map. They want a little of everything, and they trying to be all things to all people. But remember in that South Carolina vote, just on Saturday - - three days ago? In the exit polls, 54 percent of people polled in South Carolina. Republicans said that they were for a path to citizenship for people who are here illegally. To me is that, it means that this whole debate, that the cable news and the newspapers focus and these two fight amongst each other all the time on this that they're kind of missing the boat, that a comprehensive approach is a good one.I also saw Ace of Base today make a very good point. If you say you are going to deport, it doesn't necessarily mean physically picking somebody up by the scruff of their neck and throwing them on the bus and getting them out of here, even though that is some imagery that people would might like to use.The threat of deportation, the worry that you might be deported or a decline in welfare benefits for people who are here illegally, will discourage people from coming in the first place. So there is a school of thought that I think Ted Cruz didn't quite hit the mark last night, but that is, I think the direction he was headed.WILLIAMS: But I think, Dana, the key here to understand is that Ted Cruz is trying to appeal to that hard core conservative base that he feels is somewhat distracted by Donald Trump. It's not only that he lost the evangelical vote to Trump, but that he is splitting people who say, I am self-identified as a true conservative. So he is trying to make the case, but I think he does it in practical terms. I don't think, to people like you, the rest us, I suspect people think we're really going to round up 12 million people and throw them out? Is that practical? Can we really do that? He said, ""Oh, yeah. We can do it. We have law enforcement that will do it."" I just think that most folks, when they look at that don't believe it.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Well, that's what I said there was a majority of 54 percent of people in South Carolina --WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: . republican voters said they were not for that.WILLIAMS: Right.GUTFELD: The way Sanders is pulling Hillary to the left on progressive politics and the politics of inequality Trump has pulled the field to the anti-immigration point. But the irony of it is Trump might end up being, when he calls himself a sensitive conservative, less fiery about this than you actually think.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Can I give last, final thoughts. The conservative moment is concerned with Rubio at one point being part of the gang of eight which provided the path way to citizenship. And now, he is saying he doesn't want it. But look, I'm in the camp that says where are you now? What do you promise to do when you're a president, rather than what you talked about four, five years ago?GUILFOYLE: Well, meaning go on the record. Tell us exactly what you stand for, so we can sit there and have columns and click down and say, OK, this is their position is on immigration or on taxes or on the IRS or any of these host of issues; National security, the military. It's important because now this is getting really fine tuned. So yes, I'm interested in what you have to say today and what commitment you're willing to make.BOLLING: All right. We're going to leave it right there. Stay tuned because there's much more to come on this republican caucus day in Nevada; Kasich and Carson are still vowing to stay in the race despite the odds against them. We'll gonna hear from those two candidates, when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Back now on this Election Day, once again, in Nevada. John Kasich, at this point is an extreme long shot for the nomination. He cannot afford setbacks. But yesterday, he suffered one and quickly tried to recover.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How did I get elected? Nobody was. I didn't have anybody for me. We just got an army of people who -- and many women who left their kitchens to go out and go door to door and to put yard signs up for me, all the way back when, you know, things were different.There is no question, a large part of my career was fueled by women who decided to join the effort and help me to get elected. And, but you know, let's be real about this. You know, my campaign manager is a woman. She used to be my chief of staff. And if I'm president, who knows? She'll have one of the highest positions in the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. So John Kasich obviously campaigned very hard. And people like him. He's got a tremendous amount of experience, but you know, former governor of Ohio, the whole deal. So, that being the case, what do you think about his candidacy and his chances?GUTFELD: He is sensible. He's a Honda civic. But unfortunately, everybody right now wants a Humvee. And, you know, that's the way it is. As for the kitchen remark, everybody, obviously that was just as ridiculous -- it wasn't his problem -- it wasn't anything wrong with it.GUILFOYLE: You don't think this will affect his --GUTFELD: Not at all that -- I mean, he is a good guy. He was a great -- I mean, he got stuff done in Ohio, but I'm sorry, he's just like he is too sensible for this day and age.GUILFOYLE: OK -- Bolling.BOLLING: It's ridiculous. Hillary Clinton tweeted about that comment.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: He did nothing wrong. He said back when I was elected.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: . however many years ago that was, 30 years ago.PERINO: It was in 1978.BOLLING: Yeah, so 30 something years ago. This is what happened. But he clarifies it with, things have changed dramatically. Everyone is working now. You do a phone call to someone's house, no one is --PERINO: Right, because he was -- he explained in 1978.BOLLING: Correct.PERINO: . he would go to people's kitchen --BOLLING: Right.PERINO: Kitchen table and sit down and talk about kitchen table issues about the working class, so --BOLLING: Unfair.PERINO: Unfair but --BOLLING: . on her part -- especially.PERINO: Oh, and you know that the democrats are gonna glob on to anything which is.WILLIAMS: Well, let me just tell you --PERINO: All republican is to beware.WILLIAMS: I happen -- this is an odd one. I happen to agree with you guys. But let me say, I don't think it's unfair.PERINO: At this table?WILLIAMS: At, whatever --(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: However you want to describe it. But I must say, at the event, a woman, so I assume a republican woman, stood up and said she didn't like the fact that he said this.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: So I don't think that everybody --PERINO: It is likely Romney said I had binders full of women, and everybody freak out. What he meant was that he had lots of women's --GUTFELD: You know binder.PERINO: . resumes, so that he could figure out if there was any of them would -- that he would want to hire for positions at the big companies.WILLIAMS: Yeah, but I just think, you know what, it's a slip of the tongue. And I don't think he meant anything by it. I think he's --PERINO: Of course not.WILLIAMS: . an authentic genuine guy. And so I just -- I mean, I just think it's not fair to pick on. But let me say, in the business of politics where Hillary Clinton wants to point out that she's a woman and that republicans are tough on women's issues, of course she is going to use it.GUILFOYLE: Look, but he obviously has a tremendous resume, unbelievable qualifications, Dana. And you know, eye on the prize. Nobody becomes president unless you take Ohio. So he still kind of, you know, strong standing. Perhaps, maybe not going to get the nomination, but certainly qualified to do so, but VP.PERINO: Look, I think that he -- I don't think anybody running right now today, that is, that tonight is hoping to get a good showing out of Nevada is running for vice president. These are all running for president. And they all say that they have a pass. Even Ben Carson says that he has a pass to the presidency so I don't necessary think that I will say --GUILFOYLE: I don't think he is running for that. I think he wants to be president, but I think he's got to be attractive to a lot of people right now.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Ohio is such an important state for both democrats and republicans. But republicans, it's a must win. And so, having him at the top of the ticket or somewhere around and supportive is really important.BOLLING: Can I just throw this? Ohio, 66 delegates, I mean, we're talking about 1237 we need to win. I just -- and the problem is that the thing is, it is winner take all in Ohio.WILLIAMS: Right.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: So if he drops out before Ohio, someone would get 66 delegates.PERINO: Right.BOLLING: . they probably would need.WILLIAMS: You know, it's funny to me was I saw a poll that said Trump is beating Kasich in Ohio.PERINO: They're up --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Well, Juan, you've done your research. OK, we're going to skip what I was going to say. And at a long shot, Ben Carson, I had that memorized. But thank you, but nevertheless still in the race and doing quick --GUTFELD: Yes. He is like the guy who graduated from high school who is hanging out in the parking lot. It's time to go. And I say that because I like Ben Carson, but you know, you graduated, it move on, write the other book, you know, go on vacation --GUILFOYLE: Save more lives.GUTFELD: Oh yes, exactly. You're a great person.GUILFOYLE: He's amazing.GUTFELD: But you just stop taking money from people, right, because you're not really running.WILLIAMS: Well, he's not getting all a lot of money right now --GUILFOYLE: Well, he's not -- he is not stealing it. People are giving it -- free will.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I know.GUILFOYLE: That's their right, OK.WILLIAMS: The question is without the money, why are you there, you know?GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: What is the purpose? And he says, don't forget, I think he said this last night on the air -- tortoise and the harem, he's coming along.GUILFOYLE: All right. Call your buddy --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: You can't be a tortoise right now. You have to be a hairy hare.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: OK. Are there any others? Next --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: President Obama -- wanted to shut Gitmo since he took office -- remember that? Well today he unveiled his plans and makes it happen. Should the Congress let him? That's ahead. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Today, President Obama announced he's closing Gitmo -- again:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: When it becomes clear that something is not working as intended, when it does not advance our security, we have to change course.The detention facility at Guantanamo Bay does not advance our national security. It undermines it. It is counterproductive to our fight against terrorists, because they use it as propaganda in their efforts to recruit.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: You know when you've become so obsessed with one thing that you ignore everything else? It is the mark of a ""cat lady"": Consumed by felines, she shuns family, hygiene, concerned neighbors.Gitmo is Obama's pile of cats. He is so obsessed by it, his house stinks. And at the expense of our safety, he'd release high-risk heathens, knowing many head right back out to kill. And it's all based on a myth that bad things done to us are caused by mean things we did first, like Gitmo. As a recruitment tool, it breeds terror. So I guess Gitmo caused terrorists to invent a time machine to go back to September 11 and attack us? That's crazy. This must make those Americans working at Gitmo feel great. Your president thinks you cause terror. He also says Gitmo undermines our standing in the world. Sorry, Gitmo didn't do that. For that answer, find a West Wing mirror. He also said Gitmo is pricey -- the first time in history that a leftist cares about your money.But Gitmo shaming give leftists a fake concern without having to judge our enemies -- like say, Cuba. Seriously, of all the bad things in Cuba, what bugs Obama is Gitmo? Forget the four decades of socialist hell, run by murderist leftists, turning every person into a pauper. Yeah, Gitmo is worse. You know Cuba has no freedom of the press. I guess freeing terrorists takes priority. To him, that's closing a chapter on our history. Makes you wonder what book he's been reading.GUTFELD: I don't even know what I'm implying there.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: So Eric, you know what his whole thing as president, it's not working so we need to change course. He has used that for every single argument --BOLLING: Even more egregious is Gitmo undermines our national security. Terrorists use it as a propaganda tool to recruit. Is there any proof at all?GUTFELD: Yeah --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Name one thing. He says, all of -- everyone says --GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: These things -- just give us some proof.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: Next thing -- number, by the numbers. We point out there's what, 95 Gitmo detainees still there, 28.6 percent recidivism, right? That means only about 25 or more rebuild back into the battlefield.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: . and try to kill us again -- great. And the last one, because I love the money. Here's the basis, he said. He said, ""If we close Gitmo, we'll save $85 million a year."" Think about this on two levels. Eighty- five million dollars a year. How much will we spend not to have those people go back into the battle. But that means we're spending $120 million a year on 56 detainees. Because that's what will be left. He's going to release 35. There will be 56 left. A hundred and twenty million dollars per year for 56 -- we're spending $2 million per detainee?GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: And this is what he's worried about? A few bucks? Come on. This is insane. This is all legacy.GUILFOYLE: Yes, but it's just ridiculous. That he's putting his own legacy and ego ahead of national security. Again. And the future of the American people dealing with this. This is ridiculous.Everybody knows the guys that are still left in there, they're amongst the worst, you know, most violent terrorists. And just last week, February 17, you had one of the former bin Laden aides basically crowned as, you know, one of the top terrorists in the world. So good job. Keep on repatriating terrorists in the world and recycling them like dirty laundry.They're coming back out to reoffend again. It's so disrespectful to all the men and women that have served and worked so hard, lost their lives or lost limbs to protect this country and put these guys away, just for our own president to release them.WILLIAMS: And now a moment for another point of view.GUTFELD: Well, wait...WILLIAMS: Let me just say, I was -- go right ahead. Go ahead.GUTFELD: I was just going to -- I was going to come to you. But first, for another point of view, I want to go to President Obama.WILLIAMS: Go right ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Some of the fears of the public that have been fanned oftentimes by misinformation. There continues to be a fair amount of opposition to closing Guantanamo.Even in an election year, we should be able to have an open, honest, good- faith dialogue about how to best ensure our national security. And the fact I'm no longer running, Joe is no longer running, we're not on the ballot, it gives us the capacity to not have to worry about the politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: All right. So Juan, one, a good-faith dialogue means agree with Obama. And that he's not on the ballot is translated, ""I'm going to do whatever I want.""WILLIAMS: No. In fact, he has the option to do what he wants to do through executive action. He has not done so. And not only has he not done so, but I think people in the military and in his old administration said, you know, ""This is not the way to go on this issue.""But I want to respond to Eric, because I think you were wrong on every single point.PERINO: Whoa!WILLIAMS: I think that if you look at what goes on in Guantanamo, and you say what -- Who else agrees with this? What evidence is there of this? I can't tell you how many times military people have said to me, this is a propaganda.BOLLING: There it is. Or Obama comes on the other side...WILLIAMS: Let me just say -- no, no.GUTFELD: I'm not going to tell you.WILLIAMS: And let me just tell you the No. 1, I think, example of this would be a man who was held as a military prisoner, and that's John McCain. A Republican, who said...BOLLING: Can I just ask you...?WILLIAMS: No. Let me -- let me finish my point.BOLLING: All right.WILLIAMS: OK. The second thing to say is, gosh, you know, we have released, I think, the majority of people who were once held at Guantanamo Bay. And you know, the recidivism rate you talk about, how many do you think...BOLLING: Twenty-eight point two.WILLIAMS: ... they're out there recruiting people? There is no shortage of people.BOLLING: Can I just ask you one question, Juan? One question.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: I never interrupted you. But go right ahead.BOLING: Do you think the terrorists are now going to say, if we bring these terror -- these detainees to America in Colorado, terrorism is going to say, ""OK, we're good now. We're all good now. Because Gitmo, we had a problem. We're OK.""GUTFELD: That was the problem. That was the problem.GUILFOYLE: ""Now we like you.""WILLIAMS: No, I think there's something to be said about the idea that we don't hold people indefinitely without charging them.GUTFELD: I think we -- it's a new...WILLIAMS: We don't do this in such a way that just says, ""Oh, you know, we put people in a hellhole and leave them there."" And then say, ""You know what? So what? That's the way we behave.""No. We should not become monsters in this regard. And don't forget, you asked about another person who said Gitmo was a bad idea. How about George W. Bush?GUTFELD: All right.PERINO: Because he didn't want to have to have it, but it was necessary. And it's not a hellhole. Did you see?GUTFELD: It's better than Cuba. Gitmo is better than Cuba!GUILFOYLE: And Venezuela.PERINO: Can I make one serious point, though?GUTFELD: Sure.PERINO: Or did you have a question?GUILFOYLE: There's toilet paper and milk there.GUTFELD: My question is didn't he stop at Gitmo and shake the hands of all the people who work there?PERINO: Don't you think he probably will, and then he'll say, ""By the way, you all get to go home.""GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Here's the thing.GUTFELD: Big beach.PERINO: He said, ""Because I'm not on the ballot, I don't have to worry about the politics.""GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: I'm going to get to that. And he's ignoring the law. Ninety- eight to two, I think it was, something like that, or 97-3 in the United States Senate...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ... said that they, bipartisan agreement, no terrorists will be allowed to be transferred onto U.S. soil.GUILFOYLE: Correct.PERINO: That's the law. Speaker Ryan again reiterated that today. So did...WILLIAMS: This is sheer politics. What about the shoe bomber, the Times Square bomber, the airplane bomber? They're all on U.S. soil, in American prisons, properly convicted. At Guantanamo Bay, no one convicted.BOLLING: They were caught on U.S. soil, Juan.PERINO: Why, why, why? Juan, why did -- why did President Obama stop the military tribunals, then?WILLIAMS: He didn't stop them.PERINO: He did.WILLIAMS: Because they are going nowhere, Dana. They're a waste.PERINO: Grinding to a halt. Let me tell you the other thing on the politics of this. Is that he said he doesn't to have worry about the politics. I think that Hillary Clinton and all the rest of Democrats running in swing states will disagree.In fact, Hillary Clinton already has. In Colorado about four months ago, in doing an interview with local media, she had previously had a position that it would be fine to bring terrorists to the Supermax prison in Colorado. Four months ago, she's like, ""Oh, no, no, no. No, I've changed my position on that. I don't want that.""So he might not think that he has to worry about the politics, but all the other Democrats do. And remember, about 85 percent of Republicans in South Carolina said that they supported the idea, Donald Trump's idea, of the temporary ban on Muslim's coming into the country. I bet that number is probably the case across the country. So if you're at the -- if you're Debbie Wasserman Schultz, you don't like this idea this morning.WILLIAMS: Fifteen years after 9/11, not a single guilty verdict against anyone at Guantanamo Bay.GUTFELD: All right. They're telling me we've got to go. By the way, legacy, it's all about legacy, which would be a great name of a FOX News show. The history of hot legs. Legacy.PERINO: Greg, get out of here.GUILFOYLE: I'm ready!GUTFELD: There you go. Kimberly hosts.New developments in the Democratic race for president. Bernie Sanders picking up some more celebrity endorsements while Hillary Clinton fights to keep her lead in South Carolina ahead of Saturday's vote. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you always told the truth?HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I always try to. I understand that voters have questions: ""Is she in it for us, or is she in it for herself?"" I'm going to demonstrate that I've always been the same person fighting for the same values.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Hillary Clinton is working on her image to prove to voters that she can be trusted. Well, she's got her work cut out for her. According to a new Gallup poll, the first words that come to mind when Americans hear her name: Dishonest, liar, don't trust her, and poor character. The top response for Bernie Sanders, no surprise, socialist.Last night, Republican front-runner Donald Trump said he'd be happy to run against either of them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would love to run against her.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why?TRUMP: She's so badly flawed. First of all, she shouldn't be allowed -- she is. She shouldn't be allowed -- I'd also love to run against a socialist/communist. OK. I don't think -- I don't think our country is ready for communism.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Greg, that Gallup poll, not good for Hillary Clinton. Like how do you overcome that?GUTFELD: Well, here you've got -- you've got a crony who's full of baloney. You've got a senior citizen socialist. So if you're going to -- you have to choose between the two. I will take the liar over the socialist. Because the liar will look out for himself, but the socialist will come after you.All politicians lie, but socialists loot. The problem here is that the socialist is more likable than the liar. Bernie is, you know, a fuzzy adorable socialist Snuggles bear. And that's what's scary. That's why the young people love him.PERINO: Well, the young -- the young people do love him. They haven't, Kimberly, come out for her yet. And I wonder if this reaction by people about when they first think of her, if those are the first words that they -- come to mind. Dishonest, liar, poor character. I mean, that's...GUILFOYLE: That's what happening to Bernie. That, you know, she is, you know, cheating him out of a potential nomination as the candidate, because the machine is well-oiled and pushing forward, despite his popular appeal. And the fact that he is resonating with a substantial amount of the electorate certainly has momentum, and the enthusiasm of the young voters and young women, as well, that are motivated by his candidacy.She has failed to grasp that sizable portion of the electorate that she was counting on and banking on, you know, for her candidacy. I think it's entirely problematic. Where do those people go if she is the nominee? Will they then just go ahead and pivot back to her out of no choice? I think it's going to depend on who the Republican nominee is.PERINO: Does it make me totally weak that I feel kind of sorry for her?BOLLING: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Where did that come from?PERINO: Oh, my gosh.BOLLING: She's been -- she's had that untrustworthy moniker the whole way through, and they're still voting for her. This is nothing new. Bernie Sanders is running on a 93 percent trustworthy rate. She's been under 30, I guess. Do you trust her? It doesn't matter. She crushed it in Nevada. She's down by 25 points in South Carolina.PERINO: But I think, if you're the nominee, that it really matters in the general, don't you think, Juan?WILLIAMS: I think Bill Clinton had a very low trustworthy rating and won the presidency twice. And I might point out that, while we're focused here on Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, if we get to Donald Trump, Cruz, Rubio, oh, my God, I think...PERINO: They're telling me to tease.WILLIAMS: Yes. I bet they are.GUILFOYLE: Dana. Benghazi.WILLIAMS: Because Donald Trump has a higher negative favorability rating than Hillary Clinton.PERINO: Historically true.GUILFOYLE: Benghazi. You won't feel sorry for her any more. Benghazi.WILLIAMS: I think her strength is when people say, as compared to what? As compared to Donald Trump? As compared to Ted Cruz? Who do I want representing me? Who do I think looks out for me? Empathy, competency, ideology? They pick Hillary Clinton.GUILFOYLE: He's the one they accused of influence peddling and the dirty tricks, the Clinton Foundation. Now you think she's so special and so sweet?WILLIAMS: No, no. I'm just telling you the facts. If you want...GUILFOYLE: Juan's for sale!WILLIAMS: If you want to say who is favorable and who's not favorable, who's negative, boy, Trump is the...PERINO: Remember...WILLIAMS: ... away and afar the winner.PERINO: Remember my favorite saying -- line written in this election cycle by Matthew Continetti at The Washington Free Beacon. ""If it's a race to the bottom, we can win it."" Excellent.All right. Next, we'll look ahead to the biggest day yet of this election cycle, Super Tuesday. Coming up in one week from now. ""The Five"" returns in just a moment. It does?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: The Nevada GOP caucuses are tonight, but the big kahuna of election contests is coming up a week from now on Super Tuesday. According to the latest polls, Donald Trump is expected to fare very well on March 1. A new survey shows he's also ahead in Ohio, which votes on March 15. So will Governor Kasich get out-Trumped in his home state? He says he won't.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will beat Donald Trump. I mean, it's all within the margin of error. We'll be fine in Ohio. And what we need to do is be able to have a respectful finish and be able to accumulate delegates as we move forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS; So Greg, when you -- when you look at Super Tuesday...GUTFELD: Yes, I do.WILLIAMS: ... is there any way that you would, if you were a political strategist, make a suggestion to Marco Rubio or to Ted Cruz and say, this is the way to beat Donald Trump.GUTFELD: I think you have to get beyond platitudes and promises and get to the specifics. And challenge -- challenge Donald on foreign policy. Even on -- even on his business acumen. You know, he's supposed to be a great businessman. Go after him on that.WILLIAMS: Well, Dana, you're -- you're a strategist. Let me hear it.PERINO: This election is so different than anything I've been involved in. And, you know, when the laws of gravity no longer apply, I think that we're in unchartered waters. We don't know.I do think that when Donald Trump says ""commonsensical conservative,"" that does speak to a lot of people. For example, remember last year, when the Pew poll came out and said that neither party had a majority of American support anymore. That they were now a majority independent. Then some people look at that.Now, conservatives, who he needs to turn out, not just here, but if he wins the nomination in the general election, they hear that and they say, ""Well, we think we are commonsensical."" We -- remember, the compassionate conservative, that was George W. Bush's line. It spoke to me. I really liked it. But I can understand why conservatives said, ""Do you mean the conservatives policies aren't compassionate?""WILLIAMS: Right.PERINO: And there was argument there. So I mean, I don't know how I would advise anybody else. But I think that's a point.WILLIAMS: Let me come to Eric on another point. Which is that tonight in Nevada, the question is, it's a caucus state. Can Donald Trump organize in a caucus state? And then going into Super Tuesday, where you have multiple states and you have to control multiple get-out-the-vote operations, does Donald Trump have the ground game to deliver?BOLLING: It's a caucus. I think it was a big -- we talked about this nonstop. It's just insane what's going to go...WILLIAMS: All right. Enough with your hatred of caucuses.GUILFOYLE: Yes, but it's bad for them, too.BOLLING: Do you know you can take a selfie with your ballot and send it to the Nevada GOP for your vote, to allegedly -- in Nevada, 33 to 50,000 people will decide 30 delegates. It's just -- it just doesn't -- the numbers are that Trump's going to do very well there.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: You asked Greg a question. What should Cruz or Rubio do? One of them has -- by the numbers, one has to get out of the race.WILLIAMS: It ain't happening. Nobody's getting out.BOLLING: Super Tuesday, 600 delegates. If Trump -- if Trump gets -- if Trump gets a third of those only, he's up 300 and some delegates. Then it goes to winner-take-all. He's winning in almost every single one of the winner-take-all states.WILLIAMS: You haven't answered my question about the ground game.PERINO: I think he's already proven that.WILLIAMS: All right. So Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Thank you for the question, sir. Move on.WILLIAMS: More than a third of Republican voters said, ""You know, I really haven't made up my mind yet."" Could that change the equation?GUILFOYLE: Good opportunity. And if what you want is to take back the White House and someone that can win and shore up support, then you should think about who you think that candidate could be. Somebody that -- also, you want somebody that can beat Hillary Clinton, who's going to be the nominee and win in the general election and peel away some moderates and independents to be able to come to the Republican side and vote and support that candidate. That's what you should be looking at.WILLIAMS: All right. Don't miss ""The Five"" Super Tuesday pre-game show this single at 5 p.m. Eastern.""One More Thing"" up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Time for ""One More Thing."" Dana's up first.PERINO: All right. The rise of walking and texting. You've done it before. You've probably run into something. But have you ever run into a beautiful piece of art? Sophie Ryder sculpted this kissing -- let's see. What was it called? I want to say -- it was called ""The Kiss."" These are two hands. It's at Salisbury Cathedral in England.They had to have a crane move it, because people were not even paying attention to the art and the beautiful cathedral around them. Because of their walking and texting. They kept bumping their heads on it. So it became, like, a public health hazard.Sophie, it's a beautiful sculpture, and I'm glad you sent us the video.BOLLING: Aren't you going to say something about...PERINO: Pay attention when you're walking.GUTFELD: Get a grip (ph).BOLLING: I'm sorry. Go.PERINO: Greg's Corny Joke of the Day.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Identity News.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: You know, we've watched a lot of people deciding who they want to be. Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who decided she wanted to be black. You had Shawn King, white guy decides he wants to be black. What if you decided you wanted to be a cheeseburger?Well, a man, Sam Smith, has legally changed his name to Bacon Double Cheeseburger.GUILFOYLE: That's so delicious.GUTFELD: He did this after a night of drinking. I know, a big surprise. His mother and his fiance are unhappy about this. But his dad thinks it's hysterical. But I think this is fantastic. I think I'm going to...GUILFOYLE: Yes, because you can make fun of him, but you're not walking around like, ""Hey, you can call me Bacon. You can call me Double Cheeseburger."" But they are delicious, so I understand his inspiration. I'm going to change my name is Kimberly Salami.BOLLING: Juan, you're up.WILLIAMS: So last night, President Frank Underwood, a.k.a. Kevin Spacey in ""House of Cards,"" unveiled his presidential portrait at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN SPACEY, ACTOR: And I wonder if the 30 million people who visit this institution every year will pass by this portrait and see the image of a calm, determined president ready for any challenge. Or if this painting is hung at just the right height, viewers will wonder instead if I'm about to kick them in the face.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: This is real. This is not...GUTFELD: No, it's not!WILLIAMS: Yes! He really did it, and it's going to be on public view...GUTFELD: No!WILLIAMS: ... starting Wednesday through October.GUTFELD: That's wrong.GUILFOYLE: This show is becoming, like, urban legend.BOLLING: So -- so life is about happy moments and sad moments. Last night I had both.First, let's start with the sad one. Wayne Rogers, a beloved colleague, passed away recently. Juan and I attended a memorial service for Wayne. There's a picture of Wayne's widow right there in the middle and the other members of the ""Cashin' In"" crew right there. A very, very nice service. Alan Alda was there, Loretta Swit and what not. It was a sad moment but a happy moment, nonetheless.Then I had the good fortune to meet up with my good friends Steve and Andrea Wynn. They're there right there. By the way, Steve will appear on American Election Headquarters tonight, talking about the Nevada caucuses. And then here's me being really nerdy, taking a selfie of myself in front of a Picasso.K.G., you're up.GUILFOYLE: I'm sorry for the loss of your friend. He was fantastic.BOLLING: Great guy. Good man.GUILFOYLE: I loved being on there with him, as well.Let's talk about attraction, shall we, and who we might be attracted to and whether or not it means you have a lasting relationship, right? People say opposites attract, like me and Greg. Yes, that's not going to work out, actually. Because there was a study done, and ""The Daily Mail"" had it, that apparently a better chance of staying together if you're similar. More like birds of a feather flock together.GUTFELD: So gay marriage.GUILFOYLE: Perfect. I guess. If you mean same sex.PERINO: Terrible.""Special Report.""Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 Roll Call, Inc.

The video, which has been watched over four million times, shows Graham telling Jordan that there's too much smoke emanating from Jordan's commercial-grade grill.""I just took three pictures of smoke,"" Graham explains. ""I can smell it again right now. You're allowed to have it smell on your property, so that doesn't count, but when I'm on the street, that's when it counts.""Jordan can be heard laughing in the video as the specialist continues to explain the problem.""Is that against the law?"" one of the men questions.Graham proceeds to pull out his handbook and informs the men that neighbors are allowed to call in if they have concerns about barbecue smoke.  Pinellas County has a 24 hour hotline for residents to call in an emergency air quality complaint.According to the ordinance, ""commercial barbecue cookers are not exempt from causing a nuisance odor. If a sufficient number of complaints, representing different households, are reported and an Inspector witnesses the problem, they can issue a Warning Letter.""The two men continue to laugh in disbelief and explain that other neighbors routinely cook out but no one appears to issuing warnings to them.""So everyone in the whole world can cook out except me,"" Jordan can he heard saying.Graham also says that in order to avoid a warning, the men should first check wind patterns before starting to barbecue--or upgrade their equipment to a newer model designed to curtail smoke and odors. Graham's friend, who videoed the entire scene says, ""We can't control the wind, God does that.""In an email obtained by Florida Politics, Pinellas County Administrator Mark Woodard says that the inspector was responding 15 smoke and odor grievances against Jordan since September, 2014. He said that Graham was merely sent out to educate the resident. According to SaintPetersBlog, no citation was issued to Jordan.  "
7	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/12/15/bill-oreilly-age-anger/	Bill O'Reilly: The age of anger	"A new Gallup poll says 16 percent of Americans now believe terrorism is the most important problem facing the country today; 13 percent say dissatisfaction with the government; the economy stands at 9 percent.So you can see that anger and fear are presently driving American politics. That has led to the rise of one Donald Trump. And to some extent also fuels the candidacy of Bernie Sanders.On the right, President Obama is making many folks furious. They feel that he is a weak leader who has imposed economic hardship on the nation by stifling the private marketplace in order to redistribute wealth in the pursuit of social justice. Thus, millions of voters simply want to elect someone who will smash Mr. Obama's domestic policies and reimpose America as a strong force in the world.According to all the polls, President Obama is perceived to be ineffective in fighting the jihadists. The more terror attacks there are, the lower the President's poll numbers will go. It is not a stretch to say that Barack Obama has polarized the U.S.A. as much as Richard Nixon did.But, it's not all about Mr. Obama. Many on the right believe the Republican Party is cowardly and also ineffective. They want an avenger representing the party. They want Trump or someone like him.Add to that the PC madness that is running rampant in the U.S.A. That is driven by the far left.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BELTRAN: The one possibly useful thing here is perhaps we can expand the logic of terrorism and talk about white racial terrorism. And talk about the way white fear has garnered racial violence historically from anti-immigrant riots to anti-black riots to lynch mobs.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: So forget about Muslim extremism, it is now white racial terrorism that the far left believes is a threat. Again, this kind of insane stuff makes people angry.Now, on the other side, the Bernie Sanders, Black Lives Matter crew is furious as well. They believe America is and always has been an oppressive place. The far left wants reparations for slavery, social justice payments and a destruction of the so-called white privilege, capitalistic system.These Americans see Hillary Clinton is far too moderate. They want to blow up the whole system and impose a strident view of the world that does not tolerate dissent. The numbers on the far left are far less than on the traditional right. But the anger is equal.So, we are living in turbulent times. The U.S.A. is embracing political figures like Trump and Sanders which just a few years ago would have been unthinkable. And even if those guys do not prevail, America is now a deeply divided and politically unhappy place where anything can happen.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years. He joined the network in 1996 and is based in New York. Click here for more information on Bill O'Reilly. "

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: So with Senator Cruz dropping out last night and Governor Kasich dropping out just over two hours ago, get ready for a general election slug fest.The GOP race is all or nearly all wrapped up. And now Donald Trump is zeroing in on the likely Trump-Clinton match up.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE GOP NOMINEE: Hillary Clinton is a jokeHILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't know that he has any boundaries at all.TRUMP: She was going to beat Obama. She was favored to win and she got Trumped. She lost.CLINTON: Finally a candidate whose hair gets more attention than mine.TRUMP: She is a liar, wouldn't you say, right? You only have one Lyin' Ted. I don't think we can use the same term for Hillary.CLINTON: His bigotry, his bluster, his bullying have become his campaign.TRUMP: I told you she is like a snake with no energy. She doesn't have the strength and she doesn't have the stamina.CLINTON: This is to me a classic case of a blustering, bullying guy.TRUMP: Crooked Hillary, right? Crooked. She is crooked as you can be. Crooked Hillary.(END VIDEOTAPE)VAN SUSTEREN: And to think they were friends.Now how wild will this election ride get? Should we fasten our seat belts now?Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich goes ON THE RECORD.Good evening, sir.NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Good evening.VAN SUSTEREN: This will be brutal.GINGRICH: I think it will be one of the wildest elections in American history.VAN SUSTEREN: Now, most people never -- I shouldn't say most people. The so-called Republican elites and the media are never predicted that Trump would win.In fact, even you've got ""Nate Silver FiveThirtyEight"" according to your article, or according to something you wrote, wrote in August are emphatic prediction. Not just regular prediction. Emphatic prediction is simply that Trump will not win the nomination. It's not even clear that he is trying to do so.GINGRICH: Well, it's fascinating. If you go back over the last year, and that's why I wrote we do a newsletter twice a week at Gingrich Productions.When you look at it, all these people said Trump was gone. Trump was a joke. Trump would never be there. Now, all the same people are trying to tell you about the general election.And, you have to start by saying since none of them understood Trump up through winning the nomination, why would you believe they have a clue what the general election is going to be like.VAN SUSTEREN: How did they get -- how did so many people get it so wrong? Because the American people are really unhappy. And that's why I think why Bernie has surged.GINGRICH: You know, the turning point for me and Ross Worthington who works for me went back and found that I had said in September that Trump would probably be the nominee.And the turning point for me was the night of the first ""Fox"" debate, when Trump had a collision with Megyn Kelly, and Frank Luntz did this focus group and they all said Trump had lost, and everybody in the mainstream media got together and said Trump lost, and then you watched on Facebook and Google and Twitter. And Trump was winning by 65 or 70 percent. And I look to that and I though to myself, there is something happening out here with the American people that none of the folks of the elite get.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, you know what I think part of it is? Is that America -- everything is pretty much just fine for the media. They all have jobs. We all feed off this stuff. But for the American people, if you actually go out and talk to the American people, things aren't so fine.GINGRICH: Right.VAN SUSTEREN: You know, their wages are stagnant. Things aren't great. It's like nobody ever bothered to go out and talk to them.GINGRICH: Well, and I think when you start talking to people of every background, you find that, in fact, whether you are African-American or Latino or Asian-American, whether you are a millennial or your grandparent, there is this sense of anxiety about what's coming next, what's going to happen.And I think Trump intuitive of that, really communicated it. And he had been -- if you notice, he has been gaining strength. You know, for a while they said, OK, he has got 35 percent. He will never get 50 percent. Now he's got 60 percent. But he will never be able to beat Hillary.Well, my question is how could anybody possibly be that certain considering how wrong they were the whole time?VAN SUSTEREN: And as a side is that Jimmy Carter in 1908 was winning right now and Reagan won by 10 points in November.But one last quick question. Any interest in being the vice president because Donald Trump says he wants someone who has a background in politics.GINGRICH: Oh, he had all sorts of nice words to say. Look, I'm not seeking it. I doubt -- I think it's a thousand to one against it. But I think you have to pay attention if a potential president of the United States talks to you.VAN SUSTEREN: Has he called you?GINGRICH: No.VAN SUSTEREN: OK. Just checking. Just checking.He hasn't called me, either.(CROSSTALK)GINGRICH: I promise you I will let you know if he calls.VAN SUSTEREN: I will be the first to know, right?GINGRICH: You will be on the short list.VAN SUSTEREN: Yes, right. The short list of about 2,000.Anyway, nice to see you, Mr. Speaker."
