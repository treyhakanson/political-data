 White House Policy or Politics? 
"	"And now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine... House CallGood government groups and some Republicans are questioning the propriety of a Democratic Party-sponsored event with Wall Street executives at the White House back in March. The administration maintains it was a meeting about the economy not a fundraiser. Critics say it may have violated the Hatch Act, the law that limits the political activity and fundraising by federal employees.Two attendees told Politico the event was clearly related to the campaign. One said -- quote -- ""It was policy-focused, but everyone knew why they were there.""Applause LineThere was an actual fundraiser last night in Washington and the White House was not laughing about an error in the transcript.President Obama said the administration has created over 2 million private sector jobs. The original transcript noted ""laughter"" after that remark.Late this afternoon, reporters received a revised transcript by e-mail. The new transcript noted ""applause"" instead of laughter after the line.My Name Is...One big challenge for the campaign of newly-minted presidential candidate Jon Huntsman is name recognition and that was painfully evident during today's kickoff event.Some media passes distributed by Huntsman's own people had Huntsman's first name spelled incorrectly on that pass. It's J-O-N, no ""H.""""Under"" FireAnd finally, last night ""NBC Nightly News"" included the backlash over Sunday's omission of ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance during the U.S. Open golf coverage, in a story labeled ""Bad Decisions,"" quoting from a second apology from NBC in as many days.Reporter Mike Taibbi then went on to reference the Obama impersonator who was pulled off stage early during the Republican Leadership Conference and Jon Stewart's appearance on ""Fox News Sunday.""One conservative media watchdog said NBC was -- quote -- ""trying to submerge its own network's 'under God' censorship into a greater narrative.""Late today, Indiana Republican Senator Dan Coats sent a letter to NBC asking for an explanation of what happened with the Pledge."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, 'ON THE RECORD' GUEST HOST: Military veteran and former Congressman Allen West joins us.Colonel, so did the U.S. reveal too much details about this plan to retake Mosul?COL. ALLEN WEST, FORMER CONGRESSMAN AND VETERAN: Well, absolutely. It's a pleasure to be with you, Kimberly. When you look at the history of military warfare, think about Operation Overload and D-Day and the lengths we went to for a deception plan. I recall in Operation Desert Shield, Desert Storm, the deception plan we had that made Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi army focus offshore of Kuwait city while we were deep in the desert. Only -- I have seen in the Vietnam War when the Viet Cong surprised during the Tet Offensive, so why would we tip our hand and say we're going to come sometime after the open enrollment of Obamacare, maybe right after tax season, but definitely before Ramadan. We even disclose the size and type and composition of the forces that are going to be used. We have totally lost the key element of surprise in divulging all this information.GUILFOYLE: How do we rationalize this? What is the explanation? If you didn't know better you'd think someone was playing for the other team by handing over our game plan on Super Bowl day.WEST: Well, there are two things. Maybe the Obama administration is using this as some type of deception for a grander plan or strategy, which I really doubt. So I really believe that this defaults to a political decision by an administration that wants people to believe that it is doing something, when actually they are not doing anything, and so they are going to divulge this plan. Just the same as we see nothing being done to help the Ukrainians against the onslaught of Russia, we're not seeing any action really be taken by this administration in the Iraqi theater of operations.GUILFOYLE: From the strategy, engaging in counterterrorism, we are giving away our upper hand by telegraphing constantly and consistently to our enemies and our adversaries our next move. Whether it's withdrawing troops, when we're going to get out, when we're going to deploy, we seem to be very transparent when it comes to military operations, but not other things.WEST: No, you're absolutely right. It defies all logic that you tell an enemy that you are going to leave on such a date and you're going to declare end of combat operations. This is why I am vehemently against the Congress granting the authorization of military force to President Obama because once again he has come out and said that we're just going to do this for three years. How does he know it's going to take three years? What if it takes six months? Furthermore, he has not laid out a clear strategy. It was a regurgitation of what he said back in August. We saw how horrifically that strategy has failed because ISIS has gained in strength, and we know they now have affiliations in 11 or 12 different countries.GUILFOYLE: That's the problem. The president wants us to think, yes, he is taking this seriously and asking for this use of military force and authorization, but as you well know, Colonel, the president has everything he needs within his power to be able to act decisively and definitively with respect to ISIS. This just hamstrings, by setting up a specific time frame, three years. Why would you do that, especially with another president coming in, in 2016?WEST: Well, again, I think that you have a president that is reticent in dealing with this situation. He has been forced into somewhat having to sheepishly admit that his strategy of complete withdrawal in Iraq has failed. He has created a vacuum. He has created an even worse vacuum in Libya as well. They don't know what to do with this. We continue to hear what he is not willing to do, not put grand troops in. He can't even bring himself to say who this enemy is and define them, which violates everything that Sun Tzu presented in ""The Art of War,"" that you must know your enemy and you must know yourself.GUILFOYLE: If you're in charge of these operations, what would you tell the president the advice should be to win this war against Islamic extremism?WEST: Well, first of all, you have to diplomatically use force against those states that are sponsoring these non-state belligerents. When you look at Qatar, Turkey, and to some extent Saudi Arabia, you have to cut them diplomatically and cut their financial resources off as well. Most importantly, you have to be able to defeat this theocratic, political, totalitarian ideology by admitting what it is and using your informational resources, your media and other means, by which you defeat that which is fueling it. If you can't bring yourself to admit what it is, as we saw this week after this countering violent extremism summit, then you're not going to be successful in the first place.GUILFOYLE: You're absolutely right.Colonel West, it's always a pleasure. Thank you for your time.WEST: Thank you, Kimberly."

She was incredibly gracious to me when I met her a few months ago.As you may know, the White House has kept Mrs. Obama away from politics. Her primary cause has been the problem of overweight children. But this week the first lady appeared at the NAACP convention in Kansas City.Click here to watch ""Talking Points""!(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA: When so many of our children still attend crumbling schools, and a black child is still far more likely to go to prison than a white child, I think the founders of this organization would agree that our work is not yet done. When stubborn inequality still persist in education and health, in income and wealth, I think those founders would urge us to increase our intensity, and to increase our discipline and our focus, and keep fighting for a better future for our children and our grandchildren.(END VIDEO CLIP)Mrs. Obama is not wrong. There are still many minority young people attending bad schools and having trouble with the law. But how to solve that problem is the crux of the debate.The president and the first lady believe that the federal government must right wrongs in this area. They want big money and resources to pour into poor neighborhoods, funding a variety of programs.The problem is that strategy is not cost effective anymore. The great society entitlement program is going on 50 years, and still ghettos remain, social problems abound.Conservative Americans largely reject the big government programs that have cost the taxpayer trillions of dollars in favor of self-reliance and local solutions. And ""Talking Points"" believes that the feds should step back and allow the folks to correct problems in their own neighborhoods. As they said in the 1960s, power to the people.Let's take black crime for example. African-Americans make up 13 percent of the population, but according to the Justice Department, they comprise 39 percent of violent crime convictions. Thirty-six percent of all murders in America are committed by African-Americans, and 90 percent of black homicide victims are killed by other blacks.Now, some African-Americans blame an oppressive white society for their problems, and a case could be made for that some years ago. But now the landscape has changed.Another example, Mrs. Obama cites crumbling schools. But many Democrats oppose school vouchers that provide opportunity for black children to attend better schools on the government's dime.Why do liberals oppose school vouchers? Because they are protecting the teachers' unions.I believe Michelle Obama is a good woman who wants the best for all Americans. But she is a liberal thinker and so is her husband, the president, and these big government entitlements are not working anymore. We need more targeted solutions.Personal responsibility, good parenting and discipline in neighborhoods and schools are the keys to an equal and just society.I don't think the NAACP believes that at all, but it's the truth.And that's ""The Memo.""Pinheads & PatriotsSinger Krista Branch, who performed on ""American Idol,"" has written a song dedicated to the Tea Party people.Click here to listen to part of the song!For honoring legitimate protest, Ms. Branch is a patriot.On the pinhead front, Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman made the mistake of holding a town hall meeting, where the Black Panther situation came up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. BRAD SHERMAN, D-CALIF.: I am extremely sure that we do not have a policy at the Department of Justice of never prosecuting a black defendant.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, you do!SHERMAN: I'm sure it may say that somewhere on the Internet, but that doesn't mean it's true. As to the Black Panther Party, I'm simply not aware of that case.(END VIDEO CLIP)Is the congressman a pinhead? Looks that way."
