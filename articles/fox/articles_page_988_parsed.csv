"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" July 22, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST:  And this is a ""Fox News Alert.""  Welcome to ""Hannity."" Tonight, Hillary Clinton has announced that she has selected Virginia senator Tim Kaine to be her running mate.Joining us now with the very latest, campaign Carl Cameron.  Sir, not a surprise to me.CARL CAMERON, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Hi.  Not a surprise, Sean.  This name has been out there at the top of the list for quite some time, and there was even some scurrying around about the exact timing in which she'd tweet today, and there was a little bit of a delay and people were sort of astounded by that.Tim Kaine is not a surprise.  And it's a selection that's a safe one for Hillary Clinton.  He's from Virginia, a very important swing state.  He has held a number of offices.  He's a former governor of Virginia, now the U.S. senator from Virginia.  He's also been the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.  He's very, very well-known and generally well liked in the Democratic Party, considered to be not quite a blue dog or a conservative Democrat, but at least a centrist.And he differs with Hillary Clinton on a variety of things.  He's a strong supporter of free trade, and while he hasn't said specifically that he'd vote for the Trans Pacific Partnership.  Hillary Clinton has said that she opposes it.  He has supported in the past a variety of issues that Hillary Clinton doesn't agree with.He is Catholic.  He is pro-life, although he does support a woman's right to choose.  He in Virginia supports clean coal.  Of course, Virginia is a mining state.  He supports right to work, something that -- and Virginia's supportive -- and Virginia is a right to work state.These are all things that Hillary Clinton over the years has had objections to.  But Virginia being a swing state, it's obviously an opportunity for him to do well.And Donald Trump has been campaigning in the Norfolk area, for the Naval Yard, talking about veterans' issues, et cetera.  In fact, he's going to Roanoke just next week.  And the campaign has, through its spokesman, Jason Miller, put out a statement trashing the Kaine selection, saying that now crooked Hillary has effectively hired corrupt Kaine because he's taken gifts that, actually, he has legally disclosed over the years, but it's over $150,000 worth, and says that he, like so many of the mainstream sort of establishment politicians that Trump has accused of rigging the system, has profited from it, and therefore, the Clinton/Kaine ticket will not be politically and/or economically profitable for the American people, Sean.HANNITY:  Hey, Carl.  Let me ask you a quick question.  She really has had a problem with her left-wing base, though, and I don't know if this gets her far with them.  I think you're right in your analysis about Virginia. Certainly, there's a conflict on coal, even abortion in some sense.CAMERON:  Sure.HANNITY:  But you got 20,000 hacked DNC e-mails released on the eve of the Democratic convention by Wikileaks.  Bernie Sanders has had some 50,000 supporters, protesters, if you will, that are headed to Philadelphia as we speak.CAMERON:  Right.HANNITY:  I think with the release of those e-mails and the DNC colluding with Hillary and trying to smear him on issues related to religion and planting stories in the press that his campaign is a mess and in shambles, I don't know if this is going to -- this is not going to go over very well or win over many Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders people, right?CAMERON:  Clearly -- well, yes, of course.  They're going to be outraged by this, and understandably so.  Conversely, however, Bernie Sanders's candidacy, and frankly, the presence of Elizabeth Warren in Democratic politics did in the Clinton campaign's mind push the candidate Hillary to her own left.  And her flip-flop on the TPP -- she was in support of it, and then, Wait a minute, this isn't going to help me in the upcoming presidential campaign, and she decided she's going to hold off and now -- at least for now, she's opposed to it.Donald Trump will tell you as soon as she gets into office, she's going to go forward with the TPP if she were to win.  Trump, of course, opposes it. So you know, on some level, this may be her attempt to try to move back to the center from being so far left, being pushed there by Bernie Sanders.HANNITY:  It's interesting, though, in light of the polls that showed that 20-plus percent of Bernie supporters would vote for Donald Trump, especially on issues of trade.  So they made a conscious decision here to not go after that base, not go after the Bernie supporters.  And Bernie did extraordinarily well in the primary...CAMERON:  Right.HANNITY:  ... and much better than anybody thought, considering this was a coronation.  And now we know collusion went on with the DNC.CAMERON:  Hillary Clinton is in a very, very tough space.  She knows that the Bernie Sanders voters and a big part of the Elizabeth Warren wing of the party do not think that she is sufficiently liberal.  She also recognizes that there are an awful lot of Democrats who just think that she's not a particularly charismatic character -- charismatic candidate, and so she's trying to do the kind of selection that will do the least harm.And Tim Kaine, having been around as long as he is, very, very well known to Democratic voters, he doesn't bring a lot of mystery.  We've already outlined some of it, and there's a whole encyclopedic history of him because he's been in politics for so long.  So it becomes Hillary at the top of the ticket, and Kaine as a supporting candidate doesn't draw too much attention away, they hope.HANNITY:  All right, campaign Carl Cameron, thank you, as always.Here now with reaction, former Obama economic adviser -- he's partly responsible for the mess we're in right now -- Austan Goolsbee, former White House press secretary...AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FMR. OBAMA ADVISER:  Totally responsible!HANNITY:  No, I blame your boss...GOOLSBEE:  Totally...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... he actually listened to you.  That was his mistake number one.  Former Bush press secretary, our friend, Ari Fleischer, and Washington Examiner contributor Lisa Boothe.Ari, let me start with you.  Very important decision.  I thought it was one of the best stories, how George W. Bush had picked Dick Cheney, who was given the assignment to actually do the search for him, and he ended up picking him.  I think Mike Pence -- I'll be honest, I think it worked out perfectly for Donald Trump, a really good choice for him.I understand the arguments about Tim Kaine and Virginia, but I really worry-- if I was the Clinton people, I would be a little bit worried about that left flank.  What's going to happen in Philly next week, the Bernie, Elizabeth Warren wing of the party -- how are they going to react?ARI FLEISCHER, FMR. BUSH PRESS SECRETARY:  Well, first of all, Carl is right.  It is no surprise that she picked Tim Kaine.  She likes him and she knows him, and I think the most important qualification is that you get along with the nominee and the nominee has comfort that if something happened, you could become president.I think a lot of this is overthought.  Vice presidential selection, frankly, is of no major consequence because the election really is Hillary versus Trump, and that's the basis on which people are going to vote.  This is fascinating, good stuff for a day or three, but then it's going to quickly fade as everybody focuses on the two at the top.As for the ideology of it -- look, this is Hillary's race.  She is a liberal, so it doesn't matter if she picks somebody who is a centrist on one or two issues.  She's a liberal, and this is a liberal ticket.HANNITY:  What's your reaction, Lisa?LISA BOOTHE, HIGH NOON STRATEGIES:  Well, Sean, look, Hillary Clinton is a lackluster candidate and Senator Tim Kaine is a generic Democrat.  He does nothing -- as a centrist Democrat, he does nothing to help her with the progressive base, which is really questioning her authenticity of this leftward swing that we have seen from her.He also does nothing to help her with the Obama coalition, which she desperately needs to rebuild.  If you'll remember, black voters turned out in higher margins than white voters in 2008 and 2012 to help support and vote for the first African-American president.  So she really needs that African-American turnout.Also, he doesn't do anything to help her with younger millennials, who have supported Bernie Sanders to great degree in the Democratic primary, either. I also don't know how much he helps her with female voters or Hispanics, as well.So I think it's sort of a boring choice that really doesn't do much to really help her out here.HANNITY:  Well, let me -- I just got this on my iPhone.  I'll read it to my friend, Austan Goolsbee.  It's the headline from the Trump campaign.   ""Clinton doubles down on corruption for the status quo ticket.""  Quote, ""It's only fitting that Hillary Clinton would select an ethically challenged insider like Tim Kaine, who's personally benefited from the rigged system.  While serving in government, Kaine had taken tens of thousands of dollars in freebies, more than $160,000, in fact, free vacations, free clothes.""All right, this is going to be fun to watch.GOOLSBEE:  Wait.  Sean, was this literally on the same day that the Donald Trump campaign released that it has paid Donald Trump's own companies more than $200,000 on its campaign?  They're the ones saying that Tim Kaine is taking freebies?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  With all due respect, he's also spent millions and millions and millions of dollars of his own money.  This is taking money within government, just like Hillary Clinton would -- so this is...GOOLSBEE:  Sean, I know you're scared.HANNITY:  This is like Hillary Clinton...GOOLSBEE:  I know you're scared.HANNITY:  Can I finish?  Compromising her values, and she says she's a champion of women's rights and religious rights and LGBT rights, but she takes money from countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and others, and they abuse women.  They kill gays and lesbians, and they persecute Christians and Jews, and you can't build a temple or a church.  That's hypocritical.GOOLSBEE:  I know you're scared.  Sean, I know you're scared of...HANNITY:  Scared of Tim Kaine?GOOLSBEE:  He's a great pick.HANNITY:  Scared of Tim Kaine?GOOLSBEE:  You should be scared.  He's going to be great.HANNITY:  Ari Fleischer, you know what?  I now got my brown belt.  I'm working towards my black belt.  There's very little I'm afraid of now in life, and I can promise you Tim Kaine is not on that list.(LAUGHTER)FLEISCHER:  My advice to Republicans would be if there's any framing here, that essentially, it's an inside-the-Beltway ticket.  Hillary Clinton is from Washington, D.C., and Tim Kaine is from Virginia.And against Donald Trump, who is obviously an outsider, and Mike Pence, who really is an outsider, as well, being from Indiana.  So I think you've got this sense of inside the Beltway, secretary of the status quo versus the change agents in the country, which are Trump and Pence.That's the case I'd urge Republicans to make.  But still, Kaine will fade. Pence will fade.  This is Hillary versus Donald Trump.HANNITY:  You know, there is an indicator where, Lisa -- I think the Trump convention was enormously successful.  I think he'll probably get a pretty good bounce out of it.  We'll find out sometime next week.But on every level, it goes about as good as any convention can go.  I think his kids were a home run.  I think General Flynn was great, Rudy.  I think Chris Christie did a good job.  Ben Carson did a good job, the powerful statement of parents who lost children killed by illegal immigrants.  So all of that.And then next week, we're going to hear from Black Lives Matters (sic) mothers.  Next week, we're going to hear from Trayvon's mother in that case.  I assume we're going to hear that global warming and global cooling and climate change are more dangerous than terrorism next week, and Republicans want dirty air and water next week.  It's going to be an interesting contrast.  What do you anticipate?BOOTHE:  Well, yes, I think we're going to see a lot of that, exactly what you just laid out.  And look, this -- make no mistake about it.  This is the year of the disaffected voter.  This is the year where people are really calling for change, the year of the outsider.  We saw this with Bernie Sander (sic) on the left and with Donald Trump on the right.And to Ari's point, I really do think that's what Hillary Clinton chose. She chose an insider at a time where Americans are becoming exceedingly frustrated with the institution, with government, with politicians. There's a general lack of trust, and Senator Tim Kaine only feeds into that narrative.  He's part of the problem.  Hillary Clinton is part of the problem.And I think -- I agree with Ari where that is the big hit for Donald Trump to continue to drive that narrative, that they're both part of the problem that people are so desperately desiring change.HANNITY:  You know, and I'm sure, Austan, you would defend the president against Donald Trump's speech last night, where we have millions more Americans on food stamps and in poverty and out of the labor force, and he takes on more debt than every other president combined.Are you going to also defend him on ISIS and Iraq and on Syria and on Libya?  Are you going to -- foreign policy -- are you going to defend the president?GOOLSBEE:  What I was going to say is one thing you're not going to hear at the Democratic convention next week is a one-hour-and-13-minute sourpuss Chicken Little fear-mongering old man, Get off my lawn...BOOTHE:  We're just going to hear a bunch of pandering!GOOLSBEE:  ... acceptance speech that Donald Trump gave.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Every general election, democrats play the race card.  Ari, you remember that ad, the James Byrd ad.GOOLSBEE:  Are you honestly saying that Donald Trump is not playing the race card?HANNITY:  I guarantee at this -- during the course of this campaign, Hillary Clinton will play the race card, play the gender card, try and scare granny into thinking Republicans...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... and destroy the air and water.  It'll happen.  How much do you want to bet?GOOLSBEE:  We already know that you favor unsafe air and dirty water.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  I only want dirty air and water for you.  The rest of us, I want clean air and water.(LAUGHTER)BOOTHE:  But Sean?HANNITY:  Yes.BOOTHE:  Part of Hillary Clinton's problem is because she has pandered so much.  She has been on every side of every single issue.  So Democrats and especially the progressive base really questions her authenticity.  This is something that has been in question...HANNITY:  Well said.BOOTHE:  ... both her likability and the authenticity.GOOLSBEE:  But it's not.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  All right, we got to roll.  Guys, good to see you.And coming up -- sorry.  If I'm going to cut anybody off, it should be Goolsbee.Anyway, Germany on high alert tonight after an 18-year-old German-Iranian killed at least nine people now, a shooting rampage that happened earlier today.  Our own Catherine Herridge -- she's coming up next with a full report and update.  We'll also get reaction from Dr. Gorka, Ollie North.And then later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we're going to defeat them fast!BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The world has never been less violent, healthier, better educated, more tolerant.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  What is he talking about?  Less violent?  Never been -- are you kidding me?  Donald Trump promises to defeat ISIS, while President Obama shockingly claimed that the world has never been safer than now before (ph).  We have cops being assassinated, a terror attack every other day. Really?  We'll have reaction to all of that and more tonight as ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  And this is a ""Fox News Alert.""  Terror has struck Europe once again.  Earlier today, an 18-year-old German-Iranian opened fire, killing nine, wounding 16 others in Munich.  Now, tonight, authorities say the gunman's motives -- well, they're still, quote, ""fully unclear.""  Now, amateur video shows when the shooter opened fire on pedestrians outside of a McDonald's.We've got to warn you, the video you're about to see is extremely graphic. Watch this.(VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Here now with the very latest in D.C. is Fox News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge.  Catherine, we hear that sound all too often.CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's right, Sean.  Tonight, ISIS social media accounts are lighting up and celebrating the attack in Munich the same way they did a week ago when an ISIS supporter mowed down 84 people with his truck in Nice, France.  But to be clear, there's been no claim of responsibility for the shooting, and the Munich police chief just told German television it's too early to say whether it was a terrorist attack or a shooting rampage.The latest information is that the suspect was 18 years old, and the shooter's body was found about two-and-a-half hours after the attack in a side street near the mall.  Based on a review of security camera video and interviews, the German police have concluded that two others who fled the scene had nothing to do with the attack.  At one point, today they were searching for as many as three suspects.This is the third major attack against civilians in Western Europe in the last eight days.  On Monday, a teenage Afghan refugee wielding a machete attacked five people on a German commuter train, turning the carriage into a slaughterhouse, that attack claimed by ISIS posting a crude martyrdom video of the suspect on line.And last week, a 31-year-old Frenchman mowed down families gathering to watch the fireworks celebrating France's independence day.  The latest intelligence suggests this driver plotted the attacks for months in advance and had at least four accomplices.We don't know a lot about tonight's attack or the motivation in Munich, but a terrorism analyst is drawing our attention to the fact that the targeting of children at the Munich McDonald's and in Nice -- this is the style of attack that is advocated by terror groups because murdering children leaves the deepest scar in the community, Sean.HANNITY:  Catherine, agreed totally.  Thank you for your report.HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.HANNITY:  One quick question.  There had been an earlier report during the day that it might not be radical Islam, that it could, in fact, be some type of racial group.  That has now been debunked.HERRIDGE:  Well, it's unclear based on what the Munich police chief said. He said it's either one of two things.  He says it's either a shooting rampage or terrorism, and he's still waiting to assess that based on what they find in the electronics, which would be the phones and the computers.HANNITY:  All right.  Thanks so much, Catherine Herridge.HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.HANNITY:  Joining us now with more, the author of ""Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War,"" Dr. Sebastian Gorka, and the host of ""War Stories,"" Colonel Oliver North.I want to go to Donald Trump's speech last night.  And this is a shorter version of Hillary's legacy of failure because it's so appropriate in light of assassinations of police officers, which they're now being ambushed as they lie in wait, and then similarly every other day, if it's not that, it's a terror attack.  Listen to Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  ISIS has spread across the region and the entire world!  Libya is in ruins, and our ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers!  Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim Brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.  Iraq is in chaos.  Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.  Syria is engulfed in a civil war, and a refugee crisis now threatens the West.After 15 years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before!  This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton, death, destruction, terrorism and weakness!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  The situation is worse than it's ever been, legacy of Hillary Clinton, death, destruction, terrorism, weakness.  Colonel North, reaction.OLIVER NORTH, ""WAR STORIES"" HOST:  Well, and Obama went today and said this vision of violence and chaos everywhere doesn't square with what most Americans know.  I think most Americans know exactly what president -- I'm sorry -- what Mr. Trump said last night, and I think what's happened in Munich today says otherwise to what the president said.Look, we are living in a new world disorder, and the litany he just ran through last night is right on the mark.  And it all began with these guys coming to town.  As Dr. Gorka knows, 2009, the failed backing of the Green revolution in Iran, 2011, he surrenders the ground that was won with American blood in Iraq.  Russia and China (INAUDIBLE) I can go on with the other litany.  You don't need it.  It's all there, and he's right.  And Hillary's wrong.HANNITY:  And Hillary is wrong.  What do you make, Dr. Gorka, about Obama, the world has never been less violent?  What alternate reality is he living in?  What Alice in Wonderland fantasy is he in as of right now because it's almost on a daily basis, sadly, we have to report this.SEBASTIAN GORKA, ""DEFEATING JIHAD"" AUTHOR:  It's like the movie ""The Matrix,"" and he's in the matrix and he refuses to take the red pill.  He's created this narrative, and he just has to live in it.And the colonel is absolutely right.  I'm going to have to steal that phrase.  This is a new world disorder.  And you know who's responsible for it?  Hillary Clinton as secretary of state and the commander-in-chief, Barack Obama.Think about just two things, two data points that cannot be gainsaid. Number one, 2015 saw the highest number of jihadi plots on U.S. territory since September the 11th, the highest number!  This is when ISIS is meant to be on the ropes.And secondly, today in the world, we have the highest number of refugees in human history, more than 60 million refugees.  This is when the world's supposed to be great, and the president says to us today, go out and enjoy the sunshine and the birds.HANNITY:  You know -- Colonel, I'll go back to you.  I mean, he has been wrong all along.  They're not the JV team.  They were not contained before the Paris attack.  He said this -- Obama saying yesterday the world has never been less violent!You know, it seems on every -- giving the Iranians money.  Now they'll be able to build the bomb with our money in half the time, helping Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood when he was the head of Egypt with F-16s and tanks, a man that once referred to Jews as descendants of apes and pigs!How can you be this wrong this often on something this important?NORTH:  He has the bully pulpit, and he is -- either he is delusional or he's simply not reading his intelligence reports.HANNITY:  We know he doesn't.NORTH:  He gets a presidential daily brief every single day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  Radical Islamists have launched 1,000-plus terror attacks around the world with their 43 different affiliates in 34 countries.And you've got Iran and North Korea, as you just point out, colluding on nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them.  And the icon of the Obama foreign policy is to denigrate the only democratic ally in the Middle East, Israel.  It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever!HANNITY:  All right, Dr. Gorka, let me combine a military question and a political question.  If you can't identify -- and Donald Trump talked about this last night, and I thought the line that we just played about him taking on Hillary was just absolutely devastating, a legacy of death, destruction, terrorism and weakness.When you can't acknowledge radical Islam, you can't say the words and you come up with euphemisms, man-caused disasters, overseas contingencies, workplace violence, how can you possibly expect under Hillary Clinton it's going to get any better, considering it's gotten so bad under Obama and her?GORKA:  Imagine if it's 1941 and it's Pearl Harbor, and the people in power say in the White House, in the national security establishment, yes, Tojo and the emperor -- I guess their daddy didn't love them.  Yes, they need a hug.  They need more love.  Did we say that about Hitler?  Did we say that about the communists?  They're just unemployed.  They need a little bit of kumbaya.  Let's sing a song together with them.HANNITY:  No, no, no, no.  You got jobs for jihadis.  Don't forget.GORKA:  Jobs for jihadis, yes.  You would have been court-martialed if you'd said that.  In the cold war, you would have been fired.  Your feet would not have touched the ground if you'd said absurdities like that. Those absurdities are the actual narrative of the current administration upon which our policies are built.HANNITY:  All right, good to see you both.  Thank you.By the way, quick programming note for my friend Colonel Oliver North. Don't forget you can catch ""War Stories"" with Oliver North this Saturday starting at 10:00 PM Eastern on our sister network, the Fox Business Network.  Check your listings.Coming up next tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we're going to defeat them fast!BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The world has never been less violent, healthier, better educated, more tolerant.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  What the hell is he talking about?  Donald Trump last night said we got to defeat ISIS and do it expeditiously.  Obama -- the world's never been safer than today.  Really?  We'll debate that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA:  If you had to choose a moment in history to be born and you didn't know ahead of time who you were going to be, you'd choose now because the world has never been less violent, healthier, better educated, more tolerant, with more opportunity for more people and more connected than it is today.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  The world has never been less violent?  That's President Obama, of course, naively claiming that the world is safer now more than ever.Here with reaction tonight, the author of ""The Field of Flight,"" retired lieutenant general Mike Flynn, who joins us on the phone.Sir, how are you?  Thanks for being with us.  I want to get your reaction. Is that true, or is that a lie?LT. GEN. MICHAEL FLYNN, U.S. ARMY (RET.) (via telephone):  Yes, Sean, I just don't know what world the president is living in.  I mean, the president of the United States to continue to say what he's saying, he is doing a disservice to the American public about what is really happening not only in our own country, but around the world with this wry (ph) expansion and viciousness of radical Islam.I mean, this most recent attack -- and I know it's still unfolding.  This is a -- you know, a young Iranian kid, from what I can tell right now, with a German passport.  So we'll see what they find out in the forensics (INAUDIBLE) that they...HANNITY:  You know...FLYNN:  ... seize out of his home.  But yes.HANNITY:  General, I just played in the last segment a devastating takedown of the Obama/Clinton foreign policy.  And, you know, it's very interesting to watch media reaction.  Oh, that speech was dark.  They're very patronizing to the American people, because what I felt what was refreshing or most refreshing about the speech last night is that he actually told us the truth.  Millions more in poverty, millions more on food stamps, millions more out of work.  We're suffering.  We're taking on debt. Obamacare is not working.  We're not energy-independent.  And by the way, every location he mentioned around the globe is an absolute mess because of their incompetence.  And a politician can't fix it.  To me, telling the truth is not dark.  That actually sheds light.  FLYNN:  Yes.  Here's what I got out of that speech.  That speech was about leadership, American leadership not only at home but around the world.  And really that's sort of the big message.  The other thing is that, I mean, there's nothing dark about that.  For your listeners, Sean, you're talking about a speech that presented the truth. This is the truth as it is.  This is how the world is currently operating and acting and how we are not acting as a global leader that we should and really putting ourselves on firm ground to do that.  We have been inept and incompetent in many cases.  We have zero respect around the world in places where we used to just be the dominant player. And so all this business that's going on -- today in Germany is just another example of the kinds of things that are going on around the world.  Like I just said, the president of the United States is doing a disservice by not being very precisely clear about what it is that we are facing when it comes to this type of enemy, this radical Islamism.  And I don't know if that is what happened in Germany today, but I'm going to tell you, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck.  And they'll find out more about it in the next couple of days.   HANNITY:  All right, thank you, lieutenant general.  Good to see you this week, by the way, in Cleveland.  Thank you for being here.  Yes, crime is exploding in inner city in all cities, small towns in America.  Police, yes, they are being ambushed.  They are lying in wait to assassinate these cops.  Terrorists are slaughtering Americans.  It's in the news almost every day or around the world globally somewhere.  You have immigration is having a huge negative impact, preventing Americans from getting jobs.  On the one hand, it's not going for national security.  We're not energy independent.  We're still relying on countries that hate our guts.  You go through the list.  Oh, and by the way, you can't keep your doctor and your plan, and you're paying a lot more.  So, yes, things are not really better.  Here now with reaction, FOX News Middle East analyst and Trump foreign policy adviser Dr. Walid Phares, former NYPD detective, FOX News contributor Bo Dietl.  Bo is in the library somewhere in some big university by the looks of it.  Bo, on a serious note here, I mean, we've had you on a lot recently.  We're one of our go to guys on important issues involving crime and criminal justice and also terrorism.  And it seems like you're on every night now, not that we don't mind having you, because there's another event breaking every single day.  BO DIETL, FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE:  Sean, first of all, I want to thank you for getting me on tonight.  I listened to the president today when he said that Trump's speech was a lot of jive.  He used that expression ""jive"" twice.  In other words, the 50 percent of African-Americans in our inner cities who are unemployed, that's jive.  And 4,500 African-Americans are going to be killed this year by other African-Americans across the United States.  That's jive.  The cops are not killing those 4,500.  We've had 10 cops killed in the last two weeks.  That's jive.  HANNITY:  Let me play this.  I want -- you can finish.  Pick up out of it, but just to let people know.  By the way, he spoke for 34 minutes -- I'm sorry -- 34 seconds today on the terror attack in Munich, and 14 seconds later, he was laughing, telling jokes about his kids going off to college. And I'm thinking, really?  There might be a kid that was just killed in Munich.  Anyway, here's the comment Bo Dietl is referring to.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: This idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn't really jive with the experience of most people.  Just to be absolutely clear here that some of the fears that were expressed throughout the week just don't jive with the facts.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Reaction, Bo?  DIETL:  Sean, it doesn't jive.  You know what doesn't jive?  This man was able to get a great education in Harvard.  He's never held a job.  He was a community organizer.  He was a state senator for 15 seconds, a United States senator for another five seconds.  He becomes the president of the United States.  He's never ran a business.  He doesn't know what in the hell he's doing, and cops are dying around this country.  We have a division.  We have a race war going on and a division between the cops and our inner cities.  And what does he say?  This is jive.  This is not jive. We've got young kids dying.  I'll guarantee you tonight in Chicago a young African-American will be killed tonight.  That's jive, Mr. President?HANNITY:  That doesn't fit the narrative that goes through the prism of race that the president seems to always want to advantage.  He's ignored, what, 3,470 dead people in Chicago and barely mentions it.  You know, Dr. Phares, when he says the world has never been less violent, my 14-year-old daughter recognizes he's an idiot to say that because it's so obviously not true.  DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS MIDDLE EAST ANALYST:  Look, if you throw that sentence today in the world of Facebook, Twitter, or any of the social media, that would be a disaster.  Obviously the president is living on planet Obama, and then you have planet earth, and these are two different planets with two different news.  Basically the world today actually is living with the highest number of ethnic religious conflicts ever since the end of the Soviet Union, largest violence.  The west has never encountered an urban violence like the one we're living, including jihadists operating in at least 14 countries inside the west.  So I don't know where the facts are coming from.  HANNITY:  I don't know either.  All right, guys, scary.  We have you on so often.  Same topics, and he's telling us everything is safe.  The jayvee team, they're contained.  And of course the world has never been less violent.  I don't know what fantasy he's living in.  Anyway, coming up, Donald Trump literally railed against Hillary Clinton's corruption and the numerous scandals in his speech last night in Cleveland. We'll check in with Geraldo, Doug Schoen, Judge Jeanine Pirro.  They're here with reaction as we continue.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  And when a secretary of state illegally stores her e-mails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different forum, and faces no consequence, I know that corruption has reached a level like never, ever before in our country.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump slamming Hillary Clinton over her corruption and, of course, the many scandals, last night at the RNC.  Joining us now, former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen, the host of ""Justice,"" Judge Jeanine Pirro, and Fox News senior correspondent, I think he's out on his boat somewhere out in the Hamptons tonight -- wait a minute.  You're in the same room with Bo.  That means you two are together.  (LAUGHTER)GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  I'm hanging out with Bo.  HANNITY:  And you didn't invite any of us here.  We're really mad at both of you.  RIVERA:  And Arthur Aidala is waiting on the corner.  HANNITY:  Oh, boy.  It's probably better I'm not there.  Let's be honest.  All right, Judge, let me go to you.  The corruption issue with her is massive.  This is my take on the whole speech of Trump last night, and that is she's corrupt.  She's incompetent.  She's part of the problem that got us to this point.  She's made more money being in government.  She doesn't have solutions to fix it.  She caused the problems.  And, by the way, it's time for an outsider to do it.  Sums it up.  JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO, ""JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE"" HOST:  Look, that -- the statement last night by Donald Trump, that speech was brilliant.  It had heart and passion and facts, and it was smart.  HANNITY:  It was smart.  PIRRO:  And he connected, and he proved his case.  He laid out the facts, and every chance he got, he was able to weave in her incompetence, her ineptitude, or her lack of vision.  And that speech was phenomenal.  And I've got to tell you, Sean, I am so tired of people saying it was too long. It wasn't too long.  It was brilliant.  HANNITY:  I was in the room.  I was watching people.  They were captivated.  Doug, you even say as a result of how well this convention went, that Democrats should be very worried.   DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  Look, it was a very, very sound, logical speech with a clear view of the world.  The polls were within two points going into this speech.  I have to believe, Sean, after it that Trump will be either even or perhaps slightly ahead.  But most important is what Jeanine said.  There was a clear narrative.  And, look, with what happened today, yes, I'm a Democrat.  Yes, we disagree on a lot of things.  But we don't disagree --HANNITY:  How many events in the last month?  How many events in the last month?  SCHOEN:  That's what I was trying to say.  Three in the last eight days in Europe.  We've been hit here repeatedly, horrific incidents.  And where is the president saying we need to attack?  HANNITY:  But you can't deny the case that Trump prosecuted last night was stellar because he talked about ISIS, the emergence of ISIS in Syria and in Iraq and the Muslim Brotherhood and how he supported Mohamed Morsi.  He went through every single -- and then it ends with Clinton's legacy of death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.  Let me get to Geraldo who is out there in the Hamptons drinking with Bo.  Go ahead.  RIVERA:  You know, Sean, I think that Donald Trump did an excellent job last night with a very powerful speech.  I use the two words that you had not heard during the course of the evening, and I was alongside you as the speech was going on, ""muscular"" and ""macho.""  He really was, I think, very flamboyant, but he was also very strong in his presentation, and it was convincing.  However, there is no doubt -- here's the caveat.  There's no doubt but that he was wildly exaggerating when he talks about Hillary Clinton's e-mails as being the crime that wasn't prosecuted.  The Department of Justice examined the deleted e-mails and found no crimes there, judge.  (CROSSTALK)PIRRO:  Geraldo, what did he exaggerate about?  When the FBI had said that she had classified information that she sent and that she received and that there was some they couldn't even find.  RIVERA:  Judge, at what point do you look in the mirror -- at what point do you look in the mirror and see that beautiful face and say to yourself, wait a second.  The FBI has said --(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Hang on.  Don't forget Comey admitted she lied to us repeatedly, just like she did about Benghazi.  She's a liar, a pathological, congenital liar.  More with our panel right after this break.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to ""Hannity"" as we continue with Doug Schoen, Judge Jeanine Pirro, and Geraldo Rivera.  All right, I thought it couldn't have gone any better for Donald Trump this entire week.  His kids were unbelievable.  They are really special kids.PIRRO:  They are.HANNITY:  Yes, they really are.  Now, we're going to hear all the insanity, that Republicans are racist, sexist, anti-gay, homophobic.  And then Hillary makes this choice of Tim Kaine, and I can't imagine the 50,000 Bernie supporters that found out the DNC was colluding with Hillary and the campaign to trash him and the media are going to be too happy.  SCHOEN:  Let me speak as a Democrat.  I want Hillary to win.  I know you find that abhorrent.  But let me tell you why Tim Kaine helps your cause. He is pro free trade.  He is pro loosening regulations on banks, took $160,000 in gifts while lieutenant governor and governor from corporate interests.  She needs the Bernie voters.  She needs millennials.  This doesn't help.  Sherrod Brown was the right choice.  She made the wrong choice is a race that's now statistically tied.  PIRRO:  The only smart thing about it is he is from Virginia.  That is a swing state.  HANNITY:  I agree.  PIRRO:  But other than that, I don't think anybody cares.  I think the problem is that she needed to move left and instead she moved right with her choice.  HANNITY:  I agree.  She's assuming the Bernie people will come, and that's not going to happen.  Geraldo, what are you saying?RIVERA:  I think that Tim Kaine, not my first choice, but he is like the Democratic Mike Pence.  He's solid.  He's fine.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  There's no Mike Pence --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA:  May I?  I met him following the massacre at Virginia Tech.  He was the healer in chief for his state.  He was the governor, senator, mayor of Richmond.  (CROSSTALK)SCHOEN:  You've got to win elections to serve.RIVERA:  Excuse me, he's never lost an election, Doug.PIRRO:  That doesn't matter.  That doesn't affect people's vote.  They don't vote for the V.P.  The only thing it does.RIVERA:  May I make my sentence, please?  Tim Kaine speaks Spanish better than Ted Cruz speaks Spanish.  He wasn't my first choice.  Cory Booker would have been a much better choice.  But Tim Kaine will be fine, and he has the ability.  He is fluent in Spanish.  I will tell you when the time comes.  He is fluent in Spanish.  He can go to Spanish language media.  (CROSSTALK)RIVERA:  You guys, I think you guys need a drink here.  HANNITY:  Actually, Trump is doing better than Romney and McCain were at this point with the Hispanic vote.All right, unfortunately, that is all the time we have left.  As always, thank you for being with us.  Don't forget, Monday, broadcasting live from, I'll be suffering, I will suck it up for the audience.  I will go to the Democratic National Convention in Philly.  I will be hiding.  I have a lot of security.  Hope have you a great weekend.  The only great thing about Philly is the flyers and cheesesteaks.  We'll see you from Philly on Monday.  Thanks for being with us.     ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
