You know, forget what is right or wrong here, simple economic category and this has precedence, 1986, Ronald Reagan give amnesty to three million illegal. You saw an influx, record amount in the following years coming across the border. I grew up on a ranch. I grew up working on a ranch in sweet water, Texas, with illegals. But one of the reasons the ranchers could make money is they're able to pay such a low wage for the illegals. You add more illegals to that equation; it's just a matter of economics that you're going to keep wages artificially low for a very long time.Gary B. Smith: I agree. And look, john points out some good anecdotal evidence, but the fact of the matter is, immigration's effect on wages and plan has been studied since immigrants have been coming to the country. You can find some studies where wages go up 2 percent, some studies where wages come down 2 percent. If you took the consensus of all the studies, the net effect of immigrants is zero. The same with unemployment rates. If you looked at unemployment amongst immigrants and unemployment amongst Native Americans, it almost goes in lock step. You'd think just the opposite. Immigrants went up; unemployment of Native Americans went down. Part of the reason and everyone forgets is when immigrants come in the country, they come in as consumers. So they're spending more money increasing maybe not the prosperity of john's ranchers, but the prosperity in other industries, food services, retail, and things like that. So the net effect is almost zero.Suzy Welch: You know, there's been a long debate about the illegal immigrants, same say it's a wash, we've heard that already and some people say that the cost is up to $400 billion when it comes to education and hospitalizations and who knows who's right or wrong, even if you average these, there's net effect of zero and $400 billion, there is a cost, there is an economic cost, but you no e what, we're talking about the economic impact, i don't see this as an economic debate. We have two other bigger issues against me, one is that do we have a country with borders that mean anything and are we a nation of laws? I mean, there are definitely going to be economic impacts. But these issues seem bigger to me, and i think we need to think about those before we go to the economic impact.Jonas Max Ferris: I'm not going to disagree with the illegal legal part of it, a lot are working now, i don't know if making them legal is going to affect stuff, but these politicians, these candidates i should say, have pandered themselves into the most ridiculous flip-flop. If you own a business, to Gary's point, you want more customers and more labor. That's what you want. Lower the wages and raise the amount of customers, when you're in labor, you want less labor, less competition, that's the whole point of unions and what democrats typically want. Right now we want democrats saying they want more immigration and you have republicans saying we need less. That is completely the opposite of what businesses want and what labor wants, it's totally flip-flopped.Nomi Konst: Well, I think what they're trying to do, the programs that president Obama brought is they're trying to legalize, take these people out of the shadows. They still contribute $11.8 Billion in U.S. Taxes. State and local per year. You've got the possible by taking them out of the shadows, that's $230 billion a year. That's crazy. It's a crazy amount of money that'll go into our economy. You know 29,000 jobs a year. There's a huge economic impact by taking the people out of the shadows. We're going to talk about border problems? We have deported more people under president Obama than any other president in history. We don't have an influx of illegal immigrants anymore. It's actually negative, and more people going back to Mexico and the Dominican Republican right now because of the restrictions that have been set up at the border. I'm from Arizona, I've seen it, we have built an economy around protecting the border rather than around the shadows of immigrants.Apple, FBI Set to Face Off in Court Over San Bernardino Terrorist's PhoneGary B. Smith: Absolutely, Dagen. Look, in my opinion we're fighting a modern day World War called World War III 2.0 If you will. The FBI is trying to help the United States win that war at a minimum, be safe. Apple is critical to that. You know, in World War II, Dagen, the government conscripted entire industries to help us win the war. I think apple can do its part to help us out.Suzy Welch: Right. Well, look, true confession right up front. I see both sides of the debate and intellectually speaking, this is a war shack about how much you trust the government and sometimes I think I have nothing to hide, what do I care? And then I think, if Bernie Sanders gets elected, the IRS is going to find a reason to audit me because i whined about government regulation, but the noise many my head goes completely silent when i imagine the elementary school or the subway system that is blown to smithereens by one of the terrorists from the San Bernardino shootings. When they find that name in the San Bernardino shooters phone. And that is, that's what's coming. You know, that's the consequence of giving equal liberty to terrorists. Gary's right, we are at war with the terrorists and they do not deserve the prestige of good citizens. Apple needs to help out.John Layfield: And I think there's a reason, look, I don't trust the government with this information, but I am on the same side as all Americans as we are against ISIS and against terror attacks. But to Gary's point, declare war. There's a big difference in saying going after a person that is an alleged terrorist. This one's easy, black and white. Give him this phone, take it apart, figure out what's inside of it. What happens when you go down the line, its a slippery slope. I'm with apple on this. There's a month to break into this phone and fix the back door. Who's going to pay for that, by the way, the terrorist in Europe was caught because of an old gun shoot detective technique of a fingerprint of an apartment they raided.Nomi Konst: And I find telephone interesting because there's this culture in silicon valley, so on one hand, they don't to want answer to the government, you're there to protect us, we have a right to security in this country. Strangely enough, we don't have a right to privacy because, you know, you have the right to search and seizure, but what's going on with apple right now is that they're willing to sell information to companies, but they're not willing to give this information to the government. And you know, they're saying that if they open it up for the government, it's suddenly going to be open for hackers from other countries. You know, there has to be a way here, I think they're using games and that's why the president wants the south by southwest to recruit them and come to work for the government like they did in the forties and World War II.Jonas Max Ferris: They're telling us stuff we don't understand. It's all garbage anyway, I'm not for a back door that the government will snoop at will, but you're talking about making a legitimate request to a company. Let me tell you. It is easy to make the case, yeah, they should do it because of terrorism. Forget terrorism, every company in the world has to deal with government garbage. The tech industries are prima donnas. If you're an investment advisor, you come by all this stuff, it's called you're in business.New Calls for Presidential Candidates to Make Nation's Debt a PrioritySuzy Welch: Not any of these candidates they are not talking about it. The number is gigantic and it's scary and moving, but this election, nobody wants to talk about cutting the national debt because that's just another way about talking about cutting social security and Medicare and Medicaid and there's just too many voters who care about those things not being cut. And the candidates know it, but we're not going to hear about that until after the election and is that a good thing? Of course not, but politics doesn't bring out the truth in candidates, we all know that.Gary B. Smith: Absolutely. I'm afraid we're on the fast path to that crisis. We are third in the world in terms of debt to tax revenues. We're only, we have 408 percent in that number. You know where we're behind, we're only behind Greece and Japan. My gosh. We're being compared with Greece for crying out loud you look at all major empires, decline, one of the reasons is debt, and we're on the road to decline.Nomi Konst: Listen, we all know that presidential candidates, campaign and poetry, hopefully government, some don't, some do, the past four or five presidents, each presidents has had their own version of increasing the debt, whether it's increasing social security, growing Medicare and Medicaid or the defense budget. This is why a lot of republicans are frustrated. The establishment hasn't responded to their needs, whether it's their income.Jonas Max Ferris: These programs grow themselves at this point. You don't need to vote to increase them. The election year is about giving, and I will say, we saw a little bit of talk about not giving the tax cuts we candidate afford or spending we can't afford. Kasich talks about it, he's not doing well. How about the guy on the republican side who has a one year out with the social security, boom, he's gone. We don't talk about cutting these programs and you want to get elected.John Layfield: Sure it is. And poetry, I've never heard more banter in my entire life. It's like they're running for sixth grade student council. It's unbelievable. We'll be about $30 trillion in debt. That's not worst case, that's based upon the democrats and republicans budget. That is what we are on track for. That is on average interest rate a trillion and a half dollars a year. We will spend on interest alone, put that into our country. This is a huge thing that no one's talking about.Stock PicksGary B. Smith: (HD) Home Depot 20 percent gains by the end of the yearJohn Layfield: (VZ) Verizon up 20 percent in 1 yearJonas Max Ferris: (GT) Goodyear up 50 percent in 1 year"	['Sanders', 'Obama', 'Kasich']	[]

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, Donald Trump unveils another policy proposal. He'll join us in just a minutes to explain.But first, the GOP nominee was in Pennsylvania earlier tonight with his daughter, Ivanka, laying out his agenda for child care and family leave. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)IVANKA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER: Raising children full-time is one of the hardest jobs anyone can do, and it's essential that our policies recognize and honor that reality. As an employer, a mother and a woman who works both inside and outside the home, these are topics I consider of critical importance.The policy my father is about to outline is one that I'm proud to have helped conceptualize, and ensuring its enactment will be one of my top priorities when he's elected come November.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: My opponent has no child care plan. She never will. And if it ever evolves into a plan, it'll never get done anyway. All talk, no action.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Many Americans are just one crisis away from disaster, a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home. There is no financial security in our country, especially anymore. But that will change under our pro-family, pro -- you just take a look. It's pro-family, it's pro-child, it's pro-worker. These are the people we have to take care of, and this is what I am going to be outlining tonight.The first part of my child care plan allows for every parent or family in America, including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians, to deduct their child care expenses from their income taxes. That's a first.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes. It's a big thing. For low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit -- that's EITC -- in the form of a child care rebate.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax, a major relief for low-income parents.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And here now with much more is 2016 Republican presidential nominee -- Donald Trump is with us. Sir, how are you?TRUMP: Very good. Thank you, Sean.HANNITY: You know, I know you're close to your family, but you really gave Ivanka a lot of credit in terms of pointing out to you the importance of this child care issue. Explain.TRUMP: Well, it's true. During the time that I've been running, and especially lately since the polls have been so good and people are saying, Wow, this could really happen, I've been just inundated with so many women and families that have me to do something having to do with child care.And I felt this for a long time, but I guess maybe we weren't in quite the same position we're in right now. And my daughter has felt so strongly, and she's been talking to me about it for a long period of time, long before the campaign started. Let me tell you, she always thought it was unfair to moms and to families.And you know, it's one of the biggest costs of a family. In many cases, it's the single biggest cost for a family. So we unveiled a plan, and I think it's something that really has been well received, as you've probably heard.HANNITY: Yes, and you're talking about current child care policies that, as you talk about, hold women back, and your plan is going to help with the cost, excluding the cost from taxes and allowing family choice, incentivizing employers. You said, yes, it's one of the biggest issues, biggest costs.Is the government in that sense penalizing moms right now?TRUMP: Oh, right now, they are. I mean, right now, moms don't know what to do. They're besides (sic) themselves. They can't do anything. And you know, you mentioned the word incentive and you mentioned the word choice.  We have sort of everything in there. And it's going to be a great thing.  I think the moms and families -- it's, you know, beyond anything, families are going to really going to see something very special here, Sean.HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: And we've spent a lot of time on it. This is complex stuff. We spent a lot of time on it. But it's something where they're going to really be tremendous beneficiaries. And the children are going to be the big beneficiaries, when you get right down to it. But the families and the moms are very happy.HANNITY: You know, a lot of times, you have explained to me that you want to eliminate ""Obama care"" and you want choice and you want competition.TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: And you like health savings accounts as part of your proposal.TRUMP: I do.HANNITY: And you're talking about child care savings accounts. So you're really talking about bringing in the free market here and incentivizing from the tax so it's not going to cost as much in terms of government money. Is that correct??TRUMP: Well, that's true. And frankly, they can have some money left over when the child reaches a certain age. And you know, they have money left over and they can use that for college. They can use it for what they have to use it for. And it's like -- it's incredible, what this does. And it's going to be great for our government. It's going to be great for families.  It's going to be great for, I think, everybody. There's just no down side.HANNITY: Let me talk about Hillary's health, and while we're talking about it, I'm going to play a slow motion of her from Sunday, where she's being walked to her vehicle, leaving early. You can see an aide is holding her.  Then as she stumbles, a Secret Service gent, it looks like, grabs her other arm, and then she totally collapses.Her -- she admits that she has collapsed -- last night, she admitted a few times before. Her campaign is claiming that except for pneumonia, she's completely healthy. It took them a long time to get to the pneumonia excuse.Polls show today that, in fact, you know, most voters actually doubt she's telling us the truth about it. DNC is planning to meet to consider Hillary's replacement. Cokie Roberts and Don Fowler, former DNC chair, said, Hey, people are talking about maybe replacing her.What is your overall view of her health, the DNC, her as a candidate as it relates to her health?TRUMP: I really have no view. I just hope she gets better and she can get back out. I just -- I have no view. You know, I just don't want to get involved with it. I hope she's going to be fine and she'll continue onward.We're doing well, and you know, I enjoy the competition. And we have a big debate coming up in two weeks, as you probably have heard. A couple of people have heard about that one. That's going to be a biggie and...HANNITY: Yes, no, I think we...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I think we read about it somewhere.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: I think this is going to be bigger than any pay-per-view event.TRUMP: You might have heard.HANNITY: I might have heard. I'm just in the news business.TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: What the hell do I know. I know. I want to hold up this for.  It was on my -- our sister network, FOX Business. This is Hillary -- every X represents a day that she had off in August. I can't think of a day that you didn't even have a rally or a day that you actually took off. Maybe you did. But that's a lot of days.What do you -- you know, you once said that Jeb Bush was low energy. With that schedule, she's making Jeb Bush look like the Energizer Bunny.TRUMP: Well, I can only speak for myself. We are going from early in the morning until late in the evening. I get home sometimes at 1:00 o'clock in the morning. I get -- you know, oftentimes just stay over in different locations.And I thought I would have Sunday off for the first off time in a long time, months. And I just found out we're doing a rally on Sunday, and I think it's going to be in Pennsylvania. I hope it's going to be in Pennsylvania because we're doing really well there. We have, like, a great opportunity, I think, in Pennsylvania. So we'll see what happens. But in any event, we're not having any time off.And you know, it's really a dart to the finish. We'll see what happens, but it's a dart to the finish. And the polls have gone up amazingly well.  You see the kind of numbers that are coming out. And people are liking what we have to say, and I think we're going to be victorious. We'll see on the 8th, November 8th.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: You're right, you got 56 days left. I mean, we're in the end stretch here. How -- let me stay on the health issue for a second. You said you're going to take a complete physical and reveal that. Hillary last night was complaining you didn't reveal your taxes...TRUMP: I've actually done that.HANNITY: And you're going to reveal more. OK. And -- but on the other hand she's given all these speeches to all these Wall Street firms and insurance firms, and she won't release the text of those speeches.What do you think is most important for the public to have in terms of what should be revealed by candidates?TRUMP: Well, I think her speeches are important, but I think her email are much more important. 33,000 email were deleted and acid washed and the machines, the iPhones or whatever she was using, were whacked, and you know, destroyed with hammers.I would say there's something going on there. So I always put the 33,000 plus 15,000 more that they found, but all of these thousands and thousands of emails, definitely. That's number one by a factor of 20. And also, I think the speeches would be revealing.But you know, I have given, as you probably have heard many times and as you know, the FEC tremendous -- about 100 pages worth of documents that spell out things very strongly as far as financials are concerned -- many, many companies, I guess close to 500 companies, tremendous, tremendous liquidity, tremendous values in terms of just about any way you can look at it -- cash flows. You know, it's a great company. I built a great company.You learn much more from that than you learn from a -- believe me, thank you learn from a tax return. You really learn very little from a tax return.Now, I'm being audited. It's a routine audit. I've been audited for every year I think for 15 or 16 years, which I think is unfair because I have friends that are very rich and they don't get audited. I get audited every year.But I have a routine audit going, and when that's completed, I'll release.  But until that time, I'm not going to do that. I'd be (INAUDIBLE) to do that.HANNITY: But it seems that there's a strategy that has emerged by the Clintons. I mean, if 55 percent of the individuals she met as secretary of state -- when that AP article came out, immediately, the ad came out claiming you were a member of the Klan, et cetera, even saying ""Make America great""...TRUMP: Can you imagine that one.HANNITY: Yes. Yes. OK. And then even making America great...TRUMP: Can you imagine that one? Yes.HANNITY: Bill Clinton is saying...TRUMP: It's vicious.HANNITY: It seems that every time she gets in trouble -- and this was the -- this was where the whole ""basket of deplorables"" comments come in. I wanted to get you to talk about that. You brought your supporters on stage yesterday to say, Excuse me, you're calling us deplorable? Why do you think she's doing that?TRUMP: When she said ""basket of deplorable,"" I couldn't -- you couldn't even believe it. I'll tell you what. I heard the whole thing and I said, I don't believe it. And then I said, Run it back, let me hear it. I thought it was so terrible a statement to make.And I called up some people. I said, Did she really say that, and is it as bad as I think? And they said, No, Mr. Trump, it's worse. And they really -- all of a sudden, the Twittersphere went crazy, as you know, and you went crazy and everybody on television went wild.HANNITY: Thanks a lot!TRUMP: Even people that are...HANNITY: I love being told I'm crazy.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Well, I meant crazy in the sense, obviously. But no no. I understand that. A lot of people are in that basket, and a lot of people in that basket, it's very unfair. It's a horrible characterization. And even people that support her say, Wow, what a mistake.And you know that was her 47 percent moment. I think it was far worse. I mean, frankly, I think this was far worse. And let's see what happens.  But there are a lot of very angry people. We have people right now that I'm going to be seeing in a little while, a roundtable, and they're very upset. I mean, people are really upset that she would feel that way because, you know, that's really her true feeling, you understand. That's her true feeling.HANNITY: She revealed it. And this is my question. A follow-up to that is, she said they're redeemable, a percentage of them, but she also said this is racism and sexism and homophobia and Islamophobia and xenophobia.And I'm thinking, Now, wait a minute. Isn't this same Hillary Clinton that took money from the UAE and Oman and Kuwait and the Saudis. The Saudis, for example, treat women horribly. They put gays and lesbians to death.  They persecute Christians and Jews. She took tens of millions of dollars between the library and the foundation. She's never criticized them. And the very thing that she is accusing you of I would argue she's guilty of.  Do you agree with that?TRUMP: Well, I think that her statements really speaks for itself. There is no justification. She tried to apologize, and the apology wasn't a very good one. It probably got her into more trouble. It's been a really bad statement, I think probably the worst in the political season of anybody, and that includes a lot of different people that tried to run for office and started to run for office. It was a bad statement.HANNITY: And when we come back, I'll have more with Donald Trump.And also later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It is something that has occurred a few times over the course of my life. And you know, I'm aware of it.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Hillary Clinton raising new concerns about her health after saying she's gotten dizzy and passed out a few times. Our medical A-team experts will join us next with reaction. Plus, a shocking report reveals Clinton's staff did not take her to the hospital on Sunday because, well, they wanted to keep her illness from you, the American people.We'll have all the details and much more tonight right here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hard-working American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.It's this attitude of arrogance that explain why Hillary Clinton made 13 phones disappear, including with a hammer, so the FBI couldn't see them and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena. That's after the subpoena came. This isn't before. That's after the subpoena came.This is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multi-million-dollar pay-for-play scheme between the secretary of state and her foundation. Whether it's her emails, her disasters in Iraq, Libya and Syria, or her failures on the economy, of which it's been disastrous, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment, temperament and moral character to lead this country. She does. You know it. Everybody knows it.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, that was Donald Trump going after Hillary Clinton at a rally in Iowa earlier today, and we continue now with the 2016 Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.Let me ask you about the polls. The UPI, LA Times has you up by 3 nationally. It seems like every single state that matters is now highly competitive, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Iowa, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina.As you look at these swing states and look at the polls, you have cut her margin in the RealClearPolitics average by -- you know, by 7 points. It's now a 2-point race, a statistical dead heat. It's a statistical dead heat in the swing states.What do you see happening on the ground, and how do you convert those into your states?TRUMP: Well, right now, I'm in Pennsylvania, and I'll tell you, the crowds we're getting here are unbelievable. But everywhere. In Ohio, we're doing record crowds, literally record crows. Florida, I think we're 4 or 5 points up, I'm hearing, and we're going to spend a lot of time in Florida, I've already spent, and it's my second home. We're doing really well in Florida, and doing pretty well everywhere. New Hampshire, we're even.  Iowa, we're doing great. Just left Iowa. We're 4 points up in Iowa.So I think we are really going and working very hard. And you know, I'm sometimes making four and five stops a day and sometimes six. And during those stops, I'm making speeches for the most part. And it's -- it's been pretty amazing. It's been a lot of fun, actually. A lot of work but a lot of fun.HANNITY: You know, I want to ask you this. Tell us -- walk us through your debate prep. You said you're not standing next to some stranger at a podium and practicing. And I don't know if that's the right thing for you to do anyway. You've done enough interviews. You know where you stand on the issues.How important do you view these debates? And bring us inside Donald Trump's prep for the debates because I would argue Hillary has one goal.  Hillary wants to piss you off. She wants to aggravate, agitate, irritate, upset and hurt your feelings and make you mad so then she can say, See? He doesn't have the temperament to be president. Do you agree with that?TRUMP: Well, I don't think she has the temperament, and I've been saying it for a long time. I don't think she's fit to be president, and I certainly don't think she has the temperament. And look, we're going to have debates. We'll see how it goes. I frankly would like to have no anchor or moderator because...HANNITY: I like that idea.TRUMP: ... I think it's all games. You know, we had a skirmish the other day on NBC, and I thought Matt Lauer did an excellent job, but he was criticized horribly because everyone said and all the polls said -- even the NBC poll said I won that debate, or whatever you want to call it. I guess it was a forum, a town hall forum, and they all said I won.And because of that, they went after Matt. And that means that whoever is hosting now -- in this case, it's Lester Holt, who I think, hopefully, would be fair, but I think there's so much pressure on him.And I really believe that it's very unfair what they're doing because they're gaming the ref, so to speak. You know, like Bobby Knight, who's the greatest -- if Bobby Knight would be screaming at the referee all night, and then all of the sudden, in the last play, the referee won't make the bad call against him.So you know, they have a real system going. And I think it's unfair. I don't want to have a moderator. I want to just sit on the stage...HANNITY: I think it'd be a great idea. It's be very interesting.TRUMP: ... (INAUDIBLE) talk and do whatever. You know, Lincoln did that with Douglas. That was a pretty good debate, so...HANNITY: Yes, I think...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: ... so they say. But I didn't quite make it. I would have loved to have seen it.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: By the way, that would get maybe better ratings than this one.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: It actually may. I think your...TRUMP: That might top it.HANNITY: That might top it. Is there anything that she will say -- if you agree with me she's going to try and aggravate you, is there anything that she could say that you wouldn't be prepared for that would irritate you?TRUMP: I don't know. Honestly, I don't know what she's going to do. I don't know what her attitude is going to be. I will treat her with great respect unless she treats me, you know, in a certain manner, in which case, that will be the end of that.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: But I'm certainly starting off with the -- you know, the feeling that I'm going to treat her with great respect, which is -- you know, I hope we can talk about policy and talk about certain things. I am not looking to go in and treat her with disrespect.HANNITY: Well, I would argue she can't talk about her record. She can't talk about Obama's economic record. So that leaves the personal.Mr. Trump, always good to see you. Thank you for being with us.TRUMP: Thank you very much, Sean.HANNITY: And up next, tonight right here on ""Hannity""...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why keep it a secret?CLINTON: Well, I just didn't think it was going to be that big a deal.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Really, just a little pneumonia, wasn't a big deal. Why talk about that? Anyway, Hillary claims the reason she kept this pneumonia diagnosis a secret from you, the American people, is, well, she didn't think it was a big deal. Our medical experts are here with reaction.  That's next.This and more tonight as ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" Now, Hillary Clinton is getting slammed by pundits and even some in the mainstream media for trying to hide her pneumonia from you, the American people. So why is Hillary Clinton being so secretive about her health, and maybe even lying?Well, during a phone interview, Clinton said that she just didn't think it was a big deal. Really? Collapsing, not a big deal? Pneumonia? Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know you passed out, hit your head back in 2012, which led to the concussion. How often has this happened?CLINTON: Oh, I think really only twice that I can recall. You know, it is something that has occurred a few times over the course of my life. And you know, I'm aware of it. I could, you know, feel how hot and humid it was. I felt overheated. I decided that I did need to leave.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why keep it a secret?CLINTON: Well, I just didn't think it was going to be that big a deal.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Here now with analysis, FOX News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel, as well as podiatric surgeon and former research fellow at Georgetown University, Dr. Kelly Powers. Good to see you both.All right, now, we do know last night, she admitted she collapsed, not once but a few times. All right, that's not normal. Now, she told the FBI that, in fact, she couldn't even remember being briefed because of a concussion that she suffered. That would be a pretty severe concussion if you can't remember a briefing about cybersecurity, right?DR. KELLY POWERS, PODIATRIC SURGEON: That's right.HANNITY: Now, they talked about -- we know that she's on an anti- coagulant. And that's known as coumadin, prescribed often. We know they said it was deep vein thrombosis, but it's really more than that. Isn't it more venal (sic) cerebral thrombosis as it was below the right ear?  Wouldn't that be a more accurate description? And that was all made public?POWERS: So Sean, there's no doubt that she has an extensive medical history. There's a lot going on here for over a decade. She has a history of two (ph) DVT, a CVT, which is what you're referring to, the cerebral venous thrombosis.HANNITY: Right.POWERS: And which can cause memory loss, confusion, dizziness, the same symptoms as a concussion, which is -- which is strange because, you know, you're looking at this differential diagnosis. It could be a CVT. It could be the concussion. You know, there's obviously a lot going on with her medical health.HANNITY: And we know she's had blood clotting and we know -- would you cause this a cerebral vascular collapse? Somebody used that phrase today.  Would that be a fair...POWERS: You know, it's -- it is really hard to speculate. Again...HANNITY: It's possible, though.POWERS: The whole issue here is that her medical records...HANNITY: She collapsed, though.POWERS: ... aren't out there.HANNITY: She lost all control and collapsed. Fair statement?POWERS: It looks like she was...HANNITY: Collapsed.POWERS: ... something was happening on that video where she (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: Come on. I'm playing the video. She collapses! Dr. Siegel?DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: I want to say this. 2012, she had a severe blow to the head, serious concussion. She had the blood clot, sinus venous thrombosis, transverse sinus thrombosis, actually.She was put on lifetime coumadin. Whatever is causing her to fall, Sean, and possibly black out -- and I look at that video. It is a video. I don't have her in person. I wasn't there. It looks to me like she either fainted or almost fainted.But here's the point.HANNITY: She certainly collapsed.SIEGEL: Certainly -- I think probably fainted. Here's the point. If you're fainting, you can hit your head. And if you hit your head and you're on blood thinners, you could have a bleed. I'm not saying any of those things are going to happen, but that's one of the main reasons --(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Listen, I got my bell rung a lot. I was a hockey player. We didn't have helmets the way they do today. And you know, I know what it's like to be knocked out. I know what it's like to have a concussion. I know what it's like to have my bell rang.And I'm thinking, OK, but I remember everything that happened. I mean, do you think that was an excuse, what she said to the FBI?SIEGEL: I don't know whether that was an excuse or not. But again, in 2008, we went after John McCain with a witchhunt saying he had a melanoma.  How do we know he won't have another one as president? The media demanded...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... was one in four chances of surviving eight years!SIEGEL: Exactly! So everyone was putting him in the grave before he -- and here he is running for senator again at 80!But here's the point, Sean. I thought we had established a criteria. I call it in The Wall Street Journal the McCain protocol. If you're 70 or more or you have a significant health history, you have to pony up your entire health records and at least select members of the media or an independent board of physicians gets to review it! Why shouldn't we have that now?HANNITY: Hey, listen, they're are all Dr. Feel-goods out there, too. With all respect to your profession, if you want to find a doctor that's going to give you the painkillers, is going to give you the anti-anxiety medicine, that's going to give you want you want, you're going to get it.  If you want the doctor that's going to say, Oh, he's healthy when you're not for an insurance policy, I guess you can go doctor shopping for that, too.But here's the thing. If she has all of these incidents, where -- you know, venal (sic) cerebral thrombosis, then we've got the coumadin, then we've got the concussion, then we've got all these other issues, the coughing, the collapse, I'm -- is this a neurological issue?POWERS: Well, I think that a neurological workup is absolutely paramount.  That's definitely what needs to be done. Besides releasing all the medical records, neurological workup for sure, 100 percent.HANNITY: Her campaign says except for pneumonia she's fine.SIEGEL: By the way, pneumonia, I have to tell you. Everyone is saying I have pneumonia, you have pneumonia. When I see pneumonia, I have to check a chest x-ray.HANNITY: If it's bacterial pneumonia, it can kill you.SIEGEL: Yes. This seems to be a mild case, but nobody should be waving off pneumonia, especially an elderly person.HANNITY: If you got a call from any of your patients that somebody with this history that we're discussing here had a collapse like this, would you recommend a hospital? Would that be 100 percent --POWERS: Yes, 100 percent.HANNITY: -- protocol? It's 100 percent?POWERS: I wasn't there. You go to the hospital.SIEGEL: It would tend to be my standard of care as well. Yes, right away.HANNITY: If it was me, I would -- anybody I knew, I would take them straight to the hospital. It's not normal for people to collapse.POWERS: Better safe than sorry.HANNITY: And it was 77 degrees and breezy. It wasn't hot.SIEGEL: Especially if you had pneumonia on Friday and you collapse and black out on Sunday. You go to the ER and get looked at.POWERS: And again, her DVT history, she has had extensive blood clot history. DVTs It can lead to a pulmonary embolism.HANNITY: Is there a chance she might have had a TIA, a stroke in her history? Is there a chance that there's something else neurologically going on? For example, WikiLeaks had the research into some drugs that can be used for Parkinson's. Is that a possibility? MS a possibility?POWERS: Sean, all of this is a possibility. The point is we don't have her medical records. We don't know. We don't have a neurological workup.  It's hard to speculate.SIEGEL: What I would emphasize here is that she's hit her head before.  She has a blood clot. She's on lifetime Coumadin. She's now having fainting spells, dehydration. There's something is going on here, something underlying that would make me want to see her records, possibly examine someone like that, but certainly her records.HANNITY: If you had to guess based on what you know, your best guess?SIEGEL: I don't guess. I'm not going to guess.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: A shocking report for ""The New York Post"" actually reveals that after Hillary collapsed on Sunday her campaign, they didn't want to take her to the hospital, all in an effort and attempt to hide her condition from you, the public.And also tonight --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My wife and I represent non-deplorable people.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump, he responds to Hillary Clinton's ""basket of deplorables"" comment by bringing his supporters on stage. That and more tonight as we continue straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So The New York Post ran an article entitled, quote, ""The Clinton team avoided ER to conceal details of her medical treatment."" Now, that's not all. According to a reporter on the Hill, members of the Clinton camp are not happy over all of the secrecy, saying, quote, ""One ally described the string of events that culminated in Clinton leaving a September 11th memorial early as, quote, ""self-inflicted expletive nightmare.""Here with reaction, former White House press secretary for George W. Bush Ari Fleischer, and Trump campaign senior adviser A.J. Delgado. It is interesting, Ari. In a lot of ways there is some truth to that, but I think it's deeper than that. I think like everything else with the Clintons, you can't trust them. They're not honest. They're not forthcoming. And I sense that her health issues go a lot further than what they're tell us publicly. Thoughts?ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I'm not in a position to know what her health problems are. But I would say that if she did have something where it was serious enough, the Secret Service training is to take her immediately to medical care. And they have a pre-designated spot to take her.HANNITY: They did. It was Bellevue hospital. But she overrode them.FLEISCHER: That's what we'll never get to the bottom of, whether that's true or not, whether she could override them or her staff did. But I strongly suspect if she had been passed out in the car, there is not way that the Secret Service would have allowed themselves to be overrode.HANNITY: Ari, look at this video. She collapsed. She literally fell. If they didn't prop her up.FLEISCHER: That's absolutely true.HANNITY: That is.FLEISCHER: The question is if she was passed out in the car, the Secret Service would have overrode everybody on the staff and taken her to the hospital.HANNITY: To me it's a distinction without a difference, though, because if she collapses, she collapses.FLEISCHER: OK. Now, let's talk about that, what happened on the outside of the car. The press coverage of this, Sean, has been absolutely ridiculous. They're using every word they can, ""Helped into the vehicle,"" ""She was unsteady."" If it wasn't for the people there, she would have collapsed on the ground. Instead she collapsed into the arms of the Secret Service and the staff. I don't know why they won't use the word ""collapse.""What bothers me the most about these things is there seems to be a protective cocoon too many in the media put up with their word usage. And we all know if that video hadn't come out, none of us would be here talking about it because none of us would know about it.HANNITY: A.J., look, I think this goes to the heart of one of Donald Trump's biggest arguments, crooked Hillary, lying Hillary. The narrative plays out almost every day almost now.A.J. DELGADO, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Right, dishonesty, the lack of transparency. This is a recurring theme we see. What happened, it's not so much her health as it is the cover-up. First they said it was overheating and then they said it was pneumonia. They're not giving it to us straight. They're not releasing the medical records. They're not releasing her Wall Street speech transcripts that people have been asking for for months. We still don't know exactly who donated to the Clinton Foundation. It's just a recurring pattern of dishonesty and a lack of transparency.HANNITY: If anybody you knew that was 68-years-old with her history, which is fairly comprehensive in terms of a health history, I mean, the deep vein thrombosis was actually venous cerebral thrombosis because it happened, you know, below her right ear, so this is a cognitive issue, a neurological issue in many ways. I don't think that any such person -- and then also one who has pneumonia that collapsed. The only reason I can think of her not wanting to go to the hospital is because she would have to reveal the truth about her medical condition.DELGADO: And isn't that something that the American public deserves to know? We saw this John McCain and how the media treated him and his health.HANNITY: They predicted he'd be dead, chances of survival.DELGADO: They said it was one in three.HANNITY: One in four.DELGADO: Matt Damon on TV going the odds are he's going to drop dead in office. I'm just telling it like it is. Check the tables. So why is this not on issue that the American public has a right to know? We keep hearing about Donald Trump's taxes. That's not going to affect me. What is going to affect me is whether Hillary Clinton has the strength and the stamina to put in this very hard work for the next four years if elected.George W. Bush was in phenomenal shape. He could run mile after mile after mile. He worked out regularly. He's a very aggressive biker out on the bike trails. If you were with him and he collapsed like that, I suspect knowing you as well as I do that you would have insisted on the hospital.FLEISHER: Well, it did happen. He collapsed in the absolute privacy watching a Miami Dolphins football game in the playoffs, January of 2002 eating a pretzel. He passed out, hit his head, and fainted. Nobody had to know about it. But within minutes I got a phone call from Andy Card, the chief of staff. He told me about it. The president then called me. It was a Sunday afternoon. It happened at 5:30. And before 8:00 was even hit I organized a press conference telephone call and I had the White House physician on the phone with everybody, with all of the press.HANNITY: Because you're actually honest and you're actually truthful, and he doesn't have underlying medical conditions in that particular case.  That was just an unfortunate accident.FLEISHER: But nobody would have known about it, probably, but it was still the instinct of the White House you have to reveal, you need to say, we should and we did. Now, there's always pressure, there's always strain on the candidates. And she when these strains happen --HANNITY: She took off more days in August than she worked, Ari. With all due respect I work 10 times harder than her. You know, I know that Donald Trump said that Jeb Bush was low energy. Compared to her, he seems like the energizer bunny.FLEISHER: My point is that every time she faces a fork in the road she takes the wrong fork. She goes for secrecy. She has this penchant to do it. And it's hurting her. She's turning what could have been a nothing health issue into an honesty issue, and that's where she's always vulnerable.HANNITY: And by the way, A.J. is now with the Trump campaign.DELGADO: I am. It's a great honor. Thank you.HANNITY: And up next tonight right here on ""Hannity"" --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My wife and I represent non-deplorable people.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump brings his supporters on stage to hit back against Hillary Clinton's ""basket of deplorables"" comment, that and more tonight on ""Hannity"" straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: These are not deplorable people, that I can tell you. Come on over.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My wife and I represent non-deplorable people.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As a black female American, I say let's get out and support Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am a wife, a mother, I work full time, and I am voting for Donald Trump. And Mrs. Clinton, you can go home.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm a pastor.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, we need to pray for and vote for the next president of the United States of America, Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump at a rally in North Carolina bringing some of his supporters on stage who Hillary Clinton, of course, labeled a ""basket of deplorables"" late last week. Here with reaction, FOX News contributor Ric Grenell and the senior pastor, he's actually my pastor now, and I'm going to preach from the pulpit of his church, of course with the New Spirit Revival Center, CEO for the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, Reverend Darrell Scott. Reverend, that's going to be the worst Sunday.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: You might lose all of your parishioners after that, but I'm going to bring it straight from the heart.REV. DARRELL SCOTT, NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP: It is going to hit you, and then you're just going to bring it, and God is going to move, I promise you.HANNITY: OK, but I'm deplorable. By the way, all have sinned and fallen short, so I guess we can make the case that everybody is deplorable, but that includes her irredeemable husband because she used that term as well.  But she really used it to say people are racist and sexist and homophobic, the same garbage we've been hearing now for weeks. What are your thoughts?SCOTT: Well, all of the racism and the vile and the venom and the insults that I've received during the course of this campaign have come from Hillary supporters. She found herself at a fundraiser. She relaxed and let her guard down, and her real feelings came out. But truth be told, man, honest to God, she's the one who is deplorable. Her lies are deplorable. Her health seems to be deplorable. Benghazi was deplorable.  The email scandal is deplorable. What the DNC did to Bernie Sanders is deplorable. In fact, the whole darn campaign is deplorable.HANNITY: And it's full of hate, too. She just lies with abandon.Rick, I thought liberals were the tolerant groups. Don't they always claim that they have a monopoly on compassion? I was listening to her talk about sexist and misogyny and racist, and I'm thinking, wait a minute, you're describing the countries that treat women horribly, that kill gays and lesbians, that persecute Christians and Jews, and you take millions from them and don't criticize them. So I was thinking guilty as charged to herself.RIC GRENELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Look, we have a real problem with liberal intolerance. And I think what Hillary Clinton did, just did, by calling millions of Americans deplorable, what she is doing is she's saying that millions of people who have a different political view than what she has should be rejected. And isn't that the definition of being intolerant?  Here we have a candidate, Hillary Clinton was telling us that she was going to be the uniter. Just two weeks ago she delivered this speech where everything was going to be positive. She wasn't going to take the low road. And then she's one who fingers tens of millions of people and says because I disagree with your political decision, you're deplorable. I think this is a big problem for her politically. She cannot outrun. This is going to be a commercial over and over.HANNITY: But Pastor, you know, Obama did the same thing when talked about people from the Midwest, you know, clinging to God, guns, their bible, religion, and the people of the Midwest still voted for him in Pennsylvania.SCOTT: That seems to be the modus operandi of the Democratic Party that whoever is not in agreement with them, they slander, they insult, they degrade, they denounce. And then they feign innocence when the do it. I mean, Hillary Clinton campaign today has been trying to put comments into that washing machine and try to spin it and clean it up. And now, they're trying to identify this deplorable segment of society. You know, they're asking the Trump supporters, they're asking Mike Pence, do you think this one is deplorable, do you think that one is deplorable? You can't clean this up. The Bible says ""Out of the abundance of a man's heart that mouth speaks."" She spoke out of her heart, and that's the way she feels about anybody that doesn't support her.HANNITY: Rick, we'll give you the last ward.GRENELL: Yes. Look, I have a real problem with this growing intolerance from the left because it's an issue that we all look at and we think we're American. We're supposed not to be pushed into identity politics. Our leaders in Washington D.C. are not supposed to tell us that we all are in different boxes and they take us out to parade us around, and then put us back in these boxes.At the same time, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are trying to say we are one America but their language is extremely divisive. It's identity politics at its worst and we know where it comes from. It's not going to be something that benefits Hillary politically.HANNITY: Guys, thank you. Pastor, you sure you want to give that pulpit to me?SCOTT: We're going to have a wonderful time that day.HANNITY: Are you sure you're going to hand that pulpit over to me? Are you sure you want to do that?SCOTT: Wait a minute, I heard you got an honorary doctorate of divinity from Liberty University.HANNITY: That's absolutely true.SCOTT: Then bring it then.  HANNITY: I won't be shy, I'll you that. All right, thank you all.We need your help. When we come back, a very important question of the day is straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right, time for our ""Question of the Day."" So do you think Hillary Clinton is being completely honest for lying about her health? Let me think. Hillary, honest or lying? I'll go with the odds on favorite, lying. But we want to hear from you. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.Unfortunately that is all the time we have this evening. Thank you for being with us.
