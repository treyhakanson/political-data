This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We turned over everything that was work related, every single thing. Personal stuff, we did not. I had no obligation to do so and did not.All I can tell you is that I turned over every work-related e-mail in my possession.What we turned over were more than 30,000 e-mails that I assumed were already in the government system, Bret, because they were sent to state.gov addresses.BAIER: Sure, but there were some that were just recently discovered and turned over.CLINTON: No, that was in the State Department not in me. I turned over everything.My e-mails are so boring.JIMMY KIMMEL, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: Yes. My aren't.CLINTON: I'm embarrassed about that. They're so boring.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: So we've already released, I don't know, 30,000 plus. So what's a few more?(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: What's a few more? Well, there are many more, thousands more. And they are dealing -- excuse me -- they are dealing with things that are clearly not personal, including Benghazi and the Clinton foundation. And we are finding this out day after day. This, as The New York Times, usually a clear supporter of the Democrat candidate, especially in this case, writes this editorial from the editorial board about the ties to the Clinton Foundation: ""When Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state, the Obama administration tried to draw a line between the foundation particularly, its foreign government sponsors and her role. The new e- mails underscore that this effort was, at best, partly successful. The Clinton Foundation has become a symbol of the Clinton's laudable ambitions but also of their tangled alliances and operational opacity. If Mrs. Clinton wins it could prove a target for her political adversaries. Achieving true distance from the foundation is not only necessary to ensure its effectiveness, it's an ethical imperative for Mrs. Clinton.""So with that, we'll bring in the panel: Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of National Review; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Sharyl Attkisson, anchor of Sinclair's 'Full Measure.'Jonah, OK, so you listen to that tape and one after another, ""I turned everything over.""JONAH GOLDBERG, NATIONAL REVIEW: If you go back and go to her initial press conference at the U.N., she had this granite facade of a cover story. And the facts that have come out since then have not only pounded it to rubble but ground it into a fine paste. There is literally not a single factual assertion she has made since back then that hasn't proven to be a demonstrable lie.And the amazing thing, at some point you would think she would want to fire her lawyers because they are the ones who said that they've gone through with a fine-tooth comb. They've read every individual email. It turns out all of that wasn't true either.The one thing they haven't been able to find are any e-mails about yoga. You would think if there were all these tens of thousands of e-mails that were deleted that were about yoga, some of those might have surfaced. But no. It's only the ones about Benghazi, the foundation, and all these things. If she wins, this will haunt her administration far worse than Whitewater ever did her husband's.BAIER: And people overlook the fact that there was testimony here under oath to Congress in which she said some of these very things that have demonstrably proven to be false.A.B. STODDARD, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Right. Jonah is right, so many things she said a year ago. But even that day, that Benghazi testimony in the 11 hours last October, she said I remember that day. She said something, the State Department captured between 90 and 95 percent of her e-mails. And the State Department came out the next week and said they don't know where that number came from, that that wasn't true.She has, obviously, brought this on herself. I think what she probably thought was legalese that would protect her were a bunch of lies that have all been proven wrong. Now it's not just another shoe drop, it's raining shoes. And Democrats are terrified about what is going to be coming out this week and the end of September in the days and weeks before the election.BAIER: It seems like the Benghazi e-mails are especially egregious because they're so -- after all this investigation into Benghazi, to hear that there are at least 30, maybe more Benghazi e-mails.SHARYL ATTKISSON, 'FULL MEASURE': I filed a Freedom of Information Act request for those in 2012, still haven't been filled. It's been, what, four years? Those should be coming to me, but they're not. So that's yet another example of violation of Freedom of Information law at the very least.I also think that when she's talking about separating herself from the Clinton Foundation just to bridge over to there for just a moment, if The New York Times is right and there really are these troubled entanglements, how does separation now really solve that problem if she were to become president? The question is that's water under the bridge. She's already taken money through the foundation from domestic and foreign interests that she will be making decisions about if she's president of the United States. And I'm not sure how logical it is to say separation now would even solve that.BAIER: Is it significant, Jonah, that The New York Times editorial board is out of this you have to break free of this thing because you're going to screw this whole thing up?GOLDBERG: I think it is significant, and that's one of the things that made me think of Whitewater. People forget, New York Times sort of led on Whitewater in the early part of the first Clinton administration. This is the kind of issue that the New York Times is sort of genetically incapable of ignoring, this pay for play, behind-the-scenes access selling.And I think what they're warning her is, look, you know, we think you're going to win but if you don't drop this, we're going to hound you to death on this. It's a sign of how everybody, every Democrat I talk to says they're just terrified of what more is going to come out because Hillary clearly seemed to think that these e-mails wouldn't be coming out.BAIER: And Chelsea still staying at the head almost rubs it in some people's faces.STODDARD: It was unbelievable. Democrats are on the record along with all these editorial boards across the country saying you absolutely have to shutter it or merge it into another foundation so the donations can be collected somewhere else, the work can be done somewhere else detached from the Clinton family at least for four, eight years. And then they announced right after that even though they're going to stop taking foreign and corporate donations when she's president, but Chelsea is going to stay and the Clinton Health Access Initiative, their biggest project, will still be taking foreign money.ATTKISSON: There's a question of what a separation really would mean. You could say you're separated, but what does that mean? But I think they're counting on the public to have this tired, weary feeling, drip, drip about the e-mails and Clinton Foundation. Who is paying that close attention besides us and people watching this show? But I would say the vast majority of people aren't in that deep and they just hear it and they sort of tune it out. And I think they're counting on that.BAIER: I want to turn quickly to the Trump campaign and the speech coming up tomorrow on immigration. Here is Jason Miller, spokesperson for Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JASON MILLER, TRUMP CAMPAIGN: What you've seen with Mr. Trump is he has been remarkably consistent in his pledge to end illegal immigration. We're going to build a wall, we're going to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws. We're going to end sanctuary cities. We're going to pass e-verify. We're going to uphold the constitution. That's going to make a big difference in this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: I guess there's just a lot of people, Jonah, who have seen an evolution, and the Trump campaign itself says wait until the speech.GOLDBERG: Yes. We should. Let's wait till the speech. Earlier this week, we've heard some trial balloons that it may not actually be a real wall. It may be a digital or virtual wall, which seems even more Jeb Bush like. Maybe the Mexicans will pay for this hologram. Who knows?I think that the problem -- the gamble they're making is that the base isn't going to leave them for anything and he needs a lot more than his base. And this is essentially what my colleague calls a ricochet pander where he's trying to say nicer on things like immigration and minorities in order to attract essentially more college-educated whites, particularly college-educated women.BAIER: Sharyl, Monmouth Pennsylvania poll out today, Clinton with 48 percent to 40 percent in the four-way race. Other state polls seem to be tightening a bit, some national polls tightening as well. But the trend is that Clinton has a bit of a lead but it may be softer than it once was after the convention.ATTKISSON: And I agree with Jonah. Obviously, the Trump campaign is looking to see where it can pick up some new voters with appeal to minorities, with discussion maybe softening the immigration stance. And I agree with you when you said even if he softens on immigration, the people that want him to be tighter aren't going to go vote for Hillary Clinton. So the question is whether they lose their enthusiasm and don't come out and vote at all because that's where he stands to really surprise the projections and confound all the polls even if there's a huge turnout of nonvoters, and by that I mean people that haven't voted in a long time, normally don't vote but are so enthused that they might come out to vote, and that this wouldn't show up in the polls ahead of time.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Tonight, ON THE RECORD. Well, you better brace yourself. Rubio suggesting Donald Trump wet his pants last night during the debate.And, today, Trump announcing a bombshell. Donald Trump getting the huge endorsement of former rival New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. And governor Christie is going to be right here to go ON THE RECORD.Also, right now, Donald Trump is about to take the stage at a rally in Oklahoma City. ON THE RECORD will monitor the rally and take you there live.But, first, here is a look at the big announcement from Donald Trump and his rival turned supporter Governor Chris Christie.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am proud to be here to endorse Donald Trump for president of the United States. He will make sure that people around the world know that America keeps its word again. Donald Trump is someone who when he makes a promise, he keeps it.I can guarantee you that the one person that Hillary and bill Clinton do not want to see on that stage come next September is Donald Trump. They know how to run the standard political playbook against junior senators and run them around the block. They do not know the playbook with Donald Trump because he is rewriting the playbook.The idea that Marco Rubio can get inside Donald Trump's head is an interesting proposition, but one that's really for the D.C. parlor game. What Donald Trump is about is about the people of this country.We can't any longer as a country stand up and defend ourselves around the world because we have a leader who wrings his hands and hear any of that this morning from Senator Rubio. So desperate people in campaigns do desperate things, flailing punches in the last days of a losing campaign.The fact of the matter is no one is going to get inside this guy's head. He has lived a lot of life. He's had lots of fights and battles. I have watched him do it. And there is no better fighter than Donald Trump. And he's going to fight for the American people. And you didn't hear Senator Rubio talk about any of that this morning.DONALD TRUMP, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Generally speaking, I'm not big on endorsements. I could have had many endorsements. I have quite a few good ones, but I could have had many, many, but you know, I didn't want to take the time and the two hours and the dinners and everything else. It just wasn't worth it. This was an endorsement that really meant a lot. Chris is an outstanding man with an outstanding family. He has done a great job.CHRISTIE: I concluded along with Mary Pat and the children supported that we wanted to be with the person who we thought could provide the strongest leadership for America and the person who could best make sure that Hillary Clinton never gets within 10 miles of the White House.Once we made that decision, it was clear the only choice was Donald Trump. The best choice was Donald Trump. And the last thing is our family is one that prides loyalty. And the fact is that we have been good friends with Donald and his family for many years. And there was no choice in my mind.And when did I make the final decision? Yesterday morning. I met with Donald. We sat and talked. And he said how about coming out on the road to Texas with me. And I said happy to do it. Whenever you are ready, sir. So we did it and that's how the process went.(END VIDEO) VAN SUSTEREN: And just a short time ago, Governor Christie went ON THE RECORD.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)VAN SUSTEREN: Governor Christie, nice to see you, sir.CHRISTIE: Greta, nice to see you.VAN SUSTEREN: Governor, when did you decide that you wanted to endorse Donald Trump?CHRISTIE: When did I decide to endorse Donald Trump, Thursday morning.VAN SUSTEREN: And what provoked that. What led up to that. Were you just like it's time to do something or what was it?CHRISTIE: Well, first off, Greta, I have had a 14-year friendship with Donald Trump as has my wife, Mary Pat along with Melania. And so we have known them for a very long time. We've been friends with them for a very long time. And I have said that all during the campaign that I have always had a great personal relationship with Donald Trump.It became clear to me in this past week that we need to unite as a party behind the person who gives us the best chance to beat Hillary Clinton. That's what I have been saying all along. I think that's the number one priority to make sure Hillary Clinton never gets back in the White House. And I believe that Donald Trump is the right person to provide the type of strong leadership that both our party and our nation needs to be able to beat Hillary Clinton and move forward to, you know, advance the cause of the people of our country.VAN SUSTEREN: Here's what surprised me. The two of us -- we talked in August along the Jersey Shore, your beautiful state, that beautiful beach that you all have. And when we talked about Donald Trump, here is what you said about him then. That was last August.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIE: Donald is a great guy and a good person, but I just don't think he is suited to be president of the United States.VAN SUSTEREN: Why?CHRISTIE: I don't think his temperament is suited for that and I don't think his experience is.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: So what has happened? I mean, maybe I don't understand politics. But he didn't have the temperament or the experience last August and now you think he is the guy.CHRISTIE: Yes, well, because, Greta, I'm no longer in the race. I was the person best suited to be the president of the United States. The voters decided, otherwise. And with the folks remaining on that stage, Donald Trump is by far and away with his executive experience, with his toughness, with his vision for the country's future, by far and away the best person to be the Republican nominee for president.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, if you and I were both in the courtroom, you know, I would point out to you, and I'm pointing out now, as you said, you don't think -- it doesn't say, I don't think I'm better in temperament and better in experience, you said, I don't think his temperament is suited and I don't think, you know, his experience is. That's different.CHRISTIE: I understand, Greta. I understand what you are saying and I'm telling you that I believe that Donald Trump is the person on that stage now who is best suited, best prepared to make America the kind of leader around the world that it needs to be again, to make sure that we have peace in the world.And he is the kind of person who will be best for America's economy. And let's face it, we've got two first-term United States senators on that stage, who are just, you know, ill prepared to be president of the United States. And my choice is I believe Donald Trump is the best person.VAN SUSTEREN: Do you think that this race has gotten a little bit off the rails? I mean, we've got a situation where today Senator Marco Rubio made some reference that he thought that Donald Trump wet his pants last night during the debate. And Donald Trump certainly has said things about Senator Marco Rubio likewise back.Has this GOP race gotten a little off the rails in terms of issues?CHRISTIE: Greta, listen. It's very competitive. There are also lots of important issues discussed last night in the race.And I understand. Senator Rubio is at that point in the campaign where you are throwing hay makers every minute, trying to hope that you land one. I understand what he is trying to do. And so the fact is, though, that Donald Trump last night spoke on that stage very forcefully about what he wants to do for this country.And, you know, campaigns, when they get near, you're four days away from 11 contests, Greta, everybody is trying real hard. And so, you know, I don't think folks should believe this has gone off the rails. No. People are competing with each other. They are trying hard. And so not every word that comes out of everyone's mouth is going to be perfect. That's OK.VAN SUSTEREN: One of the issues that Donald Trump is getting hit for is his tax returns. He says he is in an audit, which I totally understand. Frankly, if I were his lawyers, if indeed he's in an audit, I would say wait until the audit is over since you don't want your tax returns going out in piecemeal.What about the suggestion, though, that he release tax returns that predate the years he is getting audited? I assume that he is only getting audited at most going back three years.CHRISTIE: Yes. Greta, listen, the bottom line is this, Mr. Trump is going to release his tax returns. But he is not going to release them until his counsel tells him that it is appropriate for him to do so given that he is being audited. And the fact is that you don't want to release the piecemeal and just give a piece of information from folks from previous years without seeing the entire picture.VAN SUSTEREN: How about the old one, though?CHRISTIE: I talked to him about this personally.(CROSSTALK)VAN SUSTEREN: The old ones.(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: Greta, that's only part of this -- Greta, that's only part of the story. If you want to really know what Donald Trump earns every year, who he donates to every year, a complete picture of his -- of those habits, you need to release all the tax returns. And that's what he will do, but only after the time that the audit is complete. And so he has made that very clear.He wants to be completely transparent about this. I've spoken to him about this personally. He has no reluctance to release his tax returns. I mean, he's not going to do so while he's amidst of an audit and do it against the advice of the attorneys who are representing him.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. Well, you and I were just not to believe it right now. I would disagree with you on the ones that aren't subject to the audit because I know the IRS audit can take forever. And he could be out of office, doing two terms in the presidency before an audit is ever finished. So we never see them with the way the IRS works.CHRISTIE: Well, Greta, that's a problem with the IRS, not a problem with Donald Trump.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. Now, when you told them that you are going to endorse him, what did he say to you?CHRISTIE: He said I'm thrilled and thank you.VAN SUSTEREN: And did you have to make the --(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: And said, how quickly can we do it? And I said, well, when did you want to do it? And he said, will you come to Texas tomorrow? And I said, I'd be happy to.And I got on the plane last night, while the debate was going on and flew down to Texas. And we did our endorsement event this morning.VAN SUSTEREN: Did you have to make an awkward phone call to Governor Kasich, for instance, or Dr. Ben Carson. I suspect you and Senator Rubio aren't that chummy. I have seen what happened in that debate in New Hampshire. But did you make phone calls to the others?CHRISTIE: No awkward phone calls needed to be made, Greta, no. And the fact is that everybody knows that politics is about choosing. And I made a choice. It's my choice. I'm proud of that choice. It's Mary Pat's choice as well. And we are looking forward to working hard for our friend Donald Trump as he gets the Republican nomination, and making sure we do everything we can to make sure we beat Hillary Clinton.VAN SUSTEREN: I take it that if Senator Rubio is the nominee, will you get behind him, if he beats -- certainly seen -- I have seen your comments on him.CHRISTIE: As I have said, Greta, ever since I signed the pledge that the Republican National Committee chairman put in front of me back last August, I will support the Republican nominee for president of the United States because any of those folks will be a better president than Hillary Clinton.VAN SUSTEREN: Would you agree with me on this that politics is a sure -- is sure a whole lot different than the courtroom?CHRISTIE: Yes, it is, Greta. It is a whole lot different than the courtroom. No doubt about it.VAN SUSTEREN: We have rules in the courtroom, don't we?CHRISTIE: Yes, well, I mean, depending on who the judge is. Sometimes those rules are followed differently, right, Greta? It's always important who the person is sitting behind the bench and making the calls. Sometimes, we see the rules one way or the other. That's where, you know, the court is somewhat like politics. But there is no doubt there are differences.VAN SUSTEREN: Indeed. Governor, thank you for joining us and good luck, sir.CHRISTIE: Greta, thanks for having me very much. And I appreciate the time.(END VIDEO)"	['Carson', 'Rubio', 'Clinton', 'Christie', 'Trump']	[]

9	9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/06/01/what-is-bernie-sanders-endgame/	What is Bernie Sanders' endgame?	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" June 1, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we win California and if we win South Dakota and North Dakota and Montana and New Mexico and New Jersey, well, I think we will be -- and the following week do well in Washington, D.C., I think we will be marching into the Democratic convention with an enormous amount of momentum.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Bernie Sanders wasn't yelling like Howard Dean was in Iowa, but he was listing the states he wants to and believes he can win. This as a new poll comes out tonight in California that essentially puts him tied with Hillary Clinton in California. This is the case he's making is that he's better positioned against Donald Trump. A Quinnipiac poll backs that up in the head-to-head, Clinton versus Trump and Sanders versus Trump. But in the same poll Clinton is up by 13 points over Sanders nationally, and she is 71 delegates short of getting the Democratic nomination because of super delegates.We'll start there on politics. Let's bring in our panel: Tucker Carlson, host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend,"" Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Tucker, you heard Bernie Sanders there, and he's making the pitch to California.TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS: I think he's going to march to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia no matter what happens in the subsequent six or seven states. The truth is he is as unlikely a candidate really as Donald Trump. He is without charm. He's elderly. He's running an economic program that's 80 years old and has been proven not to work. And yet he's drawing crowds of people who know for a certainty that he's not going to win, and they are coming out anyway. What does that tell you? It tells you the power of running on something in contrast to the sort of tepid identity politics campaign his opponent is running. He is running on something that's actually resonating. And he's going to extract eye teeth at that convention. There's no question about that.BAIER: All right, Chuck. It's the realism of trying to convince people that in fact he can still win the nomination.CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, I think he is making an additional pitch, which is, as you referred to those polls that show him beating Trump, and that's been a consistent finding in those polls going back several months now. And he's saying in a weird way I'm the more realistic candidate in a way because I'm the one who would have an easier time beating Trump.Now, obviously it isn't that realistic because there are the super delegates and so on standing in his way. I guess his end game goes something like this. I come in as close as I possibly can to the number into the convention, and between now and then something develops, maybe regarding the e-mails, that causes the party to need to look for somebody else, and I'll be standing there and it will fall into my lap.BAIER: Meantime, there's another person that's really anxious to be out campaigning, and that is the president who talked about Donald Trump not by name but by policy issues and also a certain network.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So their basic story is America's working class, America's middle class, families like yours, have been victimized by a big, bloated federal government run by a bunch of left wing elitists like me.I'm being serious here. I mean, that's the story that's been told. And I haven't, you know, turned on FOX News or listened to conservative talk radio yet today, but I turned them on enough over these past seven and a half years to know I'm not exaggerating in terms of their story.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: President Obama in Indiana today.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, he's making it sound as if this idea of the big, bloated federal government run by left wing elitists is some kind of FOX News fantasy. How about exhibit a, Obamacare. Jonathan Gruber and all the others who foist it upon the United States, elitists, pointed-headed intellectuals who designed a program that is collapsing of its own weight. It's costing enormous amounts of money, having a terrible effect on the medicine -- on medical -- on the medical profession and I think will be gone one way or the other in several years is a perfect example of left wing hyper-liberalism.Obama brought into office this idea that government can and should try and do everything, thwarted by Democrats who stopped the cap and trade, who stopped a lot of other measures that Obama would like to do. This is exactly what his government has done, and it has given us a very weak economy. And all the anxiety that everyone is acknowledging is what the candidates are running on, Sanders, Trump, all the others as a result of a weak economy, a terrible recovery, and people who have a sense that they are being squeezed.The irony is it's the Democratic candidates themselves who make the case against the big government because of the results of what Obama has wrought and how it's affected the electorate.BAIER: Chuck, you can see that almost every speech now the president is anxious to get into this game, the 2016 game. He has been prevented from doing that essentially from this race continuing on the Democratic side, but it looks like he's just going anyway.LANE: There's a big kind of irony involved here, which is that the implication of the whole Bernie Sanders campaign by implication says the last eight years accomplished nothing. We're not sufficient. We're not progressive enough. And by associating Hillary with that, he's accusing her of being a fake progressive. So part of what Obama is doing, also by implication, is shoring up Hillary, I think.And interestingly I think he's -- his numbers are good right now. His favorability rating is up over 51 percent.BAIER: President Barack Obama's at 51, yes.LANE: Yes. And I think he is crying vindication right now. That's what that speech you just did was all about was sort of like, hey, I'm supposed to be so terrible. If so, why am I so popular?BAIER: Meantime the Democratic presumptive nominee, we should point out she's on her way probably to these, delegates was out talking about Trump University today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every day we learn more about Donald Trump. Just yesterday we learned the truth about Donald Trump's big talk about helping veterans. It turns out it wasn't until the press shamed him that he actually made the donations he had promised.Well, today, we're learned about another scam, the so-called Trump University. He is trying to scam America the way the scammed all those people at Trump U.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Trump U. OK, Hope Hicks with the Trump campaign put out a statement. ""The court's order unsealing documents has no bearings on the merits of the Trump University case. Much of the unsealed evidence including declarations and surveys from former Trump University students demonstrates the high level of satisfaction from students and that Trump University taught valuable real estate information. Trump University looks forward to using this evidence along with much more to win when the case is brought before a jury."" Is this -- does this have legs, Tucker, and what about this whole dustup?CARLSON: Of course Trump University isn't wholly legitimate. Would you send your kids there? I don't think there's a single person who thinks Trump U, I hope my children good ate from Trump U. People knew that going in at the beginning and they know it now. By the way, is it much more of a scam than, say, Princeton? I don't know. That's open to debate.But yes, sure will it change the mind of a single voter? Is there any person who said oh, Trump U wasn't on the level? That's it, I'm voting Hillary. Probably not. We've seen for the past year Trump getting a pass on these issues. People know who he is and they're supporting him anyway for reasons that have nothing to do with the details of his biography.BAIER: Meantime, on the Republican side you get a lot of pushback saying where are the investigations into the Clinton Foundation? Where is the other shoe to drop with all the things that they are involved in? Now we're hearing tonight that Bryan Pagliano, the I.T. specialist, is going to plead the fifth in the e-mail investigation. Is there a tit for tat here that is equal when it comes to problems for both candidates?KRAUTHAMMER: Look, there's always been a double standard with Trump, for Trump.

This is going to come out one way or the other.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
