This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: This is a Fox News alert. Hello, everyone, I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle and there is breaking news overseas, another terror attack, this time in Israel. Gunmen opening fire at a popular market in Tel Aviv; at least three people are dead, several others injured, two suspects are in custody. They are Palestinian cousins who were dressed as orthodox Jews. Check out this dramatic moment when police arrived on the scene.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On camera, but --GUILFOYLE: One of the hospital, but this police custody. Yeah. John Huddy is there and joins us live now with the latest. Jon?JOHN HUDDY, FOX NEWS REPORTER: Yeah. Well, Kimberly, this is a beautiful summer evening here in Tel Aviv. Obviously, this restaurants and bars behind me were packed with people and that's when it was shattered by the sound of gunfire. Submachine gun as you mentioned, two attackers according to our sources, cousins from the Hebron area. Hebron is an area in the west bank just outside Jerusalem. It's a hot spot for attacks. We've seen attempted stabbings, stabbings there over the last year, year and a half. But tonight, this attack happened right around 9:30 earlier in the evening when the two attackers opened fire. We understand they may have had submachine guns and they may have been dressed as orthodox Jews to try to blend in and disguise. I talked to several witnesses, two guys who are at the bar, a place called Max Brenner. Again, this is a very vibrant busy area in central Tel Aviv. Again, beautiful evening so there are a lot of people out, and these two witnesses say they heard a rain of gunshots as one described it. He said he saw one of the presumably gunmen opening fire. And that's when a stampede of people tried to rush out of the area. Another woman I talked to said people were falling over themselves, obviously in panic, trying to get out of the area. Right now, let me just show you quickly, behind me, and if my, you need my photographer can push in. You could see the restaurant in the distance. And by the way, police, we were a lot closer in over the last 20 minutes, they've really pushed all of us all being the media, pretty far away from the restaurant. But inside crime scene, investigators are of course looking over the area, trying to gather more evidence. There's a huge contingent as you can imagine of police, of security forces. Unfortunately, this is not the first incident to happen this year, here in Tel Aviv. On New Year's Day, a lone gunman, a lone wolf gunman opened fire in downtown Tel Aviv, killing several people -- again, a busy area, a lot of bars, a lot of restaurants there and once again, the same thing here in central Tel Aviv.GUILFOYLE: OK, John .(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: . we're going to take it around the table. We have some questions for you. Eric?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: John, tell us about these gunmen?HUDDY: Sure.BOLLING: Are they -- number one, are they apprehended, killed? What's the story? And you said you knew, possibly, where they came from.HUDDY: Yeah.BOLLING: Are they affiliated or associated with any of the terrorist groups, Hezbollah or Hamas in the region?HUDDY: Well, we don't. Well, we don't know that. I don't know the answer to that. They could have been acting, again, the kind of lone wolf type situation or maybe they were connected in some way to some kind of terror cell, but I can't tell you definitively whether that's the case or not. As far as the two attackers, one -- both are in custody. One is in surgery right now. We understand. The other is in custody. Well, I'm not sure of the extent of his injuries, but three people were killed at the restaurant. And about from what we're hearing at this point, 13 others injured, but of course, that number could be much higher. It's a fluid situation. Again, it just happen a couple of hours ago, yet another violent attack here in Tel Aviv, as I said.GUILFOYLE: All right, Meghan, you have a question for John?MEGHAN MCCAIN, GUEST CO-HOST: Has there been a rise in these kind of shootings and attacks in the past six months or so?HUDDY: There's been -- well, there are, basically, there have been ebbs and flows. Last year, late September and mid October, we really saw an increase in the number of attacks. Mostly stabbings, car ramming where the assailants would ram their vehicle up on a, you know, a sidewalk or a bus stop, and then get out and start attacking with a knife. And since then, there have been near daily attempted stabbings, stabbings on mostly border police and security forces along the west bank borders, including Hebron, again, where these two assailants are according to our sources, cousins; that they lived in that area. That's a very, that's a hot spot and has been. Has there been a rise? Again, it comes in waves. We'll see things be very quiet for a couple weeks and then a number of attacks. But this, since the New Year's Day attack has been the worst, thus far. Again, a very busy popular area in central Tel Aviv, a lot of bars, a lot of restaurants, a lot of tourists for that matter.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: John -- it's Juan Williams. I was just wondering, you said they opened fire in a restaurant in the mall. I wonder why they didn't open fire in the mall and what do we know about the victims?HUDDY: Well, I don't know much about the victims right now. We're waiting for more information. This -- just a kind to set the scene for you a little bit. It's an outdoor area, OK? You can -- let me step out of the way and I'm sure how much you can see. Now you can see some obviously, some police standing there. But there's a large kind of plaza area here. And on the other side, there's a series of towers, condominium towers, apartments. And then throughout the vicinity here there are a lot of outdoor bars and restaurants, a lot of stores, as well. So it's not like, it's an enclosed mall. It's an outside area. And this particular restaurant where it happened, Max Brenner is a very popular restaurant. It's a big restaurant and it's in the central part, really of this, of this shopping area. And you know an area where it's full of bars and restaurants. So, again, a beautiful evening, why did they, you know, they were -- I mean, to answer your question, Juan, bottom line is, this is probably one of the busiest areas of this location. So, you know, obviously they had scoped this out. What we're hearing is they had been in the area, possibly seen walking along the area before going into this restaurant, sitting down and then opening fire.GUILFOYLE: Right. Tom, you have a question?TOM SHILLUE, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah, John -- Tom Shillue. I'm wondering if you're -- you're noticing on the ground. Obviously, Israelis are more used to terrorism than most people are. Is there any contrast to the way that they deal with these incidents in Israel? That you know, choose --for instance, a way we deal with them in this country. As far as people's reaction, how quickly they react? How quickly they bounce back, et cetera.HUDDY: Well, you know, unfortunately it's been a fact of life here. Of course, the first, second intifadas. Then you had operation protective edge, the war in Gaza. And then after that it was quiet for a couple months, and then these attacks started up. Mostly carried about -- carried out by lone wolf attackers. You know, but as far as people's resiliency, you know, it is a fact of life. It's something people do live with, those who, in particular, survive the first and second intifadas. And just about everybody here in Israel has been affected by terror attacks, has known someone who was injured. A family member, a friend, in the first and second intifadas, even I met a guy was at the gym. He was a border policeman at Hebron, border crossing at Hebron, which is a hot spot, pulled up a shirt, showed me where he was stabbed several times, he had the scars on. So this is an unfortunate fact of life. Do people is traumatizing? Does it shock people? Obviously, those who are here and who witness it, but again, it's yet another attack here in Israel -- guys?GUILFOYLE: All right. Thanks, John, and much more to come on ""The Five."" We're going to turn to the presidential race, next, with two presumptive nominees. The general election battle is on, stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Welcome back to ""The Five"" and we now have two presumptive presidential nominees. Hillary Clinton celebrated her historic achievement last night after becoming a first woman to clinch a major American party's nomination. And she didn't waste any time gearing up for the general election, neither did Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: When he says, ""Let's make America great again,"" that is code for - - let's take America backwards. It's clear that Donald Trump doesn't believe we are stronger together.DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund. The Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese, all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return. The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. Bolling, gloves are off.BOLLING: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Mano a mano, combat between Clinton and Trump.BOLLING: Yeah, and Trump --GUILFOYLE: What's going to happen?BOLLING: Trump is very good last night. He went back on the teleprompter, he stayed, he focused on to Hillary Clinton and that's what he needs to do to win. It's not playing around with these other things, the satellite issues, the rabbit holes, everyone for the media likes to drag him down, and focus on her. She has run as the next President Obama, a continuation of President Obama's wonderful policies.GUILFOYLE: Third term, yeah.BOLLING: That she is tapping her base for, to try and get those votes, those left-wing voters that love Obama. She's there. We'll, make her own it. The middle class has shrunk under President Obama. The rich have gotten richer, the poor have gotten poorer. Income inequalities widened. Salaries -- numerically, the economy is flat at best under President Obama. If not, well --GUILFOYLE: African-American community worse off. Yeah.BOLLING: African- American on employment, income inequality. Again, all the things that you would want to run against, you have it for you, Donald Trump. There she is, she wants that, give it to her.GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, Juan, as he was saying a third term, you know, a Barack Obama. You were nodding your head saying yes, because for people that are supporters and liberals, you think that's a fine thing.GUILFOYLE: Well, I do. I mean, right now, President Obama is approval rate something up, well I think it's like 52, 53. So he is plus in terms of, you know, favorable/unfavorable. So, that's good news for the democrats. And people are going to want, in fact, to claim that Bernie Sanders' base -- we'll talk about it later, but I mean, Obama has the ability to go back to those young people, especially educated young women who backed him and say, it's time to move over and get behind Hillary. So I think in so many ways, you know, she's gonna -- I think there's a meeting tomorrow, Kimberly, between Bernie Sanders and President Obama. That's going to be a critical moment. Vice president --GUILFOYLE: At Sanders' request.WILLIAMS: Right.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: And Vice President Biden said today that, you know, you got to be graceful about it. Give Bernie Sanders some time. But let me tell you, the dogs are out right now, in terms of Democratic Party leadership saying to him, hey, listen, you're not only hurting Hillary Clinton. You're hurting the party's ability to reclaim the Senate, or to go after some of these House seats.GUILFOYLE: All right, well, it's definitely release the hound's time, Miss McCain. So what do you make of this? It is an historic achievement .MCCAIN: Yes.GUILFOYLE: . that she's been nominated, and that's fine.BOLLING: Can I just jump in here?GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: And I'm sorry, this Historic achievement that it's the first woman nominated to become president or the first person nominated who was actually under FBI investigation.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Oh.BOLLING: Which --WILLIAMS: Oh. You know what? I think you --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: That's a rabid shot. That wasn't even a cheap, that's a rabid shot.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Did you have to -- not inaccurate --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I could be wrong. There may have been someone earlier that who is under FBI investigation.WILLIAMS: Oh, please.(LAUGHTER)MCCAIN: Well, I was watching this last night, and, you know, it was being hyped up so much as this is historic moment. This is the moment you should be. As a woman, I should be having this emotional reaction. And it was in my apartment with two friends, and we were like, I was like, I don't know if it's just because I'm 31-years-old, I don't, because I've been in politics a long time, because she's an evil woman who is under the FBI investigation who I don't trust to be the nominee, another one president. I didn't feel anything. I don't care if she's a woman. I could not care less. I'm like a classic millennial in that point. I know a lot of people, this is historic to them, but I believe there's going to be a woman president in my lifetime. I hope it's a republican --GUILFOYLE: Like Condoleezza Rice.MCCAIN: Yeah, like Condoleezza Rice.GUILFOYLE: Run, Condi, run.MCCAIN: Exactly. It's amazing how insignificant it was to me.GUILFOYLE: Tom, She doesn't have that tingling feeling up her leg, but do you?SHILLUE: Well, no. I don't, because --(LAUGHTER)SHILLUE: When you -- maybe it's because she's been in the White House since we were kids.MCCAIN: Yes.SHILLUE: I mean it's not -- we know Hillary has been around. It's not like, oh wow, there's something, you know, a woman running. And there -- we all, you know, it's no surprise. I wish we would stop patting ourselves on the back, oh, we're so progressive now. We actually have a woman running for president. But you know, we all know, like we would all love a woman president, we just don't want Hillary. That's, that's the issue.WILLIAMS: Speak for yourself buddy.SHILLUE: And she's talking about the glass ceiling.WILLIAMS: Speak for yourself.(LAUGHTER)SHILLUE: Well, yes.WILLIAMS: Thanks you.SHILLUE: And many, and many of us, Juan.(LAUGHTER)SHILLUE: But she's going to keep talking about the glass ceiling and everything like, but I mean, it's not impressing m. I'll tell you that.GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, somebody who is trying to press up against the ceiling with her is Bernie Sanders, because he's expected to cut his staff in half next week, but he still has no plans to drop out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BERNIE SANDERS, PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We take our fight for social, economy, racial and environmental justice to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I am pretty good in arithmetic and I know that the fight in front of us is a very, very steep fight, but we will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate we can get.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. Bolling, so he wants to take this fight to Philly. This is about the convention. It's about having a platform there and a strong voice .BOLLING: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . in position.BOLLING: He has five of the 15 spots that are going to dictate the democrat platform. So what Bernie Sanders is doing right now is carving out a niche for Bernie Sanders, right? The democrats have to be going when is, will he just throw the towel in and get behind her. Remember when Hillary Clinton, three days after she lost the California or whatever the last primary was where Barack Obama got the majority, went from plurality to majority in 2008. Three days later, she not only got out of the race, she endorsed, aggressively endorsed Barack Obama, so you need to follow him. I don't think Bernie is going to do it. He should, the democrats would love him to do it.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: He won't, because this is about Bernie Sanders. And you're going to hear more of his socialist platform. His socialist ideals come out when the democrats put together what they're all about in -- in a month from now. End of July in Philly, they're going to tell, this is what the democrat platform is. It's going to be riddled with -- my guess is $15 an hour minimum wage, income inequality initiatives, redistribution of wealth, taxes going up.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: And boy, I got to tell you, that ain't going to be good for Hillary Clinton, she can't be loving any of this.GUILFOYLE: She's going to -- she's getting kind of pressed on both sides and saying, oh, maybe U.S. is also ready for a double woman ticket.WILLIAMS: You know I was sort of surprised that Bernie Sanders last night, because he took forever, for example to even give a speech, right?MCCAIN: Yes.WILLIAMS: He just took forever. I think what's he doing? Then it turns out, not only does he really -- he's reluctant to mention her name. Much less say, I called her to congratulate her. And when he does, and the folks start to boo, he just lets it go on. I'm like what is going on here? That did not look like a classy guy to me or a guy who wants to get out, to get to your point. To the contrary, it looks like Bernie is about Bernie now --GUILFOYLE: Digging in.WILLIAMS: Yeah. There was a little -- I read something where once Al Gore had to call Howard Dean and Howard Dean was ranting about, ""I don't want to get out. I don't want it."" And you know what Al Gore said to him, ""Hey, it's not about you, Howard Dean, it's about the country.""BOLLING: Country.WILLIAMS: But in Bernie's case, he is looking to maximize leverage headed toward Philadelphia.BOLLING: Interestingly, Howard Dean is also is on yesterday -- this morning or yesterday morning saying, Bernie should get out.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: And he should and he should start a Super PAC --WILLIAMS: Let him do it.BOLLING: To elect liberals to Super PAC.WILLIAMS: But he's hurting himself now.GUILFOYLE: Well, he's also is Hillary, you know, surrogate, so he wants, he's like bye-bye, Bernie.SHILLUE: But out of a way, we love people who are running against the odds. I mean, that's what where -- that's went rocky. You know, it's like -- we don't want people to drop out. I think everyone is dropping out too soon. I think --WILLIAMS: It's over.MCCAIN: But she has something --WILLIAMS: It's over.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: She has the nominee.MCCAIN: She has the majority of pledged delegates .WILLIAMS: Yes.MCCAIN: . not superdelegates. What you were saying about late it was, I was up until 2:30 in the morning watching this, because he was waiting forever to make it happen. That, by the way, I find just unprofessional and of itself. He's going to stand this long enough to become the villain. In that crowd right there, we've all seen hundreds and hundreds of stump speeches by candidates. That crowd was angry .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Yeah.MCCAIN: They were intense. I could feel it through the screen.GUILFOYLE: They were yelling when --(CROSSTALK)SHILLUE: Angry voters?MCCAIN: But this is --(LAUGHTER)SHILLUE: I can't believe it.MCCAIN: No, but this is something that's very different. It was palpable. And to the point and like, he isn't doing anything to quell it. And whatever you want to say about Donald Trump amping things up, what about this? He's making this even worse, and he's not going to get out like you said. And I just don't know how Hillary, possibly gets these supporters --BOLLING: And so, this is, this is what's going on, on the right. It was the outsiders versus the insiders. The establishment, the Donald Trump against the establishment and they are continuing that fight, apparently ongoing. I think he's probably going to back out at some point, but they're continuing, ongoing. And again, this is such an opportunity for Trump, because --MCCAIN: Yes.BOLLING: If you boo when you mention Hillary Clinton's name .MCCAIN: Right.BOLLING: . at a Bernie rally; that means they really don't want Hillary Clinton and the only one left .GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: ... it's not going to be Bernie, its Trump.WILLIAMS: Oh.GUILFOYLE: But one of the most anticipated moments in the general election, Clinton and Trump's first face-off on the debate stage. Even the secretary herself said she's eagerly awaiting it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID MUIR, ABC ""WORLD NEWS TONIGHT WITH DAVID MUIR"": Are you ready for the debate stage against Donald Trump?CLINTON: I am so looking forward to it.MUIR: You are?CLINTON: Absolutely, I really am. I think it would be a singular moment in American history, because I think I'll have a chance to make clear why I believe that he is not qualified and temperamentally unfit to be president.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. So she's got the best word to fill in, Meghan.MCCAIN: Yeah, I'm like --GUILFOYLE: To say, temperament.MCCAIN: Not so fast, Rodham. Seriously --GUILFOYLE: Rodham.MCCAIN: She goes to one coughing fit in a debate with him. He's going to go after her like a shark. I actually think that he --GUILFOYLE: Or extended bathroom break?MCCAIN: Or extended bathroom break. She's really bad off the cuff. She's so scripted. She can't get off her talking points. These are all the strengths Donald Trump has. I think for her to be this cocky is very dangerous.GUILFOYLE: All right. What do you think, Bolling? I mean, he's obviously not going to shy away from it, because he faced .BOLLING: Yes --GUILFOYLE: . far more competition in the, you know, republican primaries and debates.BOLLING: So, you know how these debates have themes? There was, there was a couple of business debates, Fox Business had a business debate. And then there was the national security debate. It depends. I think she will give him a hard time in the national security stuff, the foreign policy, national security stuff. She, she's clearly got the experience. She's knows the names.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: She knows the places and the people. But if the first debate is one on the economy or a business debate, I think he will eat her lunch and hopefully, you know, for a republican --GUILFOYLE: Dinner.BOLLING: And there's -- yeah, I hope that one happens first.WILLIAMS: But you know one of the things she said in the interview was this is the guy that not just wants to build the wall. He wants to wall off Americans from Americans. He wants to divide us. And I think, actually, to me, the big news of the day is people like Lindsey Graham saying, you know, when we will a allow love of country to Trump, love of -- or hatred of Hillary? And you start, you stop seeing news -- the front page of the New York ""Daily News"" has Paul Ryan pointing at Donald Trump from saying, ""I'm with racist."" I mean, McConnell, you know, he is saying, you know, the far right has spoken. They want Donald Trump. But he says, you know, I don't feel good about Bill Kristol tweeting, ""Trump is an inexcusable bigot,"" but the GOP's officials decisions is --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: He's got -- yes.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, (inaudible). Here's on a filibuster.WILLIAMS: No, because --GUILFOYLE: She's gonna read --WILLIAMS: No, no.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I just -- No, I'm just telling you, there's a big issue here with republican acceptance of Trump and he goes into a debate, and you're saying Hillary is going to be nervous? I think he's got the reason to be nervous. She's going to portray him in the words of republicans.GUILFOYLE: I don't think he's nervous.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: All right. Go ahead, Tom.SHILLUE: He can fight her with boredom. I like Boring Trump. People last night said he wasn't exciting because he reads the teleprompter.(CROSSTALK)SHILLUE: Boring Trump could win this. I mean the contrast between her, saying, he's temperamentally unfit .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.SHILLUE: . and him, just being calm and reasonable; that works.GUILFOYLE: Well, the head of the RNC loved it, right, Bolling? Reince tweeted out saying that it was outstanding. It's just the right message to bring the party together that he can make the GOP proud. He's not going to disappoint them or let them down, much remains to be seen, that's why it's keep it Fox News.Ahead, if Sanders drops out, who will win over his supporters in the general election? Trump and Clinton have begun making their appeals. And a quick programming note, tune into ""Special Report"" tonight at 6:00 p.m., Bret Baier is going to interview the presumptive democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, right here on the Fox News Channel, so don't even think about missing it.(LAUGHTER)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Bernie Sanders lost the democratic primary race, he's going to meet with President Obama tomorrow at Bernie's request more than 10 million Americans felt the Bern at the polls, and both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are now actively fighting for the Bernie vote.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: To all of those Bernie Sanders voters, who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of superdelegates, we welcome you with open arms.CLINTON: Whether you supported me, or Senator Sanders, or one of the republicans, we all need to keep working for a better, fairer, stronger America. Now I know it never feels good to put your heart into a cause or a candidate you believe in, and to come up short. I know that feeling well. As we look ahead to the battle awaits, let's remember all that unites us.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: OK. Do you hear it? ""Fairer."" Looking for a fairer America. That's a Bernie buzz word.GUILFOYLE: I'm going to get my little decoder out of my cereal box so I can figure out all the weird things she's saying. I mean, this is all going to be coded messages, that, you know, Donald Trump speaks in coded messages. Bernie Sanders.Listen, there's nobody on the Dem side that thought that this would happen, that Sanders was still going to be like fingernails, like, hanging onto the side of the wall, like -- and, you know, Hillary stepping on his fingers one at a time, crushing them into the bricks. You know? But that is what's happening.So when you look at it and people talk about the Republican Party, OK, so we got a little flavor. We're a little exciting this time. The other side has got issues in terms of who's going to be the one to carry the party mantle forward, and your girl is getting pushed to the left more.BOLLING: Juan, there's a ""never Trump"" group that not only will not vote for Trump, who say they will vote for Hillary over Trump, because they can't bring themselves to do it. Why do you think there's not a ""never Hillary"" group that would vote for Trump?WILLIAMS: Because you look at the polls, there was a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll over the first four months, so it wasn't even just one poll. It was over the first four months, first quarter of this year. And what it found was, among Sanders supporters, only 6 percent had a positive impression of Trump. Ninety percent had a negative impression.And I think if you boil it down to the big issues like what about free college tuition? What about free medical care for everybody? What about a hike in the minimum wage? I just don't see Trump supporters saying, ""Oh, yes, we like government. We like government coming in and telling people what to do and more government."" I don't see it, but it's possible.I think what you're on to is, there's people -- maybe Kimberly was saying - - there are people who are, you know, Sanders supporters who are just angry and turned off.GUILFOYLE: Yes. Mad.WILLIAMS: They're very angry, very passionate. I mean, you call it passionate, but sometimes it comes across as just angry.BOLLING: So Meghan, is that the case, that they won't vote for Trump, but then they won't vote for Hillary, either?MCCAIN: I actually disagree. I think a lot of millennials are going -- I follow many of them on Twitter. Two people in particular that are so angry at Hillary Clinton in a way that, like, shocks me. That I think they will actually vote for Trump as, like, a hate vote against Hillary. Whether or not they love Trump or not, it's an anti-establishment person, as well. And I think to a lot of people, that's the only thing that matters. They just want change in Washington and a nonpolitician. Hillary has a lot of work to do.And again, the anger last night. I've seen so many rallies. You could feel the intensity through the television set. And he is stoking their anger. He's making it worse; he's not trying to quell anything. He was like -- he was almost like messianic, in a sense. And I think he is under the delusion that he is the first folk hero candidate that's ever existed. Howard Dean's another great example. My father in 1999 was one of those candidates, as well.And I am fascinated what President Obama is going to say to Bernie Sanders in their meeting at the White House on Thursday. Because if you are smart, President Obama, you're going to say, ""Listen, homeboy, pull this thing out, you're done. There's no foreseeable way for you to make it to the White House, and you're damaging her and ultimately helping Trump.""BOLLING: And if he were homeboy, he might say...MCCAIN: I'm sorry.BOLLING: ""Listen to me, Mr. Obama. I'm the outsider here. You're insider."" Where's Donald Trump's opportunity? Or Hillary's, for that matter?SHILLUE: Well, his opportunity is not the things that -- you're right, Juan, the things that you mentioned, free college tuition, et cetera. It's not those issues, but it is the blue-collar voters. It's the coal miners. It's the people who are disaffected by this economy. And don't tell me there's not a lot of leftists, Juan, who don't like the idea of open borders. And they don't like the idea of NAFTA and these trade deals. So those are the voters that Trump can pick up, not the free college tuition ones.BOLLING: Yes, so take that, Juan. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.GUILFOYLE: But all of them help, right? Why not try and pick-pocket a couple of them over and, like, open the tent? That should be good, and the Republicans should be happy about that.BOLLING: I think -- Juan, I think this is a year that these polls don't mean squat. We -- no one has predicted Donald Trump would be the nominee early on.WILLIAMS: Not me.BOLLING: No one predicted...WILLIAMS: I think you did.GUILFOYLE: Wait for the -- wait for the enthusiasm of voter turnout on election day.BOLLING: But how many times were there -- how many times were there polls that said Donald Trump can't be the nominee. There's no chance he can be - - he can't be...WILLIAMS: Oh, no, no, no. That's not true. The polls were always -- the polls always said Trump was in the lead.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.BOLLING: You're out of your mind.WILLIAMS: The polls didn't say...BOLLING: The polls had 1 percent for the first month.WILLIAMS: No, I'm talking about really since we got going, Trump has been in the lead in all the polls.BOLLING: My point is that -- that you're telling me only 6 percent of people would associate with a Donald Trump...WILLIAMS: Who are Sanders, currently Sanders supporters.BOLLING: I think that number is vastly underreported.GUILFOYLE: Wait and see. Wait for it.BOLLING: All right. Coming up next, Hillary Clinton shifted to the far left this presidential cycle. Is she too radical now to win the general election? Stick around.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Trying to compete against socialist Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton has shifted her policy positions farther and farther to the left.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Stop the raids; stop the round-ups. Stop the deporting of people who are living here, doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority.We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.Grandparents who worry about retirement deserve a president who will protect and then expand Social Security for those who need it most.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: Do you believe in individuals' right to bear arms is a constitutional right?CLINTON: If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulations.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: The question now is will her ultraliberal agenda pose a possible for her in the general election?Meghan, let me talk quick politics with you. I would say on the trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, she clearly was pro-TPP while secretary of state. Now, in the campaign said no.One that's dear to my heart, charter schools. She was a supporter of school reform. Now, because of the unions, no, she's opposed.Does this indicate that she really has become more left due to Bernie Sanders?MCCAIN: I don't think she's as left as she's pretending to be right now. I want to read this quote, because I thought it was fascinating. When she announced her run for Senate 16 years ago, she said, quote, ""I don't believe government is the source of all our problems or the solution to them."" Now, that is not the ideology that Bernie Sanders and his supporters are espousing right now. It doesn't sound like the candidate we know now.The question remains whether or not a more centrist, hawkish Democrat will be able to, you know, garner Bernie Sanders supporters. But I think she's a lot more centrist than she's letting on.WILLIAMS: Well, Tom, in fact, lots of people say to the pollsters that, you know, they think she's sort of a center-left person. But they don't think that she's a far left person. No matter what she says.SHILLUE: That's right. So I don't think this will hurt her at all, this primary process. Because most Americans don't know what right and left is. They don't know.There's a core group of Americans -- we are among them -- who talk about left and right and party politics all the time. Most people don't care. That's why Bernie is so popular, and he is so far left of the average American voter, about the way they see the country, about what they think is good.So we're not an ideological people. You know, we tend to like personalities, and they don't like Hillary's. That's her problem. Not her ideology.WILLIAMS: So Bolling, the contrary argument would be. There are some differences between Hillary and Bernie. For example, Bernie wants across- the-board Social Security hikes. Hillary Clinton says targeted for people who are in need.Or on something like guns, obviously, Bernie actually, I think, is to the right of Hillary on guns. And then you come to other issues like college tuition. Bernie says free college tuition for all. Hillary Clinton says, ""I'll help you with better loans so you don't get so burdened.""BOLLING: What, are we trying to figure out how left Hillary is?WILLIAMS: No, no. She -- I don't think there's any question she's been pushed by Bernie.GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: So -- so now you have Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Now Hillary Clinton has been on a couple of different sides when it comes to a lot of these debates: on Wall Street, on wars, on minimum wage.WILLIAMS: Right, right.BOLLING: And Donald Trump has been in different places, as well.So to try and define an ideology, how left is Hillary Clinton, is ridiculous, because then you're going to say how right is Donald Trump? A lot of people say some of the things he does aren't far right enough for him, too.Instead, stay on things like -- if you're a Republican, stay on things like how trustworthy? Do you want her as commander-in-chief when you can't even trust her? You don't know what she's done with her emails. More importantly, what -- if she's willing to lie to people, of the families of people who lost...GUILFOYLE: Benghazi.WILLIAMS: Oh, here we go.BOLLING: ... loved ones in Benghazi, to their face about a video when she knows very well -- if she's willing to do that, she's willing to lie about anything.And then the big one: the Clinton Foundation. This fund, there's so much corruption and graft and quid pro quo going on in there. Once you start unraveling that sweater, that's where you should focus.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: Well, Kimberly, Eric makes the case, forget the policy positions.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: Forget that she's been pushed left. Let's go to Donald Trump's speech next Monday. He's going to be attacking her and her husband, Bill Clinton...GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: ... in terms of saying -- what are you saying? They made a hedge fund out of their time in office. That they're just making money off of their public positions.GUILFOYLE: Well, and who is one of the first people to talk about influence peddling and the Clinton Foundation? You.WILLIAMS: Yes, sure. I think it's fair.GUILFOYLE: Yes. So that's just the beginning, because guess who else is going against Bill Clinton? Hillary Clinton. She wants to take down the crime bill that he put in; NAFTA and trade stuff that he supported. She's being pushed so far to the left, she's to the left now of Obama. She's to the left now of her husband.And she's already admitted that she doesn't have a clue what to do with the economy, because she's going to call Bill, the guy that she's going against on so many of the things that he did while he was president.WILLIAMS: But we live in different times...GUILFOYLE: And this is going to push play...WILLIAMS: ... is what they're saying.GUILFOYLE: ... because of Bernie Sanders. And that's why she's now saying, ""Hmm, maybe the United States is ready for a two-woman ticket."" So now she's going to try and seek, curry favor and bring someone maybe like Elizabeth Warren in.WILLIAMS: Yes. But I'm saying the Clinton people are saying, ""Well, you know, there's different types.""GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: Of course people are going to change your positions.GUILFOYLE: I hear you saying, now she's alienating herself. She can forget about, you know, the Midwest. That's key to the Republicans. She's going to go on a whole immigration and see if she can get minorities to help usher her in. Because she's going to be alienating some of these independents, because she's not going to be able to pull center like she should to be able to win in a general election. So she's got a lot of holes.WILLIAMS: All right. Hillary Clinton has tried to frame herself as a, well, normal person, just like you and me, but she has a bunch of elite celebrity one-percenters trying to help her get elected. Will that help or hurt her? Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MCCAIN: Hillary Clinton's made history, and her celebrity fan club is on cloud nine. The stars were out in full force on Twitter last night, Ellen DeGeneres tweeting, ""I've never been prouder to have a woman card."" Katy Perry said, ""A lot of little girls are in bed right now dreaming for the first time without limits. You broke the mold, Hillary Clinton."" And Elizabeth Banks said, ""Very emotional about Hillary Clinton securing the nomination. Historic moment for American women.""So let's talk a little bit now about the celebrity factor. Will the rich and famous help Hillary in the general election. Tom, you're a very famous comedian. Does it help?SHILLUE: No, it does not help. Americans are obsessed with celebrities, but they don't really like them. It's like junk food. You know, we know it's bad for us, but we eat it anyway.And I think that, when you stand next to a celebrity, you think it's going to rub off on you. But then we just look, it looks like you're standing there with junk food. It's not good.MCCAIN: Yes. Kimberly, what do you say?GUILFOYLE: You know, it's funny, because the people that came out with these, it was a very organized effort that came out with these tweets. Elizabeth Banks and people that have supported Hillary have been very passionate about her. They've done a lot of events for her. You see them in the photo ops. They all came on stage for the big women's event for Hillary.So I mean, if you like them, OK, fine. But you also have to be someone who's going to make up your own mind, you know, for yourself. Personal responsibility. Is this somebody who shares your values? Understand the issues; watch the debates. Watch Bret Baier tonight with Hillary Clinton. And see, you know, if she's speaking to you.MCCAIN: Eric, when you go in the voting booth, do you care about Katy Perry?BOLLING: Certainly not. But I think a lot of people do, and I think the celebrity vote will help her.And I'm very -- I'm thrilled that America nominated a female. Our first female nominated -- nomination for president. That's fantastic. Now go with what's best for the country. I mean, there's a lot going down in the next four or eight years, the Supreme Court most importantly.But the celebrity stuff. So these two are going to hit the talk show circuits. Right? The night stuff. For probably the first time ever, the Republican might do better than the Democrat on the late-night talk circuit, because Donald Trump can say -- keep his own with Jimmy Fallon and Kimmel...GUILFOYLE: A hundred percent. And ""Saturday Night Live"" hosting.BOLLING: ... and all of them, ""SNL.""GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: This is going to be fun to watch. I mean, ""SNL,"" as you point out, is going to be just absolutely great for the next five months. I can't wait to see it.MCCAIN: What about you, Juan?WILLIAMS: I think it helps. I think, you know, gosh, I think there's a reason that Donald Trump wanted Bobby Knight's endorsement in Indiana. I mean, people who don't follow politics intently, you were talking about this earlier. They look to a lot of these celebrities as influentials, right? They can -- their names carry weight, and then people respond to them in a way. I think it's people who are less informed about what's actually going on in politics.But does it matter? Yes, it matters. It really does matter.GUILFOYLE: He's an icon, and that's also...SHILLUE: He's a coach. That's not the same as a celebrity.WILLIAMS: Katy Perry? Taylor Swift? How about these people?SHILLUE: She didn't coach anybody.GUILFOYLE: I mean...WILLIAMS: Well, I'm going to coach you up, Tom.GUILFOYLE: ... they moved me on my Pandora, Sonos (ph) radio thing, but other than that.WILLIAMS: But you know what's striking is I think Republican women are on the defensive, you two.GUILFOYLE: Why?WILLIAMS: I think that's why you don't like this, because women -- I think these are liberal Democratic women who are rallying to Hillary Clinton, saying it was historic.GUILFOYLE: But that's what we're -- no, we're not saying it's not historic, Juan. Of course it is. I mean, that's, like, without question.The point is what is the measure of it? And I'm saying that I would be super excited, you know, do a little jumping jack if it was someone like Condoleezza Rice that I was very inspired by and think would be an amazing president. And also, based on her national security and foreign policy experience, competency, qualifications, ethics, integrity. Shall I go on? I mean come on. She's not the one with 50 scandals.WILLIAMS: So this means you're voting for Hillary? Did you say experience in foreign policy?GUILFOYLE: Condoleezza Rice.WILLIAMS: Experience in foreign policy. I thought you were...GUILFOYLE: And a good golfer.MCCAIN: I think we should all agree that Clint Eastwood should just stay away from Donald Trump this time around, though. That's the one celebrity I could live without.WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.MCCAIN: All right.WILLIAMS: You don't hold a grudge, do you?GUILFOYLE: Where's the chair?MCCAIN: No chair.""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: All right. It's time now for ""One More Thing."" And it's a big night on the FOX News Channel, because our very own Greta Van Susteren will be on at 7 with a fantastic interview. And you've been reading and watching this story. She's going to sit down with the Swedish student who's being hailed as a hero in that Stanford University rape case for his role in stopping a former college student from further sexually assaulting his unconscious victim. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARL-FREDRIK ARNDT, STOPPED RAPE IN PROGRESS: And I essentially called the guy out and after a while, after a brief, like, conversation, the guy decided to run. And my friend Peter chased after him. Then I quickly tended to her and then helped Peter restrain him until the police came.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. And that is Greta, one-on-one with Carl-Fredrik Arndt. And he is the Swedish hero. So you want to check that out. She'll be on right after Bret Baier's interview with Hillary Clinton tonight.All right, Meghan.MCCAIN: I'll definitely be watching that.My ""One More Thing"" is happy birthday to former first lady, Barbara Bush. She's my favorite former first lady, an American icon. She's 91 today. Her husband turns 91 on Sunday.GUILFOYLE: God bless them, right? What a great family.MCCAIN: I love her.BOLLING: Great.MCCAIN: I know. She's my favorite first lady. I love her.BOLLING: Ninety-one, God bless them both.GUILFOYLE: They're class acts. You know? That's...MCCAIN: American icons.GUILFOYLE: Yes. Exactly.Mr. Bolling, what do you have for us?BOLLING: OK, ready for it? This happened last night. Now start rolling the tape of 00 there's two parts. First part is a ball inside. Now three balls inside. That's Arturo Ventura throwing at Manny Machado last night. Manny pops up, and now watch them jawing back and forth right here.After three balls inside, he pops up. He doesn't like it.All right. So Manny comes up the next time and, look...GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.BOLLING: ... he gets plunked with a 99-mile-an-hour fastball.GUILFOYLE: That's it.BOLLING: Benches clear. Boom, Manny nails Ventura with a right on that one.So there will be suspensions, and there will be fines likely. But get this, guys, two things: after the brawl, after the game resumed, the next two Oriole batters got up and went yard. Hit home runs, back to back right after that. No. 2...GUILFOYLE: So the game MVP?BOLLING: ... they play each other tonight again, and Machado is in the lineup. So stay tuned to that one.WILLIAMS: Yes, I tell you. Bad blood.GUILFOYLE: Ay dios mia.WILLIAMS: yes.GUILFOYLE: OK, bad blood, too. OK, fine.All right. What do we got?SHILLUE: It's me, right?GUILFOYLE: Barber-shop quartet?SHILLUE: You know those gas-powered leaf blowers? A lot of people hate them. Some of my neighbors complain about them. They're banned in several states. But I've got a solution. If it's blowing in B-flat, just sing with it.GUILFOYLE: I knew it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHILLUE (singing all four parts in a split screen): Welcome back home. Welcome home.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK, one of your mouths wasn't moving. The one in the top.SHILLUE: The leaf blower.GUILFOYLE: It was like this.SHILLUE: I'm a gentleman. I let the leaf blower sing lead.GUILFOYLE: Charming indeed. OK.WILLIAMS: I just hope you don't do that on Saturday mornings when some people are trying to sleep.SHILLUE: I'm improving the leaf blower.WILLIAMS: OK, OK.GUILFOYLE: Is that what it is?OK, Juan, what do you have for us? More pictures?WILLIAMS: OK, I want everybody to check out this terrifying video of a mom saving her 13-year-old daughter from an alleged kidnapper in Hernando, Florida, yesterday.The 30-year-old suspect, Craig Bonito (ph), can be seen in the video in a tug of war with the mom. He's pulling the girl, trying to get her away, and the mom is trying to hold onto her daughter. Bonito (ph) ran out of the store, but he did so just as an off-duty police officer was pulling up. He caught the guy. The good news: neither mom or daughter was hurt.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. What a hero. I would have beat him to death with a shopping cart.WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.GUILFOYLE: In a nice way.Set your DVRs so you never miss an episode of ""The Five."" That's it for us.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" September 13, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children. And my daughter, Ivanka, is going to be involved. She is the one that has been pushing for it so hard. ""Daddy, daddy, we have to do this,"" and it's true.REP. PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I don't think people asked me to be speaker so that I can take more money from hardworking taxpayers to create some new federal entitlement.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, that sound bite from the House Speaker, Paul Ryan, is from a year ago talking about possibly family leave, asked about that. And this you heard Donald Trump talking about what he's proposing, which is six weeks of childcare. In this plan, a number of things. The Trump childcare affordability plan allows for working parents to deduct childcare from income taxes, offers childcare spending rebates, creates dependent care savings accounts, adds incentives for childcare at work, and guarantees six weeks' paid maternity leave. Some estimates have it at about $158 billion. And the question is, often in Washington, how do you pay for it?Let's bring in our panel tonight: Tim Farley, host of ""Morning Briefing POTUS"" on Sirius XM radio; Mercedes Schlapp, columnist for The Washington Times, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.It's not a plan, Tim, that you traditionally think a Republican, especially at this stage, is pitching. He says Ivanka is really pitching it, his daughter, and I think they think it's going to help with women.TIM FARLEY, SIRIUS XM RADIO: You don't mean that Donald Trump is departing from Republican orthodoxy, do you?BAIER: He might. He might be.FARLEY: I can hardly believe this could be happening.From a political standpoint, and that's the filter I use, he is trying to reach a demographic that he needs to reach, white suburban women. It's clear. And from a political standpoint it makes sense. Anything he does that seems presidential, he's doing policy instead of the typical ad campaign, the ad hoc and ad hominem, which this is a bit ad hoc, but hopefully there's no ad hominem for him.The bad thing when he's doing policy is that he sounds like he's reading it for the first time, and he will be reading a speech tonight, especially if Ivanka helped him draw it up, which means that he's going to sound like a tenth grader reading a birthday card and trying to read the poetry. It's just not going to come out smoothly. It's not going to be practiced. And as a result of that it's going to be a tough political thing to do.But the bigger problem is, as you mentioned, he's talking about six weeks of guaranteed childcare. And that is something that's never going to pass. Some scoring of this said it might cost $10 trillion over 10 years, and you can hardly imagine that would ever get through. It's aspirational. A lot of campaigns are throwing out promises. So, you know, maybe it's not a bad thing. But --BAIER: Yes, supporters like Newt Gingrich say that he's really the best at this teleprompter kind of interaction between on and off. Does it move the needle, this plan, with women?MERCEDES SCHLAPP, ""WASHINGTON TIMES"": Well, what it does is that the plan is able to create the dialogue, especially with those suburban moms that have been on the fence about Donald Trump. I mean, he's taking a Democrat issue, gift wrapping it, and making it into a Republican type of policy.The problem is Republicans for too long have been talking about deficits. Slash and burn the budget. That doesn't sell. We can remember Ryan and Romney in 2012 when they were talking about entitlement cuts -- fell flat. This is an opportunity to talk about an issue that is popular. You're talking about 72 percent of women support paid family leave. You're talking about the fact that these are real concerns for women in terms of childcare expenses being so high. So I think it is a very smart move by Donald Trump to talk about this issue, which has been in the Democrat field. And it's time for Republicans to really be able to propose bold solutions and figure out how they're going to manage it with federal spending.BAIER: You know, I interviewed Governor Pence last night right here, Charles. And he today met with House lawmakers up on the Hill and senators as well. And the issue is, is it an issue for the national debt that stands at $19 trillion, heading to $20 trillion? And is that an issue even though maybe it doesn't sell, as Mercedes suggests, is there concern about it?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, Trump, himself, is the one who brings up the deficit and the debt all the time as a sign of our decline, a sign of having government out of control and having incompetence in government.Look, I think this raises the question of how many Democratic parties does the country need? We already have one. And I thought during the primary season, the argument for Trump was he was a guy who would stand up to the Washington Republican sold-out establishment that refused to stand up to Barack Obama on higher spending, refused to stand up to him on entitlements, refused to stand up to him on executive actions, and therefore we needed an outsider, a disrupter named Donald Trump, who would not do this.What he is proposing is to out-Democrat the Democrats. This is an enormous new entitlement. It will blow the debt. And when he says the mandate, he's going to mandate from Washington -- isn't that the one thing that Republicans all agree upon of the government stepping in and telling private industry what to do? He says that will be paid for by taking out waste, fraud, and abuse from the unemployment insurance system. If you believe that, you will believe anything.BAIER: So when Pence says today, Tim, that he wants to rebuild the military, Donald Trump does, revive the American economy, uphold the rule of law, and the agenda House Republicans have put forward, so that does not include Paul Ryan's budget?FARLEY: It sounded to me like a bad caption on a newspaper picture that was the wrong caption for the picture, because I was wondering which candidate he was talking about, because it certainly wasn't Donald Trump. I mean, Donald Trump does talk about making the military stronger, but all those other elements you're talking about exactly go away from what Paul Ryan has been pushing so hard for.SCHLAPP: I think you going to see it could be an alliance between Speaker Ryan and, let's say, a president Donald Trump. They know they need each other although they don't want to necessarily be with each other. But I think, Bret, that at this point it is an opportunity for them to realize that in order to push any Republican proposal, they're going to need Ryan being in the House as speaker. And he'll fight back against Donald Trump at times. I mean, there will be moments -- there will be tension between these two parties.BAIER: All right, I want to talk about President Obama on the trail today, but I do want to talk about Bill Clinton and his interview with CBS talking about the health issue with Secretary Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: She's been, well, as it is, it's a mystery to me and all of her doctors because frequently -- not frequently, that's not -- rarely, but on more than one occasion over the last many, many years, the same sort of thing's happened to her when she just got severely dehydrated. And she's worked like a demon.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So, Bill Clinton said, you know, you saw him catch himself, frequently to rarely. ""CBS Evening News"" edited out the ""frequently"" part. And they put out a statement today. ""The clip in question from former President Clinton's interview on Charlie Rose ran its entirety on CBS this morning, and their online services. One clip that ran on ""CBS Evening News"" was edited purely for time while on deadline for the live broadcast."" I'm not sure if they saved a second or a second and half, but Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: This is a real day for ""if you believe that, you believe anything."" It makes you really want to walk away in disgust from politics and the media. That is an outright -- well, I won't call it a lie. That is not a believable statement. As you say, it's a second or two. It isn't a question of the time. They were covering for them. And the reason it's important, it's a slip, yes, but it wasn't -- it's in the context of a couple who hide stuff. They've been hiding stuff for 30 years, and what everybody is asking, are they hiding something more serious? The frequently and the rarely is a huge difference, and he said both. So which is true? You have to see them if you're going to make a choice.BAIER: Maureen Dowd on Fox last night, Tim, on Megyn Kelly's show, said it's the stuff, not the health.(LAUGHTER)FARLEY: That makes sense. It's always the cover-up rather than the crime itself, and not necessarily there's a crime here. I talked to Brian Fallon this morning and asked him about, you know, with the campaign, and asked him about this particular moment. He said, well, yes, it was a mistake.The question is, is the mistake going to be learned? Because it doesn't sound like it is. They changed the story a couple different times about when Mrs. Clinton was diagnosed.You mentioned President Obama, I don't mean to get ahead, but when you talked about him on the campaign trail today, it was actually a treat. And in some ways what struck me about him being out there, he hit a lot of the right notes. He mentioned Donald Trump, got the word ""70"" in there, talked about true, that Hillary Clinton is true. He didn't say ""truthful"" but he said ""true"" which had a nice little subliminal effect. But given the way that he approached it, he's able to speak as someone who's delivering the speech, but he's able to interact with the audience. It was just a reminder Republicans don't have anyone who can hold a candle to him, and, by the way, neither do the Democrats.BAIER: He's good on the trail.SCHLAPP: Very much.BAIER: Clearly. The question is whether his high approval ratings now transfer to Hillary Clinton.SCHLAPP: My recommendation is Hillary Clinton should just stay on bed rest as long as she can and have President Obama go out there, because his approval ratings are so high. He knows how to deliver. He is the candidate in chief. It is what he's effective at. It's what he loves to do is go out there and be on the campaign trail. And he's able to make a case for Hillary Clinton to say she's strong enough, too.BAIER: Approval ratings, though, Charles, are not approval of his policies.KRAUTHAMMER: Exactly. That's what we saw in the midterm elections. He said I'm not on the ballot, my policies are two years ago, and he got shellacked, in his own words.But look, he and Bill Clinton are the two world champion political seducers of our time, except that Bill is slightly over the hill. I mean, he's been the world champion, but he's been in retirement and he's rusty, and he made that slip. He makes a lot of slips. But Obama is a guy who came out of nowhere, and his popularity is a real help to her. It won't translate, but he's not going to be a drag the way two-term incumbents for anybody who succeeds them.BAIER: He can fire up his coalition.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

The problem is we're still spending I think because of this large military governmental organization build up over the years, we're still spending despite World War II kind of fights. We have combat ships that cost millions. The Defense Department doesn't want them. The government doesn't want them and yet these individual districts where they are built we keep building them because that is their meal ticket. We divert some of that money, not all of it into fighting today's wars, which is ISIS and terrorism. And we have plenty of money there.Ashley Pratte: I think at this point we need to look at every possible option because clearly ISIS is not contained. And yesterday the CIA director came out and said ISIS is as dangerous as ever, which really squashes that liberal narrative that is out that that says we are doing enough to protect ourselves. Because ISIS is at war with us and radical Islam is in at war with us what we believe in is, our values and freedoms and way of life in America everywhere is the target. Makes the cost extremely high to secure the American people. At the same time, all of this stuff, there are going to be major crackdowns now and I think there needs to be because of the time we're living in. If we can't clearly define the enemy, that becomes problem number one.Julie Rodginsky: You are right. And Gary, Ashley is right. The difference between us and Israel is a much geographically larger with a lot more soft targets and reality is you can't protect them all. There are place likes Disney and the empire state building that make a lot of sense. But this nightclub was one out of a million places that could have been hit. It happened to have been an LGBT nightclub but there are thousands across the world and across the city and across the state and the country. And the problem here is that where do you stop? Where do you stop spending money to secure every soft target? There is not enough money, imagination or personnel to do that effectively.John Layfield: I think Julie is right. America is such a large diverse country that it is tough. Especially a lone wolf you are talking about. And we don't need more conventional warfare. We need bytes right now. Not bullets. We had a coordination problem between intelligence agencies. That's been pretty much fixed. But if you talk to the FBI right now there are some simple things that we can do that can be done without a whole lot of money. And that is communication. And that is better and not delayed between the federal and local agencies and we also can go and declare war on ISIS and that way it is no longer a matter of free speech with these companies. Now it is a matter that they are a declared enemy. A couple of things we can do can go a long way. I think we have to switch to a new war and that is on our shore and it is bytes not bullets.Jonas Max Ferris: If they had more people just investigate more people. I don't know. This is what we have to stop. Moving the money from somewhere because there isn't really a solution. Like I don't know how you go about -- like I think someone in politics has to say you can't really solve this problem with more money necessarily. I like the idea of taking it out of the, say, the multi-billion dollar nuclear submarine program which we probably don't need anymore. There are 65,000 night clubs in America. You are not going make them all secure. Even if you had all that money out of the programs. I think you have to do -- during the gangland wars in the '20s and '30s they decided to raise taxes on guns that criminals used and $3,500 taxes. So there are ways to theoretically lower the ability of terrorists to get things and make money for the government. Not just spend more money vaguely with some notion of hardening targets.New Debate Over Socialism as Crisis in Venezuela EscalatesJohn Layfield: It makes no sense. Sounds great to a bunch of young unemployed kids but it never works in reality. Chavez ruined a beautiful country of Venezuela by promising riches to the masses that obviously this model imploded on him. Every innovation and every invention almost has come out of a free market. The train to airplane to car the mobile phone to computer all of this because of free markets because that simply couldn't happen in socialism.Jonas Max Ferris: Norway is an oil rich country that supports everybody but it has ways of doing the rules and regulations to make market sense. The problem with this country is they would just decree we have to sell this drink for 50 cents but the cost of making it is $2 so it goes out of business. They didn't just seize it or tax it or have royalty taxes like Russia and others. It was just completely irrational populist garbage. It doesn't make any sense. But it works with the private market and is functional and what this did was just insanity. So let's not mix it up with what it really is.Ashley Pratte: Feel the Bern. What I'm thinking right now is socialism in Venezuela is literally killing people. Food shortage, medicine shortages. Doctor shortages. Electricity, all of the above. And yet we are talking about bringing this here. And on paper it sounds great, give us everything for free but it is not economically sustainable. And at the end of the day socialist ideas have consequences and it is all on the better promise of a better quality of life which in Venezuela's case did not happen and that is going to happen here because you run up a massive debt and the economy falls into the shambles and it is not sustainable.Julie Rodginsky: I'm not a huge fan of Bernie sanders but I don't think he's talking about setting up the means of production, seizing it. Setting up and basically nationalizing the banks and nationalizing every single aspect of our free market. That's certainly something he's never talked about doing. So anybody is talking about socialism coming to the United States, somebody who lived in the socialist country as the little kid. I know what socialism is.Gary B. Smith: Well here is the problem. I don't think, I agree with Julie a little bit, but I don't think Sanders is proposing that. I think Sanders is proposing some sort of Scandinavian model he thinks is utopia. If you spend even five minutes with that, a lot of those countries are more capitalistic than we are. In fact they are against the very much things the feel the western people want. Scandinavian countries are big free traders not. Government mandated minimum wage. School vouchers for crying out loud. Denmark in some reports is more economically free than we are. So even if you say we want the same model as Sweden, I'd say go towards that. But that is not socialism. That is some hybrid between socialism and capitalism. If you want Sanders to call himself a socialist Democrat -- if that is what the feel the Bern people think they are going to get they are sadly wrong.Democratic Lawmaker: Drug Test the Rich Before Approving Tax DeductionsAshley Pratte: No. This is ridiculous. Tax breaks allow people to keep their money. Welfare is when tax breaks are given out to people. So yes there should be requirements in place for welfare recipients that make sense. It is federal government money being given out to individuals. Tax breaks and allows you do keep your money. That is a big difference I see.Julie Rodginsky: A dumb idea but also as dumb as testing people for drugs. You're essentially implying anybody on welfare is a drug dictate which is offensive to them. And those on welfare are much less likely to be on drugs than the average person not receiving welfare. So if you want to test people on welfare, test people who got the Wall Street bail out for their cocaine problems despite taxpayer dollars paying to keep them on Wall Street too.Gary B. Smith: This must be my half hour of Julie lovefest. Because I agree with her in this case and that is going to be a rarity, believe me. But the fact is this is, I hate the government intrusion. It is not the government's job. If you are going to test for drugs, test for alcohol, obesity, things like that. It is always a slippery slope where the government wanting to examine things you are doing, wanting to -- let's separate government intrusion from government welfare and tax policy.John Layfield: And if you are going to test somebody, test Congress for stupidity. This is ignorant. I've been broke and I am proudly now in the 1 percent. I worked very hard to get here. And am proud of that fact and I have been drug tested for 30 years. I continue to get drug tests. You want to give me a check. You want to drug test me, that is your prerogative. I feel the same way about welfare recipients are.Jonas Max Ferris: What is the difference? There is really no difference over your lifetime. So I don't want to get into that topic. I will say I'm open to soda taxes but this doesn't make any sense for so many reasons because drugs are expensive and I don't even know if there is a high percentage of use by really poor people.Stock PicksGary B.
