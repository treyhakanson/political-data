This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Boling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Melissa Francis and Jesse Watters, it's 5 o'clock in New York City and this right here is ""The Five.""(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Well, the word of the day maybe the word of the month in GOP politics is process. Many voters are worried about the GOP process of nominating their candidate, allegations of delegates stealing fierce of contested convention shenanigans and more. Over the weekend, the Colorado state GOP convention took place and Ted Cruz scored a total victory, taking all 34 delegates, that without a single vote cast by a Coloradan -- the process, folks. Anyway, Colorado shrinks the lead, the front-runner Donald Trump has over Ted Cruz to less than 200 delegates. But with a week and a day until the delegate reach New York state primary, that gap is said to widen further as Trump holds a more than 30 point lead. Yesterday, however, Trump was pulling no punches on the process.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The system is corrupt. And it's worse on the republican side, because I'm up millions of votes on Cruz, millions. I don't mean like I'm up by two votes. I'm up millions and millions of votes. We've got a corrupt system, it's not right. We're supposed to be a democracy. We're supposed to be -- we're supposed to be you vote, and the vote means something.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Well, Cruz, of course firing back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald has been yelling and screaming.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: A lot of whining.(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: I'm sure some cursing.(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: And some late night fevered tweeting.(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: All the characteristics I would note we would want in a commander-in- chief.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, KG, bring us up to speed. A big weekend for Ted Cruz, he got all 34 Colorado votes.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: He did. And you know --BOLLING: Delegates.GUILFOYLE: But this is also kind of what Trump is doing is really pushing for that narrative like don't disenfranchise people, cast a vote, make it count this process. And he's kind of setting the tone for the argument might be, if he goes to a contested convention to say, we don't want to do politics like this, we want people's votes, rights, who they want to vote for, to be listened to and counted. So Colorado, he was making it more along the, you know, lyin' Ted narrative, sneaky Ted narrative. Oh, he went and stole the votes from Colorado, what about the people in Colorado.BOLLING: Do you wanna --GUILFOYLE: To see if that sticks.BOLLING: Do you want to talk just a little bit about the process? I mean, look -- that is the process, like it or not.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . it's Colorado, they decided that way. The delegates are going to be deciding who they're going to vote for the nominee process --JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Right. Well, they cancelled the straw vote.BOLLING: Yup.WILLIAMS: And what they did was they did it by congressional district.BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: And then they had this weekend, the party, the Colorado state Republican Party convention, and that's where you see that when you don't have the infrastructure, you don't have the players on the ground, when you don't know the rules of the game, guess what, you lose. And not only lose, completely lose, 34 to nothing. So this is what, you know, Paul Manafort, who Trump has brought on now to handle this kind of, you know, shepherd his delegate -- handling responsibility and said, OK, forget about it, because we even send in ballots with the wrong names on it. We didn't tell people who were the Trump delegates in Colorado. He admitted the mistakes. He said not -- not going forward, give him a week or so, he's going to get this together. But for right now, you got to say, those are the rules of the game and you lost. You can't just -- I mean, Manafort says Gestapo tactics.BOLLING: Yeah, yeah. He did it and on the ""Meet the Press"" interview with Chuck Todd, I did create a lot of firestorm of Twitter activity after he said that. On the other side, let's talk the other side of the process.MELISSA FRANCIS, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah.BOLLING: . comes to New York State, a week from Tuesday, and all of a sudden you get 52 percent of the vote. And you basically have a chance at every single 95 delegates available.FRANCIS: That's true. And that would be another 100, you know, right there, but it really does stress that point to. I think average people who haven't necessarily followed the process so closely, how sort of tied up, and intricate, and political it really is. I was just talking to somebody who was a delegate in Colorado, and she was saying, you know, four months, there have been calls and meetings and this and that. And the other thing that she's been approached by everyone. Not a word from Trump. You know, he has no infrastructure and he's just kind of counting on that megaphone which works really effectively in places like New York where he is really well-known and where it has this kind of a nominating process. But in a place like Colorado, it doesn't count at all. And to Americans in other states, I think it's kind of shocking that this is how it works.BOLLING: You know what shocking to me Jesse is that, what we see, the process we're seeing, I frankly didn't even realize it was this way, that the votes, when people stand in line and they vote for somebody, it's really not even a vote.JESSE WATTERS, ""WATTERS' WORLD"" HOST: No.BOLLING: It's kind of a recommendation.WATTERS: That's right.FRANCIS: Yes.WATTERS: But I suggest you do this, but there's no strings attached.FRANCIS: True.WATTERS: It's corrupt. But Trump knew it was corrupt, and he got (inaudible). This is what they do in the Soviet Union, they cancel votes, and they have some guy in the background pick the nominee. It's very undemocratic, especially in a year that's so consequential. But you said it, Trump knew the game.FRANCIS: Right.WATTERS: And if Trump is going to be the guy as the deal-maker. You know, go make some deals, get your face in there. Maybe promise some free round at Trump national.FRANCIS: Whatever.WATTERS: Cover to sweet in the deal or at least twist arms, he didn't do any of that. So it's little sad to see him complain, but he knew the rules of the game.BOLLING: Right, let's do this. John Kasich has only 143 delegates; that's fewer than Marco Rubio who dropped out last month. He's won only one state -- his own, but he is still pitching himself as the most electable candidate in the republican race.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KASICH, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm the only one that consistently beats Hillary Clinton in the fall. And there is great concern in the Republican Party that we're not just talking about the presidential race, that frankly, if we get blown out in the fall, which I think we would with both Cruz and Trump, we could lose the United States Senate, we would lose seats all the way from the State House to the courthouse.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: An interesting concept now, what is he -- is Kasich saying -- by the way, that's why you have to hope Trump doesn't get 1237, so that he wins, and therefore, save the House and the Senate.WILLIAMS: Right. Well, let's just give Kasich a little tip of the hat, he's running second in New York to Trump, so he's way ahead of Cruz. Now, who would have thought that? But given the rhetoric we're hearing from Cruz, everybody said --KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: New York values.WATTERS: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Yeah, well, whatever. But I'm saying Kasich is in the New York right now. Let's just be clear. Eric said earlier, he's 32 points behind Donald Trump, so don't confuse it. But he's ahead -- he's ahead of Ted Cruz. So what he's trying to do is appeal to party unity, specifically in the argument he made in the latter half of his statement about the impact on Senate races, the impact on House races, and then he said down to the courthouse that many of the party elders are worried about the Trump-Cruz effect down on ballot. And so that's his -- that that is best argument, his hope as he said is, for an open convention.BOLLING: Not because he -- he's been saying he's the only one who matches up nicely against Hillary.WILLIAMS: Well, that may be the case, I don't know if that's true.BOLLING: KG, nationally, that's really wild.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, yeah.BOLLING: Nationally, 63 percent think that the candidate with the most delegates at the convention, not the majority, just the most delegates, nationally. They think that's the candidate that should be the nominee.GUILFOYLE: Right. That sounds kind of fair.BOLLING: Go to Wisconsin where Trump lost soundly. Handily, he lost. 56 percent of the Wisconsin voters said the candidate with the most delegates should be the nominee, not necessarily majority. And then National Review, I think one more number. National Review who hates Trump, they put up a poll that, by the way, I went on and logged on to, 68 percent agree with that. So clearly, the American public, at least the GOP side says if you got the majority going -- I'm sorry, if you have the plurality going into the convention, you should be the nominee.GUILFOYLE: Well, right. Well, that sounds pretty fair, doesn't it? It sounds like Americans and voters and republicans in this primary are interested in fairness, and the voting -- votes being counted in a proper way and not to mean like, you know, stealing it in the middle of the night. As for like John Kasich, I was saying earlier. I think he's like the honey badger, right? He doesn't care. He's going to stay in --(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: He doesn't care. It doesn't matter if he gets stung like a thousand times by bees. He was like, gets back up. And he's like hey, I can beat Hillary. But you know what, anything can happen in politics, he's -- as you said, he's in second place, so every week something's different here, but let's see. I think in the end, it's going to be a very tough argument to knock out somebody if they have the most delegates.BOLLING: It'll get -- will it?FRANCIS: Yeah, I think the rules are the rules. I mean, it's not the person who has the most delegates when you show up at the convention, if they don't get over the threshold. You can't change the rules because you don't like how it turned out. I mean, I know the majority of Americans may feel that way, and maybe when those delegates are going in there and they're casting their ballots, they could think about that, but it's still -- you have to play by the rules as they are. As for Kasich, I mean the honey badger thing.GUILFOYLE: Honey badger.FRANCIS: . just makes me laugh (inaudible) because -- so this is his latest plea. You know, he said the April calendar plays in our favor. We're looking to finish strong and win some more delegates. Like not win the whole thing, because it's not possible. But we're going to win, you know, maybe one or two more.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: War of attrition.FRANCIS: We can do it.BOLLING: But Jesse, the rules aren't even made yet. They make the rules.WATTERS: Right.BOLLING: . at the convention -- for that convention.WATTERS: Yeah. I don't know. I think you got to stick with the rules that we have going in, but at the same time, who's to say you can't change them in four years. But if you're going to change rules, I don't trust guys in a smoke filled room to change the rules the right way. And like you said, the public wants the plurality; you can go with the public. But I don't think this party's ever he going with the public.GUILFOYLE: Right.WATTERS: They do with the big they want.GUILFOYLE: But you also set your game --WATTERS: And that's how it's going to play.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, and he's right. You set up your game plan based on what the rules are the parameters, the guidelines. Like when you go in to play football, you expect that there's going to be four quarters, right? You're not going to expect.WATTERS: Right.GUILFOYLE: . that you're going to be hey, let's just cut this off at three because we didn't like, you know, you had momentum going-forward, we don't want that team to win. It's just abusing.WILLIAMS: You know what's interesting is that, in fact, Trump and Cruz want to use the rules against Kasich, because the old rules say, that unless you've won eight states, you can't be the nominee.FRANCIS: Because they want to throw that out.WILLIAMS: They want to get him out this convention.FRANCIS: Like everybody --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: That's why you have rules, because everybody wants to win all the time. You can't rewrite them. I mean, you have to set the rules ahead of time, because obviously, everybody in here wants to be the nominee and wants to be the president. This is why people hate politics.(LAUGHTER)FRANCIS: So you think you know what you're talking about. And then all of a sudden it's like, oh no, look here, not you.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.BOLLING: And really, that is it. Rule 40, there's 42 rules in the RNC, the 42nd rule says, the half -- more than half of the rules, the ones that really count are deemed temporary. And they'll figure out what the real --(LAUGHTER)WATTERS: Right.BOLLING: What the permanent rule is going to be a week before the convention.FRANCIS: That's why hate politics.BOLLING: Are you kidding me? So all this --GUILFOYLE: This sounds like a different country, doesn't it?BOLLING: You wait in line, five hours, you put your vote in and it becomes a recommendation when it gets to the convention.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: Someone who is not even running right now might end up being --WATTERS: Rubio. Hey --WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.WATTERS: It looks like Rubio could win this whole thing.BOLLING: Do you know why that --FRANCIS: But Watters, how about Watters?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Think about this for one second.WATTERS: Yeah.BOLLING: If Marco Rubio is doing what John Kasich is doing, you got to think that's the play that the GOP is going to go for.WATTERS: Rubio is going to say, listen, I beat Hillary head to head, bigger than I'll be Kasich beats Hillary head to head.BOLLING: So why he dropped out?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Why did he really drop?WATTERS: He should have stuck in.WILLIAMS: Are you kidding me?WATTERS: He could have played king maker.WILLIAMS: No, no. He didn't want to play --BOLLING: Wait. He still has more delegates than --WILLIAMS: No. It doesn't matter.BOLLING: Kasich does.WILLIAMS: No, no, no.BOLLING: And more status.WILLIAMS: Right. But well --GUILFOYLE: How so you get one out --WILLIAMS: Right now, let's give --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Let's give everybody a realistic update on this.GUILFOYLE: OK.WILLIAMS: Right now, Donald Trump, even with the lead he has, would have to win more than 60 percent.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Well say by 60, some people have it higher, 60 percent or so -- I'll give you that, of the remaining delegates from now on, in order to get to 1237. And Paul Manafort said --BOLLING: What does Cruz need?WILLIAMS: I don't -- he need like --BOLLING: Eight -- 85 percent.WILLIAMS: Like 80 something -- yeah. And, by the way, Kasich needs a hundred and twenty. How is that possible, right? OK, but Paul Manafort also says that right now, he expects that this will go to California; that means June, that means no candidate, nobody will get to anything, even in the front-runner's top delegate counter's estimate by the California primary.BOLLING: Hang on to this. What would the media do if any other candidate had this happen to them? Check out this cover of the ""Boston Globe"" from yesterday. The paper created a fake front page, imagining what a Trump presidency might look like, and other media outlets actually covered the story as if it were real news. Now here's Trump reaction to this stunt.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: How about that stupid ""Boston Globe,"" it's worthless, sold for a dollar. Did you see that story? The whole front page, they made up a story that Trump, they pretended Trump is the president, and they made up the whole front page as a make believe story, which is really no different from the whole paper for the whole thing. I mean, the whole thing is made up.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Now Melissa, ""New York Times"" bought the ""Globe"" in '93.FRANCIS: Right.BOLLING: . for $1.1 -- get this, $1.1 billion.FRANCIS: Right.BOLLING: And sold it in 2013 for 70 -- they lost 94 percent of the value of that company.FRANCIS: That's right. I mean, it was bought eventually for what was it, $50 million. You can't even get an apartment in New York for $50 million.(LAUGHTER)FRANCIS: They got all the ""Boston Globe"" for that money. It's ridiculous. This is a classic Hail Mary from like you said a failing newspaper. That said, it is opinion, it is satire in the tradition of this country, so I can respect a stab at humor, and then, you know, (inaudible). I can't imagine them doing it to Bernie Sanders, though. I mean, they could have followed that logical conclusion, had people and you know, bread riots and.GUILFOYLE: Well, Hillary?FRANCIS: . well, becomes a socialist country.GUILFOYLE: Imagine they did it to Hillary Clinton?FRANCIS: Yeah --BOLLING: What's the -- I mean, OK. I get it. You want to have some fun. But like Melissa said, they're just -- are they that desperate for an eyeball?WILLIAMS: I don't think so.FRANCIS: We're all talking about it?WILLIAMS: You know, here in New York, the ""New York Daily News"" is on their own agenda going the tirade against Trump. You see this in newspapers. The Philadelphia papers have done it to some extent too. So Boston, New York, Philadelphia, what do you see it?BOLLING: Well, that would be --WILLIAMS: They think that Trump is running a campaign unlike any other, and they're willing to do things unlike (inaudible) say --FRANCIS: No, no.WILLIAMS: This guy --FRANCIS: No, no.WILLIAMS: . is a potential democrat.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: This is the whole front page.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: They didn't just do a fake and have a funny headline or afternoon headline.GUILFOYLE: It's not in the cartoon section.FRANCIS: I know --BOLLING: This is the whole front page, where they actually --FRANCIS: And the other big difference, Juan --WATTERS: I like --BOLLING: . every story.WATTERS: . deportations to begin. I think a lot of people in America would like that.WILLIAMS: Oh my goodness.FRANCIS: It's like the ""New York Times"" doing it.WATTERS: We're starting with you, Juan.WILLIAMS: Yes, you are.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: It's like the ""New York Times"" is doing, when you talk about the post and the daily news, like they have this back and forth, left and right.BOLLING: Right.FRANCIS: Where they're being kind of cheeky and they are being sarcastic, it's not normal.WILLIAMS: Yeah.FRANCIS: . for the ""Globe"" to the --WILLIAMS: The tabloid.FRANCIS: It would be like doing that the ""New York Times"" is doing something like that.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: You know what it reminds me? You know when this people are on their deathbed, and the obituary it says, you know, instead of flowers, vote against Barack Obama.(LAUGHTER)WATTERS: This is what the ""Globe"" is, they're dying. This is their last wish.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: That's right.BOLLING: . this one.FRANCIS: OK.BOLLING: I'm going to leave right there. Hillary Clinton lost the seventh straight time to Bernie Sanders this weekend. So why is she putting out new attack ads against Donald Trump on that. Plus, SNL's amazing takes on Hillary subway gaffe, coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The New York City subway is the best way to get around.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: It's been a while. Is this a working metro card?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Cab is the best way to get around.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my god, I love it. I hear you. That happened to me. All right, SNL had some fun with Hillary Clinton's subway ride -- I did it twice, last week. Now democratic front-runners campaign yet another snug over the weekend, she lost to Bernie Sanders in Wyoming, and he's fighting hard to catch up with her in New York City, which suppose next Tuesday. Clinton holds a big lead in her home state, but Bernie's has been working to narrow it by questioning her qualifications and now, her judgment as well.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BERNIE SANDERS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: A candidate who receives an enormous amount of money from special interests, a candidate who voted for the war in Iraq, a candidate who voted for virtually every disastrous trade policy, which have caused us millions of jobs. Well, you know what? Maybe her judgment is not quite as high as it should be. But John, I want to get away from this stuff. I respect Hillary Clinton. I've known her for 25 years. What I want is a debate about on the real issues, impacting the middle class of this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, Bernie, why did you pull it back in? Why did Bernie throttle back, Bolling? If you want to win, just be like, yes, bad judgment, lying, et cetera, et cetera. Don't vote.BOLLING: Yeah, because I don't think this is about Bernie. I think he realizes he can't beat Clinton on delegates. This is not about him trying to beat over (inaudible). It's going to happen. She's got 98 percent of the super delegates and they're not going to switch. Those are party - local party leaders who went out. They're kind of entrenched in their support for Hillary Clinton. That's the -- so she's going to get the nomination on delegates. I think he's hanging around to be a very likeable candidate in the event the catastrophic happens that she becomes -- she gets indicted somehow. It's becoming less and less likely as time goes, and President Obama gets on talk shows and we're not, and says nothing to see here. But, I think that's his game. I don't think he's going very negative on her, because -- I think that game -- that ship has sailed, now he's going to be the likeable Bernie Sanders that has a future in the Democratic Party going-forward.FRANCIS: I love the way the democrats do it, because he is just sort of like, she's trash, she's a liar, but I don't want to go there. You know, I don't want to say. I'm not going to day that about the candidate. I mean they can to say it then they real (ph) it back in. I can't believe that the Sanders folks aren't more hysterical. I mean, all these young people, they go to rallies and they vote, and vote, and vote, yet their votes don't count. He keeps winning but he can't possibly win. I mean I can only think that they're socialists, the people that are voting for Sanders. So by definition, they can't do math, so they don't realize like they don't have all these votes and they're not getting anywhere. I mean, it's amazing to me.GUILFOYLE: All right. Jesse --WATTERS: He's been beating around the bush, he wants to call her a liar and someone you can't trust, but he won't say that because he --BOLLING: Lyin' Hillary Clinton.WATTERS: Lyin' Hillary.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: He won't do it. So he's finally settled on bad judgment. And I think that's going to stick, because if you look at the three things he said, voted for the Iraq war, ""Wall Street"" money and disastrous trade bills.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: No, but in a democratic primary, those will destroy a nominee. The thing is, he's been late to attacking her and going dirty, just as the republicans waited too long to go dirty after Donald Trump. Now he's going dirty late and all that does is create chaos and deteriorate her standing as she goes into the convention.GUILFOYLE: OK. Pretty good, Jes, go ahead.WATTERS: Thank you.GUILFOYLE: Juan, beat that.WILLIAMS: You know what? I feel for Bernie Sanders on this, because I think it's not the case that he's won more primaries than she has won. He doesn't have more delegates than she was, but he has exceeded expectations. He's done tremendously well. And everybody, you know, from the newspapers to the party, never knew that Bernie Sanders was going to raise this much money. He's raised more money than Hillary Clinton. So it's been a phenomenal performance. But let me just say, she is actually winning. And as Eric points out, she's got just about a lock on the delegates. It's possible. It's possible.FRANCIS: No, no, Juan. Juan, they're like --WILLIAMS: . that new higher turnout.FRANCIS: If you look at this raw delegate count, they're like 200 apart.WILLIAMS: Right.FRANCIS: It's close. Then you add in the super delegates, and it's completely impossible, because those people are bought and paid for.WILLIAMS: But --FRANCIS: That's where the outrage is.WILLIAMS: Oh, oh, oh.FRANCIS: Because it's so close.WILLIAMS: Please, please, please.FRANCIS: And then she's got all these super delegates lined up that have --WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, wait.FRANCIS: They're like --WILLIAMS: Republican indignation here?FRANCIS: You have some --WILLIAMS: Bought and paid for delegates?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: It's true.WILLIAMS: Did I miss -- did I miss the first segment of ""The Five"" today? Where Eric was complaining about -- but anyway, let me just finish my point. Let me finish my point about the democrat.FRANCIS: Why is that have to do with me?WILLIAMS: Well, because I don't think if you're going to say they're bought and paid for, no. In fact Bernie --FRANCIS: They decided --WILLIAMS: No.FRANCIS: . before the people in their state voted, that they were going to support Hillary Clinton.WILLIAMS: They have --FRANCIS: Why do you do that? I mean, that's a backroom deal.WILLIAMS: Because they think it's the best interest of the party.FRANCIS: It's not even against the rules.WILLIAMS: But let me just say.FRANCIS: It gets --WILLIAMS: Bernie's strategy is, to those super delegates, Melissa, that if he can win New York, and then he can gain some momentum through the Acela card (ph) here in the east and then flip over to California and win California. There will be so much pressure, Trump like pressure at the --FRANCIS: Right, right, right.WILLIAMS: Republican convention, but in this case at the democratic convention.GUILFOYLE: Problem.WILLIAMS: . that the super delegates would have to --FRANCIS: Would be embarrassed.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: So losing seven in a row or 7 of 9 and then --WILLIAMS: These are smaller states, and their caucus -- like Wisconsin.BOLLING: I know, but that wouldn't be enough, though?WILLIAMS: Wisconsin is open independent.BOLLING: That wouldn't be enough? I mean --FRANCIS: A lot of people --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Here's the reality, though.WILLIAMS: He can win, if he can win in New York --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: One at a time, guys.BOLLING: Here's the reality and correct me if I'm wrong.WILLIAMS: Go ahead.BOLLING: These delegates are never going to flip.WILLIAMS: The super delegates?BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: No, they can flip.BOLLING: I know they can, but are they going to?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Look what happens -- it's like the --(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I mean, just in recent history in '08 with Obama and Hillary Clinton. They flip, they went to Barack Obama.GUILFOYLE: To follow up on your little like train metaphor thing, the problem is that Bernie Sanders and the Acela and the quiet train. He's not making enough noise.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: And in fact this is --you know what he said, you know what he said yesterday?GUILFOYLE: What?WILLIAMS: Basically, you know what, I'd like to do as well as I can. What does that translate as? I don't really expect to win New York.BOLLING: Right.FRANCIS: And I don't know even he wants to.GUILFOYLE: All right. Let's see.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: It's all about New York City next Tuesday. But coming up here, would the CIA's director defy the next commander-in-chief if his agency was ordered to waterboard terror suspects -- John Brennan's answer and Donald Trump's response, ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: When President Obama took office in 2009, he banned the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, like waterboarding, to get terror suspects to talk. Republican candidates like Trump and Cruz vowed they'd bring the program back. But the CIA's director said his agency would never implement it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: Absolutely I would not -- I would not agree to have any CIA officer carrying out waterboarding again.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Trump, of course, had missed the chance to issue a sharp response.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: They chop off heads and they drown people in cages with 50 in a cage and big steel, heavy cages, drop them right into the water, drown people, and we can't waterboard, and we can't do anything. And you know, we're playing on different fields and we have a fight -- a huge problem with ISIS, which we can't beat. And the reason we can't beat them is we won't use strong tactics, whether it's this or other things.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Bolling, I don't really take a lot of what he says seriously. This guy is more of a political guy. He's got a real --GUILFOYLE: Brennan?WATTERS: Real spy -- Brennan. I mean he got his e-mail hacked, he was caught lying to Congress. H won't even say radical Islam. Is he even going to be the next director of the CIA?BOLLING: No. In fact, there's a great -- I talked about this before, HBO has a thing called ""Spy Masters."" It interviews every single one of the living former CIA director.WATTERS: Right.BOLLING: And John Brennan was the one who you really saw, as you point out, who lined up very closely with President Obama's idea on terror, on interrogation, on everything CIA, intel operations or whatnot. It's just not necessary to do that right now.Aside from undermining the next president, why tell the bad guys what you're willing and what you're not willing to do. You should just look, step away from that. I do agree with you, whoever it is, most likely if it's a Republican president, they'll be someone who lines up a lot more with the Republican ideas of how they interrogate terrorists.GUILFOYLE: Yes. Getting stuff done, yes.WATTERS: Didn't they carve out an exception for the ticking time bomb scenario? Even Obama keeps that in his back pocket.GUILFOYLE: Right. It's more for the exigent circumstances. No one's talking about abusing the situation or interrogation techniques. We're talking about doing what is actually legal and lawful to be able to do. And it's going to be up to whoever the next president is and who the next director of the CIA. So this, like, hypothetical situation where Brennan's like, you know, soft like brie cheese is not too interesting to me.WATTERS: It's like, when the CIA director comes across as so soft...WILLIAMS: Yes.WATTERS: ... to our enemies, Juan, is this what you want the CIA director doing? ""Oh, you know, we're not going to touch you. We're going to be nice.""WILLIAMS: Who said that?WATTERS: Brennan.WILLIAMS: That's not what he said.WATTERS: Yes, he did.WILLIAMS: I will say this. I think that John Brennan spoke directly to a key issue, which is how we as Americans feel about the CIA and the kind of controversy and criticism that the CIA endured when the back and forth took place.WATTERS: They endured it, because your party forced them to.WILLIAMS: But let me just say, you know, your party -- your party, let me tell you, in 2015, I don't know whose party is whose party, but Republican majority is in the House and Senate passed a bill that would have banned waterboarding. It's called a torture.WATTERS: Juan, the Senate Intelligence Committee under Democratic leadership basically hung these guys out to dry. Obama was talking about prosecuting CIA agents for saving lives.WILLIAMS: That's why you don't want to put CIA agents in a position where we, as Americans, have any divide about their tactics that we know we support. And we need that agency, it should function; it should be effective. It can't be criminal.FRANCIS: You're having this conversation on this level about what's happening at the government and what everyone really means. With the general public, I think, out there hears is, on one side, you have people who are doing these barbaric things, who are chopping people's heads off and submerging them in cages.And we're afraid of words and hurting their feelings with micro aggressions in response. And that's why you see people out there saying, you know, among Trump supporters, saying they're willing to support anyone who's willing to do or say anything to get something done. They're sick of the sort of semantics that you're talking about.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think it's a semantic argument. I think most people know that, when it comes to torture, they're not...FRANCIS: I don't think we're talking about torture and waterboarding. It's not...WATTERS: James Rosen (ph), her own guy was tortured. They do that in fraternity parties.FRANCIS: Now I'm not saying waterboarding is not torture, I don't think we're having a conversation about waterboarding in particular. I think the American people are saying, ""We're worried. We're concerned. We're afraid that no one's standing up and being strong about...""GUILFOYLE: We have Predator drone strikes and blow people to pieces without -- and that's fine. But we're not going to splash some water on them, because that would be weird. It's just better to kill them?BOLLING: Another one that's under the definition of enhanced interrogation technique. Playing loud music and sleep deprivation. Now, we've decided that that was too harsh, as well.Can you imagine that cranking loud music into a terrorist jail cell and making sure that terrorist stays awake for two or three days at a time, it's so egregious that it's just not right to do?GUILFOYLE: And a caterpillar on the shoulder, really bad.BOLLING: This is the same guy who's slicing children's heads off, killing nuns, burying people in water while they're alive.WILLIAMS: Here's the point. What you're saying is very emotionally satisfying, but is it effective? Is it wrong, though? That's the question.WATTERS: Juan -- Juan, we care about victims. We don't care about the terrorists, we have to run.WILLIAMS: We care about being effective.WATTERS: Ahead, President Obama goes on the record about FOX News about Hillary Clinton's e-mail controversy. What is he now saying about the investigation and how it may or may not impact the election? That's next on ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: In a wide-ranging exclusive interview this week on ""FOX News Sunday,"" President Obama was challenged on Hillary Clinton's e-mail investigation. And he's once again defending his former secretary of state.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America's national security. What I've also said is that -- and she's acknowledged, that there's -- there's a carelessness in terms of managing e-mails that she has owned and she recognizes. But I -- but I also think it's important to keep this in perspective. This is somebody who served her country for four years as secretary of state and did an outstanding job.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Although the president doesn't think Clinton committed a crime, he says the FBI's investigation will not be influenced by him or anybody else.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: You guarantee the American people, can you direct the Justice Department to say, Hillary Clinton will be treated as the evidence goes, she will not be in any way protected?OBAMA: I can guarantee that. I do not talk to the attorney general about pending investigations, I do not talk to FBI directors about pending investigations. They -- we have a strict line and always have maintained it, I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the Justice Department for the FBI. Not just in this case, but in any case. Full stop, period.WALLACE: Even if she ends up as the Democratic...OBAMA: How many times do I have to say it, Chris? Guaranteed.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Now Kimberly, he said that she has not jeopardized national security. And yet, we have an ongoing investigation. And he says he sees no evidence of intent. But as the Wall Street Journal, in an editorial, pointed out today, intent is necessary for criminal liability, and is he sending a signal to the FBI, saying he doesn't see intent?GUILFOYLE: Has he reviewed all the files and e-mails and has he spoken to or read all the transcripts of the witnesses? No, so I don't think that it is proper or appropriate for the commander in chief to make such blanket statements like saying, in fact, she hasn't done anything wrong, in fact, she hasn't endangered national security. In fact, she did not have the requisite intent. I mean, how does he know? How does he know?WILLIAMS: He didn't say she didn't do anything wrong. He said -- what did you hear?FRANCIS: No, I mean, first of all, he stumbled over his explanation. I mean, that was kind of staggering, when he's sitting there stammering, and you never hear the president like that. He said there's a certain carelessness in terms of managing her e-mails. Actually, it isn't about intent in this case. Judge Andrew Napolitano has said over and over again you don't need intent. Carelessness right there is breaking of the law.GUILFOYLE: Negligence.FRANCIS: And then he went on to say, there's classified and then there's classified. What? No, there isn't. That's like saying you're either pregnant, but then there's really pregnant. No, you're either pregnant or you're not. It's classified or it's not. She broke the law, plain and simple. I mean, he was testifying, you know, for the prosecution there.WILLIAMS: Eric.BOLLING: There is -- there is classified. There's a high level of classified. Yes.But the problem is, what President Obama got wrong in that, is that she -- there are 22 e-mails at the highest level above classified...GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: ... of top secret, which -- which we, at least 22. Twenty-two we know of. I agree with Kimberly. She -- he doesn't think she committed a crime; guaranteed there's no political influence. How in the world do you know if, later in that same sound bite, you say, ""I didn't talk to the A.G."" But he must be talking to someone to have that theory. He must be...GUILFOYLE: Be privy.BOLLING: He lied about not talking to the A.G. Or you're making this stuff up for political reasons. One of these two has to be alive.WILLIAMS: No, no.BOLLING: He could be.WILLIAMS: Let me just say, he as the president of the United States would know if somebody...BOLLING: How?WILLIAMS: How? Because he would be told by intelligence.GUILFOYLE: But he's not supposed to be...WILLIAMS: If somebody had taken -- acted on that information. He knows that nobody apparently has done back. But Jesse, let me come to that. One of the things that's so interesting about this is Loretta lynch, the attorney general; James Comey, the FBI director, if you look at the theory from people who say, ""Well, Obama is sending signals,"" it would mean that these folks, their compromise, their integrity is in question.WATTERS: I love how he says that there's a strict line between myself and the DOJ. Kind of like the red line in Syria, Juan. We know this guy doesn't respect lines. He says he never interferes in investigations, except when he said, there's not a smidgen of corruption in the IRS, or he said, ""Trayvon could have been my son."" You remember that, Juan?WILLIAMS: They're both true.WATTERS: How about the Cambridge police acted stupidly? The guy interferes with investigations constantly.And to Kimberly's point, how do you know? He basically says she's innocent, but he hasn't been briefed. You can't have it both ways.BOLLING: Right. So it's either political, which he denied, or he's been briefed, which he denied.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. I don't think he's been briefed on the case. I think that would be -- I think if that comes out, you've got a whole new ball of wax.Ahead, what happened at the Masters yesterday? Did you see Jordan Spieth let the championship slip away? It was painful. They're calling it one of the shocking collapses of golf history. Hear what Spieth has to say about it right here, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dropping five, hitting six.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What the hell's he going to do?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why would he hit it from here?KEVIN COSTNER, ACTOR: Give me another ball.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dropping 7. Hitting his eighth shot. And now he's dropping nine. He's hitting ten.(END VIDEO CLIP)FRANCIS: Jordan Spieth had his own ""Tin Cup"" moment yesterday. The golfer was just a few holes away from another win at Augusta National. He was leading by five strokes, but he bogeyed at the tenth and 11th and had a complete implosion at hole 12.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He didn't...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The gap between the bunkers. He's not going to scare him if he goes long. Oh, my goodness. This is unbelievable. That's the 12th.(END VIDEO CLIP)FRANCIS: Bless his heart. I left the room. You're making me watch it now? Spieth did some reflecting on his sub-par performance.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JORDAN SPIETH, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: Publishing (ph) onto the drop zone where we knew the yardage, it was kind of tough for me to commit over and over by the 13th hole. So just compounded mistakes, but just the lack of discipline to hit it over that bunker, coming off of two bogeys, instead of recognizing that I'm still leading the Masters by a couple shots.(END VIDEO CLIP)FRANCIS: Listen to his voice. If losing wasn't bad enough, Spieth had to slip the green jacket on the Masters winner, Englishman Danny Willett. I mean, that jacket thing is always so awkward anyway. I don't love the precedent. It's like a bunch of guys going out to a dinner at a club and, you know, you're supposed to wear a jacket. And one of them forgot it, so they're lending him one.I don't know, I mean, what did you think? Were you teary? Were you crying for him?BOLLING: I can't tell you how -- I was really emotional.FRANCIS: I know.BOLLING: The reason why he had to put the jacket on is because he won last year. So sports is so crazy. You've got to hit a tiny ball like this with a stick, whether it's baseball or golf, it's so -- sometimes the ball will look this big to you. It doesn't matter what you do: you're going to hit it, and you're going to hit it perfect.Other times, this is what happens, and you start to choke, and you just can't get out of it. He was caught in that -- with the world looking at me, I don't know what to do. No matter what I do, he just could not hit the ball straight; he couldn't hit it solid. I feel for that guy. I've been there.FRANCIS: He's 22. He's 22. He won last year. He obviously has a huge career. But still was painful. Did you -- you don't care. You're going to say something sarcastic.WATTERS: No, I watched it.FRANCIS: Here it comes unfeeling.WATTERS: I didn't feel as bad for him when I remembered he plays golf for a living. I mean, he's got it pretty good, but it just shows you how tough that...FRANCIS: What do you do for a living, Jesse Watters?BOLLING: It's like you're hosting a show. You're solo hosting. You're standing there. It's a live show. And you're dropping words. And you're...WATTERS: Never happened to me before. So...BOLLING: Let's hope it doesn't.GUILFOYLE: You're not a choke artist?BOLLING: It's insane.WATTERS: I feel bad nor him, but you know, the guy's got it made. He's young. He's already got teenagers. He'll be fine.WILLIAMS: They thought that about Tiger Woods at one time. And look at how his head is all screwed up. I was reading about Tiger Woods in Sports Illustrated this week, and I did -- the headline said it all: ""What happened?""And so you get into the head of somebody who's 22, you know, in baseball they say if you think, you stink. So he's there. He gets to the 13th. By that point he's thinking; he's not playing. It's all in his head, and now at 22. I mean, gosh, he had a chance to go into a league with Tiger Woods.GUILFOYLE: He's going to make it. It's one match, come on.WILLIAMS: No. To win two Masters in a row. That sets you apart.GUILFOYLE: But he's 22. I'm not going to count him out.FRANCIS: No, no.GUILFOYLE: Good sports psychology, coach, it will be fine.WILLIAMS: You know what I liked about this? There was all the comparison to the crying Jordan meme online. It's like, ""Oh, he's crying."" And then the other one was he's a better loser than Cam Newton, who lost the Super Bowl, because he handled it with terrific grace.FRANCIS: He did. That's true.BOLLING: And he's the best -- he's the best in his sports. I agree with you. He'll be back.FRANCIS: Let's end on that note, very positive.All right. ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Are you ready? Are you sure?GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: K.G.GUILFOYLE: Put me in, Coach.I want to say a very special happy birthday to our friend and co-host, the super talented Mr. Juan Williams.WILLIAMS: Oh, you're so kind.GUILFOYLE: Twenty years in television, best-selling author.And...WILLIAMS: Thank you, Sean (ph).GUILFOYLE: Also, I would like to invite you all to help buy a birthday present for Juan, but just buy a book. That would make him very happy, all right? ""We, The People: The Modern-Day Figures Who Have Reshaped and Affirmed the Founding Fathers' Vision of America."" I also posted a link to it...WILLIAMS: Thank you.GUILFOYLE: ... on Amazon and Facebook. Happy birthday. Great to have you at the table.WILLIAMS: Thanks so much. That's wonderful.GUILFOYLE: Wonderful part of the...FRANCIS: That book was fantastic, by the way.WILLIAMS: Thank you, ma'am.GUILFOYLE: For good luck.WILLIAMS: All right. I'll do it just right. That -- look, I -- right in the middle.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Give it back to the Puerto Rican woman.WATTERS: Oh, my goodness.WILLIAMS: So let me just -- I'm going to do mine now. Because so yesterday, I turned 62 on Sunday, and my wife got the wait staff at Oceanaire, my favorite restaurant in D.C., to put 63 candles on one cake. And that's me trying to blow it out before it starts the fire. There's a family picture.And of course, I had my girlfriends with me. They're Pepper and Wesley with their granddad. And look at that, Kylo Ren from ""Star Wars"" showed up for the party. It was Eli, my grandson, dressed as the villain of ""Star Wars."" By the way, I'm going to do a Facebook Q&A tonight right after the show. We're going to talk politics. We're going to talk about my new book, ""We, the People."" So go to Facebook.com/TheFiveFNC. We'll be there taking your questions.BOLLING: All right.GUILFOYLE: Give me cake.BOLLING: We're going to eat cake. So watch this first. You remember last week we talked about Rick Scott. Governor Scott walked into a Starbucks and got basically derided by a liberal young lady? Well, Governor Rick Scott's pack fought back this weekend, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You may have seen this video of a terribly rude woman at a coffee shot cursing and screaming at Governor Scott? That woman clearly has a problem. And it turns out that she's a former government official who refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and calls herself an anarchist.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Yes, so it was really strange the way she went right at Governor Scott, remember at Starbucks with the 7 dollar latte and her $1,500 laptop. But he fought back. Good for him.And Jesse, you're up.GUILFOYLE: Haters gonna hate.WATTERS: Another reason not to like animals.FRANCIS: What?WATTERS: A reason why I don't touch animals. There's a guy walking around, minding his own business. Here he is: wild monkey dropkicks him to the back. Out of nowhere. The guy was doing nothing to deserve this.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.WATTERS: Guy goes down hard. I want to see that monkey in handcuffs.GUILFOYLE: Does that monkey have a whip? Or was that a...WATTERS: Boom.BOLLING: Where was this?WATTERS: This was a land far, far away, Bolling.BOLLING: You have no idea, right?WATTERS: I'm going to go with India.GUILFOYLE: You were a disaster in our segment...FRANCIS: We don't have any idea what happened before this. I mean, we don't know what he did to the monkey. For all we know, he totally deserved it. Anyway, with that...BOLLING: You're up.FRANCIS: OK. My turn. Everybody knows I have an obsession with hamburgers and hamburglars. Well, if you didn't know that, now you know. Watch this video. This is from Saturday night in the Washington, D.C. area.So this guy breaks into -- I think this is a Five Guys Burger. Look at him. So he's basically -- look, he's going to make himself a burglar. He's basically preheating the oven. What you saw before is he washed his hands, thank goodness. Because if you're a dirty burglar and you go in to make yourself a burger, you want to wash your hands. He flips the burgers.GUILFOYLE: Maybe they should hire him.FRANCIS: Yes, right, exactly.BOLLING: He wants to work.FRANCIS: At one point here -- I'm choking on my cake here -- he gets on the phone. I think he's taking more orders. I mean, you would think he's a former employee, but they sent the video out asking for help to find him. They have a full shot of his face, and they have no idea who he is. He broke in at 3 a.m. in the morning, washed his hands, made a burger.BOLLING: This could be...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Wouldn't it be amazing if, like, a McDonald's worker broke into a Burger King?FRANCIS: This is really good.WILLIAMS: This cake is excellent (ph).BOLLING: Happy birthday, Juan.Buy his books. Set your DVR so you never miss an episode of ""The Five."" That's it for us. ""Special Report"" coming up next.WILLIAMS: Thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" August 1o, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The fact is she asked me a very inappropriate question. She should really be apologizing to me, if you want to know the truth. And other candidates have said that.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: People have been tiptoeing around criticizing Mr. Trump. I think this is we should say this is not who we are as a party when it comes to women and this is not a viable approach to immigration.GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: All the air in the balloon is going to Donald Trump right now, but that's OK because this is a long process and it's like a baseball season, George. There are some early gains. It doesn't necessarily determine who is going to be in the World Series.GOV. SCOTT WALKER, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The overall media frenzy across this country is from one network to the next is focusing on one person. For a lot of us, it's like watching a car accident instead of focusing on the direction we should be headed. It's a sideshow out there.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: All that reaction to the debate and the fallout from the debate last week, what has happened over the past couple of days. We'll talk about that plus the Democratic side. Let's bring in our panel, Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post, radio talk show host Laura Ingraham who is also editor in chief of her new website LifeZette.com, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.OK, Chuck, there's obviously been a lot of response about the debate, a lot of candidates weighing in afterwards. What about the Donald Trump phenomenon and what has happened since? It seems like no matter what happens he has tapped into this vein that is essentially surging still.CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: I think I'm going to have to turn in my pundit's license because -- or somebody is going to revoke it because I really can't analyze this phenomenon. We're living through one of the strangest, most -- if not strange, one of the most puzzling moments in politics that I can remember.And part of it is a little bit artificial. Part of it is the no such thing as bad publicity, high name recognition phenomenon working to Trump's favor, but some of is real. There's sort of disquiet and upset on the political scene and it doesn't involve just the Republican Party. It stretches all the way into the Democratic Party where Bernie Sanders is drawing crowds of 28,000 people, you know, over in Seattle, and even he isn't far enough to the left for certain people who are ticking him off the rostrum.It's a very volatile political environment right now. There is apparently a market for very angry rhetoric, the kind of rhetoric Trump has been using that one would have thought would have disqualified a lot of other people from politics in the past, and it's not happening. So that's where we are.BAIER: There has been a lot of criticism not only from Donald Trump but a lot of people around the country about the way we moderated the debate. Laura, I'm sure you got feedback on your radio show.LAURA INGRAHAM, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I did. I mean, e-mails, tweets, it goes on and on.But I think, look, Trump is a symptom of what has happened, and I think you can go back to 2006, 2007 -- George W. Bush was a very popular president, 2004, reelected, 2006, we lost Congress, 2007, immigration reform. This beginning of a real a buildup of resentment and then it came into anger.After Obama is elected, Tea Party comes roaring in in 2010. Obama is reelected in 2012. The establishment then feels like we reelected Lamar Alexander and Thad Cochran, we're doing great. But underneath it all, I think there is a kind of anger on the part of a lot of white middle-class voters who feel they have been left behind. They're not bad people. They're not anti-immigrant. They don't hate all trade. But they're people who feel like a lot of the policies that we followed have not worked. And they'd like other answers and they'd like to be respected.And for now, and I don't know how long it will last, Donald Trump is the man who is channeling that upset through two issues -- globalism, trade, and immigration is the second. That's where we are right now. And everyone can say Trump is the problem, we've got to get him out of the race. We've got to push him out. But the more Republicans do that, the more they're going to see Reuters poll, Morning Consult, all these new polls that come out today that shows he's holding steady. It doesn't mean these other candidates aren't great people and they might not rise to the top. But if we don't come to terms with what's happening in the Republican Party, this is going to be a very ugly 2016.BAIER: But do you think the moderators, me included, or broadly FNC, is somehow in the tank for Jeb Bush?INGRAHAM: No. I never said that, never thought that. But, again, I think when people are as angry as they are out there, they're looking for people to throw rocks out. And if they think certain people are disinviting people from forums and they're tougher on one group than the other, I think just regular people kind of get their hackles up, even if they don't like Trump very much. A lot of them don't like Trump.So I think if there are questions maybe that are personal, I think that's fine. You've got to walk through the fire, man. They're going to get asked these questions by somebody. They better be able to answer questions that are personal and difficult.But I think, you know, we'll see if other candidates are asked some of those tough questions next time. And they better be ready to walk through the fire as well. But maybe they'll be better next time because of these tough questions.BAIER: It is interesting. I asked for stats on this. Since May, Donald Trump has been on 36 times on FOX, Jeb Bush has been on three times. And you look at all the other candidates and their appearances on FNC has been pretty balanced. Charles, your thoughts about all this?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, I think the accusations against FOX, particularly the conspiracy theories, are really out of line. Those are tough questions, and to say they were only at Donald Trump -- the first question to Dr. Carson was about a lot of the flubs he did, the contradictions, the Baltic States. They were all tough questions, most of them, especially in the first round, about contradictions or mistakes that the candidates have made.Look, in the Rosen piece I thought earlier in the show was really interesting. And he showed what actually happened in the debate. As a result of what happened after the debate, it's as if the debate itself never really happened. Think about the fact that in the afternoon debate Carly Fiorina emerged in the absence of the other hoopla as a very serious candidate everybody had discovered. The fact is if history stopped at the end of the debate and we hadn't had the stuff happening over the weekend, we would be talking about exactly what Rosen had showed, the debate over expanding Medicare that you saw among the candidates.BAIER: Let me run some of the substance from the debate, some of things that perhaps got overlooked James Rosen mentioned, some of them. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)TRUMP: -- system without the artificial lines around every state. Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people who can't take care of themselves, and I will do that through a different system.SEN. RAND PAUL, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees. We didn't create ISIS. ISIS created themselves. But we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them and by not arming them.GOV. JEB BUSH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family. But we need to control our border. And there should be a path to earned legal status for those who are here, not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.BEN CARSON, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We need a significantly changed taxation system. And the one that I've advocated is based on tithing because I think God is a pretty fair guy. You make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion. You make $10, you pay $1. And everybody gets treated the same way. And you get rid of the deductions and you get rid of all the loopholes.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: Basically, the point being, we covered a lot of topics, Chuck.LANE: Yes, and watching that debate, and even more watching it again, I sort of have the feeling there were two debates going on. Over here on one level you had several candidates, Trump foremost among them, but also Huckabee and Cruz who were addressing the people Laura is talking about at a very emotional level, at a very attitudinal level.INGRAHAM: That's what drives people crazy, let me just tell you that.LANE: Donald Trump was and is all emotion.INGRAHAM: Ted Cruz --LANE: All emotion, but in a very high level of generalities. And then over here you have a bunch of people like Jeb and like Scott Walker and Marco Rubio who are sort of talking about, you know, governance and means and ends and policies and plans and stuff. And it's amazing how little interest there is in the latter group. People really are looking for the kinds of answers that this first group is proposing. I'm sorry if the word ""emotional"" offends some people, but it remains the fact that Donald Trump, despite identifying all these issues, however real they may be, has yet to say in any serious what he will do.BAIER: Let's be honest. There would not be 24 million tuning in if Donald Trump was not on that stage, clearly. There were 6.1 million who tuned in to the early debate. That's a really high number for 5:00 in the afternoon, 2:00 on the west coast. There are people hungry for politics, but there's something happening here.INGRAHAM: There is. There is a coming crack up in the Republican Party if Republicans don't let this play out. Let it play out. If Donald Trump is as ill-equipped, if he's not a conservative, he'll fade away. Donald Trump will stumble and fade away, if that happens. That's fine. Let it happen. The people are going to figure this out for themselves.And we can talk about it. We can analyze it, this question asked this, this person disinvited that person. But in the end the country is either going in a better direction under Boehner, McConnell, Obama, and all these policies, or it's not. And I submit that there are a lot of people in this country in both parties that think these guys have had their way for a long time. Let's try some new policies.KRAUTHAMMER: But it isn't as if Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz and Kasich and all the others are the ones that people are angry about, the ones who personify Washington. You had on that stage very strong candidates. And if you were to take away the glitz and the buzz and all of the smoke, you would have seen the strongest field of candidates that the Republicans have had in 30 years.And I think one of the reasons that at the end of the debate Donald Trump decided that he would make this into a war on the moderators and the war is on FOX is because I think he thinks he lost. If you win a debate, you don't start a war attacking the moderators, and he has succeeded. He's a brilliant showman. He has succeeded in doing, taking all the attention from what actually happened in the debate.And I think the GOP will rue the day because this is a great opportunity to show off the field.BAIER: We're big boys and girls. We're fine. Not But n lot of people on my e-mail are worried about us.KRAUTHAMMER: I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about the GOP and the changing the White House a year-and-a-half from now. And it won't happen if these good candidates are completely obscured.INGRAHAM: It also won't happen if the 20 percent, let's say it is 20 percent of people in the party who ultimately like Donald Trump, it also won't work if those people feel like there's no place for them anymore. So I think we have to grow the party. But if they feel like they're the vulgarians that they're being described as I could say all of our emails are going to get a lot uglier.KRAUTHAMMER: You're saying in the absence of Trump there is nobody who can win?INGRAHAM: No. I'm not advocating Trump. I just told you he's a symptom, Charles. What I'm trying to say don't exclude those people.KRAUTHAMMER: Who is excluding those people?INGRAHAM: Don't call them emotional. They're real people with real lives.LANE: My Twitter feed has a lot of emotional tweets on them.INGRAHAM: Right. They're angry not for the sake of being angry. They are angry because feel like America is slipping away. And they'd like an America back that works for all people, including them. That's all. They're not terrible people.KRAUTHAMMER: I'm not attacking them. All I'm saying you're implying there is a certainly person that can represent them --INGRAHAM: Absolutely not. Absolutely not.KRAUTHAMMER: There isn't.INGRAHAM: I completely agree with you.KRAUTHAMMER: So we agree.INGRAHAM: Yes. Isn't that nice?BAIER: I'd like to end that panel with that.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On our buzzmeter, the campaign runs smack into the New York press corps as Donald Trump tries to bounce back in his home state after losing Wisconsin. And Ted Cruz gets a Bronx cheer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, lying Ted Cruz came today. He couldn't draw 100 people. Do you remember during the debate when he started lecturing me on New York values, like we're no good.LAURA INGRAHAM, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Ted, this obviously should have was said. And we know what you meant. But New Yorkers are taking it a different way. So, deal with it head on.DANA BASH: When you saw this, what did you make of that?SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I laughed out loud. Look, I have never been popular with left wing journalists or tabloids. And, frankly, that's not my target audience.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: And are the media now overhyping the chances of a contested convention? Hillary Clinton losing Wisconsin and now Wyoming, pushing back in New York against Brooklyn's Bernie Sanders who says she's not qualified to be president.Is the press finally doubting that she'll coast to victory? ""Saturday Night Live"" back in the headlines for taking a few whacks at the Donald.(BEGIN 'SNL' VIDEO CLIP)ACTOR PROTRAYING TRUMP SUPPORTER: I'm voting for you!(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: And the post Jon Stewart era comedy shows still hurt the candidates?Plus, my sit down with Jill Kelley smeared by the media as the other, other woman in the David Petraeus sex scandal now reveals their private e-mails how Petraeus deceived her and why it was a mistake to stay silent.I'm Howard Kurtz. And this is ""MediaBuzz.""And Ted Cruz easily beat Donald Trump in Wisconsin this week. The pundits offered a mixed verdict on whether this was a major defeat for Trump or just made it slightly harder for him to reach the magic delegate number of 1237.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: There's something about his support that is so solid that despite the loss in the face of all this, it shows a remarkable staying power.CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: Cruz victory making it almost impossible now for Donald Trump to reach the magic 1237 delegate number before the republican convention.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Trump's campaign ripped Cruz saying he's a Trojan horse for a GOP establishment is trying to steal the nomination from the billionaire and some in the media found that too harsh.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS: I think he acted like a baby. I just think, you know, it's time to be magnanimous, you lost, you lost, move on. Shut up.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The Texas senator landing on the cover of Time with a condescending headline, ""likeable enough""? And some pundits struggling to understand his appeal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: I'm a city guy. I don't get the Cruz thing. I don't get him.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Heidi Przybyla, senior political correspondent for USA Today, Gayle Trotter, a commentator who writes for The Daily Caller and The Hill, and Mara Liasson in National Public Radio, a Fox News contributor.Heidi, is there a manic depressive quality to the coverage from Cruz has totally changed the race by beating Trump in Wisconsin to Trump's going to be on a roll when he creams Cruz in New York?HEIDI PRYZBYLA, USA TODAY: Gee, the media is in such a quandary that Trump had this air of almost inevitability about him prior to Wisconsin. And then Wisconsin happened. And it completely blew up the narrative.Now I think a lot of people are confused on which way to go. The truth of the matter is if you look at the numbers, 90 percent say they're now expecting this contested convention which a lot of reporters have no clue how to kind of read those tea leaves and how the delegates are going to line up.And it's going to become very confusing process shifting from just covering state by state coverage to delegate math and the intricacies of how these different state conventions work.KURTZ: A Fox News blog this morning by the way, has Trump at 54 percent in New York, more than twice as much as Kasich and Cruz combined.Gayle, that statement I referred to on the night of the Wisconsin loss by the Trump campaign said that Cruz is breaking the law by coordinating with his super PACs. It didn't offer any evidence. Didn't impressed move Donald to quickly from that particularly controversial statement?GAYLE TROTTER, THE DAILY CALLER: I think they did but I think that the public is not really interested in this. Because we have a back and forth. You know, Cruz made the allegations that the Trump campaign planted the ""National Enquirer"" story. That had as little evidence as Trump's statement that Cruz had coordinated illegally with the super PAC. I think the public is really not interested.KURTZ: Not interested in which part? Because isn't it our job as journalists to blow the whistle when one candidate makes a charge with no since hell of evidence against another candidate?TROTTER: Certainly. I mean, the journalists need to put the facts out there. But then it's the public's role to decide if they're interested in pursuing it.KURTZ: On Sunday morning, Donald Trump on zero Sunday shows. He's been a little bit low key since losing Wisconsin. He had the big rally on Long Island and every cable news network had to awaiting Trump rally as if it's almost like they don't know what to do when he's not out there blasting away on Twitter and giving multiple interviews and feeding the media beast.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: You mean invading the media.KURTZ: Yes. They don't know what to do.LIASSON: They don't know what -- that's right. That's possible. Because Donald Trump has sucked all the oxygen out of the room and he's been a huge driver of ratings. And the whole republican primary is been the Donald Trump show.But I think what's interesting about the media not knowing or not knowing whether to call this a sure path to a contested convention that, 90 percent number is from insiders who expect a contested convention.The interesting thing about the exit polls in Wisconsin is majorities of republicans don't think there should be a contested convention. They think the nominee should the person with the most delegates, not a magic number of 1237.KURTZ: Well, we certainly know the insiders have been right about everything this whole campaign year. Come on!LIASSON: That's what's great about this. And it means that there is no media monolithic line on this because nobody knows what's going to happen.KURTZ: All right. So, let me come back to this Time cover story on Ted Cruz, ""likeable enough""? Now, does that get to the heart of the issue or is this the media elite kind of looking down its nose at Ted?PRZYBYLA: I'm sure Gayle is going to completely agree with me on this. But I think it's fair just because as someone who covered Ted Cruz in the Senate, this is the central question, not only in terms of where he is in the campaign right now but throughout his entire career.Ted Cruz completely changed the culture in the Senate from one of being about personal -- politics of party and advancing the politics of your party to personal politics. He used the filibuster -- that was his weapon of choice. And his brand was obstructionism and confrontation. He made a lot of enemies.And now the big question of where we are in this campaign right now is can he get those same people to come over now to rally behind him? You look at his supporters, even people like Lindsey Graham, the best he can say after a big victory is not congratulations, Ted, but this one will hopefully create a path for blocking Donald.TROTTER: So, we have to talk about the piece itself. It is so slanted. It's Time magazine's effort to puncture the balloon of Ted Cruz after his surprising victory in Wisconsin. It is so slanted. It has this quote in it talking about there's this painful choice that republicans have to make between Trump and Cruz.That is definitely the media elite of Washington and New York saying that republicans are not excited about these two candidates who have generated so much enthusiasm.KURTZ: Well, let me jump in, when you say -- when the article says that he's the most hated senator in Washington and quotes, you know, John McCain as having called him a whacko bird and John Boehner calling him a jack ass. That seems to be a fair political commentary. But the ""likable enough"" headline the implication there is he's just not a very likeable guy, or is he?TROTTER: Well, you know where that comes from? Barack Obama's...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Yes.TROTTER: ... back handed comment of Hillary Clinton...KURTZ: Yes. It's a point.TROTTER: ... saying that she lacked warmth and she was cold bloodedly ambitious, right?KURTZ: You're likable -- you're likable enough, Hillary but how did you -- you want to respond?PRZYBYLA: But, Gayle, I've been in so many meetings, off the record meetings with republicans and they, you know, could not believe of some of the things that Ted Cruz did on the Hill to kind of alienate not only the leaders but the rank and file.And it started with the shutdown. Pushing things that he knew had no chance of happening to stop -- shut down the government over Obamacare.TROTTER: But with the American voters with republican voters, that's what the republican voters want. And that's why Boehner is no longer Speaker of the House. That's why we have the Senate majority because the republican voters were saying they've had enough of these senators. The nation wants to where they wanted.(CROSSTALK)PRZYBYLA: But the question -- the question of where we are right now is can he get the establishment? Because these are the same people he's called the Washington cartel. These are the same people he's...(CROSSTALK)TROTTER: But it's the media's responsibility.LIASSON: What's really interesting about this of all the many pieces of conventional wisdom that have completely obliterated by the republican party, one of them is that you have to be well-liked in Washington in order to prosper in republican primary politics.No. You don't. Because Ted Cruz is not only second now but he's also cleaning up in all the shadow campaign delegate selections.KURTZ: Yes.LIASSON: But I think there have been other reporting this week including an article in the New York Times where Kellyanne Conway who is running one of Cruz's super PACs says things are changing. The establishment went from saying, oh, my God, do I want to be stabbed or poisoned? In other words, the choice between Trump and Cruz to maybe he's a regular conservative republican and I can live with that.KURTZ: Let me bring it back to New York. Because Trump, as we all expected, is throwing the New York values line that Senator Cruz used in Iowa back at him. I think the New York media all too happy to amplify that charge where he...LIASSON: Of course. Of course. This is New York. Look, you've showed the Daily News headline. Take the, you know, what train.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Oh, two subway lines, 'left and U.'LIASSON: And U. And this is New York so in your face. You can't compare. We went from Wisconsin nice to New York nasty. And, you know, Ted Cruz learned that in the Bronx a cheer is a jeer. And he went through the hazing ritual of the tabloid headline. But, yes, this is all being pumped up.But his goal still is if he can keep Trump to under 50, I think that's going to be tough...KURTZ: All right.LIASSON: ... that's what count if it's a victory.KURTZ: The truth in New York to Boston because the Boston Globe today has this mock front page put out in the opinion section. We can put it up on the screen. Deportations to begin. This imagines we're already in a Trump presidency. Mark its trade war looms. New libel law that targets, quote, absolute scam in press. Does this go too far?PRZYBYLA: Certainly. I think Trump voters and if this was intended to reach Trump voters are going to view it that way. They're going to view it as crossing a line from providing information to advocacy and they may also be, you know, offended and think that they're talking down to them with some of the specifics that were in there.But at the same time, it's an editorial and it's completely within the realm for an editorial...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Sure. Sure.PRZYBYLA: ... to raise questions about what the implications of a candidate's policy is for.KURTZ: It's an opinion section. And there's a company editorial they call Trump un-American, demagogue strong man, but this strikes me as the media not just opposing Donald Trump, not just saying he's a bad candidate, he would be a terrible president but almost screaming that he's a threat to western civilization.TROTTER: I'd say it shows that the mainstream media through this presidential election cycle has descended into fear mongering and hysteria. If you look at what they're putting out with this it simultaneously reminds me of Ted Kennedy's character assassination of Bob Bork during the Senate Supreme Court hearings.KURTZ: But those are politicians. Have you ever seen the media just do this? It's not just the left wing media, Mara, it's the National Review had the big cover against Trump. It's warning to conservative writers. The media attacks on Donald Trump which he loves to run against. They've really gone up to about DEFCON (ph) too here.LIASSON: National Review is a self-identified, you know, conservative publication.KURTZ: Yes.LIASSON: The Boston Globe which everyone knows has a liberal editorial page, I think this is not obliterating the firewall completely because they place that thing on the editorial page instead on the front page calling in parity on the opinion section.KURTZ: Yes.LIASSON: But it's knocking down the firewall. And don't forget, Massachusetts, I think to date, was Donald Trump's best state. He got 49 point something in the vote even though it's a very blue state. I think in the republican primary, he's been better those than everywhere else.(CROSSTALK)PRZYBYLA: And also the timing of those is they're going to be influential going into these other northeastern states like Connecticut.KURTZ: So, possible to where doesn't agree with the verdict that republican voters in Massachusetts...(CROSSTALK)PRZYBYLA: They clearly did not.KURTZ: Let me take care. We're running out of time. When we come back, New York's massive media mob at the center of the political universe. Which candidates can handle the tabloid times?And later, Hillary and Bernie using the media mega phone to trash each other. Is this finally a real race?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Now that the campaign has moved to the Rockies battleground of New York, Donald Trump is throwing back at Ted Cruz a certain phrase the Iowa Senator had used. Excuse me, the Texas Senator had used in Iowa.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Do you remember during the debate when he started lecturing me on New York values like we're no good. We all lived through it. We all know people that died. And I've got this guy standing over there looking at me, talking about New York values with scorn on his face, with hatred, with hatred of New York.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: And of course, with reference to 9/11, Trump visited ground zero this week. Cruz got less than a warm welcome at his first stop in the Bronx.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: This is an immigrant community, Ted Cruz.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: And the Bronx thing from this Daily News cover telling him which subway lines to Ted. You can also which ones.Joining us now is Charlie Gasporino. One time reporter for Newsday and now of course, a senior correspondent and all around loud mouth at Fox Business Network. Hey, Charlie.CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Thank you for that wonderful introduction there, Howie.KURTZ: How pumped up is the New York press corps to have a presidential primary in a state that matters and to be able to pound the candidates in their inimitable fashion?GASPARINO: Right. I mean, we should point out that it matters for a change., right? New York generally doesn't matter, particularly presidential elections. It generally always goes republican, democrat, excuse me.But now we do have a contested, a very strong contest in the republican primary. And keeping Trump under 50 percent is a key goal of Ted Cruz. I know that from talking to his people. They believe they can pick up delegates that way.And the tabloids are going to have a field day. I should point out also I write an occasional column for The New York Post so I'm kind of involved in this a little bit.KURTZ: Sure. Since you're a tabloid expert and a little bit involved in the tabloid world, are the tabloids or just the tabloid culture of New York city determined to kick Ted Cruz around?GASPARINO: You know, it's a good question. I think he makes an easy target because he's from Texas. Let's be clear here. But and Donald -- you know, if you're going to talk about a guy that's been, that's like a marine and a navy SEAL and a green beret as it goes for tabloid coverage and dealing with the tabloid media, that is Donald Trump.I mean, he survived this vicious news cycle here back in the early 1990s when we read about his multiple divorces, almost being -- I think he's insolvent at one point and he came back from that. So, this guy knows how to play well.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: He didn't just survive. Let me jump in. He didn't just survive. He thrived. He's almost a creature of the tabloid culture.GASPARINO: Right.KURTZ: He knows how to poke his finger in the eye, get fumes going. And I think all of that has been to his benefit in this presidential campaign.GASPARINO: Well, it helped his resiliency. It also is his negative. I mean, we're at the point now where people, particularly republican voters, I hear this a lot in New York State as well.You know, in the city they're saying do we really want this guy as our president? Do we really want a guy that is, you know, so tabloid driven that you'll -- that no sort of attack is below the belt. We really want this guy as the republican nominee?I think it's starting to backfire on him. And I will say this, the Daily News attack Cruz and attacked Trump early on. He called him a clown. They put a clown face on them early on. I will say this, the tabloids, I would say -- like I say, I write an occasional column for one of them, they're not as powerful as they used to be. The news is different now. We don't see people reading the tabloids on the subway anymore if you take the subway which I do a lot. It's a different culture.KURTZ: Sure. Well, I would argue that...(CROSSTALK)GASPARINO: The hours is diminished.KURTZ: Everybody's gone tabloid. But I take your point. Newspapers in general now is partly puffed. Before we go, what about Bernie? So, you have Hillary Clinton, so you obviously the former senator from New York, but she's from Illinois. Bernie is from Brooklyn and he sounds like Larry David. Does that help him?GASPARINO: Yes, I think it does. I mean, he gets coverage. Listen, I think being from New York helps when you know how to use the tabloids and what power they have right now.And I think Donald is a master at that. That doesn't mean he's going to get over 50 percent because I think at some point voters look at this and I think you see that in New York to some degree right now. They're saying, do we really want this as our president? A guys that, you know, this sometimes unhinged.KURTZ: Right. All right. Charlie, great to see you. Thanks very much.And Hillary Clinton leading in New York in that Fox News poll out this morning with a substantial double digit lead.Ahead, Jill Kelley, the woman caught up in the Petraeus sex scandal on being smeared by the media. But up next, how the presidential candidates are battling the press or boiling the press as the campaign turns red hot.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: All the candidates seem to be blaming the media or mixing it up with journalists these days. I can't remember a presidential campaign where the role of the press was so hotly contested. Ted Cruz insists the mainstream media are in the Donald's corner because as the senator once told me, he thinks virtually all journalists are partisan democrats.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: Our friends in the media tell us that Donald Trump is unstoppable in New York State.(CROWD BOOING)Oddly enough, our friends in media are very comfortable with the New York liberal who supported Andrew Cuomo and Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer for that.(CROWD BOOING)KURTZ: So, Cruz says journalists love Trump because he's liberal. A nice bank shot that hits both targets. We all know what Trump thinks of the disgusting press. And he got into it with MSNBC's Chris Jansing when she asked about his contentious interview with Wisconsin's anti-Trump radio host, Charlie Sykes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Sometime you go into unfriendly territory. That's part of the game.CHRIS JANSING, NBC NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: And that's what you considered Wisconsin to be?TRUMP: No. You said about a radio talk show host.(CROSSTALK)JANSING: You're just talking about the radio host.TRUMP: See that's what I mean about the dishonest media. I...JANSING: I'm asking you a question allowing you to answer it.TRUMP: Excuse me. You're asking me about a show host. And I said it was -- that he was unfriendly territory. Then you say is that Wisconsin?JANSING: We also talked about Wisconsin.TRUMP: No, that's so dishonest. It's so dishonest. No, no, no. Look, that's called -- you know what that's called? Dishonest media.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Well, Jansing did set a bit of a trap for him giving Trump an opening to turn it back on her. Bernie Sanders cited a Washington Post headline Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president. And justifying his attack on her as unqualified for the White House.All the headlines was bit of a stretch because Clinton didn't use those words, Sanders reverted to one of his favorite themes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (I-VT) DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me be clear. This is not the type of politics that I want to get into. I know that's what the media loves.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: So, Bernie whacked Hillary because he thought she had whacked him and then blamed it on the media's hunger for conflict. Thanks a lot. What's also striking here is how much newspapers is of matter in this campaign.Sanders took heat for his lack of detailed answers with The New York Daily News editorial. Unable to say even what laws he would use to break up the big banks. Trump got knocked for his session with the Washington Post editorial board for telling the post Bob Woodward we're heading for a massive recession and for his comments to two New York Times reporters on NATO and nuclear policy.Sometimes, not always, the press is actually doing its job. But it also happens to make a pretty fat target.Ahead, now that it's Saturday Night Live is mocking Donald Trump, is the show becoming a political factor again? But first, the media suddenly focusing on the democratic race again just as things turn nasty in New York between Hillary and Bernie.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: After Bernie Sanders clobbered Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin, the two really ratcheted up their rhetoric in media appearances with the New York primary such as when CNN's Chris Cuomo asked Hillary about comments by Bernie's campaign manager.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: Jeff Weaver said something interesting inflammatory on our air here saying that, you know, the Clinton campaign, Secretary Clinton, they need to be careful not to destroy the Democratic Party merely in pursuit of her own ambition to be president. Very strong words. Your response to that idea?HILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I mean, it's just ludicrous on the face of it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Sanders then held a news conference and hit back.SANDERS: This campaign will fight back. So, when you have headlines in The Washington Post, quote, ""Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president,"" my response is, well, you know, if you want to question my qualifications, let me suggest this. That maybe the American people might wonder about your qualifications, Madam Secretary.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: We're back with the panel. Gayle Trotter, Bernie Sanders now calling Hillary Clinton unqualified after claiming that she said the same about him. Is this why the press seems a lot more interested in this democratic race?TROTTER: I think so. I mean, it's very newsworthy. And The Washington Post later that week had a piece talking a fact check calling out Bernie Sanders for saying that Hillary had accused him of being unqualified...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Three Pinocchios.TROTTER: Three Pinocchios. And yet, Bernie is relying on the Washington Post earlier headlines going to that conclusion. So, I think that it just shows that these fact checking pieces are opinion pieces in the guise of objective reporting and the Post is loving all of this drama.LIASSON: Yes, the Post headline is misleading. Because she had merely declined to say whether she thought he was qualified or not in an interview and she was pressed three times.KURTZ: She dodged the question. Yes.LIASSON: She dodged the question.KURTZ: After so many months of, you know, this high tone, I disagree with the secretary on the banks.LIASSON: Yes.KURTZ: You can sense that isn't this what TV really wants, personal attacks?LIASSON: Of course it is. And as a matter of fact, he even said in that speech, I know the media wants us to do this.KURTZ: Yes.LIASSON: Well, you know, he also is facing a kind of do or die situation in New York even though he's won, you know, eight of the last nine. Then a lot of them have been in red state caucuses.KURTZ: Yes.LIASSON: And he needs to try to beat her in own home state. But what happened on I think MSNBC in a town hall he finally said, yes, I think she's qualified. He had backed that. Yes.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: It was kind of pushed into it. Right. Now because it's a New York primary, you had Hillary Clinton trying to get on the subway, having trouble with her metro fare card. I've seen that nine million times. I think we've got the video up.LIASSON: And he thought you used a token.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Anytime there's a token. It's been many years since Bernie lived in Brooklyn.LIASSON: Yes.KURTZ: But the pundits always come back to, well this is all been interesting. But Hillary Clinton has an interesting amount of delegate lead. If she were to lose New York or were to be close after losing eight out of nine to Bernie, would and Wyoming yesterday, would the media's story line shift to are there potentially really serious weaknesses in the Hillary candidacy.PRZYBYLA: I think we may be already be there, Howie. And the reason why is because I don't think she has to lose New York for that narrative to be relevant. Look at all of the advantages that she supposedly should have in the state having represented it.It's most importantly a closed primary where the independents who have been carrying Bernie cannot vote. So, it even comes close there, I think that people will start to, you know, people being the media will start to raise real questions and alarm bells will go off about her strength as a general election candidate.I don't think people are going to say that she's going to lose the nomination. But I think there will be real questions raised about her strength in a general.KURTZ: Well, among her media appearances this week, Hillary Clinton went on The View. Here she is with Joy Behar.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOY BEHAR, 'THE VIEW': You have Donald Trump saying things like women who have abortions should be punished. I mean, it's frightening.CLINTON: Right.BEHAR: It's frightening. What do you think will happen to women if a republican gets in -- if Trump wins, God forbid?CLINTON: He started on his very first day saying that all Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals, right? The way he treated Megyn Kelly who is a superb journalist, right?BEHAR: Right, she is. Right.CLINTON: I just don't understand what he thinks is the role of somebody running for president.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: So, Gayle, let's start with Joy Behar saying that Trump wants to punish women for having abortions. Is that his current position?TROTTER: No, it's misleading. She's misleading false information. If you go back and look at that interview at Chris Matthews, Trump wouldn't even agree that a 10 cent fine on a woman would be appropriate. He wouldn't even say that. And he...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Well, he did say in response to the hypothetical question that women should be punished and then the campaign kind of walked it back.TROTTER: He did release a statement. But if you go back I think the most newsworthy thing about that was his push back on Chris Matthews and his Catholicism and calling him out for the media angle of that.KURTZ: Heidi, what about what Hillary Clinton said about Trump's same as her comment about Mexican immigrants?PRZYBYLA: Look, there's so much that is said that is inaccurate. Like Trump never said all Mexicans. He said some are nice, implying that he thinks many of them fit into that category.KURTZ: Yes. His tone of exaggeration...PRZYBYLA: But that was an over -- that was an over, you know, obviously that was an over generalization.KURTZ: Yes. If the media just given up trying to blow the whistle and he thinks exaggerations...(CROSSTALK)PRZYBYLA: I feel like in the last cycle, Howie, I remember being part of this grand fact checking operation where we're all so wide eyed and optimistic about fact checking everything that these candidates said. And it's two things now.We're overextended. There are too many of them, you know, exaggerating things on a daily basis. But we're also little demoralized. Because frankly, when we do put these fact checks out which...(CROSSTALK)LIASSON: It's all that matter.PRZYBYLA: ... I can tell you, you know, from the heart we're trying to like do a good job of like fact checking these guys and it just doesn't seem to matter. It doesn't get the clicks and it doesn't get the attraction.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Well, some are trying.PRZYBYLA: It sounds like, excuse me, we still put them out. But like, you know, we're human beings, too. And as if it doesn't seem like people care about your product to something else.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: And if Hillary Clinton admires Megyn Kelly so much, why does she does not she give her an interview. She's done a very intelligent one appearance on Fox in this.LIASSON: And maybe she should. Maybe she should.KURTZ: OK. Here we're on board with that. As such a strange campaign. We also have Bernie Sanders, the only Jewish candidate in the race now going to a Vatican conference. There's a questions about did the pope approve this.But finally, all the stories now about the Trump campaign having big shake- ups because poll a veteran strategist is brought in to run the convention. Is that a little overdone? I mean, every campaign has internal tensions. Go ahead.LIASSON: I was going to say, the campaign shake-up is like catnip. You can't resist it. A campaign shake-up.KURTZ: Yes.LIASSON: But you know what? I think that the Manafort story has actually been covered pretty straight. Trump knew he needed a professional.KURTZ: Right.LIASSON: He hired Paul Manafort. Paul Manafort He goes on TV and says ""I speak to -- I report to the boss and we're going to get more traditional.""KURTZ: But some of the headlines that write...(CROSSTALK)TROTTER: Headlines have been like meltdowns.PRZYBYLA: Yes. I think...KURTZ: ""Game of thrones.""PRZYBYLA: Yes. We've all ""Hunger Games.""KURTZ: Yes. ""Hunger Games."" Excuse me. Sorry, ""Game of Thrones.""PRZYBYLA: We've seen campaigns go into new phases. And that's what this is. Manafort, you know, when there is a real shake-up, you're seeing people actually being...LIASSON: Fired.PRZYBYLA: ... fired or intentionally layered over.LIASSON: Yes.KURTZ: All right. No firing at this table. I hope you all come back. Mara Liasson and Gayle Trotter. Heide Przybyla, good to see you this Sunday.Ahead on ""MediaBuzz,"" the 9-year-old reporter who isn't taking any gaffe from her critics.But coming up, is SNL doing to Donald Trump what they once did to Sarah Palin and Al Gore?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: ""Saturday Night Live"" may not be the cultural force it was say a couple decades ago, but it has a long history of mocking presidential and V.P. candidates which was on display again this past week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DARRELL HAMMOND AS AL GORE: My plan, Jim, is different. Rather than squander the surplus on a risky tax cut for the wealthy, I would put it in what I call a lockbox.TINA FEY AS SARAH PALIN: I can see Russia from my house.KATE MCKINNON AS HILLARY CLINTON: Tonight I want to address that pesky media who's really crawling up and under that skin of mine. Camera two, zoom in. I have survived everything that's been thrown at me.DARRELL HAMMOND AS DONALD TRUMP: When I say women, you say suck. Women.AUDIENCE: Suck!HAMMOND: Women --AUDIENCE: Suck!(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: So, is all this just for laughs or can it be damaging?Joining us from New York is Marisa Guthrie of The Hollywood Reporter. So, does this ""SNL"" mockery of Trump portray as a kind of mean to women? Does it have any political impact?MARISA GUTHRIE, THE NATIONAL REPORTER TV EDITOR: I don't think it has any political impact. I think that Trump's base is not going to be swayed by Saturday Night Live. They're probably not even watching Saturday Night Live. But it does reflect the broader narrative that has taken hold about Trump in the last couple weeks.KURTZ: Well, so a lot of people say the show is not as relevant as it used to be even when say Tina Fey was doing Sarah Palin.GUTHRIE: Yes.KURTZ: But Trump thought the program was important enough to co-host. And I'm not saying, you know, is it going to change votes because they made fun of Donald Trump, but comedy shows can have a way of perpetuating some of a culture narrative.GUTHRIE: That's absolutely right. And I think that, you know, he was obviously Saturday Night Live having him co-host, kind of getting in bed with him at that point. They were a little light on him for many months after that.And even some of the cast members there said as much. You know, that they sort of -- certainly on that show that he hosted, they had to pull their punches a little bit. And now, obviously, you know, that was in November. The gloves are off. And you've seen, you know, him put his foot in his mouth over the last couple of weeks and they have pounced. But they've been, you know...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: So, you're saying that SNL follows the polls and of Trump dips a little bit then they can be a little more vicious?GUTHRIE: Well, yes. But also, they've given him -- Trump has given Saturday Night Live and all the other comedians, by the way, lots of ammunition with the David Duke KKK thing, with the, you know, his missteps on abortion and so, you know, they have, while they always have a lot to work with Trump, now they have a lot more.KURTZ: And speaking of other comedians, you're right. He is fodder on the late night circuit. Here is Stephen Colbert on CBS' Late Show with sort of an interview with Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, ""THE LATE SHOW"": How do you respond to Anderson Cooper comparing you to a 5-year-old?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Anderson Cooper is a dumb, dumb. He's a stupid head. A total poopy pants. It's sad.COLBERT: OK. Right now I got to say you're sounding a little immature.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know you are, but what am I?(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Well, the cartoon Donald Trump. Now look, last night on SNL, Kate McKinnon did her Hillary Clinton. But I thought that was a more gentle humor. Where now it seems to me that some of this comedy shows are kind of being a little bit more hostile to Trump. Am I wrong?GUTHRIE: I think they are being more hostile to Trump. And I think that -- but maybe they've been being hostile to Hillary all along. So, it doesn't seem like they're being suddenly hostile with Trump. You know, Saturday Night Live was certainly a little nicer.I think also, you know, the comedians appreciated Trump. But I mean, look at, you know, John Oliver's takedown of Trump from a few months ago. I mean, that was certainly not -- you know, that was certainly extremely on the nose and they also know, I think, that Trump will -- you know, a lot of stuff gets under his skin much and he's going to react to this stuff.KURTZ: I see happen, yes.GUTHRIE: And that's going to perpetuate their comedy and so they need that now.KURTZ: Well, the one good thing here is Darrell Hammond is back doing impersonations because I think he is terrific.GUTHRIE: Yes.KURTZ: Marisa Guthrie, great to see you. Thanks very much for stopping by.GUTHRIE: Nice to see you. Thanks, Howie.KURTZ: After the break, the media painted her as the other, other woman, rumored to have improper relationships with two top generals.Now Jill Kelley reveals the e-mail that landed her in the midst of the Petraeus scandal.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Jill Kelley was stalked by a mystery e-mailer who turned out to be her friend David Petraeus' jealous lover, Paula Broadwell. And when Kelly went to the FBI four years ago, the investigation led to Petraeus' resignation as CIA director for improperly sharing classified information.But leaks by investigators sparked out media frenzy that trashed Kelley's reputation over her friendship with General Petraeus and with General John Allen, a story that everybody covered.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHEPARD SMITH, FOX NEW: Investigators say she exchanged thousands of e-mails with General John Allen, the top commander of the war in Afghanistan. Those e-mails they tell us were pretty explicit according to one official who've seen them. The official called them the equivalent of phone sex over e-mail.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Kelley has a book out called ""Collateral Damage, Petraeus, Power, and Politics and the Abuse of Privacy."" And I spoke to her here in Washington.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Jill Kelley, welcome.JILL KELLEY, SOCIALITE: Thank you.KURTZ: When some news outlets suggested you were having an affair with David Petraeus when other outlets quoted ""sources"" and saying that your e- mails with General Allen were so between flirtatious and phone sex, what was it like to be in that eye of that media hurricane?KELLEY: You know, it's an experience that no person, no law-abiding citizen that goes and seeks help from our FBI for protection should ever go through. There are many women out there today that have stalkers, whether it is cyber stalkers or physical stalkers.But to then have their e-mails exploited and completely mischaracterized, actually false lies about their e-mails, it's an awful feeling to see how, number one, you're watching TV and you know that's absolutely not true.KURTZ: How did that make you feel about the press and did you feel kind of helpless to fight back?KELLEY: What I learned over time is, and it's not a very comfortable or warm fuzzy feeling, but the press was misled by this top political officials.KURTZ: The people who did the leaking?KELLEY: That's correct. This unnamed merchants.KURTZ: Right. Right.KELLEY: This smear marches.KURTZ: But at the same time, now you were kind enough to do your only interview with me print interview three years ago, and I was always asking you got to come on TV, you got to tell your story on camera.Do you regret not speaking out? Because most journalists had no way of getting your side and you weren't talking.KELLEY: Right. You know, I regret. One of the many, well, one of the two thing I regret. First one was going to the FBI for help.KURTZ: Sure.KELLEY: But the second thing I regret was not speaking sooner. You always follow your advisors and to be told don't speak, there is nothing that you did wrong, you just went and reported the crime and the attention is going to be on the stalker. And the fact that the CIA director resigned because he was compromised that's what going to make the news.So, you just stay quite. But unfortunately, these government officials that were so preoccupied in covering up their wrongdoings that caused Petraeus to resign abruptly without Congress having any knowledge about the, you know, national security that was compromised without the media knowing what was going with an FBI investigation basically about the personal life of General Petraeus.KURTZ: You also described in the book how Petraues and you were close friends with him and his wife and your husband...KELLEY: Right.KURTZ: ... asked you to go to the FBI and drop the charges because this was going to hurt him before you look at him. And you did that. And then he resigns right after the Obama's re-election and he sends you a note saying I screwed up terribly, Jill, I needed to do the honorable thing after having done to this honorable.And you write to General Petraeus, ""I know we'll never totally recover from the irreversible damage that was done by Paula Broadwell. So, I do not think it's asking too much to make one statement to help reserve what we have worked so hard our entire lives to earn such it was awfully taken away by your affair.""How disappointed did you feel that David Petraues would speak out in en questionable.KELLEY: You know, looking back now, he was in a very difficult position. A very, you know, between poor Holly, what she endured, what my family experienced, the fact that he was compromised by not only his stalker but by his losses.KURTZ: Right, but you repeatedly asked him to help you...KELLEY: Right.KURTZ: ... clear your name.KELLEY: Right.KURTZ: And he didn't want to do that?KELLEY: Right. You know, of course it's disappointing because of all the damage that these -- his political enemies did to us as collateral damage just to go to him.KURTZ: But by releasing many of your personal e-mails with Petraeus and others, aren't you doing to him what you say government leakers did to you, which is invading his privacy.KELLEY: No, not at all. Absolutely our privacy was destroyed in 2012, by the same smear and some leakers. They've destroyed it. That's never coming back.What I'm doing with these personal e-mails is to show that there was no other, other woman. That none of this was true. These are completely bogus. And the fact that our government continues to collect e-mails on millions of innocent Americans today, I'm trying to say what happened to me can happen to you.KURTZ: How did you feel when you learned about this e-mail from Sidney Blumenthal, a former Clinton White House aide and an adviser to Hillary Clinton, writing to Hillary Clinton then at the State Department, calling saying whether you co-opted the generals and admirals to make yourself the queen bee in the Tampa social circle and say you seem to be an ambitious dope.KELLEY: I personally was little taken how sexist that was. Because if I was a man, if my name was Joe Kelley, that would never, that e-mail never would have transpired. There are so many -- every leak number one was sexist, completely sexist.And no woman should ever go through that just because they reported a crime, these falsehoods that were leaked are completely bogus and defamatory and it really puts women behind. It's not fair what they did. Our country has come far along where women can have positions and make a difference and not be queen bees.KURTZ: Just briefly, ""The Collateral Damage,"" the title of your book, how lasting is it, will it ever be reversed for you and your family?KELLEY: No. The damage has been done. General Allen, he was completely humiliated and resigned, oh, I'm sorry, retired in that kind of shame after serving our country so proudly.My family, my innocent kids -- the damage that happened to our family, the pain we endured -- it was -- it's irreconcilable.KURTZ: Jill Kelley, thanks very much for joining us.KELLEY: Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: You can see more of my interview with Jill Kelley tomorrow on our home page.Still to come, the New York newspaper editor who is not sorry about helping Donald Trump with his speech. And a very young reporter scoop the competition and defies her critics.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: The New York Observer has rather close relationship with the Trump campaign, not surprising given that its owner, Jared Kushner is married to Donald's daughter, Ivanka.Now, the Manhattan Weekly is confirming that not only Kushner but the Observer's editor, Ken Kurson, helped Donald Trump with his speech before AIPAC. And so, Kurson and anyone else in the newsroom will not help the campaign in the future.The paper also changing its policy and will no longer shy away from covering Trump. Kurson is unapologetic telling the Huffington Post he basically looked at a draft of the speech, quote, ""It's a complicated world and I don't intend to let the 11 people who have appointed themselves that journalist police tell me at age 47, how to behave to whom I'm allowed to speak.""Hilde Kate Lysiak is an online reporter who beat the local press to a murder story in her hometown of (Inaudible) Pennsylvania. What makes this rather noteworthy is that, Hilde is 9.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILDE KATE LYSIAK, REPORTER: I've got a tip from my good source I'm able to confirm. Then I went straight to the scene and asked neighbors for more information. I worked very hard. Because of my work, I was able to inform the people that there is a terrible murder hours before my competition even got to the scene.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The budding journalist has gotten plenty of mean messages some calling her orange street news a complete joke and sensationalist trash. But she responded.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LYSIAK: I know that of you skeptical. And I know that some of you just want me to sit down and be quiet because I'm 9. But if you want me to stop offering news, then you get off your computer and do something about that. There. Is that cute enough for you?(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: I love this girl. And not because she is cute. Because she actually understands journalism and the need to scoop the competition. Hilde, can we hire you? I mean, in a year or two? We try to reach the younger domo.And so, for this edition of ""MediaBuzz."" I'm Howard Kurtz. We hope you like our Facebook page.
