This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: For weeks this administration has gotten hammered for the millions of insurance cancellation notices sent out to the American people. So far our tally puts it at 5.5 million people who have received notice that their policies are being canceled. And today we get word that the administration is changing the game now for next year. Instead of people signing up for year two coverage next October, learning what they can get and cannot get and how much it will cost them right before the midterm elections, open enrollment is now suddenly being pushed back a month until after the midterm elections. So people won't exactly know what they can and cannot get and how much it will cost them until after they go and vote on whether certain House members and Senate members are going to keep their jobs.Now the administration insists that politics has nothing to do with -- what? Politics, no! Critics are not exactly as sure. And this news comes just one day after Senate Democrats undid basically more than 200 years of precedent in a power grab that takes away an important check on how much power a president has.Joining us now for the first time on ""The Kelly File,"" George Will, a syndicated columnist and a FoxNews contributor. George, it's great to have you on the program.GEORGE WILL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Glad to be with you.KELLY: And so, I mean, the notion of, you know, day after day, yet another executive declaration that will change a law that was rammed through without the 60 votes need in the Senate the first time around and now we're getting rid of any 60 votes needed to block judges and now the president on yet another day declares he's changing things all by his lonesome yet again, has critics asking whether he is a president or a king. Your thoughts.WILL: Well, listen, there's a kind of lawlessness here. And it's cynical lawlessness. You know, Lily Tomlin the comedian used to portray a character she called the bag lady who said, no matter how cynical you get, you just can't keep up. And I think Americans are beginning to feel that way.This looks like a clever move. Now, it's all right in politics to be clever, but you don't want to look like you're trying to be clever because that looks tricky and sneaky. And, in fact, as the president continues to waive this and suspend that and exercise what he calls enforcement discretion, the American people are beginning to feel that the law is in constant flux. And if the law is in constant flux like by the way the rules of the Senate, there is no law just as there are no more rules in the Senate anymore.KELLY: Is it something that the people are going to fall for? Because I mean, I'm picturing this time next year, I guess, it will be right before the November elections next year. And aren't the Republicans going to come out and say, hey, guess what, when they do unveil the prices for the policies that are available to you under ObamaCare in a week, guess what they're going to be. There was a reason they pushed it back until after the midterm elections.WILL: Exactly. If people knew a month before the election, they would at least know. Now they're going to have their imagination fired by Republicans telling them to be afraid, be very afraid of what you're going to learn after the election, because they don't want you to know before the election. I don't think this is clever.But, Megyn, the ObamaCare is collapsing under the weight of accumulated cleverness. It was passed by clever parliamentary maneuvers, passed by cleverness in the cornhusker kickback and the Gatorade and the Louisiana Purchase and all the other deals. It is constructed in huge complexity because it's supposed to be a clever way of disguising the fact that this whole scheme is a large income transfer and redistribution mechanism as much as it is a health care plan. So, the cleverness compounding cleverness compounding cleverness, and it's beginning to look not a bit clever.KELLY: Can you put in perspective what we are seeing right now in this country? I mean, ObamaCare, you know, push through with no Republican support. It's never had the support of the majority of the American people. Then President Obama with his magic wand extending the year for the employer mandate and then now changing the date for, you know, enrollment, and then yesterday Harry Reid doing something he said he'd never do, that would be the darkest day of the Senate, eliminating minority rights for federal judges and beyond in the Senate which was always meant to be the place where tempers cooled and the minority rights were protected. I mean, what is going on right now?WILL: What is going on is the fulfillment of a progressive dream now 100 years old. A hundred years ago, we were in the first year of the first progressive Democratic President Woodrow Wilson. He thought, he was the first president every to criticize the American founding which he did not do at the margins, he criticized at root and branch. He said the very separation of powers is inappropriate for the modern age because America to be governed needs to have more power concentrated in Washington, more and more Washington power concentrated in the executive branch, and more and more executive branch power concentrated in executive agencies immunized from control or even supervision and oversight by Congress.The marginalization of Congress has been a constant goal of progressivism. This is why conservatism, modern conservatism, was really born in reaction to a strong executive, Frank and Roosevelt during the new deal, a strong executive of Lyndon Johnson during the great society.Conservatives had a robust and I think healthy suspicion of executive power until they had the one-fourth experience of Ronald Reagan, the president of their own.KELLY: Yes.WILL: At that point, they began to lose some of their suspicion of executive power which I hope they are now reacquiring.KELLY: Certainly may be.George Will, great to see you. Thank you, sir.WILL: Glad to be with you.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARTHA MACCALLUM, GUEST HOST: Breaking tonight. Ugly new fallout from the investigation into a terror attack that killed nearly three dozen people including several Americans as authorities reveal that one of the biggest arrests they've announced so far has now turned out to be the wrong guy.Welcome, everybody, to ""The Kelly File"" tonight, I'm Martha MacCallum in for Megyn Kelly. And ironically as the terror attack overseas continues to unfold, we also saw a major scare at both the White House and Capitol Hill today where a lone gunman raised new questions about security here at home.  We're going to have more on that later in the hour.  But we start tonight with new surveillance video from the moments before the deadly Brussels attack last week. The video shows the so-called man in white casually strolling through the airport with his apparent accomplices who would die moments later as their suicide bombs went off. His did not.  Belgium media began reporting that he had been arrested and authorities were charging him with terrorism and with murder, but now they say they did not have the right guy. He's been released and we're now back to square one in the search for that mysterious third bomber whom you see pictured there. They've asked for all the help they can get from people nearby.Mike Tobin is live in Brussels with the latest on this. Good evening, Mike.  MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Martha. And there are two key players that the investigators have identified that they do not have in custody. They don't have the second participant from the metro bombing, a sketch of him was released. He was said to have been accompanying Khalid Bakraoui, the known metro bomber who died when he sat off his own bomb. This individual was said to be accompanying him carrying that bag. That person is not in custody. And now they don't have the mysterious third bomber from the airport. The local media said they had him.Prosecutor's office only identified him as Faycal C. The investigating judge said, the evidence against him did not stand up. So, he had to release. Faycal C is now a free man although he faced the most stiff charges as anyone so far in this investigation. They let him go. The third bomber is at large. The investigators released this video today with the intention that they could drum up some new tips. The investigation is moving along at a rapid pace. There have been raids all over Belgium.  There was a raid in Rotterdam that was linked to an earlier raid in Paris.  Investigators in Italy picked up someone they say allegedly was forging documents as part of the overall effort. Investigators have picked up explosives, weapons, telephone sim cards. They've all been seized. They have eight individuals they say are key targets. All of them, Martha, are still at large.  MACCALLUM: Mike, thank you very much. So, we are also learning that Belgian authorities may have missed their chance to prevent these killers from carrying out their plans. Belgian authorities arrested one of the key players in the Paris attacks four days before the Brussels attacks. But despite what we're told was a high level of interest in him, he was questioned for about two hours and was not asked any questions about possible pending attacks. We're talking about Salah Abdeslam who you see pictured here.Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn is the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and he joins me now. Good to have you here tonight, sir. Welcome.  LT. GENERAL MICHAEL T. FLYNN (R), UNITED STATES ARMY: All right. Martha, how are you?MACCALLUM: I'm doing well.FLYNN: Thanks for having me.  MACCALLUM: Good to have you here to talk tonight. You know, you listened to Mike Tobin's report, you listened to this evidence of Abdeslam and how he was treated when he was in custody, not asked any questions at all for 24 hours despite the fact that he had bomb-making material and bombs that were set to go in his apartment. How could that be?FLYNN: Yes, Martha, one of the things I think that is coming out of this is the real need for a much stronger intelligence sharing with inside -- particularly inside of Belgium. The other though, and I will tell you because I do consider myself an expert on interrogation and debriefing of captured personnel or detained personnel, and it's going to take more than a couple hours to get the kind of information that you need out of these individuals who are suspect. So I think as we go forward, and we're going to all have to do this, I know our FBI does an extremely professional job here in this country, I know our military does an extremely professional job over in the combat zones that we've been in.But these countries in Europe are going to have to come to grips with figuring out how do they to this to be able to hold people long enough to get the kind of information that they need and to do it professionally.  What we're finding, what you're reporting, is that there was a potential that we had -- we could have had this kind of information prior but because of whatever rules and policies that they have, they may have failed to do that which is a shame.MACCALLUM: Yes. I don't understand this. You know, I mean, we're looking at the pictures of Salah Abdeslam who as we said, had bomb-making material in his apartment. They had every reason to think that he would have information about something else that would happen and then you have the Brussels attack just days later. And we know that, you know, there's a mentality of sort of a law enforcement proceeding that they're going by all the rules but when there are attacks happening all around you, why would that not ramp up sort of adrenaline in you that would want you -- would force you into finding any possible way to keep him as long as you could and question him as much as you could? What's the mentality?FLYNN: Yes. First of all, you know, I think that this is, number one, this is an extremely difficult intelligence problem, but besides being an intelligence problem, this is a leadership problem. I mean, this is a problem where the leadership that we have, and the leadership that is involved in these things, they have to recognize the severity of the type of enemy that we are facing and what lengths they are willing to go to in order to kill people and to terrorize societies and communities. So, I mean, we're going to find out more about these guys. There's going to be all sorts of raids and these things are going to happen. We're going to have others attacks, Martha, in the future.The leadership in these nations, to include the United States of America, has to come to grips with the type of enemy that we are facing and we cannot look at this as a criminal act. We have to look at this as a terrorist group that is either inspired or directed by the Islamic State based out of Raqqa, Syria, right now, and more is going to happen. So when we start to look at the problems that we're facing and the kind of things that you just described with having this guy and what they've discovered in his apartment, we're going to find out more of these things. I just hate to sit here and tell you that more to come, but more to come on this -- in these inspired attacks.  MACCALLUM: I mean, you can have a bomb-making factory, essentially, around the corner from NATO headquarters and you have no sense of urgency in questioning this man in the most compelling way possible that may have been prevented this attack --FLYNN: That's right. We don't want the sense of urgency to come after the attack. We want these people to realize that they need have to have a sense of urgency, and we don't need another Paris, another San Bernardino, or another Brussels. We have to get the sense of urgency now. Because the enemy, Martha, is acting much faster than we are right now.  MACCALLUM: All right. General Mike Flynn. Always good to talk to you, sir. Thank you very much.FLYNN: Thanks, Martha. Thank you.  MACCALLUM: Words of wisdom. All right. So, as the Brussels probe plays out, another terror attack truly horrifying as well over this Easter weekend as a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, but they have claimed allegiance to ISIS, we must point out, killed 72 people including an estimated 36 children in an Easter Sunday bombing that they say specifically targeted Christians. The officials as we said mostly women and children who were out for a family day at a beautiful park in Lahore, Pakistan, which is generally a very safe place, but today it looks like a war zone.Witnesses say the bomber detonated himself right near a swing set in the play area for young children. Horrifying photos of the victims make it clear who bore the brunt of this awful attack like this woman forced to mourn the death of her son while holding on to her young daughter. It is certainly not the first time that Christians have been the target of terror groups. On March the 4th gunmen stormed a retirement home that was run by nuns in the port city of Yemen. That killed 15 people including four nuns.  Hundreds more Christians are dead over the course of three attacks in the months prior. Fifteen hundreds over the course of 2015.Brooke Goldstein is human rights attorney and director of the Law Fair Project. Larry Korb, a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress and a former assistant defense secretary. Welcome to you both.It is a stunning world that we're living in and stories that we have to cover. And Brooke, let me start with you. The State Department hesitated initially to say that this was an attack that was aimed at Christians, despite the fact that it was Easter Sunday when this happened. Why?BROOKE GOLDSTEIN, HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Right. I mean, the initial presser release failed to state that it was, indeed, Christians that were targeted and, you know, I want to give the State Department some credit here. It only took them 24 hours to state the obvious that a Talibani suicide bomber that blew up on Easter Sunday targeted Christians intentionally, but it's symptomatic of a bigger issue. The reason why people are so angry that this initial presser didn't say radical Islam just like the Brussels presser didn't say that, it's because there is a pattern of behalf of the State Department, the Obama administration, that is a failure to identify the basic motive of theologically motivated terrorists.The reason why they kill innocent civilians, innocent children, in such a brutal fashion, is not poverty, it's not economic reasons. It's theologically motivated. And we have an administration that fails to even state the term ""Radical Islam,"" that uses counterterrorism training manuals that are devoid of the words ""Islam"" or ""Jihad"" and it frankly does not instill confidence in the American public that we know how to defeat this theologically motivated threat which is radical Islam.MACCALLUM: I mean, I want to point out this Taliban group also has pledged allegiance to ISIS. Right? So, the idea that these are disparate attacks that are happening around the world, that have no common thread in them, that is Islamic radicalism, is a farce, frankly, at this point. Larry Korb, why, explain to me any rational reason for not connecting the dots of these and treating them as if they were the fight of our generation and a form of fascism or any other fight that a generation has had to fight in the past.LARRY KORB, SENIOR FELLOW, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: Well, the State Department did condemn the attacks. They didn't say that they were directed at Christians right away because the Pakistani government said that it wasn't. In fact, a district coordinator in Lahore said, no, it wasn't against Christians. When we found out about it, then they did say it. But it was horrible. You know, they killed, as you pointed out, 36 of the dead were children. Ten were Christians. Twenty six were Muslim. And the fact that they've done this, yes, this is a big problem, but the idea that the State Department should be, you know, chastised for not saying it was against Christians.MACCALLUM: Let's give them the benefit of the doubt, Larry. Let's just give them the benefit of the doubt right now. Okay? I mean, obviously the Taliban didn't come out as Brooke was saying. But the fact is, look at the big picture -- look at the picture of Islamic radical terrorism that is, you know -- look at Iraq, look at what happened in Pakistan, look at what happened in Brussels. You know, until we have some sort of guiding principle and understand this fight and articulate what it is, how could we ever expect to win it, to get a leg up on it, to get truly a coalition behind fighting it? Larry and then Brooke.  KORB: Well, I think what has happened the Pakistani government are now going to go after them, look, they've been on both sides of this. They're so concerned with India making inroads in Afghanistan they haven't cracked down on the Taliban but I think this was Sharif, the prime minister's hometown. So, you can bet he's going to go after them now. And think this is important. We need a coalition of countries around the world to do this. We -- as General Flynn said before, we got to get the Europeans to shape up with their intelligence and their interrogation procedures and sharing intelligence. So, yes, we have to do it, but eventually this is --MACCALLUM: We have to.  KORB: -- going to be won when you persuade the people in the Muslim world that this is not their future. This is not who they are.   MACCALLUM: They know that. Believe me, they know that. More Muslims are attacked than any other religious groups, so you know, the Muslims are quite aware of it. In Jordan, they're aware of it. In Egypt, they're aware of it. In Pakistan, they're aware of it. But what's lacking is a leadership call to fight this for what it is, Brooke. And a lot of people do look at the President in Cuba and dancing the tango in Argentina -- tango in Argentina and they wonder, you know, where that is, where does that come from?GOLDSTEIN: Yes, I mean, it sends the message that we don't take this seriously when we have a president doing the wave when people are mopping up blood in Brussels. I mean, we exist in a time of Islamophobe mania.  You just have to read the State Department's clarification. We had no indication that the motivation they claim was the reason was false. We didn't have the information to confirm overtly it was, in fact, the case.  What does this mean? Just call it for what it is, radical Islam. Every time someone blows themselves up, do we have to have a segment on what is the real Islam, what is the fake Islam? That is not a counterterrorism policy.  KORB: No, they condemned it. The real question was with the talk --MACCALLUM: We condemningly heard, Larry. We've heard condemning for the last several years.  KORB: No, no, no, no --(CROSSTALK)GOLDSTEIN: They did not condemn Islamic terrorism --KORB: They condemned the attack right away.GOLDSTEIN: But they didn't say why --KORB: And they wanted to wait -- and they wanted to wait and get all the information. You know, Admiral Kirby who's a spokesman is a --GOLDSTEIN: I think we know what the Taliban's motivation is. We don't know what the motivation --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Hold on. Nobody can understand either one of you. Hold on!  KORB: They're not true. A lot of times the first reports you get from the field are not true.MACCALLUM: All right.  KORB: So, it's better to make sure you get it right because if you have to retract it, that also feeds into the narrative.GOLDSTEIN: Right.MACCALLUM: Right. You know, anybody who watched it can figure out what happened here. Larry, thank you. Condemnation is easy. Everybody condemns this. It's the next steps that we seem to have a tough time with sometimes. Larry and Brooke, thank you very much. Good to have you both with us tonight.  So even as these new details come in on the Brussels attack, and they come to light, President Obama pledging to take in more Syrian refugees than ever in 2016. Some believe that that is a move that could put American lives at risk. We will discuss that coming up next.Walid Phares, the new foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign is going to weigh in with his thoughts on that coming up. Stay with us.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You would almost say it's disgraceful, you can't even imagine that a man could make those statements especially a president of this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight in the wake of the Brussels terror attacks, President Obama standing by his controversial plan to welcome more refugees from the terror hotbed of Syria. He's vowing to up the numbers of refugees in 2016 and the President says that our openness is, he believes, a powerful example. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: As we move forward in this fight, we have to wield another weapon alongside our air strikes, our military, and our counterterrorism work and our diplomacy and that's the power of our example. Our openness to refugees fleeing ISIL's violence, our determination to win the battle against ISIL's hateful and violent propaganda, distorted view of Islam that aims to radicalize young Muslims to their cause.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Republican front-runner Donald Trump went hard after those remarks by the President. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I can't even believe that he's saying it. It's inconceivable that he's saying it. Open borders. Everything he said there is absolutely, you would almost say it's disgraceful. You can't even imagine that a man could make those statements especially a president of this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Joining me now Walid Phares, he's a Fox News terrorism and Middle East analyst, he's also a member of the team that is now advising Donald Trump on foreign policy. Walid, once again, welcome, good to speak with you today.  WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS TERRORISM ANALYST, TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER: Thank you.  MACCALLUM: So do you agree with Donald Trump there?PHARES: I do agree with Mr. Trump but the real battle is not just when these refugees are going to be coming and the President making the case that it will be openness. The real battle that Mr. Trump wants to deliver is actually 20,000 kilometer away on the other side of the globe and that is to enable those refugees before they become refugees or if they are in Turkey or Lebanon, in Jordan, to return to their homes. There is a whole area in Northeastern Syria, thanks to also our strikes against ISIS and the administration has been arguing that we're making gains.So, if we are making gain, we have a region of 10,000 square kilometers that we can equip and enable for the refugees so they're not refugees anymore to begin with. Then you have the other issue of when the refugees or some of them or asylum seekers will be coming to the United States, then yes, there's a humanitarian approach but then you have to vet. So, on both sides of the equation, I think Mr. Trump wants more clarity on the issue.  MACCALLUM: Yes. You know, I'm always -- it's strangely interesting when you look at the hundreds of thousands of people who have been needing help in Syria, right? And you look at the administration response, you go back to the red line moment and, you know, the President said, once they step over the red line with chemical weapons, then the equation would be changed. So there's so much compassion now, supposedly coming from the administration for these refugees as they cross. Why was it not there when hundreds of thousands of people, their relatives, their families, their friends, were being slaughtered in Syria? Where was his compassion then?PHARES: I don't know if the American public has the capacity or access to listen to what these refugees are saying. We speak on behalf of the refugees. We don't know their leaders. We don't know their NGOs, what they're talking about, they've been talking about. And you're right, since 2013, the red line issue, is that what are you not helping us hear? Why are you allowing ISIS and Assad to actually kick us out of Syria? So basically now that there are areas inside Syria that are free, we spoke with our NGOs, at European parliament actually ten days ago and they were representing their population and they said, all we need from the west, from Europe, and the United States is to equip us at home. Young daughters and kids wants to go home.  MACCALLUM: All right. So for those who do want to come, what's the proper vetting process? You know, because obviously people look at what happened in Europe and, yes, not all of the people who've come across as refugees in Europe are terrorists but we know that a couple of them did get through and joined these groups, perhaps the ones at work in Paris and Brussels. So, that's a problem. That's a problem that has to be dealt with effectively.  PHARES: That is a problem. It's actually the most important and strategic problem. And let's look at numbers. Once we find a solution for the refugees then the second group are asylum seekers. People who can prove that they are persecuted. I of course know what that is. We have a system here. And not only that. We have also vetters. We have NGOs that could help us. But we have to decide, are we helping 200,000 people to come or are we interviewing 200 people, 400 people to, you know, to be asylum seekers in the United States? That's a big difference.  MACCALLUM: Yes. So, very quickly, as I said to you earlier, you could pick any candidate. Why do you think that Donald Trump is the right person for this given the fact that he gets criticized for being way too vague about foreign policy?PHARES: He has been very criticized by comparing his statement as he is a candidate with those who are candidates at the same time, it's the same vagueness -- I would say it's the same, you know, abstraction. I think Mr. Trump with what he has achieved on the personal level, professional level if married and coupled with information and analysis and update and briefings by real analysts, he could deliver, in my view.  MACCALLUM: All right. So, you think they're all vague but you like his background.PHARES: I do like his professional achievement, that are strategic before he becomes president or leading the administration.MACCALLUM: Right. We will see. Walid, thank you very much. Good to speak with you tonight.  PHARES: Thank you.  MACCALLUM: So, as the new and harrowing details of the Brussels terror attack have come to light including what may now look like some frightening missteps from Belgian authorities, you just heard from Walid Phares and the Trump campaign who have a very different take from President Obama on how to fight and handle this and how to keep America safe.Joining us now with his thoughts, Republican Governor of Ohio and presidential candidate John Kasich. Governor, welcome. Good evening to you.GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you, Martha.  MACCALLUM: You know, the fact that they had this individual in custody then they let him go, they also had Abdeslam in custody and it took them 24 hours to ask him a single question. They said they were worried about him because he was tired. What does this spell to you and what would you do if you were president to make America safer than what we're seeing in Belgium?KASICH: Well, look, first of all, you know, when this happened I would have come home from Cuba, not gone to a baseball game with Castro. Number two, I would have had my military and intelligence people brief me and then I would have talked to all the heads of state in Europe and I would have sent our people over there to discuss their vulnerabilities. I think now they're beginning to move in this direction. Secondly, we need to have great human intelligence so these calls for banning Muslims from coming into the country or patrolling, you know, neighborhoods or whatever, I mean, these are people that need to be in the loop in terms of telling uses about the radicals that they see.Whether it's in the mosque or in their neighborhood. We need to take the entire world of the civilized countries and we need to come together and on top of it, Martha, we got to stop wasting our time here and not moving aggressively with our friends in the Arab/Muslim world along with Europe to destroy ISIS both in the air and on the ground. So you destroy ISIS, you begin to rebuild your intelligence, you share it worldwide, you take the fight against these radicals, these Islamists, bring the world together and here in the United States you make sure that your Joint Terrorism Task Force --MACCALLUM: I hear what you're saying.  KASICH: -- can disrupt these plots here at home.  MACCALLUM: A lot of that has been, you know, tried and some of it might work, you know, in terms of --KASICH: I don't think --MACCALLUM: It hasn't been tried except you would like it to be. I understand. In terms of NATO, Donald Trump has said that he thinks that NATO is useless in its current form and that he wants everybody to know that the wall -- you say the wall's already come down and they need to do something that's a little more instrumental. What role would NATO play in a Kasich environment?KASICH: Well, I proposed just the other day that NATO move from just a military structure into an intelligence gathering and also policing activity. That, you know, NATO is there, it works across borders. It's a perfect opportunity to use a structure like that to rebuild these things.  MACCALLUM: But they don't seem to be very enthusiastic to do that right now. Why aren't they doing that? These are their countries that are being affected and they're not doing it.  KASICH: Well, first of all, there's a big element of political correctness, bureaucracy. People stepping on each other's turf. And they don't want to do that. But that's what a leader of the United States ought to be doing. I mean, honestly, the President goes to Cuba, goes to a baseball game, he goes to Argentina, does the tango and he should have been back here leading the way and, frankly, our people should be in Europe and they should be coordinating all of this because I got to tell you, Martha, the people over there aren't going to tolerate this much longer.And frankly, they even had information from the Turks that warned them about this radicalized person and at the same time, you know, the head of Turkey, the President refuses to meet with. I don't get the whole thing, but as president of the United States, rebuild Domestic intelligence, which we have with our counterterrorism task forces, and bring the world together and tell them we're either going to hang together or we're going to hang separately. Do I think this can be accomplished? Absolutely it can be accomplished. But not by -- this is not amateur hour. This requires people who have had vast experience in National Security which I have had.MACCALLUM: All right. Let me ask you a couple questions about the presidential election before I let you go.  KASICH: Sure.  MACCALLUM: One is Wisconsin where you have changed your strategy a bit.  You're focusing on certain Congressional districts and a lot of people look at that and say that, you know, you're sort of trying to deflect the Trump effect in Wisconsin. You're looking for areas where maybe you can accumulate some delegates. Maybe it's not a bad strategy.  KASICH: Well, we think it's a good strategy. You kind of go where you think you can be successful and then we'll be rolling on to Pennsylvania where I'm in a virtual tie with Donald Trump and we think, you know, these are places, what's coming in the future, places where we think we can be highly competitive and our strategy is to accumulate delegates and head into the convention with momentum because I don't believe anybody is going to have enough delegates and we'll be there. And let me remind everybody that I'm the only one that can beat Hillary Clinton. The latest FOX poll has me up 11. All the polls show me beating Hillary Clinton by a vast amount.MACCALLUM: We're showing that poll right now.  KASICH: Pick somebody who can win.  MACCALLUM: All right. Let me ask you --KASICH: Pick somebody who can win in the fall. Yes. I'm sorry.  MACCALLUM: Let me ask you this, if Donald Trump gets to 1,237, will you back off and say this is the nominee?KASICH: He's not going to get to 1,237.  MACCALLUM: What if he does, if he does.  KASICH: Look, that's like saying what if a space man lands tonight?MACCALLUM: Not really. I mean, he's not that far away when you look at the delegate map. So, I'm just asking, we know what your scenario is if he doesn't get there. But if he does get there, does that change --KASICH: Well, Martha, he's not. No, he's not.MACCALLUM: There's no way he can get there. All right.KASICH: We're going to a convention. No, no, he's not. And look, if I had left the race, by the way, he would have won Ohio and he would have been guaranteed about getting there. We're going to be competitive in the states going forward. And he's not going to have the delegates. And you know what, of the ten times that Republicans had a convention, only three times did the leading delegate winner was able to win the convention. In other words, just because you don't have as many delegates as the leader doesn't mean you can't win. In fact, seven out of ten means you do.MACCALLUM: All right. Well, you're going to help make it a very interesting few months. And we look forward to seeing this whole thing all the way through the summer. Governor John Kasich, thank you very much.  All right. So while the political campaigns turn on many issues including the issue of terrorism, which is so much a focus right now, we're also seeing Trump and Cruz in a new fight over what we were just talking about to John Kasich about. Delegates. Could go to a lawsuit, we're told.  We'll tell you what's going on with that as we come up with Trump adviser Barry Bennett and political writer Guy Benson here on the stakes in this fight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He sends tweets attacking my wife, attacking Heidi. It is inappropriate. It is wrong. It is frankly disgusting.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight, ugly allegations flying between Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz just eight days before the next Republican primary. Wisconsin will vote on April the 5th. You've got 42 delegates at stake. The real clear politics average shows Mr. Trump and Senator Cruz neck and neck in what is becoming an increasingly gritty battle between these two.Looming large in the coverage today, a tabloid newspaper story alleging that Senator Ted Cruz has had multiple extramarital affairs. Correspondent Shannon Bream live with the latest. He has denied that. He says those allegations are garbage. Shannon, what did you find out?SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Martha, denials continue on both sides of this nasty dispute which follows the week in which the wives of the top front-runners were also dragged into the fray as well. The National Enquirer piece has no concrete allegations -- plenty of innuendo - - using the words supposedly and may have along with rumor. I asked Senator Ted Cruz directly about the story on Fox News Sunday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: He has no answers for how to keep America safe from radical Islamic terrorism so instead he attacks my wife, he attacks my family, he goes to garbage and sleaze and lies. It's categorically false and it has no business in politics. This is why people are disgusted in politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Trump has disavowed any connection to this story. His statement on the issue says in part, ""I have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this week's issue of the National Enquirer is true or not, but I had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it."" Trump went on to say the National Enquirer has been right about other scandals involving O.J. Simpson and John Edwards but added, ""I certainly hope they aren't right about Cruz.""Well, the two will meet up next on the ballot, April 5th in Wisconsin where recent polling shows Ohio Governor John Kasich in the double digits, and that means, he who has no mathematical possibility of reaching 1,237 delegates before the convention could be a spoiler for both the front- runners. But for now all the candidates are talking a lot more about the scandals than they are substance. We'll see how voters respond. Martha?MACCALLUM: Shannon, thank you very much. So, at the same time, Donald Trump is threatening a lawsuit following the results of the Louisiana Republican Primary. Mr. Trump won the primary on March the 5th in Louisiana, but now it looks likes Senator Ted Cruz may actually walk away with more delegates in that state and that has Donald Trump asking what's up with that. Barry Bennett is senior adviser to the Trump campaign and a former manager to the Ben Carson campaign. Guy Benson is Fox News contributor and co-author of ""End of Discussion."" Welcome, gentlemen, good to have you both here. Barry, let me start with you.BARRY BENNETT, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Good evening.MACCALLUM: How do you dispute the delegates? Basically ten additional ones went Cruz's way via Rubio delegates and then some unbound delegates that also want to Ted Cruz. That's the way the system works.BENNTETT: Yeah, well the problem is that 46 delegates were selected at the convention and then immediately afterwards, 27 of them gathered through the request of the state party chairman, our delegates weren't invited. And then out of those 27 by a vote of 22-5, they gave the Cruz delegates all the powerful committee slots at the convention -- 22 people out of 46 people made the decision. So, that's not (ph) one for democracy.MACCALLUM: All right. So, what we're hearing is that two Trump representatives, the Louisiana co-chairs were both at that meeting.BENETT: Yeah, and one of them has no vote and the other one did have a vote and ...MACCALLUM: But they were there. They watched the whole process play out, right?BENNETT: They walked into the meeting, yes.MACCALLUM: Okay. So, it's contrary to what you said initially, they were in attendance.BENNETT: No, no, 18 people didn't receive invitations. That's what I said.MACCALLUM: All right, but there were two Trump representatives at the meeting. But, you know, basically what Cruz is arguing is it goes to the rules. You may not like the way the game is played but these are the rules that are set by the RNC so, how do you sue if the rules exist and everybody's aware of them before the game starts?BENNETT: The reason we sue is because we want the rules followed like they're supposed to be, and that's what we asked the RNC to do. To certify these people until the rules are followed.MACCALLUM: Guy, do you think they have a case?GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it's not a lawsuit. It's a dispute with the RNC. Barry is right about that -- his candidate wrong about it. He called it a lawsuit in one of his tweets. That's sort of his reflective response to everything, either a juvenile taunt or a lawsuit. But in this particular case, what you're seeing is Ted Cruz and his campaign, yes, this is hard ball, no question about it. They are exploiting the rules to try to win.They're doing it ruthlessly. They've got a team of on the ball attorneys and I think that Donald Trump rises and wanting (ph) about it should have a campaign that is equally confident, equally prepared to fight under the rules because we're told all the time Trump has the very best people. Looks like he's being outmaneuvered, out-lawyered by Ted Cruz in Louisiana.MACCALLUM: And could be -- and it could be because we hear all the time about Ted Cruz's ground game, that he's already in advance in the states that are to come, nailing down the delegates that are accessible to him and that's the way he's working the system and it looks, you know, pretty smart.BENNET: Look, Ted Cruz's vaunted (ph) ground game has been defeated in 22 states so, I don't think it's that great. Now, you know, this was an interparty (ph) deal in Louisiana. This happened four years ago as well. Shame on us for not getting it stopped but shame on them for trying to pull it, and we'll get it stopped at the RNC.MACCALLUM: Guy, Louisiana politics do have a history.BENSON: They do. So, look, we'll see what happens. Cruz has beaten Trump in a number of states. Trump has won a lot more states, obviously than anyone else.MACCALLUM: Sure.BENSON: And the big question is will Donald Trump get to 1,237 before Cleveland? If not, it's going to be an all-bets-are-off situation.MACCALLUM: And then it goes to the second round and the legwork that's been done with these delegates could become extremely instrumental.BENSON: Very important.MACCALLUM: Wow. We're going to see how it goes. Thank you very much, Barry, good to see you tonight. Guy, good to see you as well. Thanks, guys.BENSON: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: All right, so we have new details tonight on another scene that played out. It's quite terrifying, as this got under way on Capitol Hill today especially given what happened in Brussels and in Lahore in the past week. So, you have hundreds of people racing from the scene. One officer shot. Here's what happened.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYING)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: There are new developments tonight in the Federal investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. As an exhaustive piece and the L.A. Times reported today, ""Clinton e-mail probe enters new phase as FBI interviews loom."" And then also a Washington Post piece that added a lot of new information and detail, very well researched, says a staggering 147 FBI agents are on this case right now. Some have suggested, though, that there's a higher bar when it comes to prosecuting someone who is running for president. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RON FOURNIER, NATIONAL JOURNAL COLUMNIST: I do understand that when somebody's running for president, there is a higher bar you have to get over because we can't have a system in which we're constantly charging people who are running for president with crimes.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: But our own Judge Napolitano says he believes that prosecution is quite possible in a pretty short timeframe. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDREW NAPOLITANO, JUDGE AND SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: The timing is very, very treacherous. I would think the Democrats need to know whether or not they're about to nominate somebody for president who might be a criminal defendant in a felony prosecution before November. They should know that now. Prediction, something will happen by May.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: He says something happens by May. Dana Perino is co-host of ""The Five"" and former White House press secretary under George W. Bush. She also spent some time at the Department of Justice. To this higher bar issue first that Ron Fournier brings up, what do you think about that?DANA PERINO, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think that there's no regulation or law that says that I think that what he means is that if the Department of Justice is actually going to indict the presidential candidate, that their case better be solid and lock tight. I don't think that if you're Hillary Clinton and one of your perceptions is that you consider yourself as above the law that you want it out there, that the Justice Department has to somehow clear a higher bar to indict you for doing something that let's say a marine infantryman could have done and he would have been stripped of all of his medals and have his dishonorable discharge. If you want to be commander in chief, you want everything to be equal.MACCALLUM: Yeah, and I would imagine that's the way James Comey at the Department of Justice is approaching this issue, that there is a law and if the law was broken, it doesn't matter if you're Hillary Clinton or if you are a garbage collector. I mean ...PERINO: It shouldn't matter.MACCALLUM: The same law should apply to everybody. There should not be a higher bar for someone as a presidential candidate.PERINO: That's right. The other thing that came out today is that not only that do we find out that there's -- I don't know if it's unprecedented but it seems to me 147 agents is a lot. And that they're trying to show that they put as many resources into it as they possibly can.But in addition, we found out that the FBI now will start to interview and question several of her top aides and closest friends and that gets to be very hairy and concerning and it can try to bog down a campaign. Her job is going to be very difficult to make sure it looks like everything's smooth and there are no problems here. I think that's harder to maintain as more information comes out.MACCALLUM: And they will say -- they are saying that they're glad that there's a huge concentration of agents who are on this case. They believe that once it's investigated, it's going to be over for them and that that - - the reason that there's such a big effort is to do exactly that, to put this to rest.PERINO: That's great spin and if you're -- in their camp, I don't know what else you would say because at this point, you can't question the integrity of the FBI because the FBI still holds all the cards. But just wait. If they were to do some sort of indictment, then either way, if there is an indictment, her people will cry foul and say James Comey has no integrity, et cetera. They'll try to sully the process.If she's not indicted, Martha, think about that. It just exposes the wrought and corruption that the people on the other side think already exists in the system. So the most important thing the Justice Department can do is put blinders on, say if this were Jane Doe, breaking the law or not, what would we do? And proceed from there.MACCALLUM: And there's no reason at this point to think that that's not exactly what they're doing.PERINO: I agree.MACCALLUM: And we will see when it comes out if the judge is right in a few weeks from now. Dana, thank you very much. So, my next guest agrees that this case will be wrapped up before the general election but says Hillary Clinton's use of private e-mail server resulted in no wrongdoing. Mark Hanna is a veteran of the Obama and Kerry presidential campaigns and adjunct professor of media studies at the NYU. Mark, good to have you here tonight.MARK HANNAH, DEMOCRATIC ANALYST: Hey Martha.MACCALLUM: So, 147 agents is a lot of people to have concentrated on this case if it's a big nothing.HANNAH: Sure is. A 147, that made my eyes pop and it made I think a lot of people's pop. I did talk to the campaign and they do sound like -- it's actually not just the campaign that's saying they're excited to have this thing put to bed because they're kind of tired of their candidate getting pilloried in the process (ph) and they want this thing over and done with.The feds themselves, the Department of Justice has said that they want this thing wrapped up by the general election as well. They don't want a kind of cloud hanging over -- I mean, remember, Hillary Clinton back in August said she was willing to and wanting to answer any questions these guys had for her to help them do their jobs to get to the end of it.MACCALLUM: She missed (ph) that opportunity.HANNAH: So, they're really cooperating.MACCALLUM: So Cheryl Mills and probably Houma Abedin and Jake Sullivan and the other top aides who were the people who were using this Blackberry the most. The other thing that came out of this Washington Post story that was very interesting is this issue of Mahogany Row, which is the upper offices at the State Department and they went back and traced it because they want to figure out really what's going on with the story.And that is an area where you're not allowed to bring a Blackberry in and apparently, all of these aides and Hillary Clinton were told that from day one. They said, you know what, we had Russian spy of some kind who placed a listening device inside the molding in Mahogany Row and was able to tap into it and they've been able to tap into lots of devices. They said by no means are you allowed to use a Blackberry in this area and then they, you know, found ways to get around that rule.HANNAH: Sure. Well, fortunately according to L.A. Times article, that broke the story there, according to law enforcement there have been no security breaches into this private server. There have been no foreign, you know, successful foreign attacks or hacking events so, they've been able to affirm that.But this is a problem that needs to get cleared up, it's use of private servers -- it didn't just exist in the Obama administration. This bleeds (ph) over into Dana's administration, the Bush administration. Secretary of State Collin Powell was also ...MACCALLUM: Yeah, the question here is not that, because everybody knows that they were allowed. The question is whether or not the classified information was made vulnerable at any point and not whether or not it was hacked.HANNAH: Sure, and whether it was sacrificed at the time. We know that -- we know that -- okay.MACCALLUM: I got to leave it there Mark. They're counting me down. I'm sorry. I'm out of time. We will talk again, thanks, Mark.HANNAH: Thanks Martha.MACCALLUM: All right. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight, a harrowing scene on Capitol Hill as a man tried to pass a security checkpoint with a gun and security teams went into action in a big way. James Rosen is on the Hill as it unfolded and he is live in our Washington bureau.JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Martha, good evening. Multiple sources confirm to Fox News the suspect here is Larry Russell Dawson of Tennessee, the same man arrested in October after he allegedly disrupted proceedings in the House Chamber. Capitol police say today's incident began around 2:40 Eastern Time when the suspect tried to enter the Capitol Visitor Center. Police said the suspect then drew, ""what appeared to be a weapon and so an officer fired and struck the suspect.""He was treated by medical personnel, taken to a hospital and them operated on -- his condition unknown. And police located Dawson's vehicle, a silver Dodge Ram pickup parked near the house side of the Capitol. They examined it for additional weapons, chemicals -- turned up none. For a few hours the whole complex was on lockdown with tourist and school children terrified by the gunfire. And of course, we heard from witnesses the Capitol complex is going to be re-opened tomorrow for business as usual and police say they don't believe ...(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Thanks for joining me tonight everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in tonight for Megyn. I will see you again tomorrow morning with Bill Hemmer on ""America's Newsroom"" at 9:00 eastern. Have a good night, everybody.

8	8	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2013/12/06/bill-oreilly-can-republican-party-capitalize-president-obamas-falling-popularity/	Bill O'Reilly: Can the Republican Party capitalize on President Obama's falling popularity?	"By Bill O'ReillyA recent poll by the Pew Research Center is pretty much bad news for President Obama across the board.On health care policy, 59 percent of Americans disapprove; 37 percent approve. On the economy, a whopping 65 percent disapprove; 31 percent approve. And on immigration policy, 60 percent disapprove of the President's take, just 32 percent approve. So you can see the President's standing among Americans is at its lowest point ever.The question now becomes can the Republican Party capitalize the Grand Old Party still divided between so-called moderate Republicans and committed conservatives. The brawl has been going on for years. And right now the Tea Party is right in the middle of it. According to Real Clear Politics average of possible presidential candidates in 2016 -- New Jersey Governor Chris Christie a moderate is ahead at about 19 percent; conservative Rand Paul stands at 17 percent; Senator Ted Cruz 12 percent; Florida Senator Marco Rubio 12 percent; Congressman Paul Ryan 11 percent; And Jeb Bush 10.5 percent.All of these men have a chance to run against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Mrs. Clinton is far ahead of any Democratic challenger and will remain so. With Americans disenchanted by Obamacare and a bad economy, it would seem the Republicans would have some momentum, but they don't because there is not one clear message. And even on philosophy, political philosophy, the party is deeply divided. It will take a leader like Ronald Reagan to help heal that breach.Now, if you look at the situation nationwide, it's clear the Democrats are going to campaign largely in poor and working class precincts. Today fast food workers across the country demonstrated for a $15 an hour wage. That has been endorsed by President Obama and most every other Democrat. The so-called living wage issue will be a Democratic hallmark next year.Of course, if you give fast food workers a minimum of $15 bucks an hour, fast food prices go up for everybody. So, Americans will pay more. That is a primary consideration in the debate.""Talking Points"" believes the Republican Party must drop ideology almost entirely and concentrate on the economy and putting forth a healthcare plan that makes sense. Everything else really doesn't matter. It's all about wages, jobs, and health, that's it. If the GOP does not consolidate its message, it will not capitalize on Mr. Obama's troubles. It's as simple as that.And that's ""The Memo."""	['Clinton', 'Cruz', 'Christie', 'Rubio', 'Paul', 'Obama']	['healthcare']
9	9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/09/20/ingraham-cain-explain-trump-surge-rip-obama-final-united-nations-speech/	Ingraham, Cain explain the Trump surge, rip Obama's final United Nations speech	"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" September 20, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity.""And tonight, the general election is only 49 days away, and Donald Trump, propelled by a wave of positive polls -- he's campaigning harder than ever in all the key swing states. And earlier tonight, Trump was in North Carolina. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We have to, and we don't have any choice, replace a very failed and very corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family and your country. And that's going to happen.Hillary Clinton represents insiders, she represents the donors, the politicians, the big banks, the multinational corporations and everybody getting rich off a very rigged system. And we know that.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: She represents everyone responsible for the decades-long squeezing of the middle class -- the middle class in this country has been treated so unfairly -- as jobs and wealth move to other countries.Hillary Clinton is the chief emissary for globalism. And I'm not running to be president of the world. I'm running to be president of the United States.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Hillary is all of the sudden going to get tough. The debate comes, and she'll say, I want strong borders. I believe she meant (ph) the term ""extreme vetting."" Where did you hear extreme vetting before? Only from me. Because I made up the term! I mean, I came up -- I said, We need extreme vetting to come into our country.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: All of a sudden -- all of a sudden, she's got extreme vetting and she's got all of these terms. Folks, it's not going to happen. And the reason it's not going to happen is because her special interest donors -- they like it when our businesses move out because they own businesses.  They move to Mexico. Lots of this -- really, lots of advantages for them to do that. No advantage for our country, no advantage for our jobs!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And here with reaction, the editor-in-chief of Lifezette, Fox News contributor, nationally syndicated radio host Laura Ingraham and Fox News contributor, also a nationally syndicated radio host, Herman Cain.Look at this. If you go back 18 days ago, Reuters and others were predicting a landslide for Hillary, Laura. Now, 18 days later, they show this massive surge in electoral votes for Donald Trump. It's literally 243 to 242 in the Electoral College, by their estimates and the polls that back it up.What has happened, and where does this go?LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think pragmatism and common sense is winning the day. And I think Hillary's health stumble certainly didn't help her at all. The more revelations we get about her dishonesty on the private server, the graft that was taking place at the Clinton Foundation, all leads voters to conclude, We've had enough, more of the same, we're sick of politics as usual, let's change this up, let's switch things up with a businessman who has maybe a less ideological but more pragmatic way of handling difficult problems.And I think, in the end, a lot of these voters might be swinging in that direction just because of the common sense that is involved in thinking things -- like things about refugees, Sean, when we know five million refugees displaced from the Middle East, a lot of them because of, frankly, failed policies of this administration. And we're supposed to now take in 100,000-plus people and think it's all going to work out well.I think people are very hesitant to do that, and Trump's speaking to concerns such as that. And I think that's beginning to resonate.HANNITY: You know, one of the biggest areas where we've seen a jump, Herman Cain, is among black and Hispanic voters. He's now up 7 from where Mitt Romney was with Hispanic voters. One poll actually had him at 19 percentage points for -- for black Americans voting for Trump.I'm going to be with him at a town hall, predominantly black Americans.  He's been to black churches. He's reaching out. Polls show that Hillary's black voters are switching to Trump. That was in an article in The New York Post.Obama came out harsh yesterday, says he's personally insulted by black Americans who support Trump, Trump doing better than Romney with Hispanics.  What has changed here? Is it the fact that the last eight years have not been good to the minority community?HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. In addition to what Laura said, there's one other thing that's happening. Some people are afraid to go from Hillary to Trump, so they are undecided. But the American people are not stupid. Black people are not stupid. That's why you see a surge in those numbers, and that is a good thing.People are not believing President Obama when he says, as you showed in a previous clip, that we're safer and people are more prosperous. No, we are not! They are not stupid. They're not falling for it. And as a result, that's why you see a surge in Trump's numbers not just nationally but also among blacks and Hispanics.HANNITY: Let's go to next Monday, six days from now, Laura. Hillary Clinton vows to come out swinging against Donald Trump. And OK, I don't know what that means. But she says she's not going to take any insults lying down. Why do I suspect the insults are going to be coming from her?INGRAHAM: Don't you half expect, Sean, that the Democrats are following around David Duke with a GoPro camera, hoping that he says something that's pro-Trump so they can then put it in one of their, you know, ad campaigns?  Oh, the KKK likes Trump!I mean, the whole thing is so obvious for anyone who cares to spend five minutes thinking about this. When you don't have a record to run on, when you have no record of accomplishment, when your record is checkered with dishonesty and misrepresentations and ethical problems, then what do you have? What do you have to do? You say, Well I sat down in the Situation Room and I flew around the world, and the whole world is in flames, at least in the Middle East.What does she have to say? She has to say Donald Trump is this that and the other thing. Donald Trump...HANNITY: Basket of deplorable.INGRAHAM: is a racist, all those things. That's all she has.HANNITY: Racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.INGRAHAM: So Sean, back to the debate. I was just going the say Trump has to remember the great moments for Reagan in these debates, when they tried to do similar things to Reagan. He was stupid, he wasn't smart. He has to be, like, you know, There you go again. I mean, is that all you have?  Really? That's the debate here, Hillary, I'm a bad person?HANNITY: You see, I agree with -- see -- Because Hillary is going to do this. And I don't think this is hard to figure out. I would anticipate this. She can't run on Libya. She can't run on Egypt, can't run on Iraq or Iran or Afghanistan or Putin or North Korea, China. OK. And she can't run on Obama's economic policy, which she says she's going to continue.So she can't run on honesty and trustworthiness. So what's left? Ad hominem attacks, what she said, ""basket of deplorables."" That'll come up.The key for Trump, Herman, I think, is, as she pokes and prods and aggravates and annoys and tries to piss off Trump and irritates him, she's going to try and get him -- get a reaction, get him to roll his eyes like Al Gore or get him to huff and puff. And I don't think Trump is going to fall for it. If he does, I think he'd be very foolish. He needs water off a duck's back, an impenetrable shield. Nothing she says can bother him, and he comes out a winner.CAIN: She's going to come out swinging, but the only thing that she comes out swinging with are names, name calling. And you're right. He doesn't fall for it, she's going to look very weak because he has put more substance on the table in the last several months than she has ever talked about!So yes, it's only up to name calling to try to provoke Trump such that he comes after her, and then the liberal media is going to try to turn it into a sexist attack. I don't think it's going to work because I don't think Trump is going to fall for it.HANNITY: And God forbid, Donald Trump walked over, like poor Rick Lazio...CAIN: No.HANNITY: ... and tried to hand the poor woman a piece of paper! The damsel in distress...CAIN: Not going to work.HANNITY: ... couldn't handle the stress of somebody getting in her space and her grill a little bit, which I thought was absurd.All right, you agree, Laura? I mean, is that the biggest challenge?  Beyond that, I would think that with all the speeches and interviews Trump has done, he doesn't really need a lot of prep. I think to cram his brain with facts and figures would be a bad strategy, in my opinion.INGRAHAM: Yes, the gotcha questions. You know, you know what I would say when they start pulling the gotcha questions -- Well, you know, the secretary of defense of Poland, Donald, you know who that is, right? I mean, he needs to say something like, Look, I'm sure Hillary knows all the names of all the government officials of every country on the planet because, frankly, she was probably going around, flying around on our dime asking them for donations to the Clinton Foundation.HANNITY: Yes!(LAUGHTER)INGRAHAM: Well, what I know is I know solutions, OK? She knows all the minutiae that I can learn with my top staff and all this focus we're going to have. I'm going to solve the problems for America.She can -- she can pass -- you know, pass the pop quiz, but I'm going to pass the most important test, which is leadership and competency and delivering results for the American people.So he can't get sucked in to say, I don't know. He's not going to know all the minutiae. If they try to pull the pop quiz, I think he can turn that on them really easily.HANNITY: Agree with that. All right, we'll take a break. We'll come back. More Laura Ingraham, Herman Cain right after this.And also coming up next tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: We should all understand that, ultimately, our world would be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That's Obama at the U.N. earlier today ignoring the growing Islamist threat and actually said the world is safer than ever before. And he also was talking down the U.S. He's going out the same way he came in.And later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We must deliver a just and very harsh punishment to these people!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump saying it's time for America to get a lot tougher with dealing with radical Islamic terrorists. Judge Jeanine Pirro, Jay Sekulow weigh in on that and much more tonight on this busy night here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY: All right, welcome back to ""Hannity."" And during his speech to the U.N. General Assembly earlier today, President Obama gave himself a big pat on the back and said the world is safer than ever before. Really?And that's not all. He also said that countries would be even more secure if they accommodated more refugees. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: We've taken away terrorists' safe havens, strengthened the non- proliferation regime, resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy.A quarter century after the end of the cold war, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before.We have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home.We should all understand that, ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, we continue with the editor-in-chief of Lifezette, FOX News contributor Laura Ingraham, as well as former presidential candidate, FOX News contributor Herman Cain.You know, Laura, what's interesting about this, this is front and center now because big choices on this issue. Do we want a president that will say the words ""radical Islam""? Trump will say it, Hillary won't. Do we want a president that will vet refugees from countries that have values that directly conflict with our constitutional values. Hillary wants a 550 percent increase, he wants extreme vetting. Huge difference.Also, do we want -- Hillary says we need to not build walls but bridges.  Trump wants to defend our borders. Hillary wants open borders. So big differences and distinctions here just on this one little issue.INGRAHAM: Well, it's big...HANNITY: But...INGRAHAM: It's a big issue, Sean. And we now know, of course, France is building a wall to stop the spillover of refugees that might be making their way into the U.K. That was reported. We know that only 36 percent of Americans, according to that big poll that was done in August, support allowing these refugees to enter the United States.So once again, Obama is thwarting the will of the American people in an attempt to live up to the ideals of the global community. And I think the speech at the U.N. today was really -- really bizarre. I mean, he's completely out of touch with what's happening in Western Europe with the rise of the populist movement and completely out of touch with the sentiment of the American people.I think that crosses party lines on endangering American lives by allowing people who are vetted by the U.N., when even our CIA director, Sean, a few months ago, John Brennan, said the refugee population will be used by ISIS to bring...HANNITY: Laura, it's...INGRAHAM: ... terrorists into Western Europe, and of course, then into the United States. He said that before Congress!HANNITY: By the way, not just him, our FBI director...INGRAHAM: Right.HANNITY: ... our assistant FBI director, our House Homeland Security committee chair, Mike McCaul...INGRAHAM: Yes.HANNITY: ... our former special envoy to defeat ISIS...INGRAHAM: But Obama doesn't care. He does not care!HANNITY: Sell, that's the point. And Herman, they're willing to gamble with the lives of the American people and ignore our top intelligence officials! That to me is unacceptable.Now, we can have sympathy for people that are victims of a civil war like in Syria, but what about a safe zone that Trump support, where you provide food and safety, medicine and baby formula and cots and blankets and supplies, and then they could move back into their own country eventually.  Why not that? Why is that not compassionate?CAIN: That is compassionate. The people of this country, they do care about helping those in need. Look, the comments made by President Obama simply say this. He thinks he's the president of the world, when in fact, he is the president of -- he is a failed president of the United States of America.We care about helping people, but we're not going to be suckers. You know these bridges that he talks about building, and Hillary talks about building these bridges? The problem with those bridges is that they are all coming one way, over here to hurt us, to kill us and take advantage of the generosity and the compassion...HANNITY: All right...CAIN: ... that the people in this country have!HANNITY: Let me play Obama. He came in apologizing for America, and he walks out apologizing for America. Boy, the radical, true to form, never grew in office, the same left as he was coming in, the same guy going out.  Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Yes, in America there is too much money in politics, too much entrenched partisanship, too little participation by citizens in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it hard to vote.The United States works with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalists.We've made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years. I've acknowledged some.We can only realize the promise of this institution's founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints.Surely, we can rally our nations to solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities, whether it's a religious minority in Myanmar or an ethnic minority in Burundi or a racial minority right here in the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: The only thing missing, Laura, were the terrible deeds done in the name of Christ.(LAUGHTER)INGRAHAM: Yes, well, I think Obama once again really -- really pushed the issue of, like, the Prophet Mohammed cartoon today, bringing that up. I mean, he speaks very rarely about what's happened to the Christians in the Middle East. He'll speak very generally...HANNITY: There's genocide! We're doing nothing!INGRAHAM: Yes, very...HANNITY: Genocide!INGRAHAM: Yes, the Christian population is suffering so greatly. They've been displaced from their ancestral homelands...HANNITY: We're not taking them in.INGRAHAM: We took in, like, what 52 out of 11,000? That's 99-point- something percent Muslim. So none of this -- none of this surprises me.But you're right, Sean. You hit on the important point. Despite his track record of failure, Obama took a victory lap today at the U.N., completely disassociated from reality and having learned apparently zero in eight years in office. He has learned nothing about this country, nothing about what concerns us. And apparently, his view of the world is that things are safer and more prosperous than when he came into office.HANNITY: It is pathological!INGRAHAM: Maybe for China.HANNITY: It's like a cognitive dissidence with this guy, Herman.CAIN: Yes. There's -- look, President Obama doesn't understand two things that other countries respect us for. Donald Trump understand these things, Hillary Clinton doesn't and Obama doesn't. Two things. Our economic strength and our military strength. That's what they respect.All of this feel good stuff does not matter to the rest of the world. This is where President Obama and Hillary Clinton get off track. And all Donald Trump is saying is, Let's get back on track. Let's have our economy growing as fast as it can grow, and let's rebuild our military. That's what the rest of the world will respect, and that's what rest of the world...HANNITY: All right, last question...CAIN: ... will respond to when we try to increase the strength of the community.HANNITY: Predictions. Who's going to win the election in 49 days, Herman Cain?CAIN: Donald Trump.HANNITY: Laura Ingraham?INGRAHAM: Trump, and he's going to win states that Republicans haven't won in decades.HANNITY: I hope you're both right. All right, thank you both.Coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We must deliver a just and very harsh punishment to these people!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: So after a wave of attacks here on U.S. soil, Donald Trump says we need to get a lot tougher with these terrorists. Judge Jeanine and Jay Sekulow are up next. They have reaction.And also tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The schools are failing, the jobs are leaving, and millions are trapped in poverty. So to the African-American community, I say, Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it. I will fix it.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump -- he continues his outreach to African-American voters. We'll have a preview of our big ""Hannity"" town hall tomorrow night with the GOP nominee from Cleveland, Ohio.That and more all coming up straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We have caught this evil thug who planted the bombs. Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police. He will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.(BOOS)TRUMP: His case will go through the various court systems for years, and in the end, people will forget and his punishment will not be what it once would have been. We must have speedy but fair trials, and we must deliver a just and very harsh punishment to these people!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump talking about how we need to be tough on terrorists.  Here now, the author of the brand-new book, ""Unholy Alliance: The Agenda Iran, Russia and Jihadists Share for Conquering the World,"" chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice Jay Sekulow, and ""Justice With Judge Jeanine,"" host right here on the Fox News Channel. Welcome both of you -- Judge Jeanine Pirro.Well, that's a pretty interesting, book by the way, because I think you're right. I mean, if you look at the alliance, Iran, Russia, radical jihadists, they -- two of the senses (ph), anyway, they want to advance a caliphate that's worldwide domination and Islam is the main religion, and it's convert or die. How does Putin fit into that, Jay?JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Well, here's what you've got. You've got an alliance that hasn't even existed before, and that is Russia and the Iranians are working together. You had Russia launching aircraft out of Iran into Syria, which, by the way, violates the Iranian constitution, which I have in the book ""Unholy Alliance.""There's an interesting aspect of this, Sean, and that is -- and I think Donald Trump actually got this very much correct. The Russians historically -- and you go all the way back to Benjamin Disraeli, prime minister of Great Britain in 1870, said, The Russians understand power, that you don't arbitrate, they understand power. And he said, Look, diplomacy can be power, but there has to be power behind it.And we're not projecting power. Thus the Russians, the Iranians look at our weakness and they project their strength. And they're working together, and that's where this ""Unholy Alliance"" -- including Syria involved in that, as well. There's a lot of different parts moving right now, but I think we're probably on the jihadist issue, the worst in our lifetime. I think this is worst than 9/11...HANNITY: You know, it is interesting...SEKULOW: ... as far as the level of this.HANNITY: And Judge Jeanine, this had happened with Reagan. I mean, he compared himself to Carter. Carter had shown weakness, the Iranian hostage crisis obviously the most prominent. And the world had the feeling that if Ronald Reagan won that the world was going to change dramatically and the American wouldn't be weak and timid anymore. And the world was safer as he built up our military, and the concept of peace through strength was proven to be effective.JEANINE PIRRO, ""JUSTICE"" HOST: Absolutely. And I think that's what the Americans are feeling right now, and I think that's why you're seeing the polls changing dramatically and how Donald Trump is staying strong and how he's starting to possibly turn a previously blue states red.I mean, Americans are fed up with this. They're fed up with hearing the FBI knew about someone, the FBI knew that this guy was -- stabbed someone and a grand jury didn't indict. But nothing happens. And then these people -- these wives disappear. We never hear about any of this ever again.And you know, the whole justice system, the military system -- Americans are disappointed. It is time for a change. I don't think we've ever been more...HANNITY: I honestly think that the issue of not saying ""radical Islam,"" Jay -- and there's such a different between Hillary and Donald Trump -- the issue of vetting refugees and allowing people that come from cultures that clash, directly clash with our Constitution, that Americans fundamentally understand that we have to know if they're coming here to become American and assimilate...SEKULOW: Right.HANNITY: ... or do they want to proselytize and bring their value system, which is the opposite of ours, with them. And I also think the issue of the wall -- I think it's now clear to Americans that there is a clear and present danger with radical Islamists. How many more incidents do we need to prove it?SEKULOW: Well, I mean, look, the Israelis have utilized both -- as you said earlier, they've used profiling successfully, by the way, and they have a wall. And they have a wall to protect their citizens.Now, here's the issue, Sean, that I think is front and center on this. I think you're exactly correct and I think what the judge said was also absolutely correct. And that is, if you talk to even young people, people that are just starting their families, young kids, their number one issue, the issue that they thinking about is, Can I walk down the streets of my town without worrying about a jihadist attack? Can I go through an airport not worried that, looking over my shoulder, that I've got to be prepared?  Where are the exit ways (ph)? When I into a movie theater...PIRRO: A mall.SEKULOW: These are the things people are worried about right now, and...HANNITY: Yes, a mall. Right.SEKULOW: Just think about this. Look what the last eight years of Barack Obama's leadership has done to the Middle East and to our country.HANNITY: And then all the...(CROSSTALK)SEKULOW: ... four years would be.HANNITY: You know, watching the governor of New York, you know, the mayor of New York, Comrade Bozo de Blasio -- this was an intentional act. I mean, I...(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: I've never heard that before. I've been in criminal justice for 30 years.HANNITY: What's an intentional act?PIRRO: No kidding! You think somebody would put together a pipe bomb...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: They're threading this needle and they're riding this razor's edge.(CROSSTALK)PIRRO: It's like Benghazi was due to a video. It has nothing to do in their opinion with the terrorism that is coming for us. So in order for them to protect their positions, they have to say we're defeating it. And this is just a little of this and a little of that. And I've got to tell you, Sean.HANNITY: It sounds insane.PIRRO: It is insane. It's insanity. But when we've got these guys beating their wives, you've got domestic violence, you've got them hating gays, and we are bringing them to this country. We think they're going to assimilate. They are not. And what we've got to do, they've got to move their citizenship.HANNITY: This is a clash of cultures.PIRRO: Exactly.HANNITY: We either want to be a constitutional republic or we don't. And if you're coming from a country that said if I was married to you, I could tell you how to dress, tell you whether you can go to work or school, you can't drive a car. By the way, gays and lesbians get killed, Christians and Jews get persecuted. But Hillary takes money from those countries, tens of millions.PIRRO: She doesn't believe in the Constitution. She doesn't believe in the First Amendment. Look at the U.N. resolution 16-18 where they can limit your speech about someone's religion. Obama gave his last speech at the U.N. but he started by saying no one who criticizes Islam should be allowed to be a leader of the future, whatever that line was. And what we've got are people who hate us and we let them in. We're suckers.HANNITY: You know what, I can see 9/11 like commission reporter after the next big attack, Jay, and you know what they're going to mention? They're going to mention New York and they're going to mention New Jersey and San Bernardino and Chattanooga and Fort Hood and Orlando, and they're going the say they were at war with us. We weren't at war with them again. We're making the same mistakes we made in the lead-up to 9/11/01. We have a pre- 9/11 mindset under Obama and Hillary.SEKULOW: And, Sean, we've got the paradigm is absolutely backwards. The president in his administration starts with the proposition that these are not acts of terrorism. These are intentional acts. No kidding, by the way. But they're not acts of terrorism, prove that it is. It needs to be turned around. When these incidents happen, a bomb going off in New York, assume it is terrorism and then work the facts. That's how you have to do it. But the entire paradigm has to shift. And until we acknowledge, and I say this in the book ""Unholy Alliance,"" until we acknowledge that we are at war with radical jihadists, the fact of the matter is we will lose this war. We can win it, but we've got to have the words to call it what it is.  These are radical jihadists.HANNITY: Guys good to see you both, appreciate it.Up next tonight here on ""Hannity.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The schools are failing, the jobs are leaving, and millions are trapped in poverty. So to the African-American community, I say vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it. I will fix it.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Donald Trump, he continues his outreach to African-American voters.  Up next we're going to have a preview of our town hall with the GOP nominee tomorrow night in Cleveland, Ohio. You don't want to miss that. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We're going to rebuild our country. Our infrastructure is a disaster. Our country is a mess. We're $20 trillion in debt. Think of it, $20 trillion. At the center of the effort will be in fact the rebuilding of our inner cities. Nearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45 percent of African-American children under the age of six. Think of that.The schools are failing. The jobs are leaving. And millions are trapped in poverty. So to the African-American community, I say vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it. I will fix it.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That was Donald Trump earlier today at a rally in North Carolina.  Now, tomorrow night I'll be in Cleveland, Ohio with the GOP nominee doing an hour town hall focusing on issues that impact the African-American community. We'll be doing that event tomorrow and we'll have guests at the church at the buckeye state. Joining us now is the CEO for the National Diversity Coalition for Donald Trump, the reverend Darrell Scott, and also joining us, senior adviser for African-American outreach for the Trump, Omarosa is on my show. I can't believe it.OMAROSA MANIGAULT, AFRICAN-AMERICAN OUTREACH FOR TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Hi, Hannity.HANNITY: You only have one name. Everyone knows you as Omarosa. And Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock.Since Obama has been president, there's been a 58 percent increase, black Americans on food stamps. We have 12 million more Americans on food stamp, 8 million more Americans in poverty, a 20 percent increase of black Americans out of the labor force. These are real people, real suffering, our fellow countrymen. Democrats play the race card every year. Will it work this year, pastor?REV. DARRELL SCOTT, NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP: I don't think it will. You know, Americans are not stupid, and black Americans are not stupid. We hear Hillary, we hear Donald Trump. And what Donald Trump is saying makes more sense than what Hillary Clinton is saying. She's trying to sell us on some type of fantasy of some utopian society while Trump assesses the world through a realistic viewpoint. And Trump is saying we have to deal with the world the way it is and not deal with things the way we wish they were.And so what happens is the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, they try to make it a personal choice rather than a political choice. She'll say women, don't vote for Trump because she's a misogynist and foreigners, don't vote for him because he's a xenophobe, and blacks and minorities, don't vote for him because he's a racist. But that's not working. The field is clearer now.  We don't have 19 different voices to hear. There are two candidates left.  We're able to hear what she says, we're able to hear what he says. We're able to process it, and, once again, what he says makes a whole lot more sense that than the crazy stuff she's talking about.HANNITY: Omarosa, you're going to be joining us tomorrow. I look forward to seeing you again. And what are your thoughts on all of this?MANIGAULT: I think it's important to note that the African-American community has been extremely loyal to the Democrats. But unfortunately the Democrats have not been loyal to the African-Americans. Among those statistics that you mentioned, we also saw home ownership among African-Americans drop significantly. When you look at a city like Chicago where 60 percent of the young African-American men are either unemployed or not in school, we are failing the community, and Donald Trump wants to bring change to the inner city.HANNITY: And he's reach in deep. He keeps giving speech after speech in black church after black church. He's saying I want your vote. I'll fix the educational system.MANIGAULT: He's willing to earn it. He's not going to take the African- American community for granted as the Democrats continue to do.HANNITY: And I like that he's asking for the votes, because Republicans, frankly, in the past have not done enough outreach.DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's exactly. Somebody asked me, what is the secret, why is Trump increasing his support among black voters, according to one poll up to 19.6? If that's true that's just astonishing.  I said it's very simple.HANNITY: That was the Pew poll.MURDOCK: Yes. Very simple -- he's asking for black votes. That usually doesn't happen. Usually Democrats say, well, they're going to win, so --HANNITY: What about Obama, he takes it personally as a personal insult.MURDOCK: Really an astonishing comment that somehow we owe it, we're his property and we're supposed to do as our master says or something like that. That's just appalling.And I think that Trump is doing the right thing. He's going out and asking for black votes, which is unusual, and he's doing so on very specific issues, like school choice, for example. He's very, very specific about school choice. He wants to have a block grant program to give states I believe $20 billion they can you for school choice initiatives. And you look at Hillary, and she's a tool of the teachers union.HANNITY: And coming, in the wake of the terror attack this past weekend, is it time to start surveillance like they had in New York up to 2014 in some mosques here in the U.S. looking for radical Islamists? Do you think that's smart? We'll speak with two imams, that's straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Our local police, they know who a lot of these people are. They're afraid to do anything about it because they don't want to be accused of profiling and they don't want to be accused of all sorts of thing. In Israel they profile. They've done an unbelievable job, as good as you can do.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.TRUMP: But Israel has done an unbelievable job, and they'll profile. They profile. They see somebody suspicious, they will profile, they will take that person and they'll check out, do we have a choice? Look what's going on. Do we really have a choice? We're trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That was Donald Trump yesterday reacting to recent terror attacks all across the country. Is it time for Americans start surveilling mosques here in the U.S., in other words, to find radical Islamists? Here with reaction from Nur-Allah Islamic Center, Imam Muhammad Siddeeq, and from the Islamic House of Wisdom Imam Mohammad Ali Elahi is with us, actually in studio. What are here for the U.N.?IMAM MOHAMMAD ALI ELAHI, ISLAMIC HOUSE OF WISDOM: Very good. Yes.HANNITY: What are you doing with the U.N.?ELAHI: Some meeting, some litigations, probably we can meet with President Rouhani of Iran tonight.HANNITY: You want to meet with the President Rouhani.ELAHI: Yes.HANNITY: The number one state of terror is Iran, the number one state sponsor of terror.ELAHI: That is a big lie.HANNITY: That's a lie?ELAHI: I'm not representing Iran. I'm not a spokesman of Iran.HANNITY: Let me talk to Rouhani. Tell Rouhani I want to interview him.ELAHI: They are fighting ISIS. They are fighting Al Qaeda. What about that? Real people who are on the ground and fighting terrorism --HANNITY: The Iranians have been fomenting terror, killing Americans during the Iraq war. They have been fighting proxy wars against Israel. They have also repeatedly said they're -- they've called for the destruction of Israel repeatedly, Rouhani and Ahmadinejad.ELAHI: Israelis are targeting the same thing about saying the Iranians --HANNITY: That's not true. When did Prime Minister Netanyahu call for the destruction of Iran?ELAHI: You didn't hear that?HANNITY: When has -- I have heard Ahmadinejad and Rouhani both call for -- let me finish, the destruction of Iranian. Name me one instance where Prime Minister Netanyahu every called for destruction of Iran, name one time, once. When?ELAHI: When was Rouhani asked for destruction of any country?HANNITY: They said it repeatedly. They burned American flags, they burn Israeli flags. They chant ""Death to America."" Chant ""Death to America"" in Iran.ELAHI: I'm talking about the president who is a man of wisdom, a man of peace, a man of rationality. He is meeting some --HANNITY: You tell Rouhani I want to talk to him.ELAHI: You know, he is the one who brought this resolution, the United Nations, just last time against terrorism and extremism. What about that?You know, Sean, two months ago when I called you and your office, I said 3,000 Muslim community in the United States, we are in front of the Saudi embassy demonstrating against ISIS and marching from the Saudi embassy to the White House, and I said we are saying Saudi and ISIS are the same. The only difference is the name. None of you guys came.HANNITY: I criticize Saudi Arabia.By the way, let me ask this, and then we'll get to Imam Siddeeq. Why is it that under Islam, and I don't care if it's Shia or Sunni, that they kill gays and lesbians in Iran. They kill them.ELAHI: Who said that?HANNITY: Two weeks ago, they killed a gay guy.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Women, you feel you have a right to tell women how to dress. In Saudi Arabia women can't drive. Christians and Jews, are you allowed to build a Jewish temple in Iran?ELAHI: Of course, they have their representatives in the parliament, the Jewish community. More than 40,000 Jews live in Iran, and they have a friendly relationship.HANNITY: Saudi Arabia you can't do it.Let me go to Imam Siddeeq. Imam Siddeeq, welcome back to the program. How are you, sir?IMAM MUHAMMAD SIDDEEQ, NUR-ALLAH ISLAMIC CENTER: Thank you, Sean, for honoring me to come back.HANNITY: You're very honored.HANNITY: Why is it we don't have radical Catholics and radical Jews. Why is it in the America and the world, why would we keep facing radical Islamists? Is it a direct interpretation of the Koran that says take neither Christians or Jews for your friends and talks a lot about jihad and holy war and infidels?SIDDEEQ: It's because evidently somebody is reading the stats wrong. Have you seen the stats where there's more extremists and terrorists among the Jews than among the Muslims according to the FBI --HANNITY: According to who?  SIDDEEQ: According to the FBI report from Princeton University, six percent for Muslims, seven percent for Jews.HANNITY: I have no idea to what you refer. I will say this. The greater victims of hate crimes in America are Jewish Americans, not Muslim Americans.SIDDEEQ: I'm not trying to say who did what. I'm just trying to tell you --HANNITY: Let me hear you say this. I don't hear you say radical Islamists are hijacking your religion. What won't you say that?SIDDEEQ: Because there's no such thing as radical -- you want to call the --HANNITY: They're told they get 72 virgins when they kill innocent men, women, and children.SIDDEEQ: That's not in the Koran, Sean.(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Jihadists are promised 72 virgins.ELAHI: You know, all of us, the Muslim community --SIDDEEQ: Wait a minute, who is he going to talk to, me or -- I don't want to talk over, but that's not in the Koran. There's no such thing.HANNITY: OK, but that's what they're promised. That's just a fact.SIDDEEQ: But they're not promised that. They're not promised that.You see, Sean, what we need to do, I keep trying to tell you.
