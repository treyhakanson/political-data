Warren; New calls to investigate Baltimore's top prosecutor	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" June 27, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARTHA MACCALLUM, GUEST HOST: Breaking tonight, fresh controversy for the Clinton campaign after reports raised new questions tonight about who may have been influencing Clinton during her time at the State Department.  And it appears that her team did not want the public to know about it.Welcome, everybody, to ""The Kelly File"" tonight. I'm Martha MacCallum in for Megyn Kelly. So, last week as the world's attention was on the Britain vote to leave the EU, the Associated Press released a bombshell report revealing that Mrs. Clinton had, in fact, had dozens of meetings that were either left off of her official calendar, or whose attendees were deleted.  This news was only discovered through the pursuit of a lawsuit.By comparing her official calendar to her aides' planning schedules, among those that she was meeting with, Clinton foundation donors, corporate contributors, campaign operatives, the campaign maintains, though, that nothing is awry here. Quote, ""If the different schedules refer to simply reflect a more detailed version in one version compared to another.""Meanwhile, the State Department has little to say on this matter. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: The State Department maintained and preserved extensive records of Secretary Clinton's calendars, and that's evident from the records provided by the Department to the Associated Press in this case. It's a matter of ongoing litigation, and as such, I'm not going to offer additional details.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So there's that. Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Good to see you.JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: There's not much the State Department can say about this one. I almost don't blame them for being so quiet. She is a public official, was a public official subject to the public records act, which requires that all of her, quote, ""official acts be recorded."" Official acts are one in which she engages the government to address a problem, or the government engages her. If she met with anybody in that category in those meetings with the names dropped, then she violated the official records act by deleting the names. Now, let's say she met with her hairdresser and she didn't want that name in there. Her obligation is to put it in and then go through a procedure to get it removed. Just like she did with the e-mails --MACCALLUM: That's kind of silly, isn't it? I mean, if it's a personal dinner or a friend meeting, why should she need to disclose that?NAPOLITANO: Because that's what the statute says. The statute puts the burden on the covered person, which is her as secretary of state, to make the case for why something should not be there. She enforced that statute against people who worked for her in the State Department, but she didn't enforce it against herself. In her own case, she unilaterally decided what would be removed from the records. So now we don't know -- investigators don't know if she was engaged in, quote, ""official acts or not.""MACCALLUM: So here's what her side says. That there were 75 meetings and 114 people who were deleted. They say that she had her official calendar and then her staff would give her, you know, sort of the short-run version of what she was doing that day. And one had the list of the people that were going to be there, and the other one didn't. And one example is when she rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange. They said, she ran the bell at the New York Stock Exchange. They didn't talk about who was at the breakfast prior to that.NAPOLITANO: Right.MACCALLUM: And it included, you know, corporations, CEOs, that kind of thing.NAPOLITANO: Who would trust her after all we know about her to decide with intellectual honesty that her behavior was not covered by the official acts law? Nobody would trust her. The statute doesn't trust her. The federal government says you record everything, and then if you want it kept from the Freedom of Information Act or kept from the historical records, you make the case, and others decide.MACCALLUM: She obviously knows that trust is a problem for her. Here's what she had to say about it in an appearance that she made today. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Trust is the glue that holds our democracy together. But it's no secret that Americans' trust in government as eroded. I personally know I have work to do on this front. A lot of people tell pollsters they don't trust me. Now, I don't like hearing that.(END VIDEO CLIP)NAPOLITANO: She has a federal judge, Judge Emmett Sullivan, who was appointed by her husband, who doesn't trust her to tell him the truth. She certified under penalty of perjury that she delivered all of her e-mails to the State Department. This afternoon, 165 e-mails between her and her aides in the State Department were released that she never delivered to this judge.MACCALLUM: Yes. And in one of them, she talks very specifically about, I'm not really sure how my information is being saved between the State Department and here, and we need to make sure that we know how that's working.NAPOLITANO: And in another one, Huma Abedin talks about you've been hacked. We've got to shut down the Clinton server for a while. That defies her statements that she never was hacked.MACCALLUM: The VIP had to sue to get the information on her personal calendar and compare it to those records, and there is a reason why they wanted that information, and it lays out here. Thank you very much, Judge.NAPOLITANO: You're welcome.MACCALLUM: Good to see you.NAPOLITANO: Good to see you, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, for her part, Hillary Clinton spent the day with the woman that may end up being her vice presidential candidate, a woman who Donald Trump is tonight accusing of being a fraud and a racist. Those are his words. Today for the first time, liberal Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren joining Hillary Clinton on the campaign stage. Look at this picture here today, folks. With the Senator wasting no time going squarely after Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS.: When Donald Trump says he'll make America great, he means make it even greater for rich guys just like Donald Trump.(CHEERS)And watch out because he will crush you into the dirt to get whatever he wants. That's who he is.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Wow. A short time later, Mr. Trump responded calling out Senator Warren over her unproven claims that she's part Native American, Cherokee to be exact. Here's what he told the reporter. Quote, she said that she's five percent Native American. She was unable to prove it.  Elizabeth Warren is a total fraud, he says. She made up her heritage, which I think is racist, says Donald Trump.Joining me in moments, Governor Mike Huckabee, who is a former presidential candidate of course and a FOX News contributor. And Mark Hannah, a former campaign aide to President Obama.But first, let's go to Trace Gallagher, who has the back story on this whole thing. Hi, Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. After years of identifying as white, in 1984, Elizabeth Warren contributed recipes to a Native American cookbook called powwow chow, claiming she was Cherokee.  Then from 1985 to 1995, Warren identified as a Native American in the Association of American Law School's desk book. That's a directory of law professors.If fact, when Warren was a Harvard Law professor, the university was criticized for not having enough diversity on the faculty. So, the school defended itself by touting Warren's lineage. The Senator strongly rejects any accusation that she benefited by identifying a minority, but she has also struggled to explain why she did it in the first place saying, things like it's always been part of her family story. And remember this? Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WARREN: I still have a picture on my mantle at home, and it's a picture my mother had before that, a picture of my grandfather. And my Aunt Bea has walked by that picture at least a thousand times, remarked that he -- that her father, my Pawpaw, had high cheekbones like all of the Indians do.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: She went on to say that we grow up on what our families tell us. Experts point out that it would be nearly impossible to prove that she doesn't have some Native American blood in her family and some have said at most, she could be 132nd Cherokee. But after some fairly exhaustive research, the New England historical genealogical society says it has found no proof of her self-proclaimed Native American lineage, and that her family is not listed in 20th Century census of major tribes. We should note that Warren stopped identifying as a Native American in the directory of law professors in 1995, right after she accepted a tenured position at Harvard -- Martha.MACCALLUM: That's interesting. Thank you, Trace.Mark Hannah joins us now, former campaign aide for President Obama's presidential campaign and the author of the new book ""The Best Worst President: What The Right Gets wrong about Barack Obama."" That is just out. Mark, good to see you this evening. Thanks for being here.MARK HANNAH, AUTHOR, ""THE BEST WORST PRESIDENT"": Thank you for having me.MACCALLUM: It's a little weird. I mean when you go back and listen to the whole back story, we've all heard the back and forth between, you know, the Pocahontas from the Trump side and her claims that she is part Cherokee.  But it's weird that she identified not that way for such a long time, and then she identified as Cherokee. And then after a while, she dropped it.HANNAH: Well, I think there's been an enormous amount of media scrutiny when she ran for Senate in 2012, you had right wing radio hosts in my home state of Massachusetts sort of lambasting her on this. Obviously the voters of Massachusetts didn't care because they elected her to Senate.  And I don't think if this is -- the card Donald Trump wants to play is going after Elizabeth Warren, who basically doesn't have any real relevance to this campaign for this. I don't think it's a winning strategy.I think Donald Trump got knocked off his game a little bit. He's supposed to be making substantive attacks on Hillary Clinton. But by calling her racist for even acknowledging that she might have some Cherokee heritage is like calling somebody sexist, a man sexist because he has -- it's the same logic as calling a man sexist because he acknowledges he has a mother, because he has a grandmother.MACCALLUM: I mean, I think -- and I'm far from speaking for him. But I think if I understand correctly what he's saying, he's saying if she's not Cherokee, then to go through all this and talk about the high cheekbones in the family and all of that is, you know, is disingenuous.HANNAH: People can defend Donald Trump's comment that Elizabeth Warren is somehow racist, but this is coming from a man, remember, who the Republican speaker of the house just days ago referred to and basically scolded for his racist comments. So it looks like Donald Trump is bringing all the maturity and strategic sophistication of and, I know you are, so what am I kind of approach to political campaigning. It's just -- it doesn't -- it reached --MACCALLUM: I mean she's calling him a thin-skinned money grubber. I mean she goes after him the same exact way.HANNAH: Sure. Sure. But they make substantive attacks at the same time.  But Donald Trump seems unequipped to make substantive attacks. Margaret Thatcher, the conservative prime minister of Great Britain once said, you know, I cheer up immensely when people make personal attacks at me because it shows me that they have no political argument left. Donald Trump is a master of political attacks. He's called this president the worst president ever. But it shows that he basically is vacuous, is empty handed when it comes to actual substantive criticism. And if he wants to win 51 percent of the voters in 2016, he needs to come up with substantive criticism.MACCALLUM: Mark, I got a half a minute left. Give me the headline of your book, and it comes out tomorrow, right?HANNAH: Sure. Yes. A lot of your viewers see me on this, you know, kind of liberal spouting in defense of the Obama administration. If you're wondering how anybody in their right mind could still think this president is a fantastic president, buy this book. It basically, you know, for any open-minded conservative watching, for Liberals that might have a conservative uncle or neighbor they want to, you know, have a ready response for when they're talking about Benghazi or the Syria debacle, but you don't, you know, you follow the news but you don't have all the information, this is a fun, light-hearted take, a good way to bring family together and -- on the 4th of July weekend, right? Over the cookout.MACCALLUM: The best worst president. Mark, good to see you. Thank you very much for being here tonight.HANNAH: Thank you, Martha. Thanks for having me.MACCALLUM: Best of luck with your new book.HANNAH: I appreciate it.MACCALLUM: So, here now to respond, Governor Mike Huckabee. He's a former presidential candidate of course. And he is a FOX News contributor.  Governor, good to see you again today. Welcome.MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you, Martha.MACCALLUM: So you heard all the back and forth there.HUCKABEE: You know, I'm wondering if Mark's book, is it in the fiction category? I'm just wondering because from what he said, I think I'll look for it under fiction.MACCALLUM: Well, I guess your response is duly noted, but he hopes that many people don't agree with you. But tell me something here. When you hear this back and forth, she calls him a thin-skinned money grubber, and he calls her Pocahontas, and it does raise a valid question, which is does any of this name-calling beget anything that is worthwhile to voters on either side?HUCKABEE: I think everybody understands that if you're going to call Donald Trump something, he's going to come back at you. And I think Elizabeth Warren has opened herself wide open for this. Look, she called Donald Trump a racist, called him a money grubber, all sorts of things, very personal attacks. And then for her to pretend that she's so righteous, so holy, she would never do something like that. I just think it's absurd.But, look, the scene today was just classic. You had Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren, who is always talking about how horrible it is for these Wall Street people, and she's standing there with the poster child of Wall Street political funding, Hillary Clinton. The one thing they do share is a very left-wing philosophy. I've said that this was the beginning of left and lefter. Hillary and Elizabeth Warren on the same stage, pure left.MACCALLUM: So, I mean, how did these two come together? I mean, you know, certainly what you say about the background between them and the things that she's called Hillary Clinton, it's absolutely true. So what do you see here in the making politically? Is this the V.P. candidate? Is this what we've got in terms of a pairing in November?HUCKABEE: Well, it would be a fascinating ticket because I'd love to see how Elizabeth Warren goes out there and defends Hillary Clinton's being a wholly owned subsidiary of Wall Street. I'd love to see how she's going to talk about Hillary Clinton getting all this cash from foreign governments who jail people who are gay and who put them to death, and somehow that Hillary is the champion for diversity and women's rights. I mean this is absurd. But it's part of this narrative that Democrats can just ignore the realities and speak about how pure they are, how devoted they are. A lot of Americans have been hurt by their policies.MACCALLUM: But if you have a candidate who has trouble with women voters, which Donald Trump does when you look at the polls, and you've got two women, one who is going to bring in the Bernie Sanders vote, and the other who is going to bring in the stability and continuation of the Obama White House, that could be a pretty formidable team.HUCKABEE: I don't know. I mean I'm not sure how stable the Obama administration is. You've got ObamaCare that's made it very difficult for a lot of families to afford health insurance. Double the national debt to nearly $20 trillion. Our place in the world has been decimated. Nobody respects us anywhere in the world anymore. You know, you got Putin flying fighter jets over navy destroyers and taking hostages by the Iranians. I'm not sure Hillary wants to latch onto that and say, give me four years, and I'll just keep that great stuff going because I think people looking objectively can't hardly embrace that as terrific.MACCALLUM: See her separating when she feels it's worthwhile from the administration and embracing them when they thinks it serves her well.  Governor Huckabee, thank you very much. We'll see you soon, sir.HUCKABEE: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: So when the Supreme Court today ruled against new safety standards for abortion clinics, some on the left were elated. In fact, one late-night show talk show host suggested going out and celebrating by, quote, ""knocking someone up in Texas."" Seriously. Trevor Noah said that.Ben Shapiro, and Eboni Williams up next on that.Plus, bombshell new revelations have some lawyers asking if the Baltimore D.A. intentionally misled the grand jury that charged six police officers in Freddie Gray's death. This is a ""Kelly File"" exclusive that you must hear in this case. Straight ahead when we come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARILYN MOSBY, BALTIMORE CITY STATE'S ATTORNEY: To the youth of this city, I will seek justice on your behalf. This is a moment. This is your moment.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Developing tonight, new fallout after the Supreme Court issued one of the court's most sweeping decisions on abortion rights in more than a decade. Today, the court determined that Texas had gone too far with new rules that state described as safety standards for abortion clinics.Shannon Bream reports live tonight from Washington.SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Justice Kennedy was once again the key vote in a critical case. This time siding with the liberal wing of the court to strike down portions of a Texas law the authors say was meant to safeguard the health of women seeking abortions. Critics said that was just a sham and that the real motivation was to shut down the majority of clinics in Texas. They argued that women in that state would be left with few options, likely being forced to drive hundreds of miles to get to a doctor or clinic who could comply with the standards.In striking down the regulations, Justice Breyer expressed real doubt that they would actually benefit women's health. With Justice Ginsberg writing in a concurring opinion that it is, quote, ""beyond rational belief that the law would genuinely protect women undergoing an abortion."" The dissenters, Justices Thomas and Alito said the court bent over backwards to get to that end result. Thomas writing that the court actually reworked the rules, benefiting, quote, ""judicially created rights like abortion while disfavoring many of the rights actually outlined in the constitution.""  Both sides say the battle is not over.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today is just day one. We've got an election where these issues are on referendum. We've got an election where the future of women's rights, which are human rights, are at stake.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This generation is pro-life. The tide has turned in our country. Our culture is changing. We just have to transform Washington now.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Both sides also used today's ruling as a prime example of why the Supreme Court should be on the mind of every voter heading to the polls this fall -- Martha.MACCALLUM: All right. Thanks to Shannon Bream.So, almost as soon as this ruling came down, we started to hear cheers of sorts from the left. Trevor Noah, of the daily show, went on Twitter to encourage people to, quote, ""Celebrate the Scotus ruling. Go knock someone up in Texas."" I kid you not. And then there was the former Texas State Senator Wendy Davis, who got national attention for crusading against this law. Here she is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WENDY DAVIS, FORMER TEXAS STATE SENATOR: Well, I'm overjoyed. I have to tell you I was fighting back tears a moment ago as I was reading the Scotus blog, and the first line that came out saying that the Fifth Circuit opinion or decision had been reversed. It's incredible news for the women of Texas. It's incredible news for the women throughout this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Interesting. So joining me now, Ben Shapiro is an attorney and editor-in-chief at DailyWire.com. And Eboni Williams is an attorney and a Fox News contributor. Welcome to both of you.EBONI WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: I want to get your thoughts on the ruling. But your thoughts first culturally on the reaction that this got from some on the left. Ben, what do you think?BEN SHAPIRO, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILYWIRE.COM: Well, I mean I think number one, Trevor Noah is slightly below bubonic plague on the funny scale. So, it's not really a shock that he'd come out with a tweet like that. But this shouldn't be a surprise. I think Trevor Noah kind of let loose what a lot of Democrats actually think, which is that there's no reason abortion should be safe, legal and rare. The internal logic of that statement, the old Clinton formulation doesn't hold. If abortion is about aborting something that isn't fully human, then why should it be rare?And if it is about aborting something that is human, then why exactly should it be legal? So, the full scale celebration you see, the idea that abortion is actually birth control, that's what most Democrats including the Democratic Party platform, which it was revealed today calls for a destruction of literally all state and federal laws that restrict, quote, ""access to an abortion as well as public funding for abortion both at home and abroad."" They don't believe abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.  They think that it's just a form of birth control.MACCALLUM: Eboni, what do you think?WILLIAMS: Well, look, I thought the tweet from Trevor Noah was ignorant, sad, and very distracting from what I thought was a very classical constitutional analysis delivered by the court today. And I thought that was sad. I've got to respectfully disagree with Ben on the fact that most Democrats see abortions as a primary method of birth control or method at all of birth control. I'm just simply not aware of the data that shows that. I know for, you know, people that I know personally that are pro- choice, they are just that. They're pro the women's right to choose.  Actually not pro-abortion even and certainly not advocating that be some method of birth control. That's why we have other actual birth control options.MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, there were other pro-choice individuals who said that they were horrified by some of these expressions like the one that Trevor Noah put out. You're shaking your head, Ben? You don't believe that?WILLIAMS: Yes. Why? It was disgusting.(CROSSTALK)I thought it was a disgusting claim because it was a celebration and it kind of, to me, underscored the point you made, Ben. And I think it's a sad and disgusting point that anyone in this country would view abortion as a method of birth control.SHAPIRO: But why would you object to that? If you don't think that the child is fully human, then why would you care?WILLIAMS: Nobody said that. I think that you're connecting dots that I've certainly not stated. So to be pro-choice -- actually you know what, Senator Marco Rubio, I thought really brilliantly laid out this analysis in one of the debates where he talked about this issue of whether or not the child is unborn and does the child have rights and also does the mother have rights, and where do those rights intersect or overlap? And I'm someone that believes that certainly the child -- unborn child has rights.  I believe that the mother has rights. I simply happen to a person in some belief that those mothers' rights deem to usurp those rights.SHAPIRO: In what world would any of my rights allow me to kill another human being?WILLIAMS: Well, Ben, again you're not a woman. And as a woman, I'm someone that is simply saying --SHAPIRO: So what?WILLIAMS: -- it is my position that a woman has a right to dictate the choices to ground her whole body, that is not to ignore or takeaway the rights of any unborn child.SHAPIRO: And I'm not a slave holder. That doesn't mean --WILLIAMS: Thank goodness you're not a slave holder, Ben. That's good news. I'm really glad --SHAPIRO: No, the point that I'm making, and if you'd let me finish the sentence, the point I'm making is that the greatest moral problem in society historically is the idea that you get to arbitrarily define what is human and what is not based on your own convenience.WILLIAMS: Again, this is not a discussion about humanness, but thank you.MACCALLUM: Eboni, thank you very much.WILLIAMS: Thank you so much, Martha. Ben Shapiro, thanks to you as well.  A very big decision and controversial indeed coming out of Texas today.  And more to come on that.MACCALLUM: So there are serious new questions tonight about the conduct of the Baltimore D.A. as the lead investigator in Freddie Gray's death says that she was forced to mislead the grand jury that indicted those six officers. We know how this has gone so far. Should the other three be relieved of the rest of this process given what has happened?Plus, Donald Trump attacking a new national poll as dirty and underhanded, and he's not the only one who is raising questions about that survey.Chris Stirewalt and Larry Sabato coming up next on that. Stand by. We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: We are back and breaking tonight, two national polls touching off a hot new debate. One survey is from ""The Wall Street Journal"" the other one came from ABC and they show presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton comfortably ahead of Donald Trump. They have also touched off questions, though, about who is in these polls and how accurate the responses are.Joining us on that is Chris Stirewalt, Fox News digital politics editor and Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Gentlemen, welcome. Good to see you both this evening. Larry, let me start with you. You say it's June. Wake up, it's just June, right?LARRY SABATO, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS DIRECTOR: Yeah, it's just June, absolutely.MACCALLUM: Busting out all over.SABATO: While polls matter at any particular time, you want to look to them, but you want to look to the polling averages, Martha. You never want to focus on individual polls, and actually in a way, we were lucky to have these two very different polls come out simultaneously because obviously they can't both be right. Maybe they're both wrong, but you know at least one is wrong.MACCALLUM: Chris, when you take a look at this and you look at the work that Donald Trump clearly has to do, I mean, you know, if these -- if you split it down the middle, I mean you can't really find a poll -- maybe there's one I saw out there today where he was ahead.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: No. No. But the professor is quite right. Do you like Slim Jims? The way you get a delicious Slim Jim, bursting with flavor, is you take a bunch of different meats, various meats.MACCALLUM: This is really gross.STIREWALT: You put them through a process and you have a new product at the end. That's the polling average.MACCALLUM: But nobody wants to see how the Slim Jim is made Chris.STIREWALT: You don't look inside. Don't look inside. I'm telling you don't look inside. So, when we look at the polling average, Hillary Clinton is seven points ahead of Donald Trump. That's how it stands. And that's probably right. But there's a difference between polls being properly conducted and accurate and being predictive, and to the professor's point, we don't know what it's going to look like in November.The problem for Donald Trump right now is this is the season in which voter attitudes set up. I use the analogy of concrete. The concrete is setting up. Voters are getting their second look at Trump. It's not setting up great. He needs to change the contour of the race.MACCALLUM: But he says it's a dirty poll, Chris.STIREWALT: Oh, well.MACCALLUM: Washington Post he says, oh, they hate me. It's a dirty poll even though that he was ahead in that poll, and he kind of liked it back then.STIREWALT: You ever heard of winning politician complain about the polls? Not once ever in history. So, this is some stuff that you say -- politicians have to -- you can't just say, yeah, we're losing, and we're going to fix it. What Trump is saying is the polls are wrong, but also acknowledging quietly we're really going to launch it big after the convention and we're really going to come in that (ph).MACCALLUM: Yes, this is so interesting. They keep saying we haven't really started yet. They've been going for months, since last summer, over a year now. And, Larry, they say they haven't started yet. One of the interesting things post-Brexit is that there's this idea of the shy Tory vote, right? And that's what -- you know, people don't want to admit that they wanted to exit the E.U., but when they went in there and pushed that lever, they sure as heck did. And they say there's a shy Trump vote out there as well. What do you think?SABATO: Yes. Well, first, I want to tell Chris that I like his metaphor about Slim Jim so much, I plan to steal it and this is...MACCALLUM: You're supposed to get an A in your class.SABATO: ...that I'm going to do that.STIREWALT: I'd never get into UVA.SABATO: It was really good. Now, it was a very good metaphor. Anyway, look, on the shy Tory vote, we love calling the shy Tory vote the shy Tory vote. But what it really is, is a social desirability effect. That is some people don't want to tell a live interviewer that they are for Trump, or some candidate that they may perceive as being unpopular, or they may think the interviewer doesn't want to hear. So they will often say they're undecided.They rarely say they're for the other candidate. They just claim to be undecided. And there is some evidence of that. Usually it isn't much more than a point or two or three, and there's a way to check by the way. And I'm going to be looking at this. I'm sure Chris is too. You can check the difference between online polls and live interviewer polls. Online polls have no individual listening to your answer. So the theory is at least people are more honest.MACCALLUM: More honest. Yeah.SABATO: Whereas with live interviewers, they may fib.MACCALLUM: One last quick question for you, Chris. These polls are basically pre-Brexit. Do you think he is helped by that vote at all?STIREWALT: No, I don't think it has really much effect. Now, if the whole of Europe's economy turns into a giant dumpster fire, yes, he will be affected. But I don't think that Americans particularly -- I mean they watch. I'm not saying people don't watch, aren't interested. But I don't think -- voter psychology doesn't say.MACCALLUM: But it might legitimize some of what those shy Trump voters are feeling and they might say yes, you know, the angles are right.STIREWALT: I have not known the Trump voters to be very shy to this point.MACCALLUM: Yeah. I mean, we're talking about the ones who are not shy. You know they're out there.STIREWALT: I know, I know, I know, but what I'm saying is this. Look to this for correlation. There's an indication about what's going on in the electorates because the two electorates look similar, but don't look to this for causation. The Brexit doesn't make American voters do something. American voters don't make English voters do something.MACCALLUM: That shy little Tory girl out there. All right, guys, thank you. Slim Jims and Tory. Good to see you both tonight, I think. Thanks, guys. Good to have you here.So how about this story tonight? When pop superstar Justin Timberlake tried to praise an African-American actor this weekend, he was pounded by the social media. We're going to show you what he learned about America in that process.Plus the Baltimore D.A. is now being accused of misleading the grand jury. This is a very serious charge that charged those six police officers that you see on the right-hand side of your screen. And you know charging them has not gone so well for her so far. Kevin Jackson and Daryl Parks join us next on where that could lead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: The Kelly File follow up tonight with the stunning revelation in the trial of the Baltimore Six. The Baltimore Sun is now reporting that the grand jury, which indicted the six officers that you see on your screen may have been misled about the case from the very beginning and the facts surrounding the death of suspect Freddie Gray.That claim is based on notes from the police department's lead investigator, who says that she told jurors exactly what the prosecution wanted her to tell them despite the fact that it did not line up with her own findings. Trace Gallagher live with the background on this story tonight from our west coast newsroom, Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey Martha, in the wake of officer Caesar Goodson's acquittal on second degree murder charges, there are now repeated calls for state's attorney Marilyn Mosby to drop the charges against the remaining officers. But a new report is now calling into question why the trials went forward in the first place. The Baltimore Sun has obtained and published case notes, information they received anonymously but verified independently.In those notes, lead detective Dawnyell Taylor states that the evidence she read to grand jurors deciding whether to indict the officers was misleading, writing, and I'm quoting, ""As I read over the narrative, it had several things that I found to be inconsistent with our investigation, and I thought the statements in the narrative were misquoted."" But Taylor felt conflicted about questioning the information given to her by the deputy state's attorney, so she went forward.But when the jurors asked her questions like, was Freddie Gray's arrest legal, prosecutors intervened before she could answer, with Taylor writing, ""they did not intend for me to answer any questions because all of my answers would obviously conflict with what I had just read to them."" The case notes don't say exactly what evidence Taylor considered misleading, but experts say it's unheard of for a state's attorney's office to provide investigators with prepared statements.Normally detectives and prosecutors work together to present a case. The Baltimore Sun also published an op-ed calling the report disturbing, saying that the cardinal duty of a prosecutor is to refrain from prosecuting a charge that they know is not supported by probable cause. The paper is now demanding a formal investigation, Martha.MACCALLUM: Very troubling. Trace, thank you. Joining me now with reaction, Kevin Jackson, Fox News contributor and executive director of the blackspear.net, Daryl Parks is a former attorney for both Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown's families. Good to have both of you with us. Darryl, let me start with you. What was your reaction to what you just heard?DARYL PARKS, TRAYVON MARTIN AND MICHAEL BROWN FORMER ATTORNEY: Well, I think we have to be very careful here because what we do know is that prosecutors enjoy very, very wide immunity when it comes to cases like this. I think it's also very important that this particular detective was not very specific as to what she did not agree with that the prosecutor presented.I think it's also very noted here that this particular officer was asked to get off the case by the prosecutor's office and the police department declined. Obviously there's a big rift that exists between the police department and the prosecutor's office. Certainly you have to question whether this particular detective should have been on this case.Notwithstanding that, there's also a difference of opinion that the medical examiner in this particular case said that the death was a homicide, and this detective said in her notes that it was an accident. So, I think you have to question the truthfulness and where these comments are coming from in this case.MACCALLUM: I mean the case so far, the case -- the people that have been tried so far, it's been falling apart. And that's what's raising a lot of serious questions here about this case. And you think back to Mike Nifong in the Duke case, he was disbarred and jailed for misrepresenting the evidence and lying about the evidence. We're not saying that's what's happening here, but there is the potential. If people were misled on that grand jury for some action against Marilyn Mosby, is there not, Kevin?KEVIN JACKSON: Well, the operative thing that Daryl started out by saying is we have to be very careful here. What's interesting is we have to be very careful when it's the other side that's being looked at. They weren't being very careful when they decided they were going to prosecute these six officers. And quite frankly, a lot of people look at this and say, why did it -- it was almost like they just said, you know, let's throw the proverbial crap against the wall and see what sticks.And now we decide -- he's talking about let's be careful. They should have been more deliberate when they were looking at this case in the beginning and deciding on who really might be at fault and making a determination about who really should be prosecuted because as we've seen, three of them are now innocent -- or have been found innocent, and three others are probably going to be dismissed because their cases are less than those.MACCALLUM: I just want to take a moment to show everybody Marilyn Mosby when she first came forward very forcefully and made her statement about what she felt had transpired. She talked about the youth of the city. Let's listen to that part.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MOSBY: The findings of our comprehensive, thorough, and independent investigation coupled with the medical examiner's determination that Mr. Gray's death was a homicide, which we received today, has led us to believe that we have probable cause to file criminal charges. To the youth of this city, I will seek justice on your behalf. This is a moment. This is your moment.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Well Daryl, that's the part that confuses me. I don't know why it's a moment for the youth of the city. It's a case that has to be determined to be accurate and true or not. Why is it a moment for the youth of the city?PARKS: It's a moment because Marilyn Mosby has seen and been a part of Baltimore for a long time, and she has seen that the police department of Baltimore has victimized many other youths in that city. So it's going for so long...MACCALLUM: That's not relevant. I mean, this is an individual case.PARKS: It's very relevant.MACCALLUM: It's an individual case, and it turned out so far to be falling apart.PARKS: It's not irrelevant.MACCALLUM: I got to jump in very quickly. Kevin, last 20 seconds.JACKSON: No, it's completely irrelevant because Mosby had been the state -- had been in that role for many -- for a long time. So had Shelby Blake, or I'm confusing who I'm talking about, but the mayor. So, if there was anybody who was making a mistake here...MACCALLUM: Stephanie Rawlings.JACKSON: Stephanie Rawlings-Blake -- it was those people that were in charge. So, how is it suddenly a miscarriage of justice?MACCALLUM: Hard breaks (ph). We got to go. Thank you very much, gentlemen. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JESSE WILLIAMS, ACTOR: And we're done watching and waiting while this invention called whiteness uses and abuses us, burying black people out of sight and out of mind, while extracting our culture, our dollars, our entertainment like oil, black gold. Ghettoizing and demeaning our creations, then stealing them, gentrifying our genius, and then trying us on like costumes before discarding our bodies like rinds of strange fruit.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Okay, that was actor Jesse Williams accepting the Humanitarian Award at last night's BET. Awards. The raising (ph) speech became an instant hot topic on twitter, garnering reaction from several high profile celebrities including Justin Timberlake, who tweeted, ""@iJesseWilliams tho. #inspired #BET2016.""Now, that comment has set off a vicious backlash on social media sites with some users suggesting that Timberlake is guilty of, ""appropriating black culture."" Joining me now to figure this out, Louise Mensch, she was editor of Heat Street. Louise, take us through this.  LOUISE MENSCH, HEAT STREET EDITOR: This is just an incredible story, Martha. First of all, Jesse Williams makes a speech with some people found inspiring, other people found very insulting. His mother, after all, is a white woman so, it was a controversial speech in the first place. And Justin Timberlake comes out and supports him. He says he's inspired. And what does he get for his trouble? He gets a huge backlash from social justice warriors saying that he should not dare to have an opinion.MACCALLUM: He's not allowed to discuss it. He's not allowed to say that he was inspired. So this is some of this -- you know, what he got back at him. ""So, does this mean you're going to stop appropriating our music and culture and apologize to Janet, too?"" He's talking about Janet Jackson and the Super Bowl incident. And then Justin Timberlake came back and said, ""oh, you sweet soul, the more you realize we are the same, the more we can have a conversation. Bye.""MENSCH: Right, and then he got an even worse backlash. So what's crazy about this is that Martin Luther King's dream of being judged on the content of your character is now considered racism. Let's look at this. Timberlake, he tweeted two words, inspired, and this is somehow terribly insulting. I think the idea of cultural appropriation is a complete nonsense.Are we going to tell African-Americans that they shouldn't be using novels because that's a form of art that was invented by white people? True artists like everybody to appreciate their art, whether it's rap music, whether it's novels, whether it's madrigals, whether it's sculpture. So, I really think these social justice warriors need to back off a little bit.MACCALLUM: I mean, that's the way it has always been between artists. There should be no color that is part of making your art. And as you point out, people can appreciate it across the board. I mean it's -- and basically Justin Timberlake eventually sort of apologized, right?MENSCH: I think the worst thing about this whole incident to me was not so much that he got backlash from a bunch of crazy liberals, but then he said he was sorry for it, and he was sorry he had spoken up in the first place. There's too much censorship and silencing going on. It would have been better if he said you know what, back off. I liked the speech. That would have been better.MACCALLUM: Exactly, if he stuck to his guns and basically said he was just making a compliment.MENSCH: Say bye, bye, bye.MACCALLUM: Exactly. Louise, thank you. Wow, try to figure that one out, folks. Thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight. Quick break, and we will be right back with more.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Thank you very much for joining me here tonight on ""The Kelly File."" Megyn Kelly will be back, but we covered pretty much everything, right, from Slim Jims to shy Tory and everything in between. You can go to facebook.com/thekellyfile and weigh on tonight's show. Thanks for watching everybody.Tomorrow night, Mark Cuban is going to be here, but tomorrow morning your first stop has to be America's Newsroom.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" This is a Fox News Alert. Polls in Montana have just closed. And in just a few moments, Donald Trump will join us right here, and Fox News is projecting he now has enough delegates to win the nomination.But first tonight, Fox News is projecting that Hillary Clinton has, in fact, clinched the Democratic nomination. Now, she's getting ready to address supporters in Brooklyn, New York.First, joining us, former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich here with reaction. I watched a very different Donald Trump tonight in that speech. I want to get your take on it.NEWT GINGRICH, FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I thought that he was exactly what he should be. He was presidential. He was controlled. It was thoughtful. It was a set piece speech. It's what people want from a president. They want somebody they can rely on, who's thought it through and who they can count on to follow through. I thought it was a very big step in the right direction, and I frankly felt very, very good about it.HANNITY: You have been saying that he's got to transition from primary mode -- and even David Axelrod, of all people -- I actually found myself in agreement with some of his comments, which is very rare -- suggested that you got to transition from a primary mode into a general election mode.Do you feel he accomplished that tonight after a couple of tough days?GINGRICH: Well, I think he certainly made a huge step in the right direction. If he can stay on this path and stay this disciplined, he's going to be very formidable and he's going to beat Hillary very badly this fall. She will not recover if she's caught up in a big issue election with a disciplined Donald Trump. They won't be in the same league.HANNITY: You know, he talked a lot about very specific things, and the message was clear, putting America first on foreign policy, on energy, on the economy, fixing our schools, getting -- bringing back jobs, infrastructure, all of these things, America first and here's what America first means. So there seems to be now he's drawn that line in the sand.  All right, here's Hillary, she's corrupt. I'm giving a full speech on her on Monday. But this is what the differences are. So this is going to be a choice election.GINGRICH: Well, look, I think Hillary's version, which is sort of setting the international order first, whatever that means, is a huge contrast to Donald Trump putting America first. And I think that you can go through item after item and see how dramatically different they are.I also want to warn the Clinton people. They shouldn't assume that getting these delegates means the end of the game. Philadelphia's potentially a very, very contentious convention, and the Sanders people aren't going to go away. And I think, for example, there will be a big vote over -- an anti-Israeli vote on the floor of the Philadelphia convention. And Hillary still has a long way to go before she gets secure control of her party.HANNITY: Yes, Trump actually appealed to Bernie supporters especially because he agrees with him on some of the bad trade deals America has made, and he actually talked about the Clintons winning in a rigged system. I would argue the superdelegate system is a rigged system. And you know, when you have one candidate, you know, the one with the coronation, getting nearly 600 superdelegates and the other guy getting 50, clearly, the establishment Democratic Party picked her from the get-go.GINGRICH: Well, at Gingrichproductions.com, I wrote a newsletter last week talking about the idea of oligarchy versus democracy, and ironically, it's the Democrats who've decided to create this unique senior elite group that can -- that represents 40 percent of the votes you need to win the nomination. It's totally rigged. They're going to, I think, have to abolish it.I notice that Elizabeth Warren came out the other day raising significant questions about it. A number of state parties are now opposing it. It's just a rigged game, and I think it further taints and corrupts the process by which Hillary is winning the nomination.HANNITY: Do you think that Bernie has pushed her solidly enough to the left where she's far more uncomfortable than she otherwise would have wanted to -- would want to be at this point? Does that put her in a position that she grabs Bernie, does she grab Elizabeth Warren, to get on the ticket and run with her, to appeal to the Bernie supporters that obviously feel disenfranchised?GINGRICH: Well, I think she's probably going to have either an African- American or a Latino vice presidential nominee. I think she's probably going to accept a platform much more radical than she would like, and Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are going to write a large part of that platform.But I think the bigger problem for Hillary Clinton is reality. Last Friday, we learned the U.S. last month created one job for every 8,000 Americans. Now, an economy growing so slowly, only creating one new job per every 8,000 people is an economy you can't defend, and yet she's trapped into defending it.HANNITY: She's trapped into defending it because she's defended it all along, as she has defended horrible foreign policy agenda which Donald Trump went into, and that includes Iraq, the creation of ISIS and Libya and straight on down the line.But I think it's even worse than that because one in five American families don't have a single family member in the workforce. One in six young American males 18 to 34 are either incarcerated or out of work. We've doubled the national debt. Obama will accumulate more debt than any other president before him combined, 12.4 million more people on food stamps, 10 million more people in poverty.I don't know how you run on those statistics. How do you run on those numbers? And don't those people that maybe bought into change -- don't they feel the suffering and maybe realize that they were sold a bill of goods?GINGRICH: Well, that's where Donald Trump has a huge opportunity to run a very big issue campaign to go into those neighborhoods. I mean, go into neighborhoods where people are unemployed, go into neighborhoods -- for example, Chicago's had a 50 percent increase in shootings this year. Just to run in there and say, Wouldn't you like to have a president who cared enough to try to stop the killings?Might be very attractive to African-Americans in South Side Chicago who have been totally neglected by Hillary Clinton, who's, by the way, a native of Chicago, and totally neglected by Barack Obama, who came from Chicago.HANNITY: Yes. Let me ask, you have said many times on this program that Donald Trump's at his best when he thinks big, when he goes big. I want you to expand on that thought because especially in light of the controversy this week -- and you were critical on Sunday, and I noticed, you know, the Republicans that wouldn't fight Obama were quick to jump on Donald Trump, which bothers me somewhat because if they would have fought Obama as hard as they're fighting Trump, maybe they would have stopped some of Obama's agenda, but that's a different story.But more specifically, what did you mean by going big versus small?GINGRICH: Well, offering the kind of infrastructure program that a great builder like Donald Trump could imagine, whether it's ports, highways, railroads, rebuilding America so we're a first world country again, so we're the most competitive nation in the world, rethinking all of the regulatory process to make it easy for small businesses to get started.  Trump understands exactly the importance of small businesses, and he could become the small business candidate while Hillary is the bureaucratic red tape candidate.Doing what he is doing. Let's get it up here to this level. He wants to put America first. She wants to put some vague confusing internationalism first. He wants real results. He thinks that Libya's a failure. What does she think? He thinks that Somalia is a failure. What does she think?If he gets it up to that level and keeps it at that level, he's going to beat her badly because the results are so terrible at every level, including, by the way, in the Latino community, where you can really go in and talk about jobs and education and health care and have a very strong audience that wants their children to have a better future.HANNITY: All right, let me ask you a deeper question, especially if we're going to put America first on foreign policy. I was a supporter of the Iraq war. But I always liked Trump's idea of having them pay for it and give us the oil, especially for military families that have sacrificed so much.But if we don't learn from Vietnam, where we lost 58,000 people, and we pulled out early and we didn't win the war, if we win Mosul, Tikrit, Fallujah and Ramadi only to have another president politicize the war, pull out and allow ISIS to take its place, the very cities Americans fought, bled and died for, American treasure -- do we really have to now consider the idea that America doesn't have the stomach for any long, protracted type of conflict in light of those two recent examples?GINGRICH: No. I think all we have to say is Americans are very much in favor of wars that are unavoidable, World War II when the Japanese attacked us...HANNITY: Different story.GINGRICH: ... and right after 9/11 -- right after 9/11. And Americans are very much for smart wars. Remember, Ronald Reagan built up the American military dramatically. He never engaged in a big conflict. He was very, very careful.I don't think Trump wants to run from ISIS. Trump wants to take American firepower, American intelligence capabilities, work with the Saudis, the Turks and others and destroy ISIS. But one of the differences is Trump is prepared to recognize that Russia is a real player.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: That's a more intelligence approach, isn't it?GINGRICH: ... more important than being irritated with Putin.HANNITY: You're the historian. Isn't that the more intelligent approach in light of how we've now learned wars can be politicized halfway through and that the American public appetite for long-term conflict doesn't exist?GINGRICH: Look, 500 years before Christ, Sun Tzu wrote ""The Art of War,"" which is the most...HANNITY: I've read it many times.GINGRICH: ... fascinating treatise on warfare.HANNITY: Right.GINGRICH: And he says in there, there are no good long wars.HANNITY: Yes.GINGRICH: We've been at war now for 14 years, since 9/11. If this was World War II, this would be 1955. If we were still fighting imperial Japan in 1955, we'd be torn apart as a country. So I think Trump has an instinct here...HANNITY: I agree with you.(CROSSTALK)GINGRICH: ... rebuild your military, build up your allies and insist that they take their share of the burden, and then do things decisively with minimum risk to Americans. I think that's close to what Eisenhower and Reagan believed in.HANNITY: All right. Good point. We'll continue. Newt Gingrich stays with us right after the break.And later, we're going to talk with the GOP nominee, Donald Trump. That and more on this busy news night. And of course, the polls in California closing in one hour from right now. Well, less than, that, about, well, 49 minutes. We'll continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" And this is a Fox News Alert.  Fox News can now project that Donald Trump won the Montana Republican primary.Hillary Clinton is about to hold an address to supporters in Brooklyn, New York. When she steps onto the stage, we'll dip in and take a little of that.But first, we continue with former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. I'm going to play two videos. This is now becoming a very common occurrence at Trump events. The first video's in San Jose. A young woman is surrounded by, like, a mob. Many of them have Mexican flags, and they actually come right up to her face and throw an egg at this poor woman. I'm going to run that. And then you're going to see a young man literally being chased by a mob again in San Jose. That happened the other day, and I want to get your comment on it.Let's roll this tape.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED). (EXPLETIVE DELETED). (EXPLETIVE DELETED). (EXPLETIVE DELETED). (EXPLETIVE DELETED). (EXPLETIVE DELETED).UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God. (EXPLETIVE DELETED). (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  (EXPLETIVE DELETED).UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, hey!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, now you can see a woman being punched here. You see another brawl breaking out here. Again, these are anti-Trump -- now, this kid in the red shirt, now watch. You got these guys with their faces covered. They chase him. He starts running because there are so many people following him. And then, of course, you got the media. They're following, as well. But you got a mob of people.This guy in the yellow shirt got hit so hard, you can see there he's bleeding from outside of his ear when he got hit and cold-cocked by the guy. The kid in the red shirt continues to run and gets tackled by one of these guys.This is happening at every event almost now. It's now a regular occurrence. What do you think's happening? How do you analyze this?GINGRICH: Well, this is the Scott Walker effect in Madison, where you had over 100,000 left-wingers show up to protest the results of the Wisconsin election. You see this over and over again. There's a fascism of the left which believes that it has the moral right to impose by violence and by intimidation.You'll notice it's not Trump people. You don't see this at a Sanders rally. You don't see this at a Hillary rally. And you get this on college campuses.I talked to a parent tonight whose two sons go to two very different elite schools, each of which makes the sons feel like they should be very quiet.  They should recognize that they can't be publicly conservative. They should recognize that they're supposed to feel guilty about being white.And the level of left-wing coercion and intimidation, literally fascism on the left that we are now experiencing in America, is startling. And the first standard ought to be that the police should enforce the law. These people ought to go to jail.HANNITY: Well, the San Jose mayor...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... actually blamed Donald Trump for what these people did.GINGRICH: You try to reform this corrupt system, and you're going to have the people who are winning from the corruption get really angry, and they're going to be in the streets.HANNITY: All right, a former Secret Service agent, a guy that was outside of the White House door -- I'm sure you probably met him because you were speaker...GINGRICH: I know him.HANNITY: Chris Byrne (sic). All right. So he's written this book, ""Crisis of Character."" It's coming out a month before the Democratic convention. He says Hillary Clinton lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in office. He further went on to say and talk about in the book that she has an appalling leadership style, an explosive temper, impulsive, enabled by sycophants and think the rules don't apply to her and has no business being president of the United States.How seriously should they, the American people, take those comments?GINGRICH: Well, I think people are already troubled by the corruption of the Clinton Foundation. They're already troubled by the e-mails that are breaking national security. I think those folks are going to find this book very compelling. I think the fanatic Hillary supporters are just going to shrug it off, like they shrugged everything else off.HANNITY: Yes, they probably will. Do you think this FBI primary -- do you think James Comey looking into the e-mail server scandal -- and we have a former U.S. attorney says it's a red flag that one lawyer is representing four of the people in that case earlier today.Do you think that if the FBI and James Comey puts forth a criminal referral and they decide not to indict at the Justice Department -- do you think that's a likely possibility?GINGRICH: No. I think if they recommend a prosecution, that the Justice Department is going to go along with him because I don't think Attorney General Lynch wants to go down in history as somebody who stopped the FBI from pursuing justice.HANNITY: Yes.GINGRICH: But I have to tell you, Sean, when you read today, the State Department saying it would take them 75 years to undo the e-mails of Clinton's associates -- 75 years -- you can't get a better argument for, frankly, abolishing the State Department in its current form and rehiring and creating a whole new system.I mean, this government is so out of -- you had the same thing with the IRS yesterday. This government is so out of touch with reality. The bureaucrats are so arrogant. The rules are so written against the American people that we're going to have to have a very, very deep house-cleaning to get the American government to be manageable again.GINGRICH: By the way, on the other side of the screen, looks like -- we're showing Clinton headquarters. Looks like they turned the lights down.  Apparently, there's going to be a big video that they're going to be showing.They're making a big deal of the fact that she would be the first woman nominated by a major party to run for president. Obviously, she's tried to play the gender card before. How big of a part will that play in the campaign?GINGRICH: Well, look, it is a big deal. I mean, I think at some level, virtually every woman in the country has some level of pride that we've now broken the ultimate glass ceiling in American politics.On the other hand, I find, particularly with younger women, there's not a great deal of excitement about somebody like Hillary Clinton who has been fighting this stuff since 1972, been around forever, has all these scandals surrounding her. There's not some sense that she's owed it.I think younger women actually are beginning to believe we'll get a woman president in the near future, just as we have women governors and women U.S. senators and congresswomen, and these things are all coming down the road.It is a big moment. I think people should at least recognize that it's a remarkable thing about America, just as electing an African-American was a remarkable thing about America. But I don't think that means she's going to win the election on the women's vote because I think her record on security and her record on jobs is so terrible and the cost of her health system is so expensive that most women are going to decide they can't afford Hillary Clinton.HANNITY: How do you -- if you had to rate her -- you know, she kind of seems to have supported Obama's economic policy. We know where she stands on Libya. We know that she messed up in Benghazi. We know that ISIS took over in Iraq. We know that Iran now is getting nuclear weapons and all this money that we otherwise wouldn't have given them.I got to imagine that the record matters, and I got to imagine that the millions more in poverty, on food stamps, out of work and out of the labor force maybe after eight years of Obama figured out that liberalism is not - - it may be full of great hope and promise, but reality is, it has failed once again.GINGRICH: Yes. I think there's a great opportunity for Trump to run a results versus words campaign and just point out that she has all the words down, she's got great speech writers, she sounds really good, she went to really fancy schools, but here are the results. And as I said earlier, when you learn that the U.S. last month created one job for every 8,000 Americans, you know the results are terrible.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: But I'm watching the support of Hillary and I watched eight years of Obama. I always thought America was a center-right country. Is America no longer a center-right country? Will this election tell us whether it is or not?GINGRICH: No. I think -- I think Obama was a unique moment in American history. And remember, he ran as a centrist. He promised us...HANNITY: Well, he hid his radicalism, and the media helped him.GINGRICH: You were the only person in that first campaign who correctly pointed out day after day the radical roots of Obama.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: You actually called me, told me I was going too hard on him one time. I don't know if you remember that phone call. You actually said, You need to chill out a little bit, Hannity. I think that phone call came from you.GINGRICH: I was wrong.HANNITY: I didn't mean it that way.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: No, I did not mean it that way. Have you gotten...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: We're about to have to take this speech. Did you get a call from the Trump people about either your comments on Sunday or about being VP?GINGRICH: I'm talking with a lot of Trump people. I hope to talk to Donald tomorrow. I think that everything's now moving in the right direction, and I'm very, very positive about how it's developing.HANNITY: All right, here's Hillary Clinton. She is in Brooklyn, New York.  The lights were out. Maybe they showed a movie. I heard there was going to be a video that was going to be part of this presentation tonight. She addressed her supporters. She's has now clinched the Democratic nomination.Look at that big smile! What a moment for Hillary. As she takes to the podium in Brooklyn, New York, we'll dip in and see what she has to say.(HILLARY CLINTON SPEECH)HANNITY: All right, there's Hillary Clinton accepting the Democratic nomination in Brooklyn, New York. A very enthusiastic group of Brooklyn supporters.And joining us now, Fox News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera, Fox News contributor Tucker Carlson. And did you dress for the occasion or -- what is that?GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: A benefit, a charity.HANNITY: You know, here's my take. Seriously, I'm listening very closely.  I'm thinking, oh, Wall Street, Main Street. You know, she goes through all these things. I'm like, what are you talking about? This woman made more money, $225,000 a pop, giving more Wall Street banker speeches than anybody in the history of mankind. Her and her husband in two years made $50 million sucking up to these people.RIVERA: Well --HANNITY: Come on.RIVERA: Preaching the gospel. I think it is important and it might wear down some of the glow from this admittedly historic evening.HANNITY: I thought the Trump speech was far more interesting.RIVERA: But our friend must stop self-inflicting injuries on himself, which he has done. He must grow the Republican Party, not shrink it. And I think with her tone and the tenor reaching out to the Sanders voters --HANNITY: She can claim that Donald Trump's temporarily unfit to be president, but there's a Secret Service guy that watched her for eight years and her husband in the White House and he says she's temperamentally unfit for her explosive temper.RIVERA: I agree. But you know what she's doing to do, Sean, she's going to spend $1 billion highlighting all of his intemperate remarks. The more she portrays him as a crazy person, as an unfit, temperamentally unfit person, and she does it in that modulated tone -- you notice she's stopping the shrieking now. Now she's sounding more, dare I say it, presidential.HANNITY: It will be back.RIVERA: It may, but so far, I think from her point of view, so good. I think that Trump has -- he dug himself a hole. I noticed, I thought Speaker Gingrich earlier today was chastened by his --HANNITY: No. You know what, he got what he wanted. He was sending a message. And the message was, hey, be smart. This is not a primary. This is now a general election.I'll throw that -- you know, I watched the speech. This is my take, Tucker. Every poll-tested word and phrase, cliche, I heard in the Hillary speech. Thoughts?TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. It was banal. But here's what I was so struck by. It was missing the main lesson of her race against Bernie.  How did a 74-year-old charmless Menshevik run this race until June?  Because he's actually running on something. He has an actual program.  It's insane but it speaks to the real concerns and anxieties of the middle class. What was her speech just about? Same old identity politics.HANNITY: I have got to take a quick break.When we come back, my interview with Donald Trump is straight ahead. Don't go anywhere. He'll counter what she just said.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So Fox News is now projecting Donald Trump has enough bound delegates now to clinch the Republican nomination.  Earlier tonight I spoke with the presumptive GOP nominee. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Mr. Trump, I know you released a lengthy statement today as it relates to the whole Trump University case. Included in that is a website where people can look at the comments, the approval of all those students that liked your course. Two questions regarding this. One, do you think you should have stuck to the politics of the case where the judge has a political agenda? And do you regret that at all?DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMIEE: No. I like to say what it is.  And so many people are now seeing that this whole thing is a disgrace. We have thousands of people, I don't know, exactly, like 10,000 or something thereabout, where they're really happy with it. They gave great marks, excellents and very, very good, and all of these great remarks, they wrote beautiful statements. We have thousands of these evaluations where they evaluate after the course is finished they evaluate. And I'm going through a trial. It's a disgrace.And frankly I thought, and a lot of people thought we should have won that trial in summary judgment. We should have to go through, but we're going to win it. Look, when all of these people come up and give you these great evaluations like report cards, and also the people that took the course, the people that became plaintiffs, they have evaluations that are so incredible. These are the people suing to get their money back. They want to get their money back. The evaluations are incredible.And the woman who originally brought the case was a total disaster, an absolute disaster for the plaintiff. And what happened, I mean, they saw how bad she was. They took her deposition. She was a complete and utter mess as far as her case is concerned. So they go to the judge and they asked a judge, we want to get her out of the case. He lets her out of the case and that means great, that means we win the case because the plaintiff has just dropped out of the cased. They left her out of the case but he wants the case to continue.So it's really unfair. We have thousands and thousands of people, but I'm not going to talk about it anymore. I want to talk about jobs. I want to talk about our depleted military. I want to talk about our borders and drugs pouring through into our country. I want to talk about things like that. I don't want to even talk about it anymore.HANNITY: In my investigation I found out Bill Clinton got paid $16.5 million as being the chancellor of Laureate University which is a worldwide, mostly online university, with many complaints in Rio, many complaints in Chile, many complaints in Latin American. He got paid this money. Hillary invited and included this group at a State Department dinner. And $16.5 million is a lot, and as many if not more complaints than what you have gotten. But I don't think people have heard about Laureate University. So I've got to believe that's frustrating to you.TRUMP: Not only that, an Obama appointee judge, which, say what you want.  It was an Obama appointee. And the law firm appointed or okayed by the judge, gave hundreds of thousands, I think it was $900,000 or $700,000 in speaking fees to the Clintons. It must have been a great speech. But they paid that in speaking fees to the Clintons, plus they contributed tremendous amounts of money to the campaign, plus they paid a lot of money to Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York. They gave him campaign contributions.And the whole thing is disgusting. We're going to win. Look, when you have thousands and thousands of accolades for this deal, that's why I never settle. How can you settle something --HANNITY: One last comment.TRUMP: I just want to -- I look forward to the trial.HANNITY: When you hear Republicans --(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: In the last 24 hours, I'm thinking I haven't heard some of these Republicans attack Barack Obama who was able to pass an agenda because they won't fight him as hard as they're fighting you. Is that a feeling that you have?TRUMP: Well, it's sad. I don't care where the judge comes from or where judges come from. I just want to get a fair shake. And we've had some very unfair opinions coming down. And you wonder what is going on. And I will tell you some of the Republicans, and in all fairness there's some of the people that I went through war with, and I won. And there is a lot of anxiety there. There is a lot of anger, I guess, anger. They just can't some back. They can't get over it. So they have to get over it ideally.  As to whether or not they endorse me, it's OK if they don't. But they have to get over it. They shouldn't be so angry for so long.HANNITY: As you move forward in this campaign cycle, I would assume with Hillary Clinton that everything has to be fair game. Do you see a scenario where it's possible, because there's this whole FBI primary, if you will, and James Comey, if he makes a criminal referral, now she's won the nomination. Does that change the game? Do you suspect the Democrats would want to take that nomination away from her, and would that concern you?TRUMP: Well, even Bernie Sanders yesterday was referring to a criminal problem she has with the FBI. And I will tell you that a lot of people who have done far less wrong than what she's done are right now destroyed, and destroyed, their whole life is destroyed, whether it's General Petraeus or others, and they did a fraction of what she did. So it's going to be interesting to see. She's being protected, otherwise they wouldn't have let it go on this long. But she has really done things that were wrong and illegal.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: All right, coming up, polls are about to close in the big state of California. We'll have more HANNITY right after the break. Thanks for being with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" This is a Fox News alert. Polls are about to close any second in the state of California. Stay with Fox News Channel for continuing coverage. We'll be live all night. Let not your heart be troubled. Bret, Megyn, Bill, and Martha are standing by, and they'll take you through the rest of the night. California closes in nine, eight, seven, six, five, four -- anyway, have a great night. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we win Ohio and if we win Florida, then everyone agrees, every one of these guys, that it is pretty much over.GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There is no way I would team up with Donald Trump. No way. Forget it. I'm going to be the nominee because we're going to win Ohio.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Quite frankly I think a lot of people are going to be embarrassed tonight and are going to want a refund from the money they spent on these polls because we're going to win Florida.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are seeing millions of supporters who had been supporting Marco Rubio, who had been supporting John Kasich, who are uniting behind us.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: The sights and sounds from the campaign trail today. Let's bring in our expanded panel: Here in New York, Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume; Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard; Juan Williams, columnist with The Hill, and in Washington, Charles Hurt, political columnist for The Washington Times, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, we have the first wave of exit polls. We've been kind of getting into it. Brit, what do you see?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: There's nothing in the trends of these exit polls that we see that would lead to us believe that there is going to be some staggering upset tonight. And on the issues there's a lot of consistency across these states of people's feelings on the issues. So we can probably surmise tonight that Donald Trump is going to do well. How well remains to be seen. We can suggest that Ted Cruz has a chance here of a good night, which is what all the polls leading up to tonight have suggested.John Kasich looks like he may survive the night. It doesn't look as good for Marco Rubio based on what the exit polls are suggesting about the way people feel about the issues.But we will know, Bret, I think tonight when all is said and done a lot more about this sort of overarching question now of whether Trump can make it to the convention with enough to be nominated on the first ballot or whether he will fall short of that and who then might convention turn to if not he for the nomination. And that of course is a question that people have been asking for a long time. We'll get closer to the answer to that tonight.BAIER: Steve, if Marco Rubio doesn't win Florida, he is saying today that he is going on no matter what to Utah tomorrow. But something tells me that the path is tough to sell.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes, I think it would be very tough to sell. If you listen to the things that he said before, he said the nominee of the party will have won Florida. He said a number of things that I think would be thrown back in his face. There is some question as to what happens with his delegates that he's already won if he were to not continue in the race. And depending on how that question is answered might determine whether he suspends or whether he actually gets out.But I do think to Brit's point whether this is going to the convention or whether Trump gets 1,237, there is some interesting numbers inside of this on the head-to-head races. If you believe that after this we're likely to be looking at effectively a two-man race between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, you look at Missouri. Cruz beats Trump head to head 50-41. North Carolina, Cruz beats Trump 50-43. Ohio, Trump beats Cruz, 46-38. So if you're the Cruz campaign and you want to get this to a two-man race, that's your argument. You say we're beating him in some places head to head.BAIER: But Charles Krauthammer, if you are the Cruz campaign you also need a Kasich win to stop the momentum of Donald Trump in Ohio.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Absolutely. And I think whether Kasich stays in or not, I think it's not going to affect the Cruz campaign effectively after tonight. It looks as if Trump and Cruz are the two plausible candidates to come out of the convention. Maybe not arrive with a majority. If they have pluralities, it will be large ones. But it would be hard to reach down to a Kasich or a Rubio or anybody outside the party at that point.So even without a one-on-one, with Kasich, let's say he stays in. Let's say he does well and Rubio doesn't. He will take a few of the delegates away from Trump. In that sense he helps Cruz. To me, of course, the lead indicator here was the result in the North Mariana Islands. I think the way that goes, you really get a sense of --(LAUGHTER)KRAUTHAMMER: And I asked myself, what's happening in the South Mariana Islands, and do we even own them? I suspect they're probably Japanese. But that to me is a leading indicator.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: That's good. Let's play, Juan, this ad that is now running and Donald Trump's response to it. It is an ad by this group, this super PAC that is essentially the never Trump group.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ""Bimbo,"" ""dog,"" ""pig,"" real quotes from Donald Trump about women.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ""Women, you have to treat them like --""UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is how Donald Trump talks about our mothers, our sisters, our daughters.TRUMP: I have seen it. And it was a Romney deal, who ran one of the worst races in the history of presidential politics. It's a lot of sour grapes. Women, if you look at women's polling, leaving the booths, women, I'm leading by a lot.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: And if you look at the exit polls, Juan, for example in Florida, North Carolina, not Illinois, but Missouri, he is doing pretty well with women.JUAN WILLIAMS, THE HILL: He does better with men, but he is still doing sufficiently well with women. It doesn't look like a huge gap. There is a gap but it's not huge in these states at least according to the exit polls that we're seeing so far. This is about a $35 million ad buy, Bret. So a big buy by the anti-Trump forces. Some call them establishment Republican forces.I think it's clearly aimed at late deciders. The question was if you look at the past few primary caucuses, late deciders were getting split up. Trump had the early vote, especially people who voted absentee. Was that going to make a difference tonight specifically I think in the state of Florida? And what we can see so far from the exit polls is that hasn't played out.BAIER: Charlie Hurt, I laid out the delegate math. And there is a chance that these other candidates prevent Trump from getting to 1,237, the necessary delegates needed to clinch. It is an uphill battle to get 65 percent of the delegates remaining if he loses Ohio.CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES: But it is easier going forward than it was previously just because of the winner-take-all terms, assuming the big states going forward. But that said, you know, obviously, you know, Marco Rubio can stay in the race if he loses Florida after this if he wants to. There is no path to him getting the 1,237 that he needs. And it would be difficult for Kasich or Cruz. So their only hope obviously is to deny Trump the clean victory there. But then they set off the problem that we've all been talking about for weeks now.I was really interested in that ad, as well. It's a brutal ad. And it's so effective I couldn't believe the Republicans had actually put it together. But I think that one thing that is important to remember, and Juan noted on this, that Donald Trump is not doing -- he is obviously performing much better among men than he is among women, but his gap with women is smaller than the gap that Hillary has with men. And I think that that's an important thing to probably keep in mind. And this is with this onslaught of negative ads hitting Trump that Hillary isn't having to buffet right now.BAIER: It's going to be interesting to see as it develops tonight.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
