This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, big news from the campaign trail is now raising the possibility of a general election match-up between businessman Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. It was a big day for political news, starting with a new ABC News poll showing Donald Trump dominating the GOP field. In the national survey, he sits ten points ahead of his nearest competitor, Dr. Ben Carson. But the really big news in this poll is that Trump is now number one among Republicans in two important categories. First, they think he is the candidate with the best chance to win the nomination. And, second, the candidate with the best chance to win the general election. The other big story today concerns the democratic ticket. And some of the best news Mrs. Hillary Clinton could have hoped for.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Unfortunately, I believe we're out of time. The time necessary to mount a winning campaign for the nomination.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And with Vice President Joe Biden officially out of the 2016 context, and Mrs. Clinton's poll average now 22 points ahead of her nearest competitor, the political analysts are starting to drill down on what it would mean if these two, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, are the last ones standing.Joining me now, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor.  And Dana Perino, co-host of ""The Five,"" author of, ""And The Good News Is.""  And former press secretary to President George W. Bush. Good to see you both tonight.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": Thank you.KELLY: Stirewalt, let me start with you. Since on election night, you're part of the decision depths that actually has to crunch numbers and figure out what groups need to go where and what percentage of the vote?  Let's just start with a comparison between Donald Trump and Mitt Romney.  When it comes to the minority vote. Because many said Romney needed to win more minorities, if he had one more Hispanics, in particular, he would be president of the United States right now.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, sure. Now, you can look at it in a bunch of different ways. You could say Mitt Romney needed to do a lot better with Hispanic voters who are small but growing, rapidly growing share of the electorate. Or he needed to do a lot better with white voters who, in that election, where I think 72 percent of the electorate. So, basically, for Romney to have won, he would have need to either jack up his share of the white vote to levels probably beyond greater than any republican or any candidate or republican candidate has got in the modern era or he would have had to have done substantially  better with minority voters.KELLY: Uh-hm.STIREWALT: But he was stuck in between and got marooned and defeated by about a pretty stout five million votes.KELLY: Uh-hm. And so Trump will be looking to do something different, if he's the nominee. He needs to drive up his numbers with whites to, you know, historically unprecedented levels. Or he needs to reach out to minorities in order to win a general election contest. And the latest polls Dana on that, on the minority numbers, show the following.  Look at this. So this is Trump's favorability. With African-American, he has a 68 percent unfavorable rate with Hispanics, it's 82 percent unfavorable which tells you what?PERINO: That he's got -- he dug himself a fairly big hole. One of the things that happened to Mitt Romney, do you remember when he used the phrase self-deportation?KELLY: Uh-hm.PERINO: That was one of the phrases that really hurt him with Hispanics, they got 27 percent of the vote. They felt like he needed to get about 35 percent of the vote. Because of the increases in population that Chris is mentioning, Donald Trump or whoever the GOP candidate is going to be would need about 40 percent. A note on the rapidly growing number of Hispanics. Do you know that every single month in America, 50,000 Hispanics turn 18-years-old. Which means that the voter registration and get out the vote is so important with an 82 percent unfavorable, there's no doubt that Donald Trump has a lot of work to do.  And I think that he has to start really concentrating on that if he plans to try to bring that number to something that he can actually use to win the election.KELLY: Stirewalt, if you look at poll by poll, Trump versus Hillary Clinton, you know, he's head of match-ups, he wins some, she wins some depends on, you know, the poll. And the Real Clear Politics average of all the polls, she beats him by a couple of points, on average, she'll beat him in the general election according to these polls. But what would be the main impediment to her winning against Donald Trump.STIREWALT: Well, the main impediment she would have would be against Donald Trump would be that he would be trying to steal plenty of liberal votes from her. Remember, his base is not the conservative part of the Republican Party. His base is with self-described liberal to moderate Republicans. A conservatives of Republicans line-up with Ben Carson and then you moved on from there on to Rubio, Fiorina, Bush, et cetera.KELLY: But in a lot of these polls, he's leading with conservatives when you break the polls down. He is leading with the conservatives.STIREWALT: No question. But he has a set of views. He would have to try to raid her White voters essentially. He would have to try to steal march on her and raid her White voters while she was simultaneously trying to get National Security hawks and other people off of him.KELLY: Wow!STIREWALT: It would be a terrible mess. But it would come down to this.KELLY: Confusing.STIREWALT: It would be very confusing. But it would come down to this. You've got undecided voters leftover. The key there would be how well Donald Trump would do with white women. And that's where I think his biggest challenges, I don't think he could get his numbers up among minorities to sufficiently to come and say, he'd have to do it with White women and he has a bigger problem there than I think people probably realize.KELLY: He's had some troubles even with GOP women. Although he's doing a little better with them now, Dana.PERINO: Yes.KELLY: But look at the numbers on women. We'll put them on the board. This is all women. Not just GOP. Unfavorable, 62 percent.PERINO: That's high. That's high. It's not insurmountable, I think for him. And I think what's been happening the last several months is, you know how it is when you say you have a big event to go to. Say at this point, it's the election. You need a dress to wear at the event. So, for the last several months, people have been walking by the windows going, oh, that might look good at that event. So, they're window shopping.KELLY: That will make your butt look big.PERINO: And so, now they're about to take three-to-four outfits into the dressing room. Okay? So now, they're thinking, well, could I see myself voting for a Donald Trump? Now, there might be some women who say, absolutely not. And that there might be an increasing number that say, yes, okay, maybe I could say that. Let me hear some more. He's going to have to try to persuade them. He has a whole there. But --  KELLY: Okay. But here's --PERINO: I think it's the whole with Hispanics that's even more difficult.KELLY: And the Republicans have been working for months to try to build up support with Hispanics. It's not like they misunderstood what happened with Romney and Hispanics.  PERINO: Two years of a huge amount of effort. And the Mexicans are rapists and the comments that he made back then which he's not exactly apologized for, but he said that was taken out of context. It was too much. That actually that stuck and that's the other thing about --  KELLY: Well, and his illegal immigration policies have hurt him with his Hispanic votes.PERINO: Definitely.KELLY: But helped him immensely, Stirewalt --PERINO: That's right.KELLY: When it comes to the GOP voters. And that's one of the reasons why his numbers with were so high with the republican base.STIREWALT: And that's my point, I think that it would mostly be for Trump a lost cause with none white voters. He might do a little better here, he might do a little better there. But when you come down to it, his only shot would be a historic, unprecedented increase among his share of white voters. He have to jack up the percentage of White voters.KELLY: And the White voting electorate is shrinking the country should know. It's down, I mean, considerably from the Reagan years and so on. So, the electorate is shrinking on when it comes to White voters and so, he would need an even greater proportion.  STIREWALT: He'd have to reverse the trend in that regard, which is doable. But then inside that, again, with female voters, he would have to find a way to get female voters, moderate, independent or even democratic- leaning, white women away from Hillary Clinton. And let me tell you something, she's going to be tough to beat on white women. She struggled with them on a period of time. But her poll numbers have consolidated.  And she is doing progressively better. Provided she doesn't have catastrophic e-mail syndrome failure explosion --KELLY: That's the risk.STIREWALT: That's the risk.KELLY: That's the risk for the Democrats and Joe Biden staying out.  Because now, I mean, assuming Sanders can't get it done, it's -- she may lock it up. But she's got a major potential liability. And there ain't no back-up plan. Although Joe Biden saying, hey, you know --STIREWALT: He's available.KELLY: Unfortunately, I'm out, but you know, if you need me.PERINO: The good news for Donald Trump is that with white republican women, they actually kind of like her, like him better than her. I mean --KELLY: Yes. Yes. They're not going to vote just based on gender.  Okay, great to see you both.STIREWALT: You bet.KELLY: Also, tonight, dishonesty, politics and war. Two politicians caught blatantly misleading.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: Do you believe that American boots should stay on the ground in Afghanistan?DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place. I've never said we've made mistake going into Afghanistan.ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: This -- our question was about Afghanistan.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Uh-hm. And Mr. Trump is not alone. Vice President Joe Biden also on the hot seat, not to mention Hillary Clinton. Those three again, when we come back.And Pete Hegseth will weigh in on how this place with the troops.Plus, after this cop was shot dead in New York, the judge who put his killer on the street is now defending his decision. Former LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman and former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik are here on the growing controversy.And we are now less than 24 hours away from what could be a dramatic showdown between Hillary Clinton and the select committee investigating Benghazi. Tomorrow, she testifies. And tonight, we will hear from both a member of the committee and a good friend of one of the men murdered by the terrorists who attacked our facility in Benghazi.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She's lying. She's absolutely lying.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, dishonesty, policy and war. Two leading politicians. Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden were caught this week misleading on their positions about war and the American military.  First up, Donald Trump who touts himself as a straight talker. Just yesterday, he told CNN that he supported the war in Afghanistan and did not believe it was a mistake. That was news to the anchors who have heard exactly the opposite from Mr. Trump just two weeks ago. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CAMEROTA: Let me just read to you what you said on October 6th about Afghanistan. You said we made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.TRUMP: No, we made a -- no, no.CAMEROTA: ""We had real brilliant thinkers that didn't know what the hell they were doing, and it's a mess.""TRUMP: We made a mistake going into Iraq. I've never said we made a mistake going into Afghanistan.CAMEROTA: This -- our question was about Afghanistan. That day on October 6th...TRUMP: Okay. I've never said that. Okay. Wouldn't matter. I never said it.CUOMO: What about Afghanistan? Do you believe that American boots would stay on the ground in Afghanistan to stabilize a situation?TRUMP: I wouldn't totally disagree with it except, you know, at some point, they're going to be there for the next 200 years. We made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place. We had a real brilliant thinkers that didn't know what the hell they were doing.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Here it is again, shorter.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CUOMO: Do you believe that American boots should stay on the ground in Afghanistan?TRUMP: We made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.I've never said we've made a mistake --CAMEROTA: This -- our question was about Afghanistan.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: An obvious reversal. But he is not the only one. Vice President Joe Biden yesterday tried to revise his own history on the raid that killed Usama bin Laden. Back in 2011, when President Obama was deciding whether to authorize that mission, the President looked around the situation room and asked for his top advisor's opinions. What did Joe Biden say? Depends on when you ask him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: He walked out of the room and walked upstairs. I said -- I told him my opinion. That I thought he should go, but follow his own instincts.It's got to be, Joe, what do you think? I said we owe the man a direct answer. Mr. President, my suggestion is, don't go. We had to do two more things to see if he's there. He walked out and said I'll give you my decision.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Here it is again. Shorter.BIDEN: I told him my opinion that I thought he should go.I said, Mr. President, my suggestion is don't go.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: So does this matter? A Fox News contributor. Joining us now is Pete Hegseth, a Fox News contributor as well as an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran. He's now the CEO of Concerned Veterans for America. Pete, thanks for being here. Does it matter?PETE HEGSETH, CEO, CONCERNED VETERANS FOR AMERICA: Megyn, it definitely matters. History matters because it frames what we do in the future. I mean, Vice President Biden, they say that victory has -- John F. Kennedy said, victory has a hundred fathers. Defeat is an orphan. I mean, when he said that yesterday, he was still considering whether he was going to run for president. And he wanted to be the guy in hindsight who said, Mr. President, I thought you should do it and I believe you should do it, especially in setting and making sure he was on par with Hillary Clinton.So, this is political expediency, this is rewriting history to make it looked like he's on the right side of history as it pertains to the Bin Laden raid. As far as Donald Trump, he is just flat out changing his position. And, frankly, I think falling into the narrative of the left, and he's done this time and time again on Iraq, the whole thing is a disaster. He ignores the surge. In Afghanistan, he's so militaristic.  He's got to be for something. So, he's got to be in Afghanistan. But yet, he wouldn't tear up the Iran deal and he thinks he can work with Putin. It looks a lot like Barack Obama's foreign policy. He's going back and forth, he's been good on a lot of domestic stuff, but, internationally, I don't know where Donald Trump is.KELLY: I mean, two weeks ago in Afghanistan, he told those CNN anchors that it was a mistake to go in. It was two weeks, not two years.  And then two weeks later, completely denied that he had ever said it.HEGSETH: No, it's unacceptable. It shows I think a shallowness in the understanding of that region, the implications of words on the international stage. Also, he said, you know, what are we going to be there, for 200 years? That's very similar to what Obama said to John McCain in 2008 about Iraq. What are we going to be there, for 100 years?  It's a strawman argument that doesn't actually look at the strategic ramifications of finishing wars properly. And as a result, he devolves into, the whole Iraq war is a disaster. And we shouldn't be in Afghanistan as well. And then he realizes, well, that's not a great position. So, two weeks later, he tries to make us all pretend like, no, no, I didn't say that. I said, I want to be in Afghanistan. That's not clarity. That's not leadership. That is waffling back and forth on really critical issues especially for guys that's serving those places and believe in the legacy of finishing them properly.KELLY: And then you've got Hillary Clinton who, depending on who you ask, may or may not have done the same thing. Listen to what she said about the Bin Laden raid versus what the Vice President said about how it went down just yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It was a really tough decision to advise on. Because, you know, we didn't have the smoking gun.I was one who recommended to the President that he go ahead. And his advisors were split.BIDEN: There were only two people who were definitive. And were absolutely certain. Leon Panetta said go and Bob Gates has already publicly said this, don't go.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: So now people are accusing her along with Vice President Joe Biden of some sort of stolen glory. Trying to get in on these decisions that sent men in that particular case into harm's way. And it worked out well, as we know --HEGSETH: Uh-hm.KELLY: -- in the Abbottabad raid.HEGSETH: Thank God!KELLY: But after the fact, they come out and say, it was all me. And this is not just your average political lying, this involves war in the military, Pete, something we tend to hold as sacred in this country.HEGSETH: This involves the 3 a.m. phone call, this is what Presidents get paid to do. To make this critical decisions. And the Vice President and the Secretary of State in this case, they were going on behind after it happened, the way they wanted to and try to rewrite the history to make it look like they were the ones at the critical moment that made call. You have to give credit to Barack Obama for making that call in light of what was clearly a conflicted situation.KELLY: Right.HEGSETH: The people in a room and behind closed doors giving him different perspectives. And Hillary Clinton needs this because her foreign policy record is terrible. From Libya to elsewhere to Iran, I mean, she's got serious problems so she is clinging to this Biden -- do the same thing.KELLY: Uh-hm.HEGSETH: It's politics and war. And you need -- what George W. Bush knew, love him or hate him. If he knew where he stood and he was going to do it whether he was popular or not, that's what you need with leadership and we're not seeing it across the board right now with the three folks we just talked about.KELLY: Pete Hegseth, it's great to see you. Thanks for being here.HEGSETH: Thank you.KELLY: And speaking of leadership, our next guest have a new book out on this very topic. Leif Babin and Jocko Willink are two decorated former Navy SEAL officers who led the most highly decorated highly special operations units of the entire Iraq war. They are the authors of ""Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win."" Leif also happens to be married to our own Jenna Lee, a Fox News anchor. It's great to see you both.JOCKO WILLINK, FORMER NAVY SEAL OFFICER: Great to see you.KELLY: Thank you for being here.So, it's great timing on an incredible book. And congrats on all the great early reviews that it's received. But leadership and the principles that you espoused on this book among others are, when you're wrong, when you make a mistake, you admit it.  WILLINK: Absolutely. And, you know, I just got asked earlier, did I ever make mistakes in my career? And the answer is, absolutely. I made all kind of mistakes. When I did, I stepped up to the plate and said hey, guys, this is my fault. What can we do to fix it?KELLY: What does it say about somebody when they refused -- they refused to admit a mistake?WILLINK: I actually feel embarrassed for them. Because it's just a complete lack of leadership and lack of ownership.KELLY: Uh-hm. You said that this is actually the number one characteristic of a good leader is the willingness to acknowledge your mistakes and then develop a plan to recognize reality and develop a plan thereafter.LEIF BABIN, FORMER NAVY SEAL OFFICER: That's correct. If you can't own up to mistakes, if all you're doing is blaming and making excuses, then you're never going to actually develop that plan to overcome those challenges.KELLY: Uh-hm.BABIN: And I think what you just saw there is really, that shows a lack of belief in the mission. That's also something that's really important for leaders. Is that you believe in the greater strategic goals of what you're trying to accomplish. So that you can explain that, the why, to your troops --  KELLY: You know, we've heard a lot of that about -- you know, not as much Afghanistan, but a lot of second guessing on Iraq saying it wasn't worth it, that we never should have been in there. That something Trump openly says that he didn't support the Iraq war. You guys fought there, you captured the city of Ramadi, your unit, what do say?WILLINK: We absolutely believed in what we were doing. And, looking back, I know that there was great sacrifices made. It actually sickens my heart now to see the black flag of ISIS flying over Ramadi. But I know that what we were doing was the right thing to do. We were facing a pure evil enemy. And we were fighting them there, so they won't come here. And on top of that, there's Iraqi people that live in that city. And they absolutely wanted us there. They wanted to be stable and free and live in peace.KELLY: I know in this book, not only in this book, but in your life, you have seminars where you teach guys and gals about leadership and you've helped not only military guys but families. Marriages including. Leif, so you 'married to our own beautiful Jenna Lee. You have a beautiful little baby boy, Trace. And how -- how does this advice in this book translate to families and marriages and people who might be looking not just help their businesses but their lives?BABIN: I think it absolutely translates directly. And if you take ownership and look in the mirror instead of just casting blame, it makes a difference across the spectrum. We actually had a client that we worked with, who told us that ""Extreme Ownership"" saved his marriage. That he was blaming everything on his spouse, and he had to look in the mirror after we talked about this and said, what can I do to change the opposite.KELLY: Now, do you do this with Jenna or you just said, right upfront? You're right, honey. I was wrong, I was wrong again.BABIN: You know what? I certainly take (INAUDIBLE) mistakes. I don't think she would agree with that.KELLY: I'm going to email her right now.It's great to see you guys again. The book is ""Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win."" And if you guys -- just look at their bios and see what these two guys have done, and you will actually know their story by this book because they actually what they're talking about when it comes to how to lead. Good to see you both.BABIN: Thank you, Megyn.WILLINK: Thank you.KELLY: Well, we also have big developments tonight with the New York City police officer shot dead last night. As the judge who released his killer is now defending his decision.Plus, another stunning twist in the story of Texas teen behind the school project that looked like a bomb. And then, why are towns now canceling Halloween? Yes, schools over concerns about diversity.  Halloween is now racist.Dana Loesch is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: A terrifying blow dealt to the students at Seth Boyden Elementary in New Jersey. After the school called off all Halloween celebrations citing concerns about diversity as the reason. And they are not alone. Apparently, according to some, Halloween is now racist.Dana Loesch is the host of ""Dana"" on The Blaze TV and a big fan of the holiday, unbeknownst to us. But she has the whole history of Halloween she's going to disclose to us. So, Dana, they say the little cupcakes cannot be allowed to celebrate Halloween at school because it's offensive to the school's diverse student body. And you say?DANA LOESCH, HOST OF ""DANA,"" THE BLAZE TV: Well, I'm sure it's really upsetting to the Frankenstein and Dracula and Master Chief and Rainbow Bright and all of the other fictional communities that are out there.  That's what kids dressed up as.KELLY: This is you. That whole picture.LOESCH: Yes. My mom dressed me up as a drunk hobo. It was probably one of the moist political incorrect costume ever conceived.(LAUGHTER)I carried around an empty beer can, it was amazing. Child services would have been called previously.KELLY: Yes. You would be booted right out of that school district in New Jersey today for a different kind of offense. But they're saying that this is a kind of segregation they cannot tolerate. That 20 percent of the student body did not dress up. And therefore, in the interest of being inclusive of everyone, no one may celebrate Halloween.LOESCH: These are adults that are pushing their boring adult life baggage onto these kids and ruining their Halloween. What would our lives be, if it without thriller and Vincent Price and Trick or Treating or like the really bad honeybee candy.KELLY: Just go do it in a door-to-door at Halloween night? You don't need to do in school.LOESCH: Right. No, exactly. And you would think progressives would love this. Because this is their holiday. I mean, you go door to door and you get free things while appropriating fictional identity.  KELLY: That's like the Bernie Sanders approach to Halloween. I don't know if it's all progressives. But here's the thing, it's not just the school district in New Jersey.  It's also, there was one in Connecticut.  And the parent there was so ticked off. The school had to reverse itself.  But they said the same thing, respect for diversity. The goal is for all children to feel comfortable. What about the 80 percent who are really enjoying it?LOESCH: Exactly. And I don't know what's wrong with those 20 percent. If they don't want to dress up, that's no skin off of our backs.  I mean, it didn't bother me if nobody wanted to dress up. And if people are upset over a Halloween costume and the fact that it's an 80/20 situation, they need to re-evaluate the priorities in their lives, Megyn.KELLY: Yes.LOESCH: They're ruining Halloween for kids.KELLY: Not only that, the parents said, why don't you offer another activity for the 20 percent who don't want to, you know, go to the Halloween parade. Why does the 80 percent have to give up something that's been a tradition in this country for a long, long time. But that is not how they felt in New Jersey or Connecticut. So, we'll see. We'll continue to follow it. And by the way, the same school in New Jersey, they are allowing harvest festival, Turkey trot, book fair fun night and dancing classrooms. Now, you want to talk about alienation of kids.LOESCH: That's some punishments.KELLY: Dancing classrooms. Good luck getting 80 percent participation in that. Good to see you, Dana.LOESCH: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: We were forced to do the square dancing. Did you ever have to do it, James?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.KELLY: Yes, right. Very awkward. You had to touch other students and like, now you get, run up charges. Also, tonight, we are now just 12 hours away from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, testifying before the Benghazi committee. It starts tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. Her camp contends the questioning will be highly partisan, but one veteran who knew one of the four men killed in Benghazi tells a very different story.  He joins us next.And we have live pictures, look at this, of the empire state building here in New York City tonight, bathed in blue for the police officer killed last night at just age 33. And now the judge who released his killer is defending the decision.Former LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman and former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik are here. Don't go away, that's next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL BRATTON, NYC POLICE COMMISSIONER: A five year veteran of the New York City Police Department was killed in the line of duty -- murdered. He is the fourth New York City police officer murdered in this city in the last 11 months.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRATTON: . fourth New York City police officer murdered in this city in the last 11 months.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: The fact is we have four dead Americans.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand.CLINTON: Was it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for walk they decided they go kill some Americans. What's difference at this point does it make?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her sometimes contentious testimony more than two years ago, following the terror attack that killed four Americans at our consulate in Benghazi, Libya. It's now roughly 12 hours until Mrs. Clinton testifies again. And there are lots of questions from those who knew the four men lost that night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PATRICIA SMITH, MOTHER OF SEAN SMITH WHO WAS KILLED IN 2012 BENGHAZI ATTACK: I still want to know -- I saw on TV, these bloody finger prints on the walls over there. I asked specifically, are those my son's finger prints crawling down the wall, the bloody fingerprints. Nobody ever got back to me on that. Are those his fingerprints? Were those his fingerprints? What happened?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, a woman who had the chance to question Mrs. Clinton tomorrow. Congresswoman Martha Roby, Republican from Alabama. Great to see you tonight, ma'am, thank you for being here. So, what of that.REP. MARTHA ROBY, R-ALA., BENGHAZI SELECT COMMITTEE: Thank you for having me.KELLY: Is the plan to get into specifics like that, because the last time around, it was a lot of grand standing.ROBY: Well, first and foremost, we need to stay with calm. Unfortunately, because a lot of dragging of feet and stone walling by the State Department and others is taking us a long time to get here. And of course, our hearts go out to the families whom we've met with of the victims, the four Americans who unnecessarily lost their lives, and that's the charge of this committee. This committee was charged to find the truth. We're on a fact-finding mission to.KELLY: But to my point -- you know, is that going to happen? Because the last time what we saw was a lot of puffery by Republicans, who seem to want to appear smart on camera, but not to get answers to questions.ROBY: Well this is the first time this committee has had the opportunity to speak to Secretary Clinton. And of course, we also now have information that we didn't have in the past. Even though it took a really long time to get it, we now have documents to ask questions that will fill in the missing pieces. Secretary Clinton, this is -- this investigation is not about her. She's just a small piece of it, are an important piece, but a piece of it. We've done.KELLY: Is it seem -- did you up all the questioning to those on the committee who are, you know, most adept at asking question in any other former prosecutors, for example?ROBY: Well certainly, we had interest based on our experiences. But, you know, the questions are for her to get -- for her to have an opportunity to be forthright with the committee, to show us candor, to answer our questions so that we can have a report that is complete, on behalf of these four Americans that unnecessary lost their lives. This is a fact-finding mission and we have -- she was secretary of state at the time and it's incumbent upon her to answer the questions that relate to her role and which has took place.KELLY: And you have the e-mails the last time around. That's the bottom line to those who say this is repetitive.ROBY: Well, we still don't have all the e-mails.KELLY: I know. You didn't have any of them last time because she wouldn't.ROBY: Right.KELLY: She wouldn't be producing them. We'll be watching, Congressman. Thank you for being here.ROBY: Thank you so much for having me.KELLY: Joining me now, Brandon Webb, he's a former Navy SEAL and a close friend of Glen Doherty who was murdered in Benghazi. He's also in the author of the book, ""Among Heroes: A U.S. Navy SEAL's Story of Friendship, Heroism, and the Ultimate Sacrifice.""Richard Socarides is also here. He's a White House senior adviser under President Bill Clinton and a democratic strategist. Thank you both for being here. Brandon, what specifically are you going to be looking for tomorrow?BRANDON WEBB, AUTHOR, ""AMONG HEROES"": I mean the big question I have for Hillary is. Is why didn't she hold Patrick Kennedy and Charlene Lamb accountable? I mean those, those are the two individuals at the State Department. All the evidence points to their negligence with the security situation.KELLY: They were warned. They were told. It was deteriorating. They needed more help.WEBB: Charlene Lamb's office getting the cables, that there's continued request for help, and nobody's held accountable. And as a Navy SEAL chief petty officer, one of the first things we learn about leadership is holding yourself accountable, and holding your subordinates accountable. So I really want to know how are these people still able to operate as business as usual because they.KELLY: So your position is not necessary Hillary shouldn't have known everything. It's that she knows who is responsible and she didn't do anything.WEBB: Yeah, I understand that her role as the secretary of state, she was not involved in day-to-day operations. But clearly, Kennedy and Charlene Lamb were -- and all the evidence that in the reporting that we did on (inaudible) points to just extremely negligence on Kennedy and Charlene Lamb's part.KELLY: But why is she protecting them? Give me particular.WEBB: Yeah, we're.KELLY: Give me particular. And that is the same guy, Patrick Kennedy, who is overseeing her -- processing on her e-mails. And the one who should have been keeping shop on those e-mails.WEBB: A guy that also held Ambassador Stevens' personal laptop and his dairy in his office for almost 30 day before turning it over to the FBI. So there's a clear case of a lack of transparency and a lack of accountability across the board. And that's very concerning to me.KELLY: Richard, I know the democrats say look, there are seven committees have investigating Benghazi, right? So, why they needed eight?RICHARD SOCARIDES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Seven bipartisan committees.KELLY: But to the point about the.SOCARIDES: Including the one that Congresswoman Roby chaired.KELLY: But you.SOCARIDES: Including the one that she previously chaired.KELLY: You know that in the law, if you have a case and the case goes all the way to settlement, and you find out after the verdict or the settlement that the other side didn't produce critical documents to you, you can re-open the case.SOCARIDES: Well.KELLY: She did not produce her e-mails.SOCARIDES: All that material was. I think all of those materials -- we'll know tomorrow if they have anything new. I mean that.KELLY: It wasn't them.SOCARIDES: They've suggested that they may have some new e-mails but, but not from her, right? I mean they've suggested that they have some other e-mails.KELLY: All of her e-mails were withheld.SOCARIDES: Well, Megyn.KELLY: For all of those primary investigations.SOCARIDES: OK, so let just take a step back here, right? I mean the congresswoman said, ""This is not about her."" I mean that is crazy. Obviously, tomorrow in her testimony is all about her. Obviously, this committee -- this whole process that the committee to involve this all about her. The House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, in fact, we set up this committee so to push down her poll number. I mean.KELLY: Certainly about her impart, but.SOCARIDES: Well, I mean listen.KELLY: Is that so wrong?SOCARIDES: Listen.KELLY: Is that so wrong?SOCARIDES: No, I don't -- I actually think that the American people know that this has become very political that this is not an effort to find out really what happened in Benghazi. This is not an effort to improve diplomatic security.KELLY: How can you say that in light (ph) about mother you just saw a clip from CNN.SOCARIDES: I know, listen.KELLY: And also, Brandon. His best friend was killed.SOCARIDES: And you know -- and Hillary Clinton lost a very close friend and Ambassador Chris Stevens that night. So you don't think she mourns her Ambassador Stevens as we all do.KELLY: Go ahead.SOCARIDES: I mean I want to say thank you for your service. And I think that it is true -- obviously, everybody thinks this is a tragedy what happened. But it's a tragedy that affected all of us. And these were really an effort to get at.KELLY: I understand that, but she.SOCARIDES:KELLY: But she was in charge. I want to give him the last word.WEBB: Yeah, I mean there's talk and then there's action. I mean you could -- I can listen to politicians say, ""Oh, my heart goes out to the families."" But the fact is, one of the issues that came up from all the attention on the Benghazi committee is, there's always 50 families of contractors since 1983 in the Beirut barracks bombing who have not been paid to death benefit. Like my best friend Glen Doherty. His family -- so we have an American here who give his life from Benghazi, his family goes to the White House, they got a bunch of lip service from Hillary. And at the end of the day, the family has left holding the bag as far as, not even getting a basic death benefit to bury their family members.KELLY: Right. You got a $3,000 payment and that was it.WEBB: And you've got two initiatives held up in the House right now. You have an initiative of the (inaudible) and my friend Glen's name. That's held up in the House, it is supposed to reform the Defense base Act and provide relief for these families. You have an initiative for.KELLY: And we're not there.WEBB: Yeah.KELLY: We're not there. Dianne Feinstein and another.WEBB: Yeah, and the CIA.KELLY: Put the brakes on. I got to go.WEBB: The Senate Intel committee also held up and these career- politicians. I think Americans are just sick of this paralysis by analysis this time for action and take care of these families.KELLY: Thank you both. I appreciate it.We have live pictures of a moving site right now here in New York City. The Empire State Building fade in blue for a young police officer killed in the line of duty last night.And tonight, the judge who released his killer is defending his decision. We share that next when former LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman and former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik, joins us live.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking Tonight. A New York judge defending his decision to release a convicted criminal back on to the streets of New York. A criminal who is charged just moments ago with murdering Police Officer Randolph Holder, the fourth New York City cop to lose his life this year. Trace Gallagher live in our west coast news room. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, LOS ANGELES: Megyn, the alleged cop killer, 32-year- old Tyrone Howard was thought to be involved last night in a gun battle in East Harlem. Thirty-three year old Officer Randolph Holder was among those who responded. Investigators say the suspect was riding his bike when he came across Officer Holder and his partner, and opened fire. Striking Holder in the forehead and killing him. The suspect then fled the scene and was arrested a short time later. He kept telling police his name was Juan Gonzalez, until facial recognize confirmed he was in fact Tyrone Howard, a career criminal who was supposed to be in prison. But a judge sent him to withdraw diversion program, instead. Today the judge defended that decision saying, quote, ""I don't get a crystal ball when I get this role. The defendant Howard at the time was 30-years-old. He had four felony drug convictions, no violence."" Except it turns Tyrone Howard had been arrested 28 times, jailed 12 times, not just for drugs, but also for assault and robbery, both violent offenses. And in 2009, he was arrested in connection with a shooting that injured three people including 7 and 11-year-old boys. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRATTON: If ever there was a candidate not to have been diverted, it would be this guy. He's a poster boy for not being diverted. So the district attorney's office will look into the circumstances of that diversion.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Tyrone Howard also failed to complete his drug diversion program, and was currently wanted on three warrants, including yet another shooting in September. Howard's attorney lobbied for his client to be sent to drug rehab saying, ""Prison would be hard on his two kids,"" not nearly as hard as it will now beyond Holder's wife and 16-year-old daughter -- Megyn?KELLY: Trace, thank you. And there are not only questions about this judge's decision, but the on-going reforms to the U.S. justice system, that are setting thousands of convicted criminals back onto the streets, programs that many of the presidential candidates now running, support. Mark Fuhrman is a Fox News contributor and former LAPD detective, Bernie Kerik is the former commissioner of the NYPD. Good to see you both, so.BERNIE KERIK, FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: Thank you.KELLY: Bernie, let me start with you. As somebody who is not only former commissioner, but full disclosure, spent some time in prison. You're in support of these reforms, to let some of these drug offenders out early and sort of give them a second chance, but you look at the situation that happened with Officer Holder, and you think is it such a good idea?KERIK: Well, here's the thing. One, I'm talking about first-time, non- violent offenders. I don't think they should go to prison. I don't think they may need prison. This is a very different story. This guy is 28 times arrested, and I know at the beginning of the segment, somebody said there was no violence -- or the judge said there was no violence. There actually was violence in the guy's background. There's no way.KELLY: Just arrests, though, not convictions for violent crimes.KERIK: But you know what, how many times have you have to be arrested? You know, I think the judge -- the diversion into a program, I think it was wrong. I think somebody should have been looking at this guy. And as the Commissioner Bratton has said today, what was he still doing on the street? You know, he was wanted for another shooting involve on the state.KELLY: They said they couldn't find him, Mark. They couldn't find the guy even though he was wanted for another shooting. And the Judge is now saying look. That the (inaudible) want it six years, but there was a letter from this guy's social worker and his child's mother, asking for special treatment saying, it would have been -- would make life tough for the young woman and her two kids if he wasn't put in this diversion program that allowed him to skip jail.MARK FUHRMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Megyn, when you really understand the career criminal, their whole life is about lying and manipulating the authorities to stay on the street. And the commissioner is absolutely correct. The drug diversion program, since they were started in the '70s, have been specifically targeting for the first time offender to keep them out of prison and get them rehabilitated and back into a livelihood, back into the mainstream. They're not for violent, career criminals. This judge is a fool. He's an idiot. He had a probation report. He had a rap sheet. He knew everything this man was involved in. And let me tell you, if you're arrested 28 times, you've committed 2 or 300 crimes to be able to get that lucky, to be actually arrest him 28 times.KELLY: You know the -- Commissioner, this murder underscores the danger that cops says everyday that is ignored by so many when they asses this situation to see on video.KERIK: And you know what? Nobody knows better than Mark. You know, I was with the chief of the LAPD today, the superintendent of Chicago, we're all here talking about reform issues. There are a hundred and thirty law enforcement leaders around the country, here in Washington D.C., talking about this, but the number one thing that came up in this meeting was the job that they have to do. The cops have to do on a daily basis. Go out and put their lives on the line. Go out and run into gunfire when others run away. And yet we still -- they still get criticized and they're still bashed, you know, by people out there, critics. It's a shame.KELLY: Yeah.KERIK: And this death is a shame.KELLY: Guys, thank you both so much. We appreciate seeing you.FUHRMAN: Thank you.KELLY: Up next, a day nearly 30 years in the making.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, the day ""Back to the Future"" fans have been waiting for has finally arrived. In the second installment, Marty McFly time travels to -- yes, October 21st, 2015. So how does a movie prediction of futuristic hoverboards held up against reality? Trace Gallagher knows. What's the story?GALLAGHER: The best way to do this -- well, the best way to do this, Megyn is it kind to give you a side by side look of the things Marty and Doc Brown came upon him their version of 2015 and the things that we truly have today, beginning with drones. In Back to the Future II, flying drones and everything from walk the dog to capture news video, our drones don't exactly walk dogs, but they are prevalent enough that laws can't keep up with them. The film predicted that in 2015, wireless devices could be used to pay for things like cab fare. They never dreamed of Uber, but the prediction of electronics payments was spot on. And remember Marty's future self getting fired during a video phone call? Now we have Facetime and Skype. The film also dreamed up future Facebook, where personal details, occupation and political leanings are all shared electronically. Then there are the video glasses. You know, where Marty and Jennifer's future kids ignore their families watching TV on those electronic glasses. Well, Google glass isn't exactly lighting the world on fire today, but they do exist. You can also make the argument that we kind of have self-lacing shoes because Nike is now working on perfecting them. And that we also have hoverboards, problem is, they're just called hoverboards. They don't exactly hover off the ground. They have wheels. And finally, the movie predicted that for the first time in 107 years, the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series in 2015. The Cubs still have a shot, but boy, it ain't looking good.(LAUGHTER)GALLAGHER: Megyn.KELLY: There's always hope. Trace, great to see you.GALLAGHER: Yeah.KELLY: We'll be right back with a question for you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: She's lying. She's absolutely lying.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Patricia Smith, the mother of Sean Smith, killed in Benghazi is our guest tomorrow night. Don't miss that. And here's a question for you. Do you believe the committee tomorrow will spend the day grandstanding or asking real questions to Mrs. Clinton? Let us know at facebook.com/thekellyfile or on Twitter @megynkelly.And in the meantime a follow to our Halloween story. Here are some apparently divisive moments from my own past. Here's my son. Here's my dog Basha, who was supposed to be a flapper, but some said she looked like a hooker. And there's yours truly with Hemmer back in the ""America's Newsroom"" days.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling, along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Over the last 24 hours have been wildly turbulence surrounding the democrats' running for president, Jim Webb dropped out of the race a couple of hours ago and Joe Biden has been making some serious waves for her majesty's ship, Hillary Clinton. Remember when Hillary Clinton was asked which enemy she was most proud of at the democratic debate?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Probably, the republicans.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Well, for whatever reason, Joe Biden seems to have a much different view of the GOP.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, UNITED STATES VICE PRESIDENT: Whenever there's a problem I get sent to the Hill.(LAUGHTER)BIDEN: Which by the way is a useful use of my time because I really respect the members of there and I still have a lot of republican friends. I don't think my chief enemy is the Republican Party.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: The VP also made clear that he, not the secretary of state, speaks for the president when he goes overseas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I will get sent to go speak to Putin or go speak to Erdogan or go speak to whomever, and it's because the secretary of state, we have two great secretaries of state, but when I go, they know that I am speaking for the president.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Well, finally, Clinton and Biden seem to have very different accounts of who supported the bin Laden raid.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: It was a really tough decision to advice on because, you know, we didn't -- we didn't have the smoking gun. I was one who recommended to the president that he go ahead. And his advisers were split.BIDEN: There were only two people who are definitive and there were absolutely, certainly Leon Panetta said go and Bob Gates has already -- public has said, they said don't go. I told them my opinion and I thought he should go, but to follow his own instincts.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And of course much has been written about Joe flip-flopping on that raid, but picture right there, the moment bin Laden was taken out. There's Biden on the left, flanked by President Obama, Hillary on the right, flanked by Robert Gates -- amazing photo. Kimberly, what's all this about? Biden seems to be contradicting everything that Hillary said in the last couple of weeks.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Uh-oh, she just got big footed. I like it. I think he's like being assertive. He's like, listen, I'm the big dog in the town. I'm the one that, you know, be -- you know, calling the shots, speaking for the president, being firm in my decision-making and say that he essentially supersedes her, I like this. That to me sounds like a man with confidence that knows what he wants and is ready to get in.BOLLING: Dana, in those three clips, Joe Biden said I get along with the GOP. I speak for the president when we go overseas or I go overseas, I'm sorry. And then the last one, I was in favor of the raid when a lot of people have said he never actually was.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: I think the most important one of those three is what he was saying about the republicans because this is a man who is now saying like, I'm ready to lead this party and not be the president of just the democrats, but the president of the entire nation. So he's saying, ""If your concern is that you think Washington can't get enough done, look to me because I'm the one who knows how to cut a deal."" And then the undercurrent is that what she said the other night is she chose to actually -- I think it's interesting that she said the Iranians might be on that list because actually, she's in favor of a deal that got them everything that they wanted. So to me, when she said the republicans, it was just so clear that she was trying to speak just to that audience right there, rather than realize that she had no competition on the stage and she just could have started running for the general election right there.BOLLING: Do you think it's a trial balloon? He puts out these fairly provocative comments to see what the media comes back with and come back with something.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: He keeps dropping hints. He's like a spouse whose birthday is coming up.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: And also, he's getting off, he's getting off on the attention. Biden's favorite topic, you know this, Juan, we've been around. His favorite topic is Biden. He loves talking about himself. And the good news, you know, he ran for president, I guess back in the '80s. The good thing about it is there are a whole new slew of speeches that he can plagiarize. So it will be fun. And I know that he is running because I've heard he constructed a greenhouse that's stocked row on row of hair plugs.GUILFOYLE: Oh, you're mean.GUTFELD: I am -- you know I'm tired of everybody saying, ""Oh, he's such a nice guy. He's a great guy."" Either run or don't run. Don't flirt with us. You know, and I get he's likable. I get that, but he's likable in a way that Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld was. He's kind of a walking misadventure.BOLLING: Wait, you want to weigh in on this, Juan?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Greg, you don't, you don't get the drift here today.GUTFELD: No, I don't.WILLIAMS: The drift is that republicans are worried about Hillary and celebrating the idea that somebody can come in and as Kimberly said, cause some turbulence for the great, you know, ship.GUILFOYLE: No, no. I actually.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Far prefer Joe Biden, and if the GOP drops the ball.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: I would rather see Joe Biden president.WILLIAMS: Well.GUILFOYLE: Than Hillary Clinton any day.WILLIAMS: Well, if you look at.GUILFOYLE: Because he respected the troops. He knows how to work across party-line. He's respected on the Hill.WILLIAMS: Well, let me just say.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: The gist.GUILFOYLE: So this is the gist.BOLLING: The gist was, for a long time, everyone has been looking at the fighting going on the republican side. It's kind of fun to sit back and watch it go on the other side.PERINO: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Well, no, that was.GUILFOYLE: That's Bolling.WILLIAMS: I was going to say to you is that there's so much dysfunction right now on the republican side. That I think republicans are like, hey, we want to see some of that on the democratic side and they hope that Joe Biden getting in would cause some trouble for Hillary. The problem with this theory is that the polls out today all show, Hillary getting a big bump out of the debate, right?BOLLING: Yup.WILLIAMS: And if you ask democrats, not republicans, but democrats, you only get 30 percent of them who say, ""Yeah, Joe Biden should run,"" in fact.BOLLING: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Nearly 40 percent say don't run.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: But he's not even started to campaign. And Juan, I actually think the analysis that you just put forth is not accurate. I think that the most republican strategists think that Biden would be harder to beat.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: In a general election than Hillary.GUILFOYLE: It's true.PERINO: I'm telling you that that's what.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: There's no poll that show that.PERINO: And I know you've been.GUILFOYLE: There are polls that show that.WILLIAMS: That shows that Joe Biden would be tougher to beat than Hillary?PERINO: I'm not talking about poll. I'm talking about just.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: No, the head to head? No, no, do you -- you should, we are, yes, yes. Joe Biden, out -- out performs Hillary Clinton, when you go head to head against every single republican.WILLIAMS: This is it. There might be.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: There might be some outliers.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: What do you talking about this?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: How come liberals aren't going after Biden as a misogynist, for attempting to block a woman.PERINO: Oh, they will.GUTFELD: From becoming the first.PERINO: They will.GUTFELD: Female president. Whereas you know the republicans are terrible.PERINO: They will.GUTFELD: Because they're going up against Biden.PERINO: Just wait. If she gets the announcement, they will do that.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: Within 48 hours.BOLLING: Well, let's move on today.PERINO: I think I might have seen that.BOLLING: What?PERINO: That's why I said 48 hours.BOLLING: Oh, less than 48 hours.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: In front of the House select committee on Benghazi, Senator McCain explains why this hearing is so important.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN MCCAIN, UNITED STATES SENATOR: I think that every major investigation that you and I have seen leads in different directions. Certainly, Watergate was a great example of that. I happen to be on a Sunday morning show right after the National Security Adviser Susan Rice talked about hateful videos and spontaneous demonstrations. And I said then, nobody brings the RPG and a mortar to a spontaneous demonstration. I was at Andrews and Hillary Clinton told the families, well we'll get these people that made this hateful video. By that time, it was obvious that there was no hateful video.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: The left thinks his hearings are political, but each time we learn new information on what happened in Benghazi and maybe more importantly, we learn what character, if any, makes up a presidential frontrunner. Quick around and Juan, your thoughts, this is -- I know Benghazi ain't, but every time we have more information.WILLIAMS: No, more information is legit. So at this point, you can say, well we didn't know about the e-mails and some of the secret accounts before. There's the potential for something there, we'll see if anything comes of it. The big news in Washington recently has been that Trey Gowdy, the Chair, thought he had something in terms of a CIA source being named turned out. The CIA didn't think it was confidential, so that's fine. I think the bigger issue here, speaking to Senator McCain, who's just a wonderful guy and I think, you know, legitimate in what his concerns are, is that there have been seven hearings, she's testified numerous times. There's been an independent authority report. So I think the bigger worry actually could be that Hillary Clinton uses the republicans and absolutely makes this into like Ollie North, who sat there and made them look like chumps?GUTFELD: Yeah. Yeah, maybe, but here -- we always have to go back to what is the logic behind pushing that video? Like, what were they were thinking. So it's always a walk through on the steps, especially for Juan. Since you know Juan is sometimes not here.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: Even when he's here.WILLIAMS: That's true.GUTFELD: For the logic of pushing the video to work. There has to be four steps -- five steps. One, some guy gets on YouTube, right? He wants -- he's looking for cat videos, he says I'm going to watch -- and then all of a sudden, he finds this weird, obscure video about Mohamed. And it's a coincidence that he found it on 9/11. On September 11th, it just happened to happen. And you know what he does? Normally, he was gonna go to work or his piano lessons, but he decides, no. You know what? I'm gonna call my friends. And they are -- they're all accountants and florists, but they go, yes, we're pissed off, too. So they all go out to a consulate, they burn it down and they kill four people. And then they go, you know what, let's go all back to work, to our jobs. And so they go back to their jobs and florists and accounts and they never do it again because they weren't terrorists.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: That's the logic that you need to believe Hillary Clinton.GUILFOYLE: That's it.GUTFELD: It's impossible.GUILFOYLE: Hungry for cat videos started it all.GUTFELD: Yes, exactly.GUILFOYLE: Interesting.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Did I just -- what you want (ph)?WILLIAMS: You know, but you know it's interesting to me. I sometimes -- because I am not here, you know.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Sometimes when I do focus and I focus on, I think, man, is he's from another planet?GUTFELD: Oh, thank you.WILLIAMS: Because you know the fact is.GUTFELD: I'm a brother from another planet.WILLIAMS: Take it out. I agree with that.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: But what I'm saying to you is, you know, guess what, there was a video and it did spark protest that everyone agrees.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I don't know how many people saw it.GUILFOYLE: Juan, you know this is not.WILLIAMS: But it's no question.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Let's get Dana here, weigh on the Benghazi.GUTFELD: Ghost created more outrage.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know.PERINO: OK. Well, I think that the most important thing that what John McCain is talking about is when there's a hearing like this, sometimes you find out something that you weren't even looking for. In this case, it is the fact that she had a private server at all. She's subsequently told several different stories, change in her stories that made her look like she was lying. And then over the summer because she couldn't get her story straight, she said, ""I'll come to that hearing and I will testify because she wanted to get it behind her. Now she doesn't want to go, but there's going to be a hearing, so she's gonna have to show up and answer the questions, but the number one thing that we learned is that there was a private server at all which was -- possibly, against the law, but absolutely against Obama administration guidelines.BOLLING: Policy, absolutely.PERINO: And she was the cabinet secretary.BOLLING: Hence the comment coming out of the last sound bite about character -- if any.President Bush, 43. Creating some news can self suggesting he doesn't like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio may not be ready for the presidency. Now Rubio for his part responded couple of minutes ago with Neil.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARCO RUBIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I don't even know if he said that -- number one. And number two, it sounds like him just telling a joke. It sounds like a funny thing to say.The press in general operates on conflict. I'm not running against anybody, I'm running for president.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Interesting -- interesting timing on the comments out of 43, though.PERINO: Well, I think that -- well he has said that he is for his brother, right? So there's been in advance and nobody necessary wants their private comments to be broadcast. But in today's day and age, that's what happens. So your public comments, and any -- even in a private setting have to be in direct proportion to how many people you think are going to tell somebody else about it. I would love to have Rubio handle that because he took it actually kind of as a compliment, made it a nice little moment and moved on to make his point of this is why I'm running for president and I thought he handled that perfectly and has really grown as a candidate.WILLIAMS: Oh you are a sweet person. You are.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Are you just a delight because how you cannot see that in fact, he went after Rubio, at Rubio's main point of vulnerability.PERINO: But don't you see that he -- didn't you see the follow up comment when he said, ""Of course, I could be wrong and next year I'll be back here telling you he was a perfect candidate.""WILLIAMS: Well, at that point you know.PERINO: That's why he was saying it was joke and that it was funny.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. And he's saying he's a party loyalist.PERINO: And he didn't take a stand which he doesn't -- he doesn't make himself a victim, which people like.BOLLING: So can I be a conspiracy theorist? Well, these comments are provocative and we're talking about it. What are we not talking about?PERINO: Oh my God, can we please.BOLLING: No, we are not talking about this thing that -- by the way, there was Jeb Bush was on Hannity last night, Donald Trump was on.PERINO: There we go. I knew it was coming.BOLLING: And it continued, but we're talking about something else. I would talk about.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I'm sorry.GUTFELD: I missed something because I wasn't here yesterday. What are you talking about?GUILFOYLE: You slept in.PERINO: Unbelievable.GUILFOYLE: We had a show, it was interesting.GUTFELD: Really?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: No wait. What are we talking about?BOLLING: It was a feud with the frontrunner, going in the guy with the most money in the race and those are things tend to be talked about.GUILFOYLE: They (inaudible) about 9/11.GUTFELD: Well, here's the issue, I guess -- we're talking about Donald Trump and 9/11. What's interesting is that he has managed to pull right- wingers even at Fox News into the same camp as left-wing haters. So there's almost no difference between people, some people at this table and Chris Matthews and Trevor Noah, who all agree that Bush is a bad guy. That is a major. That's a quite an achievement.WILLIAMS: Agree that Bush is a bad guy?GUTFELD: Yes. Because he knew, he knew that 9/11 was happening.WILLIAMS: Oh my, gosh. This is so absurd.GUTFELD: No, I'm mocking it.BOLLING: At this table, necessary.GUTFELD: I was.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: What would Greg think that you would think.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: I love the Bush family. I've got to tell you, I can't get enough. I hope more of them run. I'm looking forward to it.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Pierce Bush is gonna run in 2028.WILLIAMS: But wait, before we go. What about his comments about Cruz?GUILFOYLE: And George -- I don't know.BOLLING: Getting to know -- I'm not sure.PERINO: They probably.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Where is the point?PERINO: Look.GUILFOYLE: The comments are everybody knows.BOLLING: I don't like, though.GUILFOYLE: It's not a secret.BOLLING: But I don't like his policy.GUILFOYLE: It's not.BOLLING: I don't -- like where he is on.PERINO: Again.BOLLING: That.PERINO: And I thought Cruz -- and I -- you know what I think, Cruz handled that well too because he said look, I worked for him. I really respect and they provided my wife and I, an opportunity to actually meet -- we loved working for him and he didn't take the bait on it. But also, Ted Cruz has been running against the establishment for the whole time. It's one of the reasons -- it is actually probably helped him.WILLIAMS: This helped him, but Dana, the idea that -- he didn't say policy.PERINO: But I'm sure in public -- I mean, with his little base.WILLIAMS: But Dana, he didn't say policy. He is like -- it was like he said, ""I don't like that guy.""GUILFOYLE: Are you there, Juan?WILLIAMS: That's what he said?GUILFOYLE: I don't -- did he say it like that?WILLIAMS: Oh, in other words.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It's bold, it's refreshing.GUILFOYLE: How many people haven't heard you say that?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Bashing other people.PERINO: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Counter-punching.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: Bashing.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: Bashing. All right, let's leave it right there, directly ahead.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Have a question about the 2016 election? Tweet it to us @thefive, #thefive. Let's see your questions answered, coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Because I'm hung over, it's time now to answer -- might as well be honest.GUILFOYLE: It's honest, yeah.GUTFELD: We're going to answer some of your questions that you tweeted us about the 2016 election. I'm going to go to the first one. We'll go around the table to the lady in blue. Kimberly, because that's navy.GUILFOYLE: That's teal.GUTFELD: That's teal?GUILFOYLE: There.GUTFELD: All right, the segment is over. Let's.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Wilson asked. Is the weak democrat field intentionally crafted by the DNC, so HRC has an easy time?GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: Yes?(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: I mean of course, they don't want anybody good to run, OK? I mean no offense, look at poor Lincoln Chafee. Where is he now?GUTFELD: Oh, he's not too mowing my lawn.GUILFOYLE: What's going on, right?GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: That was weird.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: And poor Jim Webb was up there. And he dropped out. He was like, where am I? Who are these people on stage with.GUTFELD: Yes.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: It was like awkward.GUTFELD: Yes, that's true.GUILFOYLE: Right? Forget about it. Martin O'Malley is like, does anybody know my name? That was weird.GUTFELD: It was like Webb was on stage.GUILFOYLE: No.GUTFELD: With a folk band.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, so -- it's so crazy -- it's crazy. And there was like Hillary.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: And like the long pant suit situation -- and that was it. That was it. They don't want anyone else to show. That's what his saying Biden doesn't want to be bullied by the Clintons -- sorry, go ahead.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: That's my question.GUTFELD: So Juan. Is it -- what is like that? I mean, do you feel like it was like Gladys Knight and the Pipsqueaks?WILLIAMS: I thought she was the class of the field, there's any question. You know, I was kind of disappointed in fact, did you tell me you thought O'Malley might do better, or you just think you thought he was.PERINO: I didn't think -- I didn't think he was.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Because I did say that I thought he wasn't bad looking. But I also thought that he had a better debate than a lot of people gave him credit for.WILLIAMS: Oh, I don't think he had a good debate at all.GUTFELD: Oh yeah, yeah. He's a little too airbrushed for me -- Eric?GUILFOYLE: I mean, he's not bad looking.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Not on O'Malley, right?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: On Clinton?GUTFELD: On just anything.BOLLING: Here's what I think. I think Bernie Sanders showed the hand -- the democrat hand. First of all, DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, clearly wants Hillary. She's pushing Hillary, everything that Hillary wants. She gets everything she doesn't want, she doesn't get. Number of debates -- that's example. I think Bernie showed his hand, though, when he turns and said, enough of the e-mail stuff. He is the number two trying to get the nominations and lets her out of the most egregious thing, the thing that could really bring her candidacy down. They're looking like I'm crazy.WILLIAMS: Because it would bring her down among republicans.BOLLING: No, no.WILLIAMS: Democrats don't care.BOLLING: It would -- it could take her out of the race.GUTFELD: He's looking for job.WILLIAMS: Oh, if the FBI gets involved.BOLLING: Of course.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But if you're trying to appeal to democratic voters and you're Bernie Sanders, that -- in fact, Bernie Sanders did better, got more money after the debate for having done that.GUILFOYLE: No.PERINO: It was a mistake.GUILFOYLE: Juan, you're making this up. Where did you get that, like weird factoid? How are you correlating that his increase.WILLIAMS: He did raise a lot of money.GUTFELD: But wait. He did raise a lot of money. Why is he isn't spreading it around with the other candidates?GUILFOYLE: He did raise money like -- because people liked him. Not because they think he saved Hillary. If there's -- but Hillary, they gave money to her campaign.WILLIAMS: All I'm saying.GUTFELD: I said six questions here.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: You're moderating very well.GUTFELD: Thank you.BOLLING: We have 39 more minutes.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: That's good.WILLIAMS: And you're really wrong.GUTFELD: He's thought to talk about the Star Wars. You don't want to talk about answer this question?PERINO: Do I think it's a conspiracy? I don't. No, but I think they've been very strategic in figuring out a way to block out competition. But if a young Barack Obama type character would have came along, then she would have been beatable again. But there just isn't one.GUTFELD: You called them a character -- interesting.All right, question two. This is from Sherry09. Why don't they just let the top five republican's debate, considering the rest of them have such low percentage numbers? We'll go this way.PERINO: Well, we're going to get to that point.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: When -- just a little bit later on -- in the cycle.GUTFELD: Well, OK, very good.PERINO: It will narrow down.GUTFELD: Nice clip to answer.BOLLING: Good thing they didn't because Carly Fiorina, who had a fantastic debate performance at the junior table -- the happy hour table.GUTFELD: Right.BOLLING: Bumped herself up to the top five and got tied at one point. So (inaudible).GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: More than better and.PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: Eventually, he will get lift and drop out on their own.GUTFELD: But having said that, I've had ice cream headaches that lasted longer than her success. I mean she's definitely -- and I like her, but she's disappeared, Juan.BOLLING: You like anti-women or something?GUTFELD: Yes. I'm a misogynist nexus.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Well, you know, speaking.GUILFOYLE: I knew it.WILLIAMS: Speaking, as the only conservative at this table. I would say, let people debate. Let candidates run and don't have the establishment pick the candidates. And therefore, if people like a Carly Fiorina for a moment, let her have a surge. If it lasts, it lasts, but don't go around having the party picks the candidates.GUTFELD: Oh. Well, how about you?GUILFOYLE: Oh, except for the democrats.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Also, this is -- why this is important, because the standings have changed, right?GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Some people that were number one aren't now. You've seen people that were in maybe the top six, not be. So it's moving and it's fluid and eventually it will work itself out. Sort of like natural selection.GUTFELD: I just feel bad for the other ones. They're like wall flowers at a dance.GUILFOYLE: they don't feel that.GUTFELD: Everybody else is writing on the floor and.PERINO: Why do you ask them to dance?GUTFELD: I don't know. Let's go to the next question.GUILFOYLE: Because they're all taller than him.GUTFELD: All right.(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Holy smoked. What happened here?GUTFELD: That was bad (ph).(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I meant all about the ladies.GUTFELD: Yes. All right, all right.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: All right, lady tanner.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: OK. Question.GUILFOYLE: I know you're gorgeous, are they right?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Frances Powers asked. How would you talk to young voters, like myself, about why they should vote for the GOP? Eric.BOLLING: It's very simple. Just go to the tax rates. Just go what the democrats are proposing. Bernie Sanders wants to tax you up to 90 percent of your incomes. Republicans are for smaller government, lower taxes. If nothing else, if do you have a job, you want a republican.WILLIAMS: What?GUTFELD: Juan. OK you can answer, Juan.WILLIAMS: Well, I love arguing with Eric, but I'm not going to argue with you at this moment. Because I'll say this, my son -- I have a son who is a republican -- I have two actually, but.GUTFELD: They're both republicans, aren't they?WILLIAMS: Yes, but the one that works for the republicans, always intriguing a conversation because he says he's a republican because -- you know what, he believes in opportunity, self-reliance.GUTFELD: Right. There you go.GUILFOYLE: See.WILLIAMS: You know what? He's the kind of guy that believes in small government getting out of his way.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: And letting him do it. And he's this -- I mean, this is -- and he's a family values guy.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: And that's why he's a republican. So if you're a young person, I think that's a good wrap. I mean, I think that' what I would listen.GUTFELD: Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: I think you should listen to your son.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Well, thank you.PERINO: Well done, you Juan.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: . free market, opportunity, self-reliance.WILLIAMS: You know I'm like -- you know me, I'm a party guy.GUILFOYLE: He just wants some free stuff baby. That's what Juan wants.WILLIAMS: Oh no, no, no. No, you see, but you -- then you run into republicans who are like militaristic, let's go in, everybody's got the kill the immigrants, you know.GUILFOYLE: What are you talking about?WILLIAMS: How about.GUTFELD: Yes. That's the republicans.WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.GUTFELD: Kill the immigrants.WILLIAMS: How about a fear fest (ph). You should be afraid right now.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUTFELD: That will be the immigrants.WILLIAMS: That's (inaudible). That's what the true feeling is.GUILFOYLE: He is just hungry. He didn't eat yet.WILLIAMS: I thought he was hung over.GUTFELD: What would you say.PERINO: I think if you care about economic and individual liberty that the Republican Party has a better solution for you. And if you look at the places where you might want to live, the places that are doing the best with the lowest unemployment rate, the most bang for your buck and the safest nation in the world, you should want to go for a republican.GUTFELD: Excellent. I would say identity politics only creates jobs for people who work in identity politics.All right.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Not bad.GUTFELD: Up next. The NRA -- never heard of them, launch as compelling new ad about minorities in poor communities arming themselves. Will it make liberals switch gears on gun control? Details, when we return.GUILFOYLE: OK.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Well, the NRA has launched a powerful new ad campaign about guns in America. It features an African-American woman named Josephine Bird who explains why she and other minorities living in dangerous neighborhoods should have the right to arm and protect themselves when the police cannot. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSEPHINE BIRD, NRA MEMBER: I can't afford a nice house in a safe neighborhood. I live in a government high-rise. Gangbangers and drug dealers walk down our halls every day.My neighbors and I were scared. We called the police. But they can't keep us safe. The housing authority told me, if I bought a gun, to protect myself, they'd throw me to the streets. If I'm not free because of my address today, what makes you think you'll be free tomorrow?I marched behind Martin Luther King Jr. at Selma, I know my rights. Now I have my gun. I am the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: And it isn't just Josephine Bird, either. A recent Pew poll found that 54 percent of African-Americans believe owning a gun does more to protect them than pose a risk. So should this ad make anti-gun liberals rethink their position on gun control?That is a powerful video and message.GUTFELD: Me?GUILFOYLE: You're up.GUTFELD: Do you think there would have been looting in Ferguson if every shopkeeper had a boom stick instead of a broomstick? There wouldn't have - - they would have found another way to express themselves.If you're against this woman, you are a racist and a sexist; and I'll -- let's tackle the sexist part first. Men have 50 percent more muscle mass, so a gun is a force equalizer. The gun is the best rape whistle you can have. It makes -- it makes the weakest woman equal to the strongest thug.You're racist, because you're depriving people that live in, as she says, crime-ridden areas from protecting themselves. So if you don't want her to have a gun -- and that is white privilege. All those white gun control advocates who live in the suburbs, they have suburban white privilege. They believe nobody should have guns, including this poor lady.GUILFOYLE: The same people who have the ocean privilege -- Bolling.BOLLING: So 2008, Supreme Court reaffirmed our right to protect our homes with a firearm. But the problem is only 31 percent of homes have a firearm right now. Twenty-five percent of homes have a security system. But this, this number, 1.5 million burglaries per year. Per year. Seventy-three percent of those happening in private homes.Increase the number of homes with a firearm, drop the number of burglaries, it's common sense.WILLIAMS: Yes. OK, so can I take a turn?GUILFOYLE: Please.GUTFELD: No!WILLIAMS: Yes, I know, because I'm not here. Anyway, because what we have is the minute that you have a gun in the home, you increase your chances of being killed 40 percent.GUTFELD: You're talking suicide.WILLIAMS: No, no, no, I'm talking suicide and accidents.GUTFELD: You also increase your risk of a car accident if you own a car.WILLIAMS: No. But that's ridiculous.GUTFELD: No, it's a fact. You're more likely to be in a car accident if you're in a car than if you're not in a car.WILLIAMS: You need a car to go places. Anyway, let me finish my point.GUTFELD: But you can get in an accident in a car.GUILFOYLE: Or a plane crash.WILLIAMS: You were talking about a moment ago about race, and here's my feeling about this.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Fifty-five percent of gun homicide victims are black people. Only 13 percent of the population, 55 percent of the victims. Which is why you think, gee, I wonder why, you know, urban blacks, including -- unlike this lady or the man, another Chicagoan who was in the Supreme Court suit who said, ""I want the right to a gun because of these gang-bangers in the neighborhood."" You wonder why.A high percentage of black people not only are dying from these guns, but know people who have died...GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: ... as a result of gunshots. And guns are a real threat in poor communities.GUTFELD: Which is why they should have guns to protect themselves from the assailants, because you left out who the assailants are.WILLIAMS: Who the assailants -- the shooters...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: If you say the law-abiding person cannot have the gun, even though you cannot control the guns that are in the arms of the gangs, you are actually creating more victims.WILLIAMS: I don't understand it.BOLLING: The bad guys are going to get the guns, anyway. You don't take the guns out of the good guys' hands.WILLIAMS: Oh so, in other words you guys are in line...GUILFOYLE: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) that Juan does.WILLIAMS: You guys therefore think, ""You know what? We shouldn't do anything except bring more guns in""?GUTFELD: OK.GUILFOYLE: Yes. All right, fine.WILLIAMS: You see, that's what I...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: No, no, what I'm saying is everybody has the right to protect themselves. And the woman made a very important point. You can't rely on the police to get there when you're being attacked. They only come after the crime. She's got to protect herself in a high-crime area.BOLLING: The town of (UNINTELLIGIBLE) required households to have a firearm. Crime plummeted in that town.GUILFOYLE: Dana Perino, my friend.PERINO: OK, I know we only have 10 seconds left. So let me just say, I'm going to talk about it from a communications standpoint. About the ad, is it persuasive? Could it change minds? It's possible.And one of the things that I was thinking about when I watched the ad was something I read in Greg's book when he talks about being persuasively correct. Which is you can use liberals' language...GUTFELD: Against them.PERINO: ... against them.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: But you can also do that through the form of video and photographs. OK, so when you see her, are you drawn, at least, to it?These made me think that there could be some common ground. And I think the element of surprise actually works well for this particular ad in this case.GUILFOYLE: I think so, too. I think it was effective, and I liked it. Think outside the box.When we come back, blocked by Democrats, the death of Kate Steinle by the hands of an illegal immigrant in the sanctuary city of San Francisco apparently had no impact on Senate Democrats. We're going to tell you about the important legislation they just railroaded, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Earlier today, Senate Democrats successfully blocked a Republican bill that would crack down on sanctuary cities. By a vote of 54-45, the measure fell short of reaching the 60-vote threshold the same day the White House issued a veto threat and Harry Reid labeled the bill ""vile legislation.""The Stop Sanctuary Cities Act would threaten to withhold funds from local governments that don't cooperate with federal immigration officials. The bill's consideration came months after the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant.And Eric, this was not necessarily a surprise, because the Democrats had made a decision early on that they knew that they had the backing of the White House to vote against this bill.BOLLING: Right. So they needed 60 votes. They got two Democrats to come over and vote for it. One Republican voted against it.Rand Paul made a very good point to help understand what goes on here. If someone is convicted if a state, say Illinois, and is serving time for his conviction is Illinois, but has committed a murder in Kentucky and is also has convicted there, when he finishes his term, his sentence in Illinois, he gets exported to Kentucky, immediately transported and goes to jail in Kentucky.PERINO: Right.BOLLING: What happens here is what sanctuary cities do is, when you've done something wrong and you either let go or you've done your time in a sanctuary city, they don't make you go pay for your crime of either being here illegally or whatever felonies you've committed while being here illegally, on the federal level. They say, ""You're done. We're going to let you go. We're not going to tell the feds."" There's no communication. They've got to fix that. They have to fix it.PERINO: And not allowing sanctuary cities to run like this, I think that, actually, that is common sense.But Juan, to show you how political this has gotten and Harry Reid and the Democrats must have done their homework, because they know that this works for them or they wouldn't have said this. Not only did he say it was vile legislation. He said it could be called the Donald Trump Act. So now politics is now fully engaged on the immigration debate. We can't even solve something like sanctuary cities.WILLIAMS: I agree. You know, this is the sad part. I mean, there should be some rationality applied here, that there are steps that should be taken, as you were saying.I would say the No. 1 step is, if the federal government says, you know, ""This is a dangerous person,"" not some low-level marijuana crime, which is what the guy was in jail for, after having done it five times or whatever, issue the warrants, stop with the detainees. A warrant, the locals will respond. But the detaining -- they don't react to that because of the sanctuary city legislation.But no matter what the legislation, two points, we should fix this. There shouldn't be such a loophole. And two, you know at this network that we've been pushing -- or O'Reilly has been pushing the idea that, if you commit a crime and you're here illegally, another five years. Try to up the punishment.PERINO: Mandatory minimum.GUILFOYLE: Well, doesn't that make sense, to operate as a deterrent? People should be punished for breaking the law repeatedly?WILLIAMS: That's what I said. I just said that.GUILFOYLE: Yes, right, that's what I'm saying. So I think that makes a lot of sense.What bothers me is when you see partisan politics like this. No matter how many American lives it might cost, they're still going to vote their ideology first instead of doing the right thing. So you see people like Harry Reid using this, like, you know, crazy rhetoric.WILLIAMS: No, no, no.GUILFOYLE: Trying to call it the Donald Trump, you know, law.PERINO: Apparently, the Koch brothers are not on his list anymore, so he's gone over to Donald Trump.WILLIAMS: Wait. I was just going to make a quick point. Yes, but shouldn't we say that -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.PERINO: I just want to ask you if you think -- we only have a second left. Can either side win here and be correct? And persuade people that they're right?GUTFELD: Actually, I have an idea. I -- because this is setting a precedent. It's essentially endorsing criminality, saying -- allowing sanctuary cities to exist. I think it is time for conservatives to create their own sanctuary cities. Where any -- choose a certain location, where every law-abiding gun owner can carry in public.Or perhaps create a city, a sanctuary city, where you can smoke anywhere you want. You can smoke in bars; you can smoke in taverns. Or maybe we could have a city, no speed limits.Each one of these examples is breaking the law, but we have a precedent here, it is OK to break the law. So let's do it. I want to see the first nude village.PERINO: Do you really want to see that?GUTFELD: Milpitas, California. I dare Milpitas, California to go nude.Seriously, this is absurd. Why can't -- why do we need to have laws?GUILFOYLE: Bolling.BOLLING: Did you buy, like, property in Milpitas?GUTFELD: I just like the name Milpitas.GUILFOYLE: Bolling wants to go. He's really taken.BOLLING: I really don't.PERINO: I actually kind of like that idea.GUTFELD: It's absurd.GUILFOYLE: Dana, you want to go to the nudists?PERINO: No, not the nude city. No. I like the idea of conservative sanctuary cities.GUTFELD: Yes, conservative sanctuary cities. One is called Dallas.WILLIAMS: No, wait a second. You know -- you know that old Eddie Murphy. I didn't know conservatives were partying like this.GUTFELD: They are.WILLIAMS: I had no idea.PERINO: Juan, there's so many things you don't know about conservatives.GUILFOYLE: One more reason, Juan.PERINO: We will educate you in the commercial break.GUTFELD: Talk to your sons.PERINO: All right. Coming up, ""Star Wars"" mania kicks into high gear after the release of the newest movie trailer. Get ready, Jedi fans. ""The Force Awakens,"" and the preview is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS (WEARING A DARTH VADER MASK): Legions of fans are going wild after the new ""Star Wars"" movie trailer debuted during halftime of ""Monday Night Football."" Behold ""The Force Awakens.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There are stories about what happened.HARRISON FORD, ACTOR: It's true. All of it.The dark side. The Jedi. They're real.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The force, it's calling to you.Just let it in.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: The seventh film in the ""Star Wars"" franchise is one of the most highly anticipated movies in recent memory. In fact, when advanced tickets went on sale, websites crashed -- kaboom -- across the board. And get this: online -- online ticket service Fandango, they reported they've already sold eight times as many tickets as they did for ""The Hunger Games,"" the previous record holder, for the first day of ticket sales.GUILFOYLE: Press the button.WILLIAMS: Press the button. Here's the button.GUILFOYLE: I like the talking.WILLIAMS: (BREATHING SOUNDS)PERINO: Very good, Juan.WILLIAMS: You know what I think? I think I'm Eric's dad. I'm your dad, Eric.BOLLING: So yes, eight times. They're destroying records. Now I didn't have any talking points, because I really have never seen a ""Star Wars"" movie.WILLIAMS (AFTER REMOVING MASK): Come on, you've never seen a ""Star Wars"" movie?BOLLING: Never seen it, so I call up -- I go...WILLIAMS: How is that possible?BOLLING: Nate Freden (ph) and Ron Mitchell, I said, ""Guys, I need something smart to say, because I really don't know what I'm talking about.""Like, ""Bolling, don't worry. We got this. You don't want to dis 'Star Wars.' It's huge."" He said, ""Just ask, since Leonard Nimoy is dead, who's going to play Spock in the new movie."" So do we know?GUILFOYLE: Wow, that was pretty unbelievable.GUTFELD: Juan.BOLLING: He's not in it.GUILFOYLE: Yes, no kidding, that's ""Star Trek.""GUTFELD: We know.PERINO: Got it.GUILFOYLE: I mean, somebody help me. Bring me back the Darth Vader mask.GUTFELD: You know what's interesting about ""Star Wars""?BOLLING: What?GUTFELD: It leaves -- it gives you a glimpse into human nature. It's called ""Star Wars."" It's not called ""Star Peace."" There's no room for pacifists in outer space. Pacifists cause war because of their inaction. We love ""Star Wars,"" not star peace.WILLIAMS: It's true.GUTFELD: Thank you.WILLIAMS: Thank you. It's true.And let me just tell you something, you see these...BOLLING: Sabers.WILLIAMS: ... light sabers?BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: They are so popular.

You like a Princess Leia vibe?WILLIAMS (PUTTING DARTH VADER MASK BACK ON): Do you think I look more threatening and masculine?GUILFOYLE: I think you're sexy.WILLIAMS: You do?GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: You know why?

You people are disgusting. What has happened to this show?GUILFOYLE: It's time for a tasty snack and some Fandango tickets.PERINO: Yes. I got the red one, of course, notice.I love it, because the good guys always win.WILLIAMS: The good guys always win.PERINO: Yes, and America could use a win right now. So this is fun. I think it's fun.I remember when I was, I think, eight or nine. My mom and dad took my sister and I to Century 21 in Denver. You all know it? Huge movie theater. And that was my first exposure to it, and I loved it. But now I actually have to say, it makes me -- I get too nervous in a suspenseful movie.BOLLING: This movie is going to, like, blow numbers. What they're saying, 600 million bucks right off the bat. A billion dollars.GUILFOYLE: You better go. It's far better than all those zombie movies.WILLIAMS: Hey, Greg, I can't -- In fact, picking up on Eric's point, I thought you would object to this whole segment and say we're just advertising a stupid movie.GUTFELD: No, I'm a big fan of ""Star Wars.""PERINO: He likes it.GUTFELD: I enjoy it.PERINO: He's a big fan of wars.GUTFELD: I just like war.WILLIAMS: I forgot.

I'll go first. Listen, I don't love his politics, but you've got to give the man extra points in his guts cards for doing this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARTIN O'MALLEY (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (singing): Because baby now we got bad blood. You know, it used to be mad blood. So take a look at what you've done and maybe now we got bad blood. Hey!(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: The president thing doesn't work out for O'Malley, maybe there's a future there.Dana, you're up.PERINO: That takes guts.All right. Check out this organization. It used to be called Soldier Socks, which started as a goal of trying to get socks and supplies to soldiers that are on the front lines. Now they're called Soldier Strong. They just changed their name, and it reflects how their work has helped vets get back on their feet with some state-of-the-art medical devices. Our own Martha McCallum is on the board of Soldier Strong, and this morning the co-founder, Chris Meeks, was on ""FOX and Friends."" Check out what this Navy veteran, Jason Geiser, says that Soldier Strong has done for him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JASON GEISER, NAVY VETERAN: When you're a veteran, you have a sense of independence and a sense of the fight and you're right. And then once you lose your mobility, it takes something away from you. And for companies like Soldier Socks to develop something and get veterans back on their feet, it gives us our independence back and a sense of strength.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: It's really amazing what the technology has been able to advance. It's like -- it's like robotics. Check them out at SoldierStrong.org.GUILFOYLE: Very nice.BOLLING: Great one. Greg, you're up.GUTFELD: All right.

So I was at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, with the -- I spoke to the lovely college Republicans. Here's the group that...GUILFOYLE: Where are you?GUTFELD: ... Frank Pray (ph). I'm in the middle there. This is a collection of khakis that we call the collection, the College Republicans. I spoke to them.I want to thank them and Emily Henseler (ph), who's the executive director of Liberty U.'s YAF, and Emily Weeks, who is executive vice chair of the UNC College Republicans. They're all good people.I was there to promote or actually sell my book, which you can order anywhere. It tells you how to be right. It's good for kids, because it's really small. It can fit in a pocket, almost. If you have a really big pocket.GUILFOYLE: I like that.BOLLING: All right. Juan, you're up.WILLIAMS: So Oprah Winfrey is fattening up Weight Watchers, at least their stock value. The sales were down, the profits were off 50 percent for the first half of the year.But now she has said that she's going to buy 10 percent of the stock and guess what? The company's value soared with that news. She's also joining the board and potentially will get to buy 5 percent more, because she was options. So in the last few days, guess what? Oprah Winfrey made $72 million. She is doing very well and definitely on a good financial diet.BOLLING: And she'll pay $14 million in federal tax and get this: she's going to pay $3 million in Obamacare tax.GUILFOYLE: Will you let the lady speak?GUILFOYLE: Yes. OK, so I have a very nice ""One More Thing."" Just want to wish -- there he is -- President Bush 41 well. This is a new photo of the president, showing him without his neck brace for the first time in months. You remember that he broke a vertebrae in his neck after a fall in his home back in July. And now he is braceless, so happy for him and the family.BOLLING: Absolutely. I've got to leave it right there. Bye.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARTIN O'MALLEY, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I mean, what have we come to as a party that we are so poor that we can't afford to have more than one debate in Iowa and one debate in New Hampshire before the primary? It's outrageous. And people in our own party aren't going to stand for this sort of meddling and limiting of debate that the DNC is trying to engage in. I should say some in the DNC. I think most DNC members also think this is a really, really bad idea.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Martin O'Malley talking about debates, the lack of them on the Democratic side, as we get more talk about Vice President Biden getting in this race, and a new poll out of New Hampshire from PPP, the Democratic- leaning polling organization, that has Bernie Sanders up seven points on Hillary Clinton. This comes after a different poll, ""The Boston Herald,"" poll had him up six.We'll start with the Democrats and bring in our panel, syndicated columnist George Will, Julie Pace, White House correspondent for the Associated Press, and editor in chief of LifeZette, Laura Ingraham. OK, Laura, Democrats in turmoil, what about this?LAURA INGRAHAM, LIFEZETTE.COM: I think this Hillary Clinton free fall is just, I didn't predict it. I think the Clintons are like, sorry, the cockroaches after a nuclear holocaust. They always survive no matter what the scandal is. They can figure out a way around it.Now you get this sense the opinion about all this is solidifying. And serious people of serious mind sets are basically saying, as Mike Mukasey, former attorney general, said on my radio show today, she's in serious jeopardy, legal jeopardy on anticipatory obstruction of justice. You don't just have destroyed evidence in an investigation. If you anticipate that there could be an investigation down the road and you destroy evidence, you put yourself in big legal jeopardy. I think this is serious and I think the voters are now getting that maybe the next Clinton term isn't going to happen after all.BAIER: After the White House yesterday, Julie, came out so forcefully for Vice President Biden, it seemed to change the dynamic a little bit, the tone.JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: It was pretty fascinating because we've had these questions come up at the White House briefing for several months now. It wasn't the first time they had been asked about Vice President Biden considering running for president. And you almost expected them to be more muted in their response. Instead you had this very forceful not quite endorsement, but very forceful comments that were favorable for Joe Biden. I think the fact the press secretary said the president could endorse in the Democratic Party didn't sit well with people in the Clinton camp. They have cleared the way for Joe Biden to run if he wants to, certainly.BAIER: George, take a listen to John Podesta responding to a question on PBS about possibly Vice President Biden getting in.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN PODESTA, CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN: If he does run, we will -- that will be a good debate inside the party. But I think that he's going to make that personal decision himself. But the reason I support Hillary is because I think she's the best person, most able to do the job. I have tremendous admiration for him, but it's a personal decision about do you want to get out there, offer yourself up, take the knocks. They're always coming. Whoever the nominee is, eventually they get around to you.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So the Clinton people saying the knocks are coming. If he gets in they're coming.GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: It sounds as though they think it's more than just possible but probable at this point.You showed the poll with Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is fun, particularly if you're in politics, as activists are, for the fun of it. And ""fun"" is not the word that springs to mind when you look at the Clinton campaign, a kind of plodding, sullen, joyless pursuit of joy. And at this point, he, Bernie Sanders, could be what Gene McCarthy was to Lyndon Johnson. He demonstrated Lyndon Johnson's vulnerability in the New Hampshire primary. And Bobby Kennedy said, oh, come to think about it, I might do this instead.It's particularly damaging and threatening, I think, to Mrs. Clinton because Biden contrasts so vividly with her. He is ebullient. He is happy. He's a cheerful, happy warrior. And he's fun. And the contrast is deadly.BAIER: George, a lot of people on the Republican side say a certain candidate is fun, Donald Trump. South Carolina, Monmouth poll has come out, 30 percent for Donald Trump, Ben Carson 15 percent, Jeb Bush nine percent. You can see the rest out of South Carolina. Look at Lindsey Graham at four percent, his home state. Look at PPP in New Hampshire, again that same Democratic-leaning poll. But Donald Trump at 35 percent. Now, there are some people obviously according to these polls who think Donald Trump is fun.WILL: I think he is fun for a lot of people because he's naughty, and there are no consequences to anything he says. And he'll say anything.I would point out with regard to poll numbers, in June, 1992, five months before the election, the year advanced from where we are, the Gallup poll showed Bill Clinton at 25 percent, the incumbent president of the United States George Herbert Walker Bush at 31 percent, and at 39 percent, leading the field easily, was Ross Perot. Then the serious moment came around when the American people said we're not sending a message to Washington, we're sending a president, and Perot evaporated.BAIER: Laura?INGRAHAM: He still got 18 percent of the vote.WILL: And zero electoral votes.INGRAHAM: Right. But Republicans also lost the election, obviously, so that was devastating.I wonder what would this race look like if Jeb Bush weren't in the race, because I think right now it's like a death match between Bush and Trump.  BAIER: Every day it's this antagonist going back and forth.  INGRAHAM: Yes, the back and forth. And I think a lot of these other candidates who are strong, have current relevance to the fights of the day, the struggles of the day for conservatives especially, and yet they're really not getting all that much oxygen here.  So there have been a lot of people writing Trump should drop out. He's not going to drop out. He's already said that, in the polls, he's not going to drop out. But you look at a guy who has $120 million, and Jeb Bush is a really nice person. I think he was a really strong governor at Florida. But that was a long time ago.  And Chris Christie came on my radio show today, and he said he's not relevant to today, about Bush. Now, you think of someone like a Walker or a Christie or a Kasich or even Rubio or Cruz, they've really been in the struggles. Jeb hasn't been. And these problems down at the border yesterday, the New York Times said in a span of 15 minutes he offended Asians, conservatives, helped Trump, and really seriously hurt his campaign. That's quite an accomplishment for 15 minutes at the border. But at least he spoke Spanish.BAIER: We talk about, Julie, the Clinton campaign sputtering. Is the Bush campaign sputtering?PACE: It's having a difficult summer. I mean, to Laura's point, what you saw at the border with Jeb Bush was problematic on a lot of levels. He's pitching himself as a candidate who is steep in policy, wants to talk about nuanced policy. He went to the border to talk about immigration. I don't think there was much coverage of his actual immigration policies so he lost that moment.He thinks now that by going after Trump, getting into these head-to- head battles that he's going to be the one that's going to out Trump for what he really is. That doesn't seem to be working at this point. And the anchor babies comment, when he brought Asians into the equation, I think it was just befuddling to a lot of people. It didn't really make a lot of sense why he felt the need to volunteer that. So I think --BAIER: I think he's filled with a lot of stats. I think the numbers are 60,000 Asians come over to have babies.PACE: But when you're trying to move the conversation toward you actual what you say is the nuanced policy, that's probably not the best way to do it.BAIER: Last word.WILL: We don't do nuance at this time of year in this country.BAIER: It's summer.WILL: That's right.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.
