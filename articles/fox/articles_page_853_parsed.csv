This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On the Buzz Meter this Sunday, the media bashing Jeb Bush for part of his response to the horrifying campus shootings in Oregon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEB BUSH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Stuff happens. There's always a crisis. The impulse is always to do something, and it's not necessarily the right thing to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: But his campaign accuses the press of dishonest distortion. Is that true?Vladimir Putin's air in Syria strikes trigger an international crisis and roils the presidential campaign. But has the media blamed President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are they also pressing the Republicans for answers?Rand Paul being written off by many pundits hits back at Ted Cruz, at Donald Trump, and at the media for downgrading his chances.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAND PAUL, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the rumors of my demise are somewhat exaggerated, to say the least.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: My sit-down with the Senator on whether he can revive his struggling Presidential campaign.Robert Redford coming out with a new movie sympathetic to Dan Rather and his discredited story about George W. Bush and the National Guard.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT REDFORD AS DAN RATHER: Tonight, we have new information on the president's military service.Here's to a great story.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Will the film gloss over the massive mistakes made by Rather and CBS?Plus, Hillary Clinton does ""Saturday Night Live.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm just an ordinary citizen who believes the Keystone pipeline will destroy our environment.(LAUGHTER)KATE MCKINNON AS HILLARY CLINTON: I agree with you there. It did take me a long time to decide that, but I am against it.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: You know, there's nothing wrong with taking your time.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Will that help her shake off all the bad press? I'm Howard Kurtz, and this is ""MediaBuzz.""Jeb Bush is hitting back hard at the media after a reporter asked him to respond to the college massacre in Oregon that prompted President Obama to renew his call for tighter gun control. Here's the fuller context of what the Former Florida Governor said and how some media outlets are seizing on just two words.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BUSH: It's very sad to see, but I resist the notion -- and I had this challenge as Governor, because we had -- look, stuff happens, there's always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something, and it's not necessarily the right thing to do.CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC: For the second time in two days, the President goes all in on gun safety, as Jeb Bush shrugs his shoulders.DAVID CORN, MSNBC: They have nothing to say. That's why I think Bush made -- basically told us what they really think. This is the price of doing business. Stuff happens, get used to it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The Bush campaign announcing this, it is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats aided and abetted by some of the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush's comments out of context. Joining us now Chris Stirewalt, Fox News Digital Politics Editor, Carol Lee, White House Correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, and Joe Trippi, a Democratic Strategist and Fox News Contributor, Chris, is Jeb Bush right, that this was a media distortion?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Yes and no. Taken in the larger context, yes, even the other comments outside of what we just heard, where obviously he is being sympathetic, and then he's trying to shorthand at the end. It was a mistake...KURTZ: It was a mistake -- I've watched this thing five times. Even in the full context it comes off as a little tone deaf.STIREWALT: Shorthand when -- and this is an issue that for Bush is not just a problem for a potential general electorate, but also -- because Republicans are concerned about the persecution of Christians, since that is attached to this and the idea of martyrdom, Bush should have been kinder.KURTZ: Carol, this reminds me of a long list of examples of politicians who complain media take them out of context when they said something that boomeranged on them.LEE: It reminded me of when President Obama during the 2012 election said if you have a business, you didn't build that. And Republicans seized on that, and the job of the media is to put it into context and to you know, not just use the one clip or a phrase, but to explain more broadly. But Jeb Bush has this problem. He said the phrase earlier about how people need to work longer hours. That was also taken out of context. And gives his position in this race, he can't afford these mistakes.KURTZ: And Mitt Romney did this a lot. Now the newspapers have given the full count. Some TV folks have made it more concise, but Joe Trippi, Jeb Bush is entitled to his view that new gun control laws aren't need or wouldn't be effective. Most Republican candidates agree with that, but is this a sad and craven act by the media, as he says?JOE TRIPPI, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: No, look, you cannot say things like this, and then -- it's like gambling in the casino. If you can't make the mistake and sort of serve that up and not expect your opponents and the press and, by the way, social media to go crazy with it, I saw this, I tweeted immediately I think stuff happens is going to trend. I was wrong about that. It went everywhere. Now you've got social media driving that, you know, that it was tone-deaf or whatever, and now he's stuck in it. And you're right, it's happened over and over again with Jeb Bush. I think he's really hurt his candidacy, because he's not careful about the language he's using.On the other hand, we're in a year where people don't want anybody to be careful about the language. Had Trump said something like this, very interesting, would the media -- I'm sure the media would have jumped all over it, and his opponents, but I think...KURTZ: Coverage would have been to laugh it off.TRIPPI: Yeah.KURTZ: All right. Russia stunning the United States and the world by beginning air strikes in Syria, supposedly -- let me give you just a little sample of the sort of polarizing commentary we've had on both of left and the right.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS: When Bashir Al Assad crossed that line, the president did nothing. No wonder Vladimir Putin and others feel like they can walk all over the United States.HAYES: Vladimir Putin justified today his military actions saying, ""The only way to fight international terrorism is to act preventively,"" sounds oddly familiar. No wonder conservatives in America can barely disguise their jealous admiration Putin's strong man routine.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Chris?STIREWALT: That's awesome. I would guess I would say when the chief spokesperson for the White House said that the Russians will be no more successful with the military solution in Syria than we were in Iraq, we sort of have reached peak stupidity on foreign policy. We have reached a space where every foreign policy question has to be relentlessly politicized, has to be ground down into nothing.KURTZ: There's a lot of criticism of President Obama, understandably so, but are journalists also pressing the Republicans on what they would do instead?STIREWALT: Certainly it's appropriate they should, and certainly been a problem for Trump, certainly been a problem for Jeb Bush. It's been to the advantage of others. What I'm saying is when you talk about that kind of horse hockey, or you have the chief spokesman for the White House defending themselves on the ground of Bush lost a war, or we lost a war or whatever, we're in a real garbage space.KURTZ: Journalists tend to have short memories. And I don't see a lot of reporters pointing out that just a couple years ago that Obama was moving towards air strikes in Syria after the Syrian regime used chemical weapons. There was very little support in Congress, especially among Republicans, for military action.LEE: There was very little support and the White House knew that and they knew they weren't going to win on that.KURTZ: So they negotiated a solution with Assad.LEE: What he was looking to do at the time was a very specific thing, which is go after the chemical weapons, not -- you know, try to change -- solve the civil war in Syria through air strikes. Now what you've seen is the dynamics have significantly shifted. You have the Islamic state taking over vast parts of Syria. Russia is now moving in. There are complete failures of different aspects of the administration's strategy. All of this is happening around the same time, and I think the press coverage has been pretty consistent in the sense that the narrative is that the President is being dragged into something that he reluctantly doesn't want to do, and that's -- you're seeing that continue.KURTZ: Here's what strikes me. I don't see liberal commentators, Joe, defending President Obama on this. They're criticizing the Republicans or changing the subject to Bush's invasion of Iraq.TRIPPI: Look, that's going to happen. What are you going to say about a situation in which there is no good solution, right? I think the one thing, the coverage has been sort of off on is sort of allowing the Russians are filling the vacuum that America left or something. The reality is Syria is their last place in the region, and they've been there forever. They have should have been have been -- it's not in the context - - I understand in Iraq you can make that, we left and there was a vacuum and ISIS filled it, and all that, but the Russia thing just doesn't make any sense. I don't see any real coverage that makes clear the context...KURTZ: You mentioned Donald Trump earlier. Let me ask you, Chris, when Donald Trump told Bill O'Reilly that he would be happy to let Putin own Syria, because he views it as a quagmire, much of the pundit class gasped. Could that play very differently with voters?STIREWALT: Well, could play very differently with the libertarian wing and the Republican Party, Rand Paul's voters. You're not supposed to actually say the thing. You're supposed to say maybe we shouldn't be the policeman of the world, you're not supposed to fill in the next part and say in which a kleptocratic strongman from Russia will come in and dominate and change the whole dynamics of the region... KURTZ: But Trump comes out and says it.STIREWALT: Trump comes out and says the actual words.KURTZ: And many Americans are tired of war and our intervention.STIREWALT: But I don't think they're tired of the United States being cloudy and influential in the region.KURTZ: Is this the 3:00 a.m. call, Joe, in the sense that now there's a commander in chief test, where foreign policy has kind of receded recently?TRIPPI: Yeah, I don't think there's any doubt about that. The question is does that last? Again, almost always our Presidential politics is driven by the economy, and so yes, it's definitely put it there, you know, front burner, and this may be where Trump gets into trouble, because I'm not sure that some of the things he's saying are going to help him.KURTZ: Speaking of Donald Trump, he's on the cover of the New York Times Magazine today, a big profile at the top of the piece, initially I dismissed him as a nativist clown, and I was way too serious and high- minded, so I decided not to write about him, and I felt proud and honorable about my decision. Now he has thousands of the worlds. Does that capture the earlier media mindset about the Donald?LEE: Well, I think the media often thinking that -- or people think that media is setting the tone. And oftentimes the voters are telling us what the story is. That's exactly what's happen with Donald Trump. A lot of people thought it was silly season, and the voters are saying, no, we're taking a really hard look at him, and he's trending for a lot of reasons, and he's getting support and so you're forced to write about him...KURTZ: Shorter version of that, a lot of journalists were just wrong.All right, don't forget to send me a tweet @HowardKurtz, weigh in on the topic, weigh in on the on the media coverage.Ahead, is Robert Redford trying to salvage Dan Rather's reputation with his new movie.But when we come back, President Obama rushes to make the horrifying mass shooting in Oregon political, that's his word, and the media following his lead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: President Obama responded to the latest mass shooting -- the awful massacre of nine people on a college campus in Roseburg, Oregon with a passionate speech about often this is happening, and his failed push for some kind of gun control measures, and the pundits, of course, quickly chose sides.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine, my response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this. And of course what is also routine is that somebody somewhere will comment and says Obama politicized this issue. This is something we should politicize.HANNITY: I have said with all of these shootings, I was really disgusted with the president's comments tonight, his race to politicize this.LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSBC: The president feared routine in this. He fears exactly what I fear when one of these things happen is how do we come on and treat this as something that is not routine even though it has tragically become routine.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Carol, has the coverage become routine? Have we become inured to this?LEE: There are elements that are routine, and largely that's because -- what you're covering is routine. The Republicans come out and say the government is not the answer Democrats say we need more gun regulations, voters are not yet making this test for politicians...KURTZ: What about the horror of all these innocent people being killed by the mass shooters. Does that become routine as well? I fear it has.LEE: Yes, it has in a lot of ways but until something changes in the dynamic in the national debate, you're not going to get a change in the way it's covered.KURTZ: I don't have to accuse President Obama of being -- politicizing the issue. He is entitled to push for gun control measures and the media happy to jump on this. But my problem is with the timing, doing it on the day that it happened when bodies are still being carried, when people being taken to the hospital when the shooter hadn't been identified, to it then - - real problem.STIREWALT: It's gross, but here's the larger problem. Nothing the President is proposing would have prevented this and the coverage and the discussion of all of this suggests that somehow there's a piece of legislation, some bill that exists that the Republicans have absolutely we will not pass this legislation that would have addressed this or that would have addressed Sandy Hook, and the mistake that the President continues to make -- a mistake that the press continue toss make is to propose things that are related to guns and the regulation of them, but not to the problem at hand. So then they are surprised when people go, no, why would we do that? And that's the problem.KURTZ: I think one of the reasons for media fatigue on this issue is the President is proposing some action, at least on background checks. Yet everybody knows nothing is going to happen because Congress is absolutely deadlocked on this issue.TRIPPI: That's right and that's why you do it when everybody is paying attention.KURTZ: You know have no discomfort the President talking about control...TRIPPI: There's a big question, what about the 40 people who are shot in Chicago. The problem is you don't see 24 hour coverage on CNN, Fox, and MSNBC any of those troubles. So when suddenly look, the same day probably 30, 40, 50 million people are tuning in the...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: The Sheriff in Oregon, John Hanlin said -- urged the media not to report the shooter's name, not to keep showing his picture, which would glorify his horrific actions. I'm torn on this but I do worry that we are giving some of these psychopaths what they want.STIREWALT: Once is enough. Say his name, show his picture, shut up about him.LEE: I'm torn about it, too. I don't know the precise answer. I think it's legitimate to know who the shooter is.KURTZ: Of course we have to report who the shooter is initially. For me the third, fourth -- I don't care, these are sick people taking innocent lives and I don't want to reward them.TRIPPI: I agree, but in the end, in the social media age that we are living in, people are going to find that information. It's going to be out there.(CROSSTALK)TRIPPI: There are outlets for people who are...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Television doesn't have to make this constant refrain because it's out there. Anybody with a computer can get it.TRIPPI: Absolutely.KURTZ: All right. Good note to end on. Joe Trippi, Carol Lee, Chris Stirewalt, thanks very much for joining us this Sunday.Ahead on ""MediaBuzz,"" my interview with Rand Paul on his beef with Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and the coverage of his campaign, but first, Robert Redford's new film is called Truth. But will it tell the truth about Dan Rather and the discredited story on George W. Bush and the National Guard?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Dan Rather is understandably excited about Robert Redford's new movie Truth in which the legendary actor portrays him, but will this film tell the truth about Rather's biggest debacle, the scandal that cost him his anchor job at CBS. Sony declined to make an advanced screening but it's clear that this paints Rather and his producer Mary Mates played by Kate Blanchett as heroes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REDFORD: Tonight we have new information on the president's military service.Here's to a great story.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: I covered every aspect of this infamous story back in 2004, when Rather on the now defunct 30 Minutes accused President Bush of having gone AWOL on the National Guard. Rather now say this movie vindicates his view that the story was in fact true, but based on a book producer, Mary Mates who CBS fired after retracting the story.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CATE BLANCHETT AS MARY MAPES: They do not get to do this. They do not get to smack us just for asking the question.REDFORD: Somebody has to confirm the memos.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: This isn't a trial. This is a hunt.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: We're talking about you bringing your politics into your report.BLANCHETT: I did nothing of the kind. Our story was about whether the president fulfilled his service. Nobody wants to talk about that. They want to talk about fonts and forgeries.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: So here are the facts. The story was based heavily on memos said to have been written in the 1970s by Bush's late squadron commander, but when outsiders set the type written documents looked like they are done on a computer with Microsoft words, two of CBS' own experts told me they had warned about red flags that the papers might not be authentic, and a key source for the story deliberately misled CBS about how he got the documents.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL BURKETT, FORMER TEXAS AIR GUARD COMMANDER: Yes, I did.DAN RATHER, CBS NEWS: You lied to us.RATHER: Why would I or anyone mislead us about something else?(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Another key source, the supervisor for Bush's ex commander said he was, ""misled by CBS and believes the documents are forgeries,"" all of which led to this moment on the CBS Evening News.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RATHER: The failure of CBS News to do just that, to properly fully scrutinize the documents and their source led to our airing the documents when we should not have done so. It was a mistake. CBS News deeply regrets it. Also, I want to say personally and directly, I'm sorry.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: An outside investigation commissioned by CBS found the story deeply flawed, rushed to air because of a ""myopic zeal,"" and said the key source had an anti-Bush political agenda. Network President Les Moonvez called the whole affair a black eye for CBS. Rather was forced out of the anchor chair and then let go by 60 Minutes. He later filed a $70 million breach of contract suit against CBS, claiming that the parent company Viacom caved to pressure from the Bush administration and he lost. The whole fiasco was a sad ending to Rather's large and colorful career. He has every right to argue that this was political and corporate interference with truth telling investigative journalism. But I hope Robert Redford's movie doesn't whitewash what was a textbook study in journalistic malpractice.After the break, many pundits are writing off Rand Paul's Presidential campaign. He'll talk about that and more in our interview.And later, can obscure comic Trevor Noah really fill Jon Stewart's shoes?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: The media may be downgrading Rand Paul's chances in 2016 based on sagging polls and anemic fund raising, but he hasn't lost any of his feistiness. I spoke to the Presidential candidate here in Washington.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Rand Paul, welcome.PAUL: Thank you.KURTZ: In this week's battle in the Senate over a government shutdown and de-funding Planned Parenthood, you went after your rival Ted Cruz, you said he's pretty much done in the Senate. What do you mean?PAUL: I wouldn't call it going after. I was asked a question about different styles. I think we do have different styles. My style is when I disagree with someone, not to call them a name or be very inflammatory. I can be strong in what I believe in, and I'm willing to stand up for that, but even Harry Reid, who is on the opposite side from me have pretty good relations with him, even though he's a Democrat. And I wouldn't call him a liar or dishonest, because I don't think that furthers the debate, even with people you disagree with.KURTZ: As you know -- and as was dramatized by John Boehner's resignation, there was a strong hard-line faction in the house if you're not willing to potentially close down the government over de-funding Planned Parenthood, close down the government over getting rid of Obamacare, you're a squish, you're a rhino, and you're not fighting for principles, your thoughts.PAUL: Well, I do think that we should exert the power of the purse. I am one who says we haven't been doing enough, and that we control the house and the Senate. And Frankly I've been traveling the country and yes, conservatives and Republicans are very unhappy that we're not controlling the power of the purse. Many in Washington will say we don't have the votes, 60 votes to de-fund things. I say that's kind of backwards. If you let the spending expire, then to restart spending, take 60 votes...KURTZ: You've been mixing it up with Donald Trump, who tweeted prediction -- Rand Paul's been driven out of the race by my statements about him, he will announce soon, 1 percent. The gentleman from Kentucky has the floor.PAUL: I think the rumors of my demise are somewhat exaggerated, to say the least, and we're doing quite well actually. We run a tight ship around here and we plan being in for the long haul. And I think ultimately celebrity will filter out of this.KURTZ: You called Donald Trump a clown.PAUL: Yeah I think there are some clownish things he has said. I think also really what's probably more important is that I just don't believe he's a true conservative. I think that being for higher taxes, being for single payer health system, those aren't conservative notions. He was for the bank bailouts. He was also for President Obama's government stimulus package, but probably the biggest issue that makes me think that Trump is a fake conservative is that he's for using government's eminent domain to take property from small property owners and give it to big corporations like his. He's actually personally profited by having the government do his dirty work of taking people's property. There's nothing conservative about that.KURTZ: How do you come at the growing view in the media that your campaign is really struggling?PAUL: Well, I think one way is to look how well we do against Hillary Clinton. When you look at polls, we are not doing as well as some of the polls, but if you look at how well we do against the Democrats, we do much better that actually many people in the Republican Party. We actually lead Hillary Clinton in five states that were won by President Obama. What does that show? It shows we have the ability to attract independents, Democrats, and people that you need to come to your party if you think you're going to be able to win these battleground states.KURTZ: Time Magazine once called you the most interesting man in politics. Lately the headlines have not been so great.PAUL: I think I still I am the most interesting man in politics.  KURTZ: But it's hard for you to break through in an -- that's dominated by Trump and others.PAUL: The mood of people I think changes. But to me I'm exactly the same as I have always been. I talked about the same things, limited government, the constitution, privacy, the bill of rights, and I continue to see our crowds grow bigger and bigger. If I weren't reading the so-called pundits and I were traveling the country as I am, every day I see bigger crowds, every day I see more enthusiasm.KURTZ: One complaint is when you started out with a deep skepticism of U.S. military intervention overseas.PAUL: Still do have that.KURTZ: Let's talk about that because with the growing threat from ISIS and now Russia starting air strikes in Syria this week are you still skeptical about greater U.S. involvement in Syria?PAUL: Our founding fathers wanted it to be difficult to go to war. They gave the power to initiate war to Congress. And one of my complaints for a long time has been that the President is sort of taking over that power. It's not his power under the constitution. The first thing we should do, should we be in Syria? Should we be in Iraq? There needs to be a vote in Congress.KURTZ: What's Rand Paul's answer?PAUL: Well, what I would say I don't want boots on the ground to be U.S. boots on the ground. We've had an Iraq war, and frankly I think it was a mistake. In fact, I think every time that we have toppled a secular dictator in the Middle East, we've gotten chaos, the rise of radical Islam and actually made it more dangerous for us. I think that Hillary's war in Libya has actually made it less safe for us. The same goes though for Assad. We have many people, President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and some Republicans want to topple Assad, and I think it would be a mistake to topple Assad frankly because I think that would allow a power vacuum for ISIS to move into.KURTZ: CNBC just announced a three percent threshold for its debate which would you and some others in danger of not making the primetime stage. Do you think that is a fair approach by CNBC?PAUL: Interestingly, we looked at the criteria pretty closely because it affects us and it actually looks like it would include us. We see nothing about the criteria that they have put forward that wouldn't include us.KURTZ: Senator Paul thanks very much for joining us.PAUL: Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The Kentucky Senator has slipped below three percent in a couple recent polls so will have to reverse that trend.Coming up, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Jeb bush, Ben Carson all sitting down for a high-profile TV interviews. We'll have a score card.And later, the media are all over his Donald Trump's wife Melania, with lots of descriptions of her sexuality and modeling career. Give me a break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: The top Presidential candidates sitting down for a spate of high- stakes interviews, time to flip the script and look at how the anchors are doing in pinning down the politicians. Joining us now for our video verdict is David Zurawik, Television and Media Critic for the Baltimore Sun. Well, Donald Trump has been all over the airwaves this week, including a CNN interview with Don Lemon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DON LEMON, CNN But I'm just concerned if I ask you this question, if you answer directly. Do you think you are homophobic?DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No, I think I'm a very nice person. I love people. And I have to tell you, when you look at those polls and -- it's across the board.LEMON: So you think your appeal to African-Americans, some people may perceive you as racist. Answer that.TRUMP: So I just did a speech for the African-American Chamber of Commerce in South Carolina. And they just wrote the most beautiful letter I think I have received in a long time saying how unfairly I got treated by the press.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Homophobic, perceived as a fair question?DAVID ZURAWIK, THE BALTIMORE SUN: Howie, that question, that exchange, if it proves nothing else, it proves that you can ask Donald Trump the most outrageous question in the world, and he will deflect it and steamroller you which is what he did in that interview. Those questions are legitimate questions, but not asked in that manner. There's a way you build to that kind of question, and Lemon really with that choppy -- you can feel the uncertainty in his question, with the choppiness, and the mixed motives in his head come through from that -- really a bad to go at that.KURTZ: I didn't like some people say you're racist. All right, Jeb Bush now raising his TV profile a bit, he sat down with Matt Lauer on the ""Today Show.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT LAUER, 'TODAY SHOW': Clearly your resume and your pedigree are perfect for the job of President.BUSH: Thanks, Matt.LAUER: You come from a family of long history of public service. Your dad was President, your brother was President, and I don't mean to be funny about this. And after several months in the race you're losing in the polls to the host of Celebrity Apprentice. How do you get your arms around that?BUSH: It doesn't matter to me in October because when we get closer to February, people are going to know, does he care about me? Does he have ideas to lift me up?(END VIDEO CLIP)ZURAWIK: That's the interviewer as narcissist. Aren't I rhetorically clever, he's so clever with that question, and he sets him up. You guys didn't have it in the bite, but actually poor Jeb Bush bites on it about half way through and says thank you, and it's really embarrassing. I don't ever feel any sympathy when a candidate says gotcha question, but that was needlessly gotcha question to show his gullibility, and Lauer couldn't let it go.KURTZ: We disagree on that. I thought the question was perfectly fine.ZURAWIK: Because you're an interviewer.KURTZ: Ben Carson has been grilled about his initial comments about not advocating a Muslim President, a whole series of programs including by Martha Radish on ABC's This Week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC NEWS: Do you stand by that now?DR. BEN CARSON, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, first of all, I said on a...RADDATZ: I'm reading the transcript, Dr. Carson. That's exactly what you said.CARSON: Read the paragraph before that, where I said anybody, it doesn't matter their religious background, if they accept American values and principles and are willing to subjugate their religious beliefs to our constitution, I have no problem with them. Why do you guys always leave that part out, I wonder?RADDATZ: I don't think we do, Dr. Carson. It was quite clear. ""I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation.""(END VIDEO CLIP)ZURAWIK: This is the fascinating one. My reaction, at first, I thought she was hostile. I thought she was harsh, no, and then I realized that's the tone a journalistic interviewer should take. Ben Carson does that, he says that's not what I said, and she said, no, it's in the transcript. Then he said why don't you guys do this? She said, no, we do, do that, good for her. We have become so used to the schmooze-pants, late-night host interviewed Jimmy Fallon that we now think that's harsh. We're amusing ourselves and that she has the right journalistic tone and we've lost it.KURTZ: You're such a great guy, Zurawik, all right, enough schmoozing.Hillary Clinton finally on the Sunday circuit, and Chuck Todd pressed her about her email mess on Meet the Press.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But I guess what I'm trying to figure out is if you said in March -- that the email system began in March of '09, and yet we have the same email address popping up in January.CLINTON: There was a transition period. I wasn't that focused on my email account to be clear here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let me stop you here. You seemed to be -- to put an email server at your house, it's a complicated thing.CLINTON: Yeah, but it was already there.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Chuck Todd didn't give up on that.ZURAWIK: That's Chuck Todd as Lieutenant Colombo. At first I thought he was so deferential, but it was very effective interviewing. He caught her in changing her story over time, especially with the emails when she said I wasn't involved in the review, and then we found out earlier she was. That's very good. He was gentle, but he got good stuff out of her.KURTZ: The question is -- all right, stick around because next on ""MediaBuzz"", Hillary does SNL. Does scripted humor help her appear unscripted?And Trevor Noah tries to do the Daily Show, our review in just a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Hillary Clinton's aides told reporters she would be showcasing a warmer and funnier side. Maybe that's why she ended up playing a bartender last night on ""Saturday Night Live.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCKINNON: All anyone wants to talk about is Donald Trump?CLINTON: Donald Trump? Isn't he the one like, oh, you're all losers.MCKINNON: I guess I should get going. This has been so nice. You are really easy to talk to, Bill.CLINTON: You know thanks. That's the first time I've ever heard that.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: David Zurawik, did SNL pull it off and does this help Hillary?ZURAWIK: You actually showed Hillary's -- SNL treated her gently last night, very gently. If you saw Kate McKinnon, the other woman in it who's brilliant, in April when Hillary Clinton announced with that video, the night before McKinnon shredded it, deconstructed, and blew it up. So she had no choice but to go on SNL and try to be inside the joke rather than the butt of it. And I think in that sense it's successful. But I am really amazed at how gently they treated her. That was surprising. They were pretty hard on the Republicans and Bernie Sanders last night.KURTZ: That's why I thought it wasn't that funny because they weren't making any serious fun of Hillary Clinton. That's what you were expecting when you go on that show, but obviously it helps Hilly Clinton. Even Donald Trump said. All right, Trevor Noah is the new Jon Stewart on the Daily Show. This was his first week. Take a look at his debut.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TREVOR NOAH, 'DAILY SHOW': Jon Stewart was more than a late night host. He was in many ways our political dad. And it's weird because dad has left. And now it feels like the family has a new step dad. And he's black, which is not ideal.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: I know you've mixed it up with Jon Stewart, but he was a cultural force. Can Trevor Noah fill that chair?ZURAWIK: I think he's not going to fill the chair the way Jon Stewart did. Already after one week, who could be as politically engaged and passionate as Stewart? Whether you agreed with him or not, you felt he actually knew what went on in Congress in 1948. You know what I'm saying? He loved this stuff. He was the c-span. This is a guy who would watch c-span on a Sunday night. Trevor Noah, how could he possibly have that kind of American political background? I think Trevor Noah has grace. He has energy. He is a funny guy. He may make them actually younger in that audience. I think the first night they were down six years already in terms of demographic.KURTZ: To me, Trevor Noah was charming. He delivered the scripted lines well, but watching his interview, for example, with Chris Christie, I don't think as a South African he has much of a feel for American politics or the confidence to express it. So the question seemed to me to be not -- he wasn't -- you didn't have a sense he had a world view he's delivering a take and maybe it's unfair after one week. But I think that was the key to the show's success. Stewart really cared even if you hated what he shared.ZURAWIK: The opening night thing he did on Boehner, it was reading a script, not coming from within. Maybe people have said you want the ideology of Jon Stewart back? Here's a guy without an ideology. Give him a break.KURTZ: Right. It's a comedy show. If he's funny, they have a great set of writers. Is it important to have a world view, because that's what made the Daily Show special, was that Jon Stewart's humor was fueled by his anger about what was going on in politics.ZURAWIK: I totally agree, Howie. Trevor Noah probably won't do a piece blasting us tomorrow like Jon.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: It's only been a week so we'll give him a chance. David Zurawik thanks very much for stopping by and pulling out your critics out this Sunday.Still to come, your top tweets, and the media are suddenly leering over another Trump, the Donald's wife Melania, what is up with that?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: I'm buzzed off about this one. Two top Army generals talked about how to suppress a New York Times piece on a very serious topic, concussions from mandatory boxing classes at West Point by plotting to get USA Today or the Wall Street Journal to write about a more favorable study on army concussions. The brass involved according to a meeting summary obtained by the Times is Army General Surgeon Lieutenant General Patricia Horoho, and the West Point Supervisor Lieutenant General Robert Kazlan Jr. They spoke of deliberately delaying a response to the Times' freedom of information request while pushing the sympathetic version elsewhere which didn't work. Both generals say the summary misinterpreted their remarks, but it's pretty clear that these army officers paid by the taxpayers were trying to muffle a negative story on concussions and that just makes my head hurt.All right, time for your top tweets. Should TV news name the Oregon gunman and keep showing his picture? Sports TV metaphor, don't show nuts jumping on the field and it reduces the problem. Don't understand no naming attitude. Do anonymous killers make us safer? It will be better to enact strict gun control laws. Palm Claykum, will there ever be a serious conversation about this country's gun laws? Demagogue-free, no, it only hurts the family and his too for that matter. God bless all those affected by this tragedy. Amen.Well, Donald Trump's wife, Melania has given her first interview to People Magazine and the cover photo of the Trump clan is an absolute gift in reminding voters that he's the father of five kids. But suddenly the media are mad for Melania who made a rare appearance three years ago on Fox.(END VIDEO CLIP)MELANIA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMPS WIFE: Everybody has their own views. Everybody has their own opinions. And my husband has many millions and millions of followers.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And opinions.TRUMP: And opinions. And a lot of people agree with my husband. Some people don't. And that's where we stand. It will always be that way. Agree to disagree.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: New York Times has a huge profile that says if not for the Donald's candidacy, she'd be just another trophy spouse, seriously? The Times deleted a tweet from the candidate's wife with a close-up photo of her in a skimpy bikini bottom. What was that doing in the story in the first place? And here's a front page Washington Post profile that describes her posing naked 15 years ago -- for British G.Q., the icy blue green eyes, plump pout lips, lying seductively on a fluffy fur on Trump's private jet, wearing a sparkly necklace and not a stitch of clothing. Look, I get it writing about a former model is far more scintillating than covering most candidates spouses. But Melania Trump is by all accounts a nonpolitical person, a devoted mother, a savvy entrepreneur, can we please cool it a little bit with the heavy breathing?That's it for this edition of ""MediaBuzz"".

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight. Less than ten hours to go before the polls open on perhaps the most important day of the presidential campaign to date. And the race is taking an increasingly ugly and chaotic turn.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Over the past week we have witnessed a surge of angry confrontations on the campaign trail.  Many of which have centered in and around rallies for the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. His events are hardly the only ones that have been disrupted but they are the most high profile and we witnessed more of them today at at least two campaign stops.But today's disruptions, nothing, compared to what we witnessed in Chicago on Friday night. The situation there so tense the Trump campaign called off its event. The story was documented real-time right here on this show as well as on Showtime's hit series ""The Circus."" Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are hundreds, maybe even thousands of protesters on hand. Mike, the security does not have a handle on the situation here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tonight's rally will be postponed until another date.  Thank you very much. And please go in peace.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is becoming violent. There's pushing and shoving going on inside this arena. It is total chaos.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump joins me now live on the phone. Mr. Trump, do you believe that you have done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged?DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't take responsibility, nobody's been hurt in our rallies.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you regret saying any of those things about punching protesters, sending them out on stretchers?TRUMP: No, I don't regret it at all. I will say we've had tremendous success with people. You know, popularity that we have in the rallies, themselves, is love. I mean, it's a love fest.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have to ask you just for clarification, you have no regrets about anything that you have said?TRUMP: We have had great success, and frankly, I think we did a good job tonight. I think a lot of people are giving us a lot of credit.HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Before we begin, I want to say a few words about what happened in Chicago last night.GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump has created a toxic environment.CLINTON: The encouragement of violence and aggression is not only wrong, but dangerous.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump has got to be loud and clear and tell his supporters that violence at rallies is not what America is about and to end this.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I still at this moment continue to support the Republican nominee, but it's getting harder every day.  SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, as we campaign, we have protests, but unlike Donald Trump, I don't ask people in the audience to punch them in the face.  TRUMP: I will call up Carrier the President, cause I have to do it myself, I know it's not --(CROWD YELLING)(CROWD CHANTING)And to think I had such an easy life. What do I need this for?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: We're going to have much more from ""The Circus Tonight"" as we're joined by its co-creator and co-host, Mark McKinnon, who was in Chicago with the Trump camp Friday night. But first back to Mr. Trump who offered his own take on what happened in Chicago suggesting this was very much a coordinated effort.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We started to notice that all of a sudden almost simultaneous, almost like, you know, a certain time, a lot of protesters showed up and I guess it was a very staged thing with this MoveOn organization which is not a good group of people from what everybody tells me. And we met with the security, we met with law enforcement who did a, I think, terrific job.  They said it would be good not to be doing the speech because you would have had clashes and people could have been hurt or worse. And I think, and we've been given credit for this, hopefully we did the right thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And remember, all of this comes on the eve of a tight battle for the 367 delegates at stake in five states tomorrow.Joining me now to discuss it, Barry Bennett, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. Charles Cooke, a writer for ""The National Review"" and Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial analyst.Great to see you all. Charles, let me start with you on what we saw this weekend and whether you believe the critics who are pinning any of what we've seen at these Trump rallies on Donald Trump are -- whether they have a valid complaint.CHARLES COOKE, WRITER, THE NATIONAL REVIEW: Sure they do. I heard Bill O'Reilly earlier talking about where Donald Trump is obviously complicit with Charles Krauthammer. And there are obvious areas. I mean, he's promised to pay the legal fees of people who punch others, who hurt others.  He's failed to condemn those who have committed acts of violence, he refuses to admit that it happened and he harks back to this mythical era in American history in which you can just punch somebody in the face and get away with it. But I think it goes deeper than that. If you look at Donald Trump's campaign, he's built it around this mythical idea, this odd, almost pornographic idea of leadership, and power, and of confrontation.  KELLY: Strength.  COOKE: Strength. You know, its strength pushed both ways through Google translate so you end up with this odd conception that doesn't really exist.  He's a weak man's idea of a strong man. He's not Vladimir Putin. He's Roderick Spode from the P.G. Wodehouse novels going on about knees and you know, foreigners and knees and root vegetables because, you know, he's nothing about policy. He doesn't have a platform. And I know it's amusing but I'm quite serious --KELLY: I'm not sure I'm with you on the root vegetable part.COOKE: Well, it was rhetoric --KELLY: I was with you until then.  (LAUGHTER)COOKE: The point I'm making here is quite serious is that he's tried to build himself up as a strong man and he's done that because he knows nothing about policy. And he knows nothing about politics. Of course it was going to end like this. That's his entire shtick. He is complicit in this. He can't run away from it. He can't change it because this is his campaign.  KELLY: Barry Bennett, let me ask you because one of the points that Charles make is that rather incredible thing that Trump said on ""Meet the Press"" this weekend where he was reaffirming that he is having his people looking into paying the legal bills of this man -- this man at one of his rallies who saw a protester giving the finger to some of the protest -- to some of Donald Trump's supporters and the man reacted this way. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hold it up high.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh!  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you deserved it?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Every bit of it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What was that?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, he deserved it. The next time we see him, we might have to kill him.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: You tell me how Trump can offer to pay that man's legal fees and say that he is not -- he is not inviting more acts like that.BARRY BENNETT, INFORMAL ADVISER TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Well, I mean, no one's going to condone what that guy did, I mean, but that guy's almost 80- years-old. He made a big mistake. And, you know, he was in a rally. He's clearly a supporter. It's the only instance I think we can find of a rally supporter hitting somebody which we've seen, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of times now. And if it's going to ruin his life, then, you know, helping him out isn't the worst thing we can do.  KELLY: You don't see how that might encourage somebody who's maybe not 78- years-old to do the same?BENNETT: He's already said he doesn't condone it. I mean, there's only one -- that's the only Trump supporter you can find that's actually hit somebody. That is the entire sum of the violence --KELLY: Well, I don't know about that.  BENNETT: That's the entire sum of the violence --KELLY: I don't know about that, Barry. I don't know about that.BENNETT: Well, I mean, show me another one then.  KELLY: We've seen quite a bit of violence at these rallies.  BENNETT: We have. From professional protesters who, you know, 3,000 people show up in Chicago --KELLY: Well, there was a man who was pushing a black woman down who actually came out and said he really felt ashamed about it after the fact but the mob mentality against the protester led him to do it. That's just one example off the top of my head. But what --BENNETT: They come for this. This is why the protesters come.KELLY: I agree that it's true in some cases. I can see it.BENNETT: They want to be in front of the cameras and pick a fight.  KELLY: I can see it. But the question is, and I asked you this Judge whether there is a responsibility in your view by our leaders to raise the dialogue, to encourage peaceful behavior and to inspire us to do better?JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, there's a moral responsibility to do that but there's a constitutional obligation and it goes like this. If a speaker encourages violence and there's time for more speech to rebut or negate his before the violence happens, he's not responsible for it. But if a speaker encourages violence and people respond immediately to the -- with the violence that he has --KELLY: Which wasn't the case here.  ANDREW: Which doesn't appear to be the case then he's not responsible.  The courts will bend over backwards not to punish speech.KELLY: What do you make of it, Charles? Because now, you know, Trump's free speech rights were shut down. And it's not appropriate to shut down his right, I mean, that is so un-American and the Supreme Court has made clear but many times the answer to speech you do not like is not less speech, it's more speech, right?COOKE: Right.  KELLY: And now he's becoming a bit of a First Amendment martyr.  COOKE: He's not a First Amendment martyr. He's a Donald Trump martyr.  The only North Star he has is the one that shines light on him. Now, I totally agree with what the judge said. I'm a First Amendment absolutist.  I think that the decision in -- Ohio was a correct for example. I also think that the people who deliberately set out to shut down Donald Trump's rally are reprehensible. You don't do that, you don't try and suppress speech. And they said that's what they were trying to do. But morally he has a responsibility as the man on the state, regardless of what the law says, regardless of what those who were trying to provoke him say, he has a moral responsibility not to incite, not to make it worse and he doesn't do it. He says, well, I have would have hit him in the face or in the olden days he would have gone out in a stretcher. That's inappropriate.  KELLY: Uh-hm. Judge?NAPOLITANO: If he sends veiled messages to the people in his audience who are prone to violence and he knows it and intends it, then he has caused it. But our friend is right. When the remedy for bad speech is more speech, the remedy for hate speech is more speech, on the other hand, the Chicago police had an obligation to protect Donald Trump's free speech rights --KELLY: They did the best they could.NAPOLITANO: The audience's right to listen and the protesters' right to protest.  KELLY: They did the best they could. And that's what -- I mean, this country at its core is about encouraging speech and listening to viewpoints with which you disagree and no matter how vehemently you may. Great to see you all.  And speaking of Mr. Trump calling out his detractors, or in some cases reporters, this weekend he took issue with this reporter's assertion at the last presidential debate that his now-defunct school Trump University had received a D-minus rating from the better business bureau in 2010. Mr. Trump is off base. At the debate, Mr. Trump claimed that his embattled Trump University had been upgraded from the D-minus rating you see here to an ""A."" I noted that this had never been publicly available. During a commercial break, Mr. Trump approached the moderators with the document he claimed was proof of Trump University's ""A"" rating. The document shown here says nothing about Trump University but relates to another entity. We agreed to look into it, but apparently not fast enough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I gave you the report card. I gave you the ""A"" during the debate because they said it was a ""D"" and it was an ""A."" You did something very dishonest. You didn't report it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: After the debate, we made inquiries about that document which had not been authenticated or verified, in which the Better Business Bureau denied sending to Mr. Trump at the debate. On that night's KELLY FILE we offered the following.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Trump came over to us after that break and brought out a Better Business Bureau accreditation notice for the Trump entrepreneur initiative and this says that Trump's entrepreneur initiative on a scale of A to F has an ""A"" rating. But the point I was trying to make was, when Trump University was operating and got into trouble, it was given a ""D"" minus rating. That was the last public rating it had.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's right.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Exactly.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly.KELLY: He began under a new name, it had this ""A"" rating.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Mr. Trump now accuses your humble debate moderator of dishonesty.  We stand by our reporting which has been verified by multiple news organizations as well as the Better Business Bureau. Trump University had a ""D"" minus rating before it went out of business in 2010. The claim about the ""A"" is quite simply a head fake. The company at issue is Trump University, that's the business at the heart of the many fraud lawsuits.  In 2010, under siege Trump University changed its name to Trump entrepreneur initiative, or TEI. It was that business, TEI, only operational for a few months, that received an ""A"" and while Mr. Trump now claims that Trump University is not out of business --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I'm not out of business. It's not out of business. It's suspended until I win the lawsuit.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That, too, is untrue. Trump University no longer exists. Its successor, TEI, was effectively closed within weeks of opening. As Mr. Trump's own testimony in the case makes clear. Here's what he told a court in 2013. Quote, ""Within weeks of changing its name, TEI stopped accepting new students, offering live seminars or engaging in any advertising effectively ceasing its operations."" And those, folks, are the facts.  Also tonight a new bombshell in the controversy over Trump's campaign manager appearing to grab a Breitbart reporter after she asked a question.  That reporter, Michelle Fields, and one of her bosses, Ben Shapiro, one of her colleagues here to explain what has happened since then and why they have just resigned from Breitbart.Plus, campaign strategist Mark McKinnon were there as some GOP insiders wrestled with Trump's impact on 2016. Wait until you hear what the establishment said on camera.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VIN WEBER, FORMER CONGRESSMAN: I talk to people all of the time, as I'm sure everybody around the table does, and they say, ""Why don't you Republicans do something about this guy? I'm sorry. This is not the Soviet Union. We can't call a meeting and decide Trump is out.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new evidence in the case of an alleged assault by Donald Trump's campaign manager. Criminal charges are now proceeding against Corey Lewandowski after now former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields claimed Trump's top guy grabbed her arm so hard at a recent event that it left bruises. At first, Fields simply wanted an apology. What she got was something very different. The videos we have seen so far, like the one we just showed you, seem to show everything except the moment of alleged contact between Fields and Lewandowski. Lewandowski denied there ever was any contact. But new footage emerged over the weekend and now folks on both sides suggests it proves their case. Watch.Trace Gallagher live at the report in our West Coast Newsroom.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And remember, Megyn, the Trump campaign says not a single reporter or camera captured the alleged incident but we now have three different camera capturing what appears to be different angles of the incident. In the first you see red arrows pointing to Trump Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski and former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. The arrows then point to her arm and Lewandowski's arm.  Finally you see Fields abruptly pulled out of view. In angle two, we still don't see actual contact, but you do see Corey Lewandowski reaching over toward Michelle Fields. And the third video clearly shows Lewandowski walking past Michelle Fields and apparently pulling her out of the way.  Now listen to an audio recording of the incident where ""Washington Post"" reporter Ben Terris talks to Michelle Fields about what happened. Play.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE FIELDS, FORMER BREITBART REPORTER: I can't believe he just did that. That was so hard. Was that Corey?BEN TERRIS, WASHINGTON POST REPORTER: Yes, like, what threat were you?FIELDS: That was insane.TERRIS: Yes.FIELDS: You should have felt how hard he grabbed me.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Fields claims he grabbed her hard enough to leave bruises but Lewandowski calls her, quote, ""delusional and an attention seeker."" Donald Trump accuses her of making it up and Trump supporters are now citing the third video we showed you of proof that Lewandowski never touched her. At first Breitbart supported Fields, now it backs up Corey Lewandowski saying he was misidentified and the text messages prove he did not do it. Fields resigned. So did editor-at-large Ben Shapiro accusing Breitbart of protecting Trump and his, quote, ""bully campaign manager."" Breitbart then ran a piece on its home page reading, quote, ""Ben Shapiro betrays loyal Breitbart readers in pursuit of Fox News contributorship."" The piece was later removed and the editor who wrote it apologized. But now two other Breitbart employees have also resigned and its chief pr rep has dropped the company. Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURT BARDELLA, FORMER BREITBART SPOKESPERSON: It's one of the key reasons why I decided to resign working with Breitbart last week is because of their allegiance to Donald Trump and Breitbart's become a de facto Super PAC for the Donald Trump campaign.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: And Megyn, as you noted Michelle Fields has also filed a police report in this case -- Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you.Joining us tonight in ""The Kelly File"" exclusive, former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields and Ben Shapiro, the now former Breitbart editor-at-large.  He's also the current editor in chief of DailyWire.com. Great to see you both. So, Michelle, let me start with you. Why did you resign?FIELDS: Well, I realized that my company didn't have my back. I can't stand with a company that won't stand for me. They knew the truth from the very beginning. My editor as soon as it happened had spoken to Corey. He told me that Corey has admitted to it and I was getting an apology so I stayed quiet. I wasn't going to make a big deal about it. Look, it's bruises. Whatever. It's fine. I thought I'm not going to make a huge deal. And that didn't happen. I never got the apology. Instead they embarked on this smear campaign against me.So they knew the truth, my company knew the truth, and they're siding with Donald Trump and I have to say, you know, when this happened my Washington editor Matthew Boyle was telling me, oh, don't worry, this is going to be great because Donald Trump is going to give us so many exclusives now because they're going to feel like they have to do it because of what they did. This is how my company was looking at this. Instead of saying, wow, what happened, are you okay? Let's defend you. They were thinking that this was a good thing because we would get more access to Donald Trump.KELLY: They denied but Matthew Boyle and Corey Lewandowski are denying that they had a conversation. And produced an e-mail that Corey Lewandowski said to Boyle, you know, I never talked to on the phone. And Boyle seemed to acknowledge that fact.FIELDS: Well, let's see what he says if God forbid, we have to go to court and he subpoenaed and has to be on the stand testifying under oath.KELLY: Ben, why did you resign?BEN SHAPIRO, FORMER BREITBART EDITOR-AT-LARGE: I resigned because the fact is that Breitbart has unfortunately become a Trump Pravda site and the problem for me is that once you as any news organization, any media organization wants your loyalty to a political campaign, trumps your loyalty to your own supporters, I'm out. That is not something I can back, that's not something anybody decent should back and I'm disgusted by the fact that my mentor Andrew Breitbart started this organization to fight bullies and in my opinion, this organization has turned into an organization that actually promote bullies in order to get close contact with the bullying campaign.KELLY: How did that manifest itself Ben, prior to Michelle incident, you know, the field to Trump? People call it Trumpbart (ph).SHAPIRO: Yes, I mean, the fact is that I think any objective observer of Trump, at Breitbart News could see for months that Breitbart had become a very, very strong advocate for Donald Trump and look that's their prerogative. Any of your organization has the ability to set editorial.  The problem for me became absolutely clear when they decided to abandon their own reporter, and indeed undercut their own reporter. On Friday, they attempted to run a story, a very poorly evidence story in which they suggested the not only had Michelle basically batch the story that so had Ben Terris over at The Washington Post by misidentifying Lewandowski as a Secret Service agent, they did this on Breitbart. This is the site that Michelle reports for.Once your loyalty again out ways, though your loyalty of the campaign outweighs your loyalty to the people work for you, that is something Andrew Breitbart would never would have stood for. If Andrew Breitbart were alive today, Andrew Breitbart would have been down in Florida getting in Corey Lewandowski's face and Donald Trump's face in demanding an apology for Corey Lewandowski grabbing and bruising Michelle.  KELLY: Michelle, when you, you know, when this videotape came out today or yesterday, showing actual contact between you and Corey which he had denied, his supporters said this proves that this is a hoax, that Michelle Fields was not assaulted, she wasn't thrown down to the ground which you had not alleged but other people had suggested and they believe that this does not show a criminal assault. Your response to those folks.  FIELDS: Well, I didn't want to file a criminal complaint. I never wanted to do that. The reason I did is because I was being accused of putting makeup on my arm to show that there were bruises. I needed a report to show people that this happened. And let me say, Corey in the beginning said he had never met me before, that I was delusional, that this did not happen. Now if you look at the campaign's approach and their Spokesperson Katrina Pierson's approach, is that well, it did happen but it wasn't that hard. This is a campaign that continues to lie. I never wanted it to get this way. Those bruises will heal. My problem is the smearing of my name, my reputation. I have to fight back.  KELLY: But first they said that there was no video of the incident. Now we've seen that's true. Then they said there were no witnesses --FIELDS: And no eyewitness.  KELLY: -- that witnessed it and that's not true, ""The Washington Post.""  And then he said he never had any contact with you, now we've seen that is not true. Although those who suggested that you'd been pushed down to the ground, you know, in one report they said that's obviously not true either.  Ben, I want to ask you about the smear. Because, boy, Corey Lewandowski who, you know, it may be known to our viewers, has issued threats before.  Came after her and tried to -- I mean, they're basically trying to destroy her, Michelle's reputation. Saying that he's an attention seeker, and she tries to make herself a story, that she fabricates things. That's the implication. There's an article out today suggesting that that is a sexist smear. Your thoughts?SHAPIRO: It is a sexist smear. I mean, the fact that the Corey Lewandowski was putting at reports from discredited websites, that he was accusing Michelle of being an attention seeker who had done this sort of thing in the past to gain attention to herself. And all that Corey Lewandowski had to do to stop this was apologize essentially and say that he didn't mean to do it. That is basically although that would stop this.  Instead he decided to lie and smear and Breitbart decided to go right along with that.KELLY: So, why is this a story? And Ben, in your view, Ben, apart from you know, the implosion of Breitbart and it's part of the civil war that we're seeing in some, you know, from some on the right, why is this a story?SHAPIRO: Well, I mean, I think the idolatrize worship of the Trump campaign by some people in the media leading to them covering up the truth is a major story and as you say, I think it's, again, a story because the Trump campaign never acknowledges mistakes. Never acknowledges their responsibility for violence. Never acknowledges anything that they do wrong. It's a no-apologies campaign. That's why he's popular. But that does that have consequences and it does have victims. You know, in this case, it was just a bruise on the arm. But, you know, there are other cases where it's more than that.KELLY: Thank you, both, for being here. You can see Michelle's full interview that she did with yours truly along with the full response from the Trump campaign. This did not get to air in our normal 9:00 time slot because of the breaking news out of Chicago. It aired at 3:00 a.m. So, you may have missed it. But go to Facebook.com/thekellyfile or on Twitter @MegynKelly to see Michelle's story and the Trump campaign rebuttal.  Plus, we have new delegate math tonight ahead of tomorrow night's critical Republican primaries. Chris Stirewalt is here on the possible path this race may take and how it may end up in a contested convention in Cleveland.And when campaign insider Mark McKinnon took his cameras into a dinner full of GOP establishment types, things got interesting and the results are next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've never voted for anybody other than Republican for president of the United States. This will not be an easy thing for me.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back to ""The Kelly File."" So, we have been following the craziness of the 2016 GOP race, our next guest has been filming the whole thing up close and personal.Behind the scenes for the show time political series ""The Circus."" Recently, Mark McKinnon and his cameras stopped by a lunch with some GOP establishment types. You know the type. They were talking about, wait for it, Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICK HOHLT, MAJOR GOP FUNDRAISER: Everybody around this table that I know, we've been in every presidential campaign probably since 1980 in various degrees, and in Trump's problem he doesn't have a -- you don't know what his compass is.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And how problematic is that for the future of the party?HOHLT: I think before it's all over, it's going to be hugely problematic.VIN WEBER, FORMER MINNESOTA CONGRESSMAN: I talk to people all the time. As I'm sure as they are on the table and they say, why don't you republicans do something about this guy?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sorry, this is not the Soviet Union. We can't call a meeting and decide Trump is out.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We hate that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.RON KAUFMAN, FORMER GEORGE W. BUSH ADVISOR: Denying dictatorship, who's for it? Trump is doing well for one reason. He understands that the climate and the culture of America today better than anybody at this table.MARK MCKINNON, ""THE CIRCUS"" CO-CREATOR & CO-HOST: How do you feel about the republican nominee may be someone that none of you not shell shocked.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bewildered. Republicans are hierarchical, respectful of authority. We fall in line. And Trump has interrupted that cycle.Donald Trump, nobody thought of him as any kind of political leader until six months ago.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's not articulate, he's not poised, he's not informed. All he has going for him is a lot of votes. Why hasn't any of that hit home? Here we are. Here we are.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Mark McKinnon, former chief media adviser to George W. Bush, and co-creator and co-host of the weekly documentary series ""The Circus"" on Show Time. Mark, great to see you.I think Donald Trump should put that an ad, he could just run that as an ad for himself, am I wrong?MCKINNON: Well, no, exactly. I mean, all the Trump supporters that saw that say that's exactly why we support this guy.KELLY: Right. Right.MCKINNON: And, well, we went out to find the members of the establishment and we found the six that are left.KELLY: There they are. You found the room in which they eat.MCKINNON: We did. And the interesting thing was, of course, that there's really no consensus among them except that they're completely bewildered about what to do. A couple of them are RNC members and they basically say, well, if he's nominated then we'll support him.A couple of them are actually running behind super PACS trying to fight him and a couple of them said, you know, under no circumstances are we going to vote for him. So, there's no consensus within the establishment that's left about what to do, and hence, the chaos.KELLY: But that sentiment about how we're republicans, there's a hierarchy, we fall in line. It's like people's heads are exploding right now say, I don't think so, wrong, wrong, sir. I mean, that -- that's exactly the problem is that mentality and then it was interesting to hear the other guy talk about how there is no -- they keep waiting for the establishment to go get Trump. Like, there is no one. There isn't some Calvary that can just shut it down.MCKINNON: Well, there's that. I mean, that's the Calvary, those six guys. Clearly they're not -- they're not going to ride out and save it.KELLY: No wonder the establishment is losing.MCKINNON: Yes.KELLY: With all due respect to those guys. They seem like nice people.MCKINNON: Well, they are, they're smart guys and have been around a long time. And one of them said, which is one thing that's really true, which is they said Donald Trump has a better finger on the pulse of American voters than we do.KELLY: That's right. And that's the mystery to all of them. They don't get why he resonates with the voters and continues to resonate. And I know you're talking about, you know, the state of the Republican Party right now and what it stands for right now.And you said that there are three types of republicans at the moment, bewildered, bewitched, and confused. Who are those people? Why do you separate them like that?MCKINNON: Well, I mean, there are those who are just bewildered by the phenomena of what's happening with Trump. And then of those who are just bewitched and think it's inevitable and then there's those that are just bothered by it and, you know, aren't going to vote for Trump under any circumstances.So, that's -- I mean, it goes to the whole point about there's no consensus in the Republican Party. People are all over the map about what to do. And it's that chaos that has really fueled a lot of the success that Trump has had because there's no -- there's no unified front.KELLY: And just today, John Kasich suggested that he might go back on that pledge to support the eventual nominee, whoever it may be, saying I got to think about this and I'm going to have an announcement about that later.Marco Rubio suggested he's making it harder and harder. You know, he's expressing doubt. So, even these guys who are still in the race other than Ted Cruz are starting to wiggle on whether they could ultimately get behind him.MCKINNON: Well, they are wiggling and I think part of that is, you know, the events of the last few days. It's just become a very volatile toxic atmosphere and I think that people flushing forward are trying to think how is this going to represent the Republican Party where at large and where our party goes not just this next election cycle but way beyond that?You know, what's the real foundation, a philosophical underpinnings of the party and how does Donald Trump change that equation. Do we want to be part of that?KELLY: Represent the party or demolish the party and start a new? I mean, is that -- is that a Trump nominee actually...(CROSSTALK)MCKINNON: Well, the irony -- the irony of all of this, of course, as you remember, a year ago or so, the republicans were forcing Donald Trump to sign -- to sign a pledge saying he'd run in the party and not run as a third-party candidate.KELLY: That's right.MCKINNON: Now it's just the opposite.KELLY: He didn't like that question in August. I bet he wants to see those pledges right now. Fork them over.MCKINNON: That's right.KELLY: Great to see you, Mark. Great show.MCKINNON: Thanks, Megyn. Kick it.KELLY: Up next, Congressman Duncan Hunter was one of the first member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump. He'll weigh in on the establishment, the campaign trail chaos and all the rest of it.Plus, one polling company decided to ask voters about the violence at these campaign rallies and we'll have the eye-opening results for you on what effect it's happening -- it's having on Super Tuesday 2 when Chris Stirewalt joins us just ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Forget about the election for a moment. There's a broader issue in our political culture in this country. I think we all need to take a step back and ask ourselves, are we contributing to this? Because if this continues, I don't think this country will continue to be ripped apart at the seams.You saw those images last night of people getting in their face often divided up among racial lines in many cases. The police officers bleeding from the head. Reminiscent of images from the '60s. I mean, we're going backwards here. This is a frightening, grotesque, and disturbing development in American politics.I believe Donald Trump as our nominee is going to shatter and fracture the Republican Party and the conservative movement. I still, at this moment, continue to intend to support the republican nominee, but getting harder every day.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was presidential candidate Marco Rubio, fielding questions about the state of the race and the current front-runner in a news conference with reporters on Saturday morning.Joining me to respond, Donald Trump supporter and California Congressman Duncan Hunter. Great to see you, Congressman.So, what are your thoughts on that, that the predictions of doom that we heard from him and from some of those guys sitting around that round table moments ago, should Donald Trump become the nominee?REP. DUNCAN HUNTER, R-CALIF.: Well, from Senator Rubio, he's in the race, right, so he's going to -- he has his own opinion. He's in the fight. You always feel differently when you're in the fight.But here's what this is. If people are going to vote for Donald Trump, in the millions, more people than have voted in a decade, and they're going to vote for him, that is the GOP establishment. It isn't the global corporatists or the intellectual elite that are angry that they're not going to be in the administration.The people are the party. The republican people are the party. I'm not the party. I'm simply a representative of a few hundred thousand people in San Diego.And I'll tell you what, too, Megyn, when I came back from Afghanistan from my third tour, right, I came back and I ran for office in San Diego. I was not on city council. I was never in the State Senate or something. So, I jumped ahead of all of these guys that had been planning for years to run for U.S. Congress. I jumped in front of all of them.I'll tell you what, that upsets people, that makes them angry. I mean, that's something that does upset people. And I can see the anger coming out of all these people that had this planned and they were going to be in the establishment, they were going to be really big movers and shakers. Guess what, now they're not. And that upsets them.KELLY: They got Trumped.HUNTER: I'm sorry. They got Trumped.KELLY: So, that was amazing listening to the guys talking in the roundtable saying he's not articulate, he's not poised, he's not informed, all he has going for him is a lot of votes.HUNTER: Right. You know, take any businessman...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Right. That is how it works.HUNTER: ... right. Take any businessmen in America and put him on TV and they're going to inarticulate and they're not going to be poised and they're going to go, hey, I'm running for president, I'm running for Congress. But all it takes is vote.If the American people like Donald Trump, they are Republican Party.KELLY: They are the bosses.HUNTER: And that's it. That's right.KELLY: They are the bosses not the guys that sit around the table. And it doesn't mean the other guys can't make a good run for it, but it does show you how the GOP, quote, ""establishment got caught"" so much on its heels, like -- I don't -- where is the hierarchy? What is going -- where -- who is -- why haven't they kissed the ring?HUNTER: Yes. What, who, where, yes. There is no hierarchy, though. The American people get vote. I mean, this is what's right about America. The American people get to vote, right? And it doesn't matter who endorses who, it doesn't matter whether you put in $100 million or $30 million. If the American people don't like you, they're not going to vote for you.KELLY: That's right.HUNTER: If they like you, then you're going to win. It's that simple.KELLY: That's right. It's like -- it's like the juries in court. They have a way of figuring it out despite the spin.HUNTER: And the American people are not stupid. They know what they're doing and they can tell -- I mean, you know, we meet people every day, Megyn, you meet people every day. You can tell if they're fake or they're an honest person.The American people can tell. I mean, oh, my gosh, we've had 12 debates now. I mean, I think that they know who Donald Trump is at this point and they're still voting for him.KELLY: Well, they should -- we're just going to have just one more and then they're going to get to know him a little better. There's a Fox News debate on Monday.HUNTER: Good.KELLY: Great to see you, Congressman Hunter. Great to see you.HUNTER: Thank you.KELLY: Again, with just more than nine hours now, right? Just more than nine hours until the polls open for Super Tuesday 2, we have got some eye- opening new numbers from a top pollster and then from Chris Stirewalt, next. Here they come.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight. It is 9.50 Eastern Time and at this hour, live pictures of Marco Rubio campaigning in Florida. Ted Cruz campaigning in Illinois. A little more than nine hours before the polls open for Super Tuesday 2.In the key State of Ohio, Monmouth University polling shows Ohio Governor John Kasich leading with 40 percent to Trump's 35. In Florida Mr. Trump is in first with 44 percent. Florida Senator Rubio is in second with 27 percent.So, what do we make of these? Patrick Murray is director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, Chris Stirewalt is also here. he's our Fox News digital politics editor, part of decision desk.Patrick, so let's talk about these numbers. I mean, just bottom line it for us. Does Kasich going to win Ohio or Trump is going to win Ohio?PATRICK MURRAY, MONMOUTH UNIVERSITY POLLING INSTITUTE DIRECTOR: It's going to be close. Definitely it's going to...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Come on! We want to knowCHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: I could have told you that.MURRAY: I trust my numbers. I've had actually, I've done really well with predicting where Kasich was going to do well in terms of our polls, so I think he's going to pull it off.KELLY: OK. If you look at the Real Clear Politics average, I like to look those because it shows you all the polls in recent weeks.MURRAY: Yes.KELLY: You just look over at the far right side and what you see in Ohio is Kasich, Kasich, Kasich, Kasich. Right? Which suggest, OK, I think I know how this is going to go.MURRAY: Yes.KELLY: Same thing for Trump down in Florida where, I mean, you know, you hear Marco Rubio talk. Like, I don't believe those polls. Those polls are wrong.MURRAY: We have it at 17 points and that's actually I think on the lower end from flips some of these polls are showing and we had at 8 points a week ago. So, Trump is doubled...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Why is that? What is that, just sort of the...MURRAY: I think...KELLY: Aura of invincibility.MURRAY: ... there's been -- there have been a lot of attack ads against Marco Rubio in Florida. His job approval rating among primary voters, republican primary voters is about 60 percent, which is low in your own party.KELLY: That's actually higher than the poll we saw for him last week. It was almost 50.(CROSSTALK)MURRAY: Yes.KELLY: It was 40 percent.MURRAY: Yes. I mean, that's just not good. I also think the events of Friday night actually had something to do with it...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Yes. Tell us. How did that affect voters?MURRAY: Well, we actually, yes, after Friday night happened, we were actually we're interviewing Friday night, so in Saturday and Sunday night we actually added a question about the events in Chicago and how they made you feel about Trump.Two thirds said, had no impact either way. But 22 percent said it made them more likely to support Trump versus 11 percent who said less likely and that's a few points. And in fact, more importantly, we saw on Saturday and Sunday nights Trump's lead widens from where it was republican...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Republicans don't like to see that kind behavior. That's not -- that's not their thing, right? You're always talking about how republicans more like, OK, I'm going to wait in line and I'm not going to talk to the exit poll people and I'm not going to go out there and protest, I'm just going to vote them out of office.MURRAY: Right.KELLY: OK. So, tomorrow night, if Patrick's right, because you've heard it right here, he predicted that Rubio is going to lose -- no. He didn't.MURRAY: I'll say it. I'll say it. Yes, Rubio's going to lose Florida.KELLY: Oh, wow, he did it. OK. So, if Rubio loses Florida and Kasich wins Ohio, Chris, what does that mean for this race going forward?STIREWALT: Well, it depends a great deal about what happens in Illinois, Missouri, and North Carolina because there are more delegates at stake in those three other states that are proportionally allocated.The reason we gave so much tension to Florida and Ohio is that they are winner-take-all. Boom. You win them 99 delegates in Florida, what is it?MURRAY: It's 65.STIREWALT: A 65 in Ohio. I haven't written down. It will be OK. But the other three states have more delegates combined when you look at them, especially Illinois. A huge trove of delegates. So, what are we looking at Ted Cruz especially in Missouri, Illinois and North Carolina. How's he doing there?We don't expect him to win either one of the winner-take-all states. We expect that Kasich, the polling would indicate that we expect Kasich Ohio. Trump Florida. Now as Bernie Sanders demonstrated in Michigan last week, sometimes the polls are wrong.KELLY: Right.STIREWALT: But that's what the polls tell us. But we're looking closely to see how these counties especially the ones that are close to places where Ted Cruz has done well before.KELLY: So, if Cruz does reasonably well in those states and Ohio and Florida split, as we just discussed, is this thing headed for an open convention, you know, contested?STIREWALT: Well, yes or maybe another thing happens. Maybe the other thing that happens is that the republicans suck it up and have a Ted Cruz sandwich. They have resisted this for a long time.But if Marco Rubio gets knocked out of the race, if he loses in Florida, especially if he losses by a margin and not carting well in the other states, it is possible that the republicans will say as much as we do not like the guy who has been lighting our castle on fire with torches for four years, maybe we'll back this guy.KELLY: It's like you have a few Martinis and suddenly you start to look like a lot better.STIREWALT: He's in 6 b's, right.KELLY: OK. Great to see you both. We'll be right back.STIREWALT: Just saying.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So, tune in tomorrow to Fox News for Super Tuesday 2 starts at 7 p.m. Eastern. Yours truly and Mr. Baier will bring you the results, a huge night. Could determine this whole thing. Then stay tuned for a late night ""Kelly File"" at 11 p.m. See you then.

4	4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/05/19/authorities-intensify-search-for-debris-from-egyptair-crash/	Authorities intensify search for debris from EgyptAir crash	"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" May 19, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And this is a Fox News Alert. Welcome to ""Hannity.""Tonight, at this hour, authorities are searching for answers after an EgyptAir plane crashed into the Mediterranean Sea. Sixty-six people were on board. The plane was traveling from Paris to Cairo. And according to reports, Russian and Egyptian officials think terrorism might be to blame.Joining us now from the -- from London with the very latest is our own Kitty Logan -- Kitty.KITTY LOGAN, FOX CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Sean, well, terrorism is one of many possible scenarios, but for authorities to establish exactly what went wrong with this aircraft, they first need to find it.Now, Egypt has ordered search efforts to be intensified, particularly in the waters south of the Greek coast, where the plane may have crashed.  There were early reports of sightings of wreckage, but EgyptAir now says none has been found so far.The aircraft was flying from Paris towards Cairo around 24 hours ago when it disappeared off the radar shortly after it crossed into Egyptian airspace from Greece.There were, as you say, 66 passengers and crew on board. EgyptAir issued a statement tonight offering condolences to relatives of the missing, a sign, sadly, that they don't expect any survivors. So the wait goes on for anxious relatives whose loved ones never showed up at Cairo's airport.  This and other previous aviation incidents in Egypt have heightened fears about flying in and out of the country.Now, the U.S. Navy has sent aircraft to support Greece in search and rescue efforts, but until the wreckage, and crucially the black boxes, are found, what happened to this plane may remain a mystery -- Sean.HANNITY: All right, Kitty. Thank you.Our own Lea Gabrielle is at the ""Hannity"" big board tonight with more on what happened right before EgyptAir flight 804 disappeared.Lea, with your background and experience, I know you have a lot of insight here.LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Sean, you know authorities are still trying to locate EgyptAir flight 804. Earlier today, Egyptian officials did provide some information as to what happened before the plane disappeared.So less than an hour prior to the aircraft's scheduled arrival in Cairo, Egypt, the Airbus A320 was cruising at an altitude of 38,000 feet. Now -- - now, that's when authorities say that it took a 90-degree left-hand turn before moving 360 degrees, essentially flipping to the right, and dropping more than 20,000 feet, eventually vanishing from radar at around 10,000 feet.Well, the Egyptian military says it did not receive a distress call, and according to the Associated Press, an airport official indicated earlier that the pilot did not send one, which could mean that whatever caused the plane to plummet happened suddenly -- Sean.HANNITY: Let me ask you this, though, Lea, based on your experience, because we keep looking and we keep hearing -- all right, so it veered left, if veered right, it went down 22,000 feet. This is viewed as -- the A320 is viewed as a -- the Airbus is a workhorse. It flies multiple flights a day. They never have any problems. It's on a superb maintenance program.So I think terrorism -- first thing that comes to my mind.GABRIELLE: Well, Sean, I think that's a great point because this is a region that is very dangerous right now. You know, you have lots going on in the Sinai peninsula. You have ISIS. You have the ISIS affiliate in Egypt. So it is a hotbed of terrorism in this region.But let me just also present some other information. At this point, there have been no indication -- we have found no debris on the surface. Then when this first happened, I think a lot of people thought, OK, this disappeared at 37,000 feet off the radar. That would indicate the airplane essentially just blew up in flight.But then we learned more information that we saw it turn one way, then the other. As a pilot, that looks like out-of-control flight, perhaps a spin, which would cause a very severe nose-dive towards the water.Now it looks to me more like this aircraft may have been more in one piece because of the fact that we haven't seen a debris field. And the fact that we haven't found any indications of that aircraft so far. Still opens the door to terrorism. It opens the door to mechanical failure. It opens the door to a pilot that's suicidal. It opens the door to a lot of things.But at this point, you know, they'll be looking for that aircraft. I think they're more likely to find it in more of one piece than some large explosive debris field.HANNITY: Lea, you told me, in your experience, you actually saw a large plane crash in one piece, and it went straight to the bottom.GABRIELLE: Well, you know, Sean, you're referring back to when I was flying F-18s for the Navy. And this was when I was on deployment in 2002 in the Adriatic Sea. Very sad story. We lost one of our pilots. He was doing practice bombing runs at night, going about a 45-degree dive towards the water, about 450 miles, 500 miles per hour. We actually knew exactly where his location was when he crashed. Another pilot was watching. But we never found the aircraft.It was in a very nose-down dive, going very fast. And again if the aircraft is all in one piece, you're not going to see a lot of debris floating like you would if the aircraft actually explodes above the surface, Sean.HANNITY: All right, Lea. By the way, she did fly F-18s. Amazing story.  Thanks for sharing that insight. We appreciate it.Here now with reaction, former commercial pilot and aerospace journalist Kathleen Bangs is with us, one of Donald Trump's foreign policy advisers and FOX News Middle East analyst, Dr. Walid Phares is with us, and former National Security Council staffer Gillian Turner is here, as well.Gillian, let me start with you. You heard what Lea had to say. Our first thought has to be terror. I'm thinking they had three air marshals on board, 22,000-foot plunge. That doesn't happen very often.GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It really doesn't, especially the idea that a plane sort of spontaneously combusts mid-flight is virtually unheard of. The hesitancy, the reluctance here has to do with the families. You want to be careful to not preemptively call something an incident of terrorism and cause unnecessary trauma to the family members of the passengers who were on board.But the reality is, once there's an inking that a terrorist activity might be in the works here, you want to call it as soon as possible because you want to, as a government, be able to bring every resource to bear in this investigation. Since the Egyptians announced earlier today that terrorism was kind of on the docket here with a potential...HANNITY: Oh, has to be. Yes.TURNER: ... we've seen a great rallying cry...HANNITY: Planes don't disappear on their own.TURNER: Exactly.HANNITY: And they usually don't fall out of the sky, either.Kathleen, let's talk about this particular plane, the Airbus. It's well known for its safety features, is it not? It's one of the safest planes in the air.KATHLEEN BANGS, FMR. COMMERCIAL PILOT AND AEROSPACE JOURNALIST: Yes. I mean, the A320 has an admirable record. There's thousands of these flying.  As you mentioned, you know, earlier on this network all day today, it's a workhorse in the industry, comparable to a Boeing 737. So it has been involved in a lot of high-profile accidents in the last few years, but you have to balance that with that there's just many, many Airbus A320s out there.I think what we really need to find out, Sean, is why has there been no satellite infrared heat signature. It was erroneously reported this morning that there was one, but now the U.S. government officials have taken that back.If you recall with the Metrojet crash in Egypt last year, within three days, they had confirmation that satellites overhead did get a heat signature indicating that there was a bomb on board. But we've yet to be able to get any confirmation on that. In fact, U.S. satellites are saying so far they don't see any indication of a heat signature where this EgyptAir Airbus A320 went down in the Mediterranean.HANNITY: Yea. All right. Let me -- let me ask Walid -- look, here's the problem. Radical Islamic terrorism seems to be at war with the rest of the world. We have incident after incident happening worldwide. So when somebody like myself thinks, OK, there's three air marshals on board, that means that they're armed. That means that people charged the cockpit, they probably would have been stopped.So either something happened within the cockpit, either one of the pilots was a terrorist, or it had to be a bomb on that plane because otherwise, I would assume that the air marshals would get them. So I'm thinking of the possibilities here. Is it normal reaction to people to think terrorism?WALID PHARES, FOX MIDEAST AND TERRORISM ANALYST: Absolutely. If we are at war, as you just mentioned, Sean, with the jihadists, so this is an event that we have to read it with that perspective, though we will have to wait for the black box to be discovered. Then we'll have the full truth.Now we are 24 hours only after the incident, but yet you see a consensus between the Russians, the Egyptians and directly (ph) the French because they've ordered a security investigation in Paris. We see that investigation trending towards terrorism. And if this is the case, Egypt is under attack by the jihadists in the Sinai, across the country...HANNITY: Oh, all over.PHARES: ... from Libya -- all over.HANNITY: Yes, I mean, we've watched all of this unfold when you saw General -- General el Sisi come into power, and of course, you had the head of the Muslim Brotherhood in power for a period of time, so there's inner turmoil, conflict, jihadi -- a jihadi element targeting Egypt.Gillian, let me go back to you for a second. I did learn one thing today from a source of mine, that at Charles de Gaulle airport, they discovered after the Paris bombing there were 57 people that were on the terror watch list working at that airport. Some, as I understand it, were removed, but some still on the watch listed had access to those airplanes in Paris!(CROSSTALK)TURNER: It baffles the mind.HANNITY: It does, right?TURNER: I mean, it defies explanation. There is no possible explanation.  It's outrageous. And there's not really anything else to say about it.When it comes to aviation security, though, what we're really seeing is that we have to be mindful of the fact that the terrorists are actually innovating faster than governments are able to come up with new prevention and screening measures. And that's a core problem here. New kinds of underwear bombs, new kinds of shoe bombs and ways to conceal them are being developed right now as we sit here and talk tonight, probably headquartered out of AQAP, which is Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, very active there...HANNITY: Paris is not known for the same type of security measures we use here in the United States. You had people on a terror watch list, and they were still -- they still had access to airplanes. Very stupid.Kathleen, let me go back to you. I want to talk about the 22,000-foot plunge that this airplane took. And your experience -- because I know you have to go through a lot of training and simulator training -- you go through instances where a plane is in a freefall, but it's not likely to ever happen. Even if all the engines went out, that would not be the normal pattern of an airplane descent, would it.BANKS: No. But actually, Sean, this loss of control that you talk about, which we've lost more and more jets to over the last few years -- very high-profile accidents such as Air Asia, Air France, were all loss of control, meaning the pilots had a perfectly good airplane. They actually initiated their own demise.So around the world, different aviation agencies have enforced the airlines, and some of the airlines have done it voluntarily, to start doing this training. But there's many carriers that haven't started. In fact, Air Asia, when they went back and looked at the pilot records, they found out that they had not engaged in any of this loss of control training.So if something did happen up there, this might have been the first time that these pilots saw it.HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE) from cruising altitude and drop 22,000 feet in that period of time in the way that -- in the manner in which they described.Thank you all for being with us. Appreciate your time. Thank you so much.And coming up -- authorities continue to investigate whether or not terrorism is, in fact, to blame for the disappearance of the Egyptair jetliner. Now, the flight originated from Paris, as I mentioned, and early this month, well, French officials -- they warned of ISIS attacks.  Catherine Herridge is on the story. She'll have a full report.And then later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Are they going to interview Paula Jones? Are they going to interview Kathleen Willey? In one case, it's about exposure, and another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a women's will.DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: And rape.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump unloads on Bill Clinton's indiscretions. It happened right here on ""Hannity"" last night. Laura Ingraham tonight weighs in.Plus, brand-new national head-to-head polls now show Donald Trump plus 5 against Hillary Clinton. That and more tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And this is a Fox News Alert. So as authorities try to piece together exactly what happened with EgyptAir flight 804, a French spy chief is saying tonight that ISIS is preparing to strike again in France.FOX News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge joins us now with the very latest -- Catherine.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: A transcript released earlier today shows that France's equivalent of the CIA director warned on May 10th that a string of terrorist attacks by ISIS using package bombs was possible, though his comments focused on stadiums and places where large crowds get together and did not specifically cite aviation.""Clearly, France is most threatened, and we know that Daesh, the Islamic State, is planning new attacks,"" Patrick Calvar (ph) told the French government committee. It's in a position where it would try to hit as quickly as possible and as hard as possible.Meantime, French prosecutors are now focused on airport workers at Charles de Gaulle who had access to flight 804 before it left Paris. That means investigators are exploring the same scenario that brought down a Russian Metrojet in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, last October, where an airport worker placed a bomb on board.Speaking in Washington today, the Homeland Security chairman said the evidence is limited and preliminary, but also drew a possible connection.REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL, R-TEXAS: The threat indicators are very likely that we're dealing once again with a Sharm el-Sheikh type of attack, an insider threat where a bomb could have placed on that aircraft either one using a timing device that would have started out of Cairo, or whether it was luggage put in the cargo hold.(END VIDEOTAPE)HERRIDGE: This morning, the French parliament approved a two-month extension of the state of emergency that began after November's ISIS attack in Paris on a stadium, concert hall and restaurants. France's homeland security minister said the terrorist threat is high and the measure will cover the upcoming soccer championships -- Sean.HANNITY: All right, Catherine Herridge, thank you.Joining us now with more reaction is the religious director of the Islamic Center for Greater Toledo, Imam Talal Eid is with us. Also, former FBI agent Manny Gomez. And back with us, National Security Council staffer Gillian Turner.Manny, we'll go you. We've seen this happen again and again. My first thought is terrorism. Your reaction.MANNY GOMEZ, FMR. FBI SPECIAL AGENT: I agree with you. Planes just don't drop from the air without a distress signal. This could still be a mechanical malfunction. We have to find the plane, find out what happened, do a forensic investigation. However, just prima facie evidence indicates that this plane was attacked.HANNITY: Especially with three air marshals on board, right?GOMEZ: Absolutely.HANNITY: Because if something happened, somebody approached the cockpit, they would have come up.GOMEZ: Absolutely.HANNITY: And there were not a lot of people on the plane, relatively speaking, 55 people, passengers.GOMEZ: Right.HANNITY: All right, Imam, let me go to what Donald Trump said. He went after Hillary Clinton for using -- for refusing to use the word ""radical Islam."" It's the number one threat the world faces. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Today, we had a terrible tragedy, and she came up and she said that Donald Trump talked about radical Islamic terrorism, which she doesn't want to use. She used a different term because she doesn't want to use that term. She refuses to use that term!And I'm saying to myself what just happened about 12 hours ago, a plane got blown out of the sky! And if anything -- if anybody thinks it wasn't blown out of the sky, you're 100 percent wrong folks, OK? You're 100 percent wrong.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Imam, tell us why people should not think this is radical Islamic terrorism. Shouldn't it be people's first thoughts, based on the history of the last 15, 20, 30 years in the world?IMAM TALAL EID, ISLAMIC CENTER OF GREATER TOLEDO: Well, good evening, Sean, and thank you for having me on your show. Now, today, it's a very sad day. There is no doubt. And you can see the people whom we say that they are the victims of...HANNITY: I appreciate that, but we don't have a lot of time. So my question is...EID: OK.HANNITY: ... isn't it the normal thought process, based on what has happened...EID: No, it's not normal...HANNITY: ... around the world...(CROSSTALK)EID: It is not because I tell you the people who died are Muslims and non- Muslims, OK? So...HANNITY: You're right. Radical Islamists kill innocent Muslims, too.  You're right. But radical Islam is a threat to...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... is a threat to good people all around the world, regardless of their religious affiliation.EID: So if you want to call it -- the problem with calling it radical Muslims or radical Islam -- the problem here...HANNITY: Do you deny that...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Do you deny radical Islam exists? Do you deny that radical Islam is a threat?EID: It's whether I deny or not deny...HANNITY: I'm asking, do you acknowledge radical Islam is a threat?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Sir, I'm asking.EID: There are people who are using...HANNITY: Do you acknowledge...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... that radical Islam is a threat to Christians and Muslims and Jews and innocent people worldwide?EID: Yes, but there are -- those are...(CROSSTALK)EID: There are radical Christians. There are radical Jews.HANNITY: Really?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Give me an example of what radical Christians and what radical Jews have done recently in terms of terror attacks.EID: Well, you can go to David Koresh and you can understand...HANNITY: David Koresh? That's your answer?(CROSSTALK)EID: He was acting -- yes, you can go to...HANNITY: David Koresh is your answer?EID: ... Amir, who assassinated Itzhak Rabin...HANNITY: Are you denying that radical Islam is a clear and present danger to human beings worldwide?EID: Look, I don't want to sound -- yes, I don't want to sound that I'm justifying for those radical people, OK?HANNITY: What's your reaction?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: We got other people. What's your reaction?EID: This term can be interpreted in differently...GOMEZ: I think that's outrageous. Bringing up David Koresh as an example of Christian -- apparently, radicalization is ridiculous. Islamic radicalization is a fact. We're living through it. It's going to continue.Europe is asleep at the wheel. They're not taking the necessary steps to address it and eradicate it themselves and help us do it, as well.HANNITY: But Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and Janet Napolitano and all these other people -- man-caused disasters, overseas contingency operations, workplace violence -- that was the Fort Hood explanation for such a long period of time. Why is this there the mysterious reluctance, resistance to identify, Gillian, a simple truth?TURNER: Here's the thing. It's very important from a counterterrorism perspective for us to name and label and define the enemy because they take great care to define us, whether it's calling us infidels, non-believers, what have you. Without identifying -- without identifying the adversary, there's no hope of building a strategy, of eventually implementing that strategy with any degree of success.HANNITY: Infidel, jihad, holy war, non-believers -- we're talking about the Koran, aren't we? Is that all in the Koran? Is that in the Koran?GOMEZ: Absolutely.HANNITY: Is that in the Koran, Imam, infidels, holy war, jihad? Is that in the Koran?EID: The incidence in the Koran? No, it is not...HANNITY: No?EID: ... in the Koran.HANNITY: I read the Koran. That's not true!(CROSSTALK)EID: When you read the Koran, you need to understand...HANNITY: I read it!EID: ... the background. You need to be aware of the translation. There is no such ""infidels"" in the Koran. There is...HANNITY: Take neither Christians...EID: ... a term ""disbelievers.""HANNITY: ... nor Jews as your friends? Where's that from?(CROSSTALK)EID: ... ""disbelievers"" is not ""infidels.""HANNITY: Are the words, Take neither Christians nor Jews from your friends -- that's in the Koran, sir. Look it up! You're the imam. You should know...(CROSSTALK)EID: Yes, but there is something else in the Koran that -- you're dealing with the Christians and Jews in -- in...HANNITY: Take neither Christians nor Jews for your friends.EID: You don't harm them. You don't help them. This is...HANNITY: You don't help them?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: So Islam teaches people not to help Christians and Jews.EID: Islam teaches...HANNITY: Who are the infidels...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Who are the infidels that jihad is supposed to be waged against, sir?EID: Well, this is your own interpretation. But when you go to the actual interpretation of the Koran...HANNITY: Oh, I went to the actual interpretation.EID: ... you're not going to find...HANNITY: I talked to many scholars and experts.EID: ... such thing as infidels or...HANNITY: I've got to go.EID: ... (INAUDIBLE) or hate non-Muslims...HANNITY: Thank you for your time.EID: And there are American Muslims...HANNITY: When we come back, this is up next tonight on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Are they going to interview Paula Jones? Are they going to interview Kathleen Willey? In one case, it's about exposure, and another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a women's will.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: And rape.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump makes that explosive comment about Bill Clinton last night right here on this program. Laura Ingraham -- she'll weigh in next.And also, brand-new national polls, Donald Trump plus 3, Donald Trump plus 5 over Hillary Clinton. Tucker Carlson and Eboni Williams -- they'll weigh in on that and more tonight on this busy news night here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: I looked at The New York Times. Are they going to interview Juanita Broaddrick? Are they going to interview Paula Jones? Are they going to interview Kathleen Willey? In one case, it's about exposure, and another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a women's will.TRUMP: And rape.HANNITY: And rape.TRUMP: Big settlements, massive settlements.HANNITY: $850,000 to Paula Jones.TRUMP: And lots of other things, and impeachment for lying.HANNITY: Smearing, besmirchment of women.TRUMP: And losing your law license. He lost his law license, OK?  Couldn't practice law. And you don't read about this on Clinton.HANNITY: Let me ask you...TRUMP: Now -- now The New York Times, and if you look at Stephanopoulos -- these are like the pipe organs for Hillary Clinton.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Well said. Donald Trump last night on this program talking about President Bill Clinton's history of sexual misconduct. Now, this comes just days after The New York Times released a now largely debunked, discredited hit piece regarding Donald Trump's treatment of women.So will The Times write a 20-page piece expose about Bill Clinton's scandalous past? Now, we invited the two New York Times authors on the show tonight. They declined to appear on the program. Big shock.Joining us, though, with reaction, the editor-in-chief of Lifezette.com, FOX News contributor Laura Ingraham. It's nearly 20 printed pages, totally debunked in a matter of 24 hours! The guy -- it turns out one of the writers tweeting anti-Trump material out regularly.Why isn't he fired? And number two, is there any of the other 16 candidates on the Republican side that would have had the courage to do what Donald Trump did last night? I don't think so.LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No, Donald Trump has made himself available, Sean, for an interview with you. I watched the entire interview. He was forthcoming on every question you asked him, and I think that's what he has to do.But I will say this. He has that ace in his back pocket, the way that Hillary treated all of Bill Clinton's victims. Every time they bring up the -- Oh, Donald Trump's anti-women -- well, I mean, he has that ace in his back pocket. But I really do believe in this election cycle, all those efforts to smear Trump have failed.You saw all of the Republican candidates who got into the personal tangles with Trump -- they made fun of him for his hair, his intellect. They said he wasn't presidential. There were lot of personal attacks, and he dished it out, too. But all of those personal attacks failed, Sean, because more people in the end believe that he would do the things, the policies and enact the laws with the help of Congress that were actually going to make the lives of the average American better.So I think he needs to stick to the substantive...HANNITY: Agreed.INGRAHAM: ... concerns of the country...HANNITY: But he...(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: Absolutely. And I think he's done -- absolutely, an I think he's done that. But I do believe that, you know, he doesn't have to dwell on the personal attacks because the Clintons are going to try to avoid debating him on the substantive issues of the World Trade Organization, the failed dot.com -- dot bomb, the -- the -- the dot.com bubble that Bill Clinton left in George Bush's lap.So the idea that the Clinton economy was great -- well, until it wasn't, until it completely exploded, and now we see what happened with China entering the WTO, all of those issues. So I think -- I think he's on pretty good footing there.HANNITY: You know, I agree on both points, but I also agree -- yes, I agree substance first, but yesterday was a pretty substantive day. I mean, he released the names of the people he would like to appoint to the Supreme Court.And then if you noticed last night, I went issue by issue -- balancing the budget, energy independence, eliminating Common Core, building up our military, fixing the broken VA, all of those issues -- How committed are you to these things? And he said yes.But the big difference to me and what was missing with John McCain or Bob Dole or Governor Romney -- they get called racist and sexist and they want to kill Grandma, and they never fight back! They never punch back. Donald Trump will fight like other candidates have not fought. To me, it's refreshing.INGRAHAM: Yes, it's refreshing, and I think the fearlessness that he has is very inspiring. When someone is timid or they're constantly apologizing -- Oh, I wish I said it this way, and -- the left loves that because they think, Oh, it shows that you have introspection and you're so reflective.But what happens when Republicans do that is they get back on their heels.  And we saw that with Romney. We saw that with McCain. We see that repeatedly with the Republicans in Congress. And instead, make a forceful case for American renewal, the America movement, as I like to call it, keep hammering on the issues of terrible trade deals, open borders, all the things you've been exposing, Sean, and I've been trying to talk about on radio for years.Keep hammering on those issues, and when they come at you personally, I think he's absolutely right, hit back...HANNITY: Yes.EID: ... and do not start, you know, getting back on your heels. That's a loser proposition.HANNITY: I totally -- you know...EID: ... and I think he's handled it pretty well so far.HANNITY: And it's interesting because it works. Hillary Clinton was on CNN this morning -- I think there were a couple of relevant questions -- Do you think Paula Jones -- to Hillary. Do you think Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey are lying? Do you like the way these women were smeared and slandered and besmirched? Why didn't you speak out about it.? Why did you take money from Saudi Arabia and other countries that have horrible track records and not speak out against them?But anyway, here is her response on CNN this morning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: Do you ever feel compelled to defend your honor, the honor of your husband-...HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No.CUOMO: ... in (ph) statements that he's making that go to the core of the relationship?CLINTON: No, not at all. I know that that's exactly what he is fishing for, and I'm not going to be responding.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: She cannot answer that question. It's impossible, but you know it drives her nuts.LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE.COM: Again, her surrogates in the press will attack Trump. Trump's a liar, Trump's this, Trump's that.  But the moment that there's pushback from actual women or Trump himself, the other side goes silent, or they say, well, we didn't include all of her quotes. Next time we'll do a follow up report. But the damage they think is already done.But I really believe that for most voters this is all white noise. I think most people believe either Hillary is going to make their life better or Trump with the way he approaches substantive policy.HANNITY: I agree. That's all true. But I also believe that's this was a big week for Trump in this way. ""The New York Times,"" they drew out every weapon in their arsenal, and they tried to take him out. And it backfired.  All these women that came to Trump's defense and debunked that article in less than 24 hours was amazing. And now it's Hillary and Bill are on defense. It was a pretty stunning week.INGRAHAM: Yes it was. And it's textbook as to how you have to handle the media in this campaign. You don't want it to distract you from your overall message, but when they come at you, you have got to slice back, and you have to slice back at them really hard. And next time they're probably going to think twice before they at least try that tact. But they're going to be throwing more things at him.HANNITY: The next thing is he's racist. They'll try that.INGRAHAM: He's going to be anti-Latino, anti-this, anti-that. But I really believe in my heart of hearts, especially when you're looking at that FOX poll, Sean, people are wising up to this. And the Clinton way did not work. It did not work on trade. It didn't work on the economy. It looks old and sounds old.HANNITY: In an unconventional, insurgent year, I don't think it works either. All right, Laura, you're the best. Thank you.INGRAHAM: Thank you.HANNITY: And coming up, Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton now by five points in a brand new general election poll. How worried should she be?  Tucker Carlson, Eboni Williams, they'll react.And then later, Donald Trump says that he'll be adding to his list of potential Supreme Court nominees that he would choose from if he's the next president. We'll have reaction straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" And tonight Hillary Clinton has a new reason to worry. A brand new Fox News poll shows that Donald Trump is beating her in a potential general election matchup, 45-42, and today a brand new Rasmussen Report poll shows an even bigger lead for Trump. He's beating Hillary by five points, 42-37. Here with reaction is Fox News contributors Tucker Carlson and Eboni Williams. Eboni, good to see you.  I've got to wonder, if I'm a Democrat and I'm looking at these numbers, I'm looking at Pennsylvania and I'm looking at Ohio and Florida, I'm thinking uh-oh, do we want to abandon ship?EBONI WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, they're saying uh-oh, and that's why they're pushing Bernie Sanders to get out of this race because they are getting nervous. They are seeing those numbers, Sean. She is looking weaker and weaker. Trump is looking stronger and stronger. And she's got to build a new playbook. She has even said her old everything being a right wing conspiracy play book is not going to work against Donald Trump. So she needs time now, right.HANNITY: They don't have a new play book. That's a good point. Tucker, we know the playbook. Republicans are racist, Republicans are sexist, gender war, Republicans hate women, they want to throw grandma over the cliff. Donald Trump punches back twice as hard or 10 times harder. It's not going to work against him. What do they do?CARLSON: Because he's not running an identity politics campaign and they are. And so the person who is running is by definition the shallower campaign. They're now running on ideas. They're running on physical attributes.I would say there are two things to note from this poll. It doesn't mean Trump is going to win in the fall. It means he could win in the fall. And it also means that almost every single person who has commented on this race for the last year has been not just wrong but spectacularly wrong.HANNITY: By the way, Tucker, you have not been wrong. I have not been wrong.CARLSON: I appreciate that.HANNITY: And there's a few others of us that have not been so wrong. But you are dead right. A lot of people have been wrong for a year and a half and they're still commenting and making wrong predictions.CARLSON: But you have to ask yourself, why are they so off? They're not just sort of wrong, not off by five points, but they say Trump could never ever win. Really? Look at these numbers. So it tells you that they don't understand the dynamics behind this campaign. It's not about Trump. It's about the people who are voting for Trump, and they don't understand why those people would vote for Trump.WILLIAMS: I have an idea to Tucker's question. It's because so many that comment on this stuff, they are stuck in this beltway thinking, they are stuck in old guard conventional wisdom, and it just doesn't apply here.  Tucker also made a good point about Trump not representing identity politics. I even push it further. I think he doesn't represent partisan politics. And I know there are some on the right that cringe when I say that, but I think he transcends the classical conservative, Republican candidate.HANNITY: I actually agree with you. I think he's solution-oriented. I spent too much time interviewing him, and I got criticized for the interviews, but when you actually listen, he's giving ideas to solve problems. And in this unconventional, insurgency year, think about this, and I'll throw this to Tucker. You've got him beating 16 very big name Republicans, and Hillary is battling a 74-year-old angry, bitter, curmudgeon socialist from Vermont. And she's having a hard time. She can't close it out. Doesn't that show a deep level of weakness?CARLSON: That's part of what it tells you. It also tells you the candidates who address the economic concerns and fears of the middle class win, and the candidates who are off in some theoretical world lose.(CROSSTALK)CARLSON: They have to believe you, but even if they believed Hillary, what are elite Democrats running on? They're running on transgender bathrooms and global warning. You can even agree with those things, but they don't speak to the actual concerns of actual people. Bernie Sanders who is obviously a socialist and a crazy person, he is running on the fact that the average person is really worried about not having enough money. He's running on wages, and that's a real issue.HANNITY: I don't think Bill Clinton did the Democratic Party a lot of favors. He almost now has put a referendum out there on transgender bathrooms. And most Americans, actually if you are physically a man, they prefer you go to the men's room. If you're physically a women you go to the women's room. And the fact that he's made that issue so prominent and Hillary has had to comment on it, doesn't that hurt her?WILLIAMS: I think to Tucker's point, it becomes a distraction, right, because ultimately whether you agree with it or you don't, that is not going to be a go to the polls type of motivator the way the pocket book concerns are going to be. And I also --HANNITY: If this was a referendum item, what do you think the number would be nationally?WILLIAMS: Seven. I really don't think it's that important.HANNITY: In other words I think it's a 90/10 issue. What do you think, Tucker?CARLSON: Yes, or 93/7. I completely agree. The point is they don't care what the average person thinks. And so you can agree or disagree, but it's inherently anti-democratic. And by the way, this is a democracy. And so candidates who openly don't care what voters think lose, and they should.HANNITY: Last word, Eboni.WILLIAMS: Last word. I think the biggest criticism I have of Hillary, and I think this is going to come back to haunt her, she's been in such power for almost 30 some years, and what has she done to really elevate and move the middle class in country forward? And that's a good question I think she has to answer.HANNITY: I don't think she has an answer. I ask people on my radio show.  We play ""Jeopardy"" music. Tell me three things Hillary has accomplished that has improved the lives of the average American, and nobody can answer.  ""Well, she -- she -- she,"" and that's the answer.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: All right, guys, good to see you.WILLIAMS: Thank you.HANNITY: And coming up, after getting positive reviews from conservatives, Donald Trump says he will be adding to the list of potential Supreme Court nominees that he would pick if in fact he wins the White House. Our panel will weigh in with reaction next as ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Now, it has been one day since Donald Trump released a list of possible Supreme Court nominations, and many conservatives, they have already given his picks very positive reviews.  And Donald Trump indicated that his list may be growing. He tweeted out, quote, ""My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court justices was very well received. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list.""Joining us now with analysis from the American Center for Law and Justice, Jay Sekulow, and member of the Federalist Society and chief counsel and policy director for the Judicial Crisis Network, Carrie Severino, and director of the Edwin Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at Heritage, John Malcolm. Good to see you. Jay, I've talk to a lot of people that know the people on this list. Not one person has anything but high praise for this list.JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: This is a great list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court. You have got justices that have served with Justice Scalia as law clerk, Justice Thomas, Chief Justice Rehnquist. They come with broad and serious credentials. They have published opinions. They've served on the court for a number of years.  You're not guessing where their judicial philosophy is emanating from.  They understand the role of a justice of the Supreme Court is not to make law.So I think no matter what anybody thinks, the fact of the matter is the lasting legacy of a president is often the Supreme Court of the United States. And I think you're looking at the next -- we know we have a vacancy. There may be several others. This is the Supreme Court for a couple of generations. There's a lot the stake. These nominees are great across the board. Not one in there you would not be happy to have.HANNITY: And Jay, you say that as somebody who has argued a number of times before the Supreme Court.SEKULOW: Yes.HANNITY: Carrie, my understanding is Donald Trump did a lot of research.  He checked in with the Heritage Foundation. He checked in with the Federalist Society. He ran the list of names by senators and other people.  This was a pretty expensive vetting process. Are you happy with it?CARRIE SEVERINO, JUDICIAL CRISIS: Yes. I think all the research really shows. He has the right people and he took some great advice. I love that he includes people that are often overlooked, like state Supreme Court justices, giving us a really good view of what they would really be like on a Supreme Court, because they've been in a state Supreme Court. Now you have an even better sense of how they might perform in a U.S. Supreme Court, because, as we know, it's a lifetime appointment. You want to make sure you get it right, someone with a really solid judicial philosophy and who has the courage to stand up under pressure.HANNITY: I would say this, if I can, John, Republicans often get it wrong, Republican presidents. In other words, we're told that a justice, like John Roberts, is going to be an originalist. He disappointed a lot of people, including myself, especially in the ObamaCare care ruling. So do you feel that this list would -- are you confident this list is no disappointments if in fact they got to the court?JOHN MALCOLM, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION: You could have added Earl Warren, William Brennan, and John Paul Stevens to that list.HANNITY: That's true, OK, good points.MALCOLM: Look, five of the names on the list were also on my list, which the Heritage Foundation published. The remaining six judges all appear to be very eminently qualified, men and women have a proper view of the modest role that a judge plays. We're going to interpret the text of statutes in the constitution based on the actual words themselves and not use them as empty vessels to pour in their personal or political biases.These are eminently qualified people. And a Carrie just pointed out, six of them are sitting circuit court judges. Five of them are sitting state Supreme Court justices. And I might add that one of the ones on the circuit court spent time on the Wisconsin Supreme Court as well. These are men, women who very well qualified with a broad breadth of experience.HANNITY: Well said. Do you see problems, Jay, for any of the 11 going up against Democrats, knowing that they play politics, Robert Bork, Clarence Thomas, two names come to mind, with judicial picks?SEKULOW: MaGillis Rodney (ph), remember what they did to him. And the fact of the matter is, look, I think you've got to keep control of the United States Senate. And that is going to be very important here because I think any one of these nominees, you're already seeing the left criticizing these individuals. Why? Because they know that they have a judicial philosophy that's more like Scalia, and that is what they don't want.So I think we have to be prepared if Donald Trump is the president of the United States to defend these nominees aggressively. And that means you can't just win the presidency. You've got to maintain control of the Senate. It sure would be good to get 60 conservatives in that United States Senate to make sure you don't have a problem. Every one of these will be a fight worth taking.HANNITY: Or you can follow Harry Reid, the new rules, and circumvent precedents, change them. Carrie, I think this is really important. As you look at this list of people, do you see any problems?SEVERINO: You know, I don't. And I see the real strong contrast, for example, with what the president has put forward in Judge Garhand. He has a really bad record on the Second Amendment. On this list we've got people like Judge Sykes and Judge Hardiman folks that stood up for the Second Amendment. His judge tends to defer to the EPA and other unaccountable bureaucratic agencies every chance he gets. We've got people like Judge Kethledge who has stood up to the IRA and stands up to these agencies. So I think for all of the points where we see Judge Garland going with the liberal majority, we see people here who show what it is like to stand up for the constitution against the kind of things presidential Obama has been trying to do.HANNITY: John, we'll give you the last word.MALCOLM: Look, I think that some of the people could well face a confirmation fight. Bill Pryor certainly hard a very hard time getting on to the 11th circuit in the first place. But these are people worth fighting for. And you need to have a president who is prepared to stand by them to the bitter end and to get them across the goal line.HANNITY: I have to believe this will go a long way to maybe some conservatives that had doubts about Donald Trump's commitment to conservatism, one of the most important jobs any president will have.  Thank you all for being with us. Appreciate it.And coming up, we have more ""Hannity"" right after this break. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Unfortunately that's all the time we have left this evening. Before we go, quick programming note. Be sure tune in tomorrow night, 10:00 eastern, a special edition of ""Hannity."" For the hours we're going to examine how Donald Trump can take on Hillary Clinton in the fall and the differences. Again, that's tomorrow night, 10:00 eastern. We hope you'll set your DVR so you never miss an episode.  We take attendance and we get very upset if you're not there. Anyway, see you back here tomorrow night.

7	7	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/01/29/are-hillary-e-mails-finally-making-democrats-nervous/	Are Hillary's e-mails finally making Democrats nervous?	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" January 29, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone on my e-mail. There is no classified material. So I'm certainly well aware of the classification requirements, and did not send classified material.JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: The State Department will be denying in full seven e-mail chains found in 22 documents representing 37 pages. The documents are being upgraded at the request of the intelligence community because they contain a category of top secret information. These documents were not marked classified at the time they were sent.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: The State Department explaining this latest failure to release e- mails at the deadline they're required to, prompting questions at the White House about this investigation today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS: Can you say with certainty and confidence that Secretary Clinton will not be indicted?JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: That would be a decision that is made by the Department of Justice and prosecutors over there. What I know that some officials over there have said is that she is not a target of the investigation. So that does not seem to be the direction that it's trending. But I'm certainly not going to weigh in on a decision or in that process in any way. That is a decision to be made solely by independent prosecutors. But again, based on what we know from the Department of Justice it does not seem to be heading in that direction.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Our producer at the Justice Department, Matt Dean, said this. ""A law enforcement source close to the DOJ investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server is pushing back hard against Josh Earnest's remarks this afternoon that the investigation is not trending in the direction of an indictment. This source tells FOX News that the investigation is still very much ongoing and added with certainty that the decision has not been made on the matter one way or the other.""With that preamble, we've moved over to accommodate our panel. And let's bring them in, Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, and David Catanese, senior politics writer for U.S. News and World Report.A.B., it seems like this is snowballing. It seems like this is getting bigger.A.B. STODDARD, THE HILL: Yes. I spoke with Democrats in Washington this week who are getting very nervous about where this is going and how serious this has become, and that there is no way to say, as Brian Fallon, the Clinton campaign spokesperson said today, it's over- classification run amok.And today they're pretty frantic that a cabinet secretary like Secretary Vilsack, would come out and say that the timing of this is suspect, and call, I mean, call into question with intelligence sources in our government that their involvement of political intervention in any way to hurt her campaign is preposterous. And it is becoming a really big political problem not for her but for President Obama. At some point it will look like the executive branch is covering up for her.BAIER: Steve, we've had Secretary Vilsack come out. We played that sound bite earlier with Governor Huckabee, and he did say that. The Clinton campaign had said that they suspected the inspector general of the intelligence community was somehow politically working with Republicans to hurt Hillary Clinton. So now it is snowballing, as A.B. says, about the White House.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes. Politico had a piece about the questions that the Clinton team has raised about one of the investigators involved in this way down in the weeds. This is the Clinton playbook, right? Take shots at anybody who might be involved in the investigation regardless of whether they work for the Obama administration, regardless of whether they might be career intelligence officials. You need to tar everybody involved because that's the only answer to this question.To A.B.'s point, I think we're actually at the point where the White House looks like it may be involved in a cover up in this. What we heard from Josh Earnest today from the podium at the White House was extraordinary. I mean, he said two things that struck me. What I know is that some officials have said she is not a target of the investigation. To my knowledge, nobody has said that on the record. That's what Clinton team is saying that DOJ officials are saying. We don't have people from the Department of Justice making those kinds of blanket declarations.BAIER: That was the quote that I read from Justice.HAYES: Right, exactly, exactly.And second, Josh Earnest said based on what we know from the Department of Justice, it does not seem to be headed in that direction regarding an indictment. What does the White House know from the Department of Justice? Who is doing the briefing? What information are they sharing? What guidelines are they using to determine what information in this ongoing criminal investigation the Department of Justice is sharing with the White House?BAIER: In fact, the FBI director was up on Capitol Hill and told lawmakers, David, that he was not briefing the president on every detail of this investigation as it's going on. This is sticky politically.DAVID CATANESE, U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT: And the Clinton campaign is now calling for the release of all of it, which is convenient for them because they have no control over the release of these classified pieces of information.But, look, in the Democratic primary, it may not be the issue that we think it is. An NBC/""Wall Street Journal"" poll back in the fall said 70 percent of Democrats don't care about this. I think this does hand a talking point to all the Republicans in the race looking at a general election against Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders' campaign would not comment on this today.BAIER: To that point, I went out to the Bernie Sanders campaign. We'll play this sound bite again when I asked them about it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Clearly you have momentum according to the polls and your message is resonating in places like this and others in New Hampshire and Iowa. I'm wondering with the backdrop of the email investigation with the FBI if now you regret saying at the beginning that you didn't give a damn about Hillary Clinton's emails.BERNIE SANDERS, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No, absolutely no regrets at all. In fact, I would argue that the reason we are doing well is that people understand we are trying to run a different kind of campaign. Not one of personal attacks. One of dealing with the real issues facing the American people. And I'm not going to be engaged in personal attacks against Secretary Clinton or anybody else.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So, A.B.?STODDARD: I disagree David. Senator Sanders knows this is going to get wrap-around coverage all weekend long leading up to the caucuses. Senator Sanders has also seen the polling that her untrustworthy and dishonest numbers are terrible, and that's helping fuel his support among young people who don't trust her.BAIER: So he doesn't say --STODDARD: Right. And also, look, he has already attacked her for taking big speech fees from Goldman Sachs. It doesn't really get worse than that.CATANESE: You think he'll go at her --STODDARD: I don't know. I'm just saying, I don't know that he has to. And when you say Democrats don't care about it, I disagree, just because in the polling it shows that they really don't believe her.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"": Breaking tonight, the plane carrying vice presidential candidate Mike Pence just slid off the runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport and we just got exclusive video from inside of the plane. The very first images of what was going on at the aircraft carrying Governor Pence and the press pool slid down the tarmac unable to stop.Welcome to THE KELLY FILE, everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. You're looking at brand-new pictures of the moment a plane carrying the vice presidential nominee on the GOP ticket slid off the runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport on a rainy night here in Manhattan. In just a moment, we are going to hear from the FOX News producer who was on board that plane about the governor's actions, as this happened, he shot this exclusive video.But first we go to Trace Gallagher who is at the breaking news desk with what we know. Trace?  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: We should note Megyn, that the737 which touches down around 120 miles per hour, was according to that same producer Dan Gallo coming in kind of hot. He was on board the plane and then he says, it began skidding and to quote him, he says, ""It was the craziest landing he's ever experienced."" He smelled burning rubber before it finally came to rest in the grass at the end of the runway. We are told that Mike Pence then came to the back of the plane to see that everyone on board was okay.The planes we're talking about kind of use a combination of brakes and reverse thrusters. But one of the reasons you don't see 737s flying in and out of LaGuardia is because the runways are not that long. This runway is about 7,000 feet. That's about 3,000 feet shorter than you would find at Newark or JFK. Now, as a rule, 737s only need about 4,000 feet. But when you talk about rainy weather like they have tonight in LaGuardia, that clearly changes the math. It's hard to tell when you look at the pictures from which angle and which direction the plane came in.But remember, anybody who has flown in and out of LaGuardia knows they have water at the end of the runways. This plane slid only as far as the grass and the passengers stayed on the plane for about ten minutes before rescue teams arrive. They brought down the exit. Everybody walked off board. The Governor reportedly was traveling with campaign advisers, the media as we said as well as his wife and daughter. We're told that Donald Trump did reach out to Mike Pence and says that he's glad everyone on board is safe. There appears -- if you look at the plane, there appears to be some damage to the runway but no noticeable damage to the airplane itself. But this plane is not leaving for a while -- Megyn.  KELLY: Wow! Trace, thank you.Joining us now with more, Dan Gallo, he is the FOX News producer travelling with Governor Pence and he was on that plane and shot that video we've just been looking at together. Dan, thanks for joining us tonight by phone.So, was it obvious when the plane was landing that you were in trouble?DAN GALLO, PENCE CAMPAIGN PRODUCER (on the phone): Well, you know, I mentioned to some other people tonight that we've had some really interesting landings in this plane. I can't explain why they've been really rough landings. We've kind of gotten used to that. But this one felt like we were being pulled off to the side. And frankly, a sensation that I've never felt before in a landing. It didn't feel right. I don't know aircraft that well.I just knew that it didn't feel right but then again, I couldn't see much outside of the window of the plane so I couldn't really tell if we were in the grass, if we were going sideways on the runway or whatever. But it definitely felt like it was pulling to one side. And then it came to a really abrupt stop after it felt like they had been jamming on the brakes for the duration of the landing.  KELLY: And then like any good producer, you took your cell phone and started filming things once things settled down. You can see, there's certainly no panic on board the flight. What was the first you saw of Governor Pence?GALLO: I would say about a minute or two after landing. He walked back and asked if everyone was okay. And of course everyone was fine. I mean, we were all wearing our seat belts. If we hadn't been wearing our seat belts, it could have been a problem. But everyone was fine. He was walking away. I said Governor Pence, 2016 because it feels like this is all -- you know, everything else has happened in 2016, why not this.  KELLY: And so, were you -- did you have to go down the emergency slide to get out? How did you exit the aircraft?GALLO: No, no sliding. We waited for several minutes. We could see the emergency lights outside the window of the plane. Couldn't see a whole lot because the rain was kind of fogging up the windows of the plane. But yes, we walked down the stairs. Somehow they got stairs and we walked down where there was emergency personnel outside the plane.  KELLY: Great.GALLO: But yes, we walked down the stairs. Somehow they got stairs and we walked down with their emergency personnel out by the --KELLY: Great. So, everyone is okay, including the Governor, including you. Glad to hear it. As you say, Dan Gallo, 2016. We've experience in that too. Great to see you.  GALLO: I got some mud on my shoes after tonight.  KELLY: Great to hear from you. All the best to you.GALLO: Thank you.KELLY: Glad to hear everyone were all right.  Also breaking tonight, with just 12 days until Americans elect their next president, there is growing pressure on Hillary Clinton to respond to the latest leaked campaign emails. These notes detail the most lucrative time in Bill and Hillary Clinton's careers. The years after they left the White House and while Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state. A new WikiLeaks released revealing a memo written by Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band.In it, Doug Band details what he calls, quote, ""Bill Clinton, Inc."" An operation to enrich the Clintons by steering top tier corporations to donate to the Clinton charity and bank roll the Clinton's lifestyle. Even contributing millions to the Clinton family's personal fortune. We've got a big lineup for you tonight on 2016 including Charles Krauthammer. Filmmaker Michael Moore and Trump's spokesperson Katrina Pierson.But we begin tonight with Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry and the story behind Clinton Incorporated. Ed?ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good to see you, Megyn. After November 8th, some of the world's most influential corporations may still be pouring money into the Clinton's personal coffers. That is because while Bill and Hillary Clinton had promised to swear off new fundraising for the foundation if she's elected, this leaked memo suggests the door is wide open for millions of dollars in consulting fees to continue flowing to Bill Clinton even if his wife is president.Today on the trail, Donald Trump was all over the release of this damaging email detailing what you called Bill Clinton, Inc. That was not coming from Trump, that is coming from former Clinton confidant Doug Band. Now on the outs, after he alleged it was a strategy actually to steer donors for the foundation to hire Mr. Clinton for speeches and consulting. The 2011 memo revealing the plan, quote, ""Yielded more than $30 million for him personally with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years, meaning it could continue from 2011 to 2020 or the end of his wife's first term if she's in office unless of course there's public pressure and Bill Clinton is forced to sever some of those contacts.Now, Band wrote the memo after Chelsea Clinton blew the whistle on allegations that his company Teneo was making money off of access to her father. He fired back, the foundation literally had about 500 conflicts of interests. He further alleged the former president was collecting money from at least three sponsors of CGI, the Clinton Global Initiative and accepted personal gifts as well. The Clinton camp is so far refused to even acknowledge the authenticity of these WikiLeaks e-mails but the company Band co-founded did confirm the accuracy of this memo though they insist tonight Teneo never benefited financially from the charity -- Megyn.KELLY: Uh-huh. Ed, thank you. The question tonight is how much does this stunning new information reinforce some of the worst perceptions of Hillary Clinton. And how much does it matter? Just 12 days away from the election.Tom Bevan is a co-founder and publisher of RealClearPolitics.com. Bill Burton is a former Obama White House deputy press secretary. And Monica Crowley is a FOX News contributor. Great to see you, all.Monica, let me start with you on those two questions.  MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Megyn, we know that the most problematic scandals for any candidate are the ones that reinforces a preexisting negative notion about that person. The problem for Mrs. Clinton is that these constant WikiLeaks disclosures remind voters of 30 years of Clintonian corruption and it also reinforces a sense of pure exhaustion that most people feel when exposed to the Clintons for any length of time.When you're getting these constant WikiLeaks drip drip drip of pay to play and the idea that Mrs. Clinton leveraged her public office as secretary of state to enrich herself, her husband and their foundation, I think it really tells voters, that it gives them a glimpse of the past, what we experienced first of all with the first Clinton presidency and a glimpse of the future in terms of what a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. And that's not a good look for her.  KELLY: The thing is Bill, it makes it sound like that Bill Clinton was getting rich as he solicited donations for his charity. It was like a little for the charity and what about Bill. Hey, here I am. Right? And she's not even promising to shut this thing down, you know, if she becomes president.BILL BURTON, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Megyn, first of all, we can't let this conversation get too far down the tracts about saying --KELLY: Russia!BURTON: -- Russia is trying to have an impact on our election --KELLY: I know. I know. We've been told.BURTON: They want these documents.KELLY: Right. It's bad, bad.  (CROSSTALK)BURTON: Oh, yes. Russia is not any good. Putin wants Donald Trump to be president. That's why this is public to begin with.  KELLY: It is true. That is all true and valid. Let's talk about it.  BURTON: Yes. Second point, at this point in the election voters are voting, 10 million voters have voted. The rest of the voters in the final days here are trying to decide who is the best person to be commander-in- chief. If you look at this news and you're a Trump supporter, it reinforces what you already thought about the Clintons. If you're a Clinton supporter, you think, hey, whatever, enough with all of the WikiLeaks.For the folks in the middle, they're trying to decide who is going to be the best commander-in-chief. This is not going to have any impact whatsoever on whether or not people think that Hillary Clinton should or should not be the commander-in-chief. Donald Trump is running out of paths to 270 electoral votes and this does not create a new one for him.  KELLY: All right. Let's pick it up there, Tom, with you on the polling and whether you agree that Donald Trump is running out of path to 270. Because the Trump camp believes they have momentum. The Fox News poll that just came out shows her leading only by three, and shows her lead shrinking, and shows his standing with Independents getting better and his standing with Republicans getting better as well.TOM BEVAN, PRODUCER, REALCLEARPOLITICS.COM: Well, look. I agree with Bill that Trump is behind right now and certainly has a lot of ground to make up. But where I would disagree with Bill, is that, look, this is, you know, those voters in the middle are trying to decide, right, and this reinforces all of the worst perceptions. Whenever the, the one thing we know about this election is, whoever is under the spotlight suffers. Clinton is now under the spotlight because of this.And the other thing is that, you know, one of the things that Hillary Clinton had going for her over the last couple of weeks, is she had people, her base rallying to her, these Millennials who were sort of iffy on her a little bit. This kind of revelations, this kind of news might dampen the enthusiasm for some of those softer Clinton voters and that won't help her in the end either.  KELLY: What about that, Monica? Because there was a report today that that's part of Trump's game plan is to dampen enthusiasm and actually suppress voter turnout from the key groups that she needs. Will this help?CROWLEY: Yes. I mean, Mrs. Clinton has had a difficult time with voter enthusiasm for her and on her side. So, this certainly does not help. We've got a group of about 10 to 20 percent of undecideds. That's the target that both sides are going for a certainly Donald Trump needs that group of undecideds. So, if you're Mrs. Clinton and her campaign, Megyn, tonight, you have to be worried that these kinds of disclosures are chipping away at them --  KELLY: Yep.CROWLEY: -- and they're just saying, and I hear this refrain over and over again. I cannot do the Clintons again. I can't do it.  KELLY: Bill, I'll give you the final word. Do you agree that, I mean, there may be chipping. But could there be enough chipping that it actually threatens her lead whether it's three points or ten points depending on which poll you look at.  BURTON: No. There's no poll in America that shows 10 to 20 percent undecideds. This race is cooked. And I don't think that anything about these new documents that Vladimir Putin wants American voters to see are going to shift those few undecided voters to make Donald Trump president. It's just not going to happen.  KELLY: So, it's a weird thing. So, you know, they are hacked. You feel a little uncomfortable. Because it's a valid point that they're hacked and we just sort of go ahead and cover them. But everybody is covering them and they've become a major political story. So, anyway, it's important to have the reminder, so Russia, Putin bad and then we proceed. Great to see you all.Lots of news still ahead tonight, including Charles Krauthammer and what we just learned about Trump's future plans for the Republican Party.Plus, Mr. Trump was today telling supporters to go watch a film by Michael Moore. What the heck is going on here? We have an exclusive tonight with the filmmaker. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, 12 days out from Election Day. Twelve. And Donald Trump along with key members of his team are pointing people to a clip from a brand-new documentary by progressive filmmaker Michael Moore. What? Here is the part they want to share. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he's saying the things to people who are hurting. And it's why every beaten down nameless forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump. He is the human Molotov cocktail that they've been waiting for. They've essentially lost everything they had except one thing. The one thing that doesn't cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution, the right to vote.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: But the story does not end there. In moments, we will speak with Michael Moore.But first Trace Gallagher is in our Los Angeles newsroom with the story behind this strange political alliance. Trace?GALLAGHER: Megyn, during the speech that appears in his new movie, ""TrumpLand,"" the liberal filmmaker explained to an audience in Willington, Ohio about why is it that Donald Trump has more support than people think. More talk about Trump's appeal. He even defended Trump supporters who he once called legal terrorists. Michael Moore is not a Trump fan but he makes a compelling case about why some people are. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MOORE: Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The media hates Trump. Yes on November 8th, you Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Billy Blow, Billy Bob Blow, all of the blows get to go and blow up the whole God damn system because it's your right. Trump's election is going to be the biggest (bleep) you ever recorded in human history and it will feel good.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: The video has gone viral among Trump supporters with both Donald Trump and Donald Jr. applauding it. Trump, Sr. writing, quote, ""I agree Michael Moore to all Americans, I see you and hear you, I am your voice, vote to drain the swamp with me on November 8th."" Political experts say, it appears the filmmaker is genuine in his warning that voters who are currently or formerly in the middle class have been forgotten and that for them the vote for Trump would be the ultimate FU.But this apparent owed to Trump is without context as Michael Moore himself points out on Twitter, quoting, ""Hey everyone, Trump Jr. and the right wing thinks my movie called TrumpLand is pro-Trump. Ha ha. Please don't tell them otherwise. Righties have doctored clips from my film to make it look pro-Trump. 7.9 million views sending millions to iTunes, TrumpLand #1."" For the record, the viral clip wasn't doctored. It simply left off this part. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MOORE: Like the Brits who wanted to send a message so they voted to leave Europe only to find out that if you vote to leave Europe you actually have to leave Europe.(LAUGHTER)And now they regret it. All the Ohioans, Pennsylvanians, Michiganders and Wisconsinites, a middle England, right? They all voted to leave and now they regret it.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: No question with this trolling Michael Moore gin up support for his film. Big question of whether he ginned up support for Trump -- Megyn.  KELLY: Trace, thank you. Joining us now, the man behind Michael Moore in ""TrumpLand,"" documentary filmmaker and bestselling author Michael Moore. Michael, great to see you again.  MOORE: Thanks for having me on.  KELLY: So, the real zinger at the end of this clip is, you say that everybody when they vote for Trump, they're going to find out after few months in office that President Trump wasn't going to be a damn thing for them. It will be too late to do anything about it. You've done it. You've send the message. Good night, America. You've just elected the last president of the United States. What does that mean?MOORE: That means that -- well, first of all, when I said doctored, they cut me off after I said it will feel good after you vote for him.KELLY: Uh-huh.MOORE: The next line is for day --KELLY: Uh-huh.MOORE: Maybe a week. But when you find out that your life isn't going to get any better under President Trump and probably will get worse, that's when you're going to realize what the Brits have realized now.  KELLY: That whole thing is the wind up to your ultimate hit --MOORE: Yes, the wind up.KELLY: That you're being duped. That is your argument.  MOORE: Yes.  KELLY: But why? And what do you mean he'll be the last president? He's going to blow up the world, is that what you're saying?MOORE: I don't, I mean, what I'm saying is, if we elect Donald Trump as president of this country, it won't be the same country after four years. I'm absolutely convinced of that. This is the most vile disgusting candidate that has ever run for office in this country.  KELLY: How can you say that when you, you know, you understand the white working class.MOORE: Yes.KELLY: You know, you appeal to them time and time again.MOORE: Yes.KELLY: You understand. You outline perfectly why they're attracted to him. They want him to blow things up.MOORE: Yes.KELLY: As you say, he's a human Molotov cocktail.  MOORE: Right. So, I'm here and I'm here on Fox to appeal to people who are watching to not do that. I understand why you're angry. You have every right to be angry. The system has failed you. But he is not the solution to this. And I make the case in the film -- the film is sort of a humorous love poem to Hillary Clinton. Because --(LAUGHTER)KELLY: I can hear the ticket sales now.  MOORE: Yes. Well, it's been number one on iTunes since last Friday.  KELLY: Thanks to Trump.  MOORE: Yes. Well, it was number one until ""The Walking Dead"" took over, then the living dead.(LAUGHTER)Trump started pushing it. Because he didn't have -- obviously, they didn't watch the movie.KELLY: Yes.MOORE: If he had watched the whole movie, he and Don, Jr. wouldn't be promoting this because the movie says, get out there and vote for Hillary Clinton.  KELLY: He tweets out, this is Donald Trump, I agree, Michael Moore. I agree, he says. And Donald Jr. says, Michael Moore gets this one 100 percent right.  MOORE: Yes.KELLY: But you've said, you know?MOORE: So, obviously he didn't watch the movie because it tells everybody --KELLY: Right. Well, he's a busy man.MOORE: Okay.KELLY: You speak about the people in Ohio, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin. And in your piece, you talk at how they lost their jobs, they lost their homes, they had a divorce. Now the wife and kids are gone. The car has been re-oped, they haven't had a real vacation in years. They're stuck with the crappy Obamacare Bronze Care. They can't even get an effing Percocet.MOORE: Uh-hm.KELLY: They want change and they don't see it in Hillary Clinton.MOORE: Uh-hm. Well, they should. Because she will make this better. She's the proponent of universal health care, she's been that way for 25 years. And that is what's going to -- Obamacare will get better under her. Remember, the real problem about Obamacare is not the Obama part of it. It's the private insurance companies are still calling the shots. They get to raise these rates. There's no control like there is over Medicare and things that the government has to stay in. Obamacare was only a halfway measure. We'll get the rest of it under Hillary Clinton. She's going to do so many things, to raise the minimum wage, she's going to do things that will help equality for women.  KELLY: You like her so much. Why were you against her when she ran against Obama and you were against her in the primary?MOORE: Yes.KELLY: You liked Bernie. You seem to be a reluctant Hillary supporter, am I wrong?  MOORE: Yes. I wasn't reluctant. She voted for the war, I thought she was too cozy with Wall Street. I supported Bernie, I supported Obama years ago but --  KELLY: What about all of the Wikileaks disclosures, do they bother you?MOORE: No, not at all.  KELLY: You don't care about the Clinton cash?MOORE: I care about women should be paid the same as men, I care about the polar ice caps melting, I care about the big big issues.KELLY: Uh-huh.MOORE: And those are the ones you have got to have the smart person in the room. And I may not agree with her on all of these issues, that is not really the point anymore. The point is, is that, we have a choice between somebody who is smart, who has a heart, who's going to stand up for kids and for families and for working people and we have a billionaire who just says these things trying to pretend that he cares. And just the con with me right now, just the con where they've taken a piece of my movie and put it out only half of that little clip --KELLY: Do you think it's knowing? Do you think it's knowing? Or it's just an error that they haven't --MOORE: Well, there is no error. No. It's either they're dumb and I honestly don't think they are. Or they know they're --KELLY: That they're misleading?MOORE: Dumb like a Fox maybe. They're misleading people because they're counting on the fact that people who are in the working class are so desperate and so hurt by what has happened to them that all they'll do is hear those few words and not hear the rest of my paragraph.  KELLY: But even before you articulated very well how they feel, they were with Donald Trump. He's beating her by 33 points with the white working class.  MOORE: Yes.  KELLY: Thirty three points. I mean, it's huge. They are attracted not just to the messenger but to the message too.  MOORE: Yes. That's sad. Really sad.  KELLY: And you know how they feel. This is the way that many Republicans and what we know about these folks is many of them feel like disenfranchised Republicans is they're sick and tired of people talking down to them and telling them that they're stupid to understand what's good for them.MOORE: Right. Exactly. Exactly. And they're not irredeemable. No human being.KELLY: They're not deplorable. And they are not all racists.MOORE: Racists are deplorable. But you're right.KELLY: Right.MOORE: They're not -- no human is irredeemable.  KELLY: Michael Moore thinks he is smarter than me. He is basically telling me, I am stupid to realize, I shouldn't support Trump. Well, I get it. I've been watching Trump. And they're saying, I love him. I don't care what Michael Moore is trying to --MOORE: And what I'm saying is, I understand you've been abused and I'm here in Ohio to conduct an intervention, to basically to say that sometimes abused people have a hard time making the right decision because of the abuse and the attack on the working class has been so intense over the last couple of decades that I understand why there's a lot of confusion here. And Trump is a huge ball of confusion in this. And it seems like he's going to be your human hand grenade that you're going to get to toss in there.When phrase point out there about the legal terrorists. It's actually what I said was, is that there is a legal way on November 8th to do what Trump says he is going to do, blow up the system. You can participate in that by going in there and handed the hand grenade to Donald Trump. I think that is a risky proposition, I think it's a dangerous thing to do. And I think that you're not going to be better off with this billionaire who's never spent a day in his life worrying about you, carrying about you, doing anything for you.  KELLY: They see it and they find out that it's not a pro-Trump film, you know, they're smart enough to realize, this is information, I'll take this point of view and I'll make up my own mind as they will do in --  MOORE: Yes. But I already -- he's lied to them and I will already have their five bucks and I want to give it back to them.  KELLY: Go for it.  MOORE: I don't know how to do that.  KELLY: You can give it to me and I'll make sure they get it. Promise.(LAUGHTER)Okay. I have to go. Michael Moore, pleasure as always.MOORE: Thanks for having me on.KELLY: Also tonight, with early voting under way. Trace Gallagher has new details on reported problems at the voting booths.  Plus, Donald Trump just wrapping up a rally in Ohio tonight. And we'll show you how close the polls are now running in that critical state when we come back right after this break.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, Donald Trump just wrapped up a rally in Ohio where he spoke briefly about the incident in New York where a plane carrying vice presidential candidate Mike Pence slid off the runway at LaGuardia. There were no injuries. Mr. Trump said he spoke with Governor Pence, everyone was okay. He was glad to hear that. Earlier today the Republican nominee hit the big towns of Springfield, Toledo and Geneva with an anti-Obamacare message all as his lead looks more and more like statistical tie.Trump and Clinton neck in neck now there, now separated by just one point in Ohio. Mrs. Clinton was campaigning in North Carolina today where she appeared together with first lady Michelle Obama for the first time in this campaign. They've never been out together. While the first lady never mentioned the Republican nominee by name, she never does but it's clear who she was talking about. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA, UNITED STATES FIRST LADY: The choice we face between those who divide this country into us versus them and those who tell us to embrace our better angels and choose hope over fear.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Trump campaign national spokesperson Katrina Pierson and host of ""The Filter"" on SiriusXM Progress and DNC Platform Committee member Nomiki Konst, good to see you both. Katrina, what do you make of Michelle Obama? Is she effective out there? Is a threat to the Republican ticket?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: I don't think she's a threat but I do think she is effective. She's very popular, well liked in her party and that's exactly why that Hillary Clinton is having to prop her up because Donald Trump's plane sitting idle on a tarmac gets more live stream viewers than Hillary Clinton rallies. But more importantly, what was interesting about this particular event is Hillary Clinton opened for Michelle Obama and that was startling.KELLY: And Hillary Clinton had more people there, 11,000 than she ever gets at her rallies by herself.NOMIKI KONST, POLITICAL ANALYST: Sure.KELLY: So what does that say?KONST: Well, listen, Hillary Clinton is still beating Donald Trump in every single major poll so it says a lot that she doesn't have to be taking the front seat and Michelle Obama is the most powerful figure...KELLY: So, she was just being kind.PIERSON: Absolutely. Michelle Obama, let's be fair. She's the most popular political figure in America today.KELLY: More so than Hillary Clinton?KONST: She's not running for office. Michele Obama gave a rousing speech. It does not always happen in campaigns. When Hillary Clinton is not campaigning her popularity goes up but she's still beating Donald Trump and that's what we need to pay attention to.KELLY: Katrina, the articles out today -- this is from ABC talking about how Clinton is ramping up her surrogate operation and Trump -- Trump's withers is the headline, talking about how Ben Carson, Newt Gingrich, Chris Christie, they all used to be much more visible on the campaign trail than they are right now and the suggestion is that either Trump has decided they're not good or these guys see a ship that is sinking and are trying to run off of it.PIERSON: Or maybe cable news feels like they know what's going on. Our surrogates have been deployed to swing states because that's where this race is going to be won. They're in Florida, they're in Ohio, they're in Pennsylvania and that's what they're doing.KELLY: Ben Carson, he is?PIERSON: They are definitely campaigning for Mr. Trump.KELLY: Chris Christie?PIERSON: I'm not sure what Chris Christie is doing right now, but I do know the other surrogates are out there. But I will say, is just because they're not on cable news every day, it doesn't mean that they're not out there campaigning. And again, Hillary Clinton brought up Michelle Obama. Hillary Clinton is supposed to headline her own event and she can't do it because 30 percent of the people of this country still says she's dishonest.KELLY: These surrogates are making appearances here and there but they've gone down, that's the truth. You see far less of these guys than you seen before and so you tell me whether the Trump campaign has reached the conclusion that they're not helping him and you know, in his defense, he doesn't have anywhere near a surrogate like Michelle Obama.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely.KELLY: There isn't one on the GOP side for him. It's all -- it's the Trump show. It's the Donald Trump show, and he doesn't need -- you know, nobody else can draw the crowds that he can draw. But he's only a man and he can only be in so many places at one time. So you tell me why these surrogates are taking a little role.KONST: I think that they can read the statistics. They can read the numbers. Even Trump's own campaign, which uses this -- they spend $100,000 a week on a data statistics simulation model that will basically simulate what it will look like on Election Day and it reflects some of the most sophisticated modeling out there. They even know internally that he is down. It is pretty much impossible for him to win. The only way he can win, he has to win Florida. No matter what, he has to win Florida and that's his only path to victory.KELLY: It's tight in Florida.KONST: It's very tight, but that's his only path to victory and it's very narrow. You look at a place like Ohio where voter -- early voting is up 23 percent compared to 2008 and 2012 for Democrats right now. Every single simulation on the Democrat side shows that even though it's supposed to be a state where he has to win as well, Democrats are doing well with early voting. So I think all the surrogates get the message and they're thinking about their political future.PIERSON: Except for the fact that the Trump campaign is actually up in early voting in Florida as well as Ohio and winning in the polls as of today in both of those states. It's going to be a close race. But at the same time, Donald Trump's rallies bring in 20 to 25,000 people and that doesn't include the 132,000 who take time timeout out of their day to go to their computer and live stream his events.KELLY: Got to ask you quickly, what did you make of Michael Moore's criticism that the Trump campaign has sliced his sound bite? I mean, at the end of that bit, he's very critical of Donald Trump. He does not support Donald Trump. And you've got Trump tweeting out, ""yeah, Michael Moore is right.""PIERSON: Because he is right. We do see the working class out there supporting Mr. Trump. And even though Michael Moore is anti-Trump, he's talking about being divisive. Donald Trump hasn't been out there calling people deplorables and irredeemable. He's not out there criticizing Catholics for wanting to baptize their kids. He's not calling...KONST: He's alienating every single ethnic group that's not his own white working class.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Individuals, not broad groups of people. There's a major difference.(CROSSTALK)KONST: But he's trying to suppress them and that's what we have to keep in mind to.(CROSSTALK)PIERSON: He's definitely not suppressing anyone.KELLY: Well, that was documented in the article that he apparently cooperated with -- the Trump team cooperated with Bloomberg. But I got to leave it at that.PIERSON: Unnamed source and not verified.KELLY: Well, it was the social media guy who's running the whole thing. He was talking on the record to them. All right, I got to leave it at that. I got to go. That's next in part. Great to see you both. Charles Krauthammer on what we just learned about Mr. Trump's future plans for the Republican Party.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, we are tracking new fallout from an eye opening look into the inner workings of the Trump campaign. The story comes from Bloomberg Media and it details how Trump's team is collecting data on the businessman's millions and millions of supporters -- information that Trump can leverage in the future whether he wins the White House or not.Campaign chairman Steve Bannon saying, ""...what he's built is the underlying apparatus for a political movement that's going to propel us to victory on November 8 and dominate Republican politics after that."" The Trump's digital director adding to that saying, ""We knew how valuable this would be from the outset. We own the future of the Republican Party.""Joining us now, Fox News contributor and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Charles, good to see you. So, this is basically a look at what the future of Donald Trump and his supporters is, win or lose. Let's start with win. If he manages to win on November 8th, is Republicanism now officially Trumpism, and what does that mean for the so-called mainstream Republicans like you, you know, like Rich Lowrie?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think it's quite -- I mean, if you win the presidency, essentially you reshape or you shape your party. The Republicans were not as strictly completely conservative, unconflicted conservative party. Before Ronald Reagan they had a very strong northeast liberal wing. Reagan comes in and the party has been changed irrevocably.If Donald Trump wins, he's not a conservative. He's populist and he will have a little more resistance than Reagan did because he was in tuned with the general zeitgeist of the party, but Trump will dominate There will be resistance from sort of the old style, more Reagan-like conservatives. But I think if you're president especially if you succeed in the presidency, meaning you win re-election or you have strong popular support like Reagan did, you set down the rules for a few decades.KELLY: And so, what if the opposite happens? Trump loses but he still has so much influence in this Bloomberg media article points out that he's spending $100,000 a week on data collection and figuring out who's with him. And they've described the audience that they've built -- what they built -- disenfranchised new Republicans who are younger, more populist and rural and also angry, active and fiercely loyal to Donald Trump.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, you saw that in the primaries, you see it now. Remember Trump said I could go down 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any supporters. That's essentially what's happened -- through thick and thin, through the ""Access Hollywood"" tapes which would have sunk anyone, a lot of other things before that.KELLY: But where do they go, I mean, what do they do with that loyalty when he's no longer running for office?KRAUTHAMMER: That will depend on him. He has himself a plurality of Republicans, not a majority as we said in the primaries, but he's got a sizable chunk larger than anybody else's. So the question is what does he want to do with it? Is he going to be (inaudible) or George Washington to ride away into the sunset? If you lose a presidential election in American history, especially modern American history, you're gone.You know, there's no Mondale, there's no Dukakis. You have your chance, you lose, you don't show up again. That would be different with Trump. He sort of created, well, he discovered his own constituency. They feel they have nowhere else to go. If he does not walk away, then he can do a lot with the constituency particularly as we saw in the Bloomberg article if he has the mechanics, if he owns the data. If he has a way to email and to reach all of them and even if he doesn't, he can simply use Twitter or Facebook.So, he can shape it into a movement either to run again for re-election to influence the midterm elections, to influence the current politics. If Trump decides to stay in the game, the first test will be whether he can successfully bring down Paul Ryan who has become a nemesis of his and then we'll know how transitive is his influence.KELLY: Right, because if you look at what happened with John McCain, of course he went back to the U.S. Senate. But Mitt Romney, you know, he didn't really -- for a while he was considered, you know, a Republican leader but his influence has definitely diminished, and the question is whether the same thing would happen to Trump.And you're saying it depends on Trump, but all along he says, look, if I lose, this is all for nothing. It has been a complete waste of time and I'm going to go back to running my successful business and, you know, focus on profit making. So, it's really up to Trump. We've speculated a lot about Trump TV and whether he wants to build a media empire, but it's up to Trump and we're really unsure if he loses this thing whether that's something he has any interest in as opposed to building buildings, licensing on his name and doing all the other things that have made his company, you know, what it is.KRAUTHAMMER: But we know one thing from his entire life history, he loves the spotlight, he finds it hard to be away from it. And even though he said at the beginning, if I lose, you know, I'll go back to my old life, I don't think, well, I don't know. He'll decide. But I think it is likely he will not -- he'll be changed and he will have acquired a powerful instrument, a political instrument. He didn't have that before he ran and he can use it.He could use it commercially, for example, with a TV station or a TV network or some other use in the media or he can do it politically in which case he mobilizes his people to influence elections and perhaps his own later on. It's extremely tempting because he built this essentially on his own and out of nowhere and he's got a lot of options. He's not the retiring type, you might have noticed.KELLY: Well, I mean, even if Trump doesn't win on November 8th, he has acted as a voice for a large, you know, large numbers of people who feel disenfranchised and we'll see whether Trump chooses to use that power to continue giving them a voice. He'd much rather do it from the oval office and he may yet do that too.KRAUTHAMMER: And we will see -- we will see if the so-called establishment is able to recognize the power and the needs of that constituency and to alter its policies to accommodate them. That I think would go a long way as well in determining how this constituency is responded to.KELLY: Charles Krauthammer, great to see you. Thank you.KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure.KELLY: Up next, with early voting underway, Trace Gallagher has new details on reported problems already at the voting booths. Stay tuned.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can a touch screen switch a vote?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People say that they can. I've never seen it do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Breaking tonight, I just want to update you on the fact that Governor Mike Pence and his plane was taken off the runway as they tried to land tonight at LaGuardia Airport. No one was hurt. Donald Trump has already tweeted out and responded saying he's glad everyone was okay. And now we've learned that Hillary Clinton tweeted out that she was glad to hear Governor Pence's staff and the plane crew were all safe after that plane slid off the runway. Again, no injuries tonight.Also this evening, new reaction to early voting problems in Texas already. Long lines for early voting across the Lone Star State. Now we're hearing reports of problems with voting machines. Trace Gallagher has the details live from our West Coast newsroom. Trace.GALLAGHER: Megyn, the controversy begun when some Texas residents who voted early posted stories on Facebook about voting machines flipping votes. Arlington resident Shandy Clark quoting here, ""Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton.She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that it had been happening."" But the post was shared some 200,000 times. Tarrant County election officials say a technician checked out the very same machine, even tried to recreate the problem but could not. And the woman who claims her vote was flipped, now admits she might have entered the wrong candidate.But that didn't stop Donald Trump from tweeting, ""A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. Big lines. What is going on?"" We should note Texas governor Greg Abbott is reminding Texas residents to double-check their votes. The most reports of problems in Texas, but Georgia, Louisiana, Nevada, a few other states also reporting some glitches with their machines. Megyn.KELLY: Wow. Trace, thank you. We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: And let me tell you that the new studio is spanking. You are going to love it. It's got all of the bells and whistles. I mean all, you know, all you really need is the great Fox News team, but you're going to be a little dazzled by what they've busted, I mean, they've spent some money? I know.And it looks great and it's enabled us to have all of the people here at Fox who you've come to know and love and trust be on the set for you that night, to help you understand the results as they're coming in. And we'll have them all for you. So, thank you for watching the Fox News Channel.
