This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Factor Follow Up Segment"" tonight as mentioned in the ""Talking Points Memo"" some of Hillary's top aides have been interviewed by the FBI about the email case. We don't know if Mrs. Clinton herself will be called.What we do know is that some employees at the Justice Department, which runs the FBI, have helped Hillary Clinton out at least in campaign donations. Data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics says $75,000 donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign.With us now David Bossie, chairman of the board of Citizens United, a watchdog group. Is this a big deal?DAVID BOSSIE, CITIZENS UNITED: It is a big deal. I mean look, this just another piece of evidence. Look, Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General herself is a Clinton appointee by Bill Clinton. She owes her career to Bill Clinton.$75,000 doesn't sound like a lot of money but it's by key people in decision-making --O'REILLY: Miriam Vogel, associate deputy attorney general; Renata Hesse, principal deputy assistant general for criminal and civil operations; Brian Boynton -- these are big names, these are big guys and gals and they're giving thousands of dollars. But --BOSSIE: They're decision-makers. That's the most important thing. How can the American people have confidence in an impartial investigation?O'REILLY: Let me challenge that. It's the FBI that has to make the recommendation whether to prosecute or not. Ok?BOSSIE: Yes, sir.O'REILLY: It's the FBI.BOSSIE: Ok.BOSSIE: And they are not tainted any way that we know of. And Comey, the director came out today and said he feels pressured to wrap up the investigation. Good. Good. Because we need to know before we go to the polls what happened.But when you get into the Justice Department, that's a huge apparatus and they're American citizens. They have a right to donate to anybody they want. In fact a couple voted -- I mean a couple -- donated to Donald Trump like $500.BOSSIE: Sure.O'REILLY: So you are saying they shouldn't have anybody, any political donations?BOSSIE: Look, I think that it tinges the investigation. The American people are going to look at this and say was this an impartial investigation? Was it a thorough investigation? Was it fair?Hillary Clinton has to be called for by FBI for an investigation. If she is not, there is a problem with that.O'REILLY: That would be strange. But the American people are going to decide based upon what the outcome is. So she is not indicted and conservatives who don't like her are going to say it's tainted. You know that.BOSSIE: Look, what we want -- what conservatives want is impartial investigation. That's why Congress, which should be doing something and is not, we have been calling for them to do something. Look, Janet --O'REILLY: What about -- what about Comey? What about Comey -- do you trust him?BOSSIE: You know, I do. I knew Jim Comey back many years ago. He is a -- he is really the last voice --O'REILLY: He's an honest guy, yes.BOSSIE: -- he seems like he's a very squared-away individual and I trust him. But look, Janet Reno as much as she wanted to put on the facade --O'REILLY: That was a joke.BOSSIE: -- she was a joke but she appointed seven independent councils on the Clintons and their cabinet.O'REILLY: And none of them did anything.BOSSIE: But for a reason.O'REILLY: Yes, for a reason. She appointed them and they didn't do anything. Janet Reno was the worst attorney general in the United States' history.BOSSIE: Without question.O'REILLY: All right now, Facebook, same thing. Same thing. You heard about this Facebook shuts out conservative postings, all right, in favor of liberal postings. The guy who is in charge of that, Tom Stocky, apparently he and his wife gave $5,400 to Hillary Clinton.BOSSIE: Right.O'REILLY: Here is Tom. And I have been saying this from the jump on Yahoo and these other deliverers you can't find conservative opinion on them.BOSSIE: Without question.O'REILLY: Everybody goes, ""Oh, you are crazy it's an aggregate. It's this, it's that."" I go, ""Baloney. Those are human beings making this decision.""BOSSIE: No, this is false advertising. They are saying this is a mathematical algorithm.O'REILLY: Yes, baloney.BOSSIE: It is baloney. And this is what -- look, there is some whistle blower saying we stepped on conservative content and propped up liberal content and now this guy who is in charge of content is a Clinton donor.O'REILLY: Yes. Tom Stocky.BOSSIE: It makes it. It doesn't look very good for them.O'REILLY: And he looks like he is like 16 years old. Put his picture up there again. Really, when I saw this guy I thought they were remaking ""Leave It to Beaver"" and he was going to play Wally. But these guys -- they are in their 20s. They are young people.BOSSIE: Right.O'REILLY: Nobody is looking at them. There is no editor there. They can throw up what they want to throw up.BOSSIE: They can. It's a private company. They can do anything they want.O'REILLY: Right.BOSSIE: But the consumers -- conservatives have to understand that Facebook is not treating conservatives fairly.O'REILLY: I don't think Yahoo is and I don't know about Google. I don't go there very much. But I think that whole Internet is stacked against any kind of traditional conservative thought. Last word?BOSSIE: I just think Facebook needs to make sure that the American people -- their consumers -- liberals, conservatives, independents, understand that they're being treated fairly. And I don't think the evidence proves that right now. They have a long way to go.O'REILLY: Ok. Mr. Bossie, thanks you very much.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SHANNON BREAM, GUEST HOST:  Breaking tonight, new suggestions.  Donald Trump could be making the biggest gamble of his 2016 campaign.  The question now, will it pay off?  Welcome to ""The Kelly File.""  I'm Shannon Bream in for Megyn Kelly.  Next Wednesday, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will take part in a discussion that's being billed as the first joint candidate event of the general election.  It has been unsanctioned debate.  NBC's Matt Lauer will individually question them on national security, military affairs, and veterans' issues in what's being called the commander-in-chief forum.  It comes at a crucial time for Mr. Trump as some top generals have lined up behind Hillary Clinton, new ones today, raising questions about his support among the military ranks.  What's more, unlike the three official debates later this fall, there's no governing body for this forum.  And NBC is free to handle it any way they want.  Lieutenant General Michael Flynn served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  He is the author of the bestselling "" Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies.""   General Flynn will be with Donald Trump when he receives his second intelligence briefing tomorrow.  He would be advising the candidate on national security issues.  All right.  General --  GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN, FORMER DIRECTOR, DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY:  Wow!BREAM:  There's a lot going on.  FLYNN:  A lot going on.  BREAM:  A briefing is very important tomorrow obviously.  We talked after you had just come out of that first briefing and you felt that not only did Mr. Trump get all the information that he needed, you felt like he was ready to be the commander-in-chief.  Of course you know there are a lot of critics who will say, he is going against someone who has been a secretary of state, a senator, has been exposed to this kind of information, and has worked with countries around the world.  Why is he the better bet?FLYNN:  Yes.  I would just say just the ability to understand complex issues, to simplify complex things that are going on around the world.  And Donald Trump has been paying attention to what has been going on around the world for a long, long time.  And I will tell you over the course of this year, it has gotten into more and more detail as he's gotten closer to this point.  So I think that what I saw in the sort of the Q&A in that particular intelligence briefing that he received, it was a real -- I've seen thousands of those, Shannon.  So, and I was very comfortable with the conversation and the level of discourse, and frankly as I said at that time, that what was presented to him was in stark contrast to the policy decisions that are coming out of this White House.  So tomorrow will be interesting, and there's a set of topics that we've asked for.  So we'll see how that goes.  BREAM:  Okay.  Now, you were somebody obviously who has served our country.   I and millions around this country have got great respect for you.  FLYNN:  Thank you.  BREAM:  But when we hear Donald Trump say things like, I understand ISIS better than the General's do or I know more about ISIS than the General's do --  FLYNN:  Uh-hm.BREAM:  He doesn't know more than you.  FLYNN:  Yes.  I mean, and again, put it in the context of when it was.  So we were talking about, I think, almost a year later from that particular comment.  Where we are -- and I'm glad that you raised this thing that may or may not happen.  I don't know what the final result is going to be on this commander-in-chief forum next week --  BREAM:  Something it happened.  FLYNN:  Yes.  Or who is supporting Hillary Clinton versus who is supporting Donald Trump.  I think that what we will see is we'll see an individual in Donald Trump who is ready to serve today as the commander-in-chief.  I have no -- no problems with Donald Trump stepping up and understanding, again, the complexities.  And I describe them, Shannon, as the perils that the next president is going to face because the mess that has been left on the world stage in places like the South China Sea, North Korea, the Eastern European border of Ukraine where Russia is going through a massive, massive exercise right now, and just the utter disaster in the Middle East and parts of North Africa.  I mean that's what the next president is being left by the current -- this current administration, and that includes Hillary Clinton spending four years laying this thing on the world stage as a secretary of state.  So it's a mess.  BREAM:  Who do you think is taking the bigger gamble by showing up at this event next week?  They won't be on stage together, but they're both going to face tough questions.  There will be veterans and other military leaders in the audience asking questions.  Is it a bigger gamble for him or for her?FLYNN:  I think it's a much bigger gamble for her because she's not been out all that much.  So, you know, and I mean I'm sure she'll be prepared like everybody says she prepares very well.  But I think that what you've seen and what you've heard from Donald Trump over a year and his constant talking about the issues and talking about the world as it is today, the reality that we face and some of the threats that we face, I think actually he will be -- in fact I know, he's going to be much better prepared personally for Donald Trump to be able to address the issues that he's going to be asked about.  BREAM:  All right, General.  Thank you always for your service.  FLYNN:  Thank you, Shannon.  BREAM:  To this country.  Congrats on the book.  And we'd love to hear from you after the briefing tomorrow.  FLYNN:  Absolutely.  Thank you.BREAM:  All right.  And as we mentioned, Matt Lauer is going to be the one moderating next week's commander-in-chief forum.  And when that news broke, a number of conservative websites immediately starts questioning Lauer's role.  Trace Gallagher has that part of the story from our West Coast Newsroom.   Hey, Trace.  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Shannon.  During a one hour commander-in-chief forum, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as you say won't be on stage together, but instead will appear back-to-back.  And today show host Matt Lauer will moderate.  And that sparking conflict of interest concerns because Lauer once appeared on the Clinton Global Initiative website as a notable member.  The page has since been taken down, and NBC says, it never should have been up in the first place, saying, quoting, ""Matt Lauer was not and is not a Clinton Global Initiative member.""  It should also be noted that Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo was also listed as a CGI member and she too denies it.  But conservative critics have been pointing to media bias in this campaign ever since NBC News anchor George Stephanopoulos interviewed Hillary Clinton without disclosing that he had donated large sums of money to the Clinton Foundation.  ABC later apologized, and the GOP blocked Stephanopoulos from moderating a Republican presidential primary debate.  Now with the first of three presidential debates scheduled for September 26th, Donald Trump has said he won't appear if the moderators aren't fair.   The presidential debate commission, which picks the moderators, says the campaigns really don't get a say, but clearly the commission realizes what a delicate dance this is.  Consider that normally the commission announces moderators in mid-August, and now it won't be until at least next week.   For the record, a morning consult poll among registered voters has Anderson Cooper and Megyn Kelly topping the list of preferred moderators.   Presidential debates normally draw between 50,000,070 million viewers.   Experts say the September 26th debate could draw 100 million -- Shannon.  BREAM:  Uh-hm.  She gets my vote.  Trace, thank you.  Joining us now, Howie Kurtz, host of ""MediaBuzz"" on Fox News.  Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service.  He served as traveling press secretary on Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign.  And Guy Benson, Townhall.com political editor and a FOX News contributor.  Welcome all of you.  GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM POLITICAL EDITOR:  Hi, Shannon.  HOWIE KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"":  Hello.BREAM:  All right, Mo, I'll start with you because you saw we just had General Flynn on talking about this commander-in-chief thing that is coming up.  And he said, he thinks that his opinion, it's a bigger risk for Hillary Clinton because she's been part of this administration, which is leaving behind a lot of foreign policy stuff to deal with.  Your take.  MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY OF POLITICS:  You know it's interesting.  We're talking about veterans and the military, and historically if you look in politics, Republicans tend to do very well with that vote, with the military vote, with the veteran vote.  There seems to be something baked into people's psyche, into voters' psyche that if you have an R next to your name, you might be better on defense or veterans' issues.  And if you have a D next to your name, maybe on some other issues.  I think that calculus is scrambling a little bit in this election cycle in part because of some of the things that Donald Trump has said and done.  I think the fact that he went to war, rhetorical war with a Gold Star family and said that he gets his military advice from the shows has really kind of put him in a more tenuous position with a lot of voters who are concerned about national security and veterans' issues, much more so than any Republican nominee in recent history.  BREAM:  Yes, and today, Guy, he picked up two four-star generals' endorsements.  That is something we've seen, although Lieutenant General Michael Flynn said here that he's seen Mr. Trump evolve and get up to speed on these issues.  He is convinced he's ready to be commander-in-chief.  But some of those generals out there aren't, Guy.  BENSON:  Yes, and so each person is going to come out and give their various endorsements, and I think General Flynn made the case for Donald Trump.  And I don't necessarily agree that this is a bigger risk or gamble for either of them.  I think if you want to be president, if you want to be commander-in-chief, you need to be able to go through the gauntlet and answer these types of questions, which brings me to the moderator of this and sort of the controversy over Matt Lauer.  It actually doesn't really bother me that much because I think that at the end of the day, each journalist should be judged on his or her merits and their performance.  So whereas George Stephanopoulos, I think, is problematic on a few levels, Matt Lauer has the opportunity to show up and do a good job.  The key is transparency and disclosure.  If there's been any connection whatsoever with the Clinton Foundation or Clinton Global Initiative, that should be out in the open for viewers to know ahead of time.  That is crucial.  BREAM:  All right.  Howie, you are watching this all.  You know the players involved.  You know Matt Lauer, and we've seen him interview Mr. Trump before.  Certainly, you know, Hillary Clinton and interest with the Clinton Foundation now being questioned about his past.  Enlighten us a little bit on that.  KURTZ:  First of all, I think Matt Lauer has a pretty good track record of being tough on all political guests.  Donald Trump, who's complained to me about his past conflicts with CNN, MSNBC, FOX, ""New York Times,"" Politico, Washington Post, et cetera, has never said  a word about being unhappy with any of Matt Lauer's interviews.  And I think the whole Clinton Foundation thing is a non-controversy, never gave a dime and the foundation -- any journalist who was on the audience or something like that.  As far as the risk involved, the playing field and the subject might seem to favor a former secretary of state except for this.  Donald Trump has done about 5,000 interviews this year.  He's pretty well honed his skills at dealing with and deflecting these kinds of questions.  If anything, Hillary Clinton, who hasn't held a news conference all year and has given far few interviews might be a little rusty.  BREAM:  Yes.  About that, Mo, this is sort of a pre-debate debate.  It's not sanctioned.  We don't know exactly how they're going to handle it.   It's not going to be handled the same way as at official presidential debates.  Is it a bit of a warm-up for Mrs. Clinton who, it's been 271 days.  The last time that she held a press conference was before even a single primary vote had been cast.  That's a long time.  ELLEITHEE:  Yes, but this isn't -- this isn't a press conference, right?   This is more -- you're right.  We don't know what the structure is going to be.  And she has done -- she's done other one-on-one interviews both at the national level and the local level.  But having said that, look, you know, I think Howie is right, that Donald Trump has a lot of experience.  He does -- you know, he'll talk to anyone that will talk to him sometimes, it feels like.  But at the same time, you know, these are complex issues.  You know, and I think back to what General Flynn said a few minutes ago, that Donald Trump has the ability to simplify complex issues.  Some issues aren't simple.   Some of these complex international global issues that the commander-in- chief has to deal with aren't simple.  And Hillary Clinton is very well versed in these.  So I think the subject matter is going to provide a pretty stark contrast for voters to be able to choose between.  BREAM:  All right.  Guy, quick final word to you.  BENSON:  I think there's an expectations game at play here that's very important, and it goes back to what we saw with the Mexico trip.  Expectations for Trump are so low, when he exceeds them, he benefits.   Because of Hillary Clinton's pedigree and resume, her expectations, particularly on these issues, will be sky high.  BREAM:  Well, people were worried about that Mexico trip for him yesterday.   Pretty strong praise across the board, at least on the first half of the day.  That trip to Mexico.  We'll see how the commander-in-chief forum plays out.  Gentlemen, thank you very much.  BENSON:  Thank you.  BREAM:  Good to see you.  At this moment, a potentially life-threatening storm system quickly approaching Florida's Gulf Coast as that State braces for the arrival of Hurricane Hermine.  I think I'm saying it right but you can correct me, I am not sure.  We will bring you all the breaking developments on that.  Also ahead, was Donald Trump's immigration speech too aggressive even for those who support him?  Well, our next guests have worked closely with the Republican Party this cycle, and they have had enough, they say, with the Republican nominee.  Then Katrina Pierson is here with the campaign's response.  Stick around.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM:  Breaking tonight, you are looking at a live radar image of Hurricane Hermine -- I'm told that is the right way to say it -- as it inches closer to Florida's Gulf Coast.  An estimated 500,000 Florida residents are currently under a hurricane warning and bracing for the storm to hit landfall.  If the storm system maintains its strength, it will be the state's first hurricane since 2005.  Governor Rick Scott has declared a state of emergency.  All right.  Just hours after delivering what many call his toughest immigration speech yet, Donald Trump says he's actually softening his approach.  Last night, a doubling down on the border wall, a promise of no amnesty, and a vow to detain any illegal immigrants apprehended, ending the idea of catch and release.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We will build a great wall along the Southern border.  And Mexico will pay for the wall.  (CHEERS)There will be no amnesty.  Our message to the world will be this.  You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country.  Can't do it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM:  While Trump's speech sounded good to a lot of his supporters, the language was an issue with some of Trump's own Hispanic outreach team.   They were apparently expecting a different message because reports started circulating just hours after the speech that three from this group step down.  Here's RNC Chair Reince Priebus earlier tonight.   BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REINCE PRIEBUS, RNC CHAIRMAN:  Well, I think there may have been one person that was on one of the committees that may not be --  WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  We don't know, Reince, that at least three members of this Hispanic Outreach Advisory Council have told us that they've stepped down.  Did his campaign consult with your office of Hispanic Outreach ahead of the speech?PRIEBUS:  Listen, they communicate all the time.  I mean, I'm not -- I'm not tracking, Wolf, every communication and e-mail that comes in and out of the building, but we have a good relationship.  It's a solid relationship between both our Hispanic engagement operation and Donald Trump.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM:  Joining me now, two men potentially rethinking their Trump support.  Jacob Monty, a former member of Trump's National Hispanic Advisory Council, and Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the American Principles Project's Latino Partnership.  Gentlemen, we thank you both for coming on tonight.  ALFONSO AGUILAR, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN PRINCIPLES PROJECT'S LATINO PARTNERSHIP:  Thanks for having me.JACOB MONTY, FORMER MEMBER, TRUMP'S NATIONAL HISPANIC ADVISORY COUNCIL:  Good to be here.BREAM:  All right.  Jacob, it sounds like you have made your decision.   What was it that changed your mind, and will you be able to support Mr. Trump in any way?MONTY:  Well, let me say it's a tough decision because I realize that not supporting Donald Trump means that it's more likely that Hillary wins, right?  And Hillary is unacceptable.  Count me as a never Hillary person.  But I can't be part of his Hispanic Advisory Committee, and I can't support him anymore.  BREAM:  Let me ask you this, did you get a different sense of him because I know a couple of weeks ago there was a meeting.  You all were a part of that.  There were trickles after that saying, hey, listen, we really do think he's softened up.  We think that there is a good way forward here.  There were some who took that the next step and said, oh he's caving in on things like amnesty and that kind of thing.  But was there such a difference in what you heard in that private meeting and what you heard last night?  Is that what did it for you?MONTY:  Absolutely.  When we met with him on the 20th of August, he was prepared.  He was compassionate.  He was realistic.  He sounded like a businessman.  He acknowledged that the 11 million who are not criminals needed some accommodation, whether it was internal touchback or going back to their home countries quickly.  But none of that was in the speech.  And they built this speech up to be the seminal speech of the campaign on immigration.  And they did not deliver.  It was just populist propaganda taken from the talking points of fair and numbers USA and this aren't conservative groups --   BREAM:  All right.  Let me bring in Alfonso on this as well because I know that you said you took a big chance.  You really wanted to support Mr. Trump.  You kind of stuck your neck out here.  You say that you are not somebody who is going to support Hillary Clinton, but where are you today with regard to Mr. Trump?AGUILAR:  Like Jacob, I've withdrawn my support from Mr. Trump.  I wanted to support him.  I mean Hillary Clinton, for me, is not an alternative.  She will be disastrous for this country.  I'm concerned about the future of the Supreme Court.  I'm concerned about her economy.  I'm concerned about the dignity of the human person, the right to life.  She'll be disastrous in all those areas.  So we wanted to support Mr. Trump, and we were hoping that he would move to the center on immigration.  And it's not only that he was telling different people privately that he wanted to support some form of path to legal status.  Publicly he was saying that.  He said that he wanted to treat undocumented immigrants in a more compassionate and humane way.  And remember in town hall with Sean Hannity, he did say he was softening, and he did say that those people who were good and hardworking people who were here without documents, that we should find a way to regularize them inside the country.  Now, we waited.  We hoped that that speech was going to be constructive.  You know, we were sticking our neck out.  Because we were, I mean, just yesterday I was on this network, supporting Mr. Trump, hoping that he was going to support, be constructive on the issue.  And he gave a speech where he proposed a plan that is worse than what he has proposed initially.  It was a nativist plan, the message to undocumented immigrants, to all of them, even if they've been here for 20 years and are good, hardworking people, the message was, you know, you have to self-deport or we will deport you.  And if you leave, if you want to return, that is not guaranteed.  I mean, at the beginning, when he started his campaign, he was saying that the good people would leave, and they would reenter immediately.  That's something he said continuously.  Even that is off the table right now.  So at this point, I just can't support him.  BREAM:  All right.  Alfonso and Jacob, we thank you both for sharing your perspective with us.  We appreciate it.  AGUILAR:  Thank you.  MONTY:  Thank you.BREAM:  All right.  Now, here from the Trump campaign, Katrina Pierson, national spokesperson.  I want to give you a chance to respond to what they had to say.  They obviously sound to me wounded.  I mean, they feel -- it sounds like they feel betrayed by what they were privately promised and then what they heard on the stage last night.  The campaign cannot afford to lose the Hispanic support you do have.  So, how do you respond?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON:  Well, look, Mr. Trump has these meetings and he listens to everyone, and it's very important for him to have that input.  That doesn't necessarily mean they're making policy in these meetings.  This was Mr. Trump's policy from the very beginning, and it's truly unfortunate in American politics today that we have to remind people that the goal of the United States president is to do what's right for the American people.  And that's exactly what he's doing.  These policies are laws that are currently in place with the exception of giving ICE the priority to go and identify criminal aliens to deport them from this country, which is a good thing for our country.  And getting back on track.  We are at a stage where this is a Paul Revere moment here again in America.  Danger is coming.  Things are really out of control with immigration.  You have people who are paying upwards of 5, to 10, to $15,000 to come in legally.  It's not fair.  It's not fair to those who are doing things the right way.  But more importantly, it's not just about people coming into the country illegally.  This is about the cartels, this is about drugs, this is about ISIS, and terrorism.  This is not the 1980s anymore, and the president of the United States has to take into consideration the threats that we face today.  BREAM:  But what do you think about these folks who say, whether it's 10 million, 20 million, 30 million people, we don't know how many are here illegally.  They talk about families.  They talk about compassion.  They thought they were going to hear more of that.  And for them to now withdraw their support when they had publicly been out there for Mr. Trump and say, this is hurting people that I care about and that look up to me as a Hispanic leader, and now I just have to jump off the wagon.  PIERSON:  Well, I understand.  That's the softening.  Before it was just everyone as a whole.  Mr. Trump has put out a ten-point plan, and then we get to those who are non-criminally here, how we're going to address that because we have to enforce our current laws.  We're the only country that's not doing that, and we're suffering because of it.  When we look at our debt, when we look at our economic status, when we look at the health care costs, when we look at prison costs, we have to address this problem or we're going to be in serious trouble.  And Jacob and Alfonso, I know their hearts, I know where they rely.  But they also understand it's not about them.  It's not about me.  It's not about Mr. Trump.  It is about the future of the United States of America, and we have a clear choice in November.  We can continue down this path of more of the same, continuing to allow things to get completely out of control, and essentially kill the economy, or we can vote for someone who is going to have the best interests of the American people as a whole at heart.  BREAM:  Well, there are real economic and national security interests that are impacted by the situation that we have now.  PIERSON:  Absolutely.BREAM:  I think everybody can agree on that.  Katrina, good to see you.  PIERSON:  Good to be here.BREAM:  Thanks for coming on.PIERSON:  Thank you.BREAM:  All right.  Big news breaking in California tonight where the Governor may sign a bill that critics call one of the biggest threats to the First Amendment in years.  Dana Loesch is here on why this thing has whistleblowers in a sweat.  Plus, we'll investigate reports that the fed is about to take a bigger role in overseeing state elections.  Should they be?  That's next.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: With just 68 days to go until the election, there are new reports suggesting that the Department Of Homeland Security could take a big step toward granting itself greater authority over all of the country's voting systems. And that change could take effect before November 8th. We'll talk in moments with two of the legal experts worried about this development. But first Trace Gallagher has more on why this may be happening, Trace.GALLAGHER: Hey Shannon. What the Department of Homeland Security is suggesting is that voting is as important to our country's long-term security and prosperity as having a functioning electric grid, telecom networks and water treatment plants. So now, in the wake of cyber attacks on the Democratic National Committee and two state election databases, Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson is considering asking that the election be declared a quote ""critical infrastructure.In other words, DHS would consider measures to stop voting machines around the country from being hacked on Election Day. But we don't have just one federal election system. Instead, there are some 9,000 jurisdictions across America that tally votes. And as more voting machines become automated, the more vulnerable we are to being hacked, possibly changing the outcome of an election. Now, the White House has acknowledged the critical infrastructure designation for voting is getting a very hard look. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPJOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN: That's something that's being discussed by senior members of the president's national security team. We certainly will continue to work in coordination with state and local officials.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Just consider that during a 2012 pilot program aimed at testing online voting in Washington, researchers from the university of Michigan were able to hack into the government website so that every time a vote was cast, the Michigan fight song would play. Experts and some politicians say there is still a very big difference between the government saying it will secure online voting and actually doing it, Shannon.BREAM: All right, Trace. Thank you very much. My next two guests have some concerns about the federal government taking a bigger role in what is supposed to be an election process run by the states. I'm joined now by Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, John Yoo, former DOJ attorney and professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. Welcome to you both.ILYA SHAPIRO, SENIOR FELLOW IN CONSTITUTIONAL STUDIES CATO INSTITUTE: Good to be on.JOHN YOO, FORMER DOJ ATTORNEY: Thanks.BREAM: Right, Ilya, why should we care if the feds want to get more involved? They say they want to protect us. They want to make sure everything's OK. What are your concerns?SHAPIRO: Well look, there is no critical infrastructure clause in the constitution and anything the federal government does has to be based on constitutional authority. If the states want some sort of federal expertise or federal dollars for something, they might want to work that out. But the federal government, the Homeland Security Department or any other part of it can't simply come in and say, for your own good or for our own good we're going to take over this system.BREAM: Yeah, and professor, if I remember, back to law school, and I might have done some cheating and studying today, but Article 1, Section 4 as I recall, gives the states to control over how elections are handled, and there are a lot of people who worry about the concentration of power at the federal level and they're concerned about what they see maybe another power grab here.YOO: Yes, you're perfectly right, and you should have gotten an A in constitutional law because that's the exact provision at stake. The government may be right if it came to a critical infrastructure of electrical grids or communication networks. But on the issue of elections, there's a specific constitutional provision, Article 1, Section 4, that says the time, places and manners of elections are in the hands of the state legislatures.So, in this one area, the federal government cannot act unless Congress passes an actual law or the states request help. So, this is not like all those other critical networks that might be worth protecting because the states have a right guaranteed in the constitution to protect their control of the electoral system.BREAM: Well, Ilya, you know that -- we've seen plenty of exercises of executive power by this particular administration. You and I have talked and watched them be litigated many times at the Supreme Court. They're not shy about going around Congress when they don't think Congress is getting on board with what they want to do.SHAPIRO: Right. Again, it's when Congress won't act, we will -- somehow trying to arrogate to itself more and more power. And John, while you're fixing Shannon's transcript from law school, I hope you can do mine as well because look, this is not just simple, technical, academic-y stuff. The reason that -- there's good reason to have disbursed power over these sorts of things, if we have these 9,000 different kinds of election tallying system, well then hackers -- it's that much harder for them to control the election.If instead they can just hack into the back door of DHS, as has been done with DHS personnel files and take over the whole election, that's much more problematic than whatever perceived issue DHS has now the government is acting unconstitutionally potentially to intervene on.BREAM: And professor, I'll give you the final word here on how you think this shakes out.YOO: Well, I think or hope that the federal government, although I think it's a good idea to stop the Michigan fight song from ever being played.BREAM: Agreed.YOO: I think we can all agree on that no matter what law school we went to. But the important thing is that I agree with Ilya. The nature -- it's not just the technology, but the beauty of our constitution is creating a decentralized federalist government, and that means it's harder to attack for a hacker. It means our system is more resilient, but that's because it's hard wired into our constitution by our framers over 200 years ago.BREAM: All right gentlemen, very informative, and I would argue entertaining. Great to see you both.SHAPIRO: Thanks, Shannon.BREAM: Breaking tonight, for the first time in more than a decade, a hurricane is taking aim directly at the state of Florida. We've got the very latest on its track and when it is expected to make landfall.Plus reports that the Obama administration allowed Iran's secret exemptions in that Iran deal just as a way to meet their timeline. This all comes as a U.S. commander claims that Iran has been accelerating its harassment of U.S. sailors in the Persian Gulf. Marc Thiessen and Julie Roginsky are here. Stick around.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Breaking tonight, we're keeping close tabs on a hurricane that is now bearing down on the Florida Panhandle. The center of hurricane Hermine is expected to make landfall tonight or early tomorrow morning. When it does, it will be the first hurricane to directly hit the state since 2005. Right now winds have increased to nearly 80 miles an hour with higher gusts.The National Hurricane Center is warning it could strengthen even before making landfall, with millions of people across the southeast potentially in its path. Florida's governor is telling folks to stay away from the coast. They say this is a life-threatening situation.We've got new details developing tonight from a report that broke earlier today suggesting the administration secretly agreed to cut Iran some slack following the nuclear deal. Chief Washington correspondent James Rosen leads our investigation.JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good evening. David Albright, the renowned weapons inspector and nuclear analyst, head of the Institute for Science and International Security has issued a report first disclosed by Reuters charging that the joint commission established to oversee implementation of the Iran nuclear deal, a group comprised of Iran, the U.S., and the five other nations that negotiated the deal has been secretly weakening language relating to among other things Iran's storage limits on heavy water which can be used to develop weapons grade plutonium and caps on the regime's stockpile of low- enriched uranium or LEU.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)There are other stocks of low-enriched uranium that remain in Iran. It's in a uranium conversion plant. Now, the question is from Iran, can we exempt that too. And so, the joint commission formed a technical working group in July and one of their agenda items is whether this material will be exempt.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: The State Department pushed back against the Albright report telling reporters Iran's requirements under the nuclear deal have not been changed. The goal posts have not been moved.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: There has been no loosening of Iran's commitment, and there have been no exceptions given that would allow them to exceed the limits, whether it's the limits of LEU or the limits of heavy water that would allow them to have a usable amount of material.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: John Kirby kept repeating that certain phrasing, namely that Iran isn't being allowed to produce any additional nuclear material that could be used for a breakout dash for a nuclear weapon. Some in the briefing thought he was leaving a little bit of wiggle room there, namely that this joint commission that issues this secret guidance on how to implement the deal may have given some exemptions that allow Iran to produce more nuclear material that isn't immediately usable for such a breakout dash toward a nuclear weapon, Shannon.BREAM: James Rosen at the State Department, thank you. Joining us now Marc Thiessen, he is a Fox News contributor and former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush along with Julie Roginsky, she is a Democratic analyst and Fox News contributor. Great to see you both.JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you Shannon.BREAM: Julie, how come it is the more that we learn about this Iran deal, I mean the sketchier it sounds to be? These are things that are coming out or trickling out. It's one thing after another, and we have lawmakers on the hill saying they never even got the full briefing on exactly what was in it. We're getting new stuff every day.ROGINSKY: You know, those of us who supported this deal did it with a tremendous amount of misgiving, so it was a hope and understanding that this would prevent Iran from going nuclear in the next decade. If there are exemptions, not exceptions -- I want to be very precise about what Admiral Kirby said, but exemptions being granted to Iran after the deal were sealed, that to me is a very troubling development because it says that we continue to negotiate with Iran when the negotiations should have been over by now.And so for those of us who detest the Iranian regime understands this was never going to alter their behavior in any way outside of the potential ability to go nuclear in the next decade. It continues to be troubling because really, once you have this deal, the room for negotiation, especially on the Iranian part, should be over.BREAM: Well, and Mark, there were a number of Democrats who stood up on the hill and said publicly that they would not support this. They were vocal and had questions about exactly what they were getting into as well, and now they're speaking out. This isn't just a partisan issue for people. In the meantime, we've given them $1.7 billion to use as they see fit, and they're now harassing our military personnel. What gives?THIESSEN: Absolutely. I mean and I feel for Julie and some of the other Democrats who came out and defended this because there's just more and more trickling out. I think what was happening here, Shannon, is that the nuclear deal was in danger of unraveling entirely because what was happening was on the day of implementation, January 16th, Iran was going to be out of compliance with the deal.They had not given up their low-enriched uranium and some of the other things in this side agreement. And if they were out of compliance, then they wouldn't get the sanctions relief. And if they didn't get the sanctions relief, Iran was threatening to pull out of the deal entirely. And then on top of that, on January 16th, that was the day that the secret plane with $400 million of ransom money in exchange for American hostages was flying.BREAM: Not a ransom. Not calling it a ransom.THIESSEN: So all of these -- it was a ransom. And so all of these were happening on January 16th, and if they were not in compliance on that day, the whole thing could fall apart. So what the Obama administration did was they blinked. They allowed the Iranians to get some exemptions from this so that the thing didn't fall apart on day one because they were more concerned with preserving the perception of Iranian compliance than enforcing actual Iranian compliance.BREAM: Julie, did we get played?ROGINSKY: You know, if the scenario Marc just laid out -- there's a big if attached to it. If the scenario is correct then yeah, I mean, not that we got played, but we did blink as Marc said. You know, again, I want to be clear. There is no evidence that they're confirming that there are exemptions. But if there are exemptions, then Marc is absolutely right.We did get played. And again, I have to keep saying the only reason -- the only reason to have entered into any kind of negotiation, especially with the release of so many billions of dollars to the Iranians, was in order to prevent them from going nuclear, the very tenet of that proposal is now in doubt then it becomes a problem next (ph).BREAM: And they're not playing nice. Why are they harassing if this is such a good deal and it helped our relationship and all goodwill in the world, why are they harassing our military personnel?ROGINSKY: Because this deal was never part of changing their behavior globally. This was, again, a very narrow pathway to preventing them from going nuclear. Iran is a rogue regime. It always has been since 1979. While this regime is in place, it always will be. They will continue to harass us probably for the same reasons domestically that some people here oppose any negotiations with Iran. They have their own hard liners and they need to please who think the Americans are the great Satan, as they call us, and they have to harass us in order to placate their domestic politics. Unfortunately that's the regime with which we have to do business with. We can't always do business with nice regimes.BREAM: Marc, do we have to do business -- final word to you -- with these guys?THIESSEN: Well, you know, if we're going to do business, let's do it transparently. I mean, this is part of a pattern.ROGINSKY: agree.THIESSEN: First, a year ago we learned that there was a secret deal to let Iran inspect itself. Then we had a secret plane going with $400 million of ransom money and now we have this secret deal alleged by a former U.N. weapons inspector, who is an independent person who didn't oppose the agreement. This is coming from an independent source saying that they evaded the restrictions in the deal. If this is such a great deal, why is everything so secret? Why can't the Obama administration be transparent with us about what's actually happening?BREAM: All right. Marc and Julie, I felt some agreement from you tonight, and we're going to end on that good note. Thank you, both.ROGINSKY: Have a great night.THIESSEN: Thank you.BREAM: You too. All right, we also have a big story from California tonight where lawmakers there are trying to outlaw undercover sting videos like the ones that left Planned Parenthood in a lot of hot water last year. Dana Loesch is here on why this is a big concern for a lot more than just pro- life folks, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: New developments tonight on a California bill poised to outlaw the type of sting operation that made news last summer about some of Planned Parenthood's practices. If signed by California's governor, this new bill would make it illegal to go undercover and videotape Planned Parenthood or any other health care worker. Furthermore, it makes it illegal to distribute any recordings, meaning anybody with an expose cannot approach the press. Critics are already calling the bill dangerous for whistle- blowers especially with revelations, you'll remember, like this one.(VIDEO PLAYING)BREAM: Joining me now is Dana Loesch, host of ""Dana"" on TheBlaze TV. Great to have you with us tonight.DANA LOESCH, THEBLAZE TV ""DANA"" SHOW HOST: Thanks, Shannon.BREAM: This seems like a pretty brazen attack on the first amendment. There are journalists who have gone undercover and won scores of awards for doing the same thing, but not when it was about abortion. Double standard?LOESCH: Now you're absolutely right. No, it is a double standard. Shannon, you are absolutely right. And the ACLU agrees with us on this. This story is so bizarre that it has made friends of the ACLU and people like me and the ""L.A. Times."" So that's when you know something's up, like the ""L.A. Times"" came out against this. The ACLU did too because this would be one thing. Shannon, this would be one thing if there were not already existing laws that protected patient privacy. But this isn't an issue about patient privacy. This is Planned Parenthood, who has been busted (inaudible) times in the past several years, talking about how to -- discussing with pimps how to evade the system.They didn't report child abuse, and they actually got sued in Colorado because they didn't report child abuse involving a 13-year-old. There was another case in which they were videotaped hiding sexual abuse with two 13- year-olds, one of which they were telling to go ahead and get an abortion. They didn't report that and they refused to follow that mandatory reporting. There are so many instances, not including David Daleiden's medical expose or journalistic expose on what they were doing with these body parts.So they keep telling on themselves. And so that's the entire reason, and it's ridiculous because if Planned Parenthood was a private organization, then they might have a better case of arguing for, oh, we don't want people to record us. But this Shannon, this is an organization that receives half a billion in taxpayer dollars so they need to be held accountable. Or if they don't like to be held accountable, they can just not cash those checks.BREAM: Yeah, $500 million as you know of our taxpayer money that we'd like some transparency there. By the way, a penalty here could include on the first violation, a fine and a jail term of one year or both, and potentially a greater fine if they get caught doing this more than once -- the recordings, I mean multiple years in jail for doing something that other journalists have been celebrated for.LOESCH: Exactly. I mean they spent so much time last year trying to tell everyone that they weren't doing anything shady. Well, this isn't really like the best way to make your case. If they weren't doing anything shady, Shannon, they wouldn't have anything to worry about. This has nothing to do again with patient privacy. When you are an entity that receives as much or any taxpayer dollars, when you are getting subsidized by the government more so than you're receiving private donations, you will be held accountable and you should be.BREAM: Yeah, there have to be -- there have to be answers. All right, Dana, great to see you tonight. Thank you for joining us.LOESCH: Thank you Shannon.BREAM: We will be right back with more ""Kelly File."" Stick around.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: We are keeping a live look on hurricane Hermine as it closes in on the Florida Gulf Coast there in the panhandle. The governor has declared a state of emergency and folks are told to stay away from the coast. We'll keep an eye on it. Thanks for watching. I'm Shannon Bream. This is ""The Kelly File.""

8	8	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/09/01/trump-immigration-speech-breakdown/	Trump immigration speech breakdown	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" September 1, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Boling and Melissa Francis, ""The Five.""He went from soft to hard in four hours. I speak of Donald Trump, giving his first big speech on immigration after that trip to Mexico. Comparing both events it was pure good cop/bad cop. First the good.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans, not only in terms of friendships, but in terms of the tremendous numbers that I've employed in the United States, and they are amazing people, amazing people. I have many friends, so many friends... spectacular, spectacular, hard-working people. I have such great respect for them, and their strong values of family, faith, and community.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Well, that was nice. Oh, wait, here comes the bad cop.(END VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We will build a great wall along the southern border and Mexico will pay for the wall. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Well, that was fast. Mexico didn't even get its one phone call. But maybe this is how negotiations work. You say one thing here and another thing there. It's old school autocrat. Visit a country and you're gracious, back home, you're a strongman on steroids. But behind the scenes you offer the Mexican president a discount on the wall.But last night, Trump actually gave specifics that most countries take for granted and opened with the wall -- that's his stairway to heaven, his big hit. But he also cited the awful visa system and talked about expanding ICE.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur. I call it extreme vetting, right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme... countries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: The shift was clear. Immigration reform means plugging the leak first. He brought up quizzing immigrants on honor killings, women and gay rights.(END VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants, an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people! Applicant will be asked for their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities added towards on radical Islam.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Of course, the left will call this religious persecution. But how come they only defend religion when it hurts our country?Then there's vintage Donald.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Within ICE, I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice, just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK.Maybe they'll be able to deport her.(END VIDEO CLIP)KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Oh, my goodness.GUTFELD: It's a joke. I think.And it was indeed a speech, but also a rally before the converted. Did he win over anyone that he hadn't won already or did he undo the sheer brilliance of his stately Mexican visit? The media says he didn't pivot, which we aren't used to.  Me? I dug the specifics, I asked for them.But after a year of bad blood, have the people who should be listening, are they already moved on or are they just tuning in?Either way, at least we got new hats.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Well, I'll tell you what, I'm going to put this hat on.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Why do they have to be white? Racists.GUILFOYLE: Some are red.GUTFELD: They are beautiful hats. Let's make Mexico great again, also. That's a stroke of brilliance, right, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Yeah, I mean, come on. Why not? But it shows inclusive and that we're working together as a team. I loved the speech yesterday when he was there, when he was with Pena Nieto. I thought that was excellent. This obviously was a rally cry to let them, hey, the Donald Trump candidacy for the presidency of the United Sates is not dead. It's alive and kicking. So, he's there giving the specifics.He's taking up all the air time. Nobody has like heard from Hillary. Maybe we'll get a Christmas card, we're not sure, but it's unbelievable. He's driving the momentum, the energy, the focus. He's the one that showed up to help the families that were suffering terribly, you know, with the floods. He's the one that accepted the invitation to Mexico and he's the one telling you the specifics of people like yourself have asked for. I ask you, Greg, has it caused you to reconsider?GUTFELD: Yeah, I'm always grateful, I'm just wondering if it's too late, but I think its -- I'm glad, and he also mentioned a few things that he hadn't mentioned before. So, I'm always happy to hear those things. Eric, I thought it was also very smart that he pretended that he might go soft, but instead he went hard.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Did he pretend or did we all speculate that he would just play it safe? He had a great morning. He had a great afternoon with Pena Nieto. Everyone said, in fact, I think it went here at the table, he said, you know he should just take those five points and you know, go into the speech and he'll crush it.GUTFELD: I didn't want him to do the speech.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I think what he did -- I think it was a stroke of brilliance. So, he's stately over there. People are different when they're in a foreign country, when you're being diplomatic. You should be different when you're being diplomatic. And when he came home, he went vintage, as you point out, Donald Trump. He hit the 10-point plan that so many people have been asking for. Get specific on everything, and he did. On deportation, on criminal aliens here, on visa programs -- that was big, that visa program.GUTFELD: Yeah, it's always been a problem.BOLLING: So he's going to go aggressively go after people who jump their visas, send them back, send the criminals back. I thought the speech and the policy and the meat of the speech was fantastic. I think he solidified his base vote. I think what he did earlier in the day actually helped him with moderates or let's call them independent or undecided, or at least undecided, at least they can see another side of it. I thought it was fantastic.By the way, if you have any questions, I'm going ahead on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" tonight and I'll ask him.GUILFOYLE: Nice plug. Nice plug.BOLLING: Well, it's more than a plug though because I think there is a question somewhere in there where you said you're going to deport, but define deport. Under Obama's deportation rule, if you stop someone at the border and tell them to go back, that's a deportation. So, if you have 11 million illegal who aren't criminals here and they get to an embassy.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: Or they get to a safe place or an area.GUTFELD: What happens?BOLLING: Can they go there and then apply for citizenship there? And is that they left and they came back in? They beat us. We'll ask him.GUTFELD: Good question. So, what about the -- you keep hearing about his Hispanic advisers. I'm not sure how many, I mean, how will this play with the Hispanics? Did he just write the entire group off?MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: I think he's a genius of what he did yesterday. It's classic inkblot politics that we saw. You know, depending on what you were watching because I do think -- you know, I watched both things live -- and I thought his speech in the middle of the day was very presidential, much softer as you said. And if you watched later, he went back to the screaming crowd and sort of the red meat, which by the way, I mean people were screaming in that crowd. You never hear that from Hillary Clinton, so much...GUTFELD: Well, it's his choir.FRANCIS: It is his choir but when she gets her choir together, they're not hysterical like that. I mean, you guys have so much...GUTFELD: You can look back to President Obama, candidate Obama having that kind of effect.FRANCIS: Yes, also had in (inaudible). OK, so I think he did the inkblot thing. I do think all politicians say one thing in front of one group, one thing in front of another. For example, Hillary Clinton when she's giving a speech to Goldman Sachs or she's standing in front of (inaudible) who gave her and her husband $1 million in various speeches. When she says something I'm sure that's very nice about Wall Street and the banks and how they're the lifeline of the economy and finance is so wonderful. And then she goes out and she bashes evil banks and, you know, we're going to tax the hell out of them and they're either (inaudible) and they're awful when she talks to another crowd and everybody knows it's all about the audience. So, there you go, inkblot politics.GUTFELD: Juan, so when he plays to the audience like that and you hear the cheers, that's all he's getting. Is he getting anybody else? He has to work on a year of antagonism, with the Hispanic vote. Is it too late?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, let's answer your first question which is that what he appeared to do yesterday, which you guys were saluting so aggressively. You say, hey, he went down there, he looked presidential, he took the initiative by beating Hillary Clinton to take the trip to Mexico. This was outreach.This was saying, hey listen, if you had doubts about his temperament, about his ability to deal as an American leader on an international stage, here's Donald Trump. So that's what you guys saluted (ph). Well then, within hours, the story began to shift. Oh, yeah, he did talk about the wall, and yes, President Pena Nieto said no, I'm not paying for a wall, where Donald says he didn't bring it up. Now, it looks like he lied about it.BOLLING: No, no...WILLIAMS: NO, let me finish.BOLLING: Clarify that Juan...WILLIAMS: Hang on -- he certainly did. So let me finish. So then he goes down to Phoenix and he gives a speech and the speech absolutely repels the Latino community. So, you had people who were on his Latino or Hispanic advisory council, who I think in specific here, Jacob Monty, National Hispanic Advisory Council, they were trying to get him to be more reasonable. They were willing to play ball with Donald Trump. Now they're quitting, resigning. They're not necessarily going over to Hillary, but they're gone. So Eric yesterday was saying to me, oh, you know what? They're going to bump up the numbers with the Latino community. Forget about that. Outreach, zero. And where the Clinton campaign...GUTFELD: You guys have to make a bet on that.WILLIAMS: We did. We did already. And then the Clinton campaign, what did the Clinton campaign do? Clinton campaign says, oh, you know what? We're just going to retweet Ann Coulter, we're going to retweet David Duke, because they're the biggest people who loved that speech last night when you're talking about a deportation task force, when you're talking about kicking out people. I mean, most Republicans don't believe that we should be kicking out people. But that's Donald Trump so, no pivot, no change. The guy you knew is the guy you got.BOLLING: I can't use (ph) to clarify that he didn't lie about it. They didn't discuss Mexico paying for the wall.GUILFOYLE: Didn't come up.BOLLING: They discussed the wall. Trump even sat in front of the guy, there's going to be a wall.WILLIAMS: No, no, pay for the wall.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: All right, here's what John Podesta said. Not just...BOLLING: Clinton's Podesta?WILLIAMS: Yes, yes. Not just a case that he choked in the room. He came out of it and lied about it. That's what he did.BOLLING: Well, Pena Nieto clarified a comment that he made right afterwards.WILLIAMS: Yeah. You know what, you guys are really up a tree. You guys are up a tree. Its okay, it's okay.GUTFELD: I mean, I guess my point is I can't see after that speech Hispanics going hey, you know what, now I like him. I just don't see that. So I'm wondering is there enough white people left that he can get so they can write off everybody elseGUILFOYLE: I think he wouldn't be -- I think you guys are in for a surprise here, because you know, I mean, you're talking about my people. I'm telling you that so many of the Hispanics that I talk to and African-Americans are Trump supporters. I think you're underestimating what he's been able to accomplish. And prepare yourself.GUTFELD: I mean the polls don't show that.GUILFOYLE: Well that's not true. There are new polls even out even now and it shows also that...GUTFELD: Among blacks and Hispanics?GUILFOYLE: ...American-born Hispanics, a Rasmussen poll out as well. I'm saying just let it, give it a moment to breathe and see what happens.WILLIAMS: Here's what Gary -- you know what Gary Johnson, who was our guest recently, said oh, how is this going to work? He's going to put this people, this 5,000 more ICE people, this deportation task force, are they going to go door to door into Mexico hunting down Latinos?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: The interesting thing though, when they poll -- when voters are presented a choice, a system that allows illegals a path, they're overwhelmingly for that and they're against deportation.WILLIAMS: Right.GUTFELD: So, how do you deal with that?BOLLING: When you're in a foreign country and you go to the U.S. embassy in a foreign country, you're on U.S. land. You're not on foreign country land anymore. You're in U.S. territory, right? So if you set up -- let's call them deport -- Mexican deportation stations within the United States, and an illegal who is here with a family says, you know, I've been here for five years, I'm paying taxes.I just want to be a United States citizen. They go to this island within the United States. You're technically on Mexican land again, right? You've been deported and you go back to the society. I mean, that's a way, and why is that so bad? That's a very friendly way and nice way to do it.WILLIAMS: I love it when you make these things up. I'm not hearing this from the candidate, but you're talking about like -- not quite, but what most people talk about and that's (inaudible) call touch-back, where they would have to go before they come back. Most people know that's not -- by the way, when you were talking about five years or so, do you know that in fact most of the illegal immigrants have been here more than 10 years and like 20 percent have been here more than 20 years. I mean they are neighbors and co-workersFRANCIS: I think we all agree that this is the diciest part of the issue.GUTFELD: Yeah, and it might not be a winning issue according to that poll. All right, coming up, more reaction to Trump's immigration agenda including from his Democratic opponent and some of his strongest critics who have got some surprising remarks, stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back to ""The Five"" continuing coverage of Donald Trump's immigration speech from last night. After his visit to Mexico, Hillary Clinton responded with this tweet. She said, ""Trump just failed his first foreign policy test -- his first foreign test I guess -- diplomacy isn't as easy as it looks."" but even some Trump's harshest critics are praising him for his day yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Here he is standing on the world stage with a world leader. This is something -- Trump took charge naturally. He walked off the stage as the dominant guy. He pulled it off and I think he really helped himself.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD COLUMNIST: I think this is actually the single best day of the general election campaign for Donald Trump. What you saw today was Trump not only standing with a would-be ally or an ally, a traditional ally, but an ally whose citizens he's basically attacked again and again and again for the better part of the last year, and to pull it off.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, Mr. Juan Williams, so Steve Hayes and Charles Krauthammer, who I just spent a lot of TV time with, who've come around to Trump at least yesterday.WILLIAMS: What? No, I think what they said was they thought Trump had a good showing and Mexico...BOLLING: And you don't? And they said best day.GUILFOYLE: It was the best day of his...WILLIAMS: Look, that was before the speech. That was before a whole controversy about did he lie about getting Pena Nieto to pay for the wall and did they discuss it or not. But I think they're right, I mean, I think that's what you guys were saying to me yesterday. Trump looked like he was on the world stage and carried it off.GUILFOYLE: And found it.WILLIAMS: To my mind, it was a low bar because I mean, what we were fearing -- I think everybody especially Republicans were fearing was somebody is going to throw a shoe at that guy. Somebody is going to curse him out and it's going to be a mess down there, why did he g down there. He took a risk. Well, you know what? You take a risk and he was rewarded. He had a good time in Mexico City. He comes back, though, and he just -- I think he just threw water on his momentary fire.GUTFELD: The one thing -- it's important thing about the risk because he had, you know, he didn't want to do it. And there were a few of his advisers that didn't want to, but he did it anyway. And I think that's important, because if he had not have done that, I think it would have been a real bummer for him. I think it really added a lot. Hillary's tweet, she is kicking herself over this. I mean she saw that he...FRANCIS: Well, where is she?GUILFOYLE: Raising money.GUTFELD: He's setting the agenda now for -- now, she's got to respond to these issues, because he's way ahead.WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, wait, respond to what? He didn't persuade anybody.GUTFELD: But no, by going to Mexico, she's like, people are going, where were you?  BOLLING: How off is that tweet?GUILFOYLE: So off!BLLING: ...policy isn't that easy. He just crushed it.GUILFOLYLE: And somebody had to wake up rip Van Winkle Clinton-stein and say hey, listen to me. What are you thinking? This guy just crushed it. You had an opportunity just like you had an opportunity to go and talk to the people that are suffering that lost their homes and everything that they held near and dear to their hearts.Like, he went there and showed like he has an interest in governing and talking about solutions and getting things done. And what she's doing is interested in getting more Clinton cash, whether it's fund-raising or for the global initiative. They're very good at getting other people's money. But what else can you do?FRANCIS: Well, I mean the money is pretty fantastic and they're the best at raking it in. I've never seen anyone monetize politics the way they did. She was reduced to tweeting, which like you said. Looked like sour grapes but every time we don't see her in the limelight, it's because she's off at another fabulous fund-raiser raking in like $140 million last month, something like that.Trump raked in $5 million yesterday and Wednesday alone. Based on this, if you look at the donors, people liked what they saw during the day. But she's using all of that money to hammer him and I wonder what is the dominant strategy? He's looking better in the polls, but she's really got all that cash to spend in big states.BOLLING: Once around the table, what is she doing? She's sitting back, she's not aggressive. She's not out there. She had some, I don't know, ranting speech yesterday. She didn't look and she didn't sound good. Is she just trying to ride the clock out?GUTFELD: I think she looks -- for example, she doesn't do press conferences. To her, that's like a colonoscopy. It's like an invasive procedure and you don't do it unless you necessarily have to.GUILFOYLE: Unless she's like (inaudible).GUTFELD: Well, that's...GUILFOYLE: Just wrong (ph).BOLLING: Interesting. She's continued to lay back like this.FRANCIS: I think that this is a definite strategy. If you look at the way that every other race has gone for her, she's way out ahead. And then the more people see her up close, the more speeches she makes, the more hand she shakes, the more babies she kissed, the closer it gets and the more she falls behind. I think this is a concerted effort to keep her out of the press and out of the limelight that she stands up, she does a speech. They take little snippets. Nobody takes it full because it's really boring and people click away from it. So, I think that they keep her under wraps for as long as they possibly can. And maybe that's smarter.BOLLING: How can that be smart? You want to do one. Why do we play preseason football games and baseball? We play preseason so you could practice for the real deal, right? She's not even practicing.GUILFOYLE: It's pretty shocking.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: There are two things to say -- please. But there are two things to say here. One is that people click and people turn on to Donald Trump, Melissa, to your point, because they think this guy is out of control. It's right. You don't know what he's going to say. It's so entertaining and so fascinating. You can't turn him off, right? Okay, but the result is not that people come away thinking boy, that's someone I trust to be my president in charge of my country's military. No. Yesterday, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, you know, these are people with conservative values you'd think with possible ground.BOLLING: The Chamber of Commerce is conservative?WILLIAMS: Yes, it is, this is the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. In any case, less conservative than our normal Chamber of Commerce, but yes. And Javier Palermo says, he calls the guy a payaso, a clown. A complete clown is what he judged the performance he has today at the base (ph). I'm just telling you...BOLLING: I wouldn't put them in the conservative camp.WILLIAM: OK, I'm just telling. Tim Kaine said this was amateur hour. That's what he said this morning on NBC.FRANCIS: What else is he going to say?(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: Isn't that what you would expect from Tim Kaine?WILLIAMS: No. I would expect -- Tim Kaine is a pretty honest guy.GUILFOYLE: Oh, come on!WILLIAMS: Liste, I'm telling you...GUILFOYLE: He's trying to get in the White House.WILLIAMS: The Clinton people yesterday, after what happened in Mexico City, people like Howard Wilson said, ""If this is what we were looking for, a pivot from Donald Trump, he just had a winning moment, a great time."" But it was after the lie is revealed, after the speech, which he just throws everything out the window.FRANCIS: We weren't saying that after the early time. When we were out there after -- in Mexico, you said it was all about that president being nice to him.WILLIAMS: It was. The president was very courteous, hospitable. As I said, it was a low bar. Nobody threw a shoe at him. Nobody cursed him out...GUILFOYLE: Oh, my god. Juan, you know better than that! You know better than that.BOLLING: Next, new trouble for Hillary over emails. Evidence reveals Clinton sent top secret email material from her private server after she left the State Department. Details when we return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: How ironic is this? Yesterday, Hillary Clinton was preaching about cyber security.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You've seen reports Russia's hacked into a lot of things, China has hacked into a lot of things. Russia even hacked into the Democratic National Committee. Maybe even some state election systems. So, we've got to step up our game. As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber-attacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Let's start with your server, shall we? Well, at the same time, we're learning she continued to send classified material over email using her unsecured server after leaving the State Department. It's true Juan. What is the excuse for this?WILLIAMS: I don't think there's any excuse. I mean, I don't buy into the use if the server anyway. I never understood it but I guess, I mean, one argument among people who are reporters is she's trying to avoid the Freedom of Information Act. Another argument would be that she simply wanted her own way of communicating with her people and was going to hide it. I don't know, but I just think it was a mistake and I think she's acknowledged it was a mistake. But I appreciate your point, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Which is?WILLIAMS: Which is there she is talking about the cyber threat.GUILFOYLE: Which is the irony of it all, the hypocrisy.WILLIAMS: The other part of -- this is an inside baseball thing among the Democrats -- is that you have people right now, including in the Clinton campaign, who are critical of President Obama for not going after the Russians more aggressively for what they see as having hacked the DNC and the potential for embarrassment come October, you know, if the Russians want to embarrass Hillary Clinton.GUILFOYLE: And are those people also disappointed and upset with Hillary Clinton's reckless judgment regarding our national security, Juan?WILLIAMS: No. I think overwhelmingly Democrats -- I mean, I just tell you what the polls very clearly show. Democrats don't care about this issue.  But it is damaging with independents. I think it's damaging to the point of damnation with Republicans who see her as, you know, as FBI director Comey said, having been reckless.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: But a lot of this has to do with the fact that, you know, people who don't like her and have questions about her largely focus on trustworthiness, honesty, see her as -- and her husband as always pushing a little too far. And this brings us back to...GUILFOYLE: The donation envelope.WILLIAMS: Yes. This brings us back to our conversation about the foundation.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: I think you see Democrats now saying, ""Hey, it was a bad idea, close it down. You've got to get out of this, Hillary.""GUILFOYLE:  All right. Well, instead, they'll just going to put another Clinton in charge. Bolling.BOLLING: I'm still trying to figure out why 33,000 emails were OK to delete, not only delete but delete them to the point where even, according to the Bleach bit or Trey Gowdy, even God couldn't bring them back if he wanted to.I mean, isn't -- that's evidence, right? If you're going to say, ""Look, I'll turn over 30,000,"" which she did, and then they found 15,000 more. At least hold the 33,000 that you don't want to turn over in a place where you can keep them and you need to turn -- put them on a zip file.WILLIAMS: Look, I don't know. I mean, my sense of this is...GUILFOYLE: Unless you want to avoid justice.BOLLING: You're hiding something.GUILFOYLE: It's moral consciousness of guilt. That's a jury instruction.WILLIAMS: Wow. That's pretty harsh. I mean, I think...GUILFOYLE: That's the law.WILLIAMS: Let's just go with what the lady said, which is that it was her private and personal email. I don't know.BOLLING: So trust her on this? Even though you (CROSSTALK).WILLIAMS: As Jim Comey, as the FBI, as the State Department, as everybody has said, she was within her right to do it. I just -- I agree with you.  If I'm conspiracy minded, I'm saying, ""Hey, how come these things were gone for all time""? I know if you or I...BOLLING: If we were running for president...WILLIAMS: ... these people would recover all our email in an instant, let me tell you that.FRANCIS: I think it's rich to have her up there, talking on the national stage talking about how we need to be -- she's going to be really tough on cyber security.In one hand, she's acting like she knows something about computer computers and technology and securing our state. On the other hand, she thinks you wipe a server with a cloth. She doesn't know anything about emails. Her emails are so boring.I mean, she can't have it both ways. She's either an idiot or she's fit to be in charge of our national security when it comes to cyber threats. And she's already said, ""I didn't know anything. I didn't know any better. I didn't have the intent."" So the opposite of the intent is she's just an idiot about technology, and...GUILFOYLE: Well, I wouldn't say ""idiot.""FRANCIS: ... now she's -- well, she says she doesn't know. You know, she didn't know she was supposed to save all those things. She didn't know.  And when it's clear the reason why she wanted to have all those things on her private server is because there was a trail of people like Doug Band saying, ""Hey, listen, this guy is trying to get in the State Department through the front door. He can't get in the front, and he can't get in.  He's a special friend."" I mean, they always use the same phrase, which meant they had given millions of dollars. And then that person was ushered right in to the access they wanted.It's supposed to be the party of the little people. But instead they're the party of the big donors. Here's your access; pay for it. And even Donna Brazile says, that's just the way it works. So that's it. That's how the Democrats work.WILLIAMS: Wait, that's how politics work.FRANCIS: It was Democrats standing up saying that's how it works.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: I believe it's how.FRANCIS: That's not OK.GUILFOYLE: They're the ones that are under investigation. That's the problem.  FRANCIS: That's why Donald Trump wants to throw out all the regular politicians. Let's bring in some outsiders. If all politicians from Washington take payment for access, then they should all get out, and let's put some people in who aren't running on that scale. And that's exactly why Donald Trump has been so popular, because he said, ""This doesn't make any sense.""GUILFOYLE: And Gregory, you shall have the floor.GUTFELD: Well, Clintons are always leaving things on private servers.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: The -- Hillary's warning about cyber threats is like Anthony Weiner warning against sexting. She has relinquished all authority on the topic.But I would even go beyond her and talk about every candidate that we have come across. In the arena of cyber terror and cyber terror and the rise of artificial intelligence, we're dealing with a generational problem.  There's a lot of people that were born a while ago who don't see these as vital issues, because they didn't grow up with this stuff.And whoever becomes president is going to have to start looking around and finding the right people from Silicon Valley, people like Elon Musk or Nick Bostrom or anybody who understands these topics. Because I don't think Trump knows it either. You can think he does. He's going to throw the bums out, but he doesn't know which bums to put in.Hillary doesn't know jack about this. I don't know about Gary Johnson. He might. But I don't know. I just think that we're in trouble in this arena, no matter what. Until they start putting, you know, fresh blood in.FRANCIS: OK.GUILFOYLE: OK. Perfect.GUTFELD: Is it really perfect?GUILFOYLE: I thought it was pretty good.GUTFELD: All right.GUILFOYLE; I'm happy with it.Directly ahead, trouble for Hillary. A brand-new FOX News poll shows Clinton's lead over Trump is shrinking. We're going to break all of it down, the numbers, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Brand-new FOX News polls show Donald Trump closing in on Hillary Clinton. In the latest head-to-head matchup, Clinton now leads Trump by just six points. She had a ten-point advantage early last month.But a sobering reality in this election. A large, 44 percent minority says both rivals are, quote, ""terrible candidates.""FRANCIS: I love that part.WILLIAMS: Terrible candidates.FRANCIS: I love that part.WILLIAMS: So OK, you love that. Tell me. You know, like, a curse on both their houses, Melissa?FRANCIS: Like, I -- these are the worst candidates I've ever seen in my life. I hate both these people. I'm leaving the country. Forty-four percent of people asked felt like that.The other question that I absolutely adored in this was the likelihood that the Clintons were selling influence to those who donated to the foundation, because obviously, I'm obsessed with the foundation. They've amassed so much money; it's such a great slush fund. Sixty-six percent of people said it was very likely or somewhat likely that they were selling influence.You know what? I decided that I'm going to stop fighting against the foundation. When they win, I'm just going to give all my money to the foundation and buy influence and just get it. You want to go in with me?GUILFOYLE: Well, have Greg do that. I wouldn't put it in your name.FRANCIS: Stop fighting it. I'm just going to join it.BOLLING: You don't need $1 billion if you have a $1 billion or $2 billion foundation with your name on it.FRANCIS: Yes.BOLLING: And you're flying around the country...FRANCIS: Sweet.BOLLING: ... writing everything off. It's -- all the expenses are going to them.FRANCIS: I'm joining.BOLLING: And you have the same influence as if you were a billionaire, although there may be some ties that they're doing things. If any of that money, even a dime of that money ends up in their campaign coffers somewhere...WILLIAMS: Here's the thing. I think we have a FOX poll here on honesty and trustworthiness, Eric. Oh, maybe we don't.FRANCIS: I can read it to you.WILLIAMS: OK. So here it is. This is the heart and soul of it. Honest and trustworthy, Clinton 31, Trump 35. At this point, actually Trump is -- looks like he's doing better -- oh, no, there are 66 percent say she's not honest and trustworthy; 63 percent say Trump's not.FRANCIS: He's doing better, but that's all awful.WILLIAMS: That's what I was trying to say.FRANCIS: It's all awful.WILLIAMS: I think that illustrates the point.BOLLING: You can clearly see he's doing better in the yes column. He was up by four in the yes column. There it is.WILLIAMS: But Melissa's point is...FRANCIS: They're all horrible people.WILLIAMS: ... these aren't -- these aren't people you'd leave the kids with.FRANCIS: Yes, yes. They're basically -- it's like, you know, whatever it is, so we have whatever it is, 320 million people in this country. It's down to two. So these people are horrible people who would do anything to win is basically what everybody who answered this survey said.WILLIAMS: You know, and Trump is still struggling, K.G., with Republicans.  According the FOX poll, only 74 percent of self-identified Republicans back him. Eighty-one percent of self-identified Democrats back Clinton. But the issue in the FOX poll, and I think this is the opportunity for Trump, as he tries to bump up in the polls, is can he get more Republicans to support him?GUILFOYLE: OK. Well, I think doing speeches like he did, you know, last night and going to Mexico like he did and going to flood-ravaged areas like he did, I think all of that are steps in the right direction. I think he is making a concerted effort to broaden his base and bring in independents and increase his numbers with women and with minorities, as well.So I think he's doing the hard work, and now you've got to give it a chance to breathe.WILLIAMS: All right. So Eric, let's go back to the FOX poll. One of the things they did was they broke down the issues. So they said, terrorism and economy, who do you trust more? It turns out, this is a surprise since, you know, Trump is getting closer. Now they back Clinton.BOLLING: In terrorism. In terrorism, not the economy.WILLIAMS: Yes, economy and it's at 48 -- oh, 48 each. You're right. What do you think?BOLLING: Well, you're asking me about polls.WILLIAMS: Sorry, all right.BOLLING: Here's what I know. The crowds you see that come out for Trump are extremely energized.GUILFOYLE: Greg's drawing a robot.BOLLING: Happens for a long time. Those are the people who will come out.  They'll wait in line. And I'm not sure that the people who are coming out to see Hillary Clinton are the ones -- I mean, they...WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: I just think there's a vast difference in the enthusiasm level on the Republican side versus the Democrat side.WILLIAMS: As you know, Greg is someone who will say to hell with all of them. So Greg, let me just point this out. The FOX poll says...GUILFOYLE: Hey, Greg.WILLIAMS: ... that basically, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are not only dishonest and not worthy of your trust, but they'll do anything to get elected.GUTFELD: Thank God we feel that way. That's how Americans are supposed to think. That's why -- America was created based on the hatred, distrust of authority. You're not supposed to trust politicians. That's on you if you trust them. It's healthy to despise them. And I think you should always look at every politician -- never become -- never fall for a cult of personality, right? It doesn't matter how much you like somebody. They're going to let you down.WILLIAMS: But you never trusted...BOLLING: Obama. It was a cult of personality.GUILFOYLE: I know. He's saying don't fall for it.GUTFELD: Exactly. That's my point.WILLIAMS: You never trusted a politician?BOLLING: Trump has a cult of personality, as well, yes.FRANCIS: No. What politician did you trust?WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh. Are you kidding? I'm old here, Melissa, but I mean, John F. Kennedy was well-loved in this country. Ronald Reagan was loved in this country by a lot of people.GUTFELD: But JFK was well-loved after, right?WILLIAMS: What do you mean, after?GUTFELD: After he was assassinated.WILLIAMS: Well, that added to it.GUTFELD: He had a lot -- he had a lot of issues prior to that. I mean, he was dealing with some other stuff, and I think history changes the way your view.WILLIAMS: Yes, but you don't see numbers. These numbers, Gregory, this is...GUTFELD: I agree with you.WILLIAMS: This is Frank Underwood territory.FRANCIS: They'd like him better.WILLIAMS: Up next, all eyes on Colin Kaepernick ahead of tonight's final preseason game. The 49ers face the San Diego Chargers as they host -- get this -- salute to the military night.GUILFOYLE: Wow.WILLIAMS: Will the quarterback protest ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" again?  Holy smokes. Details ahead.GUTFELD: Is that tonight?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FRANCIS: Talk about awkward. Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the national anthem could grow even more intense night. For the first time since the controversy exploded, the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback is expected to be on the field for the annual salute to the military before his team's preseason game against the San Diego Chargers.According to reports, the defiant NFL star says he plans to sit out during the anthem again, just like he did last week against the Packers.All right. He's painted himself into quite a corner here. Anyone have an idea of how he could gracefully get out of this? Because now everybody is looking at him. He's said he's going to sit down. It's a really embarrassing night. It's a salute to the military. Everybody is going to stand for ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Even if he wants to stand and have this whole thing be over and all this attention, there's no graceful way out.GUTFELD: He should say, ""Out of -- out of concern for my teammates, I don't want my teammates to be a target of crowd antipathy, so I'm going to stand, because I don't want them to be adversely affected by my behavior.""Again, his act -- his act against a state of oppression is permitted.  Therefore, the act is proven wrong. He is more than allowed to do this, so it's actually -- when he does it, he's proving his own point to be incorrect.FRANCIS: It reminds me of my kids when they paint themselves into some kind of corner and you want to offer them some sort of out. K.G., what could he do? What could he do?GUILFOYLE: Stand up. Stand up.FRANCIS: But then he looks like he's folding on his principle and everything he did along the way.GUILFOYLE: Believe it or not, it's true. He can say, ""Listen, I don't want to be a distraction away from the game or my teammates or adversely impact them. I'm here to play football. I'm grateful to play football for an organization like the Niners,"" who by the way, offered to trade him and nobody wanted him. I don't think ESPN wants him, and they could use some help, too.So I don't know what to tell you. I'm very disappointed in this. I mean, you know, the 49ers was an organization that was revered. They were one of the, like, titans and football dynasties that people have enjoyed for years, and now, I think it's like, my God, even the Raiders look better than us.GUTFELD: Don't ever say that! I love the Oakland Raiders, but they're moving to Vegas.GUILFOYLE: Yes. We're the bad boys of football.WILLIAMS: I mean, I think all of you are viewing it in terms of the military. So the way he could handle it is to go and, you know, make it clear that he admires our military and the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our great country. But he has to, I think, stand by his principle, which is that, you know, the NFL, nobody -- you have a right to protest, as Greg said. So if he wants to protest, that's his protest.  I don't agree with it, but if that's what he wants to do.FRANCIS: By the way, has anyone noticed the socks that he's been wearing?  They were making the rounds on the Internet. I think we have a picture.  Look at that, Eric Bolling.BOLLING: Yes. They're law enforcement depicted as, I believe it's pigs.  Is that right? Yes, pigs.So look, I'm against boycotts. I hate boycotts. I just don't believe in them. But you can, as coach, head coach, you can sit him. That's one way of -- you know, it's not a boycott. You teach him a little bit of a lesson.WILLIAMS: Well, that's not fair.BOLLING: To sit him?WILLIAMS: On the basis of his politics?GUILFOYLE: No, he's making a problem for the team.BOLLING: Here's why -- here's why you might sit him. Because if Trent Brown, Andrew Tiller, Joe Staley or Zane Beadles, who are his offensive line, have anyone in law enforcement as a brother or a father...GUILFOYLE: Yes, take a knee.BOLLING: Let a defensive back just happen to get by on a back side on a quarterback.WILLIAMS: OK. So you think everybody is not to be trusted?GUILFOYLE: No. He's talking about the offensive. The offensive line doesn't protect the quarterback, like whoops, and then you trip on your shoelace.BOLLING: Ole, I think they call it, ole.WILLIAMS: I don't know. I don't know.FRANCIS: Not sure we solved the problem, but anyway, ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Time for ""One More Thing"" -- Eric.BOLLING: OK, a couple things. First, Dallas police chief David Brown announced his retirement. He will retire on October 22. This is the guy who so famously did so well with that big shooting in Dallas. You remember where five cops were killed.Something you didn't know about Chief David Brown, you may not know, is his son was shot in 2010 and killed in a shootout with law enforcement.GUTFELD: Wow.BOLLING: But that guy is hailed as a hero. So congratulations on a wonderful career as sheriff -- I'm sorry, Police Chief David Brown.OK, now this. This video is either -- either the running of the bulls on October 28th or all the entire MSNBC audience running over to see ""The O'Reilly Factor"" when I host.GUILFOYLE: We're doing that again.BOLLING: Donald Trump, who will call in. We'll have a discussion about some of the things we talked about today, clarify a couple of the questions that we all had at the table and you probably have, as well.GUILFOYLE: All right.GUTFELD: K.G.GUILFOYLE: Cool, fantastic.Well, I want to, especially in light of this whole deal with Colin Kaepernick and his lack of respect, I want to take the time out today to commend a group of patriots at Michigan middle school. So students at Big Rapids Middle School gathered around the flagpole on Monday, the first day of the new school year. A trumpeter played ""Reveille"" as they raised the American flag. Then the huge crowd of students and teachers began citing the pledge of allegiance. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Such a great way to show respect for our nation, for our country, for those who have fought and served so valiantly and given up their life so that we can have the freedom to express our opinion here. So well done.GUTFELD: Time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: ""Greg's Secret to Happiness.""(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: You know in the summertime maybe you can't afford a swimming pool? I know that I can't in New York City. You know what's equally as refreshing?GUILFOYLE: No.GUTFELD: Just a pool full of balls.GUILFOYLE: Ewww.GUTFELD: Dogs love to jump in -- look at this. Ah, how refreshing is that? Everywhere they go, they see a big thing of balls, they just jump right in. You can't resist it. It's just like water. It's just like water, without getting wet. You don't need towels. Just fill up a whole crate of balls.GUILFOYLE: I think you should get it.GUTFELD: Yes, I do this when I have free time.  All right. Who's next? Juan.WILLIAMS: Didn't we have a thing with a dog and tennis balls recently?GUTFELD: Yes. Yes, that was yesterday.WILLIAMS: Oh, sorry. OK. D.C.'s housing market going through the roof, and it's obviously the one property you can't buy: the White House. But what if you could buy it? Like, you know, what if Greg wanted it?So we went to somebody and they said, ""You know what? For 18 acres, 750 artifacts, 132 rooms, you can have it for $250 million."" To which I thought, gee, that's low. Well, the consultant who came up with the number said that's because there are too many restrictions and regulations on the 18 acres to really give it value.GUTFELD: All right. Quickly.FRANCIS: You know what's better than the White House? Bears on the loose.  Take a look at this, earlier today in Pasadena, California. They love pools, too, but real water instead of the kind filled with balls.A couple of bears on the loose making their way into people's backyards.  They were dipping in somebody's pool. Eventually they hopped in a Dumpster. What a jackpot. They're like, ""This is awesome.""GUTFELD: It's a bear's paradise.FRANCIS: ""Why did we not think of this sooner? Look at this great grub.""  And then one little dog comes and chases them away. How could those giant bears be afraid of that little dog?GUTFELD: That's actually Alec Baldwin, by the way.FRANCIS: That makes sense.GUTFELD: Being chased by Jeremy Piven.FRANCIS: That makes sense.GUTFELD: Never miss an episode of ""The Five.""
