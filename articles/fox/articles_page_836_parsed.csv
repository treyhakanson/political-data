IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.ESPN HOST UNDER FIRE FOR COMPARING TEA PARTY, FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS TO ISISMichelle Fields:  It seems like there is a bit of a double standard.  We're talking about a conservative group that's trying to save American taxpayers and he's calling them ISIS, a group of people who behead and rape innocent people and it seems as though there's not even a slap on the wrist.  This isn't the first time he's been in trouble.  He was suspended for making extremely sexist comments about a colleague, and it seems like ESPN doesn't care.  Wayne Rogers:  The fact of the matter is, guys like that who are going to express themselves, it doesn't really matter.  Why would anybody listen to a sportscaster talking about politics? Jessica Tarlov:  He was obviously going too far there, but he's not a political commentator, he was just making a point.  He's making actually, a valid point.  He's talking about how obstructionist the tea party movement is.  There's a reason that they have their lowest approval rating in history. Jonathan Hoenig:  What is called obstructionist is actually just ideological.  The Tea Party stands for something, of course, so does ISIS, but that's totally corrupt and ridiculous but the Tea Party stands for something.  They stand for lower taxes.  They stand for economic freedom.  They stand for a free America and that's seen as corrupt in today's society.  You're supposed to be a middle of the roader.  You're supposed to be a compromiser.  That's what people really hate about the Tea Party.  Not about their ideas, but the way they go out doing them, actually standing for them seems terrible in today's world. MSNBC HOST'S COMMENT ON ""HARD WORKER"" AND SLAVERY SPARKS DEBATEJonathan Hoenig:  Melissa Harris Perry has officially jumped the shark on race baiting.  She's living in an alternate universe.Jessica Tarlov:  I'm really not with her on this.  I don't understand the comparison.  I understand her keeping a picture on her wall.  We need to always remember what happened during the time that we had slavery, and we need to understand the black experience in this country, which is something that we actively talk about with the Black Lives Matter movement, but this point just makes her look really silly and out of touch.Michelle Fields:  It's a bit hypocritical.  The person that was on her program that said hard worker was Republican and she was obviously outraged and stopped him.  If you watch her show, she says hard worker many times on her program.  She had on a clip of Hillary Clinton talking about hard workers, and she had no problem with it.  She's fine saying that, she's fine with Hillary Clinton; she's not okay with Republicans saying that.  I think there's just selective outrage. Wayne Rogers:  The idea that somebody is working harder than somebody else, is a judgement call.  They have no idea.  This is a term that they have ginned up so that it conveys a racial image.  They want to convey a racial image and it's just stupid.SOUTH CAROLINA OFFICER FIRED FOR BODY-SLAMMING STUDENT WHO REFUSED TO LEAVE CLASSJessica Tarlov:  I think it's awful that we're scapegoating this back on to the child.  Yes, she could have complied, but that doesn't mean in any way that we can justify what the cop was doing here.  If it goes beyond excessive force, he was showing no respect for her.  What values is that sending out to the community, saying that law enforcement can just pick up a kid, and throw them?   We've also spent way more time investigating the officer's past.  People are talking about that he won an excellence award last year, that he was cleared of civil rights charges, no one is talking about what's going on with that little girl.  She actually is in foster care.  No one is talking about that, what her experience is.  That officer should have cleared the room, and talked to her one on one.  I don't care about disrupting the actual class, they were already disrupted.Wayne Rogers:  That cop, whether he was right or wrong or the little girl did something right or wrong.  The fact of the matter is that she had no respect for him.  She didn't stop what she was doing, she didn't protest, she didn't do any of those things.  That's a climate that we have in the United States today of challenging all authority.  That the authorities may be right, but who cares?Jonathan Hoenig:  Jessica says, the cops should have cleared the room and talked to the student, a cop is force.  That's the police, that's what the law is.  So if you don't obey the police, you should expect that force will be used against you.  There's a tremendous breakdown in our society.  I think a lot of it started with the rise of the modern progressive movement in the 1960s.  All these things like food stamps, welfare, mandatory drug laws, affirmative action, of course the terrible public schools, that is what contributes to the home environment, that Jessica was alluding to.Michelle Fields:  If I was in this position, and my mom saw this video, she would obviously be upset by what the police officer did, but she would also ask me why did it ever get to this point?  No one seems to be talking about that.  These videos keep coming out on the Internet like this and no one wants to have a discussion about what transpired before any of this happened.  It seems as though there is no respect for authority.ENERGY DEPARTMENT: HALLOWEEN PUMPKINS ARE HELPING CAUSE GLOBAL WARMINGMichelle Fields:  I'm actually really shocked that the Democrats and the government are waging a war on Halloween because this should be their ideal day right?  You go around, and you demand treats that you didn't earn.  This is basically Jess's and Juan Williams' utopia. Jessica Tarlov:  It's not about being a liberal or conservative.  It's about being responsible about our planet.  We know that methane gas which is what comes out of the 254 million tons of waste that pumpkins contribute to has 20 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide.  We also know that greenhouse gases add to climate change, scientists have confirmed this.Jonathan Hoenig:  Did you ever notice how the Green movement can ruin anything that human beings enjoy?  They guilt you into using any element of the earth.  Halloween is supposed to be fun, it's supposed to be social.  Only the Greens could make it into something that you should feel guilty about as a human being. "	['Perry', 'Black', 'Harris', 'Clinton']	[]

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" June 3, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle, along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Melissa Francis and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""An angry mob of anti-Trump protesters square off with supporters in an ugly and chaotic scene outside his rally in San Jose, yesterday. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(beep) (beep) (beep) (beep) (beep) (shouting) (beep).(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Out of control protesters burning an American flag and battering Trump supporters, throwing punches and eggs, leaving them bloody. In the wake of the violence, an editor at VOX praised the unruly demonstrators with this tweet, ""Advice; if Trump comes to your town, start a riot."" Moments ago, Trump slammed the unruly protesters for attacking his supporters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: And they walk out and they get accosted by a bunch of thugs burning the American flag, burning .CROWD: Boo.TRUMP: . the American flag. And you know what they are? They are thugs.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. That was obviously an upsetting scene. Everybody seen that's been replayed over and over again, violence, and a woman surrounded, you know, being pummeled with eggs. It was just very upsetting, because you think someone would jump in to try to help this woman, Melissa.MELISSA FRANCIS, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, and then somebody goes out there with the intent to squander protein like that. I mean they showed up with the eggs, ready to pummel people with them. And there are a lot more serious things. I mean you look at what went on in Albuquerque, and when they came with bottles of urine, and they're trashing property and breaking windows. I mean, what has this country come to? I can't believe we're doing this at the same time Trump gets blamed for a lot of these things. You know, these are, if you -- by virtue of you coming to town, you're sort of drawing out these crowds. That's not fair.GUILFOYLE: All right. So Eric, the narrative is this is the presidency of Donald Trump, what America will look like, because these people came out to protest and they're flying, you know the Mexican flag, burning the American flag. I mean, it just complete chaos.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Do these fools think they're hurting Donald Trump by doing this?GUILFOYLE: Yeah. I don't know.BOLLING: They're for --GUILFOYLE: They're not.BOLLING: Waving the Mexican flag, cold-cocking people. Another guy hit with a bag filled with rocks from the side because he held with a Trump poster. This is America, you're allowed to be for people and against people, but you're not allowed to violently be for and against people. It's more like anarchists. I'm pretty sure these aren't Hillary supporters or Bernie supporters. This feels like a third party coming in here. It's like maybe the wild liberal left that says let's stop Trump at any cost and pull these shenanigans. Yes, the mayor of San Jose where all this took place was outraged, not at the rioters, not at the protesters, outraged at Donald Trump for being the cause of the riots and the protesters, and that's asinine. That mayor is a democrat.GUILFOYLE: OK. Well, he might be out of a job pretty soon too, depending on how people react to his nonsense. All right, Greg.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well, you know, I was, I was at the gym as I usually am, at the gym in the morning, and I'm watching the headlines. Every single headline is protesters assault Trump's supporters. This is the problem, where it begins is that they're called protesters. They are actually not protesters at all. They are violent thugs and they shouldn't be allowed to be protected by the moniker of protester. If that's a protest, then arson is a campfire because they're there with one idea only, and that is to violently hurt people. This is the -- if you took this behavior out of this context and you put it in a shopping center or a movie theater, people would react in horror to see this kind of thing happening. But somehow, when you put it in this, this false narrative of a protest, it's suddenly acceptable. And, but the thing is it's not going to go well for these, these aggressors, because sooner or later these peaceful people, they're going to respond and they're going to come prepared to respond. And these and these young out of shape aggressors are not going to know what's going to hit them, and it's called self-defense, and it's not going to be pretty.BOLLING: Can I throw something on that also?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Not punch or punch.BOLLING: There's another way they can respond these peaceful anti- protesters, protesters, what you even just called -- no vote.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: No vote for Trump because they hate that so much.GUTFELD: Yeah.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well they're already going to vote for Trump. I mean I think it helps Trump with people who are Trump's supporters, because they see now that they feel victimized by this kind of behavior. But I think American rights, American democracy, American politics is victimized when you have people behaving in a violent manner. But what I really disagree with all of you about is the idea that Trump bears no responsibility. This is a guy who it seems to me has antagonized Mexican-Americans. What are we talking about? We're talking about here, with in San Jose. We're talking about Burlingame, a month ago when he had to jump the fence off the highway. We're talking about Albuquerque in New Mexico.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Wait, wait --WILLIAMS: We're talking --GUTFELD: Can I just --WILLIAMS: No. Let me finish up. I mean, I think this is the guy who says, Mexico is sending its worst people.GUTFELD: But Juan --WILLIAMS: And they're rapists, and they're criminals, and we need to build a wall.GUTFELD: Juan --WILLIAMS: And we need to keep out the Muslims. He is -- nobody is advocating violence.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Nobody --BOLLING: Including him.GUTFELD: But Juan, waitWILLIAMS: Nobody --GUTFELD: Can I just --GUILFOYLE: Including Donald Trump.WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, no. You're wrong on that.BOLLING: Including him.WILLIAMS: Not at all. You know what he does?BOLLING: How can you say he's advocating violence when he just -- but he say, keep the bad people out.WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: And then here you have --WILLIAMS: Keep the --BOLLING: The bad people who are --WILLIAMS: What bad people?BOLLING: For burning the American flag.WILLIAMS: Now wait a second.BOLLING: And punching people in the face.WILLIAMS: Let me just say, people who feel that they are being defamed by Donald Trump, called rapists and criminals are going to have a reaction, Eric. And remember, he's the only candidate who has advocated violence. He's the only one who has, when a guy got sucker-punched, that I'll pay the man's legal fee for sucker-punching. He is the only one who said, maybe, some of these protesters should be roughed up. He's the only one who said, in the good old days, some of these protesters would be taken out of here on a stretcher(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: So Juan, when a woman goes out at night without a bra on .GUILFOYLE: Oh, boy.GUTFELD: Is that -- does she deserve it, if she's attacked?WILLIAMS: No, I --GUTFELD: Because essentially, this woman got egged because she was wearing a Trump shirt. She was wearing a Trump shirt and there was a NBC sports reporter who said, well, you know, she might have egged it on.WILLIAMS: That's ridiculous. And the CNN --GUTFELD: But it's the same logic, Juan.WILLIAMS: But no, CNN said --GUTFELD: Language is different than deed. Language and dress is different than deed.WILLIAMS: Absolutely.GUTFELD: If you basically did something.WILLIAMS: No. Taunting is also different than deed. So some people said she was taunting them. I don't care.GUTFELD: He's pointing at her shirt.WILLIAMS: The violence is wrong, and Podesta, John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary's campaign said, no place in American politics. So no candidates said Trump is the one that says violence is OK.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, but you try to just --BOLLING: But you just agreed .GUILFOYLE: No. You try to justify it.BOLLING: . that mayor of San Jose who said it is Trump fault for all these violence.WILLIAMS: I just --BOLLING: All of these acts of violence that are occurring in his --WILLIAMS: I did not say that. I said that Trump --GUILFOYLE: Yes, you did.WILLIAMS: Trump says things that antagonize and demean --BOLLING: He said too.WILLIAMS: And defame .BOLLING: And that makes --WILLIAMS: Mexican -American.GUILFOYLE: And what is the --BOLLING: And that makes violence OK?GUILFOYLE: And what is the suggestion to that?WILLIAMS: No, I'm telling you that that's the kind --GUILFOYLE: No, but Juan, you're saying that as the justification .WILLIAMS: No, I'm not.GUILFOYLE: . for their lawless conduct.WILLIAMS: I am making it --GUILFOYLE: And physical assault. You are.WILLIAMS: No. You ain't --GUILFOYLE: You're saying Trump is the one who says this, look what happens in the aftermath of language. And you're not really accepting any personal responsibility on behalf of the people that are doing these actions that aren't all Mexican-Americans irritated by comments that they heard had in the press. Look at the crowd. I mean, look and see who's there. There's a variety of people there, they're burning the American flags, they're beating up this woman, she can't -- doesn't even have safe passage to get out. I mean, really?FRANCIS: Yet not --GUILFOYLE: And it's Donald Trump's fault?FRANCIS: You're legitimizing --GUILFOYLE: It's like a long shot.FRANCIS: . protesters, which I think was the best way made so far. What Greg said is that these are not people who are out legitimately protesting that they think their rights are being disenfranchised? I mean, this is an organized group that's going out to start trouble.WILLIAMS: Wait, are you saying -- you say --FRANCIS: I don't think this has anything to do with Donald.WILLIAMS: Remember, Trump said, Trump said he thought --FRANCIS: I don't think this has anything to do with Donald Trump.WILLIAMS: He thought a long time ago in Chicago .FRANCIS: This isn't like the professional protest that we've seen .WILLIAMS: . that these were --FRANCIS: . in so many countries -- in so many communities where it's people out to start trouble.WILLIAMS: OK.FRANCIS: And they organize to take down cities.WILLIAMS: Remember, Trump said in Chicago --FRANCIS: These are not people that are going to go vote democrat.WILLIAMS: I don't what they have. I mean I don't know if they are even legal cities .FRANCIS: I don't think they're going to vote at all.WILLIAMS: . if you want to argue that. But I'm saying, Trump said back in Chicago, he thought they were Bernie Sanders supporters. I don't think they're Bernie Sanders supporters, but I do think that we have a pattern here.GUTFELD: It could be gangs.WILLIAMS: That they are Mexican- Americans who is feel that they are being defamed by Donald Trump.GUTFELD: A lot of people don't like the politics of other people.WILLIAMS: Right.GUTFELD: They don't go out and sucker punch people.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: And that's wrong.GUTFELD: By the way, even more unusual, is they did this in the presence of cops. Imagine what they would do if there weren't any cops there.GUILFOYLE: The cops got pushed too.GUTFELD: Those -- that woman wouldn't just have been egged. What would have happened to that woman .GUILFOYLE: Terrible.GUTFELD: . surrounded by a group of young men? What would happen? Let your mind think about that if there were no cops.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, but he's -- the problem, Juan, with what you're saying is --GUTFELD: We're the feminist.GUILFOYLE: The causal connection that the language, you know begets the violence and therefore is justified, and that, I totally disagree with.GUTFELD: Right.GUILFOYLE: This is -- they're like two separate discussions. He may have said certain things of how in any way does that justify what you see? These are people using this as an excuse to commit lawless acts of violence, and commit assaultive attacks on women, and they punch the other guy and his head is bleeding. I mean, it's ridiculous.WILLIAMS: OK. So let me, let me make my point.GUILFOYLE: There's no excuse for that.WILLIAMS: Allow me to respond.GUILFOYLE: Fine.WILLIAMS: I just think that when you have someone who makes provocative, angry, violent statements and demeans other people, when the other people then have some violence occur and some of these people -- I don't mean to say all; all these candidates have some people who are violent. I don't who is violent and who is not.GUTFELD: You could say that St. Martin (ph) is for hip hop music.WILLIAMS: If these people --BOLLING: Or basketball .WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: . a sports or trashing talking to the court .WILLIAMS: Right, so you have some of these people .BOLLING: Or hockey.WILLIAMS: . and then you have Trump saying these things about, oh yeah, I'll defend people who act violently in my behalf. Gee, why wouldn't someone think Donald Trump maybe bears some responsibility?GUILFOYLE: That's not --BOLLING: Can we be honest about is he said that --GUILFOYLE: That's not an accurate thing.BOLLING: And he walked it back .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . after he said that.WILLIAMS: Oh.BOLLING: He said no more violence at our --WILLIAMS: He said --BOLLING: And by the way --WILLIAMS: He didn't just say it once, right?BOLLING: Look at what's happened. It went from blaming Trump for his, his supporters being violent to. It -- the completely opposite going on now where Trump supporters are the peaceful people walking around and they're getting cold-cocked.WILLIAMS: I don't --FRANCIS: And it's still his fault.WILLIAMS: I have said --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I don't like the violence by anybody, but you know that Trump has said, doesn't he wish he had the old days where some of these protesters could be carried or I'll pay the legal bills .BOLLING: That was --WILLIAMS: . if you hit one of these protesters.BOLLING: . when someone got hurt --WILLIAMS: Oh, please.BOLLING: And he walked that one back. You know that he won't walk that back.GUILFOYLE: I just, I just think when you think about what happened that -- I think it was so horrible; that was eggs, it was tomatoes .BOLLING: Bottles.GUILFOYLE: Bottles on that .WILLIAMS: Right. It's wrong.GUILFOYLE: . one particular woman surrounded by the men with the Mexican flag. I mean, it is so outrageous to me. I can't even tell you. Like they should be arrested and put in jail, and made an example of for their -- that is criminal conduct, there's no excuse for it.GUTFELD: And also, think about this, because there was -- it didn't seem like there were any consequences. Think about Cleveland, that's only about a month away. There's going to be a lot of people there. There's going to be a lot of people we know there, Juan, and they're going to be vulnerable. And are you going to say --BOLLING: Target.GUTFELD: They're going to be targets. And it's like, you know, if you don't condemn this now, if you don't stop this now, it's going to only get worse. And I think it's going to get worse because you're going to seeing peaceful people defend themselves. And I have a feeling there's a lot of Trump's supporters who know how to defend themselves.WILLIAMS: Well, fine. I mean, I don't know what you're suggesting here. I think we should condemn --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: . ugly.WILLIAMS: We should condemn all of these (inaudible). We should condemn Sanders people when they get involved with violence.FRANCIS: He's not condoning violence.WILLIAMS: But, that's what I say.GUILFOYLE: We are.WILLIAMS: Nobody, but --FRANCIS: Yeah.WILLIAMS: But --FRANCIS: Everybody (inaudible).WILLIAMS: And in this discussion there's a reluctance to say, hey guess what, there's a provocateur right in the middle of it, every time.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Provocation is they protected speech.FRANCIS: But also --BOLLING: And be what we we're all about. We're all about being creating debate, dialogue, getting information out; when you're being provocative. But Juan --WILLIAMS: No, no. no. There's a difference.BOLLING: Juan --WILLIAMS: A provocateur, I'm saying is someone who is saying --BOLLING: You know what finds me to you --WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: That I provoke you?WILLIAMS: How often do we sit here and argue? But I'm saying --BOLLING: Geraldo --GUILFOYLE: Everyday.BOLLING: Geraldo is another story, but --WILLIAMS: Not me and you. But I'm say something that what we see here is if that you're telling me that my parents are criminals and rapists. Maybe I would have some harsh feelings.FRANCIS: I don't think you would get violent.WILLIAMS: Not me. I agree with you.GUTFELD: I'm against violence, but I'm really pro self-defense.GUILFOYLE: All right. I'll do it for you lately.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Just squirm around a little bit. All right, directly ahead, Donald Trump fires back to Hillary Clinton after she attacked his credibility in foreign policy platform. Is this a preview of the fireworks we can expect in the general election? And later, it's Facebook Friday, so go to facebook.com/thefivefnc and post a question or two for us now. We just might answer it, live -- back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Hillary Clinton railed against Donald Trump during her so-called foreign policy speech yesterday. Here's a piece.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different, they are dangerously incoherent. Making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And then that went on and on and on. Well Hillary, be careful when you poke a bear, because he tends to fight back. Here's Trump, just a fewer hours later fighting back at Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I watched Hillary today, it was pathetic. It was supposed to be a foreign policy speech, it was political speech; had nothing to do with foreign policy. Anything Obama wants, she's going forward with, because you know why? She doesn't want to go to jail. Hillary Clinton has to go to jail, OK? She has to go to jail. She's guilty as hell. Crooked Hillary said, ""Oh, Donald Trump, his finger on the button."" She's the one that stupidly raised her hand to go into Iraq and destabilized the entire Middle East; Lyin', Crooked Hillary.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I love this thing, but she's a liar.(END VIDEO CLIP)(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Wow.BOLLING: KG, is this Lyin', L-Y --GUILFOYLE: L-Y- I -N - apostrophe --BOLLING: Crooked Hillary.GUILFOYLE: Crooked Hillary. Yeah, he took it from Cruz and now --GUTFELD: Yeah. He said something back. He's --GUILFOYLE: Yeah, but wouldn't you? Because it was a whole, that was like, not a foreign policy speech, right? It was just a let's bash Trump speech. Well, the problem is you must not have anything to talk about for yourself, because you spent 45 minutes talking about the other guy. One, it shows she's very concerned about him. Two, she's trying to amp (ph) up for supporters to get, and by the way, because she's in a crisis in California, which she should have been winning handedly. She's still struggling to like, deliver a knockout punch to a socialist. So things aren't going so great for her, and then she sees record numbers turnout, you know, for Donald Trump, because a tremendous amount of enthusiasm and she's battling an enthusiasm gap, for sure.BOLLING: Juan, politically, this speech, that speech came a couple of days prior to California, Bernie Sanders is now in a deadlock with her California. Even if she -- even if he wins California, she loses, she'll still get the nomination, but is this the time she should have pivoted to Donald Trump that soon? Or should she have waited until she gets the nomination?WILLIAMS: No, no. I think it was a good move because it suggests to voters in California that, in fact, Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to go you up against Donald Trump. She delivered what I thought was a terrific speech, and she suggested to the voters, democratic voters the same thing that Jerry Brown, the governor of California did, which is, we like Bernie Sanders, but we're really concerned about Donald Trump.BOLLING: What about the fight back? Was it effective? Was Donald Trump effective?FRANCIS: I mean, you know, he did the normal thing that he always does. I don't think that was any different than anything he did before. But on her speech, in terms of wanting to be a great speech on foreign policy, I mean her entire foreign policy was he's a psycho. I mean that's all that it really amounted too, and this idea -- I mean, she was secretary of state. She should have been able to outline for exact things that she wanted to do. Instead, I mean it goes back to the same thing, what would you say is her number one achievement as secretary of state? What's the thing she should be proudest of in foreign policy?WILLIAMS: I could list a bunch of things, but I don't get it. I mean you think that -- for example, Donald Trump says, why did we go into Libya? That was her mistake. Or why did we get involved with Iraq? He backed both of these things. Both of them, but now he says, that's evidence of her incompetence --FRANCIS: But Libya is supposed to be her strongest point. I mean, and all she did there was to create a vacuum. And then yesterday in her speech, she said we can't go ahead and create vacuums. That's exactly what she did in Libya.BOLLING: Greg, is it -- can she get a, take a victory lap for a foreign policy a win over Donald Trump when she's got Benghazi, she's got Syria, she's got China --GUTFELD: No. I mean this --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: This is why this battle, which is so unusual. Trump's advantage is having no track record in (inaudible) where track record matters. Foreign policy, you're supposed to have experience. Hillary is so bad, that people prefer the person who doesn't have any experience .FRANCIS: True.GUILFOYLE: Oh, true.GUTFELD: Over somebody who was there for years. I mean, it is kind of a grim spectacle when you have a candidate who is careless about security, versus a candidate who poses or admires dictators. It's kind of strange and scary. The unknown, unknown of Trump is more appealing than the known failure that is Hillary.BOLLING: A top former intelligence official who served in the Obama administration taking issue with Hillary Clinton's speech, saying she's in no position to criticize anyone.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL FLYNN, FORMER DIA DIRECTOR: She talked about people who are dangerous. I mean, a secretary of state who lies to the American public. A secretary of state who uses an unsecure e-mail server, you look at some of the actions that she was directly involved in, the rise of the Islamic state, the failure of Libya, the failure of the Russian reset, the Iranian nuclear deal which she was directly involved in Yemen. I mean, there are so many things that she touched that are just utter failures.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, bring it this way, Greg.GUTFELD: Yeah. I mean .BOLLING: Yeah.GUTFELD: He's an expert.BOLLING: Yeah. Melissa?FRANCIS: Yes.(LAUGHTER)FRANCIS: No, I mean, he listed it right there and instead, those should be her accomplishments. I mean that was she spent all the time as secretary of state. She should be able to stand up there in a foreign policy speech and say, here with the five things that I did that were fantastic, that I will now put forward as president and advance to make the world a better place. Instead, she's trying to deflect from her own terrible record by saying look, no matter how bad I am, he's a psycho. So you better be .GUILFOYLE: I know --FRANCIS: . really careful, bad is better than psycho.BOLLING: Can I throw this to Juan? Experience yes, competency, not so much.WILLIAMS: Oh gee, maybe we should tell bin Laden? Oh, she's incompetent. She didn't support that.BOLLING: What? Wait, wait, what?WILLIAMS: She didn't support going after and killing bin Laden? No, no. She didn't do that. How about those two awards the republicans got to said, hmm, she wasn't involved in getting us extricated from these terrible messes over killing --FRANCIS: Getting us out of Iraq is a good thing?WILLIAMS: Oh --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Getting us out of Iraq --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Yes, getting us out of Iraq.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Oh, so now we're having a conversation. A minute ago, you guys couldn't think of anything she had done.GUILFOYLE: If Hillary --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Oh, I'll keep going.BOLLING: . that said that's she's confident?GUILFOYLE: Hillary voted for Iraq.WILLIAMS: I know you're right, Eric --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: You want -- you know what?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: All right, go ahead, KG.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: It's ridiculous. She voted for Iraq, by the way. So let me just tell you something. She just put a big old pearl choker of Arab Spring around her neck, because, you know, she built that. That's what she --WILLIAMS: Arab Spring was a good thing.GUILFOYLE: No, it wasn't.WILLIAMS: Oh, no?GUILFOYLE: Look what happened in the aftermath.WILLIAMS: Oh, I --GUILFOYLE: It was complete disability --GUTFELD: It could have been a good thing.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I think Arab Spring was a good thing.GUTFELD: Because she -- because the Obama administration did not support the Iranians during the green revolution, they let it go. That was a mistake.WILLIAMS: No, but the question was .GUILFOYLE: The problem is --WILLIAMS: . nation building. Are we -- you want us to get us --GUILFOYLE: Juan, she doesn't have .FRANCIS: Are we done?GUILFOYLE: . one foreign policy accomplishment or anything that has benefitted us as it relates to national security.WILLIAMS: Oh, I see.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: You missed bin Laden.GUILFOYLE: He doesn't.WILLIAMS: I can see that.BOLLING: You didn't hear that.GUILFOYLE: Oh, OK.BOLLING: Hillary Clinton is responsible for killing bin Laden.GUILFOYLE: I know.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It has nothing to do with --WILLIAMS: She was -- wait a minute.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: She was secretary of state --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: She went after, not only, she went after Gaddafi.BOLLING: Groundwork for killing bin Laden.WILLIAMS: I see. Oh --GUILFOYLE: And too bad --WILLIAMS: Oh, there we go. Oh, I see it.GUILFOYLE: And too bad, her husband missed the opportunity to take him out when he could have as well. How about that?WILLIAMS: Oh, sour grape.BOLLING: Up next.(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: . under his presidency. But today's new jobs report tells a vastly different story. We'll break down the economic spin, when we return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Two days ago, President Obama touted the economy during his speech in Indiana.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: By almost every economic measure, America is better off than when I came here --(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: At the beginning of my presidency. That's the truth. Over the past six years, our businesses have created more than 14 million new jobs. That's the longest stretch of consecutive private-sector job growth in our history. We've seen the first sustained manufacturing growth since the 1990s. We cut unemployment in half.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: But new numbers out today, for the month of May, say the economy created the fewest number of jobs in more than five years. Just 38,000 jobs were added last month. Economists anticipated more than four times that number. We have a business expert with us today, Melissa?(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: Economists don't know anything. We all know that.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: I mean they anticipated so many more. Now I mean, this was, it was a terrible report. There's, I mean, there's no way to put lipstick on this pig. I mean, you look at it, we're only 25,000 jobs were created in the private sector. I feel like Juan is going to mention that the unemployment number dropped. We have --WILLIAMS: Oh --FRANCIS: Wait, wait.WILLIAMS: To be honest, it comes out.FRANCIS: Wait, wait.WILLIAMS: Yes, oh right ahead.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: The unemployment number dropped because half a million people dropped out of the workforce and gave up and stopped looking for jobs.WILLIAMS: You think maybe they're getting older? And we have a lot of people retiring?FRANCIS: I'm so glad you brought that up.WILLIAMS: There you go. Yeah.FRANCIS: Because I looked at the CBO data on that.WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.FRANCIS: And it's -- that accounts for one and a half percent.WILLIAMS: OK.FRANCIS: That's how many of the labor forces .WILLIAMS: Right.FRANCIS: . participation rate, one and a half percent .WILLIAMS: And what accounts for consumer confident --FRANCIS: . of that rise is because people are --WILLIAMS: What accounts for the longest recovery --FRANCIS: Is getting over it. So that --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It's a rapture.WILLIAMS: It's a rapture. But you know, Melissa --FRANCIS: That older people doesn't work. That's the --WILLIAMS: When I suggested that you were the --FRANCIS: One and a half percent.WILLIAMS: The financial expert on the panel.FRANCIS: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Gregory looked like I had, you know, pulled his pants down. So go right ahead, Greg.GUILFOYLE: We're talking about Bolling.WILLIAMS: Oh, Bolling was offended too?GUILFOYLE: Oh my, God.BOLLING: Why don't you watch this show just about every Saturday called, ""Cashin' In.""GUILFOYLE: ""Cashin' In.""(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: And he had a business panel show called, ""Follow the Money.""WILLIAMS: No, you're right.BOLLING: No, no --WILLIAMS: You're right.GUILFOYLE: And he (inaudible) on ""Wall Street.""BOLLING: I defer.GUTFELD: No, (inaudible) -- robots.WILLIAMS: Robots what?GUTFELD: Robots, none of these matters. It's going --WILLIAMS: Oh my, God.GUTFELD: The biggest change is going to be happening in about 10 years, we're arguing over this stuff? This is nothing. And by the way, colleges are churning out majors that have no practical application in the future. If you are majoring in gender studies right now and not robotics, you might as well major in how to create horse-drawn carriages, because that's about all it's worth these days. We are not preparing young people for this historical change that's going to take place when automation is going to eliminate a lot of jobs.You've got to stop learn -- you've got to stop enjoying technology and start learning how to create it, or you're jobless.WILLIAMS: You mean this doesn't matter? The politics don't matter? You just think we're in a bad position?FRANCIS: No, no...WILLIAMS: Things are changing.FRANCIS: Did you see the story today about Wal-Mart flying drones over the warehouse, and the drones go out and they can do in one day what it takes humans to do a month? They're replacing humans in the warehouse.GUTFELD: There's going to be a ""Robotic Five.""WILLIAMS: ""The Robotic Five.""FRANCIS: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: Eric. Eric.GUILFOYLE: It's already here.WILLIAMS; You were right; you were right. He's not a financial expert. You -- I should have gone to you.BOLLING: You don't remember this, but maybe...FRANCIS: That was a good point (ph), actually.BOLLING: ... about a month ago, I said here's a liberal talking point that you can really use.WILLIAMS: What was that?BOLLING: This number of labor participation rate...WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: ... 94 million people have left the -- are not in the labor force right now.WILLIAMS: Right, right, right.BOLLING: A lot of it is because of automation, robotics. They're taking over. Instead of, you know, putting your order into a human being, now you're putting it into a robot. That's what -- that's some of it. Some of it's retiring or whatnot.But President Obama saying that things are so great right now. Yes, they're great for Wall Street. He's right about that.WILLIAMS: He's right.BOLLING: But they're not great for the income inequality that the left wants to -- wants to say...WILLIAMS: That's true.BOLLING: ... that they're all about.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: It's widened under President Obama. You know, the rich are getting richer.FRANCIS: Yes.BOLLING: The poor are getting poorer, relatively speaking.WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: And that is the real fatal flaw in Obama-nomics.WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: Salaries aren't going up. People aren't getting...(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I want to give Kimberly a chance to become a financial expert.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: To knock one out of the park.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: Because Kimberly, here's my -- my response from a liberal point of view, which is...GUILFOYLE: OK, Juan.WILLIAMS: ... we've had the longest recovery. Right? So does that deserve some credit?GUILFOYLE: Listen, this is a huge problem. Even though the Hillary supporters are on television today saying this is not good, because she's tied directly to President Obama. Obama's economy, that dog don't hunt.Here's the issue now: So you have someone like Donald Trump, who is somebody who's proved himself in the economy, as a job creator, who's been very successful. If you couple that with the exit polls that show that the economy is the No. 1 issue...WILLIAMS: No. 1.GUILFOYLE: ... for people coming out to vote.WILLIAMS: I agree.GUILFOYLE: And they're dissatisfied. People are very unhappy with the direction of the country, with the direction of their pocketbooks and their wallets.So when you see that, you have to say, ""Who has the ability to create jobs and get us out of this economic slump?""Well, if you ask Hillary, she's like, ""Oh, I'm going to bring Bill back. Bill knows, and he's going to do something about the economy.""WILLIAMS: Well, you know, actually on that point...GUILFOYLE: She's already saying that she's not qualified, doesn't have the ideas to do it.FRANCIS: He's going to do it.WILLIAMS: But you know...GUILFOYLE: She's got to rely on Bill Clinton. And you have got the guy on the other side saying, ""Listen, I know how to create jobs.""WILLIAMS: Well, I was just going to say to you, in fact, when you ask people, you're exactly right. No. 1 issue is the economy, and Trump has the advantage on that issue.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: Juan, Juan, Juan. Question.WILLIAMS: Yes, sir.GUTFELD: You were talking about this being the longest recovery.WILLIAMS: Right.GUTFELD: Shouldn't recoveries, the best part -- best kind of recovery be short?FRANCIS: Juan...WILLIAMS: Yes, but do you think a recovery is...GUTFELD: A short recovery is great.WILLIAMS: Don't you think a recovery...GUTFELD: You get better faster.WILLIAMS: ... a recovery beats the alternative?GUILFOYLE: Finally, short prevails, Greg.FRANCIS: No, not when it's the worst recovery in history.WILLIAMS: Worst? The longest. How is the longest the worst?FRANCIS: No, it's the worst.GUTFELD: Good point.FRANCIS: The St. Louis Fed, you should follow them on Twitter; it's like porn for nerds. It's fantastic.WILLIAMS: Porn for nerds.FRANCIS: All kinds of data. They will tell you...WILLIAMS: Can you say (ph) that?FRANCIS: It's the worst recovery on record -- that's the St. Louis Fed -- in terms of GDP growth. The worst ever.WILLIAMS: You know, Eric is doing well in this recovery. I'm going to tell you that.Ahead, is the key to raising good, responsible kids as simple as giving them chores? That's what one mom is saying. ""The Five's"" take on that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FRANCIS: As parents we sometimes wonder what we could do to make sure our children become productive and well-adjusted members of society. It turns out the key may actually be one of the things kids complain about the most: doing chores. But their gripes might not be such a bad thing.In an essay titled ""Good Parents Give Chores,"" a Wisconsin mother named Kim Sullivan points out, quote, ""A child whining is, in fact, a kind of validation that we're on the right track. So I guess if I think of it that way, I get quite a bit of reinforcement for what I'm doing as a mom.""Eric Bolling, you have a fantastic son heading off for college. I've known you for a long time. You're an incredibly hard-working individual, very disciplined. Do you give your kids chores -- your son chores?BOLLING: No. And that is lag. He works. He works weekdays, goes to school during the week and works weekends.But I think the most important piece of advice I can give is make sure there's a study time. Listen, the way schools are going now, they're not really required to study after school. It's becoming easier and easier. You've just got to carve out a pattern where they know, at the end of the day, they come home, and whether it's 45 minutes, an hour or two, whatever your thing is, just so there's a set -- develop the pattern. And I think it will last forever.He's done extremely well. Once I backed off, he was just self-motivated with that.FRANCIS: So it's interesting that you would say that, because that was one of the discussions in here, is that parents were making the choices between -- there was a science fair project coming up. And they're, like, you have to work on the science fair and let the chores go to the wayside. They felt like the chores were more important.Juan, Eric obviously disagrees with that.BOLLING: Can I -- no. I'm sorry. I said I lacked in doing that. I never required him to do that, and I think I should have. But I emphasized the other thing.FRANCIS: Yes.WILLIAMS: I think this is a discussion for middle-class parents, because I know I see some so often poor kids or, you know, working-class kids. They want the money. So they'll get the part-time job. But then they're not doing the homework; they're not doing the extracurricular stuff. And they think, ""Oh, you know, I'm bringing money into the house."" And I really want them to achieve academically. I want them to achieve as athletes, as Eric was saying.It's not that I'm excusing them from having responsibility, these chores in the house, Melissa.FRANCIS: Right.WILLIAMS: But I just don't think that you want them to somehow think that, you know, the job is more important than the investment in their long-term future.FRANCIS: I think the point is that they're supposed to be pulling their weight around the house, that things don't get magically done. And in addition to doing school and going to work and whatever else, we all have to pull together in the house to get it done.Kimberly, did you do a lot of chores growing up?GUILFOYLE: Yes. Always. I didn't have to be told to or paid. I just thought it was the right thing to do. Honestly, I liked doing dishes. I liked taking out the garbage. I liked getting things organized.FRANCIS: I can imagine you doing that.GUILFOYLE: Yes. Groceries.BOLLING: In the Louboutins.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I know. That's what Ronan said that time with the cooking with Kimberly -- you know, ""Cooking with FOX and Friends,"" and he's like, ""Mommy makes me oatmeal in her heels."" Hey, well, why not? It's getting done, isn't it?The point is, it's important to have a routine and have discipline. It's like Ronan comes home, he knows what he's got to do. He's got to do his homework. Then he gets to, like, play a little bit. He has dinner. Then it's time for shower. And you know, he is responsible for himself. He sets his alarm, like 6:30 a.m. to get up. And another reminder one, you know, 7:30 and then 8. It's like, ""OK, hey, let's go; it's time to roll.""FRANCIS: Greg, you're a model citizen.GUTFELD: That is true.FRANCIS: Obviously, you always have been. Your parents must have done something right along the way. Did they drive you to do chores?GUTFELD: Yes, I had...FRANCIS: Slave labor?GUTFELD: ... they had very creative chores for me. Because there's a lot of things a kid can do that doesn't bring attention to them if an adult had done it.For example, it's easier for me to steal a bone-in ribeye from a supermarket as a 5-year-old than my parents. I was able to photograph sunbathers in the park for my father. And it didn't -- it didn't cause any -- arouse any attention.WILLIAMS: Yes.GUTFELD: And I could sell them, depending on the angle and quality, for a few dollars.GUILFOYLE: Arouse, good choice of words.WILLIAMS: Yes, I noticed it.GUTFELD: I'm glad you -- and by the way, civilization is crumbling. The idea of chores versus no chores, that's the least of our problems. We should be worrying about intact households, where there might be a mom and a dad there. Let's worry about that first.GUILFOYLE: I agree, yes.WILLIAMS: Good point.GUTFELD: Thank you.WILLIAMS: Good point.GUTFELD: And I don't even have kids.FRANCIS: Yes, there you go.WILLIAMS: Well, bless you.BOLLING: What a waste.GUILFOYLE: I mean, really.BOLLING: Can you come over and help us out?GUILFOYLE: Can you imagine the parenting there?BOLLING: Rent yourself out.GUTFELD: I don't want kids ruining my life. I have a great life.WILLIAMS: He could be -- he could be your nanny.FRANCIS: Is that a flower in your clipboard?GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. Look at his clipboard.GUTFELD: You don't -- you don't want me to babysit.FRANCIS: We've got to go. All right.GUTFELD: I actually do sit on them.GUILFOYLE: No wonder you...(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: ""Facebook Friday"" -- that was good -- is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC: THEME FROM ""M*A*S*H, ""SUICIDE IS PAINLESS)GUILFOYLE: ""Suicide is Painless."" All right. That's the name of the song.Question from Tracy S. for ""Facebook Friday."" I'm going to start with you and go around, K.G.

So OK.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: First, like, car date?GUTFELD: First car date. Whatever.GUILFOYLE: OK. Like a real date. OK, so I was probably 16.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: And I went out with a certain individual who had a car that was like red and white striped kind of thing...GUTFELD: Right.GUILFOYLE: ... with some horn that made the noise.GUTFELD: So it was Lou Dobbs. He picked me up in the same car. I don't remember anything, though. I got very, very confused.GUILFOYLE: And then we -- and then we went to the drive-through. Yes, the -- what do you call it? -- the drive-in. Yes.GUTFELD: The drive-in.GUILFOYLE: Then I was too embarrassed. He was, like, honking the horn, ""Doo-doo-doo doo-doo,"" like making a weird noise. So then I, like, pretended there was, like, a bird loose in my house that we had to catch.FRANCIS: A lot of detail.GUILFOYLE: And then I sat on the movie -- sat on the couch and watched a movie with my neighbor...GUTFELD: Wow.GUILFOYLE: ... and my date.GUTFELD: So now if he's watching this show, he'll know that that whole bird story was a lie.GUILFOYLE: It's actually kind of a problem for me, now that you've done this to me.GUTFELD: Exactly.All right, Juan.GUILFOYLE: My dad picked him. That's why. Even worse.GUTFELD: Juan.WILLIAMS: I don't know what, you know, what you define as a date. I mean, you know, like hanging out, let's go hang out.GUTFELD: No, an actual date. What you would consider, in your memory, to be a date.WILLIAMS: A date? I mean, like in high school -- like, I went to high school in upstate New York. And you'd say, ""Let's go down by the Friendly's,"" but then, of course, you have to wait for somebody to get the van. And you know...GUTFELD: Is ""Friendly's"" a nickname for something?FRANCIS: The van?GUTFELD: A body part?WILLIAMS: No. Ice cream. You never went to an ice -- Friendly's?GUTFELD: ""Let's go by the Friendly's.""WILLIAMS: In college...GUILFOYLE: That's awesome.WILLIAMS: ... I remember, like, taking a girl to a restaurant. That's a date. You know?GUTFELD: Yes. But you don't know the age?WILLIAMS: I was thinking about this recently, because it's prom season. And I saw something in the paper where it says, like, the big thing is you don't have to ask a girl, or the girl doesn't have to ask you. Everybody just goes to the prom.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: I thought, ""Hmm.""BOLLING: Eric Chase is at his prom as we speak.WILLIAMS: All right.BOLLING: At this very moment. They do go in groups now.WILLIAMS: Yes, that's what I was saying.BOLLING: And they all go to prom, and then they all go, like, to some place for the weekend and...GUILFOYLE: So fun.FRANCIS: For the weekend? Wow, we missed a lot.BOLLING: I will tell you the most -- yes, I know. The most memorable early date. I was 15 years old. I borrowed my father's car. He didn't know it. We went out on a date.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: The snow -- in Chicago. Freezing cold. During the date the snow started coming down, so the roads were slick. Pull up to a red light. My father's car. My girlfriend is right here, plowed in from behind. The car behind me plowed in. I'm 15. I can't -- stop. He takes off, and I pull over; and my dad has to pick us both up.GUTFELD: Oh, that's beautiful.BOLLING: Brutal, brutal.FRANCIS: What was the legal driving age? Not 15.BOLLING: I was not old enough to drive. That's why it was -- my dad had to pick me up instead of a cop.FRANCIS: Wow. This is a very intriguing story. You were quite the rebel.BOLLING: Kathy Acoula (ph).GUTFELD: Google her.FRANCIS: Very good.GUTFELD: All right.FRANCIS: I was 15. I don't have a good is story.GUTFELD: Yes.FRANCIS: That was it.GUTFELD: I kind of remember the age of the girl on the first date. I think she was 16. I was 29. Is that a problem?BOLLING: Not if she's 16.GUTFELD: Exactly.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: I can't remember which state it was. Anyway, I should look that up.GUILFOYLE: And which -- and which state lines you crossed.GUTFELD: Yes. We crossed four state lines, because I was on the run at the time.We'll go this way.FRANCIS: Uh-oh.GUTFELD: This is from Kristen B.: ""Who would play you in a movie?"" That's funny.

People used to say that I looked like that girl who -- she died, unfortunately, Brittany -- you know she was in...GUTFELD: Murphy.FRANCIS: Yes, Brittany Murphy.GUILFOYLE: Aw.FRANCIS: Which is not a compliment, because she had the kind of -- like, the crazy eyes, which you know, I don't know. People thought I looked like her...GUTFELD: She was very attractive.FRANCIS: Really?GUTFELD: Yes.FRANCIS: You'd take that as a compliment?GUILFOYLE: She went out with Ashton Kutcher.GUTFELD: Who didn't?GUILFOYLE: I didn't.FRANCIS: I don't know.

So tonight make sure you stay tuned. At 8 p.m. tonight, there's an ""O'Reilly"" special I'm hosting. It's called ""A Nation Divided: Left Versus Right in America."" And as we get further and further apart, there's one guy...GUILFOYLE: Mark CubanBOLLING: ... we talked about to be both a V.P. potential for Trump and/or -- not ""and"" -- or Hillary Clinton. Here's a little piece of that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: How is it possible that, with this growing divide -- that's what this special is about; there's a growing divide. It's a widening between the right and -- the political right and left in America -- one guy could possibly be named in either side? What do you bring that -- that no one else does?MARK CUBAN, ENTREPRENEUR: Well, first of all, I have a tech background, and neither of the candidates, right, have any technological expertise whatsoever. You know, Donald doesn't really use email. Obviously, Hillary doesn't use it well.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And then I asked him about all the protests and all the immigration stuff. It gets really in-depth, and it's pretty good.GUILFOYLE: Great, congratulations.GUTFELD: He should have worn a sport coat, though. A nice sport coat would have been nice.

I could have said, ""Whoa, that's a big alligator."" But no, I think ""That's a Giant Alligator,"" that best describes this video.GUILFOYLE: OK, it's my turn now.BOLLING: On a golf course.GUTFELD: On a golf course.BOLLING: In South Carolina.GUILFOYLE: It looks like it has terrible bloat.OK.

8	8	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/08/14/media-declare-trump-meltdown/	Media declare Trump 'meltdown'	"This is a rush transcript from ""Media Buzz,"" August 14, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On the buzzmeter this Sunday, Donald Trump accuses The New York Times of publishing fiction as the media establishment announces his rhetoric especially those comments on Hillary Clinton, judges and the Second Amendment. The latest firestorm from what he calls the dishonest press.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SCOTT PELLEY, CBS NEWS: Donald Trump spoke off the cuff and took his campaign off the rails, again.DAVID MUIR, ABC NEWS: Did Donald Trump cross the line?LESTER HOLT, NBC BEWS: We ought to start at home with Donald Trump and a potential new controversy simmering tonight after a remark that at best was a joke and at worst, as an implied threat of violence.JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: Let me say this to my Republican Party. You are letting Donald Trump destroy the party and you've done it from the beginning.MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: He is operating in an environment now where Mrs. Clinton and her campaign, the left of the media, is going to twist every single thing he says. He's got to understand he's got to be more precise with his language.DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS: Imagine if she had said or somebody had said that about Donald Trump. Vicariously, say, oh, maybe somebody will assassinate him. We would all be going crazy.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You don't say stuff like that that can be seen otherwise. And it's not the press, it's not the Democrats. This is a self-inflicted wound.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: There can be no other interpretation. Even reporters have told me. I mean, give me a break, but they're dishonest people.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: But should Trump now be accusing the Times of inventing unnamed sources and reporting that his campaign is flailing? Or are the mainstream media just piling on? New York Times media columnist admits the coverage of Trump is unbalanced but says that's understandable because many journalists heard as potentially dangerous. Really?New e-mail show influence peddling and favor seeking between Hillary Clinton and the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. But is that story being drowned out by the uproar over Trump?Plus, NBC and other media outlets under fire for belittling or a sexist coverage of female athletes at the Olympics. We'll have a scorecard. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is ""MediaBuzz.""Donald Trump's campaign was already awash in negative media coverage when the spotlight suddenly shifted from a major economic speech to Republicans bailing on his campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)JAMIE GANGEL, CNN: Bottom line, do you think he was -- it would be dangerous if he was president?SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, R-MAINE: Donald Trump in my judgment would make a perilous world even more dangerous.JAKE TAPPER, CNN: You just called Donald Trump a clear and present danger.GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: Well, if he governs in any way close to the language that he has used in the campaign, I fear for our future.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: But that was wiped off the media air when Trump went to a North Carolina rally and made this attack.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Hillary wants to abolish -- essentially abolish the second amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick -- if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the second amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know, but -- but I'll tell you what, that will be a horrible day.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Trump riled up the press again by calling Clinton a founder of ISIS and then last night he said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The New York Times, okay, I love them and they wrote a story today, anonymous sources have said -- three anonymous sources, anonymous this, anonymous that. They don't use names. I don't really think they have any names, okay?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us now to analyze the campaign coverage, Heidi Przybyla, senior political correspondent for USA Today, Lisa Boothe, a Republican strategist and a contributor to the Washington Examiner, and Kirsten Powers, Fox News contributor and a columnist for the USA Today. Heidi, that New York Times story that Trump was calling fiction quoted a lot of anonymous source said, ""He remains a crudely effective political showman but aides think he may be beyond coaching and is not a plausible president. Your take on the story and Trump's response?HEIDI PRZYBYSLA, USA TODAY SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: It's obviously a story that was not just reported overnight, Howie, and it wasn't just four anonymous sources over the course of however long they've been reporting it. This is an evolution that we've all been watching in terms of Trump's advisers trying to get him to do things that maybe he didn't do during the primary campaign.That said, it comes in the midst of what is undoubtedly a media pile on, and so I think Trump kind of took this one story and is reacting to it in a very emotional way in going after the New York Times, but the truth of the matter is, Howie, to report -- and you know this -- to report a story like this, you have to use anonymous sources. People who are in the campaign and who are worried about the direction of the campaign are not going to tell you that on the record.So, that's the only way that a story like this can be reported. That's why I think that deeper in the body of the story the Times did mention that they had talked to 20 people.KURTZ: In fairness to the ""Times,"" there were three Trump advisors like Rudy Giuliani recorded on the record as well as the campaign communications director, but this kind of -- I mean, Trump is basically saying this is Jayson Blaire territory, making stuff up, as opposed to just saying the story isn't true. What's your take Lisa?LISA BOOOTHE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Look, I think the New York Times, as has most of the media, essentially discredited themselves in this election cycle. The Republicans have worked in campaign, clearly there's been bias, you know, throughout a large period of time with newspapers and other publications, but I think we've seen they've been utterly transparent in their bias this election cycle.I think this is the reason why 20 percent of Americans have confidence in newspapers because it does -- they're saying that people that are close to the campaign or have some sort of communication with the campaign that could be anyone. Who are these unnamed sources? And I think the New York Times has already discredited themselves this election cycle.They ran a story about women and Donald Trump and one of the interviewees actually stepped forth and said that her words were taken out of context, that it was not true, that she was misled by the reporter himself. If you look at the fact that the New York Times ran an almost 1,300 page article on his second amendment comments but did nothing about a terrorist father attending or endorsing Hillary Clinton.KURTZ: We'll get to that in a sec.BOOTHE: But they've shown their bias this election cycle.KURTZ: A Trump campaign insider told me, Kirsten Powers that this is a case of people at least close to Trump, if not within the campaign itself, who are kind of distancing themselves from what they fear will be a loss in November, the fact that these leaks are taking place, we don't know who the sources are, what does that tell you about the relationship between the campaign and the media?KIRSTEN POWERS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I mean, obviously the campaign -- people in the campaign are panicking a little bit. We know this from other reporting, but just so this idea about the New York Times being so biased, look, I mean they're not a perfect newspaper, but I wouldn't put his second amendment comments on the same level as some person showing up at Hillary Clinton rally with -- somebody who she basically said she didn't want his support. It's not really the same thing.KURTZ: And again, we'll have more on that coming up.POWERS: The only thing I would -- the only thing I would say here is I've known Maggie Habermann for, I don't know, 15 years probably. She's covered campaigns that I've worked on. I know her well. She's a first-rate reporter.The idea that somehow she's making up sources here is beyond preposterous and also the New York Times I know has a very rigorous process. They don't get to just make up sources. They don't get to just say somebody said something. That's just not the way it works there. It's not...BOOTHE: But who were those sources? I mean they could be people on the lower tier that have no involvement, who have never even sat in a room with Donald Trump. We don't know who those are.POWERS: I know, but a good reporter isn't going to just take an intern and quote them.BOOTHE: But I the New York Times has already discredited themselves.POWERS: I don' think that that's true. I think that's actually kind of character assassination against a great reporter.KURTZ: Well, the story said that four of the sources had detailed knowledge of certain meetings which had seemed to be pretty closely. Now, by the way, Trump said that he might yank the credential of the New York Times. He told me that two months ago. He doesn't seem to want to do it. It's his hometown paper.He has a special reverence even thought he's not rather disgusted with it, right. What consumed a lot of media oxygen this week obviously were the second amendment comments. You've all seen and heard it, but here's an interview that Trump did with radio host Hugh Hewitt, conservative radio host, in which Hewitt pressed him on the nature of those comments. Take a look.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)HUGH HEWITT, CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST: Last night you said the president was the founder of ISIS. I know what you meant. You meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.TRUMP: No, I meant he's the founder of ISIS. I do. He is the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.HEWITT: But he's not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He's trying to kill themTRUMP: I don't care, he is the founder.(END AUDIO CLIP)KURTZ: So, this seems to me to fall into the category of the political license. I mean, does anyone really believe that Trump is a literally saying that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS? At the same time, CNN put up a banner that actually basically called Trump a liar saying he isn't, meaning Obama, isn't the founder of ISI. What do you make of this?PRZYBYLA: This is part of a broader change that we've had to make in this campaign cycle about covering Donald Trump, which is that a lot of the statements that he says that are not sarcasm, because he later said this is sarcasm, are just factually incorrect so the news organizations have taken to live fact checking. In this case, he later came back and said, well, that was sarcastic, but he said it on so many occasions that we as the media have to report that what he's saying is literal when he tells us that it's literal in several interviews as he did.KURTZ: Let's put up the tweet where Trump said because he was criticizing CNN's coverage of it, ""Ratings challenged CNN report so seriously that I call President Obama and Clinton the founder of ISIS & MVP. They don't get sarcasm?"" But Lisa, then on O'Reilly after that he said, ""Well, obviously I'm being sarcastic but not that sarcastic."" So what is the media to make of where this falls on the sarcasm?BOOTHE: The problem is CNN also doesn't do that fact checking element when Hillary Clinton rarely does interviews, when she actually does interviews, even though we know that Hillary Clinton has systematically and methodically lied to the American people for a year and a half throughout the FBI's investigation. So, you know, that's the problem here. And then further, you know, I think there was a level of hyperbole to his statement that...KURTZ: Of course.BOOTHE: But the crux of what he is saying is that President Obama left a vacuum for ISIS. This is something that has been reiterated by someone like Leon Panetta who served under President Obama who has said on record that President Obama leaving Iraq left a vacuum for ISIS.KURTZ: That's a fair...BOOTHE: It was something that was reiterated by his own defense secretary.KURTZ: That's a fair charge. Well, Hugh Hewitt gave him the opportunity to say that he's -- no, I'm saying founder of ISIS.BOOTHE: And I think (inaudible) there's a level of...KURTZ: Yes.POWERS: He also said it at least seven times, I mean, so why did he not just say that at some point, what Lisa just said. Why didn't he, in all those other times just explain that? That's not what he did. And then he said it was sarcasm. So, I feel like the people who want to clean up his mess are saying that's what he meant, but he's not saying that.KURTZ: Let me read you a tweet that I showed just before we came on the air. Again this is the @realDonaldTrump account on Twitter. ""If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20 percent.""POWERS: Yeah. Well, so here's the thing. I have sat on this set and said that I thought the media was hard on Trump many months ago. I cannot sit here today and say that anyone's being hard on him in this situation. He has...KURTZ: Not being hard on him or that he was saying it's justified?POWERS: Unfairly hard. I think they were maybe, you know, going overboard with him. When he's coming out and saying the kinds of things he's saying and then trying to tell us that its sarcasm, it's moving into a realm that I think is getting a little crazy...BOOTHE: But the point -- I think there's an important point that's missing here though. The media should be able to cover what Donald Trump says and I have said before that I think he overstates things, you know, and so I don't completely put that on the media.KURTZ: He creates some of his own problems.BOOTHE: Yes, to some extent, yes. I've conceded that before. But the problem is the media should be adept enough to be able to cover that while simultaneously covering the stuff that Hillary Clinton has, but there's not an equal amount of fact checking. There's not an equal amount of criticism that's being applied to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. You should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.PRZYBYLA: Look, political (ph) fact that a mid-year review, like a roundup of all of the statements...(CROSSTALK)PRZYBYLA: ...and 70 percent of the statements by Trump were false compared to 20 something percent by Hillary Clinton.KURTZ: Let me jump in there because we're short on time. We will get into Hillary Clinton on a segment later in the program. I just want to put up this Time Magazine cover this week, ""Meltdown"" and you see the melting face. So, that seems to me like...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Great picture.KURTZ: ...the mainstream media have now concluded that not only is Trump behind and he is creating a lot of problems to himself, he's going to lose this campaign. And I wonder if that is a trap that we're falling into since it is August.PRZYBLA: They have accused him -- let's go take a walk down memory lane here -- of melting down, those exact words, on several occasions. And ""Time"" has, you know, likes to push the envelope with its covers. I saw one about Hillary Clinton, you know, back during the e-mail scandal that was pretty provocative before there was even an investigation.You know, that said, I think, you know, we have to wait for several more weeks of polling as well as look at other factors like the fact that he is still taking in a lot of money before we can necessarily all kind of jump on that melting down bandwagon. But I think when you are struggling like you are in the poll numbers right now, you're going to invite headlines.KURTZ: All right, let me get a break here. We will come back to this a little later with you panel. Also, continue the conversation on Twitter, @howardurtz. Write to us, mediabuzz@foxnews.com -- they normally come back.Are some pundits using the latest polls to predict that Trump is actually toast? Trish Regan is up next. And later, is all the Trump, Trump, Trump coverage overshadowing Hillary Clinton's latest e-mail mess?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Is the poll-obsessed press starting to write off Donald Trump? I put that question to Trish Regan, host of ""The Intelligence Report"" at 2 p.m. Eastern on Fox Business from New York.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Trish Regan, welcome.TRISH REGAN, FBN HOST, ""INTELLIGENCE REPORT"": Hey, Howie. Good to see you.KURTZ: Let's start with the polling prognosticators. Nate Silver says that Hillary Clinton has an 87 percent chance of winning this election. New York Times upshot blog, a little more pessimistic, Hillary Clinton has 86 percent chance winning this election. Everybody writes off the latest polls. Couldn't these numbers and the coverage become a self-fulfilling prophecy against Donald Trump?REGAN: You know, I've been thinking about that a lot, Howie. That's why we as journalists need to be extraordinarily cautious I think over the next several weeks as we get close to November because keep in mind, anything can happen, right. You think back to Dukakis, 1988, he was actually ahead in the polls in August but wound up nowhere near the oval office. So in other words, the onus is on us as journalists to be cautious about not effectively making this a fait accompli.KURTZ: I couldn't agree more. Now, what about the sheer imbalance in the coverage? I mean, there's absolutely no denying it. You look at any newspaper, website, most cable shows, it's Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. And then Hillary is maybe the fourth or fifth story.REGAN: Well, part of that is because Trump's selling papers, right, or landing ratings on televisions so, the media likes to cover Trump, but I think one thing that I find frustrating in the process is that there's not enough policy coverage. It's all just sort of what did he say lately?And so there's hesitancy on the part of the media to actually dive into the nuts and bolts of what he's talking about versus what Hillary Clinton's talking about. And instead, it becomes very much about the horse race and very much about just what the latest faux pas, right, shall we say on the campaign trail.KURTZ: Or the latest insult or the latest flap, but you set me up for my next question by bringing up policies. So this week, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump both gave major economic speeches. Now, if you're not working for a business network, my sense is they got a half day of coverage, maybe a little bit more, but is there a tendency by particularly political journalists to shy away from the details of tax plans and estate tax and marginal tax rates and carried interest because it's hard to explain particularly on television?REGAN: Yeah, I'll go a step further. I think a lot of them just don't even understand it, Howie, and they chose not to understand it and they deliberately shy away from getting into the nuts and bolts of tax policy because it's just, frankly, too complicated for them and I think that's a very, very sad thing. It is incredibly important that we take on the responsibility of making sure that we understand all of these policies, especially on the economy and then think about it.This is the biggest issue in this election and we need change when it comes to the economic future because our economy is in such a bad state. So, what are the things that Hillary Clinton is proposing? What are the things that Donald Trump is proposing and what will they mean for our economy? And yet no one, frankly, other than us wants to cover that.KURTZ: But if they don't understand it or choose not to understand it, isn't it also perhaps a fear that people who will turn the dial, that economic policy can be dry and abstract and let's go to, you know, the latest Donald Trump said, that Hillary Clinton is the founder of ISIS.REGAN: You're so wrong. I'm going to tell you, they are so absolutely wrong. I mean, I can tell you, I see it every day on the show. Viewers respond to substance. They really do. And it is shortsighted of members of the media to think that viewers won't care about economic policy because, again, this is the thing that everybody cares about.I mean, how are you going to feed your family? How are you going to make sure that your kids have a brighter future than what you have? These are the issues that voters want information on and so, you know, for the media to say, OK, we're not going to cover that because we don't think it's going to rate, they're wrong.KURTZ: Let me jump over the last question, about half a minute. So, what about the argument that some of the journalists are making that, you know, Donald Trump, we've never seen a candidate like him, he's always stepping in it and he's always saying (inaudible) challenge things, therefore we need to give him a lot more scrutiny than we give to Hillary Clinton?REGAN: Yeah, I think they do give him a lot more scrutiny. I don't think it's because he's stepping in it. I think it's because they don't really like him. And that, in fact, is coloring some of their reporting. What I would recommend is, you know, regardless of what you think of either candidate, it is up to us to scrutinize very carefully both of these folks and you can't give anyone a pass just because you may like their policies a little more. And I think that we see that from mainstream media quite a bit, Howie.KURTZ: Or just because one candidate has been around in the political scene for a lot longer. Trish Regan, always great to see you.REGAN: Good to see you too, Howie.KURTZ: Thanks very much.REGAN: You bet.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Ahead, are some media outlets being condescending to the female athletes winning medals in Rio, but first, big changes at the ""Huffington Post"" and in Fox News. Plus, the crazy climber who hijacked cable news.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Arianna Huffington is stepping down from the popular website she helped found 11 years ago to pursue a startup. The Huffington Post now owned by Verizon has become a global force with more than 100 million monthly visitors, and though it regularly fails to turn a profit and gets much of its material by linking to others, it did win a Pulitzer four years ago and is an undeniable success.Huffington, a conservative in the '90s who became an unabashed liberal, originally described the site as a forum for many voices, but Huff Post long ago became consistently left wing. Every story about Donald Trump has an editor's note saying he's a liar, racist, misogynist and worse.And closer to home, Rupert Murdoch who took over as chairman of Fox News after Roger Ailes' resignation, has just announced his new management team. The network will have two co-presidents, one is Bill Shine, a 20-year veteran who had been in charge of all programming for FNC and Fox Business Network. He'll now be overseeing all content at both channels. The other co-president, Jack Abernethy, who is now CEO of Fox Television Stations and will oversee the business side.Now, Since Ailes' negotiated departure on a wake of a sexual harassment lawsuit, there's been plenty of reporting and speculation in the media not just about the Gretchen Carlson suit and other allegation that have surfaced, but about the impact on Fox. The promotion of these two insiders and the deputies' right under them shows that Murdoch wants to bring stability to the place after this major upheaval and that the network isn't changing its direction.Well, cable news got hijacked the other day by a 19-year-old guy from Virginia who climbed up Trump Tower -- and despite the apparent lack of danger, this was considered mesmerizing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHEPARD SMITH, FOX NEWS: This is 56th Street and 5th Avenue in New York City. It's Trump Tower where some guy, we don't know who, is climbing the side of Trump Tower.WOLF BLITZER, CNN: We're watching that situation at the Trump Tower in New York City. Now, this individual climber outside the building has made it up to the 16th floor -- past the 16th floor. Right now, he's still moving up. Police are trying to talk some sense into him.CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS: Breaking news right at this hour out of New York City. A man, look at this, is climbing Trump Tower in Manhattan. He's using suction cups to make his way up the side of the building. Good grief.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Good grief. This went on and on. Steven Regatta (ph) who's been arrested and charged, said he wanted to give Donald the message but he must be a little dim (ph) since was out of state campaigning. But he did send a message that if you push a stupid stunt like this, you can be famous on TV at least until the cops grab you.Coming up, new e-mails reveal a favor-seeking environment involving Hillary Clinton's State Department and the Clinton Foundation. Is that story getting enough media scrutiny? And later, a spectacular defense of newspapers by that noted journalistic champion, John Oliver.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: It has all the elements of a big story. Previously secret e-mails revealing a cozy, favor seeking relationship between Hillary Clinton's State Department and the folks at the Clinton Foundation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)JOHN BERMAN, CNN: Later, Secretary Clinton's allegation of big donors to the Clinton Foundation paying for State Department access and, yes, newly released e-mails.STEVE HAYES, WEEKLY STANDARD: This was a pay for play operation. Basically, people who solicited the Clinton Foundation, they gave money to the Clinton Foundation and got the State Department to weigh in on various disputes and matters.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: But the reporting on this tangled web between the Democratic nominee and her top government aides and allies at her husband's foundation has paled in comparison to the tsunami of Trump coverage. We're back with the panel. Kirsten, are these latest e-mails obtained by Judicial Watch a big story and do they deserve more coverage?POWERS: I think yeah. I do think they're a big story. They have been covered but they could stand to have more coverage and likely, they did not get as much coverage as they should have because Donald Trump was making new news basically every five minutes.KURTZ: If you say every hour, I think you're right.POWERS: Yeah, and so he just, you know, he constantly is giving the media some new outrage and sort of stepping on any bad news that's coming out for the Clinton campaign.KURTZ: So, if Trump had taken a few days off then there might have been more scrutiny of Hillary Clinton?POWERS: I think so. Yeah. I definitely think so and I think it did get some coverage but I think it would have gotten more coverage if they weren't so busy dedicating most of their time to Trump.KURTZ: Lisa, I think you kind of tipped your head on this in the earlier segment, but do you believe the media are intentionally playing down this e-mails or is it just that the story has been simply over shadowed by all of the controversies that swirl around Trump?BOOTHE: All right, I think they're absolutely covering up for Hillary Clinton. You look at ABC, CBS...KURTZ: Covering up is a strong charge.BOOTHE: Well, I stand by it. I think that you look at the coverage of ABC, CBS and NBC, they gave two times more coverage to the Trump Tower climber than they did this new revelations on Hillary Clinton's e-mails. Hillary Clinton is the only presidential candidate to have been in -- have two FBI investigations -- one on her e-mail server and now this new revelation that there is an investigation into public corruption charges with the Clinton Foundation.She has quite literally put our national security at risk, potentially risking lives as well with the information that's based on her server, but somehow this hyperbole and rhetoric gets more attention than action that has put our nation at risk.KURTZ: Would you agree some news outlets, including the big newspapers, cable news networks have covered the story in some substantial detail?BOOTHE: I think to an extent, but not enough. I mean, she's facing two FBI -- two FBI investigations and she's the Democratic nominee. That is mind boggling to me.KURTZ: What jumped out at me, Heidi, is the way that there was a big donor, a foreign guy who wanted to get a meeting with someone at the State Department and suddenly Hillary's top aides are at it. I mean, I think the meeting never ended up taking place, but was the news value here undercutting it all by the fact that there was no incriminating e-mail that was released at least in this round written by Hillary Clinton herself?PRZYBYLA: Well, it's involving her aides but they are her closest aides, right? Huma Abedin...KURTZ: Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills.PRZYBYLA: Right. So, like Kristen says, there's definitely -- this merits a lot of attention, but in these specific e-mails, not only was it not Hillary Clinton writing the e-mails but this is not textbook pay to play and that you can't take it to its logical conclusion that there was some favor given on behalf of this donor. But the question is what more is there to come out? And the media does need to be really vigilant about this because there's more...BOOTHE: She facing another investigation.PRZYBYLA: ...there are more e-mails that may come out as part from WikiLeaks or from the Russian hackers. And so, we have to keep on this narrative just as strong as we are on, you know, the daily kind of like incendiary comments that Trump makes because Lisa's right. It's serious if there is pay to play there, but we have not seen textbook pay to play in these e-mails.BOOTHE: But she's facing another investigation regarding the Clinton Foundation. I mean Donald Trump has not faced two FBI investigations. I mean, this is huge news.PRZYBYLA: I conceded your point but we need...BOOTHE: We need to follow these investigations.KURTZ: She's agreeing with you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But it's still not getting enough coverage.KURTZ: Well, another story that has gotten a lot of chatter this week, and it's been covered more on Fox than any other cable news networks, is about the father of the Orlando mass murderer showing up at a public event for Hillary Clinton, uninvited.The campaign said they didn't know about it, and this generated some coverage and chatter. I'm having trouble understanding why it's a story if he wasn't invited and the campaign didn't know about it, but maybe you can set me straight?POWERS: Well, I think we see it the same way. You know, the idea that Donald Trump has come out and criticized Hillary for this when he has all these supporters who are white supremacists and he doesn't feel any need to disavow them and yet somehow some guy showing up to a Hillary Clinton event, she needs to disavow him, which she actually ended up doing.KURTZ: First, you're not suggesting that many Trump supporters are white supremacists?POWERS: I would say white supremacist websites are frequently posting stuff in favor of Donald Trump. They have attacked -- made anti-Semitic attacks against reporters who have even gotten off on Twitter because they've been so attacked -- he's been asked about that and he still has to refused to criticize them.So the idea that he's going to come out and claim that there's a problem with some guy showing up to a Hillary Clinton's event, which by the way, she did disavow in any way.KURTZ: She did disavow just as Trump disavow when David Duke endorsed him. Can't campaigns be held responsible for any who really wants to offer support?BOOTHE: But the problem here is that the David Duke endorsement got six times the media coverage of the terrorist father endorsing Hillary Clinton and attending her rally because we all know that if he had attended a Donald Trump rally, that would be front page news the next day when all but would completely discredit his campaign so, that's the problem.KURTZ: And I would have a problem with that, too. I mean, if it's not somebody that was invited by the campaign.BOOTHE: And further to that logic, to lump Donald Trump in with these white supremacists, then by the same logic you would have to say well, then why isn't Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton should denounce, you know, people among the Black Lives Matter movement who have said statements like pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon. The reality is there's just not an equal amount of scrutiny applied to.POWERS: There's no evidence that they're Hillary Clinton supporters.BOOTHE: She's endorsing the Black Lives Matter movement.POWERS: No, because that's not -- that's not the same thing.BOOTHE: I think it's the same logic.POWERS: What I'm talking about are people who are attacking people making anti-Semitic attacks against reporters because in one case they're mad at the fact that the reporter wrote an anti-Melania piece allegedly and then he is asked about this and he basically says, ""I don't have anything to say to my fans."" That's not the same thing.KURTZ: I've got just a few seconds left for Heidi.PRZYBYLA: I have actually, in the motorcade, when this went down, in Hillary Clinton's motorcade, and I can tell you proof positive that they were just as shocked as everyone else that he was there because having covered, you know, 16 years of these campaigns, I know that the way these things work is that anybody who wants to wait in line for three hours and go through a metal detector can wind up standing behind the platform. Yes, sometimes they do put their supporters there as well, but literally the campaign was shocked to learn this along...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Got to end it there. We're out of time. Heidi Przybyla, Lisa Boothe, Kirsten Powers, we'll continue this off line. Up next, a debate about the New York Times columnist who's okay with the media tilting against Trump because he's such an unorthodox candidate. And later, The Daily Beast apologizes for a story that outed gay Olympic athletes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Media are tilting against Donald Trump, at least according to New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg who acknowledge that in a piece this week and appear to justify it saying, ""This is the situation facing journalists. If you view a Trump presidency as something that's potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that. You would move closer than you've ever have to being oppositional.""And that's acceptable says Rutenberg, ""It would be an abdication of political journalism's most solemn duty to ferret out what candidates would be like in the most powerful office in the world. It may not always seem fair to Mr. Trump or his supporters.""Joining us now from Charlottesville, Virginia is Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. So, Larry, do you agree with the premise here that there has been a definite media tilt against Donald Trump?LARRY SABATO, CENTER FOR POLITICS UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA DIRECTOR: Yes. I don't think there's any question about that but, look, Howie, there was a media tilt against Mitt Romney. There was a media tilt against John McCain. There was a media tilt against George W. Bush. It has more to do with party and personal characteristics of journalists than anything else.KURTZ: So you believe that the press is generally unfair on presidential candidates, but of course I've never seen anything like this level of vitriol and some of it may be caused by Trump with the statements he makes. So here's the argument, and Jim Rutenberg is a good reporter.The New York Times put this column on the front page, ""Reporters think Trump is dangerous or would be dangerous as president, and it's their patriotic duty to stop him except they're not commentators, they're not activists, they're reporters.""SABATO: Yeah. See, I think that's a very important distinction. If you're a commentator or pundit, you can say whatever you want and the chyron should read ""analysis"" -- that's what you're doing, or analysis on a newspaper headline. But if you're a straight reporter, if you're supposed to just report the facts of what's happening at a particular event, then I think it's more problematic.KURTZ: I ask you about all of this because people don't know that you have a minor degree in press criticism. You once wrote a book called ""Feeding Frenzy."" This Rutenberg column quotes a top political editor at the New York Times, Carolyn Ryan as saying that Trump's candidacy is extraordinary and precedent-shattering and to pretend otherwise is to be disingenuous with readers.Now, I'm not arguing for false equivalency here. Trump says four disputed things and Hillary says one, so be it, that's why we cover it. But when you talk about being close to oppositional, it seems to almost be coming out and saying publicly that some journalists, many journalists, believe that they have to be tougher on Trump because of the nature of his candidacy, your thoughts.SABATO: Well, the political party is the -- the other political party is the opposition to Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton is the oppositional candidate. The press is not the oppositional party and they shouldn't pretend to be the oppositional party. What they will say, and I agree with them in part, this campaign, the Trump campaign has no precedent, Howie.There's nothing in American political history like it. I don't know why he doesn't adopt the theme song from the real chairman of the board, Frank Sinatra ""My Way"" because he's doing everything his way. And it is difficult even to adjust to if you've been covering politics for a while.KURTZ: Yeah, well his way obviously worked in the primaries, but he's having a tougher time in the general election. He has been stepping up the rhetoric against the press. Let me play you something that he said at a rally just the other day.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The media is unbelievably dishonest. I would actually say that the media is almost as crooked as crooked Hillary Clinton.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: So, do you think that these kinds of attacks on the press, which are intensifying, as I say, help Donald Trump?SABATO: Howie, they're counterproductive and you know that. You've got such a long history in the press. First of all, he makes no distinctions between and among members of the press. Reporters are human beings. This will come as a shock to some people, but reporters are human beings, and while they steel themselves to a certain degree against criticism, still, it's a lot when you have a candidate pointing you out in rallies filled with thousands and thousands of activists and saying you're evil, you're crooked, you're bad and then you have individual Trump supporters coming up and screaming and yelling at them while they're trying to do their jobs. That is wrong and he's encouraging it and he needs to stop it in his own interest.KURTZ: Even individual news organizations there are fair reporters or not so fair reporters or commentators. I do agree that those distinctions should be made. Larry Sabato, great to see you this Sunday from Virginia.SABATO: Thank you, Howie.KURTZ: Have a great day. After the break, a woman wins an Olympic medal and her husband gets the credit? That and more on the Rio coverage next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: NBC and other media outlets taking plenty of heat for the way they depict female athletes at the Olympics. NBC chief marketing officer John Miller explaining why the network packages the events, which is sometimes delayed, with soft focused features about those competing said this, ""More women watch the games than men, and for the women, they're less interested in the result and more interested in the journey.It's sort of like the ultimate reality show and miniseries wrapped into one."" Joining us now from New York, Lola Ogunnaike, a host of Arise News and a Today Show contributor. So, what do you think of the argument others have made that women are different. We got to tell them nice stories so they'll watch the Olympics.LOLA OGUNNAIKE, ARISE NEWS HOST: I think it's ridiculous. I think anyone that's tuned in to watch the Olympics doesn't hear the stories but more than anything, they enjoy watching the competition. They enjoy watching superior athletes leave everything on the floor, blood, sweat and tears. That's what they tune in for.They want to see the built in drama that goes into the competition. They're not there for reality show. It's not an episode of the ""Bachelor"" or ""Survivor."" It's the Olympics.  KURTZ: That was a gold medal answer. Let me get you to some specifics here.OGUNNAIKE: Thank you. Thank you, tens (ph) all around.KURTZ: So, when a woman won the trap shooting bronze, the Chicago Sun Times reported this way, ""Corey Cogdell-Unrien, wife of Chicago Bears defensive end, Mitch, wins bronze. In the second paragraph, ""Her husband, Bears defensive end Mitch Unrien cheered her from his home near Chicago. They've been married for two years. What? Your thoughts.OGUNNAIKE: It's really difficult for some people to understand female athlete without the proxy (ph) of the males. So, a female athlete either have to be the wife of, the daughter of, the mother of, she can't simply just be a female athlete. And can you imagine if the same sort of language is used to describe a male athlete? No one ever describes Michael Phelps as son of, husband of, fiance of.He's just Michael Phelps. No one has ever referred to Michael Phelps as the male Katie Ledecky, but Katie Ledecky is always referred to as the female Michael Phelps. Why is that Howie? I don't understand it. It makes no sense. She swims like a man -- she is Katie Ledecky. She's an amazing athlete in her own right and that's it.KURTZ: All right. Here's another example for you. So, Hungarian swimmer -- I hope I don't blow her name -- Katinka Hosszu, she won the gold and NBC's Dan Hicks said that her husband and coach was the guy responsible for her performance. He later said, well, it's impossible to (inaudible) take your story accurately without giving appropriate credit to shame her husband. Kind of making you point.OGUNNAIKE: And that's -- listen. Was he in the pool with her? Did he drag her across the finish line? I don't think so. I mean, he was there to support her. He's there to, you know, be a great champion for his wife and that's about it. I mean, I just don't understand. My favorite though is from the San Jose Mercury about Simone Manuel. The headline read, ""Michael Phelps shares historic night African-American.""KURTZ: That is so nice of Michael Phelps. What a guy.OGUNNAIKE: So gracious of him.KURTZ: I want to mention that the ""Daily Beast"" deleted and apologized for a piece after a reporter used dating apps like Tinder to arrange hook ups with gay Olympic athletes, not only outing them, but in some cases endangering them because in those countries or some of those countries, gay sex is illegal.The ""Beast"" said they screwed up and that's true. Our quick final question for you, former Olympic gymnast medalist, Sean Johnson said, ""Tired of the devastating scrutiny on female athletes, what they wear, how fat or thin they are, whether or not they're pretty."" Does that resonate with you?OGUNNAIKE: I'm sorry, Howie, what was the question?KURTZ: Whether or not -- the focus on whether or not the female athletes are fat or thin or pretty, the appearance question. Is there too much of that?OGUNNAIKE: Listen, we should just focus on their performance, that's it. The women are not there to entertain men. They're not there to titillate the audience. They're there to compete. They are leaving everything -- they're breaking records.KURTZ: Right.OGUNNAIKE: They are creating historic moments. That's solely what they are there for. If you're looking for a beauty contest, tune into a beauty contest. That's it.KURTZ: Got it. Thank you so much Lola Ogunnaike.OGUNNAIKE: Thank you.KURTZ: Still to come, John Oliver and how TV news really, really leans on newspapers. And what really happened when Frank Luntz, on this set, threw a phone.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: It's hardly breaking news that local newspaper are financially struggling as they try to adapt to the online world. HBO's John Oliver has a twisted take on why this matters you even if you get your news from TV or Facebook or Twitter or a bunch of websites.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN OLIVER, HBO LAST WEEK TONIGHT SHOW HOST: Those places (ph) are often just repackaging the world of newspaper and it is not just websites while (inaudible) often TV news ends up citing print sources.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: According to The Chicago Tribune --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: According to the Detroit Free Press --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: According to the San Francisco Chronicle --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: According to The Times --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Boston Globe --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Orlando Sentinel --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Philadelphia Inquirer --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Pittsburgh Tribune Review --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Detroit News --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the Houston Chronicle reports --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Los Angeles Times reports --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Oklahoman reports --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Hartford Courant reports --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Salt Lake Tribune reports --OLIVER: It's pretty obvious, without the newspapers around to cite, TV news would just be Wolf Blitzer endlessly battling a ball of yarn around.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The shrinking business also means fewer reporters checking up on the state houses and city halls and county councils, and it even affects comedians.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OLIVER: Whenever the show is mistakenly called journalism it is a slap in the face to the actual journalist whose work we rely on.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: But John Oliver, I have to say, does a pretty good imitation of a good journalist.Frank Luntz was on the program last week talking about Donald Trump slipping in the latest polls when he got a little carried away.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANK LUNTZ, PUBLIC OPINION GURU: In fact, give me your phone. You got your phone right there. If I were a Trump strategist I would absolutely take the phone and I would throw it away. I would dump it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Now, many of you took to Twitter to ask about the condition of my poor iPhone. But Frank engaged in a little sleight of hand there. Tossing his own phone to the floor, not my mine. He says his phone was damaged and that cut into his tweet (ph). Good thing my little iPhone here was spared from his intemperate moment, it's a good thing I have this as a backup. I know that people think that Blackberry unfashionable but it's good for e- mail.That's it for this edition of ""MediaBuzz."" I'm Howard Kurtz. Thanks for joining us.

9	9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/05/15/grapevine-will-lax-have-move-due-global-warming/	Grapevine: Will LAX have to move due to global warming?	"And now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine...It Was this BigExaggeration happens all the time in politics.This week's example?California Governor Jerry Brown issued a dire warning about the effects of climate change -- a possible four foot rise in sea levels over the next 200 years.Quote -- ""The Los Angeles Airport is going to be underwater. So is the San Francisco airport...You're going to have to move all that...That's billions, if not tens of billions of dollars.""Turns out that warning was kind of a stretch.LAX is more than 100 feet above sea level even at its lowest point.A spokesman for the Democratic governor told the Los Angeles times that Brown misspoke but stands by the larger point about needing to prepare for the impact of climate change.Summer is ComingWell, summer is almost here and the temperature and electric bills are on the rise.One piece of good news, the bill is going to be a little lower following a court decision demanding the Energy Department stop collecting a fee to fund a federal nuclear waste site.Why?No such site exists. One state utility commissioner called the end of the fee -- quote -- ""A victory for customers...People shouldn't be paying for something that doesn't exist.""The fee has been collected for 31 years and has amassed $37 billion.Want a refund? Too bad.The Energy Department plans to use the fund to design and build a new site by 2048.Somber OccasionFinally, today's 9/11 Memorial Museum dedication ceremony almost took an uncomfortable political turn.On the original program after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's speech, a Broadway singer was going to perform the song ""Bridge Over Troubled Water.""The choice seemed to be a not-so-subtle reference to the accusations that Christie's staff intentionally created traffic on a bridge into New York City last year.Just before the ceremony, a museum spokesman announced the singer was ill and ""Amazing Grace"" would be performed instead.The spokesman said the change had nothing to do with Christie or the song."
