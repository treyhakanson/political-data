2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2006/02/23/brutal-politics-academia	 The Brutal Politics of Academia 	"This is a partial transcript of ""Special Report With Brit Hume"" from Feb. 22, 2006, that has been edited for clarity.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL PROFESSOR: This is the hard left flexing their muscles, and sayin g, we don't like the way Larry Summers thinks, we don't like what he says, we don't like what he does. And we're going to get rid of him.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, HOST: So, Alan Dershowitz is behind Larry Summers who is now the departing president of Harvard University. Larry Summers, former treasury secretary under President Clinton. And a man known for a number of things, among them being very bright and sometimes very abrasive and impolitic.He said in his letter of resignation, ""I have reluctantly concluded that the rifts between me and segments of the Arts and Sciences faculty make it infeasible for me to advance the agenda of renewal that I see as crucial to Harvard's future. I believe, therefore, it is best for the university to have a new leadership.""HUME: Larry Summers out at Harvard University after some spectacular conflicts with the likes of Professor Cornell West and others. So what about this? What does this tell us about Harvard, about academic America, about our country?MORT KONDRAKE, ROLL CALL: The good news is that students were against his resignation 3-to-1, so that's...HUME: So much for their say.KONDRACKE: But they're not going along with their lefty arts and scientists faculty. Look, he was in trouble largely for -- in the beginning -- for taking on Cornell West, an African-American professor of African-American studies, on the grounds that Cornell West was writing articles about jazz and not doing serious scholarship. Then he admitted this was error. He wondered whether women had some sort of intrinsic inaptitude about math and science.HUME: He said the question was worth raising -- he said he raised the question.KONDRACKE: Yes, he raised the question.HUME: And one member of the faculty said that she got the vapors, which are -- or someone in the audience said it.KONDRACKE: And it was on and on, with stuff like that. He criticized those who are...HUME: What does this tell us?KONDRACKE: Well, I think it also says -- there were other issues. He defended an economics professor, a friend of his who got involved in a conflict of interest suit that cost Harvard $23 million.HUME: You think that is what this was about that?KONDRACKE: No, I think it was the former. But nonetheless he gave a lot of ammunition to his enemies.MARA LIASSON:, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: That's right. Look, there is nothing more Byzantine than university politics. And I think this was pretty Byzantine. He had the support of the students, a fair amount of the board of trustees, or whatever it is called there, the corporation board. But the faculty, especially in arts and sciences, didn't like his personality and the changes he wanted to bring.The question now is, they have to find somebody new, will that person, assuming he will have a more easygoing personality, will he be able to make some of the same changes that clearly Harvard felt was necessary or they wouldn't have hired Summers in the first place -- which were more kind of left controlled -- Harvard is apparently famously de-centralized. These individual departments and faculties have a lot of control over their own worlds. He wanted to change that. He wanted to bring in new younger blood, and enforce some standards, and make Harvard more vital and vigorous for the future. And we'll see if somebody else can do that.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: He also tried to bring ideological diversity. He vetoed some pretty hard-left professors. He was therefore stepping on autonomy these old lefty arts and sciences professors, who had had autonomy before.Also, he spoke out against those in Harvard who wanted Harvard to pull all of its investments out of Israel. He denounced it and correctly said there was a whiff of anti-Semitism in it. And also defended the military and complained about Harvard being hostile.So, look, all of these other issues are excuses. He said things that are politically incorrect. The hard left rose up and smote him. And as a result I think it will, as you said, who's going to succeed him? It's not going to be another Larry Summers or anybody with any of his political courage or ideas. It's going to be somebody who will be docile and who will accept what is obvious, the power of the hard left in that university and in a large number of other great universities.LIASSON: You know, he's a former Clinton administration official.(CROSS TALK)LIASSON:: What I'm saying is he's certainly no conservative.HUME: He's only a right-winger by Harvard standards.(CROSS TALK)KONDRACKE: There is a kind of parallel to Democratic politicians -- dare support the war in Iraq and you get clobbered by the hard left, as Joe Lieberman would find out every day if he reads the blogs.KRAUTHAMMER: Look, if a center-left treasury secretary, in a center-left government in the United States -- in the Clinton administration -- ends up at Harvard, he's considered a hard-right neo-con. It tells you what lunatic universe these universities exist in, or at least these faculties. And it tells you what kind of atmosphere these people have to live in.HUME: That's it for the panel folks.Watch ""Special Report With Brit Hume"" weeknights at 6 p.m. EST.Content and Programming Copyright 2006 FOX News Network, LLC.

"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:To Tell the TruthCalifornia Republican Congressman Darrell Issa says his effort to get the truth behind Pennsylvania Democrat Joe Sestak's claim that the White House offered him a job to get him to abandon his Senate bid will not end once the primary election is over next month.Sestak is running against incumbent Arlen Specter, whom the administration favors.Issa said: ""I think a felony is something you don't let go of just because an election has occurred."" Issa also says he will soon ask Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the matter.Reality TVIndiana Republican Congressman Dan Burton's latest TV ad includes testimonials from people talking about why they support him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TESTIMONIAL: ""Lots of people say they're conservative, but Dan Burton has been a consistent conservative voice for us.""DAN BURTON: ""I'm Dan Burton, and I approve this message.""(END VIDEO CLIP)But GOP challenger Luke Messer says the testimonials are not from actual Hoosiers, but are paid actors from Columbus, Ohio.Burton's office acknowledges actors were used, but maintains the message is representative of constituent opinion. When asked why the ad didn't use actual Hoosiers, Burton's spokesman said it was a production issue.Show Me the MoneyNew Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie wants the Associated Press to retract its story alleging that nearly twice as many of his staff members are making more than $100,000 than in Democrat Jon Corzine's administration. We brought you that story here in the Grapevine last night. Christie's office says Corzine shuffled staff members around to make it look like fewer people were on his payroll. Corzine's office did not respond to that claim.On HolidayAnd finally, one European Union leader thinks vacation isn't a luxury but a necessity.EU Commissioner Antonio Tajani says traveling is a human right and wants to use taxpayer dollars to help subsidize trips for those who cannot afford it. The plan would see taxpayers footing part of the holiday tab for seniors, young people ages 18 to 25, disabled people, and families facing ""difficult social, financial, or personal"" circumstances.-- Fox News Channel's Lanna Britt contributed to this report."

4	4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/02/23/politics-corporate-tax-plans/	 Politics of corporate tax plans 	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" February 22, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: There's a fair amount of consensus that simplifying the corporate tax code is a good idea, that broadening the base and lowering the rate is a good idea. The president has put forward a proposal that does that. And we hope that conversation continues and that we can produce a result for the American people and for American businesses that will have -- will create the result of a lower tax rate for American businesses, and that will make them more competitive, a broader base to ensure that this reform doesn't add a dime to the deficit.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, here is a look at the Obama plan. It's simple, laid out by the treasury secretary today, reduce the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 35 percent. Manufacturers would be 25 percent. And close loophole. Now, that is a wide range, but part of that is minimum tax on any income earned overseas. Reaction has been quick, critics have been loud. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALEX BRILL, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: This plan has been on the shelf in the Treasury Department for months. That is not a rumor. Secretary Geithner said that himself on the Hill last year. If you have a proposal that you think will strengthen the U.S. economy, you might hold it back for a day or two as you watch the news cycle. But to sit on it for months while the economy continues its anemic growth, while Congress holds hearing after hearing on corporate tax reform, to me that doesn't make any sense at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, it does make sense if you are talking politically ahead of Mitt Romney's release of a plan Friday to the Detroit Economic Club he is talking about it already. His plan would reduce the tax rate to 25 percent. Take a look at the other candidates. Rick Santorum, corporate tax rate to 17.5 percent, zero percent for manufacturers. Newt Gingrich's plan to 12.5 percent, write off all capital investments immediately. And Ron Paul's plan, reduce corporate tax rate to 15 percent, pushing for a flat tax.Let's talk about this, the politics and the policy, and bring in our panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, Liz Marlantes, political reporter for the Christian Science Monitor, and Juan Williams, columnist with The Hill. OK, Juan, what do you think?JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: I think there is a very clear ideological divide evident in terms of the reaction to all the plans that are now floating around. We've got the president's plan and Romney's plan coming Thursday in Michigan. What you see is Republicans saying if this is about simplifying the tax code we're all for it. That is what we want to do. We believe in simplification. But when they look at the Obama plan, what do they say? Oh this actually is going to increase the amount of revenue coming from corporate America into the U.S. government. And in that sense, they say this could be just a veil for increase taxation and they don't want any part of it.BAIER: Liz, a lot of politics in play, obviously.LIZ MARLANTES, CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR: A lot of politics, obviously. I would say in response to that sound bite that you played a minute ago, yes, to some extent it's a cynical exercise to release a corporate tax plan on the same day as your likely Republican opponent. On the other hand, tax reform is not going to happen. Everybody knows that. There is absolutely no chance.BAIER: Up on Capitol Hill.MARLANTES: It is not going to happen. It is just not going to happen. And we saw this with the debt ceiling debate. The fight over taxes is about as entrenched and about as difficult as anything that Congress could try to do. And so it's simply not going to happen. And so the question is it worth still putting some bullet points, as they were called today, some markers that do at least sketch out a vision and say where you think the country should be going? And I think to that extent, that is what the Obama campaign was doing today. And I think their message --BAIER: The Obama White House, even though it was part of the campaign.MARLANTES: I was just going to say, I think they are honing a very clear message. And what they did today, fits in with that message very well. It's all about making the system fairer, getting rid of inequities, getting rid of special breaks for companies that shouldn't be getting them and making people pay the rates that they should be paying.BAIER: On that point, Steve, the National Chamber of Commerce put out a statement saying they are ready and willing to work with the administration but, quote, ""We're disappointed the White House proposal does not adopt a territorial tax system that would put an end to the double taxation of profits earned by U.S. companies overseas...We will be forced to vigorously oppose pay-fors that pit one industry against another or lavish favors on some while punishing others."" This gets to the heart of this minimum tax on any income earned overseas.STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yeah, and I think that is one of the real points of departure between the Romney plan and the Obama plan. If you look at the number of developed countries that tax the way the Obama administration is proposing, it's a very small number. I think the argument the chamber makes and that you've heard other critics make that this would make the United States less competitive overseas is a good argument. It's a compelling argument. You're talking about companies that are gonna want to do everything they can to shelter their money from being taxed and taxed twice because it's already taxed in those areas.Jay Carney, though, I though I think I have to disagree with what he said at the beginning of the segment. This doesn't simplify the corporate tax code. He is right. That is what -- there is a general agreement, broad agreement that simplifying the tax code is desirable. This doesn't do that. This punishes groups that for the present industries that the presidents doesn't like, oil and finance, and it gives benefits to or tax breaks to groups that industries that the president likes, like green energy and manufacturing, or that the president will be able to use in his campaign speeches. And that is exactly what this is.BAIER: So Juan, what about that? Some 40 percent of profits from large firms come from overseas. And 80 percent of the world's purchasing power is outside the U.S. So for the people who say that little provision alone could perhaps slow growth in the U.S.WILLIAMS: No, the idea is that you are focusing on job creation and encouraging manufacturing in the United States. And so it's intended to spur that kind of growth in the United States.And it's very clear that when you look at the overall package, I think that, you know, this notion of overall fairness is not lost on anyone. If you look at the reality, we have a statutory tax rate that I believe is the second highest in the world to the Japanese. But in effect, once you throw in the loopholes, the deduction, goodness gracious, companies like GE are infamous for not paying any taxes. And I'm not only talking about GE, you could talk about Boeing, you could talk about Google. It's unbelievable. And the reality is that once you throw in the deductions and the loopholes, then you come down to the average U.S. companies paying just slightly more than half of what their competitors are paying globally. So that is not the issue.BAIER: In fact, the U.S. had the highest corporate tax rate of any of the 34 industrialized nations. The plan, the proposal would move the U.S. to number 32. Liz, I guess people at home are saying why can't tax reform get done? Why doesn't Washington work so that somehow, some way, it gets done?MARLANTES: It's so hard --BAIER: Simpson-Bowles got it done.MARLANTES: There are a lot of things you can trace to it. I think one of the reasons that the tax issue has become so entrenched actually is the famous Grover Norquist pledge. I really do think that that has played a role on the tax fight on Capitol Hill --(CROSSTALK)MARLANTES: -- which is that many, many Republicans have pledged not to increase taxes under any circumstances, because you used to have -- the last time tax reform happened is under Reagan. And that was in the days when you had Democrats who wanted to raise taxes and Republicans didn't, but they would find ways to meet a little bit in the middle. And you just don't have that anymore. I mean it just is like this barrier that can't be breached.BAIER: But isn't there potentially, Steve, hope that some way, somehow through this election process, somebody takes the football and starts running and gets Congress to follow?HAYES: Well, yeah, one would hope. I mean, I think Republicans, frankly, were late to the tax reform game. I mean, they weren't talking about this in the early stages of the campaign. And remember, it was really Herman Cain's 999 Plan that introduced the subject into the Republican primary. So I think they were late, the proposals were late, and in some cases they haven't been as bold as they could be. But to Liz's point, thank goodness people are listening to Grover Norquist's tax pledge -- or taking Grover Norquist's tax pledge, because if they weren't, taxes, in my view, would be quite a bit higher than they are right now.BAIER: OK, don't miss Rick Santorum joins Greta tonight ""On the Record"" immediately after the debate tonight out in Arizona. Next up, should the U.S. arm Syrian rebels? That's also our text to vote question. We'll be right back.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

5	5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/04/05/politics-behind-presidents-debt-speech/	 Politics Behind President's Debt Speech 	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" April 13, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Before the break, we asked you would you be willing to pay higher taxes in order to help decrease the debt? Only six percent said of you said yes in this poll, 94 percent said no.Now back with panel about the politics of today. There was a lot of back and forth between the two main players.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT: There is nothing serious about a plan that claims to reduce deficit by spending $1 trillion on tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. To meet our fiscal challenge we will need to make reforms, we will all need to make sacrifices. But we do not have to sacrifice the America we believe in. And as long as I'm president we won't.REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: What we heard today was not fiscal leadership from our Commander in chief. What we heard today was a political broadside from our campaigner in chief. I guess it's no coincidence that last week when the president launched his billion dollar re-election campaign was the week we launched our effort to try and get this debt and deficit under control and get our economy growing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Now a number of folks noted one interesting moment in the speech, Vice President Biden was either meditating about the speech, the president's plan, or he may have been a little bit tired. We're not sure there, but we had to show it before we got back to the panel on the politics. John, what about who is winning and losing this political battle here?JOHN FUND, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, I think the Ryan budget has changed terms of debate in Washington. That's why the president was smoked out. He had to come up with something other than the budget that was discredited two months ago.BAIER: Yeah, let's point out he had the State of the Union, and then his budget roll out, both opportunities to do really what he did today.FUND: Right, and now he appears before a bunch of college students and says, oh by the way, here's my plan. It looks a little forced. I think that we are in for a long stalemate, as I said. I don't think either side is going to budge. I think the president is going to go into the 2012 campaign as a class warrior. I think the Republicans are going to go in saying we're not going to budge on taxes whatsoever for any income bracket. And that's the terms of the debate that are going to play out.The president, by the way, is sticking with Obamacare and he's going to say that's going to restrain healthcare costs. Increasingly, as Obamacare kicks in, I think that is becoming less and less likely.BAIER: A.B.?A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: Well, there were actually three opportunities for the president to come to the table. In December, he ignored the recommendations of his own debt commission and then in January at the State of the Union he did it again. And then with his budget in February he [INAUDIBLE] again. So this is now the undoing of his February budget and it's a new plan.That said, there is something that has to break the stalemate, and that's the increase on the debt ceiling and that has to come in the next two months. And so we can sit around and talk about Republicans opposing the sun setting of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. That's two years from now. I mean that's -- in May of 2011, he can't push that through the vote in the Congress.What we're talking about now is what are the concessions that the Democrats are going to give Republicans to join in on an increase on the debt ceiling and avert the unthinkable? A government shutdown was possible. This is not possible. And the Republican leadership knows it and the people who fund their campaigns are freaking out on them behind the scenes. So that is actually a deadline that's coming. And as of tonight, there is no beginnings of consensus of how they'll get them.FUND: I think Harry Reid has a plan to get the debt limit through the Senate. If no senator objects you don't need 60 votes to pass the debt limit. You can do it with a simple majority. And that means --BAIER: Yes, but you mean to tell me that the DeMints or the Coburns or somebody is not going to object?FUND: Well, then the onus [INAUDIBLE] falls on the Republicans. And that's probably what Harry Reid wants.BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: Look, I don't know how many times he gets a swing at the ball before people recognize that he's not serious about the debt. As A.B. pointed out, he had his commission, he ignored it, he had the State of the Union, which is astonishing. He didn't use the word debt until he was more than halfway through that speech. And then, of course, in the budget which does nothing except explode the debt.The fact is, as A.B. mentioned, that his people called up the Gang of Six on Sunday and said hurry up with the plan, and the plan doesn't even exist, tells you how fictional is Obama's so-called plan.BAIER: But are Democrats happy with this?KRAUTHAMMER: He wants to incorporate a plan that actually doesn't even exist.BAIER: Are Democrats happy with this today? Are they --KRAUTHAMMER: I think this speech was a speech to his base, no one else. And what he was saying is, I'm really smart. Let me show you that I'm with you on this, opposing any real cuts but I'm smart enough that I'll pretend that I'm a cutter and I'm a deficit reducer and I will work across the aisle as I did in 2008. I can get away with it. I'm clever. I'll show you how I can do it. I'll do it in half of this speech and I'll run all the way until Election Day next year, demagoguing Ryan and pretending I'm a centrist.BAIER: That --FUND: I was here it for Bill Clinton; when Bill Clinton pulled that. Bill Clinton was much better than Barack Obama at that game.BAIER: That is it for the panel. But stay tuned as one of our own gets an extreme makeover.Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2011 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
