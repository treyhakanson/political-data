This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 25, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""An Obamacare disaster unfolding right in front of our eyes and it could hurt democrats across the country with just two weeks to go before Election Day. When the president sold his signature health care law, he promised Americans their premiums would go down.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: They are suddenly going to see opportunities not just for the rebates we discussed but also for even greater savings than their monthly premiums, that if you don't have health insurance, you finally are in a position to get something at an affordable price. They said that these rates would come in real high and everybody's premiums would be sky high. The prices came in lower than we expected, lower than I predicted. The growth of health care costs is down and that's good for our middle class and that's good for our fiscal future. Health care prices have risen at the lowest rates in 50 years.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: But now the White House admits the Affordable Care Act isn't going to be so affordable after all. Obamacare premiums are set to drastically spike next year by an average of 25 percent. So if you live in Arizona, they might increase by a hundred and sixteen percent. Other battleground states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina could see hikes, an average of 53 and 40 percent. So premiums are skyrocketing, as many critics predicted, but don't blame the president, says the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: A lot of times, they just report premium increases and everybody thinks, wow, my insurance rates are going up. It must be Obama's fault.(LAUGHTER)OBAMA: Even though you don't get health insurance through Obamacare, you get it through your job. Even though your increases have gone up a lot slower, you know. Or for suddenly you're paying bigger copay (ph) and, ah, thanks, Obama!(LAUGHTER)OBAMA: Honestly -- well, no. I had nothing to do with that.(END VIDEO CLIP)ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Oops.PERINO: All right. Eric, can you take us through the numbers, because?BOLLING: Wait a minute. Isn't, isn't it called Obamacare? What do you mean you had nothing to do with that? And isn't that exactly everything that we've been warning about for the better part of four or five years? How long it's been since we started this process? Dana, you pointed out Arizona, a hundred and sixteen percent, North Carolina -- how about Minnesota? You mentioned Minnesota yesterday, another battleground state where (inaudible).PERINO: Yeah. And there's only one insurer, right?BOLLING: Yeah. The insurers have moved out, 59 percent increase there, Pennsylvania, 53 percent. Utah, dead tied, 20 percent increases there. Forget that for a minute. In that same speech that Obama talked about Obamacare failures in advance of what we found out yesterday, he compares Obamacare to the Galaxy Note, you know the one that starts on fire and they have to pull off the market.PERINO: You're not allowed to have it on a plane anymore.BOLLING: Oh yeah, yeah. He said something like, ""Oh, you know, you don't go back from Smartphones because one of them starts on fire."" No. You do. You start over. You pull it off the market while people are getting burned or dying if one blows up on the airplane.PERINO: You figure out the engineering problem.BOLLING: And you figure out a way -- and by the way, because there's a Smartphone, the reason why there's a competition of Smartphones called the iPhone, so what Donald Trump should do, even Hillary Clinton at this point should do is say, here's how we will fix the health care system in America.PERINO: And that is going to be on the minds of a lot of people because it's not just the premiums that have gone up, Greg, it's also deductible are really high and also you have, especially here in Manhattan, the number of doctors who says we're are not taking any of the insurances, so the insurances is living in the island.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah. But you know what the fix is going to be? More poison.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: There'll be more poison.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Obamacare was destined to fail, according to the left, because it wasn't pure enough. And that's the philosophy behind all socialism in the last hundred some odd years. It's never the idea. It's the implementation and it would only work better if you were more subservient to government and that you're forced to actually join. It's a lesson in socialism. As long as your heart is in the right place, your hands can go anywhere. Just ask Bill Clinton. And it proves (inaudible) point that sooner or later you run out of wealthy people and the people that get hurt in this, in this massive program of redistribution -- because that's what it is. The reason why the premiums are going up because more people are paying it, so other people don't. It's a redistribution, it's a socialist scream and you sure later run out of the rich and you ended up hurting the middle class.PERINO: Good thing is Kimberly, is that.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah.PERINO: . a lot of people having had -- people who didn't have insurance before and then got insurance under Obamacare, they kind of like it. So now you're in a situation where you have fewer people that are able to pay, but the democrat solution is subsidies, subsidies come from where?GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: Taxpayers.GUILFOYLE: Subsidies comes from the taxpayers. And again, you're continuing to use the same source of power and revenue stream over and over again and eventually it taps out. So yes, you may be doing some good for some people, but what is the overall structure of it and is it built to last? No. Because it cannot survive the way they had it presently designed. I mean it does just little basically do itself in, in a matter of time. And we're actually seeing that happen very quickly. It was predicted, but now you're seeing the fallout in, you know, rapid succession and obviously they didn't put enough time and thought and energy into it because they were just trying to rush it, get it out to market. Well, we worry about a few lawsuits, a few deaths along the way after it happens, but it was their whole ideology that they were more interested in putting forward than actually quality, affordable health care.PERINO: Juan, I bet you would disagree, right?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I do to some extent. I mean, where I agree is that I think there's a problem and I think you've heard that not only from Donald Trump but from Hillary Clinton and from Bill Clinton, famously who said this thing is going crazy, and from President Obama. Everybody says there needs to be steps to fix the system. You know it was out of whack for six decades, 60 years. People are trying to fix it. Obamacare was an effort to do that. And so now you've got a situation where you've got premiums going up and fewer insures in the marketplace. But I think a key thing here is what President Obama just said. And we all heard he said, ""You know what this doesn't affect most Americans who get their health insurance through their employer plans and premiums there are going down."" And 77 percent, Dana, of the people who are currently enrolled in Obamacare or Affordable Care Act -- guess what, they can still get a plan for under a hundred dollars a month, 83 percent of them get subsidies. So even in that marketplace, what you're seeing is, gee, most of these people will do pretty well. The problem is people who make just too much money or outside of that marketplace, some of the small business owners that we've heard discussed. But again, to take it away, it comes back to what we were talking about earlier. Somebody would have to say, here is a better idea. Here's something that will work because if you take it away right now, you will start to affect a larger market people who realize insurance companies can't deny coverage right now under Obamacare, children are able to stay on until they are 26 on a .GUTFELD: Can I ask --WILLIAMS: . planGUTFELD: But --WILLIAMS: You can't have a lifetime cap.GUTFELD: But to your point like, you know, what do you replace it with, this is the two-fold disaster of Obamacare. It's not just Obamacare. It -- the real damage is what you could have had instead. Every social program has another consequence, an invisible consequence. What private alternative could there have been that we no longer pursue because we chose the government answer, and the government answer, it's always inferior to the private answer. And to Kimberly's point about why it was rushed, is because the media was for it. The media refused to connect the dots between socialism and poverty. So this was another program.PERINO: They made fun of anybody.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: And also, there were deals that were done in the back rooms. Remember those deals?GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: And that was when he -- when President Obama came in. He had the, he had the democrats -- he had the captive audience. He got it done. He pushed it through. One of the reasons why Obamacare is failing right now, it is something we warned about here for years that young people would take the fine instead of buying Obamacare. Obamacare is too expensive. So they say, you know what, I'm not going to buy Obamacare. I'm not going to support the system that is paying for a lot of the elderly who are sucking all --GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: All the assets out of the system. Someone has got to put it in. and they were expecting young people to pay up. And we said this not what's going to happen.PERINO: Let's get --BOLLING: It's really cheaper to take the fine.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Let's get Donald Trump. He spoke about this earlier. I think Hillary didn't issue a paper statement, but we have Donald Trump on camera. So we are television, we shall show it to you.GUILFOYLE: We are television.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Obamacare is just blowing up and even the White House, our president announced 25 or 26 percent. That number is so wrong. That is such a phoning number. You're talking about 60, 70, 80 percent increases. Obamacare has to be repealed and replaced and it has to be replaced for something much less expensive. All of my employees are having a tremendous problem with Obamacare. You folks, this is another group. Is that a correct statement? I mean you look at what they are going through, what they are going through with the health care is horrible because of Obamacare.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right. So Kimberly, it's like a political gift two weeks before the election, Obamacare, and yet Trump got it wrong there because his employees actually get health coverage through him, through his company, through the benefits, not from Obamacare. But still, he's going to try to make a go of it.GUILFOYLE: Right. I mean, so he -- right, wrong group but correct sentiment which is, y'all out there not just right here in front of me, out there. So yeah, this is -- I would take this all the way and run. It's like an interception and run it back in for the score .PERINO: Yup.GUILFOYLE: . you know? Right as the buzzer goes off. It's true. And this just shows it's the whole thing where, listen, they knew that this wasn't going to work. I mean the architect talked about it and in laughing about pulling it over on the American people, and it's --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: In such a thing that is so important which is health care, for those that really need it, the elderly people who are facing more medical crises in their life, you want to trust him and rely on them to not try to, you know, perpetuate or fraud on you. Instead they did with gleeful delight and now it's caught up to them even quicker than they thought.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: They would love to (inaudible) after the election, but unfortunately it's coming before November 8th.WILLIAMS: Well, give them credit, they didn't delay it. I mean they announced it. But I will say this, when I look at the politics of it Dana, I see that --GUILFOYLE: Thank you for killing me now instead of two weeks.WILLIAMS: I'm sorry?GUILFOYLE: The ideas. Thank you for killing me now instead of in two weeks.WILLIAMS: I'm not killing anybody. But I'm saying, they put out what is bad news for them right now --PERINO: I don't think they had a choice because the insurance companies were --WILLIAMS: The insurance companies -- we knew that part. They also put out that they expect more people now to enroll because they can have a higher income and still qualify because of the --PERINO: With more subsidies, because that was --WILLIAMS: Right.PERINO: But that was Greg was saying --WILLIAMS: But in terms of the .PERINO: There'll be more poison.WILLIAMS: . politics of it, which interests me greatly, you know, could this be a game changer going two weeks into the election. I looked at the Gallup and it's not even an issue that Americans caring about much it and when you go --PERINO: But in the House and Senate races .BOLLING: You're bad?PERINO: . republicans are making a deal about it.WILLIAMS: They're making a deal.BOLLING: And they should.WILLIAMS: But the numbers are .BOLLING: And they should.WILLIAMS: . when people are asked, what do you care about in terms of noneconomic issues?BOLLING: You know --PERINO: I know.WILLIAMS: And it's just not there.BOLLING: You know what people care about Juan? They care about their premiums. Now we have premiums going up, but their deductibles skyrocketing .GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: . which is another after effect and that they failed to mention prior that we talked about here. And Middle America right now is getting squeezed. They can't afford health care, they can't afford Obamacare, they are told -- they can't work 40 hours a week or they are going to call full- time and they're going to have to be put on the health care system. I'd pushback aggressively on your assessment that America doesn't care about Obamacare.WILLIAMS: Oh my assessment is Gallup.PERINO: Things there.WILLIAMS: I mean that's -- I think everybody in the table say, that's what the poll number show.GUILFOYLE: It is part of the --WILLIAMS: But wait.GUILFOYLE: The poll they said they don't trust .WILLIAMS: When you look at --GUILFOYLE: . Washington.WILLIAMS: When you look at --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: What democrats say 74 percent of democrats support this law, 76 percent of republicans oppose the law. Independents are split. And when it comes to --BOLLING: If you take this Gallup poll after were find out that premiums are skyrocketing .GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: . a hundred percent?WILLIAMS: They take it every month, so this is --BOLLING: Before, right? Let's find out within next month.GUILFOYLE: Wait for the next one.BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: OK.PERINO: Last word?GUTFELD: Gallup is just horsing around.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Much more to come on ""The Five"" -- I just got it. The latest on the presidential race ahead, but first, an update on our flight -- fight, excuse me, to drive out ISIS from Iraq. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: In case you missed it, we're at war.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DEFENSE SECRETARY ASH CARTER: I certainly am encouraged by the results of our campaign so far in that -- it has been proceeding as planned and we have already achieved very significant results both in reducing the flow of foreign fighters and removing ISIL leaders from the battlefield... I'm confident that we will deliver ISIL the lasting defeat that it deserves.(END VIDEO CLIP)Now, if there's any group deserving our destructive wrath, it's ISIS. They're Nazis without the fine tailoring.But the challenge isn't their fearlessness, it's the collateral damage. What we are seeing are heathens taking advantage of our own goodness: using human shields, knowing our humanity prevents us from wanting to harm them. It's their lack of morality taking advantage of our wealth of the same.So what do we do?Sadly, the math. Human shields provide ISIS opportunities to continue fighting another day. So does backing away now, pave the way for a worse, existential horror later?Their goal is martyrdom: the more dead, the merrier the afterlife. It's a sick belief that sooner or later takes all of us with them. For when primitives replace pointed sticks with dirty bombs, their path to heaven can soak the Earth with blood. A plane plus a box cutter flown into a building becomes quaint; compared to the acquired nuke in a major city.So imagine that hellish decision made before dropping the bomb in Hiroshima. To prevent more death involving hundreds of thousands or even millions, do you inflict a smaller, but substantial horror now?No one wants these decisions. But do we have a choice? There's no room for pacifism in the era of jihad. For while it's true no one wants a holy war, what if the holy war wants you?BOLLING: What's that, what's that you nuke them? Nuke them?GUTFELD: No. No, I wouldn't -- I don't think it's practical to nuke a desert.BOLLING: OK.GUTFELD: But i think what it's talking about is weighing the choices -- the unfortunate choices that are not pretty, which are, you know, when -- and it's also happened in other parts of the country -- of the world where they use human shields. What do you do when you're faced with that? If you do nothing, then they live to do something perhaps worse.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: No. Listen. They are generous at saying collateral damage is part of war. If you're going to win the war, you have to accept the collateral damage. I'm not sure where we are in it.GUTFELD: Yeah. What about you, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: I think it's about the map, probably. You know, you calculate risks, you take them, and then you have make very tough decisions that have significant, moral and ethical, you know consequences. So you have to have very good intelligence coming in, in real time from the ground to tell you what is going in that specific theater to say, OK, this is who they have, this is true commitment to know whether or not they are using schools and hospitals to take cover because they do want collateral damage .GUTFELD: They do.GUILFOYLE: . to make what you are doing to them very unpopular. So it's part of the whole media and aspect of warfare and then you have the cyber aspect of it. So, you know, it's a complicated piece. But most importantly and significant, they've got them on the ropes now so you have to finish them off.GUTFELD: Exactly. Juan, you know the problem here is you can't fight a war halfway. Do you sometimes wonder what it would have been like if we had the same sensibilities that we do in 2016 if it were World War II, World War I, would we go, what we would have done what we did?WILLIAMS: In terms of Hiroshima?GUTFELD: Whether -- yeah. Or bombing threats (inaudible), some say it's necessary or not, but the fact that --WILLIAMS: Well, O'Reilly's book, in fact, he said he got several presidents to say they would have done the same thing, including Jimmy Carter. So I mean -- but I -- what's strikes me --GUTFELD: But he didn't ask Obama, did he?WILLIAMS: He did, but Obama wouldn't answer.GUTFELD: Didn't answer. Yeah.WILLIAMS: Wouldn't answer -- and Clinton wouldn't answer and O'Reilly think is because Mrs. Clinton is running for president. But I wanted to pick on something Kimberly said. I thought it was insightful which is that I think this is a media war. A lot of it is about media. So if you make the decision, that you know what, we're just going to wipe you, we're going to crush you. You go back to like the Vietnam scenarios when they were using guerrilla warfare and then we used the napalm -- guess what, you the picture of a little girl .GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: . running naked down the street, that's all over --GUILFOYLE: You get the Aleppo.WILLIAMS: Hey, you know, United States -- (inaudible). You know, we have ISIS, given that they are already a media phenomenon, right, because that's how they recruit people and they go in and they take advantage of poor people who are lacking in opportunity. This is -- you can't feed them propaganda. You've got to think a step ahead of their game.GUTFELD: Dana, do you think that is -- what's happening right now is kind of forgotten in this other fog of the campaign, that we aren't really paying attention?GUILFOYLE: Fog of election.PERINO: I definitely think so because also the candidates aren't talking about it.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: You know Obama hardly speaks about it. Ash Carter, the defense secretary, you know, he's gone over there but he's certainly not leading any newscast. And Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, both haven't said anything. I think the other part is that we can definitely win the military battle. We can win that. It's the question of what we are willing to do to keep the peace. And you still have to work out with the various actors, you have the Kurds, and the Shia, you got to make sure that they are not going -- the Shia don't have any revenge tactics against the Sunni.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: You have to figure out that diplomatic piece. The other thing that you have to do is figure out a way to stop the ISIS, whoever has not been killed, like it's killed like 700 ISIS soldiers, but those who have left, if they melt back into the shadows .GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: . they can (inaudible). So it's not just .(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . a military war, but it's an ideological one. And not one of our choosing, but as you were saying in your monologue, it's one that we have to fight.BOLLING: There's one other method that we -- I don't know. I don't know if people are employing. First of all, you have -- they have two sources of income. Number one is the oil fields and they are clearly using that and they're selling and bringing it back into Turkey and other western countries even, and selling the oil. So you have to cut off their supply of money through that. If you're caught dealing with ISIS in any way you have perform, you're done. You're finished. We're going to shut you down. And the (inaudible).(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: The other asset is -- the other income revenue producing thing that they do is they charge people to live.GUTFELD: Right.BOLLING: Like the mob does.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: If you want to stay safe, you gonna pay us. Let them do that, but corner them. Get them into their Raqqah and their areas and corner them. Don't let them out. And then, eventually they will fold. They don't have enough money to survive --PERINO: Like in the wire.GUILFOYLE: But the problem is .(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: . they've been preparing for this day. They knew a day of reckoning was coming. So don't underestimate them. They're putting out of a rosy picture, but they are prepared to take as many losses and casualties as possible. So they've got sleeper cells, they have suicide bombers. They are going to try and disrupt this path of victory and defeat for them --BOLLING: To your point .WILLIAMS: One last thing --BOLLING: Your point -- your point -- we stopped. We didn't bomb some oil trucks that are going back into Turkey because we were afraid they were civilians .GUTFELD: Right.BOLLING: . driving the truck.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: Are you kidding me? If you're driving a truck for ISIS or you're going to drive the truck that you're gonna sell oil -- ISIS oil to someone else, you should die.WILLIAMS: One last thing.GUTFELD: Unless you gonna put --PERINO: Unless you're being made to.GUTFELD: . gallons are made to.WILLIAMS: Yes, made to.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: But one last thing .GUTFELD: It's our choice.WILLIAMS: I think we have heard from one candidate .GUILFOYLE: Run quicker.WILLIAMS: . on this effort, which is Donald Trump. And he says it's a disaster what we're doing over there and that our troops are losing. I don't know why he would say this.GUTFELD: Yeah. All right, on that note we got to move on -- but good point Juan. Our soldiers are putting their lives on the line for our country. How does the Pentagon reward them when they come home, by asking for their signing bonuses back? That's outrage next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: It's a story that making my blood boils and should anger all Americans. I told you briefly about this yesterday, our brave soldiers have been valuably fighting the war on terror. So how does our government thank them for their service, by demanding they return their re-enlistment bonuses? It's outrageous and it's not acceptable. And a decade ago, the California National Guard was short on troops to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, so enticed, thousands of soldiers to re-enlist with sign up bonuses of $15,000 or more. Brave men and women signed on the dotted line and they fulfilled their duty. But now the Pentagon says their bonuses were improperly paid and has been demanding the money back with interest. Many of those soldiers are now struggling to find the cash to pay it back. Defense Secretary Ash Carter commented on the controversy today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ASH CARTER, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Anybody who volunteers to serve in the armed forces of the United States deserves our gratitude and respect. Period. We got is complexities to it and we are going to look into it and resolve it. It's a significant issue.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: A significant issue. You asked them to serve, you asked them to put their bodies, their blood, their families could potentially suffer tremendous loss if they don't come home and now we say pay me back with interest.GUTFELD: You know on cable news, we deal with so much outrage, you know banning Christmas, you know arrest the eater bunny, no 10 commandments (inaudible), that -- this is actually one of those rare occasions where the outrage is palpably real. I mean this is like -- it's so unbelievable that you think it's not actually real.PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: But it reveals that the blinds -- the blind eye of bureaucracy. If your job is to shuffle papers from pile A to pile B, it's predicated ongoing really smooth, but the bumps in that transition are called humans. So you stop thinking about humans, you just see them as paper work. And if you see that you're over budget or it doesn't make sense, you just want to move, (inaudible), you get the refunds and you forget that these are human beings. That's the problem. And the evil with bureaucracy with big government and why, you know, decentralization is important.GUILFOYLE: And Bolling, you would think that they would know, that this would be something hugely unpopular to do and just -- you wouldn't even have to like flip a coin to figure out what was the right call on this. Well, tough call. So anybody got a quarter on them? No.GUTFELD: Yup.GUILFOYLE: Bad idea.GUTFELD: Exactly.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: So, trying to get money back from the IRS after 10 years or seven or 10 years and they will tell you statute of limitation has run out on that. Sorry about that.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: We're not going to give you your money back with interest.The number's not small. I mean, do the math on the numbers, somewhere probably north of 50 to $60 million that they paid out. I get that. It's a large sum of money.But when you think of -- I don't know -- Hillary Clinton's State Department still looking for $6 billion that they can't find, or we gave Iran $1.7 billion in unmarked bills...GUILFOYLE: The state sponsors of terrorism.BOLLING: Sponsor of terror. So when you look at it in terms of that, this is a drop in the bucket. It's an error. You made a mistake, Pentagon. Let these people keep the money. And if you don't let them keep it, certainly work out a payment plan where they are not paying interest and they can pay this thing off over the next 30 years.GUILFOYLE: Yes, but they're also, like, garnishing their wages, as well. They're literally, forcefully taking the money back. And this should be -- there should be litigation with this if they can't come to their senses in time.PERINO: In your ""One More Thing"" yesterday, the woman who was describing what their family is going through, I mean, they are in -- they are distressed, and it's terrible.I will make a plea to organizations around the country, including the Pentagon, include the press people in these meetings. I guarantee that the press people had no idea that this was going on and it was going to get to this point, or they would have figured out a way to stop it.Just like with a major airline a few years ago. They started charging, unbeknownst to the communications department, marketing guys, they started a new policy of charging extra for bags that were coming back from our...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: ... with our soldiers from Afghanistan. And all of a sudden, it becomes a 48-hour story, terrible for the company. The communications people are saying, ""Are you out of your mind? We can't do that."" And they fix that by the end of the day.One of the answers that the Pentagon says is, ""Well, there is a website you can go to to apply for"" -- like no. Wipe this off the books. It actually can be done.GUILFOYLE: And before they start to take it forcefully, a taking by the government of money they gave you out of your paycheck so when you go to cash or to get your direct deposit, ""Sorry little Johnny, no more school for you."" I mean, this is ridiculous.GUTFELD: When they repossessed the cars -- what bank was it -- while servicemen were abroad, I mean, they were serving, they repossessed their cars. Again, to your point, somebody could have seen...BOLLING: Private companies, though. And they have the ability to say, ""No, we're going to excuse that,"" because it's a private company. With the government, I'll bet you -- I bet you they drop a $50 million check...GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: ... 40 times a year.GUILFOYLE: Give some more money to Solyndra.BOLLING: ""Oops, where did that go?""WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I think everybody at this table is opposed to fraud and mismanagement. And there was widespread fraud and mismanagement of this program, which was supposed to go to people going to high-stress situations. And what you have is fraud, not by the soldiers who are being punished. They often didn't know about it.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: It was by the people in the California National Guard who had a shortage of sign-ups. So they're below their quota, and they're trying to pump them up. They start giving out this money, and it was fraudulent. So who do you hold responsible?Now, as it was recently pointed out, the government saying, ""Hey, you know what? Go to this website. Come talk to us."" They've settled this for about 4,000 of the 9,000 people involved. Five thousand remain. And it's the question of whether or not you're going to punish these people.But I would also say it's going to have an impact on future enlistment when people get bonuses and incentives, because they're going to say, ""Hmm, is this going to be real?""GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: ""Is this going to be me paying back in five years?"" So that's not a good move.PERINO: They should automate it with robots and take away the humans.GUTFELD: That's nice. Steal more jobs away from human beings, Dana.GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, I know two human beings who can do something about this: California Governor Jerry Brown and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. We'll wait to hear from you.Stay tuned. Eric quarterbacks the jam-packed ""Fastest Seven,"" next.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who's cold?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: It's time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: Fastest 7(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: ... ""The Fastest Seven Minutes on Television."" Three stimulating stories, seven spirited minutes, one suasive host.First up, President Obama is on short time, just days until he is truly a lame duck president. He spent some free time with Jimmy Kimmel last night. ""Mean Tweets"" are always funny and never lame. Check it out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ""Barack Obama dances like how his jeans look."" You know, this jeans thing, this is so old. This is years ago. Come on.""My mom bought new conditioner and it sucks. It isn't even conditioning my hair. I blame Obama.""""President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States,"" exclamation point. @realDonaldTrump. Well, @realDonaldTrump, at least I will go down as a president.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: I'll bring it around this way. He's got great timing.GUTFELD: Yes, he's also got senioritis. Remember that?PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: You just do nothing but hang out.GUILFOYLE: Yes. That's his freshman year.GUTFELD: I've had it since I was 5.But you know, it is funny, but Twitter isn't funny anymore. I mean, for the average person who's not the president or a celebrity, it is the world's most pernicious bathroom wall. And I swear to God, at some point I'm getting off the bathroom wall because it is just no fun anymore. Too many angry, angry people.WILLIAMS: You say that every day.GUTFELD: I say it every day, and I'm a hypocrite. I know.GUILFOYLE: You can't stop saying it.GUTFELD: I know.GUILFOYLE: ... a segment out of you.PERINO: I think that -- I think that what President Obama showed is one of the reasons why he has these 51 percent approval ratings that are almost unheard of for a second-term president. Part of that is not that Obamacare is doing great. It's not that the war in the Middle East is going great. It's that people like him, and he's funny.BOLLING: Juan, I dislike almost all of his policies, but I think he's brilliant on ""Jimmy Kimmel."" I think he's brilliant in ""Between Two Ferns. The man's got great timing.WILLIAMS: Yes, great timing. I like the -- we didn't play the joke about someone asked, does he even lift?PERINO: Oh, yes.GUILFOYLE: Obama, bro, do you even lift?WILLIAMS: He said, ""I get credit because I lifted the ban on Cuban cigars."" I thought that was pretty funny.BOLLING: K.G.GUILFOYLE: Yes. He's super funny, and every year he kills it at the White House Press Correspondents' Dinner. He's good. He's good at that.GUTFELD: I'm going to throw up.BOLLING: He'll have plenty of time.GUILFOYLE: He can do that full time now.BOLLING: A couple of weeks.I don't take many days off. I like to work, and frankly, it's probably one of the reasons why Adrienne and I have spent 19 years together, because if I stayed home, I'd probably drive her crazy.Here's a political ad that hits home like that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GERALD DAUGHERTY: We've got room to put 2,700 people in our jail, and it costs us about $103 a day.CHERILYN DAUGHERTY: Gerald really doesn't have any hobbies.G. DAUGHERTY: Last year's tax rate was 1.469. This year we can take that down to .3838.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So is he always like that?C. DAUGHERTY: Yes, all the time. All he wants to do is fix things.G. DAUGHERTY: So we get this 18-wheeler that's parked in this neighborhood, fumes all over the place. But quite frankly, it's not a code violation.You know, I think I like helping around the house here.C. DAUGHERTY: Please re-elect Gerald. Please.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: K.G.GUILFOYLE: That's funny. I feel her pain. Yes, I mean, God bless her. She's staying with him, but you know, let him go be a fixer and fix everybody else's problems. It's cute. It's very clever.BOLLING: Pretty good ad, Juan.WILLIAMS: Terrific ad. You know, it's the kind of ad you say, ""That's human."" It's so funny, and you know it's so real. I think what do the Japanese say, ""Retired men are like wet leaves, hard to sweep out.""PERINO: It reminds me of this guy that sold us a vehicle in South Carolina last year. He had lived in Boston his whole life. He and his wife raised his family there, and he worked in finance. And then they moved to Hilton Head. That's where they're going to live. He's so excited to be retired. And after three weeks she said, ""You have to get a job."" So then he went to work at the car dealership.BOLLING: Gregory.GUTFELD: Great story, Dana. Do you have another one like that?PERINO: Sure.GUILFOYLE: Do you have all day?GUTFELD: For the next block?PERINO: Can I tell you about my dog?GUTFELD: Yes.You know what's -- you know what's great about this? Is that it's better produced and better acted than most commercials that you see. They had natural instincts about what they were doing. It was better than anything you see on ""SNL"" or ""Scandal."" Sorry, Kimberly. But they were more -- they were likeable because that's who they were. I just thought it was -- for a local ad, it was way superior than the national crappy stuff.GUILFOYLE: It was so good.BOLLING: Good stuff.How about this one? I can't believe it, my whole childhood was spent hoping the Cubs would be good this year. Excited how good they were this year. And then, oh well, there's always next year. Well, after 108 ""next years,"" the Cubs, my Cubbies are headed to the big show.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The baseball gods are probably really happy right now.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don't have to dream anymore. It's a reality. Four more wins and whoopee.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You want to wear the same underwear; you don't want to change your underwear out. I mean, you wash it. But...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want them to win one before I die.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: She was 100. In excess of 100 years old.Listen, to Hemmer, Mr. Ohio. Do we have action? Stellas versus Blue Moons, loser buys. Game one from Cleveland tonight, 8 p.m. on FOX broadcast, with Joe Buck on play-by-play. John Smoltz is the analyst. And field reporter Ken Rosenthal. Juanito.GUILFOYLE: Hemmer only drinks Stella on tap. So you better go do your research.BOLLING: Stella if he wins, I'll buy him Stellas. If I win, I get the Blue Moon.GUTFELD: Don't get Stella on tap. You get gas. Everybody knows.GUILFOYLE: Tell him.BOLLING: Tell Hemmer.GUTFELD: Yes, because they don't clean the -- they don't clean the tubes. And the -- so sometimes it's a little bad.GUILFOYLE: Did that happen to you over at Lanes (ph)?GUTFELD: Many. That's why I only drink the bottle.WILLIAMS: Wow.GUILFOYLE: See about his issues, his stomach issues?WILLIAMS: Holy smoke.GUTFELD: Everybody knows.BOLLING: So you have either Hemmer -- Hemmer's stomach, still on tap or the Cubs, or Indians.WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I'm just a huge fan of Joe Madden, who's the manager of the Cubs. I think he's a terrific manager. So when my kid got married this summer in Chicago, I was down in the hotel lobby, and who comes over? Joe Madden.But on the other hand, Terry Francona, who manages the Indians, has won two. Madden hasn't won any World Series.GUILFOYLE: Like a coach.WILLIAMS: I just have to think to myself that somebody is due here.BOLLING: Dana, you're great at picking the winners. 1948 the last time the Indians won the World Series. 1908, the Cubs.PERINO: Well, OK, so here's the thing. Can you give me a day to think about it? I need to watch the game tonight. I need to see how they're performing, and I'll tell you tomorrow.WILLIAMS: You're going to watch?PERINO: I'll probably watch a little bit tonight. Sure.WILLIAMS: OK.PERINO: Not really.BOLLING: Go Cubs?GUILFOYLE: Go Cubs.BOLLING: Go Cubbies!There you go. I'll leave is right there.Highlights from the trail today from both nominees, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: In case you just got home and haven't had a chance to follow what the presidential nominees have been up to all day, well, here's some of what went down on the trail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Americans are coming together. At the very moment when Donald Trump is making an unprecedented attack on our democracy. Then I hope you will come out and vote, because it's going to be a close election.TRUMP: In 14 days, we're going to win the state of Florida. We're going to win back the White House.Do you see the pictures? They're wearing the red hat, the white hat, this hat. They're wearing all -- they're wearing buttons all over the place. I think those are people that are inclined to vote for us. Do you agree?(END VIDEO CLIPS)WILLIAMS: Gregory, one thing that stands out, they are both in Florida.GUTFELD: Yes. It's great. It's a great time to be there. Can this be over? Can we just fast forward for two weeks? I'm tired of it.GUILFOYLE: Don't fast forward our show.GUTFELD: No, no, no. We'll DVR it while you fast forward it. Yes. But I just want it to end. I want it to be over. I want to move on with dot- org. My life.WILLIAMS: Dana, do you see a way...GUILFOYLE: You want a divorce from the election?GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: ... you know, everybody was saying, is there a path forward for Trump? And I was amazed. I was reading that Republicans are upset that he's sending people to Virginia where they don't think he can do much.PERINO: Well, and the other thing is, is that Pence, the vice-presidential candidate, was sent to Utah today.WILLIAMS: What does that mean.PERINO: Well, because Utah is one that they need to win. Like, it is actually -- they're struggling right now. There's a tie.WILLIAMS: Because of the third-party candidate.PERINO: Because of the third-party candidate, Evan McMullin.WILLIAMS: So he can't go to other states that have more electoral votes, because he's stuck in Utah.PERINO: Exactly.WILLIAMS: Eric, what do you think?BOLLING: Here's what I think. So they spent the day in Florida, both candidates. Florida and Ohio are absolutely must-wins for Trump.I put up a piece on FOXNews.com today about calling out the other 2016 GOP candidates that ran for president, because they love the country. Well, if you love the country and you're conservative, you know Hillary Clinton is not the conservative for the country. So I would love to see the other 16 -- two weeks left, get behind the candidate, love him or hate him; care about the country, care about the party, get it done.WILLIAMS: Kimberly, Mrs. Clinton said it's going to be close. What do you think?GUILFOYLE: I think she's smart to be worried and concerned. Anything can happen, absolutely. You know, they can't think that the chips are in and that they've got it and they ran the table, because I don't think that's going to be the case. And they should try campaigning very hard in any of the states that they need to win and take absolutely nothing for granted, because not only does she want to try and win, not only does Trump want to try and win, they want to win decisively so that there is some sort of mandate to be able to go in.Because they're already going to be facing the fact that both of them have very high unfavorables. So whoever is the next president of the United States is already going to be at an offset and a little bit of a disadvantage.PERINO: And a different message for her, because yesterday we were talking about how cocky they sounded. They talking about just, like, moving past the election and working on the transition. And her saying that it's going to be close and in a state like Florida, I don't know whether they have internal numbers that show them that they should be worried or more to Kimberly's point, that they want to make sure the turnout's...GUTFELD: Juan, I might -- Juan, I might have breaking news on a scoop that is going to probably drop in the next couple of days.WILLIAMS: OK.GUTFELD: Hillary was impregnated by Hitler's ghost and gave birth to the bat boy in a cave in the lost city of Atlantis.WILLIAMS: Were you up at 10 p.m. watching ""Hannity""?GUTFELD: No comment.WILLIAMS: All right. ""One More Thing,"" up next.GUILFOYLE: Oh, boy.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing"" -- Juan.WILLIAMS: Cub fans have been waiting forever to see their team in the World Series. And 97-year-old World War II veteran Jim Schlegel, he's a passionate fan. He saw the Cubs play in their last World Series, 1945 when he'd just come home from the war. So he wanted to go to this year's game, but he didn't have a ticket.PERINO: Aww.WILLIAMS: So his granddaughter started a GoFundMe page to raise $10,000 to get her grandpa a ticket. And the fund reached its goal within a day. Oh, happy day!But it looks like he doesn't need the money, because CNBC host Marc Lemonis is giving Schlegel two front-row seats...GUTFELD: Wow.WILLIAMS: ... for Friday's game at Wrigley Field. Schlegel will be going with his son. He predicts the Cubs will win in seven games or less. And by the way -- isn't this wonderful? -- the extra money will go to the Purple Heart Foundation.GUILFOYLE: Very nice.GUTFELD: Nice.BOLLING: That's great.PERINO: Wow, that was excellent ""One More Thing.""GUILFOYLE: Very cool.PERINO: Eric, can you top that?BOLLING: Probably not. But I can try to do...GUTFELD: The writing is so good on this.BOLLING: I know. This is Kyle. Kyle is making these. So I'm having dinner with my friend, Frank, last night, and he said you should talk about the debt -- the country's debt versus a family. Check this out.Look what you find out. Here's what the federal revenues are: $3.2 trillion. We spend $3.8 trillion. We're adding $620 billion of debt. That means, 100 -- I'm sorry, $19 trillion to the already national debt. And we're trying to cut back by $38 billion.If you erase eight zeros from this and apply it to your family, that would be like your family making 32 grand a year, spending $38,200 a year, putting $6,000 of new credit card debt onto an already outstanding debt of $192,000 and saying, ""Hey, kids, we're going to cut back your allowance. Here's 380 bucks for the year."" Now you see how -- what's going on here?PERINO: That's good.BOLLING: Now you see why we need change in D.C.?WILLIAMS: What were you guys drinking?BOLLING: It was vodka.PERINO: I like this. Any questions?BOLLING: Any questions?PERINO: This is like a new thing. Any questions?All right. That's interesting. Good way to explain it.GUILFOYLE: That was, like, more intense than Ronan's math homework.PERINO: Bear with me while I tell you about this Jasper book one more time. Because today was the actual launch day. It's actually now in stores. And I had a chance, as many people around this table have, to go on ""The View"" this morning. Here's a clip from that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And this year has been very difficult. I mean, in some ways, well, it literally brought me to my knees at one point, because it has been so vitriolic, and America's better than that in so many ways. So, dogs are a great equalizer.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: They're really great, and the book is fun. It's, like, not political at all. So I think we have a little thing -- do we have anything? Well, there's a little video. See, I love -- this is a video, a little slide show of the Photoshops that are in there that are done by FiveFanPhotoshop. Many of you know him here.OK, Greg, you've got something very sweet.GUTFELD: Well, it's time for this. Please roll it, will you?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Unicorn News.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Now, if you're a regular watcher of this fine program, you know that I have a mug. It's here right here, but what is different about this mug? His little horn is back. How did that happen? It's been broken for some time, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: You glued it?GUTFELD: No, I didn't glue it. A young woman, 12-year-old girl, I might add, Taylor Fortis (ph), sent me this with a nice note, basically saying that she's been watching the show and it doesn't look like a unicorn. It looks like a horse. So she went and got me a new unicorn mug and said if I mention it, she's going to be crying, because finally, a famous person noticed me.That is true. I am famous.PERINO: What's that say back there? It says, ""P.S.S, tell Dana Perino, sorry, Dana, I spelled your name wrong, but I love her dog, Jasper. Adorable."" I love you, too, Taylor.GUTFELD: Taylor, we're not friends anymore.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. So mean.BOLLING: Take that back.GUILFOYLE: He's kidding.BOLLING: Kidding. They're best friends.GUTFELD: I'm joking.GUILFOYLE: Naturally, like, mean, cranky person, but he means it in a nice way.PERINO: OK, Kimberly, you've got the one to bring it home.GUILFOYLE: This is a very good ""One More Thing."" OK?So yesterday more than a dozen Palm Springs police officers escorted 8- year-old Vanessa Vega's to school on her first day back following her father's death earlier this month. You remember that her father, Officer Jose Gilbert Vega, and his partner, Officer Lesley Zerebny, were shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence disturbance call on October 8. The suspect was later arrested.These officers wanted Vanessa to know that they will always support her and be there for her. She is 8 years old, and she is the youngest of Vega's eight children. He was just set to retire, I think, in November, December. An incredible story and a show of support for the men and women in blue.PERINO: Did you see also the story today that support and approval and popularity of police has gone up, like...BOLLING: A record high.PERINO: ... 24 percent or something.BOLLING: By Democrats, as well. The Republicans have always been high...GUILFOYLE: Good.BOLLING: ... but the Democrats have turned it around, too.GUILFOYLE: Expect the women and men in blue to put it on the line for all of us every day and keep me safe from Greg.PERINO: And others. All right.Set your DVR so you never miss an episode of ""The Five."" That is it for us.
