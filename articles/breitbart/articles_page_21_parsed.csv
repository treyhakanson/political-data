""It's so close. It's certainly do-able [for him], even when you look at the polls.""Read the rest of the story here.BREITBART LIVE"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

With so much at stake in this election, and so much controversy already surrounding Abedin, America can't afford a mystery.The facts about Abedin need to be told in a clear-headed and factual way, including the facts about Abedin's ties to Saudi Arabia, and its largest charity, the Muslim World League, an acknowledged funder of terrorism.As Maureen Callahan laid out the basic facts about Huma Abedin in a New York Post article titled, ""Despite countless scandals, Huma Abedin remains a mystery"":With the FBI looking into Clinton emails contained on a laptop shared by Abedin and estranged husband Anthony Weiner -- himself now the subject of an FBI investigation for sexting with a 15-year-old girl and sending a crotch shot with his toddler son sleeping next to him -- Abedin has gone from loyalist to liability...Not much is known about Abedin's life before Clinton Inc. She was born in 1976 in Kalamazoo, Mich., to an Indian father, Syed, and a Pakistani mother, Saleha. Both were academics and devout Muslims. When Huma was 2, the family moved to Saudi Arabia, but almost nothing is known of Huma's childhood and teen years. She returned to the United States to attend George Washington University, majoring in journalism with a minor in political science.Her father co-founded the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, and after his death in 1993, her mother, whose writings subscribe to Sharia law, took over as editor-in-chief, a post she holds to this day. The journal has published articles in favor of female genital mutilation, the sexual subjugation of women and murder of apostates.Newsweek reported in an April article, ""Meet Huma Abedin, Mysterious Clinton Aide Whose Emails Might Change History,"" that a Clinton insider described Huma as ""very, very religious person--she didn't smoke, drink or swear, always very polite."" This made her marriage to Anthony Weiner especially bizarre:For a practicing Muslim, Abedin's choice in husbands couldn't have been more provocative. In 2010, she married Anthony Weiner, then an ambitious, hyperactive U.S. representative from Brooklyn. He is Jewish, which would prompt many conservative Middle Eastern Muslim families to disown their daughters, or worse. Bill Clinton officiated at their designer-dressed, pricey and pastoral New York wedding.We all know how that marriage worked out. The initial Weinergate sexting story was broken after Andrew Breitbart exposed the truth about the many women with whom Weiner had online relationships. Those online affairs began just about a month after Weiner and Abedin's wedding.Huma Abedin exercises an astounding amount of control over Hillary Clinton, even limiting her access to husband Bill Clinton. As Newsweek reported in April:Insiders understand that if they want anything from Clinton, they need to hit Abedin's direct number first. Says New York financier and Clinton supporter Alan Patricof, ""I don't even waste time trying to find Clinton directly. I only would go to Huma. It's like talking to Clinton."" On the campaign trail, Abedin still travels everywhere with the candidate. She does some bag-schlepping, but her job has evolved: She carries her own purse (she has a collection of designer ""it"" bags), but tucked inside it is Clinton's cellphone. Even aspiring first husband Bill has reportedly complained that he cannot get past Abedin.That same Newsweek piece hinted at the reason Huma Abedin remains a mystery woman: Journalists and people around her are forbidden to discuss Huma's most controversial part of her biography--her connections to Saudi Arabia and the Muslim World League. According to Newsweek, ""in Clinton circles, it's the height of uncouth to mention Abedin's nationality or childhood,"" and so, few mainstream media journalists have even asked.The New York Post lays out the basics on Huma Abedin and points out the holes in her resume:The story Vanity Fair reported earlier this year filled in a couple of more details. It sketched out the fact that the Abedin family was brought to Saudi Arabia by an official in the Kingdom who headed up a group called the Muslim World League. His name was Abdullah Omar Naseef.When (Huma) Abedin was two years old, the family moved to Jidda, Saudi Arabia, where, with the backing of Abdullah Omar Nasseef, then the president of King Abdulaziz University, her father founded the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs, a think tank, and became the first editor of its Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, which stated its mission as ""shedding light"" on minority Muslim communities around the world in the hope of ""securing the legitimate rights of these communities""... In his early years as the patron of the Abedin's' journal, Nasseef was the secretary-general of the Muslim World League, which Andrew McCarthy (...) claims ""has long been the Muslim Brotherhood's principal vehicle for the international propagation of Islamic supremacist ideology.""The connection between the Abedin family and the Muslin World League is the most ominous connection that Huma Abedin has, but it's often overlooked or ignored altogether. For example, neither the current New York Post story or April's Newsweek article make any mention of the Muslim World League at all.Huma Abedin and her entire family's sponsorship by the Muslim World League is, however, the most troubling aspect of her biography because of the Muslim World League's status as a terror funding group.The connections between the the Muslim World League's support for terrorism go back to 1980s, when Abedin family benefactor Omar Naseef was the general secretary of the Muslim World League.In 1984, foreign mujahidin fighters were streaming in from all over the world to an office in Peshawar, Pakistan--the office of the Muslim League--to the Maktab al-Khidamat (MAK) or ""The Services Center""--to fight in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union.MAK had been created to recruit and raise money by three Muslims who believed in ""the defense of Muslim lands"": Abdullah Azzam, Azzam's protege, a Saudi Arabian named Osama bin Laden and an Egyptian called Ayman al-Zawahiri.Donations to MAK came from a number of ""Islamic charities"" such as the Saudi Red Crescent, as well as a number of Saudi Arabian princes and mosques. MAK also worked with the Pakistan intelligence service, the ISI. The ISI was used by both the American CIA & Saudi Arabia Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah intelligence agencies to get money to Afghan fighters.When the war against the Soviets ended, Al-Zawahiri and bin Laden would use the money they'd raised through MAK to declare global jihad on the West and al-Qaeda was born.Just after the 9/11 attack, reports showed that intelligence officials believed for years that Naseef's Muslim World League was connected to terror, but failed to inform the public of the connections due to pressure from Saudi Arabia.As Newsweek reported less than a month after the 9/11 attack (emphasis added):The Saudis have probably done more to penetrate Al Qaeda than any other foreign intelligence service, but Al Qaeda in turn has penetrated the Saudi regime. Two interrelated global charities directly financed by the Saudi government--the International Islamic Relief Organization and the Muslim World League--have been used by bin Laden to finance his operations. The organizations were left off the list of groups sanctioned by the United States last week, U.S. officials hinted to NEWSWEEK, in order to avoid embarrassing the Saudi government.This inaction against Naseef's Muslim World League was confirmed in a 2004 story by Harpers:In other cases, the Bush Administration made a conscious decision not to pursue major Saudi conduits for terrorist funding. The clearest example involves two ostensible charities that are long known to have funneled money to Al Qaeda--the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) and the Muslim World League (MWL). Both are financed directly by the Saudi government. MWL is an evangelical organization that was created to help spread Wahhabism, the Saudi brand of Islamic fundamentalism; IIRO is a humanitarian relief organization that operates primarily in Muslim countries.Harper's also noted that during the Clinton administration the Central Intelligence Agency issued a report about Naseef's Muslim World League and the International Islamic Relief Organization.Consider the timing: in the fall of 1996, Huma Abedin began working in the White House. According to Harpers:Yet a 1996 CIA report alleged that IIRO helped to fund six militant training camps in Afghanistan, and noted that the former head of the group's Philippines office--Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law--had been linked to plots to ""target the pope and U.S. airlines""...U.S. intelligence officials also believe that MWL employees were involved in the 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa. Although both IIRO and MWL were known to have funded Al Qaeda, U.S. government sources indicated to Newsweek in October 2001 that the Bush Administration left the two organizations off the list of designated terrorist groups in order to spare the Saudi government from embarrassment.So how did Huma Abedin end up at the White House in the first place? To understand that, you need to understand how Saudi Arabia in the 1990s was spreading influence with both the Clinton administration and laying the groundwork to influence the Bush administration and Republican establishment.The man behind that influence is now serving time in Federal prison for his role in funding terrorism. His name is Abdulrahman Alamoudi.Abdulrahman Alamoudi was sentenced to 23 years in prison in 2004 for his role in an assassination plot but was once described by the Washington Post as ""one of America's best-known Muslim activists,"" who during the Clinton administration, ""also helped found the Pentagon's Muslim chaplain program and was involved in a variety of other Islamic political and charitable organizations.""In March 1996, Alamoudi said he was ""honored to be a member of the committee that is defending"" Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP) founder Musa Abu Marzook. As the Israeli business website Globes reported on Marzook in 2014:""One of those fundraisers was Dr. Musa Abu Marzook, the number 2 man in Hamas,"" Elad says. ""At the beginning of the 1990s, he began a fundraising campaign in the US among wealthy Muslims, while at the same time founding several banking enterprises. He himself became a conglomerate of 10 financial enterprises giving loans and making financial investments. He's an amazing financier.""The U.S. administration ordered Marzook's arrest in 1995 on charges of supporting terrorism. After he spent two years in a US prison, it was decided to expel him without trial. He kept the money. ""When he was expelled from the US in 1997, he was already worth several million dollars,"" Elad says, adding, ""Somehow he evaded the clutches of the US Internal Revenue Service and was not charged with financing terrorism. People in the know say he probably became connected to the administration and cooperated with it. There is no proof, but it's hard to think of any other reason why he escaped punishment for such serious offenses. In 2001, in the investigation of the September 11 events, it turned out that he had extensive financial connections with Al Qaeda, including the transfer of funds to the 21 Al Qaeda operatives accused of the attacks.""Today, Marzook is considered one of Hamas's wealthiest billionaires. ""Arab sources estimate his wealth at $2-3 billion,"" Elad says.In late 1996--the same year that Hillary Clinton hosted his group for the Ramadan at the White Hosue--AMC founder Alamoudi spoke to a conference for the Islamic Association for Palestine held in Chicago.At that event, Alamoudi said eventually America ""will become a Muslim country.""Alamoudi was emphatic that he was working to create political change in America while leaving open the possibility of violence elsewhere. He told his audience ""you can be violent anywhere else but in America."" His speech was recorded and he said:It will happen, it will happen (unclear word) Allah, I have no doubt in my mind, Muslims sooner or later will be the moral leadership of America. It depends on me and you, either we do it now or we do it after a hundred years, but this country will become a Muslim country. And I (think) if we are outside this country we can say 'oh, Allah destroy America', but once we are here, our mission in this country is to change it. And the prophet told us that there are three ways of changing things, either by your hand or your mouth or within yourself, and we can change it by our hand and by our mouth, but positively. There is nowhere for Muslims to be violent in America, no where at all. We have other means to do it. You can be violent anywhere else but in America.In 2000, Alamoudi would openly declared himself as a supporter of terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah at an anti-Israel rally.Alamoudi was the President of Muslim Students Association in the 1980s and both Huma Abedin and her father were members.The Muslim Students Association was formed in 1963 by the Muslim World League. As the New York Times described the group's origins, it was heavily influenced by Saudi Arabia:Organized in the 1960s by foreign students who wanted collective prayers where there were no mosques, the associations were basically little slices of Saudi Arabia. Women were banned. Only Muslim men who prayed, fasted and avoided alcohol and dating were welcomed. Meetings, even idle conversations, were in Arabic.Donations from Saudi Arabia largely financed the group, and its leaders pushed the kingdom's puritan, Wahhabi strain of Islam. Prof. Hamid Algar of the University of California, Berkeley, said that in the 1960s and 1970s, chapters advocated theological and political positions derived from radical Islamist organizations and would brook no criticism of Saudi Arabia.In was during this period in the early 1970s that Huma Abedin's father Syed was connected to the MSA at Western Michigan University.A search of the WMU website shows papers published by Abedin in 1972 and credited to ""Abedin, Syed Z | Kalamazoo, Mich. : Muslim Students Association, Western Michigan University 1972.""Given Syed Abedin's involvement during the ""slices of Saudi Arabia"" early years of the Muslim Students Association, it's not shocking that in 1979, Syed Abedin was picked to run the Institute of Muslim Minority in Saudi Arabia. According the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs inaugural issue in 1979, Naseef was the Institute's Chairman.Huma Abedin would spend the next 16 years growing up in Saudi Arabia. When Huma Abedin was sent to the United States for college, she become part of the MSA. A page from the group's 1996 website at Archive.org lists her on the Executive Board as the Head of Social Committee.It's not surprising that Huma Abedin was part of the Muslim Students Association but it should raise eyebrows and it's a valid subject for questions since the MSA has been breeding ground for known terrorists. As the Canary Mission website summarizes:Anwar al-Awlaki was president of the MSA at Colorado State University during the mid-1990s. An al-Qaeda cleric linked to numerous terror plots including 9/11 and the Fort Hood shootings, al-Awlaki was the first United States citizen to be targeted and killed in a United States drone strike. After his death, he was linked to the terrorists responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre, to whom al-Awlaki had repeatedly preached, calling for the killing of newspapers editor, Stephane Charbonnier. Omar Shafik Hammami was president of MSA's chapter at the University of South Alabama during the early 2000's. In 2006, Hammami abandoned his young wife and child and left for Somalia where he became a militant leader in the terrorist organization al-Shabaab. Ramy Zamzam was a past president of the MSA's Washington, D.C. council, before his conviction in in 2010 for attempting to lead a group dubbed the ""D.C. 5"" to join the Taliban in Pakistan.Alamoudi also helped put together the first dinner at the White House celebrating the end of the Ramadan fast known as Eid; an event hosted by Hillary Clinton and advised by Huma Abedin.That 1996 event was put together by Alamoudi's assistant director, Khaled Saffouri. In 1998, Saffouri explained to the Los Angeles Times how the that first White House Eid dinner developed:The White House celebration of the Eid comes after years of efforts to educate the public about Islam and a specific effort to encourage recognition of Ramadan, said Khaled Saffouri of the American Muslim Council, a Washington-based educational organization.After Saffouri organized an observance in the U.S. Senate in 1996 and personally invited the first lady, her aides asked him to organize a similar event at the White House.On February 20, 1996 then-First Lady Hillary Clinton hosted the first dinner at the White House celebrating the Muslim holiday of Ramadan. In her remarks that night, she admitted:Like many Americans, I have only recently gained a full appreciation of Islam. When I was growing up, there were no courses in Islamic history or religion in my schools and the Koran was not on too many bookshelves in American households. Fortunately, that has changed, as I know from my own family experience.I have to admit that a good deal of what my husband and I have learned has come from my daughter, who some of you who are our friends know took a course last year in Islamic history. When she and I traveled to South Asia, she provided me with a running commentary on everything we saw and visited.Mrs. Clinton's ""full appreciation of Islam"" would come after a number of impossible-to-miss historic events involving Islamists that had shaped the United States. Most Americans in the modern era first became aware of the Islamist threat during the Iranian hostage crisis that began in the Carter administration.More significantly, two major events involving Islam happened during the early years of the Clinton administration itself, both with long-term consequences: the Bosnian war and the first attack on the World Trade Center.Understanding the threat of Islamist ideology should have been a prerequisite for leadership in the face of those events, but three years into the Clinton administration--after both the Bosnian War and the first attack on the World Trade Center--Hillary Clinton admitted that both she and the leader of the free world had learned ""a good deal"" of what they knew about Islam from 14-year-old high school sophomore Chelsea Clinton.Bosnia has become an important point of recruitment for terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State group, which is based out of Iraq and Syria. Nearly 40 percent of the nation is Muslim, and Bosnian national Husein Bosnic has become a top recruiter for the group in Europe, helping send more than 300 foreign fighters to Syria, according to a report in France 24.Although Saffouri and Alamoudi would have an impact in the Clinton White House, they also wanted to have influence with Republicans.One immediate impact was that Ramadan dinners became a White House tradition that extended through George W. Bush's administration and have been carried on by Barack Obama.In 1997, Saffouri--the man who put together the first White House Ramadan dinner event for the Clintons--would cofound the Islamic Free Market Institute with GOP political operative Grover Norquist and Morquist's brother-in-law, Palestinian activist Majed Tomeh. Norquist was an important influncer on the Republican Party through this anti-tax group lobbying group Americans for Tax Reform and remains so today. Norquist is also the board of the National Rifle Association.Norquist's Islamic Free Market Institute, also known as the Islamic Institute, would be funded in part by a $20,000 check from Alamoudi. Another $20,000 came from a man named Jamal Barzinji.The funding of the Islamic Institute by Barzinji and Alamoudi is well documented was admitted by Norquist in an interview with Glenn Beck in March 2015, where Norquist claimed that Alamoudi's radicalism was not known at the time:""He worked with the Pentagon for crying out loud,"" Norquist said. ""He traveled evidently for USAID or the State Department... He is somebody who was, at that point, people thought or said he was an OK guy.""Republican Norquist co-founded a group called the Islamic Institute, funded by two $20,000 checks; one from former Muslim Students Association National President Abdurahman Alamoudi and another from one of the 1963 founders of the Muslim Students Association, Jamal Barzinji.By the end of 1990s, there would be two powerful, unelected influencers on Islamic issues working behind the scenes at the Presidential level: Huma Abedin working with the Democrats and Grover Norquist working with the Republicans.It is also worth noting that when questions about Huma Abedin were raised in 2012, that one of the people who sprang to her defense was Grover Norquist.As Politico reported at the time in an article titled, ""Norquist: Bachmann claim 'indefensible'"":""It's completely indefensible, there's nothing else to say,"" Norquist said in an interview with POLITICO.Norquist joked that the one thing he and Anthony Weiner had in common was that they ""both married beautiful women.""Norquist is married a Palestinian woman who met through the Islamic Institute. Norquist's sister Loraine is also married to a Palestinian activist, Majed Tomeh, who co-founded the Islamic Institute with Norquist.However she ended up in the White House, it's clear from a search of records from the Clinton White House that Abedin quickly became a go-to resource on Islam for the future Secretary of State.At the 1999 Ramadan dinner, Hillary said:There are many people who have made today happen, but special thanks are due to Maureen Shea, Mona Mohib and Huma Abedin for putting together this event.Maureen Shea was associate director of the office of Public Liaison at the White House.Hillary Clinton goes on to to cite one example of Huma Abedin's influence.I must say that I have seen very personally the impact of Ramadan because of having Huma on my staff, and have had many occasions to talk with her about the particular meaning of Ramadan.Later in that 1999 speech, Hillary Clinton would go on to say how she believed that the ""values that are embodied in Islam"" including the yearning ""to live in peace"" ""strengthen the United States"":Today, we celebrate Eid with special foods and exchanging of gifts, and by honoring the remarkable contributions of Islam that have enabled millions and millions of Muslims around the world to endure and thrive through the ages and enrich us all..We also honor the universal values that are embodied in Islam--love of family and community; mutual respect; the power of education; and the deepest yearning of all: to live in peace. Values that can bring people of every faith and culture together, strengthen us as people, and ,I would argue, strengthen the United States as a nation.Other documents from the Clinton era show how quickly Huma Abedin went from being a White House intern to becoming an important consultant on all things Islamic, including presidential speeches.According to an email sent by Maureen Shea in 1999, Huma Abedin was one of White House's ""resident Muslims"" and gave notes on a speech by President Bill Clinton.Among the notes are pronunciation suggestions on the word ""Muslim"" as well as a note to take out a reference to Iraq as ""too political.""The Shea Memo read in part:Subject: Comments on Video01/11/99 09:33:24 AMHope this is helpful - I have consulted with Huma and Mona, our two resident Muslims!First of all, can you get the President to pronounce Muslims not as Moslims but as Musslims!Paragraph one:would be great.Paragraph two :* end with ""and by the fasting which is one of its five pillars.""Paragraph three: too political: Keep first line and take out the rest - the part on Iraq is especially out of place in a religious message.The line that the ""resident Muslims"" wanted removed was ""I especially hope we will see the lives of the Iraqi people improve. They have suffered from a harsh dictatorship for too long.""That was considered too political.By 1999, internal White House memos would show that the ""generic"" Clinton take on Islam would be that ""we have no issue with Islam, issue is those who distort religion, or nationalism, or ethnic feelings to suit their political interests.""This, of course, would be the standard line from the Clinton administration to the George W. Bush administration to the Obama administration; despite the rise of al-Qaeda and then ISIS, despite attacks on the World Trade Center, London and Paris and despite the sharp spike in worldwide terrorism since the Arab Spring, the messaging from Washington is always ""we have no issue with Islam.""A few days after terrorists toppled the World Trade Center in 2001, George W. Bush would stand in a mosque in an event arranged by Grover Norquist and Khaled Saffouri, the man who had organized the first Eid dinner at the Clinton White House. Bush would tell the world: ""Islam is peace.""Eleven years later, Hillary Clinton would be Secretary of State with Huma Abedin at her side. After terrorists from Ansar al-Sharia killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, President Obama would tell the United Nations that ""the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.""And now, Americas get to decide whether the future belongs to Huma Abedin.Follow Breitbart News investigative reporter and Citizen Journalism School founder Lee Stranahan on Twitter at @Stranahan.With the FBI looking into Clinton emails contained on a laptop shared by Abedin and estranged husband Anthony Weiner -- himself now the subject of an FBI investigation for sexting with a 15-year-old girl and sending a crotch shot with his toddler son sleeping next to him -- Abedin has gone from loyalist to liability...Not much is known about Abedin's life before Clinton Inc.

Ramy Zamzam was a past president of the MSA's Washington, D.C. council, before his conviction in in 2010 for attempting to lead a group dubbed the ""D.C. 5"" to join the Taliban in Pakistan.The White House celebration of the Eid comes after years of efforts to educate the public about Islam and a specific effort to encourage recognition of Ramadan, said Khaled Saffouri of the American Muslim Council, a Washington-based educational organization.
After Saffouri organized an observance in the U.S. Senate in 1996 and personally invited the first lady, her aides asked him to organize a similar event at the White House.Like many Americans, I have only recently gained a full appreciation of Islam. When I was growing up, there were no courses in Islamic history or religion in my schools and the Koran was not on too many bookshelves in American households. Fortunately, that has changed, as I know from my own family experience.
I have to admit that a good deal of what my husband and I have learned has come from my daughter, who some of you who are our friends know took a course last year in Islamic history. When she and I traveled to South Asia, she provided me with a running commentary on everything we saw and visited.""He worked with the Pentagon for crying out loud,"" Norquist said. ""He traveled evidently for USAID or the State Department... He is somebody who was, at that point, people thought or said he was an OK guy.""""It's completely indefensible, there's nothing else to say,"" Norquist said in an interview with POLITICO.
Norquist joked that the one thing he and Anthony Weiner had in common was that they ""both married beautiful women.""There are many people who have made today happen, but special thanks are due to Maureen Shea, Mona Mohib and Huma Abedin for putting together this event.I must say that I have seen very personally the impact of Ramadan because of having Huma on my staff, and have had many occasions to talk with her about the particular meaning of Ramadan.Today, we celebrate Eid with special foods and exchanging of gifts, and by honoring the remarkable contributions of Islam that have enabled millions and millions of Muslims around the world to endure and thrive through the ages and enrich us all..
We also honor the universal values that are embodied in Islam--love of family and community; mutual respect; the power of education; and the deepest yearning of all: to live in peace. Values that can bring people of every faith and culture together, strengthen us as people, and ,I would argue, strengthen the United States as a nation.Subject: Comments on Video

Hope this is helpful - I have consulted with Huma and Mona, our two resident Muslims!
First of all, can you get the President to pronounce Muslims not as Moslims but as Musslims!
Paragraph one:

As not all Arabs are Muslims, take out Arab and simply say; ""On behalf of all Americans, Hillary and I would like to send our best wishes to Muslims both here and around the world as
If he could say ""Eid Mubarak !EED-moo-bar-akl at the end which means ""blessed Eid,"" that

would be great.
Paragraph two :
* end with ""and by the fasting which is one of its five pillars.""
Paragraph three: too political: Keep first line and take out the rest - the part on Iraq is especially out of place in a religious message.SIGN UP"	['Obama', 'Clinton', 'McCarthy']	[]

Complicated business.""2:45 AM -- ABC News: Hillary Clinton has reportedly called Donald Trump to concede.2:40 AM --by Breitbart News8 Nov 2016WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump was elected America's 45th president Tuesday, an astonishing victory for a celebrity businessman and political novice who capitalized on voters' economic anxieties, took advantage of racial tensions and overcame a string of sexual assault allegations on his way to the White House.His triumph over Hillary Clinton will end eight years of Democratic dominance of the White House and threatens to undo major achievements of President Barack Obama. He's pledged to act quickly to repeal Obama's landmark health care law, revoke the nuclear agreement with Iran and rewrite important trade deals with other countries, particularly Mexico and Canada.The Republican blasted through Democrats' longstanding firewall, carrying Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that hadn't voted for a GOP presidential candidate since the 1980s. He needed to win nearly all of the competitive battleground states, and he did just that, claiming Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and others.Global stock markets and U.S. stock futures plunged deeply, reflecting investor alarm over what a Trump presidency might mean for the economy and trade.A New York real estate developer who lives in a sparking Manhattan high-rise, Trump forged a striking connection with white, working class Americans who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying country. He cast immigration, both from Latin America and the Middle East, as the root of the problems plaguing many Americans and taped into fears of terrorism emanating at home and abroad.Trump will take office with Congress expected to be fully under Republican control. GOP Senate candidates fended off Democratic challengers in key states and appeared poised to maintain the majority. Republicans also maintained their grip on the House.Senate control means Trump will have great leeway in appointing Supreme Court justices, which could mean a major change to the right that would last for decades.Trump upended years of political convention on his way to the White House, leveling harshly personal insults on his rivals, deeming Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers, and vowing to temporarily suspend Muslim immigration to the U.S. He never released his tax returns, breaking with decades of campaign tradition, and eschewed the kind of robust data and field efforts that helped Obama win two terms in the White House, relying instead on his large, free-wheeling rallies to energize supporters. His campaign was frequently in chaos, and he cycled through three campaign managers this year.His final campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, touted the team's accomplishments as the final results rolled in, writing on Twitter that ""rally crowds matter"" and ""we expanded the map.""The mood at Clinton's party grew bleak as the night wore out, with some supporters leaving, others crying and hugging each other. Top campaign aides stopped returning calls and texts, as Clinton and her family hunkered down in a luxury hotel watching the returns.At 2 a.m., Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told the crowd to head home for the night.

Marco Rubio won re-election to his seat in Florida, a race he entered late, only after his presidential campaign faltered.And Tammy Duckworth, the Democratic Illinois congresswoman, defeated incumbent GOP Sen. Mark Kirk in a race that was widely predicted would hand Democrats one of the seats they were looking for.The map for the Senate favored Democrats this year, with all but one of nine seats most likely to decide the balance being held by Republicans.The nine races where a seat is open or most likely to change hands were in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Nevada, Florida and Indiana. Of that group, seven seats belong to Republican incumbents trying to hang on. Only two are open seats, Indiana and Nevada. The only one in Democratic hands presently is Nevada, where Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is retiring.Coming into Tuesday, the House seemed a much safer bet for Republicans -- and the election night tallies proved true. The GOP held an enormous 59-seat advantage coming into Tuesday. The non-partisan Cook political report listed 18 seats as pure tossups, not enough to flip control of the chamber to Democrats, even if they ran the table in all of them.9:45 PM -- Trump projected to win Louisiana.9:43 PM -- Trumpmentum.NYTs ""Our best guess is that Donald J.

The news of the crash is likely to fuel speculation of outside tampering or ""hacking,"" especially given Colorado's status as an important battleground state, where both campaigns have spent time and resources.Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had initially pulled advertising from Colorado, but put resources back into the state as it became more competitive again, and as Republican nominee Donald Trump campaigned there.5:51 PM --The March presidential primary already shattered a four-decade record with 2.5 million voters.MLive quotes Johnson saying absentee ballot returns are 18 percent over typical elections. Long lines were reported in Grand Rapids, where Donald Trump made a late-night campaign stop on Monday, and in Detroit.Detroit polling places reported ""disorganization,"" ballot outages, and frustrated voters giving up and leaving. One Detroit voter was unable to leave a polling place on the east side of the city, because his hand got stuck in a voting machine.However, Johnson said of overall performance by voting machines: ""So far, so good.""""Things turned heated in Ypsilanti Township, southeast of Ann Arbor, where two voters got into an altercation about their respective candidates.

Local Republicans have taken to social media @PhillyGOP to share their accounts with the nation in real-time.A small sampling of these tweets (with ""minority inspector"" referring to Republican inspectors) just from the morning hours of Election Day include:Most of these tweets were tagged with #VoterFraud.Political analysts sometimes say that Pennsylvania is ""Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Alabama,"" meaning that there are two Democratic strongholds in the Keystone State, surrounded by vast expanses of deep-red support for limited government, faith, marriage, and the Second Amendment.Philadelphia is nothing short of notorious for voter fraud. One of the most infamous examples of voting-law violations in modern history was when The Justice Department secured a court judgment against the Black Panthers for a videotaped incident of voter intimidation, a case that after the government won but before enforcement could take place, Barack Obama's then-new Attorney General Eric Holder to drop the case and let the Black Panthers go.Some polls are split regarding whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is likely to win Pennsylvania, with Republicans complaining that voter fraud is so rampant in Philadelphia that it could steal a victory from Donald Trump if the margin is close.Trump has been pounding away on the theme that aspects of the system are ""rigged"" urging his supporters to turn out in massive numbers to ensure victory when the polls close.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Voters who get in line before the polling locations' closing times are allowed to vote, but the Trump campaign's lawsuit alleges poll workers at the direction of Gloria allowed people who did not get in the line before the polls had closed.Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston described one of the locations in a Politico article published before the lawsuit.The line Friday evening stretched outside Cardenas Market in Las Vegas, teeming with Hispanic voters eager to cast ballots.Many had to wait for hours on the last day of a fortnight of early voting in Nevada, plied by food and exhortations from activists who didn't have to do much.

The situation escalated to a dispute between one Democrat clerk and one Republican clerk, David Booth, from the twenty-third and twenty-fourth precincts.The precinct's Supervisor of Elections, Dr. Brenda Snipes, fired the two clerks on the spot after learning of the situation.Booth told NBC 6 Miami that ""he was one of the two clerks fired and told to leave the property."" According to the local outlet's description of Booth's account, ""there were allegations poll watchers were overstepping their boundaries inside the polling location and involved in voter intimidation.""Two more clerks have been brought in to replace the two that were terminated and voting is continuing smoothly.Florida, with its 29 electoral votes, is a must-win state for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and the polls have stayed tight between them right up to Election Day. The RealClearPolitics average of Florida polls currently shows Trump with a .2% lead, well within the margin of error for virtually all polls.1:27 PM --The error was due to a calibration issue in Lebanon County's voting machines, where five machines out of the 270 machines available in the county malfunctioned, Penn Live reported.Voters saw the errors after they reviewed their ballots before officially filing them.When questioned about the issue, no one reported their votes were incorrectly cast, according to Lebanon County Election Director Michael Anderson.Anderson said the issue was fixed and there was no indication that anyone's votes were incorrectly registered in the system.Other states have also reported problems with their voting machines on Election Day.In Utah, poll workers have had to resort to paper ballots because the machines in Washington County faced a programming problem.In Texas, a computer used by election clerks at a Houston-area polling station malfunctioned and voters had to be sent to another polling station two miles away.1:03 PM --From the Morning Consult website: Voters heading to the polls Tuesday are twice as likely to say they want a president who is a ""strong leader"" than in 2012, according to Morning Consult/POLITICO exit data.More than one-third (36 percent) of 2016 voters said being a strong leader was the most important quality when picking a president, compared with 18 percent of voters who said the same during 2012 election. It's an opinion held regardless of partisan leanings: 35 percent of Democrats, 34 percent of independents and 39 percent of Republicans said that was most important. After being a strong leader, voters said having a vision for the future, at 29 percent, was most important. Sixteen percent picked having a candidate share their values and care about people like them, respectively.Democrats were more likely than Republicans to place more value in whether the candidate cares about them (20 percent to 12 percent), while GOP voters said it was more important that the candidate shares their values (19 percent to 14 percent).Morning Consult, which was founded in 2013, is considered the ""breakout"" polling company of the 2016 election.1:02 PM --""Working-class turnout is looking much higher than expected,"" Luntz tweeted.BREAKING: Watch Michigan.Working-class turnout is looking much higher than expected.

An excerpt of his film TrumpLand, where he discusses Trump's anti-establishment appeal, received millions of views as Trump supporters set it to dramatic music and images.12:26 PM --Utah Director of Elections Mark Thomas says a programming problem has affected all voting in Washington County, but so far appears it appears limited to that county.He says about 52,000 registered voters there have yet to cast their ballots.Election workers are trying to fix the computer problem and hope they can start using the voting machines later in the day.Thomas says officials were prepared with backup paper ballots.

Also, African-American support for Clinton may be sharply down from support for President Barack Obama in 2016.11:41 AM --by Ben Kew8 Nov 2016He went on to claim the organisation had no political bias against Hillary Clinton but could not ""publish information we do not have"" on the campaigns of Donald Trump and third-party candidates.Assange added that the policy position he has supported is that of Green Party candidate Jill Stein, as she has expressed desire to protect whistleblowers and maintained that WikiLeaks' work should be explicitly protected by the First Amendment.You can read the full statement below:""In recent months, WikiLeaks and I personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the Clinton campaign says about itself to itself. That pressure has come from the campaign's allies, including the Obama administration, and from liberals who are anxious about who will be elected US President.On the eve of the election, it is important to restate why we have published what we have.The right to receive and impart true information is the guiding principle of WikiLeaks - an organization that has a staff and organizational mission far beyond myself. Our organization defends the public's right to be informed.This is why, irrespective of the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election, the real victor is the US public which is better informed as a result of our work.The US public has thoroughly engaged with WikiLeaks' election related publications which number more than one hundred thousand documents. Millions of Americans have poured over the leaks and passed on their citations to each other and to us. It is an open model of journalism that gatekeepers are uncomfortable with, but which is perfectly harmonious with the First Amendment.We publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. When we have material that fulfills this criteria, we publish. We had information that fit our editorial criteria which related to the Sanders and Clinton campaign (DNC Leaks) and the Clinton political campaign and Foundation (Podesta Emails). No-one disputes the public importance of these publications. It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election.At the same time, we cannot publish what we do not have. To date, we have not received information on Donald Trump's campaign, or Jill Stein's campaign, or Gary Johnson's campaign or any of the other candidates that fufills our stated editorial criteria. As a result of publishing Clinton's cables and indexing her emails we are seen as domain experts on Clinton archives. So it is natural that Clinton sources come to us.We publish as fast as our resources will allow and as fast as the public can absorb it.That is our commitment to ourselves, to our sources, and to the public.This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election. The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers. I spoke at the launch of the campaign for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, because her platform addresses the need to protect them. This is an issue that is close to my heart because of the Obama administration's inhuman and degrading treatment of one of our alleged sources, Chelsea Manning. But WikiLeaks publications are not an attempt to get Jill Stein elected or to take revenge over Ms Manning's treatment either.Publishing is what we do. To withhold the publication of such information until after the election would have been to favour one of the candidates above the public's right to know.
This is after all what happened when the New York Times withheld evidence of illegal mass surveillance of the US population for a year until after the 2004 election, denying the public a critical understanding of the incumbent president George W Bush, which probably secured his reelection. The current editor of the New York Times has distanced himself from that decision and rightly so.The US public defends free speech more passionately, but the First Amendment only truly lives through its repeated exercise. The First Amendment explicitly prevents the executive from attempting to restrict anyone's ability to speak and publish freely. The First Amendment does not privilege old media, with its corporate advertisers and dependencies on incumbent power factions, over WikiLeaks' model of scientific journalism or an individual's decision to inform their friends on social media. The First Amendment unapologetically nurtures the democratization of knowledge. With the Internet, it has reached its full potential.Yet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of Senator McCarthy and the red scare, Wikileaks, Green Party candidate Stein, Glenn Greenwald and Clinton's main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. The Clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with Russia. The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications--because none exists.In the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them - a reason for censorship the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate.WikiLeaks' decade-long pristine record for authentication remains. Our key publications this round have even been proven through the cryptographic signatures of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them.We have endured intense criticism, primarily from Clinton supporters, for our publications. Many long-term supporters have been frustrated because we have not addressed this criticism in a systematic way or responded to a number of false narratives about Wikileaks' motivation or sources. Ultimately, however, if WL reacted to every false claim, we would have to divert resources from our primary work.WikiLeaks, like all publishers, is ultimately accountable to its funders. Those funders are you. Our resources are entirely made up of contributions from the public and our book sales. This allows us to be principled, independent and free in a way no other influential media organization is. But it also means that we do not have the resources of CNN, MSNBC or the Clinton campaign to constantly rebuff criticism.Yet if the press obeys considerations above informing the public, we are no longer talking about a free press, and we are no longer talking about an informed public.Wikileaks remains committed to publishing information that informs the public, even if many, especially those in power, would prefer not to see it. WikiLeaks must publish. It must publish and be damned.11:29 AM --WABC, an ABC affiliate, reports the two women were arrested.BREAKING: 2 Topless Women Arrested For Protesting Trump At His Polling Location - https://t.co/ZsF6fkW6RL pic.twitter.com/1TjVeh8kGE-- Breaking911 (@Breaking911) November 8, 2016The women had painted a ""Femen"" slogan on their backs.Topless protestors have crashed Donald Trump's Manhattan polling place https://t.co/Q2P9EO7FHq pic.twitter.com/l2P4Q18iut-- PIX11 News (@PIX11News) November 8, 2016The incident occurred more than an hour before the Republican nominee arrived to cast his vote at P.S. 59.The women reportedly entered the precinct and then took off their tops.

These die-hard voters are proud to have the first word on the big vote.Clinton won more votes in Dixville and Hart's Location, but Trump was the overwhelming favorite in Millsfield, with a 16-4 edge.Libertarian Gary Johnson picked up three votes.

Voters heading to the polls Tuesday are twice as likely to say they want a president who is a ""strong leader"" than in 2012, according to Morning Consult/POLITICO exit data.
More than one-third (36 percent) of 2016 voters said being a strong leader was the most important quality when picking a president, compared with 18 percent of voters who said the same during 2012 election. It's an opinion held regardless of partisan leanings: 35 percent of Democrats, 34 percent of independents and 39 percent of Republicans said that was most important. 
After being a strong leader, voters said having a vision for the future, at 29 percent, was most important. Sixteen percent picked having a candidate share their values and care about people like them, respectively.
Democrats were more likely than Republicans to place more value in whether the candidate cares about them (20 percent to 12 percent), while GOP voters said it was more important that the candidate shares their values (19 percent to 14 percent).

-- Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) November 7, 2016""In recent months, WikiLeaks and I personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the Clinton campaign says about itself to itself. That pressure has come from the campaign's allies, including the Obama administration, and from liberals who are anxious about who will be elected US President.
On the eve of the election, it is important to restate why we have published what we have.
The right to receive and impart true information is the guiding principle of WikiLeaks - an organization that has a staff and organizational mission far beyond myself. Our organization defends the public's right to be informed.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);This is why, irrespective of the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election, the real victor is the US public which is better informed as a result of our work.
The US public has thoroughly engaged with WikiLeaks' election related publications which number more than one hundred thousand documents. Millions of Americans have poured over the leaks and passed on their citations to each other and to us. It is an open model of journalism that gatekeepers are uncomfortable with, but which is perfectly harmonious with the First Amendment.
We publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. When we have material that fulfills this criteria, we publish. We had information that fit our editorial criteria which related to the Sanders and Clinton campaign (DNC Leaks) and the Clinton political campaign and Foundation (Podesta Emails). No-one disputes the public importance of these publications. It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election.
At the same time, we cannot publish what we do not have. To date, we have not received information on Donald Trump's campaign, or Jill Stein's campaign, or Gary Johnson's campaign or any of the other candidates that fufills our stated editorial criteria. As a result of publishing Clinton's cables and indexing her emails we are seen as domain experts on Clinton archives. So it is natural that Clinton sources come to us.
We publish as fast as our resources will allow and as fast as the public can absorb it.
That is our commitment to ourselves, to our sources, and to the public.
This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election. The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers. I spoke at the launch of the campaign for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, because her platform addresses the need to protect them. This is an issue that is close to my heart because of the Obama administration's inhuman and degrading treatment of one of our alleged sources, Chelsea Manning. But WikiLeaks publications are not an attempt to get Jill Stein elected or to take revenge over Ms Manning's treatment either.
Publishing is what we do. To withhold the publication of such information until after the election would have been to favour one of the candidates above the public's right to know.
This is after all what happened when the New York Times withheld evidence of illegal mass surveillance of the US population for a year until after the 2004 election, denying the public a critical understanding of the incumbent president George W Bush, which probably secured his reelection. The current editor of the New York Times has distanced himself from that decision and rightly so.
The US public defends free speech more passionately, but the First Amendment only truly lives through its repeated exercise. The First Amendment explicitly prevents the executive from attempting to restrict anyone's ability to speak and publish freely. The First Amendment does not privilege old media, with its corporate advertisers and dependencies on incumbent power factions, over WikiLeaks' model of scientific journalism or an individual's decision to inform their friends on social media. The First Amendment unapologetically nurtures the democratization of knowledge. With the Internet, it has reached its full potential.
Yet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of Senator McCarthy and the red scare, Wikileaks, Green Party candidate Stein, Glenn Greenwald and Clinton's main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. The Clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with Russia. The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications--because none exists.
In the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them - a reason for censorship the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate.
WikiLeaks' decade-long pristine record for authentication remains. Our key publications this round have even been proven through the cryptographic signatures of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them.
We have endured intense criticism, primarily from Clinton supporters, for our publications. Many long-term supporters have been frustrated because we have not addressed this criticism in a systematic way or responded to a number of false narratives about Wikileaks' motivation or sources. Ultimately, however, if WL reacted to every false claim, we would have to divert resources from our primary work.
WikiLeaks, like all publishers, is ultimately accountable to its funders. Those funders are you. Our resources are entirely made up of contributions from the public and our book sales. This allows us to be principled, independent and free in a way no other influential media organization is. But it also means that we do not have the resources of CNN, MSNBC or the Clinton campaign to constantly rebuff criticism.
Yet if the press obeys considerations above informing the public, we are no longer talking about a free press, and we are no longer talking about an informed public.
Wikileaks remains committed to publishing information that informs the public, even if many, especially those in power, would prefer not to see it. WikiLeaks must publish. It must publish and be damned.BREAKING: 2 Topless Women Arrested For Protesting Trump At His Polling Location - https://t.co/ZsF6fkW6RL pic.twitter.com/1TjVeh8kGE

The news of the crash is likely to fuel speculation of outside tampering or ""hacking,"" especially given Colorado's status as an important battleground state, where both campaigns have spent time and resources.Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had initially pulled advertising from Colorado, but put resources back into the state as it became more competitive again, and as Republican nominee Donald Trump campaigned there.campaigned thereby Alex SwoyerDonald Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump spoke to Breitbart on Tuesday afternoon, with just hours left before polls closed on Election Day, explaining that she feels a sense of calm knowing the family did all they could to get her father-in-law elected President of the United States.""We're very excited.

It's an opinion held regardless of partisan leanings: 35 percent of Democrats, 34 percent of independents and 39 percent of Republicans said that was most important.After being a strong leader, voters said having a vision for the future, at 29 percent, was most important. Sixteen percent picked having a candidate share their values and care about people like them, respectively.Democrats were more likely than Republicans to place more value in whether the candidate cares about them (20 percent to 12 percent), while GOP voters said it was more important that the candidate shares their values (19 percent to 14 percent).Morning Consult, which was founded in 2013, is considered the ""breakout"" polling company of the 2016 election.the ""breakout"" polling company of the 2016 electionby Michelle Moonsby Neil Munroby Ben Kew"	['Toomey', 'Long', 'Trump', 'Carson', 'Kirk', 'Rubio', 'Black', 'Williams', 'Ross', 'Sanders', 'Grassley', 'Portman', 'Curbelo', 'Burr', 'Cook', 'Obama', 'Rush', 'Duckworth', 'Reid', 'Wolf', 'Leahy', 'Clinton', 'Warner', 'Pence', 'Manchin', 'Love', 'Moore', 'Clark', 'Romney', 'McConnell', 'McCarthy', 'Kasich', 'Paul', 'Warren']	['god', 'abortion', 'guns']

Only 11 percent want to see one million or more foreigners arrive in the U.S. every year.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBroken down by party, 68 percent of Republicans, along with 45 percent of Democrats, want immigration reduced to zero or halved to 500,000 annually.Allowing illegal aliens to stay in the U.S. is strongly frowned upon: 58 percent said that illegal aliens should not be permitted to stay in the country, even if they do not commit a ""serious crime."" Thirty-one percent said they should be allowed to stay.A majority, 59 percent, said that the first thing that should be done about illegal immigration is requiring all U.S. employers to verify the legality of their workers.Asked if they supported encouraging illegal aliens to return home by penalizing employers who hire them, cutting them off from welfare benefits, and having federal agents cooperating with local law enforcement to get them off the streets, 56 percent said they supported such policies. Thirty percent said they did not, while 14 percent were not sure.Notably, the poll did not present respondents with the false choice of either mass deportations or amnesty for illegal aliens.Only 12 percent believe that the U.S. government has done ""too much"" to enforce immigration law, while 54 percent say it has not done enough.Amnesty and ongoing mass immigration is particularly unpopular amongst Republicans: 76 percent say the government does too little to enforce immigration law; 76 percent want U.S. employers to verify the legal status of their workers; 79 percent disagree that illegal aliens should be allowed to stay in the U.S. if they do not commit a ""serious crime.""Hispanics are just as likely as other Americans to be affected by historically extreme immigration levels and in large numbers support enforcement and reducing overall immigration:One interesting finding is that a large share of Hispanics support enforcing immigration laws. Of likely Hispanic voters, 51 percent responded that efforts to enforce the law have been ""too little,"" compared to 38 percent who indicated that it was ""too much"" or ""just right.""Among Hispanics, 49 percent indicated that they would support a policy of causing illegal immigrants to return home by enforcing the law, compared to 36 percent who opposed such a strategy.However, Hispanics were almost evenly split on whether we should require employers to verify legal status first (48 percent) or first give illegal immigrants work permits and a path to citizenship first (50 percent).On legal immigrants, 52 percent of Hispanic voters indicated that they wanted to allow 500,000 or fewer legal immigrants in to the country each year, about half the current level. Just 9 percent wanted to allow in one million legal immigrants a year, which is the current level; and just 13 percent wanted it increased above the current level of one million a year. Like other voters, about one-quarter of Hispanics said they were unsure about this question.As Breitbart News has reported, 75 percent believe Americans should get U.S. jobs, compared to three percent who think more workers should be imported to fill those positions: ""There are roughly 94 million Americans operating outside the labor market today. Yet every year the U.S. admits one million plus foreign nationals on green cards, one million guest workers, dependents, and refugees, and half a million foreign students.""Pulse Opinion Research for the Center for Immigration Studies questioned 1,000 likely voters from November 1 to November 3.One interesting finding is that a large share of Hispanics support enforcing immigration laws. Of likely Hispanic voters, 51 percent responded that efforts to enforce the law have been ""too little,"" compared to 38 percent who indicated that it was ""too much"" or ""just right.""
Among Hispanics, 49 percent indicated that they would support a policy of causing illegal immigrants to return home by enforcing the law, compared to 36 percent who opposed such a strategy.

Seventy-seven percent of those cases, 132 out of 172, were foreign-born. In contrast, during that same five-year period, 66 percent of all active TB cases in the United States were foreign-born.""Among foreign-born TB cases in Utah from 2011 to 2015, 38% had immigration visas upon first entry into the United States, 24% were refugees, 8% had student visas, 4% had employment visas, 1% were asylees/parolees, 1% had tourist visas, and 23% had other immigration status,"" the Utah Department of Health reported.News of the 32 cases of active TB among recently-resettled refugees in Utah increases the known number of active TB cases among refugees in the sixteen states for which Breitbart News has obtained data to 508.Utah now has the second highest number of refugees with active TB, but still lags far behind Minnesota, which with 304 cases of active TB among refugees has reported more than nine times the number of cases of Utah.A complete breakdown of cases of active TB in these fifteen other states is:Minnesota (304), Wisconsin (27), Nebraska (21), Louisiana (21), Michigan (19),  Vermont (17), Colorado (16), Florida (11), Ohio (11 in one county), Idaho (7), Kentucky (9 in one county), North Dakota (4 in one county),  Indiana (4), California (3), and Tennessee, where two refugees have been diagnosed with the very dangerous, multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB.According to the Utah Department of Health's Tuberculosis in Utah 2011-2015 report, Utah has a lower rate of TB than the rest of the United States:In 2015, the TB rate in Utah was 1.2 cases per 100,000 population. For the five-year period from 2011 to 2015, Utah had an average TB rate of 1.2
cases per 100,000 population. From 1993 to 2015, Utah's TB rate was, on average, about one-third of the national rate. The
US TB rate in 2015 was 3.0 cases per 100,000 population.Were it not for the disproportionately higher rate of foreign-born cases of TB in the state, Utah's TB rate would be even lower.The breakdown of foreign-born cases by the top six counties of origin over these five years in Utah includes Mexico (29.5 percent), with 39 cases out of 132, India (9.1 percent), with 12 cases out of 132, Peru (7.6 percent), with 10 cases out of 132, Phillipines (6.8 percent) with nine cases out of 132, Burma (4.5 percent) with six cases out of 132, and Somalia (4.5 percent), with six cases out of 132:During this five-year period between 2011 and 2015, a total of 5,163 refugees were resettled in Utah, primarily from high TB burden countries such as Somalia (1,188 refugees), Burma (963), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (350), according to the State Department's interactive website.Iraq (972) and Sudan (250) rounded out the top five countries of origin for refugees resettled in Utah between 2011 and 2015.Increasingly, active TB has been concentrated in the urban area of Salt Lake City.""From 2011 to 2015, Salt Lake County Health District accounted for 68% of the state's TB cases,"" the report notes.
""In 2015, this district accounted for 84% of the reported TB cases in the state,"" the report states.The issue of refugees does not appear to be a top issue in the Utah presidential contest, as it is in states like Minnesota and Michigan.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump opposes increasing refugee resettlement, has called for a pause in resettling refugees from Syria and other countries with a history of hostility to the United States, and in Minnesota on Sunday stated that ""a Trump administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where they are being placed.""Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has said she wants to increase the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the United States by 550 percent and is in favor of increasing refugee resettlement across the board.Third-party candidate Evan McMullin, a Mormon in a state with a 55 percent population of Mormons, is on record as stating that the United States should accept refugees from Syria.According to his campaign website: ""Evan served as a Mormon missionary in Brazil and Volunteer Refugee Resettlement Officer in Amman, Jordan on behalf of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.""His broader immigration policy, as found on his campaign website, states:The way that we deal with immigration will have a profound impact on our identity as Americans. We must be careful to preserve our nation's unity and commitment to fairness. At the same time, our debates and our policies should reflect the civility and tolerance that helped forge a nation out of immigrants from every nation on earth. By replacing divisive rhetoric with genuine action to secure the border, we can work towards immigration reform that makes America safer, fairer, and more prosperous.Recent polls have placed McMullin within striking distance, though he has faded of late.The Real Clear Politics average of polls, as of Election Day morning, rates Utah as ""Likely Trump,"" and shows Trump with a 10.4 percent lead, at 37.4 percent, with Clinton in second at 27 percent and McMullin in third at 25 percent.Utah has six electoral college votes.As of Election Day, the Real Clear Politics electoral college map with no tossups gives Clinton 272 electoral college votes and Trump 266 electoral college votes.270 electoral college votes are needed to win the presidency.Minnesota (304), Wisconsin (27), Nebraska (21), Louisiana (21), Michigan (19),  Vermont (17), Colorado (16), Florida (11), Ohio (11 in one county), Idaho (7), Kentucky (9 in one county), North Dakota (4 in one county),  Indiana (4), California (3), and Tennessee, where two refugees have been diagnosed with the very dangerous, multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB.In 2015, the TB rate in Utah was 1.2 cases per 100,000 population.

""The Democratic Party has a vision, Hillary Clinton has a vision, Donald Trump has a totally different vision for this nation with the Republican Party. This isn't difficult to figure out if you are a Christian.""The Rev Graham, son of renowned evangelist Billy Graham, acknowledged that for many, voting for Trump isn't easy, while insisting that it is nonetheless the better choice and that he is a ""changed man.""""You may have to hold your nose and vote,"" Graham said. ""I have people that say, 'Well I don't like Donald Trump, I don't like what he says.' Well I don't like what he said either, I promise I don't like it. But those are things that he said 11 years ago, not something that he said today.""""I think Donald Trump has changed,"" Graham added. ""I think God is working on his heart and in his life. But people have to make up their own mind.""In a Facebook post some weeks ago, Graham stated that ""the difference between the candidates is night and day.""""Some candidates have entire political ads talking about how they spent their career fighting for the rights of children,"" he said.

However, nobody would be shocked if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also serves as foreign minister, decides to appoint for the job somebody close to him, because of the importance he places on relations with Turkey.As soon as Israel announces the appointment of the ambassador and sends the envoy to Ankara, Turkey will reciprocate. Turkish media has reported that that the leading candidate for the embassy in Tel Aviv is Kamel Okam, a diplomat who is a very close confidant of one of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's important advisors.The decision to renew diplomatic ties with Turkey, to the level of exchanging ambassadors, was made more than four months ago as part of the reconciliation deal signed between the nations, which both recalled their envoys after the Mavi Marmara flotilla incident in May 2010.Last Spring, during the stretch run of negotiations, it seemed that time was running out for both sides and that they were each interested in ending this bleak period in their relations and quickly turning a new page.

Pollak (@joelpollak) November 8, 2016The idea that a Republican nominee would be seeking votes in the ice-blue heart of a reliably Democratic state on the eve of an election would have seemed preposterous -- and perhaps it still is.But it is a calculated gamble -- namely, that Trump will be able to flip Michigan, and perhaps other traditionally Democratic states, thereby overcoming the firewall that has frustrated Republican ambitions for the Oval Office in recent elections. Michigan casts 16 votes in the Electoral College.In his address, Trump hit many of his usual campaign points, focusing in particular on stopping jobs from leaving Michigan for Mexico and other foreign destinations. He mentioned, as he has throughout the past several weeks, the recent decision of Ford to move its production facilities to Mexico.At one point, there was a minor disruption as four young women in Hillary Clinton T-shirts formed a circle at the edge of the rally, held hands, and chanted ""Hillary! Hillary!"" before being escorted out by police.Many of those in the hall had brought their children with them. Sue, from Northwest Indiana, brought her daughter Rediet along to the rally to learn about the political process. She said that Trump had not been her first choice -- she preferred Dr. Ben Carson in the Republican primary -- but that she could never vote for Hillary Clinton.""I was an adult voting when [Bill] Clinton was first in office,"" she said. ""I know what they're about for all these years.""Her daughter, she said, had ""voted"" for Trump in a classroom straw poll, when many of the other children had chosen Clinton.""I'm just praying -- whatever happens, God's in control,"" she said.Trump's Michigan rally came at the end of a five-rally sprint that began in the morning in Florida, and continued through North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire before concluding in Grand Rapids.Afterwards, the Trump campaign staff and the press boarded their planes to return to New York City, where Trump will vote tomorrow, and where both Trump and Hillary Clinton are holding victory parties.Joel B.

They are wanted on charges of incitement to terror after providing the detainees with religious justification for the attacks.The source said that Hamas forces raided tower no. 132 in Alzahrahh in the central Gaza Strip, near the Nusseirat refugee camp, in search of a Salafi cleric named Abu Anass, who is suspected of being an associate of the wanted clerics.A Salafi source confirmed to Breitbart Jerusalem that several days ago a Salafi activist was arrested there, but said he claimed the arrested individual was an elderly man suffering from diabetes and practically blind ""who has no connection to the ring Hamas are after.""Over the past few days, Hamas officials said that Egypt is considering a new Gaza policy. Hamas' Khalil Elhayeh said that his movement is working to ensure the success of this policy, adding that Hamas welcomes any measure that could mitigate Gaza's plight.Over the coming days, a delegation of Gaza businessmen is expected to travel to Cairo to draft a policy on cross-border business transactions and exports together with Egyptian officials.Hamas' breakthrough vis-a-vis the Egyptian government is the result, among other things, of the crackdown on Salafism in Gaza and a certain degree of rapprochement with Fatah strongman Mohammed Dahlan, a close associate of Egyptian President Abdel Fatah Sisi and opponent of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the official said.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

19	19	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/07/donald-trump-achieved-america-already/	Election Day: What Donald Trump Has Achieved for America Already	GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan -- The conventional wisdom is that the 2016 election has seen politics hit new lows. And in some ways -- the rhetoric of the candidates, the partisan behavior of the media -- it has.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBut it has also seen the beginning of a democratic renewal -- thanks to Donald Trump. And that remains true whether you are voting against him, or voting for him simply to reject Hillary Clinton.Trump did more than break the stranglehold of the Republican establishment. Were that all he had accomplished, it would have been admirable enough. But he did something more: he reached out to Americans who had been forgotten by the political process and gave them a reason to care.Think about the fact that Trump chose to hold the final rally of his campaign in Michigan. Not just as a stunt, either: the most recent poll, which came out just hours before Trump boarded his plane for Grand Rapids, shows Trump ahead by 2 points in the state.Democrats spent the day campaigning here. They know the danger is real.Trump is taking the biggest gamble of recent political memory, and reaching out to the very core of the traditional Democratic base in the hope of flipping a blue state. For the first time since Ronald Reagan, a Republican is courting the vote of the American worker.Trump is not just attempting a win, but a realignment -- and perhaps one long overdue.The result, once the dust settles, is likely to be a more active, lively, and engaged political process -- one where the views and concerns of working, law-abiding Americans are no longer shunted aside.Bernie Sanders could not achieve that because he wanted to fight for them, but not to win for them. Trump wants both.Well before the votes are counted, it is safe to proclaim: today is a new day in American politics.There is something intrinsically great about this nation's ability to save itself, and Trump has helped it begin that process. And just in time, too -- for the challenges that lie ahead are as big as any we have yet overcome.In 24 hours, we will know if he will be the one to lead us through.Joel B.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTrump is at 48.4 percent, she is at 46.5 percent, according to the poll from the little-known polling firm, which is also spotlighting evidence that Trump has hidden support from an additional 3 percent to 9 percent of voters who don't want to reveal their true opinions. Breitbart News asked Trafalgar's CEO why readers should trust the firm's predictions amid so many other polls that show Trump lagging Clinton by 2 percent in the critical state. ""On Wednesday, I'm either going to be guy who got it right, or nobody is going to listen to me any more,"" responded company CEO Robert Cahaly. ""That's why ... [and] I take this craft seriously,"" he told Breitbart News. In effect, the company is betting its future by publicly testing -- at its own expense -- its own methods. Cahaly said his polls are designed to capture opinions from people who otherwise avoid lengthy interviews on the phone. That's difficult under normal circumstances, but it is especially difficult when many people are reluctant to pick a side in this hard-fought election.He keeps his questionnaires limited to a minute or two, relies mostly on computer-delivered phone questionnaires and he probes for hidden preferences by asking people who their neighbors are supporting. That question about neighbors allows respondents to present their preferences as the opinion of others, so minimizing possible fear of stigma or embarrassment for supporting Trump.In Pennsylvania, the ""neighbors"" question boosts Trump's score by 4.4 points, up to 52.8 percent. Similarly, Clinton's score drops from 46.5 percent down to 40 percent. That shift converts a 2-point gap into a 12-point valley. The poll was conducted Nov. 3 to Nov. 45, with 1,300 respondents.The firm conducted similar polling in Michigan on Nov. 6, where the panel of 1,200 respondents shows a 2-point Trump lead, 48.5 percent to 46.8 percent. Michigan's ""neighbor question"" showed a 3.6 percent boost for Trump, giving him a 12.3 point advantage. When quizzed by Breitbart News about the reliability of a ""hidden vote,"" Cahaly offered several arguments for its existence.His said his surveys during the primaries were unusually accurate, and also revealed hidden support for Trump, he said. The support was revealed when respondents were asked to respond to a computerized voice on the phone, versus when talking to a live person. ""We did live callers and push-button [telephone polls] and we determined there was always a 4.5 point bounce for Trump [with computerized polls],"" he said. He says the people most likely to hide their votes are women and college-educated professionals, matching evidence from other polls.Whenever he asks the neighbors question, the answers consistently show a hidden vote for Trump worth three to nine points, said Cahaly.The question never exposes hidden support for Clinton, which would appear if there is a bipartisan and equal reluctance to reveal voting preference. ""In most [political] races, the change is usually lower than 2.5 points, and the candidate who is benefitting from the hidden vote goes up, but the other candidate goes not go down,"" he said. In this 2016 race, Clinton never gains points, and also goes down when Trump gains points, he said. ""I believe that is happening because the Trump campaign is different from other campaigns ... not just the candidate is being attacked, his supporters are being attacked,"" he said. ""When is the last time in a presidential race when the candidate's supporters are called 'deplorable,' 'racist,' 'ignorant'?""This race is also different because so many voters are disgusted at Washington and want to send a message, regardless of the candidate, he said. ""They're voting against the system... they want to send a message .... to the system that has done them wrong [so the election] is their middle finger,"" he said.Many polls are inaccurate, partly because many things change during a political campaign. Estimated turnout, voting patterns and issues change from day-to-day. The changes force pollsters to constantly tweak their polls during a campaign, and the changes ensures that collections of polls can be way off from the final results.The polling errors are also very different from state to state. For example, pollsters in 2012 overestimated GOP support in Michigan, but underestimated support in North Carolina and Florida.Reminder of where public polling error occurred in 2012.

Mike Pence, who spoke earlier,.""Tomorrow, the American working class will strike back,"" Trump announced to raucous cheers.He also sent the arena into loud cheers by announcing the support of New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady, and head coach Bill Belichick.He read a letter from Belichick, praising Trump for fighting a tough campaign against relentless pressure from the media, and closing with the hope that Trump would win and ""make America great again.""In addition, Trump informed the audience about the latest poll numbers, including polls showing Trump leading in Michigan, where the Trump campaign would make its last stop of 2016 later Monday evening.Trump began his remarks by talking about drugs in New Hampshire, reiterating his promise to get rid of them.""You were the first ones who told me how bad the drug problem really is,"" he said, praising New Hampshire and going on to explain the impact that had on him later in the campaign, where he has mentioned the issue frequently in other states.Trump also touched on his major campaign messages of the last several weeks.""Real change begins by resorting honesty in government. Let's start by getting rid of Clinton. That's the best,"" he said, prompting chants of ""Lock her up!""""Her campaign, as revealed by Wikileaks, has spoken horribly about Catholics and evangelicals,"" he reminded them.He cited yet another debate question that Hillary Clinton had received, and drove the point home by implying she was unfit to be commander-in-chief because of her cheating.""You know, if you go to West Point, or Annapolis, or the Air Force Academy, and you get the questions, and you don't report yourself, they throw you out.""Trump also spoke about repealing Obamacare, ending the Syrian refugee program, ad rebuilding the military, mentioning the naval shipyard at Portsmouth.And he welcomed supporters who drove up from Massachusetts: ""Massachusetts is represented by Pocahontas,"" he said, referring to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who allegedly faked Native American heritage to advance her legal academic career.""You can have Pocahontas. I'll take Tom Brady and Bill Belichick,"" he said, to cheers.Trump took command of the Republican primary with a win in New Hampshire in February. On Oct. 28, Trump had been in New Hampshire when the FBI announced that it was re-opening its investigation into Hillary Cliinton's email server. The news sent a jolt of electricity through the campaign, and sent the packed crowd in the Armory Ballroom into pandemonium.Trump visited New Hampshire again last week, as polls showed him surging in the state. No Republican presidential candidate has won New Hampshire, and its four Electoral College votes, in several cycles. However, Democrats are spending time in the state, with Hillary Clinton's campaign scheduling several events there in the final week.Ivanka Trump also spoke briefly before her father, marveling at the campaign he had built and telling the audience that the real work would begin tomorrow, on Election Day -- and afterwards.David Gotthardt and his son, Ryan, of Manchester, told Breitbart News that they were impressed with the rally and believed Trump could win New Hampshire.Charlie Watson drove up from Massachusetts for the rally. He said he has been holding up signs at intersections for Trump in his home state, even though Clinton is certain to win that state.""He's a man of his word. He knows what he's doing,"" Watson said.After the rally, Trump sped to the airport -- with throngs of supporters cheering the motorcade in the streets of Manchester -- to head to Michigan to join Pence for the final rally of the campaign, in Grand Rapids.Joel B.

Trump has pledged to preserve that right, to maintain the Second Amendment ""in its strongest form."" But Clinton has vowed to implement numerous new gun controls -- including an ""assault weapons"" ban, a ""high-capacity"" magazine ban, and universal background checks, which, by the way, have already failed to stop terrorists and mass attackers in California, Colorado, Washington state, and Paris.In fact, the WikiLeaks Podesta email release revealed that Clinton plans to use executive action to circumvent Congress and expand background checks so as to abolish private sales at gun shows.Yet Clinton looked voters in the eye during the third presidential debate and said, ""I support the Second Amendment."" In that same debate, she talked about choosing Supreme Court justices who will tweak -- if not reverse -- the ruling in District of Columbia v Heller (2008). That is the ruling in which SCOTUS reaffirmed that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. Clinton openly disagrees with the decision, which makes one wonder how she can both oppose Heller yet support the Second Amendment?The simple answer is that she can't. And all her gun control machinations -- from the afore mentioned ""assault weapons"" ban to her plans to make gun makers and sellers liable for gun crimes -- prove that she will gut the Second Amendment if she gets the chance to hold our nation's highest office.On the other hand, Trump is a concealed carry permit holder, a life member of the NRA, and stands against ""assault weapons"" bans, ""high-capacity"" magazine bans, and any expansion of background checks. Moreover, Trump has been clear that he plans to nominate a Supreme Court justice similar to Antonin Scalia, thereby protecting the Second Amendment and the Heller decision rather than pillaging both.Think about how the two candidates react when a high-profile gun crime occurs. Clinton responded to the San Bernardino and Orlando Pulse attacks by calling for more gun control via an ""assault weapons"" ban and an expansion of background checks that would include terror watch lists. She completely overlooked the fact that neither the San Bernardino attackers nor the Orlando attacker was on a list, so such an expansion would not have hindered them from buying guns in the least. Moreover, she failed to note that both attacks took place in gun-free zones, so the issue was not the kind of gun they used but the fact that innocent people were barred from being armed for self-defense.How did Trump respond to these incidents? In both cases, he stressed that concealed carry could have saved lives, if not prevented the attacks altogether.During a January 10 appearance on Meet the Press, Trump talked about the terror attacks in Paris and the one in San Bernardino, saying:If in Paris or if in California recently, where the fourteen people were killed and probably others to follow-in terms of that group because you have some people who are very, very badly wounded-if in Paris they had guns or if in California [they had guns,] on the other side, where the bullets go both ways, not just in one direction. You wouldn't have had the kind of carnage that you had.The choice is elementary: Do you want a president who will continue President Obama's habit of using every high-profile gun crime as a justification for more gun control and/or all-out bans on certain types of firearms, or do you want a president who sees gun-free zones as a problem, who believes the armed citizen is key in both the fight against crime and against terror? If your position is the latter -- that an armed citizenry is as ""necessary to the security of a free state"" now as it was when the Second Amendment was ratified -- then Trump is your candidate. And November 8 is your day.Vote like your guns depend on it (they do).AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.
