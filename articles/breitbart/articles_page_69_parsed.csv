Thinks we can get >>> something by standing up for Latinos or attacking R's [Republicans] for not condemning,"" Podesta wrote in an email sent out to members of the Clinton team on July 3, 2015.Almost immediately, Jennifer Palmieri, a former White House staffer who now serves as communications director for the Clinton campaign, responded, ""Haim is right - we should be jamming this all the time.""Predictably, Univision's news programs, especially anchor Jorge Ramos, have since characterized Trump's comments as ""anti-immigrant"" every chance they get, putting all Latinos, both legal and illegal, into one box. The Republican candidate was actually referring to illegal immigrants.In the July 3, 2015, email thread about Haim urging the campaign to go after Trump, prominent DREAMer and immigration activist Lorella Praeli , who now serves as the Clinton campaign's Latino Outreach Director, sent out a message of her own, saying:Alex, who works for Haim, called a few minutes ago. Same message- Haim > thinks HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton] needs to be on the forefront of this and show that she's an > integral part of the community, lift up and be proud of the contributions > Latinos make... He asked to call him and share our plan > and get input from them.The Clinton campaign discussed setting up an interview to respond to Trump's comments with only Univision, leaving out its competitor Telemundo, in the same email thread where Univision's chairman told the campaign to go on the offense.Univision's editorial and corporate divisions are separate, Monica Talan, a spokeswoman for the network, argued in an interview with Politico, adding that ""the News division must have complete editorial independence, and it does.""Nevertheless, Tina Flournoy, former President Bill Clinton's chief of staff, revealed in an email to Podesta on March 17, 2015, that Saban arranged for Univision to pay her boss to speak at Univision's upfront presentation for advertisers and the media in May 2015.The arrangement also included a 15-minute ""open press"" interview with Alicia Menendez -- an anchor at Fusion, Univision's joint venture with ABC.Saban -- Clinton's prolific donor who has confessed that to see Hillary assume the presidency is ""a big dream of mine"" and has said he would give her campaign ""as much as is needed"" to defeat her rival Trump -- is in charge of the biggest Spanish-language media network in the U.S. that has major influence on the Latino population of the country.The total 9,000 hacked emails that have been released by WikiLeaks as of October 13 -- sent and received by Clinton Campaign Manager John Podesta -- make Saban appear as an integral part of the Clinton campaign who influences what Univision reports about her.Nevertheless, when Hotair published an article on May 13, 2015, titled, ""The press is starting to notice Univision's pro-Hillary boosterism,"" the network's co-owner wrote to the Clinton campaign nearly three months later in an August 23, 2015, email:I have nothing to do with it. [I] NEVER tell our news dep. What to cover.,,,unlike some of my peers.Saban -- who has been identified as Hillary's biggest financial supporter after donating more than $2 million to support her political campaigns and an additional $10 million-plus to the Clinton Foundation, where his wife sits on the board -- may not be aware of how Mrs. Clinton's camp really feels about Latinos.In an August 21, 2015, email published by WikiLeaks, Podesta refers to Latinos as ""needy"" and calls former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson a ""dick.""Two days after the email was sent, Richardson, doubtless oblivious to Podesta's remarks, endorsed Hillary Clinton, whose trustworthiness remains a drag on her run for president.Richardson was the first Hispanic Democrat to seek the presidency of the United States in 2008, along with Hillary.Univision has yet to mention the August 2015 email, which was posted Wednesday, despite the fact that it berated Latinos and a Latino leader.Although Podesta has suggested some of the emails have been fabricated by Russian hackers, ""the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party have declined to certify the emails' authenticity,"" reports McClatchy DC, later adding, ""But Clinton herself indicated they were authentic when she recalled at Sunday's presidential debate the details of a speech she'd given that was among the emails.""3. Don't have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked...-- John Podesta (@johnpodesta) October 7, 2016Alex, who works for Haim, called a few minutes ago.

""I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything,"" Trump said told a TV host while they were waiting to start recording a show.Mrs. Obama continued:It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted.

Hillary Clinton has been accused of intimidating women who objected to her husband's sexual aggression, and of callously treating a child rape-victim.Before the debate on Sunday, Donald Trump held a news conference with some of the women who had been raped by Bill Clinton. These women each told their story of the abuse that they endured at the hands of Bill Clinton.But Michelle Obama focused her listeners' attention on Trump's activities, not those of the Democratic candidate and the former president.  She said:It's that feeling of terror and violation that too many women have felt when someone has grabbed them, or forced himself on them and they've said no but he didn't listen -- something that we know happens on college campuses and countless other places every single day.

Data reported in several of the fourteen states in which there is some data (Ohio, North Dakota, Kentucky, and Tennessee) is only partial, and in other states (California, and Indiana) covers only the most recent year, rather than the five most recent years.The Minnesota Department of Health provided Breitbart News with this statement when asked why Minnesota has reported ten times more active TB cases among refugees than any of these fourteen other states:The data you are referring to, showing 50% of the 593 foreign born residents of Minnesota diagnosed with TB arrived as refugees, represents years 2010 - 2014. The majority of those refugees actually developed TB disease after being in Minnesota at least five years, and many had been in the US at least 10 years, so these are not new arrivals to the US.The presence of other medical conditions is the chief risk factor for the activation of TB disease in a person with latent infection (and remember, a third of the world has latent TB infection). These conditions include diabetes, cancers, immune suppressing medications, and renal disease. These are conditions common with the American diet and lifestyle, and new risk factors for these refugee populations. Tuberculosis can be treated with antibiotics.Often times the reason that Minnesota reports TB and other infectious diseases at higher rates than other states is because we have a stellar system of surveillance and screening. From 2010 - 2014, in addition to their overseas screening, 99% of our primary refugee arrivals completed an additional health screening within 90-days of their arrival in the US. If you look at national surveillance data in 2014, states with a lower percentage of foreign-born cases arriving as refugees often have a higher percentage of unknown or missing data.During the five years between 2010 and 2014, 732 cases of active TB were diagnosed in Minnesota. Of these, 81 percent, or 593, were foreign-born. Of foreign-born cases, 50 percent, or 296, were refugees, according to ""The Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Minnesota, 2010-2014,"" a report published by the Minnesota Department of Health.Minnesota's 81 percent of TB cases diagnosed among foreign-born residents is significantly higher than the 66 percent of TB cases in the entire country that were diagnosed among foreign-born residents in 2015.As Breitbart News reported previously, one major factor in the sudden increase in the number of reported cases of TB in the United States in 2015 (the first time in 23 years the number of TB cases has increased) is the increase in the foreign-born population as a percentage of the total population during this period of time.Twenty-nine percent of the 593 foreign-born cases of active TB diagnosed in Minnesota, or 161, were attributed to Somali born migrants. Almost all Somali migrants to the United States have arrived under the federal refugee resettlement program. The state of Minnesota's population is 5.5 million. Fox News reports the population of the Somali community in the state of Minnesota is 40,000, according to census data. The Star Tribune, citing ""community leaders,"" reports the Somali population in the state may be as high as 70,000, or about one percent of the state's total population.During the five years between 2010, and 2014, 22 percent of Minnesota's active TB cases (161 out of 732) were diagnosed among the one percent of the state's residents born in Somalia.The remaining 99 percent of the state's population accounted for 78 percent of Minnesota's active TB cases (471 out of 732).At an average cost of $17,000 for each case of successfully treated active TB, taxpayers of Minnesota paid an estimated $5 million to treat the 296 cases of active TB diagnosed among refugees between 2010 and 2014-$3 million for the 161 Somali refugees diagnosed with active TB, and an additional $2 million to treat the 132 refugees diagnosed with active TB who were not born in Somalia.During these five years, 10,128 refugees were resettled in Minnesota, according to the Department of State's interactive website. Of these, 4,163 listed Burma as their country of origin and 3,458 listed Somalia as their country of origin.Dahir Adan, who attacked ten Americans in a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on September 17 before he was shot and killed by an armed off-duty police officer, was a Somali refugee who arrived in North Dakota in the 1990s and subsequently moved to Minnesota, where he was a resident at the time of his death.One particular note of concern from a health perspective is the number of refugees allowed to arrive in Minnesota with a pre-existing TB health classification who developed active TB after arriving in the United States.Refugees diagnosed with active infectious TB receive a Class A TB risk health classification and are not allowed to enter the country unless they receive a waiver from the Department of Homeland Security. Some refugees with a Class A TB diagnosis apparently have received such a waiver, but the Department of Homeland Security has not made public the number of such waivers it has granted.Refugees who receive Class B1, B2, and B3 TB risk classifications in their overseas medical screenings are allowed to enter the United States.The Centers for Disease Control defines Class B1 TB risk classifications for refugees with ""chest radiograph findings that are consistent with tuberculosis infection without positive sputum smear or culture results for tuberculosis,"" and Class B2 TB risk classifications for refugees with ""latent tuberculosis infection.""Of the 71 refugees/immigrants ""diagnosed with TB within one year after arrival to U.S., Minnesota, 2010-2014,"" 17 percent, or 12, arrived with Class B1 TB health risk classifications, and nine percent, or six, arrived with Class B2 TB health risk classifications.Most of the 296 refugees were diagnosed with active TB during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, from January 2009 to February 2013.Placement of refugees in specific states is determined by the Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migrants, in consultation with the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.Though the Refugee Act of 1980 requires that the federal government ""consult with"" state, local, and county governments prior to the placement of refugees in those jurisdictions, that requirement has been largely ignored by the federal government.Breitbart News previously reported that 22 percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota tested positive for latent TB infection at the time of their initial domestic medical screening.Nebraska (21), Louisiana (21), Michigan (19),  Vermont (17), Colorado (16), Florida (11), Ohio (11 in one county), Idaho (7), Kentucky (9 in one county), North Dakota (4 in one county),  Indiana (4), California (3), and Tennessee, where two refugees have been diagnosed with the very dangerous, multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB.The data you are referring to, showing 50% of the 593 foreign born residents of Minnesota diagnosed with TB arrived as refugees, represents years 2010 - 2014.

""The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press.""""Let's be clear on one thing,"" he continued.

""They put other statements that she didn't say. They misrepresented.

It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them. ""I will not allow the Clinton machine to turn our campaign into a discussion based on their slanders and lies.""On a broader note, Trump told attendees Clinton only had the press ""going for herself"" and speculated on what her effort might be without the media.""The only thing Hillary Clinton has going for herself is the press,"" he said. ""Without the press, she is absolutely zero. And you saw that the other night in the debate where some people said she made virtually a fool of herself.

There's a big Trump and a little Trump,"" Gingrich said. ""The little Trump is frankly pathetic. I mean, he's mad over not getting a phone call?""Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo cut across Gingrich and noted--correctly--that Ryan is not giving Trump support ""with 27 days left"" until the election. Ryan, after tapes of Trump making lewd comments about women leaked over last weekend before the debate on Sunday night where Trump rebounded again, aimed to undermine Trump once again.Ryan did not congratulate Trump on winning the debate, and has signaled to Republicans in Congress his intention to abandon the GOP presidential nominee right before the election. He did, however, fall in line behind the Trump campaign's message on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign staff's attacks against Catholic voters as evidenced by WikiLeaks emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Nonetheless, with the exception of that moment, Ryan has been systematically targeting Trump--and ignoring Clinton entirely--on the campaign trail.Gingrich, however, wants Trump to ignore the fact that the entire political establishment--including the mainstream media and even elements of the Republican establishment in Washington, D.C.--have been trying to sabotage his campaign. He wants Trump to focus exclusively on Hillary Clinton, rather than expose the entire system that has bred this political class that's trying to take him down.""Donald Trump has one opponent.

That admission is coupled with the revelation of how exactly--over a months-long period--her campaign staff helped her maneuver through her position change on the explosive issue. And all of that is mixed together with the admission in writing in these emails by her campaign manager Robby Mook that Hillary Clinton would not be ""comfortable"" coming out against TPP during the campaign, even though she had to do it for votes. These emails indicate just how seriously her team of political operatives took the issue--and how they viewed it, as Mook said in one email, as an ""annoying"" issue in terms of timing--in terms of not infuriating labor unions, which by and large oppose such trade deals. Clinton has had a rocky relationship with Big Labor, as other emails have shown her campaign staff's frustration with union bosses like the AFL-CIO's Richard Trumka.Clinton's pollster John Anzalone admitted in the clearest possible language that the goal in manicuring Clinton's newfound position against TPP was for political purposes to get on the side of voters. In one email, Anzalone detailed how it's clear that Clinton would lose an ""integrity gold star"" by not ""staying pure"" in her support of the TPP and the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) that would fast track congressional consideration of TPP and other deals. He also noted that Clinton previously supported the deal in her book Hard Choices, and hinted at the 45 times she previously promoted the deal as reported by CNN. The thinking of coming out against TPP was that it would get Clinton ""right with voters"" and ""right with labor,"" as the general public and labor unions both oppose trade deals like TPP, regardless of her actual position on the deal.""I talked to Marlon [Marshall, Clinton's director of state campaigns and political engagement] today about this,"" Anzalone wrote to Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook on April 13, 2015, around 2:45 p.m. He went on:Naturally we should not be making this decision in a policy vacuum or just because we are concerned about a story of her changing her mind or taking on Obama. It is so much bigger than this. Getting on the wrong side of Labor on the only issue they care about has ramifications on the ground in these early states. I say we suck it up and be as definitive as possible from the beginning that we don't like these deals. We will be right with voters and right with labor. We get no integrity gold star for staying pure on this issue because of one line if friggin Hard Choices or because this is a key issue for a lame duck president.A previous email exchange in March 2015 detailed how Clinton's staff believed she intended to support both TPA and TPP. The email from her lead speechwriter makes it very clear: The draft letter he was circulating ""assumes that she's ultimately going to support both TPA and TPP.""""All, I want to share our draft letter on trade,"" Clinton speechwriter Dan Schwerin wrote to Podesta and Mook among others on the Clinton team. Schwerin continued:As you'll recall, the idea here is to use this to lay out her thinking on TPA & TPP ahead of action on the Hill and a joint letter by all the former Secretaries of State and Defense. This draft assumes that she's ultimately going to support both TPA and TPP. It focuses on what needs to happen to produce a positive result with TPP, and casts support for TPA as one of those steps. It also says that we should walk away if the final agreement doesn't meet the test of creating more jobs than it displaces, helping the middle class, and strengthening our national security. We've tried to speak directly to the most prominent concerns expressed by Labor and Hill Dems, including Warren. Of course, if we go ahead with a meeting with HRC to lay out the pros and cons and then come to a different conclusion, this letter would change dramatically.To set the scene here, at this stage of the game, Congress was soon going to be considering the highly controversial TPA fast track authority. Fast track greases the skids for congressional approval of trade deals, lowering U.S. Senate vote thresholds to 51 votes rather than 60 votes needed to pass them. It also eliminates the ability for Congress to amend trade deals, and forces Congress to consider trade deals in a certain amount of time after the president introduces them onto the fast track. It is widely understood that passing TPA is absolutely necessary to passing any multilateral global trade deal, as no deal would muster 60 votes in the Senate or survive a grueling amendment process where opponents could run out the clock. Killing TPA would have killed TPP, but technically speaking TPP can still be killed--even though it still hasn't been--in a much harder way on the fast track.Congressional passage of TPA last year inspired a surge in populist nationalism that served as the backbone of the presidential campaigns of eventual GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump and of Clinton's primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. From both sides, Clinton--the former Secretary of State, former U.S. Senator and former First Lady who's married to a former president known for backing globalist trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)--has taken incoming on trade policy. The issue nuked the last man standing against Trump in the GOP primaries, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), whose ambivalence was part of what cost him the nomination. And it certainly had the potential to derail Clinton in her battle against Sanders.These emails indicate that her staff understood that Clinton was in favor of TPP. Specifically, in her book Hard Choices--as Anzalone referenced in that April 13, 2015, email--Clinton praised the TPP as beneficial to American workers. Hillary Clinton wrote:One of our most important tools for engaging with Vietnam was a proposed new trade agreement called the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property. As President Obama explained, the goal of TPP negotiations is to establish 'a high standard, enforceable, meaningful trade agreement' that 'is going to be incredibly powerful for American companies who, up until this point, have often been locked out of those markets.' It was also important for American workers who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field. And it was a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia.That was in addition to at least 45 other times she praised and promoted TPP, as reported on June 15, 2015, by CNN's Jake Tapper and his reporting staff. Clinton would not actually officially oppose TPP until October 2015, stating according to CNN in an Oct. 7, 2015 interview with PBS' sJudy Woodruff: ""As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.""That means a months-long internal process eventually led to her coming out against the deal she originally supported and helped negotiate--and concerns as to whether she is truly against it remain. In fact, Trump surrogate and TPP opponent Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) on Thursday morning railed against Clinton on the issue on Breitbart News Daily--saying that if Clinton wins she will ""make a few cosmetic changes, say the thing is fixed, and try to move it [the TPP] through Congress.""""As Secretary of State, she helped write the dadgum thing. So give me a break. She's praised it,"" Sessions said.Mook forwarded that Anzalone email on April 13, 2015, to Podesta around 10 p.m. that evening, saying that he agreed with Anzalone--but that Clinton herself would not be ""comfortable"" locking herself in against TPP.""John articulated my thoughts better than I did...but I know the boss won't be comfortable putting her foot down,"" Mook wrote to Podesta.All of this discussion that day--April 13, 2015--came in response to an email that Clinton's senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan sent shortly after 8 a.m. on the different mechanisms to come out against TPP:For TPA/TPP, we have three options.*1. The Podesta/Jake option leads with supporting giving the President authority but indicating concern with the open-ended grant of authority. Podesta would add a bracketed sentence declaring opposition to the Wyden bill.*I called Senator Wyden. I told him I believe that President Obama should have the authority to negotiate a good TPP deal that delivers for the middle class, but I don't support extending that authority for years beyond this administration and this trade agreement. [And therefore I can't support his bill.]But the key question for me is not the procedure - it's what's in the final agreement. It has to pass two tests: First, does it protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home than it displaces? And second, does it also strengthen our national security? If the agreement falls short of these tests, we should be willing to walk away. The goal is greater prosperity for American families, not trade for trade's sake.There are a number of pivotal questions to be decided in the coming months: from improving labor rights, the environment, public health, and access to life-saving medicines; to cracking down on currency manipulation and unfair competition by state-owned enterprises; to opening new opportunities for our family farms and small businesses to export their products and services overseas. Getting these things right will go a long way toward ensuring that a final agreement will be a net plus for everyday Americans.We also have to get dispute settlement provisions right. So-called ""investor-state dispute settlement,"" or ISDS, lets individual companies bring cases to enforce trade agreements. In the past, ISDS has benefited some American companies by letting them challenge unfair actions by foreign governments. But as I warned in my book, *Hard Choices*, we shouldn't allow multinational corporations to use ISDS to undermine legitimate health, social, economic, and environmental regulations, as Philip Morris has tried to do in Australia.So I'll be watching closely to see how negotiations develop.*2. The Jen P. option would lead with TPP and then come to procedure.*The key question for me is not the procedure - it's what's in the final agreement. It has to pass two tests: First, does it protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home than it displaces? And second, does it also strengthen our national security? If the agreement falls short of these tests, we should be willing to walk away. The goal is greater prosperity for American families, not trade for trade's sake.As for process, I called Senator Wyden. I told him I believe that President Obama should have the authority to negotiate a good TPP deal that delivers for the middle class, but I don't support extending that authority for years beyond this administration and this trade agreement. [And therefore I can't support his bill.]*3. The Robby option would lean more heavily and decisively against TPA and TPP.*I called Senator Wyden. I told him I can't support his bill. I don't support a broad grant of trade authority that extends for years beyond this administration and this trade agreement. I think this President should have the authority to drive a hard bargain on TPP, but this broader bill doesn't work from my perspective.As for TPP, I'm going to set a very high bar. It has to pass two tests: First, does it protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home than it displaces? And second, does it also strengthen our national security? If the agreement falls short of these tests, we should be willing to walk away. The goal is greater prosperity for American families, not trade for trade's sake.In response to Sullivan's email, Anzalone wrote that he favored quote number three--Mook's approach. And in his email, he noted that Clinton may face ""historical blowback on her past position"" due to her flip-flopping on TPP.Anzalone wrote in an email that included Sullivan, Podesta, Jennifer Palmieri, Mook, Joel Benenson, Mandy Grunwald, Jim Margolis, Dan Schwerin, Kristina Schake, Marlon Marshall, and Amanda Renteria:I am for three because it sends the strongest signal not only Labor but to where voters are on trade. They feel they always get the raw end of the deal. I am less concerned about historical blowback on her past position than this issue eating us alive for being on the wrong side and giving Progressives a real reason to try and push someone more weighty into the primary. There are no other issues that Labor cares about. This is it for them and they actually have voters on their side.Margolis replied that he supported a mix of options two and three.""I'm for principle first, process second,"" Margolis wrote. ""So I'd go Jen, with the harder hit at the end from Robby. Closing with 'I called Senator Wyden. I told him I can't support his bill.""Mook greenlighted the Margolis plan, writing ""I'm good with Margolis' plan"" before a discussion ensued--initiated by Benenson--about how Hillary Clinton was having trouble with labor unions.""We clearly need a bigger strategic discussion about how to deal with labor as a constituency,"" Benenson wrote.Mook assured the team that was under way, as Renteria and Marshall were heading up an effort to do just that. ""Marlon and Amanda are putting together a plan to reach out quickly whenever she steps out on this to frame for them on our terms,"" he replied.Back on March 25, 2015, Schwerin circulated that internal draft letter on trade policy that assumed she would support TPP and TPA.March 25 Letter by Breitbart News on ScribdLater, on April 5, 2015, eight days before this effort to begin coming out against TPP slightly--a process that would take until at least October and to some is still ongoing--the Clinton team revised her position, circulating a new letter on trade that included her opposing ISDS, or Investor State Dispute Settlement, a hot-button issue for unions. The email chain was discussing how Congress was soon going to be considering TPA.In that April 5 email chain, Mook specifically noted he was worried that unions would be shaming Clinton off the bat in her campaign.""The timing is so annoying,"" Mook wrote of congressional TPA consideration. ""Steps right on launch. Would be a shame to have labor booing her right out of the gate.""Along with the April 5 chain there were two separate revisions to the draft trade letters that were circulated--one on April 5 and another on April 6.April 5 Letter by Breitbart News on ScribdApril 6 Letter by Breitbart News on Scribd
Before getting to that April 13 point where they seem to eventually start shifting against TPP and TPA, another leaked email chain from April 11 indicates that the Clinton campaign staffers were still hand wringing--searching for a way to get to a ""pure dodge"" in the media.At 2:09 a.m, on April 11, Jake Sullivan circulated draft remarks from Clinton he pitched as the ""Podesta approach"" on trade:Look, I'm focused on the final deal, and whether it will measure up. If it does, I'll support it. If it doesn't, I won't.TPA is about Senate procedure - and in any event it's just a draft proposal making its way through a Senate committee. I want to focus on the substance: will TPP be a good deal, or not? We haven't seen the details so we can't answer that question yet.Let me say this about TPA. I believe that President Obama should have the negotiating authority to conclude a transpacific agreement that works for the American middle class and advances American leadership. But I don't believe we should give an open-ended fast track to the next president. I hope I'm the next president, and I think I should have to justify fast track to the new Congress. And if a Republican is the next president, I certainly don't want to give fast track to them now - heck, that's why I voted against fast track for President Bush.These are all procedural issues. The key for me is whether the final deal passes two tests: pass two tests: First, does it raise wages and create more good jobs at home than it displaces? And second, does it also strengthen our national security? Let's wait and see that final deal.At 6:28 a.m., Palmieri wrote back saying that she was looking for more of a ""dodge"" than what Sullivan pitched:Boo!My impression of the Podesta approach was more of a dodge then what you have here.For example, if she weighs in on length of the TPA I think that will be viewed as passive opposition. Now what you propose would be more popular with dems and labor and closer to her view - so maybe okay, just want to consider that dynamic.Think this is worth getting on the phone today to discuss.At 6:53 a.m., Sullivan responded that what he pitched was something that would be ""sustainable"" if the campaign couldn't get away with a ""pure dodge"":This is a alternative if we can't do pure dodge. Which I don't think we can.It says, I want him to have negotiating authority but not republicans. I've never supported republicans getting negotiating authority. (And if I'm elected I'm prepared to make my own case.). So what about Wyden hatch? I don't like that part but my real focus the final deal.This feels more sustainable than full dodge.Let's do call later today?By 9:33 a.m. that day, Mook was pushing for another campaign call.Naturally we should not be making this decision in a policy vacuum or just because we are concerned about a story of her changing her mind or taking on Obama. It is so much bigger than this. Getting on the wrong side of Labor on the only issue they care about has ramifications on the ground in these early states.

""That may not be statutory bribery but that is certainly absolutely honest services fraud, without question.""""Anybody who looks at that and says, 'Well, that's perfectly okay' is either lying because they're trying to support Hillary, hypocritical or they just don't understand what's going on in Washington,"" Abramoff added.Abramoff served four years out of a six year prison sentence for conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe first Sept. 9 email complaint came from policy advisor Ann O'Leary, following a TV interview of AFL-CIO president Trumka, in which he seemed to favor Biden over Hillary Clinton. Hillary is dubbed ""HRC"" in the email, and Trumka's name is misspelled.This Trumpka [sic] line about Joe Biden really annoys me whenever I hear him say it - that Biden has been fighting for working people his whole life. It implies that HRC has not. Is there anything we can do to get him to add something nice about HRC? If he says it and then says HRC has too - or gives an example of her fighting for the first responders after 9/11 or something, I think it will help the perception that there is a labor record contrast between the two.Three hours later, O'Leary got a reply from Nikki Budzinski, the labor outreach director at the Clinton campaign. I agree. He is annoying. I'd like to just call the AFLCIO and talk to Mike Podhorzer about this. Let me know if anyone disagrees.Podhorzer is the political director at the AFL-CIO, but is also a major player in various progressive research groups. These complaints about Trumka came before Biden said he would not compete for the nomination against Clinton.Eventually, the AFl-CIO tepidly endorsed Clinton in June 2016, long after she had locked up the Democratic Party's primary race with her primary win in California -- but also after the Democratic grassroots had forced Clinton to conditionally back away from the wage-cutting Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. The AFL-CIO's June 16 announcement said:""Hillary Clinton is a proven leader who shares our values,"" said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. ""Throughout the campaign, she has demonstrated a strong commitment to the issues that matter to working people, and our members have taken notice. The activism of working people has already been a major force in this election and is now poised to elect Hillary Clinton and move America forward.""The gap between Clinton's team and the AFL-CIO does show the widening gap between the party's blue-collar supporters and the dominant faction of university-education progressives. The upper-income tend to favor increased immigration of wage-cutting workers and a greater focus on social issues, such as greater status for upper-income feminists or sexual minorities.That political gap is open in the national election, where Donald Trump is trying to win support from blue-collar voters and union members with a pro-American pitch that would curb free-trade and reduce large-scale, wage-cutting immigration. In January 2016, the president of the SEIU union admitted that many members of her huge union would support Trump.""I am deeply concerned about what is stirring, even in our membership... where our members are responding to Trump's message,"" said Mary Kay Henry, the international president of the Service Employees International Union. ""Sixty-four percent of our public members identify as conservative, and are much more interested in the Republican debate than the Democratic debate at the moment,"" she told David Axelrod, the chief campaign strategist for President Barack Obama's election in 2008.Before the ""annoying"" email, the AFL-CIO was pushing Clinton's upper-income progressive faction to pay more attention to union members' economic and security priorities. An April 15 statement by the union said:We call on all of America's working men and women--Democrat and Republican, white collar, blue collar and no collar--to join us in supporting the candidate who can and will deliver on the American Promise. That is the standard. We will not settle for less ... That also means no candidate can be all things to all people and still meet this standard. Standing with working people once in a while won't work. Candidates can't hedge bets any longer ... The growing political power of the wealthiest among us has rewritten our labor laws, our trade laws, our tax laws, our monetary policies, our fiscal policies, our financial regulations ...We want earned sick leave. We want full employment and fair overtime rules. We want to tax Wall Street to pay for massive investments in infrastructure and education, so Wall Street serves Main street, not the other way around ... we want to be able to bargain collectively with our employers for good wages and benefits without fear of retaliation.The pressure worked, at  least partly. Clinton has edged away from her support for TPP, and in November 2015, two months after the ""annoying"" email, Clinton's team announced a proposal to spend $30 billion in aid on coal-mining communities that are being shut down by the party's environmentalist wing. Another hacked email to John Podesta described Trumka's thankful reaction for the plan: President Trumka's office just called me to see if you could talk. When you weren't around to jump on the phone he got on the line and delivered this message to me to give to you: He would like to give a huge thank you to YOU and HRC for the $30 billion dollar aid plan to ensure that coal miners and their families get the benefits they've earned and respect they deserve. He said it shows a great sensitivity for these issues that no other politician in this country is showing right now. Trumka began his union career in the coal-mining union.  
This Trumpka [sic] line about Joe Biden really annoys me whenever I hear him say it - that Biden has been fighting for working people his whole life. It implies that HRC has not. Is there anything we can do to get him to add something nice about HRC?

Feingold jumps in and says, ""Well, there might be executive order.""O'Keefe responds by acting like he was learning this for the first time. In a surprised voice, he saus, ""Oh, so she can...I know that President Obama..."" Feingold then takes over the conversation, saying, ""He did some executive orders with the aspects of waiting periods. But what we all need is to win the Senate, have her there, and then put pressure on the House. And we might win the House.""O'Keefe also spoke with Amy Rao, Clinton's friend and host of the fundraiser. On hidden camera video, Rao says, ""Hillary wants to shut it down. She wants to shut it down,"" referring to guns.Rao continued: ""If we can get guns away from everyone in this country, she'll close the loopholes, get rid of assault weapons. She'll get rid of being able to buy, you know, unlimited bullets. She's going to make all that stop."" On October 7, Breitbart News reported that Wikileaks released an email from Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon, wherein he made it clear she plans to use executive orders to secure control. The email was dated October 4, 2015.

There will be no university-style ""safe spaces"" at polling places this year.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNo one cares about your feelings. What we'll give the 2016 candidates on November 8th is our vote--not our opinions, not our emotions and certainly not our endorsements. Most don't deserve that.Your vote is not an endorsement. This isn't about your emotions. It's about your future. It is a choice for the strategic and practical direction of your country.The process for choosing our nation's leaders has become less about vision and viability and more about personalities. ""Likability"" is now the determining factor for electability. However, the 2016 election cannot digress into a popularity contest. There is too much at stake.We should choose a leader that prioritizes directness, not weakness--who cherishes authenticity, not duplicity.The American people must vote for capability, not likability.A sensationalist's dream. It was a weekend for the proverbial history books: ""scandalous"" Trump tapes from 2005, a damning document dump by WikiLeaks on Hillary Clinton, and the second presidential debate.As for the debate, Trump handily beat Hillary in the town-hall style forum with a better understanding of reality and a commanding, authentic and presidential tone.The most historic moment of the night? Responding to Hillary's attack that she's thankful her opponent isn't (yet) running the country, Trump said, ""Yeah, because you'd be in jail.""A pay-per-view MMA round couldn't have packed this much punch.But with 27 days till the election, we continue to hear groaning over the poor candidate matchup. Cries for a third-party option have come from friends leaning left and right. Are we the only ones remembering the near-record voter turnout that delivered these two candidates?Groaning aside, it's time to RSVP for November 8th. It's time to vote. Sure, at this election dinner table, you could ignore the options of chicken or fish and write in vegetarian. You'll feel good about your choice, but you're still eating chicken or fish.In 2012, one out of every 20 Christian voters stayed home protesting Mormon presidential candidate, Mitt Romney. Four years later, we have a deja vu of principled voters throwing the election and their vote away.Sit home or vote, either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be your president.Let's try a different approach.You're electing a President, not a friend or a pastor.Mainstream comedian, Lewis Black, explains candidly that if you could see yourself having a beer with one of the candidates, vote for the other person.Picking a president because he or she is a nice person is absurd--not to mention irresponsible. That would be like stacking your fantasy football team with the nicest guys in the league instead of the best, most strategic players. Ask Tim Tebow how well that worked out.Trump and Clinton may not perfectly align with your moral convictions, but a strategic vote means electing a Commander-in-Chief who aligns with at least some of them. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was an obese, womanizing drunk well known for his terse remarks and offensive gestures.However, his personality and stubbornness was perfectly tailored to leading Great Britain to victory in World War II--which President Obama may have forgotten since he removed the Churchill bust from the Oval Office.The man who told us, ""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for you country,"" was the same man who was recorded saying, ""If I don't have a woman for three days, I get a terrible headache.""John F. Kennedy is buried in Arlington Cemetery and the nation burns an eternal flame in his honor. Without him, we may have never landed on the moon, nor reached for the stars.We are imperfect people choosing imperfect leaders to run an imperfect nation.Make a strategic choice. We're not taught to vote smart. We have been conditioned to vote based on feelings and reaction, rather than preemptive action.As Americans, voting should be the most practical choice we make. You will never see a candidate on the ballot that perfectly represents your principles and priorities.Each election represents a step towards the end zone. Whether it was Civil Rights reform or women's suffrage, social change happens over time--as does the downfall of a society.We make practical decisions everyday. For example, most Apple iPhone users gobbled up the recent iPhone 7 despite widespread reports of declining work conditions for Chinese factory workers.Users continue to overlook their personal objections because functional technology outweighs their social concern.Elections are no different. We decide to align with candidates despite knowing the dirty underbelly of the system. We recognize that there are reasons for disagreement and even disgust.We should never discount character. In fact, it is an essential quality in a president. The ability to make just, moral decisions during our country's darkest hours determine America's destiny. So what do we do in 2016?  The elites have confused self-righteousness with being right.More than 100 establishment Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, pulled their support for Trump at the revelation of his 2005 statements. Don't be fooled by their press statements. This isn't about their principles and it isn't about the Constitution. To them, there's one thing that matters more than the Constitution.Getting reelected.Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University and son of Jerry Falwell Sr. said, ""I just think some of the ... establishment folks who reluctantly endorsed [Trump] had this planned all along as a way to slither out of the endorsement, and I think it backfired on them, and I'm glad to see that.""For the Republican elites, it's power first, principles second.Given the choice before us, Hillary is not the most practical, strategic vote for America. She's a step backwards for our economy, an active threat to our safety and security, and an enemy to our Constitutional rights. Hillary failed to even mention the Constitution in the last debate when discussing Supreme Court nominees.Trump, however, is the most practical move for the future of America. He's the only candidate who is concrete on core issues. With priorities like decreasing the debt, appointing Constitution-focused Supreme Court justices, strengthening our southern border, destroying ISIS and ridding the nation of destructive political correctness, Trump lives in reality.Donald Trump is the Republican nominee because America is tired of the elites. Let's put aside the feelings of today, and think about our nation two, five, and 10 years down the road.Trump is the practical vote and a real first down for principles.Brian Bosche is a former national journalist and #1 bestselling author of the book, 13 Reasons to Give a Damn in 2016.

17	17	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/13/the-most-explosive-wikileaks-clinton-revelations-so-far/	The Most Explosive WikiLeaks Clinton Revelations (So Far)	"Here is a rundown of some of the biggest bombshells dropped by WikiLeaks' disclosure of Hillary Clinton's speeches and emails, and why each is so important.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER1. Clinton dreams of a world with ""open trade and open borders"": Every American should understand that Democrats, and plenty of Republicans, are fighting an all-out war against national sovereignty. Sure, Democrats want new voters, and Republican interests want cheap labor, but they also share a mutual desire to increase the distance between the Ruling Class and voters. In the globalist future, political and business titans will stand atop the world, without having to worry about fulfilling annoying duties to grubby little voters with nostalgic memories of the days when American politicians served America's interests. Globalism means you'll never be able to vote against anything.2. Clinton courted business elites to support liberal agenda to beat back populism: Clinton's speeches include numerous examples of something that's hardly new, or unique to her, but a very important harbinger of things to come if she gets into the White House. Democrats serve their voters a steady stream of anti-business, anti-wealth rhetoric, but they're keenly interested in using Big Business to promote the agenda of Big Government. Some of the examples in the leaked speeches, such as Clinton urging business interests to beat back the Tea Party and support open-borders immigration, are points of common interest with the GOP Establishment.3. Clinton campaign coordinated with Super PAC: No one familiar with the WikiLeaks disclosures should be able to restrain their laughter when Hillary Clinton talks about getting ""big money"" and ""dark money"" out of politics. Then again, she should have been laughed off the stage for such tirades long before WikiLeaks started releasing her campaign's emails.4. Clinton admitted she has different ""public and private positions"" on Wall Street reform: Again, this shouldn't surprise anyone, but it's always useful to catch a politician actually admitting she isn't honest with the public on issues - especially an issue of keen interest to the Democrats who opposed her in the primary. In the same issue, she admitted she's out of touch with ordinary Americans and ""far removed"" from middle-class life, which is a refreshing bit of (unintended) candor from such a sanctimonious candidate and Party. Lastly, she said it was an ""oversimplification"" to blame banks for the 2008 financial meltdown, which is true - and greatly understating the truth of Democrat politicians' culpability, at that - but not at all what Democrat hyper-partisans want to hear from their leaders.5. Clinton campaign asked about using White House executive privilege to hide emails from Congress: ""Think we should hold emails to and from POTUS? That's the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that,"" John Podesta - current Clinton campaign chair, and former White House counsel - wrote to Hillary's aide Cheryl Mills, even as the House Benghazi Committee was writing a subpoena for Clinton's long-hidden correspondence. It's absolutely shocking that Team Clinton would think Barack Obama was willing to abuse executive privilege to hide vital information from Congress. Wherever did they get that outrageous idea?6. Clinton campaign looked for political support from ""needy Latinos"": This is the perfect example of an email chain that would set the media on fire, if it came from a Republican political campaign. They seem to have been talking about Latino politicians who were needy, rather than herds of Latino voters, but they were colorfully insulting to some of those politicians. 7. Collusion with State Department on managing Clinton's email scandal: It's pretty clear from these emails that Clinton's team knew she broke the law, but they were (justifiably) confident they could trump the rule of law with politics... and plenty of help from their good friends in the Obama Administration. Other emails illustrate the Clinton team's conviction that all Democrat scandals can be overcome with distractions and delaying tactics, counting on that 90% Democrat media to be easily distracted, and to stay quiet while stonewalls are constructed. You will see more collusion and stonewalling in future Democrat Administrations, building on the precedents Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton established. The next Republican Administration that tries it will get a swift and brutal lesson in why scandal management only works when the administrative state and media support the party in power.8. ""Journalists"" secretly working as enthusiastic volunteers for Clinton/Kaine 2016: Another one to file under ""no big surprise, but still nice to see it on paper."" The American public needs to understand there is no real division between the government and media when a Democrat is in the White House, especially with this particular Democrat. The press loved Barack Obama and was childishly easy for him to spin at will, even during the queasy Fifty Shades of Grey stages of their romantic relationship, but the press is Hillary Clinton's campaign. They're her donors, Clinton Foundation contributors, and often her former (and future!) employees. If you didn't think the media could be less interested in holding a president accountable than Obama, you're in for a shock if Clinton wins.9. Planting the ""seeds of revolution"" in the ""Middle Ages dictatorship"" of the Catholic Church: Democrats view Christians in almost exactly the terms they adamantly refuse to apply to Islamic supremacists. They're also very determined to infiltrate institutions that resist liberalism, subverting them from within, and destroying them if they refuse to be subverted. Check out the latest news about the National Football League for another example.10. Clinton Cash panicked the campaign: They knew how bad this stuff was, and they wasted no time devising strategies to spin it away. They didn't have much trouble convincing the press to stop bugging Clinton about the galaxy of Clinton Foundation scandals, did they? With Republicans, the media works hard to set up denials that look uncomfortable, or which they think can be demolished by later revelations. With Democrats, not so much.11. Flip-flopping on TPP: It's amazing than a single Sanders voter ever believed Clinton was honest about opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but evidently most of them did, or else they never really cared about the issue as much as they claimed to. Leaked emails reveal how Clinton was not ""comfortable"" with attacking the trade deal she once gushed over as the ""gold standard"" for such agreements, but she knew she had to pretend to oppose it to placate union bosses and woo the Sanderistas. Clinton campaign staff talked about her ""integrity"" as though it were a stack of poker chips, deeming it reasonable to sacrifice a little integrity to keep the Sanders insurrection under control.12. Gun control: cherry-picked data and executive orders: Democrats are going to lose patience with voter opposition to their gun control agenda and begin imposing it, as soon as they no longer have to worry about losing a tough election in the near future. They often worry about the potential backlash from Democrat voters in key states who support gun rights, but they'll stop worrying about that soon, especially if Clinton does extremely well in those states. A packed Supreme Court will make her even bolder about chipping away at the Second Amendment. No one should be surprised that Democrats like to pick and choose which crimes the public should focus upon, in order to sell the gun control agenda.13. Special favors for ""Friends of Bill"" in Haiti: The Clintons' use of Haiti as a cash machine was disgusting. The hypocrisy of liberals willing to ignore this carnival of corruption, at the expense of an impoverished black nation, to slip the Clintons back into the White House is unbearable. The corruption of the State Department into a wholly owned subsidiary of Clinton, Inc. should be completely unacceptable.14. Iran nuclear deal was ""greatest appeasement since Chamberlain gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler"": This email chain quotes Republican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois saying Obama's nuclear deal ""condemns the next generation to cleaning up a nuclear war in the Persian Gulf,"" and Clinton campaign chief John Podesta responding, ""Yup."" While the Democrats figure out how to spin that away, the rest of us can reflect that Clinton, Podesta, and other old hands in her inner circle probably have significant differences of opinion with Barack Obama and his teenage-punk approach to foreign policy. Obama and his weird little gang of young advisers thought it would be a great idea to do the opposite of everything his predecessors did, Republican and Democrat alike. The Clinton group worked in one of those preceding Administrations. However, Mrs. Clinton and all of her loyal retainers were willing to stifle their objections to Obama's foreign policy in the name of party loyalty... even when those objections hinted at a future nuclear war.15. Clinton wanted to run against Donald Trump in 2016: The three Republican candidates Clinton's campaign thought they had the best chance of beating were Trump, Ben Carson, and Senator Ted Cruz. ""We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to them seriously,"" said a memo sent to the Democratic National Committee. They were quite confident of their ability to tell the press which Republican candidates it should take seriously.16. Clinton knew Libya was a disaster: Her hindsight about the bloody, world-destabilizing fallout from the overthrow of Qaddafi, and the inability of the new Libyan government to provide security for Americans, was 20/20... but what good does that do anyone, especially the Americans who died in Benghazi? It's laughable to hear Clinton and her supporters brag about her great resume. Her resume is the world outside your window, and what she says about it to her big donors is very different from what she says to the general public.17. ""Foreign govt donors: all the money is in"": The Clinton team is much more relaxed about discussing big bucks from overseas among themselves. They don't want the public thinking about how much support Clinton gets from foreign interests, or dwelling on how unsavory some of those interests are. They were reluctant to disclose all of those foreign donors to the Obama Administration as they promised. But the leaked emails show they're very well aware of how important that imported cash is. This particular email seems to concern locking down foreign financial support for the Clinton Foundation, in case Mrs. and Mr. Clinton find themselves back in the White House next year.18. Clinton Foundation audit reveals it may have misled the IRS: One of the perks of Clintonhood is that you can file taxes incorrectly, suffer no penalties whatsoever, and refile the paperwork years later. A 2011 audit of the Clinton Foundation requested by Chelsea Clinton discovered that, despite sworn statements to the IRS, the Foundation didn't write or enforce the required conflict-of-interest policy... and, wouldn't you know it, some conflicts of interest do seem to have cropped up! Two years later, long after Hillary Clinton resigned as Secretary of State, gift acceptance policies were still a work in progress.SIGN UPHere is a rundown of some of the biggest bombshells dropped by WikiLeaks' disclosure of Hillary Clinton's speeches and emails, and why each is so important.Clinton's speeches include numerous examples of something that's hardly new, or unique to her, but a very important harbinger of things to come if she gets into the White House. Democrats serve their voters a steady stream of anti-business, anti-wealth rhetoric, but they're keenly interested in using Big Business to promote the agenda of Big Government. Some of the examples in the leaked speeches, such as Clinton urging business interests to beat back the Tea Party and support open-borders immigration, are points of common interest with the GOP Establishment.No one familiar with the WikiLeaks disclosures should be able to restrain their laughter when Hillary Clinton talks about getting ""big money"" and ""dark money"" out of politics. Then again, she should have been laughed off the stage for such tirades long before WikiLeaks started releasing her campaign's emails.Again, this shouldn't surprise anyone, but it's always useful to catch a politician actually admitting she isn't honest with the public on issues - especially an issue of keen interest to the Democrats who opposed her in the primary. In the same issue, she admitted she's out of touch with ordinary Americans and ""far removed"" from middle-class life, which is a refreshing bit of (unintended) candor from such a sanctimonious candidate and Party. Lastly, she said it was an ""oversimplification"" to blame banks for the 2008 financial meltdown, which is true - and greatly understating the truth of Democrat politicians' culpability, at that - but not at all what Democrat hyper-partisans want to hear from their leaders. This is the perfect example of an email chain that would set the media on fire, if it came from a Republican political campaign. They seem to have been talking about Latino politicians who were needy, rather than herds of Latino voters, but they were colorfully insulting to some of those politicians. It's pretty clear from these emails that Clinton's team knew she broke the law, but they were (justifiably) confident they could trump the rule of law with politics... and plenty of help from their good friends in the Obama Administration. Other emails illustrate the Clinton team's conviction that all Democrat scandals can be overcome with distractions and delaying tactics, counting on that 90% Democrat media to be easily distracted, and to stay quiet while stonewalls are constructed. You will see more collusion and stonewalling in future Democrat Administrations, building on the precedents Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton established. The next Republican Administration that tries it will get a swift and brutal lesson in why scandal management only works when the administrative state and media support the party in power.Another one to file under ""no big surprise, but still nice to see it on paper."" The American public needs to understand there is no real division between the government and media when a Democrat is in the White House, especially with this particular Democrat. The press loved Barack Obama and was childishly easy for him to spin at will, even during the queasy Fifty Shades of Grey stages of their romantic relationship, but the press is Hillary Clinton's campaign. They're her donors, Clinton Foundation contributors, and often her former (and future!) employees. If you didn't think the media could be less interested in holding a president accountable than Obama, you're in for a shock if Clinton wins. Democrats view Christians in almost exactly the terms they adamantly refuse to apply to Islamic supremacists. They're also very determined to infiltrate institutions that resist liberalism, subverting them from within, and destroying them if they refuse to be subverted. Check out the latest news about the National Football League for another example.They knew how bad this stuff was, and they wasted no time devising strategies to spin it away. They didn't have much trouble convincing the press to stop bugging Clinton about the galaxy of Clinton Foundation scandals, did they? With Republicans, the media works hard to set up denials that look uncomfortable, or which they think can be demolished by later revelations. With Democrats, not so much. Democrats are going to lose patience with voter opposition to their gun control agenda and begin imposing it, as soon as they no longer have to worry about losing a tough election in the near future. They often worry about the potential backlash from Democrat voters in key states who support gun rights, but they'll stop worrying about that soon, especially if Clinton does extremely well in those states. A packed Supreme Court will make her even bolder about chipping away at the Second Amendment. No one should be surprised that Democrats like to pick and choose which crimes the public should focus upon, in order to sell the gun control agenda.The Clintons' use of Haiti as a cash machine was disgusting. The hypocrisy of liberals willing to ignore this carnival of corruption, at the expense of an impoverished black nation, to slip the Clintons back into the White House is unbearable. The corruption of the State Department into a wholly owned subsidiary of Clinton, Inc. should be completely unacceptable.This email chain quotes Republican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois saying Obama's nuclear deal ""condemns the next generation to cleaning up a nuclear war in the Persian Gulf,"" and Clinton campaign chief John Podesta responding, ""Yup."" While the Democrats figure out how to spin that away, the rest of us can reflect that Clinton, Podesta, and other old hands in her inner circle probably have significant differences of opinion with Barack Obama and his teenage-punk approach to foreign policy. Obama and his weird little gang of young advisers thought it would be a great idea to do the opposite of everything his predecessors did, Republican and Democrat alike. The Clinton group worked in one of those preceding Administrations. However, Mrs. Clinton and all of her loyal retainers were willing to stifle their objections to Obama's foreign policy in the name of party loyalty... even when those objections hinted at a future nuclear war."

The Register reports the DA's office says DaVinci charged ""marked-up prices for shipping and processing"" as well.The report continues:According to the lawsuit, the companies hired sales and marketing staffers and pushed them to meet revenue goals through discount promotions such as ""summer sales"" and coupons; the products were advertised in catalogs, brochures and other materials.""It costs us roughly $25 per unit to manufacture, and we are selling from $170,"" one employee wrote in an email, according to the lawsuit.From 2009 to 2015, the companies collected $56,678 in ""packing and handling"" fees marked up by roughly 50 percent over the actual cost of packaging and handling, according to the suit.Employees were paid a commission on profits they earned from the packing and handling charges, the lawsuit says.Some products were allegedly sold to different customers at different prices.""This case is not about whether it should be lawful to sell fetal parts, or whether fetal-tissue research is ethical or legal,"" said district attorney Tony Rackauckas. ""This lawsuit is aimed at taking the profit out of selling body parts.""Michael Tein, attorney for the DaVinci companies, said his clients have complied with regulations regarding fetal tissue and never made money off its sale.""Their scientists worked day and night to discover cell-based medical treatments and improve the quality of life for patients suffering from cancer, Alzheimer's and other deadly diseases,"" he said, according to the Register.DaVinci Biosciences is owned by three members of the Isaias family - Andres, Luis, and Estefano. Two of them also own DV Biologics.The lawsuit comes following a year of congressional investigation into allegations that Planned Parenthood sold aborted fetal tissue and organs to biomedical companies for profit.While some of the focus of the allegations brought by pro-life organization Center for Medical Progress (CMP) has been on Planned Parenthood's relationship with tissue procurement company StemExpress, lead investigator at CMP David Daleiden alleged in a statement that Planned Parenthood of Orange & San Bernardino Counties' (PPOSBC) is ""longtime baby body parts business partners"" with ""sister companies DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics.""""For eight years, Planned Parenthood supplied aborted baby hearts, lungs, brains, and intestines to DV Biologics, which DV Biologics then resold for profit,"" Daleiden continued. ""In exchange for merely providing access to aborted baby body parts, Planned Parenthood received kickback contributions from DaVinci Biosciences over the course of their eight-year contract.""He added:The wheels of justice are beginning to turn against Planned Parenthood and their corrupt business partners in the illicit trade in aborted baby body parts. Planned Parenthood is not above the law, and law enforcement and elected representatives everywhere must now hold Planned Parenthood accountable for their barbaric profiteering off of pregnant women and the body parts of their aborted children.Deputy district attorney Kelly Ernby said the DaVinci companies previously had a contract with Planned Parenthood, but that the taxpayer-funded group is not part of the current investigation.The House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives voted in September to hold biomedical company StemExpress in contempt for failing to provide documents required by congressional subpoena.The panel's chairman, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), issued the following statement regarding the criminal lawsuit against the DaVinci companies:For nearly a year, critics of this Panel's fact-finding investigation have repeatedly called for it to be disbanded, saying there's nothing to see here. They claimed there was no wrongdoing in the fetal tissue industry. This claim was soundly debunked with a lawsuit filed by Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, which reveals that officials at the state and local level share our concern that some fetal tissue middlemen may have broken the law.Documents produced to the Panel show that, from 2008 through 2015, DaVinci Biosciences obtained its fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties (PPOSBC). DaVinci has told the Panel that PPOSBC ""donated"" the fetal tissue. But DaVinci has also told the Panel that its executives contributed thousands of dollars to PPOSBC starting before the Planned Parenthood affiliate began ""donating"" fetal tissue to DaVinci. Planned Parenthood has said PPOSBC was its only affiliate that gave fetal tissue directly to a research company.Blackburn said the panel's investigation shows the relationship between Planned Parenthood and DaVinci ""appears to have created a market for the donation of human fetal tissue.""""As a result, our Panel is continuing to look at connections between Planned Parenthood and tissue procurement companies,"" she said.Pro-life leaders commended the Orange County DA's office for bringing the lawsuit.""For eight years, Planned Parenthood partnered with DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics in their grisly scheme to harvest and traffick the body parts of the babies Planned Parenthood aborted,"" said Lila Rose, president of pro-life organization Live Action, in a statement. She added:I commend the Orange County district attorney, and I hope this sets a precedent for prosecutors and law enforcement across the nation. Abortion is a barbaric and cruel practice, and it should come as no surprise that those callous enough to profit off killing defenseless children in the womb would allegedly profit off selling their organs piecemeal. It's time to end these grave human rights abuses against our most vulnerable children and bring those responsible to justice.Similarly, Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said, ""The Orange County, California District Attorney should be commended for suing two of Planned Parenthood's business partners, DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, for profiting off of the body parts of aborted babies, sold to them by Planned Parenthood.""""Hopefully this lawsuit is the beginning of the unraveling of the entire for-profit fetal tissue industry, one that Planned Parenthood has played a key role in for years,"" Hawkins added. ""If a California District Attorney can file suit for illegally profiting off of baby body parts, there's no excuse for law enforcement in other parts of the country not to do their jobs and put a stop to this criminal activity.""According to the lawsuit, the companies hired sales and marketing staffers and pushed them to meet revenue goals through discount promotions such as ""summer sales"" and coupons; the products were advertised in catalogs, brochures and other materials.

""First, there are people who don't normally vote,"" he said. ""Nearly half the voting-age population was either not registered to vote, or was registered and decided not to vote in 2012. And if even 10 percent of that group was to show up and vote this year, it could easily change the outcome in the important swing states.""Sracic--who frankly admits he obsesses over opinion polls--wonders whether these voters are even represented in the endless presidential surveys: ""If people aren't registered voters, they won't be picked up by most polls. If they are registered voters but don't normally vote, they may be eliminated by 'likely voter' screens pollsters use."" Romney lost Pennsylvania in 2012 by about 300,000 votes out of about 5.5 million cast; in Ohio, he lost by less than 200,000. ""So bringing new people in can make a difference,"" Sracic said.Potentially more significant, however, are those voters who ""flip""--Sracic's second category. ""Remember,"" he said, ""taking a Democratic voter and having them vote Republican is both a +1 and a -1. In other words, if Romney lost Pennsylvania by 300,000 voters, all you have to do [this time] is flip slightly more than 150,000 votes."" Between Ohio and Pennsylvania, if approximately 225,000 voters (out of the 11 million who are expected on Election Day) switch parties, they could tip the entire election.""Writers such as National Review's correspondent Kevin Williamson have suggested that people who live in communities that are experiencing economic hard times should just pack up and move somewhere else,"" said Sracic.He believes that Williamson and others like him actually have a very narrow understanding of what constitutes and promotes happiness and wellbeing: ""People need jobs and enough money to survive, but they also desire community. Friends and family are important. When we talk about 'creative destruction' as being part of a vibrant national economy, we sometime miss the real damage that is done to the networks that sustain us.""If nearly everyone moves away, who is going to take care of mom and dad as they age? Are they expected to pull up roots, too, and leave the people and places they have known their whole lives? Many do leave, of course. Others stay--and watch the economy collapse around them. To many of these voters, Trump offers the hope that they won't have to make such an awful choice.One coal industry worker who registered to vote for the first time in 61 years told the Atlantic: ""This is about me. I am doing this for me, my hometown.""Clinton holds a small lead over Trump in recent Pennsylvania polls.Paul Sracic, a Youngstown State University political scientist, believes there are two categories of voters rallying to support Trump. ""First, there are people who don't normally vote,"" he said. ""Nearly half the voting-age population was either not registered to vote, or was registered and decided not to vote in 2012. And if even 10 percent of that group was to show up and vote this year, it could easily change the outcome in the important swing states.""
Sracic--who frankly admits he obsesses over opinion polls--wonders whether these voters are even represented in the endless presidential surveys: ""If people aren't registered voters, they won't be picked up by most polls. If they are registered voters but don't normally vote, they may be eliminated by 'likely voter' screens pollsters use."" Romney lost Pennsylvania in 2012 by about 300,000 votes out of about 5.5 million cast; in Ohio, he lost by less than 200,000. ""So bringing new people in can make a difference,"" Sracic said.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);Potentially more significant, however, are those voters who ""flip""--Sracic's second category. ""Remember,"" he said, ""taking a Democratic voter and having them vote Republican is both a +1 and a -1. In other words, if Romney lost Pennsylvania by 300,000 voters, all you have to do [this time] is flip slightly more than 150,000 votes."" Between Ohio and Pennsylvania, if approximately 225,000 voters (out of the 11 million who are expected on Election Day) switch parties, they could tip the entire election.
""Writers such as National Review's correspondent Kevin Williamson have suggested that people who live in communities that are experiencing economic hard times should just pack up and move somewhere else,"" said Sracic.
He believes that Williamson and others like him actually have a very narrow understanding of what constitutes and promotes happiness and wellbeing: ""People need jobs and enough money to survive, but they also desire community. Friends and family are important. When we talk about 'creative destruction' as being part of a vibrant national economy, we sometime miss the real damage that is done to the networks that sustain us.""
If nearly everyone moves away, who is going to take care of mom and dad as they age? Are they expected to pull up roots, too, and leave the people and places they have known their whole lives? Many do leave, of course. Others stay--and watch the economy collapse around them. To many of these voters, Trump offers the hope that they won't have to make such an awful choice.SIGN UP"	['Paul', 'Romney', 'Trump']	[]

One of those women, Paula Jones, was paid a settlement of $800,000 by Clinton.While the three other women's stories of unwanted sexual advances by Bill Clinton are compelling, the Kathy Shelton story is different because it directly involves Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton herself and underlying facts are not in dispute.

You would have hundreds of thousands of people who are held as human shields,"" said Lise Grande, the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq.""You would have a chemical attack that would put tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or maybe even more at grave risk. If all that were to happen at the same time it would be catastrophic,"" said Grande, noting that Islamic State has said it could use chemical weapons to defend the city.""In order to house and support and accommodate 1 million people at dignified standards we would be looking at an operation of $1 billion,"" she said.That is more than four times the $230 million the international body has received so far for the effort, funds which have only recently arrived.So far, a total of six camps have been built that can accommodate 50,000 people. Efforts are underway to construct 11 more, said Grande.Grande and Iraqi officials are hoping residents can stay home as long as possible to avoid being caught up in the crossfire once the shooting starts, and to avoid a mass exodus that would overwhelm relief efforts.Of the up to 1.5 million people believed to be in Mosul now, around 200,000 are expected to try and escape as Islamic State digs in for its most important fight.""If you were to see a forced population movement of more than 150,000 people, at that stage there isn't an institution in the world that could cope with that scale of movement,"" said Grande. ""What we are hoping is that the population movement is staggered. That it doesn't happen all at once.""Islamic State swept into Mosul in 2014 with virtually no resistance from the Iraqi army. Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared a caliphate and his followers took control, beheading or executing anyone suspected of opposing them.Mosul is a predominately Sunni city located in one of the most ethnically diverse parts of Iraq.Apart from the Iraqi army, an array of other forces aim to join in the battle against Islamic State, from Shi'ite militias to the peshmerga security forces of Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region, to a Sunni force backed by Turkey.The wrong mix could deepen sectarian divisions after Mosul is attacked, risking all-out civil war and more hardship.Securing aid resources is difficult when much of the Middle East, especially Syria, is locked in war. There are already more than 3 million people displaced in Iraq in connection with conflicts with Islamic State. Next door, 11 million Syrians are displaced.The United Nations has tried to understand what life is like under Islamic State in cities like Mosul, and has been in touch with informers inside the city since Islamic State arrived.The findings are grim. The price of food has risen sharply. Medicines are in short supply, even for the gravely ill. Many children are not in school.SIGN UP"	[]	[]
29	29	http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/10/13/exclusive-sen-jeff-sessions-wikileaks-revelation-hillary-clintons-support-open-borders-smoking-gun/	Exclusive — Sen. Jeff Sessions on WikiLeaks Revelation of Hillary Clinton’s Support for ‘Open Borders’: ‘It’s a Smoking Gun’	"NEW YORK CITY, New York -- Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, thinks the paid speech transcripts of Hillary Clinton revealing she supports open borders are a ""smoking gun"" in this election. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""It's a smoking gun,"" Sessions told Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM 125 The Patriot Channel on Thursday morning when asked for his reaction to the revelation.""Years ago it finally dawned on me: I used to say, and still do, the Democrats and liberals will pass any immigration bill as long as it doesn't work,"" Sessions said. He continued:What does that mean? It means they have never wanted a lawful system of immigration. They have frustrated it at every turn. They say they do, for 30 years they have promised and Republicans have promised to produce a lawful system of immigration. They've had multiple opportunities to do so with the American people supporting them overwhelmingly. But have they done it? No. Why? Just what that email reveals. She doesn't do it because she believes in open borders. That's where they want to take our country. They don't believe in borders. This is a deep philosophical question and the answer is crystal clear. You can't operate in this world today with open borders. Give me a break. You could spend hours explaining why. They never say it publicly because they know they can't defend it. So this is an incredible revealing statement that she is going to the American people right now claiming that Donald Trump made errors 10 or 20 years ago whereas she is perpetuating one of the greatest false campaigns ever saying she is going to have a lawful system of immigration when she has no intention whatsoever to do so.WikiLeaks, in the first email dump of now six total dumps of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's hacked emails, found partial transcripts of Hillary Clinton's position is in favor of open borders.""My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere,"" Hillary Clinton said on May 16, 2013, in a paid speech to Banco Itau, according to the leaked Podesta documents.Sessions that her remarks being for ""open trade"" were just as revealing as her support for ""open borders.""""This is because she views the future here in the Western Hemisphere and really worldwide, but initially she mentioned here, but her view is like the European Union--that the British just finally desperately extracted themselves from before they got sucked in it so deeply that their own laws cease to have meaning and that the people who have ruled them they can't control because they're in Brussels and not at home, not the people they elected,"" Session said on Breitbart News Daily.He added:So what she indicated there is that she wants a Hemispheric-wide--she didn't indicate it, she flat out admitted it, she wants a Hemispheric-wide common market which is the way the European Union formed. And she wants free movement of people and free movement of goods. This is indefensible. That's why she denies it. That's why she flipped on the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal that's a five thousand page deal that's probably the largest one in our history--it is the largest one in our history--and she supported it consistently. As Secretary of State, she helped write the dadgum thing. So give me a break. She's praised it. CNN found she praised it 44 times. A top Asian policy adviser who some say would be the next Secretary of State in her administration told Australians last summer that she may have said that but they're going to pass it anyway and now we have the WikiLeaks thing that proves beyond all doubt that on this critical issue she is flat lying to the American people. She intends to move forward. She'll make a few cosmetic changes, say the thing is fixed, and try to move it through Congress. That's just what's going to happen. It's a fundamental lie.Sessions framed this election as a referendum election on the important issues of the day, and said that because GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is ""standing firm"" he is ""taking the slings and arrows for us"" as a result of the fact he ""threatens the establishment.""""The bottom line is Donald Trump is right on trade, he's right on immigration, he's right on judges and the rule of law, he's right on Obamacare's failure and how people are suffering under this rigged system to the detriment of their concerns, their interests, while in secret Hillary Clinton and a lot of other establishment politicians meet with rich global interests and serve them when the chips are down and not the American people,"" Sessions said. He explained:This is--for me--this is how I got into this whole thing. It's a deep problem. The leadership in this country has drifted globalist. They've lost sight of the interests of and struggles of American working people. Working people's pleas to their government are right and just. They're not mean and stupid. They believe in a lawful system of immigration, and that's right and just. They believe in a system of immigration that protects their jobs and wages first, that when we have a job vacancy here the first thing we do is give a chance to American worker here not bringing in someone from abroad. My goodness, who do we owe our loyalty to? So they're right about that. They're right to be concerned about trade. I've done study on it. I've supported trade deals in the past, but we've done research: The results of these agreements are hurting the American people just like they thought when it passed. The American people never believed in these things yet the experts said we should do it and it was done by their leaders and the results are in.Sessions said that to make America great again, the country needs ""better tougher trade deals"" that ""protect American manufacturing, American jobs, and higher-paying jobs.""""And without a manufacturing base, this country can't be healthy and strong,"" Sessions said. ""We are being cheated by our trading partners. This is not a free market. This is a manipulated market by our competitors who want to seek an advantage for their countries and as Donald Trump says 'who's negotiating for us? Who's defending our interests?' Nobody. And as a result we have had a decline steadily in wages for middle America since 2000. Wages for median family income are down by $100 a month. We want wages going up not down.""Ultimately speaking, Sessions said he has never seen anything like what the media and political class are doing to take down Donald Trump. ""We were just looking very recently at the 'fact-checkers,' Washington Post and 'fact-checker' that are supposed to be so objective and fair,"" Sessions said. ""Both of them said that Donald Trump's charge and some of his supporters' like me that Hillary Clinton believes in open borders is 'false.' They just announce it as 'false,' that 'Donald Trump is not telling the truth.' Now what do we know? We know from the WikiLeaks that she absolutely favors open borders--that she used those words. So you think the fact checkers are going to turn around now and issue a report that Trump was right all along and they were wrong? They probably knew in her heart of hearts that she believed in open borders anyway, but they reported it differently.""The media--and political class--have ""circled the wagons,"" Sessions said, and ""they're defending the status quo.""""This is perhaps the last chance that the American people have to protect their country from danger, from dangerous terrorists from entering the country, from an unlawful system of immigration and such a huge flow that it's pulling down wages and job prospects for Americans and defend themselves against trade agreements that aren't working. It's time to have a leader that can look our trading partners in the eye and say 'you're going to stop these things' and 'we're not going to take it anymore' and 'we have the power to enforce it,'"" Sessions said. ""We can make that difference and improve that situation and change it in a way that benefits the people of America and makes it stronger.""Sessions concluded by making his--and Trump's--case to the undecided voters out there across the country. He also argued that Trump can again come back from the brink and might just pull off an upset victory in November.""This is a hugely important election for America,"" Sessions said, explaining:The American people are correct. By a 3-to-1 margin they believe we are on the wrong track, and we need to get on the right track. Hillary Clinton will not change the course we are on. She believes it's the right course. She will accelerate it. She will put the pedal to the metal. I said at the time I endorsed Donald Trump back in Alabama, I said at that time that he's not a perfect person with him standing right by me. We know that. We know that he has flaws. But his strength, his drive, his will and his correct position on the issues give us one last chance to put this country on the right path. And the American people need to have their voices heard for a chance and need to make sure their politicians don't pull the wool over their eyes and go through the election complaining about decades old problems with Donald Trump when Hillary Clinton at this very moment is participating in one of the greatest frauds on the American people by continuing on her idea of open borders and open trade. That's the choice for us. She won't stand up and explain it because she knows once it's fully known by the American people they'll reject it. So this is a huge election. I just urge our people to focus on the big issues and to understand what it is at stake--and there are a lot of others like the courts and Obamacare and taxes and regulations, Trump is right on all of those issues; classical Republican issues. This is a big election. Polls can give you a snapshot at a certain time, but they don't tell you how they can move. Trump has been up twice since the Republican convention.

That's why she flipped on the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal that's a five thousand page deal that's probably the largest one in our history--it is the largest one in our history--and she supported it consistently. As Secretary of State, she helped write the dadgum thing. So give me a break. She's praised it. CNN found she praised it 44 times. A top Asian policy adviser who some say would be the next Secretary of State in her administration told Australians last summer that she may have said that but they're going to pass it anyway and now we have the WikiLeaks thing that proves beyond all doubt that on this critical issue she is flat lying to the American people. She intends to move forward. She'll make a few cosmetic changes, say the thing is fixed, and try to move it through Congress. That's just what's going to happen. It's a fundamental lie.Sessions framed this election as a referendum election on the important issues of the day, and said that because GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is ""standing firm"" he is ""taking the slings and arrows for us"" as a result of the fact he ""threatens the establishment.""""The bottom line is Donald Trump is right on trade, he's right on immigration, he's right on judges and the rule of law, he's right on Obamacare's failure and how people are suffering under this rigged system to the detriment of their concerns, their interests, while in secret Hillary Clinton and a lot of other establishment politicians meet with rich global interests and serve them when the chips are down and not the American people,"" Sessions said. He explained:This is--for me--this is how I got into this whole thing. It's a deep problem. The leadership in this country has drifted globalist. They've lost sight of the interests of and struggles of American working people. Working people's pleas to their government are right and just. They're not mean and stupid. They believe in a lawful system of immigration, and that's right and just. They believe in a system of immigration that protects their jobs and wages first, that when we have a job vacancy here the first thing we do is give a chance to American worker here not bringing in someone from abroad. My goodness, who do we owe our loyalty to? So they're right about that. They're right to be concerned about trade. I've done study on it. I've supported trade deals in the past, but we've done research: The results of these agreements are hurting the American people just like they thought when it passed. The American people never believed in these things yet the experts said we should do it and it was done by their leaders and the results are in.Sessions said that to make America great again, the country needs ""better tougher trade deals"" that ""protect American manufacturing, American jobs, and higher-paying jobs.""""And without a manufacturing base, this country can't be healthy and strong,"" Sessions said. ""We are being cheated by our trading partners. This is not a free market. This is a manipulated market by our competitors who want to seek an advantage for their countries and as Donald Trump says 'who's negotiating for us? Who's defending our interests?' Nobody. And as a result we have had a decline steadily in wages for middle America since 2000. Wages for median family income are down by $100 a month. We want wages going up not down.""Ultimately speaking, Sessions said he has never seen anything like what the media and political class are doing to take down Donald Trump. ""We were just looking very recently at the 'fact-checkers,' Washington Post and 'fact-checker' that are supposed to be so objective and fair,"" Sessions said. ""Both of them said that Donald Trump's charge and some of his supporters' like me that Hillary Clinton believes in open borders is 'false.' They just announce it as 'false,' that 'Donald Trump is not telling the truth.' Now what do we know? We know from the WikiLeaks that she absolutely favors open borders--that she used those words. So you think the fact checkers are going to turn around now and issue a report that Trump was right all along and they were wrong? They probably knew in her heart of hearts that she believed in open borders anyway, but they reported it differently.""The media--and political class--have ""circled the wagons,"" Sessions said, and ""they're defending the status quo.""""This is perhaps the last chance that the American people have to protect their country from danger, from dangerous terrorists from entering the country, from an unlawful system of immigration and such a huge flow that it's pulling down wages and job prospects for Americans and defend themselves against trade agreements that aren't working. It's time to have a leader that can look our trading partners in the eye and say 'you're going to stop these things' and 'we're not going to take it anymore' and 'we have the power to enforce it,'"" Sessions said. ""We can make that difference and improve that situation and change it in a way that benefits the people of America and makes it stronger.""Sessions concluded by making his--and Trump's--case to the undecided voters out there across the country. He also argued that Trump can again come back from the brink and might just pull off an upset victory in November.""This is a hugely important election for America,"" Sessions said, explaining:The American people are correct. By a 3-to-1 margin they believe we are on the wrong track, and we need to get on the right track. Hillary Clinton will not change the course we are on. She believes it's the right course. She will accelerate it. She will put the pedal to the metal. I said at the time I endorsed Donald Trump back in Alabama, I said at that time that he's not a perfect person with him standing right by me. We know that. We know that he has flaws. But his strength, his drive, his will and his correct position on the issues give us one last chance to put this country on the right path. And the American people need to have their voices heard for a chance and need to make sure their politicians don't pull the wool over their eyes and go through the election complaining about decades old problems with Donald Trump when Hillary Clinton at this very moment is participating in one of the greatest frauds on the American people by continuing on her idea of open borders and open trade. That's the choice for us. She won't stand up and explain it because she knows once it's fully known by the American people they'll reject it. So this is a huge election. I just urge our people to focus on the big issues and to understand what it is at stake--and there are a lot of others like the courts and Obamacare and taxes and regulations, Trump is right on all of those issues; classical Republican issues. This is a big election. Polls can give you a snapshot at a certain time, but they don't tell you how they can move. Trump has been up twice since the Republican convention. Why can't he come back again? He absolutely can.LISTEN TO SEN. SESSIONS ON BREITBART NEWS DAILY:"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
