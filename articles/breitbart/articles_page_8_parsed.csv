Chuck Schumer, is having trouble finding a fellow Senator to run the caucus' election campaign in 2018.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSchumer, who will soon take his place as the Minority Leader in a GOP-run Senate, needs a fellow Senator to run the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, according to Politico. The chairman is supposed to help elect new Democratic Senators by raising campaign funds, recruiting good candidates and setting the strategy But that is likely a thankless job, because only one GOP Senator is in much danger of losing his seat in 2018, while 10 of 25 Democratic Senators up for election in 2018 are based in states where Hillary Clinton lost by large or landslide margins.No one wants to run the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, @politico reports. https://t.co/si99DJ0yZV-- Byron Tau (@ByronTau) November 15, 2016Schumer's choices seem to be dwindling as a number of candidates have already taken themselves out of the running. Reportedly Chris Van Hollen (D, MD), Cory Booker (D, NJ), Al Franken (D, MN), Chris Coons (D, DE), and Jeanne Shaheen (D, NH) each have already removed themselves from consideration.Making matters stickier for Schumer, Democrats Patty Murray (Washington State) and Dick Durbin (Illinois) are preparing to slug it out for the Senate Minority Leadership's number two position, a spot Durbin already holds.According to a grim assessment by the Washington Post, Democrats have fallen to a low of only five states where they control both the legislature and the governor's mansion. Meanwhile, Republicans control the state governments of fully 25 states and have mixed control over another 19. Republicans now have more control over state legislatures than they've had since the 1920s.Senate Democrats aren't the only ones having trouble figuring out how to fix their leadership woes. House Democrats also recently postponed their vote for leadership for the upcoming session of Congress.House Democrats had scheduled a vote to return California Democrat and current House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to her role as their leader. But by Tuesday, Democrats decided to postpone their vote, leading many to speculate that Pelosi, who has held the role through years of declining Democrat influence, may be on the outs with her fellows.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.No one wants to run the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, @politico reports. https://t.co/si99DJ0yZV

He has said he will sue news organisations. He has labelled the press 'dishonest' and 'scum',"" the paper states.What evidently tied the paper's briefs in a bundle was Trump's calling out media dishonesty and their shameless pandering to the Left. His outspoken criticisms of the mainstream media earned him their eternal ire, while emboldening Americans tired of being preached at by their newspapers.As a Nov. 7 article in Business Insider noted, this presidential election ""may have the most lopsided batch of newspaper endorsements the US has ever seen,"" with newspapers and journals overwhelmingly snubbing the Republican candidate in favor of Secretary Clinton. Because of their open commitment to the Clinton campaign, it only stood to reason that their reporting on Trump would be similarly skewed.As many observers have noted, the biggest losers in the election was the establishment media, whose credibility has sunk to an all-time low.Undaunted, the Guardian declares: ""At times like this, free and fearless investigative journalism is never more important,"" as if their man-bites-dog story will manage to convince anyone.In its attempt to whip up fears of Trump for its own sordid gains, the Guardian begs for donations to make up for its flagging readership.""Our independent journalism,"" the paper claims, ""over the next four years will continue to uncover the truth, sort fact from fiction, and hold the new administration to account."" Attentive readers will no doubt wonder how the paper can ""continue"" something it has yet to start.If there is one lesson the election taught Americans, it is that the establishment media has been the primary enemy of free speech and honest debate. In their efforts to smear Donald Trump and his supporters, they resorted to the lowest forms of deceit, trickery, mean-spirited slurs, and outright lies.In the face of this, the Guardian's pitiful fundraising appeal sounds eerily like a death wheeze.Follow Thomas D.

Lester Feder provides a transcript of a speech given by Donald Trump's new chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon in the summer of 2014 before a conference at the Vatican focused on poverty. Bannon's remarks predicted the coming populist movements and detailed how the concurrent forces of militant radical Islam, the corrupt crony capitalism of ""the Party of Davos,"" and the dehumanizing secularization of the West were all converging into a global conflict.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom Buzzfeed's transcript:And we're at the end stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if the people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that's starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years.Now, what I mean by that specifically: I think that you're seeing three kinds of converging tendencies: One is a form of capitalism that is taken away from the underlying spiritual and moral foundations of Christianity and, really, Judeo-Christian belief....But there's a strand of capitalism today -- two strands of it, that are very disturbing.One is state-sponsored capitalism. And that's the capitalism you see in China and Russia. I believe it's what Holy Father [Pope Francis] has seen for most of his life in places like Argentina, where you have this kind of crony capitalism of people that are involved with these military powers-that-be in the government, and it forms a brutal form of capitalism that is really about creating wealth and creating value for a very small subset of people. And it doesn't spread the tremendous value creation throughout broader distribution patterns that were seen really in the 20th century.The second form of capitalism that I feel is almost as disturbing, is what I call the Ayn Rand or the Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism. And, look, I'm a big believer in a lot of libertarianism. I have many many friends that's a very big part of the conservative movement -- whether it's the UKIP movement in England, it's many of the underpinnings of the populist movement in Europe, and particularly in the United States.However, that form of capitalism is quite different when you really look at it to what I call the ""enlightened capitalism"" of the Judeo-Christian West. It is a capitalism that really looks to make people commodities, and to objectify people, and to use them almost -- as many of the precepts of Marx -- and that is a form of capitalism, particularly to a younger generation [that] they're really finding quite attractive. And if they don't see another alternative, it's going to be an alternative that they gravitate to under this kind of rubric of ""personal freedom.""Read the rest of the transcript here.Listen to the audio of Bannon's speech:SIGN UP"	[]	['creation']

So they're more than happy to ignore and cast aside the policies that got Trump elected in exchange for going along with the Ryan's policies. They'd rather keep the status quo and march lockstep with Ryan than have to stir things up by electing someone who would fight for Trump's mandate and fight to fulfill the wishes of the American people.The same message is getting out to establishment media outlets.""Republican congressional leaders are already trying to twist"" the platform that got Trump elected into something that more closely aligns with their own agenda, Capitol Hill reporter Matt Fuller writes:House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has already begun the long Washington slog of twisting President-elect Donald Trump's agenda into something less Trump, with the California Republican insisting on Monday that Trump's border wall just meant border security and mass deportations just meant deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records.Fuller followed up on Twitter:This is not what Trump ran on. This is not what voters were told. This is not what they voted for.But Congress, Trump fans, Amirite??-- Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) November 15, 2016Similarly, on Sunday, Paul Ryan told CNN that removing illegal aliens was not going to be a ""focus"" of Donald Trump's administration. Ryan has been a vocal supporter of immigration amnesty and has a two-decade-long history of pushing for open borders immigration policies. Indeed, open borders advocate Luis Gutierrez has previously described Ryan as his ""guiding light"" on immigration, and was one of Ryan's earliest backers for House Speaker last year.Breitbart News spoke to several top aides to members in the House Freedom Caucus-- all of whose members voted for Paul Ryan as House Speaker last year.The aides explain that, while it has gone virtually unreported by corporate media, many members of the Freedom Caucus never shared Trump's-- nor their constituents'--desire to curb immigration into the United States, nor did they share his skepticism of globalist trade policies.As such, top aides to members of the House Freedom Caucus now say that many of the group's members are more than happy to accept what Conservative Review has described as leadership's effort to ""bastardize"" Trump's platform.According to polling data, Paul Ryan's vision on trade and immigration is opposed by roughly nine in 10 GOP voters.Yet despite the clear opposition of their constituents, ""A lot of House Freedom Caucus members really don't oppose Ryan's positions on trade and immigration,"" a separate senior aide for a conservative member of the group told Breitbart. ""Typically the issues that unite the House Freedom Caucus are spending and government issues.""Prior reports have similarly documented House Freedom Caucus members' support for Ryan's open borders agenda.""I think if you were to poll all of the Freedom Caucus members, they'd say that Paul Ryan is an improvement over Boehner, but that they'd still prefer someone better. The members just don't have a plan to do anything about it."" the aide added.""Privately, a lot of the members would probably tell you that they thought the 'Better Way' [agenda] was not a huge success- and maybe was even a failure. It definitely didn't send people to the polls,"" the aide said.""Everybody in the House Freedom Caucus and the establishment, at this point, is looking to play the reconciliatory game of saying: 'Well, Trump was really saying what I've been saying all along.' Of course, we all know this isn't true. The people who voted for him don't think that's what he was running on,"" another House Freedom Caucus aide told Breitbart.""I worry we've got establishment Republicans like Mike Pence and Reince Priebus trying to tell Trump that the people who voted for him didn't really mean X or didn't really want Y. That worries me,"" the aide added.The stealth co-opting of Trump's agenda is perhaps best evidenced by former Ryan advisor Dan Senor who-- despite actively working to undermine Trump's chances of electoral success during the election-- now says the Republican Party is unified around the realization that it finally has an opportunity to enact tax reform. Senor told CBS:When I talked to Republicans yesterday what I'm struck by, is that they're sitting there saying some of us may have had our differences with Donald Trump and the kind of campaign he waged, but at the end of the day we've been wanting for years to get big things done on tax reform, in repeal and replace of Obamacare, in getting rid of some of these regulations... overturned. [...] And we couldn't get it done without unified Republican control of the executive branch and legislative branch. Now we have it.Notably, Senor excluded any mention of enacting reforms on policies like trade or immigration that propelled Trump to victory.All of the aides-even those whose bosses plan to vote for Ryan-said that it's doubtful as House Speaker Paul Ryan would ever champion or expend political capital or twist arms to enact Trump's mandate on the critical issues of trade and immigration.As late-conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly explained in August, Trump's agenda stands diametrically opposed to that of current House Speaker Paul Ryan's.  ""I think one of the reasons Trump was nominated was because he wants to put America first and defend the interests of the United States,"" Schlafly said. ""Obviously, Paul Ryan is not an 'America first' guy.""While Tuesday's Speaker election is just an internal election--and the more formal election comes when the members return at the beginning of January--the ""significance of the election Tuesday is the fact that Ryan decided to go ahead and rush it through on Tuesday,"" one aide told Breitbart. ""He was asked to delay it, which would allow returning Members to consider his handling of the Lame Duck and newly elected Members could at least meet a few people. He decided to stick with the old, heavy-handed way of doing business,"" the aide said.House Freedom Caucus members have noted that Ryan has broken several significant promises he made to them to secure their vote for him as House Speaker.For instance, Ryan promised immigration hawk Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks that he would not bring up any major immigration legislation while Barack Obama was president. Ryan swiftly broke that promise by quadrupling the controversial H-2B guest worker program in his omnibus spending bill, which immigration attorney Ian Smith explained would disproportionately ""hurt America's most vulnerable workers"" by allowing them to be replaced by temporary foreign workers.Brooks, who indicated that he is leaning towards supporting Ryan for Speaker, now says that he has gotten a new promise from Ryan on the issue of immigration.Brooks was quick to admit that he has no reason to believe that Ryan will keep his promise to him this year any better than he did last.Congressman Dave Brat, who voted against Ryan last year and urged for a delay of Tuesday's leadership election, noted that ""Speaker Ryan promised last year that if elected, he would adhere to regular order. It didn't happen,"" Brat wrote. ""This year, the House didn't even vote on a budget.""""Is this what the American people want?"" Brat asked.The House Freedom Caucus's stated purpose is to give ""a voice to countless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them."" It remains unclear whether the group's members believe that their constituents are entitled to Congressional leadership that represents their views on these significant issues, which were at the center of the 2016 election.Members of the House Freedom Caucus include, among others: Jim Jordan, Mick Mulvaney, Raul Labrador, Dave Brat, Mo Brooks, Jeff Duncan, Matt Salmon, Mark Meadows, John Fleming, Jim Bridenstine, Justin Amash, Barry Loudermilk, Gary Palmer, and Alex Mooney.Many members of the Freedom Caucus never opposed Ryan's positions on trade and immigration the way their constituents do. So they're more than happy to ignore and cast aside the policies that got Trump elected in exchange for going along with the Ryan's policies. They'd rather keep the status quo and march lockstep with Ryan than have to stir things up by electing someone who would fight for Trump's mandate and fight to fulfill the wishes of the American people.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has already begun the long Washington slog of twisting President-elect Donald Trump's agenda into something less Trump, with the California Republican insisting on Monday that Trump's border wall just meant border security and mass deportations just meant deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records.This is not what Trump ran on.

According to CNN, and I quote -- ""white nationalist leaders are praising Trump's decision to name Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist."" In the same article, they say they see Bannon ""as an advocate for policies they favor.""According to [Southern] Poverty Law Center, Bannon ""was the main driver between [sic] Breitbart becoming a white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill.""

That's a court document.By placing a champion of white supremacists a step away from the Oval Office, what message does Trump send to the young girl who woke up Wednesday morning in Rhode Island afraid to be a woman of color in America? It's not a message of healing. If Trump is serious about seeking unity, the first thing he should do is rescind his appointment of Steve Bannon.Rescind it. Don't do it. Think about this.

Instead of hiding behind your Twitter account, and show America that racism, bullying, and bigotry have no place in the White House or in America.Sen. John Cornyn spoke on the Senate floor after Reid and accused the Democrat of being a sore loser. ""We used to call people like that 'sore losers,'"" he said.

The GOP conference gave the Wisconsin Republican voice-vote approval, forgoing a secret ballot tally that would have shown how many Republicans oppose Ryan leading the chamber.""Ryan still must win a floor vote in January to officially retain his gavel. That will require him to garner the support of a majority of the House, typically 218 Republicans -- giving him little wiggle room with his conference,"" Politico notes.According to the report, ""Toward the end of the closed-door conference, [Rep. Louie] Gohmert used an open mic to accuse Ryan of being soft on border security after Trump won and 'insulting' the President-elect by suggesting in press conferences and on TV that Trump 'heard a voice' no other politicians had.""Ryan was nominated by House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Mick Mulvaney, who shares Ryan's support for open borders immigration policies. A 2015 PBS documentary revealed how both Ryan and Mulvaney were at the center of the 2013-2014 La Raza-backed effort to enact Obama's amnesty agenda.According to Pew polling data, Ryan's expansionist immigration agenda is opposed by more than nine in ten GOP voters. Similarly, nearly nine in ten GOP voters oppose Paul Ryan's vision on trade, according to polling data from a recent POLITICO pro-Harvard survey.It remains unclear whether members of the House Freedom Caucus will vote in January to re-elect as House Speaker a man whose globalist positions on immigration and trade are opposed by the vast majority of their constituents.Some prominent movement conservatives have expressed concern that Ryan will not work to enact Donald Trump's mandate given to him by the American people. As Phyllis Schlafly's hand-chosen successor and president of her Eagle Forum organization, Ed Martin, has explained:Now is the time to move forward on the Trump agenda, not back to the failed Ryan policies... On Tuesday, November 8, the American voters showed conclusively that Paul Ryan is not the leader for this moment in our history.  The message is clear: Ryan's judgment was rejected!The House Freedom Caucus's stated purpose is to give ""a voice to countless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them."" Yet as one senior aide to a member of the House Freedom Caucus explained, ""Many members of the Freedom Caucus never opposed Ryan's positions on trade and immigration the way their constituents do. So they're more than happy to ignore and cast aside the policies that got Trump elected in exchange for going along with the Ryan's policies.""""At a certain point, we're going to have to change our group's name from the 'House Freedom Caucus' to the 'Paul Ryan Caucus,'"" the aide told Breitbart.House Republicans on Tuesday afternoon unanimously nominated Paul Ryan for a second term as Speaker.

The only exception was Democrat Lyndon Baines Johnson's landslide victory after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.California's demographic mix in 1988 was 57 percent non-Hispanic whites and 26 percent Latinos. But as the once-minority population rose to a plurality of 39 percent, or 15.3 million by 2014, Latinos became the dominant group and non-Hispanic whites a minority.California's non-Hispanic voters have trended independent over the last 25 years. But the reason 47 percent of state voters are Democrats, while 27 percent are Republicans and 26 percent independents, is that 62 percent of new Latinos voters have registered as Democrats.The biggest driver for California's Latino population growth has been Democrat public policies favoring illegal immigration. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) reported that ""the generous welfare benefits offered by some states have magnetic effects and alter the geographic sorting of immigrants in the United States - attracting many to California.""The NBER found a direct correlation between the immigration flow and California's generous welfare benefits, which are 89 percent larger than those in Illinois, and 280 percent greater than those offered by Texas. Fully 45.4 percent of recent U.S. immigrants receiving welfare now live in California.According to Pew Research, 1 out of every 12 newborns in the United States each year is an ""anchor baby,"" a U.S.-born child of an illegal alien. But for the 3 million illegal aliens in California, 1 in 5 newborns are ""anchor babies.""California's $170.9 billion state budget serves as the biggest illegal alien magnet in the nation. ""The wall"" and deportations will slow illegal immigration into California. But President Trump could have a ""yuge"" impact by using his executive authority to stop the disbursement of hundreds of billions of federal dollars that fund California's ""illegal immigration magnet.""That is because President Bill Clinton passed the ""Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996,"" which denies illegal aliens access to ""appropriated funds of the United States"" for ""federal public benefits,"" including health, welfare, food assistance, housing assistance, unemployment, retirement, postsecondary education and hundreds of other programs.President Trump can turn off California's illegal immigration magnet on his first day in office simply by enforcing existing federal law. What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kennedy']	[]

""I want to work on building a caucus where other members don't take money from PACs. And we have to brand that caucus.""Khanna said that his intended focus during his first term in Congress will be on bringing manufacturing jobs back to America, removing the influence of special interest groups, and the repatriation of offshore funds back into America.Khanna defeated fellow Democrat, eight-term incumbent Rep. Mike Honda, by nearly 22 percentage points, following a long and at times tough battle for the 17th Congressional District.He added that he wanted to eradicate the influence of money from both corporate PACs and union PACs, which typically support the Democratic Party. Further, he said, ""we need term limits and I'll work across the aisle to impose these term limits."" He said he would look to follow California's model, which allows for two terms in Senate and six terms in the House.Khanna said he has placed his focus on bipartisan issues that transcend political lines, which is why he says he sees manufacturing as being key to America's future -- so much so that he wrote about a book about it in 2012.In his book Entrepreneurial Nation: Why Manufacturing is Still Key to America's Future, Khanna makes a compelling argument for bringing home those jobs America has lost to overseas competition, and notes: ""Despite everything you've heard about the economy, one fact remains: America continues to be a world leader in manufacturing."" He adds: ""[T]his is entrepreneurial nation.""The newly-elected congressman said he plans on working towards dropping bad trade deals and currency manipulation, and spreading the innovation of Silicon Valley into the heart of Middle America. ""People are upset over jobs and that the system is rigged,"" Khanna said. They want to know how ""we unrig Congress.""Khanna, who is of Indian origin, was born in Pennsylvania and grew up in Ohio. ""We get the heart and soul of this country is the Midwest,"" he said, even though ""I'll be the Democratic congressman from Silicon Valley.""He added: ""We have trillions of dollars offshore and we've got to figure out how to bring that money back and reinvest it in jobs here. Let's reduce the tax to allow them to bring it back. But once they bring it back, they need to use that money to invest into businesses.""He said he will work towards finding a way to incentivize companies to invest in manufacturing jobs, saying this is an agenda that ""transcends partisan politics.""Like President-elect Donald Trump, Khanna was opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. ""I totally opposed TPP. I think that was a bad deal for American workers. It was a bad deal for our manufacturing industry.""Regarding the rampant abuse and misuse of America's H1-B visa program, Khanna called for reform in order to ensure it's no longer being abused by corporations who shove American workers aside to make way for foreign workers willing to take the same positions for far less compensation.""Of course we want to create jobs,"" Khanna said. ""But it shouldn't be at the expense of the American workers.""SIGN UPEntrepreneurial Nation: Why Manufacturing is Still Key to America's Future, Khanna makes a compelling argument for bringing home those jobs America has lost to overseas competition, and notes: ""Despite everything you've heard about the economy, one fact remains: America continues to be a world leader in manufacturing.""

Reuters reports:""Republicans are going to continue to support the freedom to trade,"" the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee said.When it comes to the controversial TPP, which president-elect Donald Trump has opposed, Brady said the plan was defensible.""Don't withdraw, renegotiate,"" he told a panel of the Wall Street Journal CEO Council. ""There is plenty that levels the playing field. Renegotiate. Fix the problems that exist today. Let's find a way to move forward.""TPP, which is not simply a ""trade deal"" but the creation of a new global governing structure, of weighs in at 5,554 pages and can only be reviewed in a secret, secured room in Washington, D.C. by congressmen and aides with certain security clearances. Under current fast-track rules, it cannot by amended or filibustered by Congress.Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, who backed Trump in the GOP primaries, has criticized TPP in the strongest of terms:This is, by definition, anti-democratic. No individual American has the resources to ensure his or her economic and political interests are safeguarded within this vast global regulatory structure. The predictable and surely desired result of the TPP is to put greater distance between the governed and those who govern. It puts those who make the rules out of reach of those who live under them, empowering unelected regulators who cannot be recalled or voted out of office. In turn, it diminishes the power of the people's bulwark: their constitutionally-formed Congress...Among the TPP's endless pages are rules for labor, environment, immigration and every aspect of global commerce - and a new international regulatory structure to promulgate, implement, and enforce these rules,"" Sessions said. ""This new structure is known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission - a Pacific Union - which meets, appoints unelected bureaucrats, adopts rules, and changes the agreement after adoption...These 5,554 pages are like the Lilliputians binding down Gulliver. They will enmesh our great country, and economy, in a global commission where bureaucrats from Brunei have the same vote as the United States. Clearly, powerful forces will have their voices heard and find ways to profit immensely from this conglomeration. But what of everyday wage-earning Americans? By nearly a 5:1 margin, they believe such deals reduce wages - not increase them. Because this deal lacks currency protections, it will further the bleeding of U.S. manufacturing jobs overseas, allowing our mercantilist trading partners to take advantage of our continued refusal to protect our own workers.Trump also slammed TPP repeatedly on the campaign trail.""If [Hillary Clinton] is elected President she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good,"" Trump said in late June. ""Just as she has betrayed the American worker and trade at every single stage of her career and it will be even worse than the Clinton's NAFTA deal. And I never thought it could get worse than that. We will lose jobs. We will lose employment. We will lose taxes. We will lose everything. We will lose our country.""There is ""no way forward"" for the 12-nation agreement now, Obama administration officials told reporters after Nov. 8. If Republicans in Congress resurrect the multi-nation agreement, it's likely to be vetoed by President Trump.""Republicans are going to continue to support the freedom to trade,"" the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee said.
When it comes to the controversial TPP, which president-elect Donald Trump has opposed, Brady said the plan was defensible.
""Don't withdraw, renegotiate,"" he told a panel of the Wall Street Journal CEO Council. ""There is plenty that levels the playing field. Renegotiate. Fix the problems that exist today.

He said media coverage of the healthcare law has been ""completely misleading"" and that Obamacare ""has actually saved people money.""""You made up the fact that Obamacare has caused job loss,"" he said. ""There is no evidence...there is none...look at the data. There is not a single data point.""Bartiromo countered her ""data"" are CEOs of businesses who come on her show and say they are not hiring more employees because they don't want to incur the costs of Obamacare.""Who cares if some CEO comes on the show and tells you that's the reason?"" Gruber responded. ""That's not how you consider data.""Writing at Investors Business Daily (IBD) in 2014, Jed Graham observed the Obama administration was dismissing the idea that Obamacare would create job losses due to its costs:White House economists dismiss such evidence as anecdotal, but BLS data show that the workweek in low-wage sectors sank to a record low in July -- just before the Obama administration delayed enforcement of the employer mandate until 2015.In the interest of an informed debate, we've compiled a list of job actions with strong proof that ObamaCare's employer mandate is behind cuts to work hours or staffing levels. As of September 5th, our ObamaCare scorecard included 450 employers with more than 100 school districts among them. Recently, IBD explained that a big minimum wage hike alongside the employer mandate would add to pressure on employers to cut workers to part-time, complicating the goal of reducing inequality.Bartiromo also slammed Gruber on his comments in which he said Obamacare's planners counted on the ""stupidity"" of the American voter to ""get the thing to pass."" Gruber countered that while he ""regretted"" those words, he insists they were ""taken out of context"" because he was speaking at an academic conference.White House economists dismiss such evidence as anecdotal, but BLS data show that the workweek in low-wage sectors sank to a record low in July -- just before the Obama administration delayed enforcement of the employer mandate until 2015.

Bannon his senior counselor and chief strategist, and now the lies, smears, and defamation of Bannon have begun. I know well how this process works. It's evil. As the enemedia bombards us with claims that Bannon is a white supremacist and an anti-Semite, I am, as a Jew and a proud Zionist, honored to stand up for Steve Bannon.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERI am fortunate to say that I have known and worked with Steve Bannon ever since the tragic passing of Andrew Breitbart. While he was at Breitbart, he would ask me to write articles on pressing issues -- usually several times each week. Longtime readers who are deeply familiar with my work know that I am a fiercely proud Jew and unapologetic Zionist. As long as I have known Steve, he has been an unabashed supporter of Israel, and of those of us who fight against Jew-hatred and racism. Unequivocally.He is whip-smart, courageous, bold, and loyal.Now the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is claiming that he is anti-Semitic? What? He partnered with Andrew Breitbart -- a Jew. He partnered with Larry Solov, another Jew, after Breitbart died. He worked with me -- a Jew. He gave proud and fierce Zionists such as Aaron Klein a platform to speak and advance the cause of the Jewish people and the Jewish state. Breitbart Jerusalem was launched under Bannon's tenure with the Breitbart organization.The ADL haters' attacks on Steve Bannon make him an honorary Jew. The ADL has a consistent record of attacks on proud Jews and Zionists. The ADL has attacked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Joan Rivers, and even Israel itself. The ADL should be sued for fraud. They raise money on the premise that they ""fight antisemitism."" On the contrary, they fuel and align with the world's most vicious Jew-haters. The ADL gave an award to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, despite his long record of anti-Semitic statements.I have crossed swords for years with this vicious leftist ""Jewish"" organization -- starting with their refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide. If a group claiming to represent the Jews fails to recognize the template, the mass slaughter that inspired Hitler, then we have failed to learn anything from history. In whitewashing the Armenian genocide, the ADL is as culpable as the Islamic perpetrators.Meanwhile, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) claimed that Bannon was ""the main driver behind Breitbart becoming a white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill."" The SPLC is a well-funded group that works furiously to silence dissent and impose a totalitarian straitjacket on the public discourse on these issues, only allowing voices that toe their propaganda line about Islam being a religion of peace and Muslims as the victims, rather than the perpetrators, of terrorism.The SPLC uses its hate group listings to demonize conservatives and anyone who dissents from its statist, authoritarian agenda. Its hate group list is so tendentious and politically motivated that the SPLC was removed from a government website's listing of resources on hate groups.The ill-gotten wealth of the SPLC amounts to tens of millions of dollars, while those whom they target, the supporters of freedom, are meagerly financed by average Americans who want freedom preserved in this country.As for what Bannon's ex-wife said in their divorce papers, don't even go there. People are at their worst during a divorce. They will say anything and do anything to get the kids, the money, the house, whatever. It is all wild mudslinging, and I accuse ""journalists"" such as Jake Tapper of committing defamation and libel in their rage over the fact that that quisling crook Hillary lost and lost big.I did a BBC interview Monday afternoon in Bannon's defense. It was supposed to be a Trump interview, but it was all Bannon, and the BBC was gunning for him. I took them apart -- it will be interesting to see what they run.The establishment media and establishment leftist organizations such as the SPLC and the ADL, as well as the DNC, are trying to do to Trump and Bannon what they successfully did to Allen West's chief of staff, Joyce Kaufman, shortly after West was elected to Congress in 2010: ignite a media firestorm that forces him to change the personnel of his staff to suit his enemies. West blinked and fired Kaufman.Trump must hold firm. He has been on the receiving end of the most vicious smears and libels. That's why my money is on him. He won't take the bait.The good news is that the people know. The people know the enemedia and what their agenda is. It won't work. Not anymore.Pamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of PamelaGeller.com and author of The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.

Bannon against accusations of anti-Semitism -- which erupted after president-elect Donald Trump announced that Bannon would serve as White House Chief Strategist.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom The Hill:You recently attacked Bannon's appointment as senior adviser to the president, saying, ""It is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the 'alt-right' -- a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists -- is slated to be a senior staff member in the 'people's house.'"" Your comment was widely -- though perhaps unfairly -- interpreted as accusing Bannon of anti-Semitism.I barely know Mr. Bannon, having met him for the first time last week at The New York Hilton. But I do know Joel Pollak, an orthodox Jew who is my friend of many years and is a senior editor at Breitbart. Joel is one of the proudest Jews I know and one of the premier fighters for Israel in the national media.He tells me that Steve Bannon has shown him, and the many other Jewish employees at Breitbart, especially those who are observant, incredible sensitivity and flexibility in helping them always keep the Sabbath and observe the Jewish holidays.In addition, Breitbart has served as one of the leading publications in The United States that strongly opposed the Iran nuclear agreement, with its $150 billion given to the murderous Mullahs and their genocidal promise to perpetrate a second holocaust of the Jewish people.I know this is close to both our hearts. Your wife was forced to flee the bloodthirsty Khomeini regime as a teenager. My father and his family were lucky to leave Iran well before Khomeini came to power.In light of this fact, why would you immediately assume that Breitbart is anti-Semitic? Some of the world's leading publications -- including The New York Times -- extolled the virtues of the Iran deal even though it never even punished the Iranian regime for being in constant violation of the 1948 UN Anti-Genocide Convention which expressly forbids genocidal incitement.Even the ADL opposed the Iran deal and Breitbart stood with the pro-Israel community in making the argument against an agreement that legally gives Iran nuclear weapons in little over a decade.Breitbart also defends Israel constantly against the anti-Semitic BDS movement whose goal is the economic destruction of the State of Israel.That does not mean that we need agree with everything published on Breitbart or that there will not be columns we find offensive.I write for many publications, some more on the left, like The Daily Beast and The Huffington Post, some considered in the middle like CNN, The Washington Post, and The Hill, and some more to the right like The Wall Street Journal and Breitbart. I also write for Israel-based publications like The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel, with their differing editorial slants. In all those publications there are those with whom I agree and disagree with strongly.I have published hundreds of columns in The Huffington Post and consider Arianna Huffington a personal friend. I can tell you that I shared the home page many times with people who vilified Israel in pretty extreme terms. I never took offense. And I certainly never called the editors there anti-Semitic. Rather, I saw the attacks on Israel as an opportunity to respond intelligently and forcefully.The Jewish people, as you and I can both agree, face a new era of increased anti-Semitism, especially among Islamist governments and increasingly in Europe. We have real enemies who need to be combatted. Israel especially faces three emboldened, genocidal enemies: Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. Breitbart columnists have stood strongly against all three.Read the rest of the letter here.SIGN UP"	['Israel', 'Trump']	[]

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSpeaking in a telephone interview with this reporter, Dershowitz stated:I think we have to be very careful before we accuse any particular individual of being an anti-Semite. The evidence certainly suggests that Mr. Bannon has very good relationships with individual Jews. My former researcher, Joel Pollak, is an Orthodox Jew who takes off the Jewish holidays, who is a committed Jew and a committed Zionist, and he has worked closely with him. He has been supportive of Israel.So, I haven't seen any evidence of personal anti-Semitism on the part of Bannon. I think the (Breitbart) headline about a Conservative Republican being a renegade Jew was ill-advised. But it doesn't suggest to me anti-Semitism. It suggests to me a degree of carelessness.I think the larger problem - and it's a very complicated one today - is how you assess a person who himself might not have negative characteristics, but who has widespread appeal to people who do. And I think that problem exists on the right and the left. I think there are left-wing candidates who appeal to some of the worst bigots on the hard left. Anti-Semites on the hard left. Anti-Israel people on the hard left. And I think the same thing is probably true of some very right-wing conservatives who appeal vertently or inadvertently to people whose values they probably themselves don't agree with.Asked whether the claims against Bannon demean the term ""anti-Semitism,"" Dershowitz replied:I think so. And I think one has to be very careful about using the term anti-Semitic in two ways. One, I don't think anybody should be called or accused of being anti-Semitic unless the evidence is overwhelming. And then the second, more subtle and difficult issue is what about characterizing supporters or people who follow them?  Subtle distinctions have to be made.One has to be concerned about any group, right or left, that has widespread appeal to bigots. And I think they have to look in the mirror and ask themselves why. And that's a legitimate point to make.But it is not legitimate to call somebody an anti-Semite because you might disagree with their policies.  Or because in one instance, like in the Bannon case, an aggrieved wife in a divorce may have said something which he himself has denied having said. I think you always have to have a presumption of innocence and of good faith. And so, I am not prepared to accept those conclusions based on the evidence that I have now seen.Bannon, Breitbart's former executive chairman, was named by President-elect Donald Trump earlier this week as the chief strategist of the new White House administration.Yesterday, Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) President Morton A. Klein released a statement calling the anti-Semitism claims ""painful"" while describing Bannon as a defender of Israel:It is painful to see Anti-Defamation League (ADL) president Jonathan Greenblatt engaging in character assassination against President-elect Trump's appointee Stephen Bannon and Mr. Bannon's company, Breitbart media. ADL/Greenblatt essentially accused Mr. Bannon and his media company of ""anti-Semitism"" and Israel hatred, when Jonathan Greenblatt/ADL tweeted that Bannon ""presided over the premier website of the 'alt right' - a loose-knit group of white nationalists and anti-Semites."" ...ZOA's own experience and analysis of Breitbart articles confirms Mr. Bannon's and Breitbart's friendship and fair-mindedness towards Israel and the Jewish people. To accuse Mr. Bannon and Breitbart of anti-Semitism is Orwellian. In fact, Breitbart bravely fights against anti-Semitism. Here are a few of the many examples:Stephen Bannon joined ZOA in fighting the anti-Semitic rallies at CUNY by requiring his Breitbart reporters to call CUNY officials and Gov. Cuomo aides urging them to do something about it.Mark Levin took to his radio show on Monday to argue that the allegations of anti-Semitism against Bannon are ""absolutely ridiculous.""This reporter made similar remarks, telling BuzzFeed: ""These smears are laughable to anyone who knows Bannon, a committed patriot who is deeply concerned about the growing threats to Israel. He has been particularly concerned with the dangerous trend of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel sentiment on U.S. college campuses. While at Breitbart, he pitched countless articles on these and other themes in defense of the Jewish state.""Breitbart's Joel Pollak stated: ""I have worked with Stephen K. Bannon, President-elect Donald Trump's new chief strategist and senior counselor, for nearly six years at Breitbart News. I can say, without hesitation, that Steve is a friend of the Jewish people and a defender of Israel, as well as being a passionate American patriot and a great leader.""Pollak pointed to his ""credentials"" to comment on the matter: ""I am an Orthodox Jew, and I hold a Master of Arts degree in Jewish Studies. My thesis at the Isaac and Jesse Kaplan Centre at the University of Cape Town dealt with the troubled status of Jews in an increasingly anti-Israel, and anti-Semitic, post-apartheid South Africa. I believe myself to be a qualified judge of what is, and is not, anti-Semitic.""Pollak asserted it ""defies logic that a man who was a close friend, confidant, and adviser to the late Andrew Breitbart -- a proud Jew -- could have any negative feelings towards Jews.""""As I can testify from years of work together with Steve in close quarters, the opposite is the case: Steve is outraged by anti-Semitism. If anything, he is overly sensitive about it, and often takes offense on Jews' behalf.""Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

The Democratic presidential nominee, anticipating the postelection reaction of many of her supporters, began shouting profanities, banging tables, and turning objects not nailed down into projectiles.""Sources have told The American Spectator that on Tuesday night, after Hillary realized she had lost, she went into a rage,"" R. Emmett Tyrrell reports. ""Secret Service officers told at least one source that she began yelling, screaming obscenities, and pounding furniture. She picked up objects and threw them at attendants and staff. She was in an uncontrollable rage.""The appearance of campaign chairman John Podesta at Manhattan's Javitz Center, and the dematerialization of his heretofore ubiquitous charge, perplexed in the first hours of Wednesday.""They're still counting votes, and every vote should count,"" Podesta declared to a sad and stunned hall. ""Several states are too close to call, so we're not going to have anything more to say tonight.""As Podesta recalcitrantly refused to recognize reality early Wednesday morning, Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump to offer congratulations. The juxtaposition of the campaign chairman publicly vowing to fight around the time the candidate privately conceded the election left observers scratching their heads.Tyrrell's reporting indicates that Mrs. Clinton's mental state made it impossible for her to address her supporters on election night as custom requests. So, instead, Podesta gave a rah-rah speech on a boo-hoo night to cover for the absence of the first woman president, her fireworks, and her victory speech shout-outs to the mothers of the Black Lives Matter martyrs.""She is not done yet,"" Podesta claimed. Tyrrell's reporting indicates that, indeed, Clinton remained far from done.""Her aides could not allow her to come out in public,"" he writes. ""It would take her hours to calm down. So Podesta went out and gave his aimless speech. I wish we could report on Bill's whereabouts but we cannot.""Bill appeared the following day at Hillary's belated concession speech wearing a purple tie but, thankfully, no purple marks about his face, suggesting experience dictated avoidance the previous evening.""People say they're amazed Bill's marriage survived,"" Tyrrell noted to Breitbart. ""I'm amazed Bill survived his marriage.""Tyrrell's reporting remains a thorn in the side of the Clintons more than two decades after the American Spectator published its Troopergate stories detailing Bill Clinton's escapades as told by his Arkansas security detail, stories that first referenced Paula Jones and pushed the president on the road to impeachment. Nearly 19 years after Hillary Clinton imagined a ""vast, right-wing conspiracy"" out to get her husband, the cabal's charter member again relies on the accounts of the Clintons' long-suffering security to unmask the public faces worn by the power couple now out of power.""In the '90s, we published several pieces that documented her throwing lamps and books,"" Tyrrell tells Breitbart. ""This happened pretty often. She has such a foul mouth that the Arkansas state troopers learned a thing or two from her. She has a foul mouth and a good throwing arm.""SIGN UP"	['Jones', 'Clinton', 'Black', 'Trump']	[]

Steve King of Iowa took the lead in the fight to secure our borders. That's why I know he is the perfect candidate to lead the Department of Homeland Security.""It continues:During his tenure in Congress, Rep. Steve King has been a leading voice for securing America's border; and Rep. Steve King has been vocal in his opposition to Barack Obama's stated plan of bringing Syrian Refugees into America; and Rep. Steve King has been at the forefront of the terrorism issue, urging his colleagues to take necessary precautions to defend American lives.King said if he were contacted by President-elect Donald Trump's transition team for the position, he would consider it.""It is something I would consider and I would want to have the conversation with them of course and be able to discuss ideas and expectations,"" King explained to Breitbart News, adding:Donald Trump's immigration policy is almost an exact mirror of my immigration policy. I built a wall on the floor of the House of Representatives with a model that we built here to demonstrate how it can be done and I have spent my life in the construction business. I know how to build. Also, I've spent a fair amount of time on the border and I have personally been involved in detaining drug smugglers and unloading illegal drugs on that border. I've been personally involved in building a wall -- a fence and a wall -- and I've been deeply engaged in immigration policy of 14 years here in Congress.""Much of the immigration policy that is on Donald Trump's website -- some of that originated here, so I think we see exactly eye to eye on immigration policy,"" King added.During his tenure in Congress, Rep.

Bannon, President-elect Donald Trump's chief strategist and senior counselor. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom The Hill:Bannon is best known for his domestic positions, particularly his populist nationalist views on trade and immigration.

Sources who know Bannon say he's likely be an influential adviser to Trump in the international arena.Sources close to Bannon say the best way to understand his approach to foreign affairs is to observe the structure and content of Breitbart News.

He wants to work more closely with them and sees them as part of a worldwide movement to overthrow the ""globalists,"" according to multiple sources familiar with his thinking....""He definitely recognizes populist nationalists around the world,"" said a source close to Bannon. ""He noticed that before most people did.""""Mostly he'll be focusing on an America-first foreign policy, taking care of America's interests in whatever negotiation the country is engaged in,"" the source added.Read the rest here.
