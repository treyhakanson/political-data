Many of Obama's unconstitutional actions have been invalidated by the Supreme Court, such as his recess appointments when the U.S. Senate was not in recess, which the justices unanimously ruled against in NLRB v. Noel Canning.Others are found in federal laws--such as Obamacare's individual mandate, wrongly upheld 5-4 in NFIB v. Sebelius by declaring it a tax--and therefore can only be rescinded by Congress' changing the statute.But some are executive actions that are still in force. The clearest example is Obama's executive amnesty for illegal aliens, which a federal appeals court invalidated on statutory grounds, and which was indefinitely put on ice when the Supreme Court deadlocked on the case in U.S. v. Texas. But the DAPA program--like its predecessor DACA (which applied to the children)--also violates the Constitution's Take Care Clause because the president rewrote federal law, which the Constitution assigns exclusively to Congress.Another is Obama's ""transgender directive."" For years the Far Left has tried to push legislation like ENDA (the Employment Non-Discrimination Act), which would amend iconic laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make sexual orientation and gender identity specially protected classes in this nation on the same level as race.The Obama administration has redefined the term ""sex"" in Title VII and Title IX--which make it illegal for employers and schools to discriminate on the basis of sex--to include gender identity. This redefinition allows male high school students and even adults (such as teachers) to share bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers with high school girls at the same time girls are using that facility, so long as the male says he identifies as a female on that day.Half the states of the nation have sued in federal court and won a major court victory, because it is clear that Congress' using the word ""sex"" refers to biological sex. (The Justice Department is currently appealing that ruling.) Obama's order to the contrary is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, because only Congress can make laws.""Second, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia ... from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.""Only a very small handful of lawyers in America could ever fill the shoes of Antonin Scalia, either in terms of being a reliable adherent of Scalia's originalist judicial philosophy, or in terms of matching Scalia's towering intellect.Trump's initial list of 11 potential Supreme Court justices includes several such judges, and his second list of 10 includes a couple more, if you count Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT). Top conservative leaders still hope to see a couple more of the greatest conservative minds of this generation added to the list. Of these, their top choice is Solicitor General Paul Clement, perhaps Scalia's most brilliant and accomplished former law clerk--having repeatedly saved both the Second Amendment and religious liberty before the Supreme Court, and having led the fight against Obamacare--and thus a fitting heir to Scalia's seat on the High Court.Between these choices and the possible addition of a superstar like Clement, Trump could restore the Court to where it stood before Scalia's passing.The last three promises concern immigration:Third, cancel all federal funding for Sanctuary Cities.Fourth, begin moving the more than two million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back.Fifth, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered ""extreme vetting.""All these could trigger legal challenges from liberals, but Trump's actions on each front are fully constitutional--under the Constitution's Spending Clause, Naturalization Clause, Commander-in-Chief Clause, and Receive Ambassadors Clause--as well as fully consistent with federal law.Each of these actions can be achieved by a legal use of executive orders--which every president since George Washington has used to implement federal law and exercise constitutional powers--on his first day in office, if the American people entrust Donald Trump with the presidency.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

They took one position in May in a brief to the Texas Supreme Court, but some of them are now taking the opposite position when making a decision about paying what could end up being over a million dollars for prosecuting the Texas Attorney General.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERGeneral Paxton was indicted by a Collin County grand jury last summer for two counts of securities fraud and one count for failing to register with the Texas State Securities Board. Breitbart Texas has reported about the substance of the charges, the parties and witnesses involved, and the re-indictments after special prosecutors asked for a dismissal of two indictments. The charges are all felonies.The criminal case against Paxton is pending in Collin County, and as reported by Breitbart Texas, two special prosecutors were appointed by then-Local Administrative Judge Scott J. Becker. Becker had the option of utilizing a reciprocity agreement with a number of counties contiguous to Collin County. That option would not have resulted in Collin County taxpayers being saddled with the financial burden of Paxton's prosecution as has been the case with the special prosecutors.Plano lawyer Hiram Sasser, a Collin County resident and taxpayer told Breitbart Texas, ""The reciprocity agreement between counties to provide for prosecutions between counties is routine. There was no reason to spend a penny on this case.""Collin County Commissioner Susan Fletcher asked Judge Becker for an explanation for his uncommon decision and Becker refused to give her an explanation.Sasser added, ""Collin County must follow the law, and they must follow the legal position they took with the Texas Supreme Court in May 2016 when they filed their brief.""The question before the Collin County Commissioners Court is whether they must pay attorneys fees that are the subject of a district judge's order, or whether, to quote the brief filed by Collin County in the Texas Supreme Court in May, doing so ""allows a District Court to impermissibly overreach into the legislative budgeting functions of the Commissioners Court in instances when the District Court simply disagrees with the financial decision of the Commissioners Court."" The case at the Texas Supreme Court involves paying the compensation of a county employee.Here the North Texas County is being hit for $300 an hour for two special prosecutors and another lawyer to prosecute the case involving the Texas AG, as well as the fees to pay another set of lawyers in a civil case filed by a taxpayer. The special prosecutors have been paid at least $254,000, reported the Dallas Morning News on Friday. It has also reported that the cost of the litigation in the taxpayer civil lawsuit has reached over $80,000.Collin County taxpayer Jeffory Blackard filed a lawsuit to challenge paying the special prosecutors. Blackard lives in Hopkins County but also has land in Collin County, reported the Texas Tribune. He was reported to say that the $300 an hour fees ""'would constitute an illegal expenditure of taxpayer funds' because they would eclipse fees typically paid to attorneys appointed to represent poor defendants.""In saying that Collin County officials have taken conflicting legal positions, Sasser referred to the County's brief filed in a case styled The Honorable Mark Henry, County Judge of Galveston County v. The Honorable Lonnie Cox, Judge of the 56th District Court of Galveston County, (cause number 15-0992). The amicus curiae (Latin for friend of the court) brief filed on behalf of Collin County can be found at this link and is attached below.Excerpts from the brief argue: Collin County believes the Court of Appeals decision is erroneous insofar as it allows a District Court to impermissibly overreach into the legislative budgeting functions of the Commissioners Court in instances when the District Court simply disagrees with the financial decision of the Commissioners Court involving the compensation of a county employee. Although District Courts have limited powers to exercise supervisory authority over actions of a Commissioners Court, in this instance the undisputed facts reflect no illegal, unreasonable or arbitrary conduct to support the exercise of such authority.Unwarranted interference by the judiciary into fiscal decisions made by the Commissioners Court threatens the separation of powers between the judicial and legislative branches of county government. Such interference erodes the powers and statutory duties of the Commissioners Court regarding the control and expenditure of County funds, and if such interference is allowed to stand, could plausibly result in a dramatic shift power to the judicial branch.Moreover, such actions remove the taxpayers from having any input or voice in the political process. Rather, the decisions of the District Court, as evidenced in this instance, were made at the District Court's sole discretion and without any rights afforded to the public to participate. Further, the Court of Appeals decision conflicts with legal precedent, including opinions of this Court. The much reported on case began in Galveston County when a district court judge signed an order requiring Galveston County Judge Mark Henry to reinstate the employment of Bonita Quiroga as the Director of Justice Administration. The legal brief filed by counsel for Galveston County Judge Mark Henry in the State's highest court cites a 1992 Texas Supreme Court case holding ""while the district court may order the commissioners court to carry out its constitutional duty to set a reasonable salary, the district court cannot substitute its discretion for that of the commissioners by making that determination itself.""The Texas Association of Counties, the County of El Paso, Bexar County, Brazoria County, the Texas Conference of Urban Counties, and Harris County, among others, also filed briefs in support of Galveston County Judge Mark Henry.Hiram Sasser shared his opinion with County Judge Keith Self in a comment to Self's Facebook post of October 11th.As can be seen from his post, Sasser told the County Judge ""You have an obligation to test the legal legitimacy of a questionable order. And the order is in violation of state law."" Sasser then cites Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 2.07(c) governing the appointment of an attorney pro tem (pro tempore or temporary). It provides, ""(c) If the appointed attorney is not an attorney for the state, he is qualified to perform the duties of the office for the period of absence or disqualification of the attorney for the state on filing an oath with the clerk of the court. He shall receive compensation in the same amount and manner as an attorney appointed to represent an indigent person.""Sasser linked the Collin County Indigent Defense Plan to his post, http://www.collincountytx.gov/.../Documents/Felony_TFDA.pdf, and said the ""maximum you can authorize, by law, for the payment of pre-trial preparation in this matter is $1,000. So far you have authorized hundreds of thousands of dollars illegally.""The lawyer from Collin County also said in his comment to the County Judge's Facebook post, ""Continuing to do so just because one judge ordered such is no excuse. You have an obligation to appeal the order to the Dallas Court of Appeals. If the appellate court agrees, then it is debatable whether you must appeal further. But continuing to authorize the payment without appealing the questionable order is simply not defensible. And it should not matter who the person is being prosecuted. The reason we have an appellate process in this country is to preserve freedom and ensure fairness is not arbitrarily dismissed based on the opinion of a single person. I believe this should be the standard regardless of who is involved.""Breitbart Texas was told that there is a $1,000 cap on attorney fees for pretrial matters unless there is an exception. The cap where there is an exception is $2,000. In capital murder death penalty cases attorneys are paid $150 an hour, and in capital murder cases not involving the death penalty, they are $100 an hour.""If anyone votes for further paying these bills, then I believe they must send a letter to the Texas Supreme Court and tell the justices they made a false statement to them. A vote to pay these bills is completely inconsistent with the position that they took in their official capacities with the Texas Supreme Court just a few months ago,"" Sasser told Breitbart Texas.Conservative Republican elected officials in Collin County have been concerned about the fees and were apparently planning to discuss the matter with county officials. They were the subject of an open record request for their text messages, reported the Dallas Morning News. The Morning News reported that Texas State Representative Matt Shaheen (R-Plano) texted, ""I'll ask Keith [Self] if they lowered the fees and discuss options to stop payment."" ""Perfect,"" Rep. Jeff Leach (R-Plano) texted back. ""Let him know we are here to help -- not hurt. If Keith got sent to jail for this -- I'd be the first to bail him out."" State Rep. Scott Sanford (R-McKinney) and State Senator Van Taylor (R-Plano) were on the text string but were reported to have said little during the conversation. Rep. Jodie Laubenberg (R-Parker) wrote, ""I'm just asking what is best method. I am not going to start attacking fellow republicans until I have all the information."" The texts were sent in October.""Ken Paxton has always proved himself to be a man of integrity to me, and it's clear that the charges against him are politically motivated,"" Rep. Shaheen said in a statement to the Morning News. ""Any resources spent on this case are a waste of the government's time and a drain of taxpayer money.""Rep. Leach was reported to say, ""There are substantive concerns and legitimate questions about the application of Texas law in this situation, and taxpayers deserve clear answers. Especially in light of the recent dismissal of the federal charges brought against General Paxton, I strongly believe that every avenue should be explored before Collin County citizens are forced to write a blank check to continue to fund this politically driven prosecution. I will never apologize for fighting for justice and for the taxpayers, as they expect, demand and deserve for me to be their voice.""Precinct One Commissioner Susan Fletcher sent an email newsletter with the heading ""YOUR MONEY: Status of Special Prosecutors Payments."" In it she wrote, ""I have consistently voted 'no' and will continue to do so, unless I am compelled directly by a higher court to pay them.""While I respect my colleagues, our own Collin County judiciary, and the authority of Judge Gallagher, the District Judge from Tarrant County overseeing the Paxton case, I continue to question the appropriateness and legitimacy of these expenditures, due to what I believe is an arbitrary and capricious hourly rate set by a singular District Judge from Collin County, which is in direct conflict with the Collin County Indigent Defense Policy in place at the time of the special prosecutors' appointments.She added, ""From the beginning, I have advocated for the Commissioners Court to contest these orders by appealing to the Fifth District Court of Appeals.  In doing so, we would have legally ""tested"" the legitimacy of the orders - and if the court didn't agree with us, we would have been able to SHOW the taxpayers of Collin County that we have exhausted all of our options prior to paying the bills.""The next meeting of the Collin County Commissioners Court is on Monday, October 24th at 1:30 p.m.Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

In August rebels briefly broke through this government-held strip of land to try to break a siege on rebel-held eastern Aleppo enacted in July.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was heavy rebel shelling onto the government-controlled Hamdaniya district, part of this battle front.Syrian or Russian air strikes hit a number of rebel-held areas just west of Aleppo city from dawn on Sunday. Air raids also hit north of Aleppo and deeper into west Aleppo countryside, the Observatory said.Aleppo has been a major battleground in the Syrian conflict, now in its sixth year. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by the Russian military, Iran's Revolutionary Guards and an array of Shi'ite Muslim militias, wants to take full control of the city.Russia had declared a unilateral ceasefire from Thursday which was rejected by rebels, lasted three days and did not result in hoped-for medical evacuations from the city or aid deliveries.Air strikes within the city stopped for three days, but resumed late on Saturday as the third day of the truce expired.The Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel alliance, which has said it is preparing for a big attack to break the siege of eastern Aleppo, warned residents in and around the city to stay away from Syrian government military buildings for their own safety in a statement on Saturday.FSA rebel groups said in statements they had repelled various offensives by government and allied forces along the frontline separating rebel- from government-held Aleppo city late on Saturday.SIGN UP	[]	[]

A year after Harrison began asking the aforementioned questions, Bill Clinton was warning the foundation's senior staff that he will resign from the Clinton Foundation board and cease giving paid speeches if Hillary Clinton wins the White House in November, and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the Clinton foundation's flagship project, announced plans to spin off into a ""completely independent"" charity.In response to swirling controversies surrounding her family foundation, Hillary Clinton skipped the 2016 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) conference in September, marking the second year in a row that she failed to show up for the star-studded three-day event that puts celebrities, business leaders, and philanthropists in close proximity.Last month, a public opinion poll found that a majority of Americans believe Bill and Hillary Clinton failed to avoid conflicts of interest as millions of dollars flowed into their corrupt family foundation.Harrison went on to explain the ""issues"" that he and Podesta ""need to address if HRC is President.""""Can WJC invite members to, and host, CGI events?"" Harrison wrote, referring to former Presidential Bill Clinton. ""Can CGI hold the kind of events we have historically held?

Cleveland was the town that hosted the 2016 GOP nominating convention and the crowd was extremely enthusiastic to see their nominee once again.Before Trump took the stage, several other speakers addressed those gathered, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and GOP vice presidential nominee and Indiana Governor Mike Pence. But another speaker whose voice was heard this night was Brook Park, Ohio Mayor Tom Coyne, a lifelong Democrat who has endorsed Trump.Mayor Coyne is particularly supportive of Trump's pledge to bring jobs back to the U.S., as his town has been decimated by job loss.""Northeast Ohio has been decimated for the last 15, 20 years and continues to bleed manufacturing jobs and you cannot have a middle class being revived in this country unless you make things in America again,"" Mayor Coyne recently said.Once Trump took the stage ,he promised that ""In seventeen days, we're going to win the White House.""The GOP nominee then promised to ""deliver real change that puts America first.""Trump noted that thousands and thousands of jobs were lost in Cleveland and that once he takes the White House he will end government corruption and put a halt to ""the powerful protecting the powerful.""Trump noted that during his Gettysburg address he talked about ""the issue of government corruption. I talked about the inside dealing, the powerful protecting the powerful, and about special interests and donors who've rigged the system.""""I've got news for all of the people taking advantage of our rigged system,"" Trump told the cheering crowd, ""In seventeen days, everything is going to change. In seventeen days we are going to drain the swamp in Washington D.C.""With that proclamation, the crowd went wild shouting ""Trump, Trump, Trump.""Trump went on to note that he is going to ""put those miners back to work"" and revive the coal industry that Barack Obama has purposefully destroyed. The nominee also promised to eliminate Obama's key legislation known as Obamacare.""Hillary Clinton wants to double down and make Obamacare bigger and worse,"" Trump warned his supporters to a wall of boos for Obama's failed healthcare plan. ""Just this month, the Democratic governor of Minnesota admitted, 'the reality is, the Affordable Care Act,' he said, 'is no longer affordable.' He said that. And you probably saw last week, Bill Clinton called Obamacare the craziest thing in the world.""The real estate mogul noted that even Bill Clinton said that small business and the middle class are getting killed by Obamacare.Trump went on to insist that he would bring back jobs to America but not before another protester tried to disrupt the rally.""Is he one of the people paid for by the Democrats and the Clinton campaign? Are you paid,"" he asked the disrupter. ""Get out of here, get out,"" Trump insisted.""Did you read that the other day,"" Trump added as the protester was removed from the hall. ""They're paid $1,500,"" he said of the protesters who have tried so desperately to break up his many rallies. ""They're violent, they want to have violence, and everybody blamed it on me and now they're saying, 'guess what -- Trump was actually innocent.'""Later in the rally the GOP nominee also noted that a man who was responsible for funding paid protesters at Trump rallies visited the White House over 340 times. Trump was referring to Democratic operative Robert Creamer, who was exposed in a recent undercover video as the man responsible for fielding a large number of fake protesters paid for by the Democrat Party.Trump hit many themes, including the corruption of Bill and Hillary Clinton, her plan to raise taxes on the middle class, and Hillary's email scandals.The GOP leader ended his rally praising his supporters and saying, ""This is a movement like no one in this country has ever seen before. We have a big crowd today, but we have big crowds everywhere.""""We're seventeen days away from the change we've been waiting for our entire lives,"" Trump said to the cheers of the crowd.The rally in Cleveland came on the heels of Trump's address in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania where he reportedly spoke before an incredible 50,000 supporters.SIGN UP"	['Pence', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	['healthcare']

Gun sales continued to surge and the ""firearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide"" rate fell to 3.2 in 2011.Think about it-as gun ownership rose, the murder rate plummeted in the U.S. Couple that with the fact that only one of the Top 10 countries for gun ownership is also in the Top 10 for firearm-related deaths-Uruguay is number eight for gun ownership number 10 for gun deaths-and the point is clear: More guns correlate with less crime.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

There is a tremendous amount of potential in these inter Faith orgs including the ability to reach some working class voters,FredThe forwarded message is from Ben Palumbo, a CACG board member, who wrote on the subject of ""Catholic Efforts on Iran Update"" to Diane Randall and members of the Quakers (Friends) political lobbying organization, CACG's Hale, and James Salt of Catholics United, another leftwing dissident group that calls itself ""Catholic.""Palumbo wrote about plans to meet with several Democrat U.S. senators:Hi Diane,I wanted you to see this report from our Exec. Dir. Chris Hale.We are going to seek a meeting with Warner, and requests are in the works for Coons and Casey.Best wishes,BenThe report, from Hale, first announces CACG's ad to support the Iran Treaty that is running on leftwing ""Catholic"" sites National Catholic Reporter and Commonweal.Hale wrote:Our advertisement began running on National Catholic Reporter and Commonweal yesterday. Right now, when you click the advertisement, the link takes you to MoveOn's 60 Day to Stop A War Take Action website. From there, you are able to dial into your Member of Congress and request them to support the Iran Deal.At some point today, that link will change to our own website, which will list all the groups' names, simple talking points, and give people a chance to dial in three elected officials (their one US Representatives and two Senators). While the MoveOn site is very effective, ours will ensure that people calling into the offices identify as a person of faith, which is important in both our narrative creation (Catholics support the deal) and coalition building (the God Squad takes action).Hale then pointed out that his organization is working on letters to Democrat U.S. Sens. Benjamin Cardin and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, to urge them to vote for the Iran deal.He continued that CACG was planning to meet with Baltimore Archbishop William Lori and Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C., to encourage them to urge the Maryland senators to vote for the Iran Treaty as well:The letters to both Senators Cardin and Mikulski have been e-mailed, faxed, and snail mailed to the appropriate parties. This morning, I will make follow up calls to the state chief of staffs and schedulers. I imagine we'll know early next week if they plan on meeting with our groups' representatives. If it appears that isn't the case, I'm developing a grass-tops digital strategy and local media strategy to encourage them to change their minds...I have phone calls early next week with senior advocacy staffers for the Archdiocese of Baltimore, Archdiocese of Washington (which includes territory in Maryland), and the Maryland Catholic Conference.While I think there should be many goals for these meetings, I think the top-line goal is pretty clear: we need Archbishop William Lori and Cardinal Donald Wuerl to make direct appeals to Senators Cardin and Mikulski on this issue. While I don't have any advance knowledge, I have a sense from the conversations setting up the meetings that there might be willingness for that to happen.I will be sending an additional e-mail to our C4 community on Tuesday to asking them to contact their Members of Congress. This was remarkably successful last week. Based on the digital metrics, we can safely assume thousands of our Catholic brothers and sisters are taking action on this issue. My colleagues will be working with our allies to scan the local newspapers this upcoming week to see if people are communicating faith values in supporting the deal to letters to the editors in newspapers across the nation. My initial sense is that they are.

I thought you might be interested in this report from the CACG exec director Chris Hale on efforts to have the Catholic org community promote the Iran Treaty. There is a tremendous amount of potential in these inter Faith orgs including the ability to reach some working class voters,
FredHi Diane,
I wanted you to see this report from our Exec. Dir. Chris Hale.
We are going to seek a meeting with Warner, and requests are in the works for Coons and Casey.
Best wishes,
BenOur advertisement began running on National Catholic Reporter and Commonweal yesterday. Right now, when you click the advertisement, the link takes you to MoveOn's 60 Day to Stop A War Take Action website. From there, you are able to dial into your Member of Congress and request them to support the Iran Deal.
At some point today, that link will change to our own website, which will list all the groups' names, simple talking points, and give people a chance to dial in three elected officials (their one US Representatives and two Senators). While the MoveOn site is very effective, ours will ensure that people calling into the offices identify as a person of faith, which is important in both our narrative creation (Catholics support the deal) and coalition building (the God Squad takes action).The letters to both Senators Cardin and Mikulski have been e-mailed, faxed, and snail mailed to the appropriate parties. This morning, I will make follow up calls to the state chief of staffs and schedulers. I imagine we'll know early next week if they plan on meeting with our groups' representatives. If it appears that isn't the case, I'm developing a grass-tops digital strategy and local media strategy to encourage them to change their minds...
I have phone calls early next week with senior advocacy staffers for the Archdiocese of Baltimore, Archdiocese of Washington (which includes territory in Maryland), and the Maryland Catholic Conference.
While I think there should be many goals for these meetings, I think the top-line goal is pretty clear: we need Archbishop William Lori and Cardinal Donald Wuerl to make direct appeals to Senators Cardin and Mikulski on this issue. While I don't have any advance knowledge, I have a sense from the conversations setting up the meetings that there might be willingness for that to happen.
I will be sending an additional e-mail to our C4 community on Tuesday to asking them to contact their Members of Congress. This was remarkably successful last week. Based on the digital metrics, we can safely assume thousands of our Catholic brothers and sisters are taking action on this issue. My colleagues will be working with our allies to scan the local newspapers this upcoming week to see if people are communicating faith values in supporting the deal to letters to the editors in newspapers across the nation. My initial sense is that they are. That would be something to be proud of for our group.
I'll be taking some time off on both today and Monday to rejuvenate myself as my colleagues and I continue our grueling preparation for Pope Francis's apostolic trip to the US. As you can imagine, Iran is just a portion of the work we're doing in preparation for the Holy Father's trip...
I spoke to the White House yesterday and they assure us the media's moniker calling us ""God Squad"" isn't just sweet nothings, but actually a fair assessment of the substantial difference we're making in this conversation.

Marsha Blackburn (R.-Tenn.), who sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Blackburn said she met a young, female Clinton supporter, who told her that she was voting for the former first lady because she supports pay equality based on gender.""It is so interesting because I asked her if she had ever looked at how Hillary Clinton paid her own staff when she was in the Senate or if she had looked at what she paid at the Clinton Foundation and she had not,"" she said.The congresswoman told the Clinton supporter that Clinton had paid women less than men for equal job assignments.These pay differences are documented in a report in LifeZette.""You know, I also told her the way to be certain you're going to get paid more or equal to, based on your performance, is to show up and to work hard,"" she said. ""Prove your point. Go in there and be aggressive.""Blackburn said a way to help women is for corporations to have more women on their boards of directors.Women serving at the top levels of corporate governance would serve as watchdogs to make sure gender equality was practiced, she said.The congresswoman said her own experience in the private sector taught her that there is no magic wand that fixes problems-as people who have never worked in private business seem to believe.All women should be active in changing the workplace culture, so that women are treated fairly, she said.""Be your own best advocate,"" she said.

Blackburn: Hillary Clinton’s Russian ‘Pay-to-Play’ Uranium Scheme Top Example of Her Corruption	"A senior Tennessee Republican congresswoman told Breibart News Saturday the dealings between the State Department led by Hillary R. Clinton, Russia, and the Clinton Foundation are a prime example of how the Clintons established a unique business model that brokered government decisions and made them fabulously wealthy.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""They're the ones who have been dealing with the Russians,"" said Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R.-Tenn.) to Breitbart Radio host Matthew Boyle in a live interview on the SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 program.Blackburn was referring to the attention the media has given supposed ties between the Russian government and Clinton's GOP rival Donald J. Trump.An example of how the linkage came to be is seen in an Dec. 21, 2015 email from former Democratic Capitol Hill aide and columnist Brent Budowsky to John Podesta, the chairman of Clinton's presidential campaign:Odds that Putin agrees to remove Assad are only slightly better than the odds the College of Cardinals chooses me to someday succeed Pope Francis.
Best approach is to slaughter Donald for his bromance with Putin, but not go too far betting on Putin re Syria.

Sent from my iPadThe claims by Clinton that Trump was a puppet of the Russians were more than a media spin-it was also a kind of confession, she said.""I have finally figured it out,"" she said. ""If you want to know what the Clintons have inappropriately done, just listen to what they rail against, because that is the path that they will have traveled.""The congresswoman, who is the vice-chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said that when Clinton was the secretary of state, she approved the Uranium One transaction that gave a Russian company up to 25 percent of America's deposits of that vital mineral. ""They now have control of part of our uranium.""Blackburn told Boyle to look at the dealings of Frank Giustra, who is a member of the Clinton Foundation board of directors and a shareholder in Uranium One. Giustra gave more than $30 million to the Clinton Foundation.There have been other arrangements, Blackburn said, such at President William J. ""Bill"" Clinton's $18 million contract to serve as the honorary chairman of the Laureate International Universities, a for-profit college.The Clinton's even leveraged their role in supporting victims of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, she said.""Then, you look at the Haiti Relief Corporation, which I thought it was quite interestingly was named the H-R-C-the email traffic shows that they sought favors for 'Friends of Bill's,'"" she said. ""Even the head of the Haitian Senate during that time accused Mrs. Clinton of trying to seek favors in 'the gold rush,' as they described it in Haiti.""Correspondence revealed by hackers and other sources demonstrate the way the Clinton Foundation acted as the go-between and cash window, facilitating State Department policies and decisions for interested parties, she said. Many donors to the Clinton Foundation were also given access at the State Department.Originally, the Clinton Foundation was set up to support the Clinton Presidential Library and Museum, she said.But, in its actual operations, the foundation took on its international programs without proper changes to status approved by the IRS, which oversees non-profits, she said.The pay-for-play arrangements come after Clinton told Congress upon her nomination to lead the State Department that she promised President Barack Obama that she would avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest, she said.Sixty countries made donations to the Clinton Foundation, who were also dealing with the State Department, which was a direct violation of the pledge Clinton made when she took office, she said.""They just did not abide by that,"" she said.""All of that, Matt, is substantiated,"" she said. ""It is not hearsay. It's not conjecture. You see the emails. When you look at the emails that have been released and then you look at who has donated to the Clinton Foundation. You look at who had appointments with Mrs. Clinton and you see the evidence that there was a pay-for-play-type structure.""The Tennessean told Boyle if you look at the record of the former first lady, wherever you look, you find deceit. ""There is lie after lie after lie.""All of it comes together as Clinton says one thing in public and in the shadows pursues her own quest for power and wealth, she said.How else? she asked, could a couple, who invented nothing, built nothing, invested nothing, nor offered in the private market any product or service become so wealthy?""In a period of 14 years, they went from being self-described as 'dead broke' to being worth a quarter of a billion dollars?"" she asked.""That's what my constituents want to know.""Odds that Putin agrees to remove Assad are only slightly better than the odds the College of Cardinals chooses me to someday succeed Pope Francis.

And Reuters reports an amnesty will be put in place in 2017 where those in possession of said weapons can turn them in with no questions asked.Justice Minister Michael Keenan summarized:The amnesty will provide an opportunity for those individuals who, for whatever reason are in possession of an unregistered firearm, to hand it in without fear of being prosecuted. While Australia has some of the strongest firearm controls in the world, illicit firearms remain the weapon of choice for criminals.It is interesting to note that Hillary Clinton praised Australia's original gun confiscation scheme during an October 16, 2015, town hall, describing it as ""worth looking at"" for policy in the U.S. Yet the example of Melbourne-and now the whole of Australia-proves anew that banning guns disarms law-abiding citizens while criminals remain armed.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

Trump, the Republican nominee for president, is in a unique position to be able to tell the Wall Street lobbyists and special interests to ""go to hell"" while he actually fixes the U.S. economy, his senior economic adviser Peter Navarro told Breitbart News Saturday.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNavarro said on the program, which aired on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday:The basic problem is for a congressman or a president to get elected, they need obscene amounts of money. And the only place you can get obscene amounts of money is from Wall Street and the big corporations who benefit from shipping our jobs and our factories overseas--that's the fundamental political problem. That's the beauty of Donald Trump. He's the change agent. He can tell Wall Street and these big people and corporations that want to ship our jobs overseas to go to hell. He stands up for our workers.Navarro's interview came just an hour before Trump's address in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where he laid out what he will do in his first 100 days as president if elected on Nov. 8, and made his closing argument to the American people in the campaign.Navarro told Breitbart News Saturday of the speech:This is basically a broad overview of the whole Trump policy agenda for America. It's very exciting news. If you think about what's going on this year in America, we've got the slowest growth since World War II. We've got a national security mess in every theater in the world from Asia to the Middle East, and we've got a healthcare plan that is imploding, and we've got an immigration plan that is overwhelming this country, so in the remaining days until Nov. 8 Mr. Trump is going to lay all of this out and it's going to be exciting to hear positive policies talked about to the American people instead of anything but policy.Trump, Navarro noted, has been giving detailed policy-oriented speeches across the United States over the past several months while his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton has been running a policy-free campaign focused on insults and the politics of personal destruction. Nonetheless, the media completely ignores Trump's solutions-focused campaign. So what Trump plans to do now is circumvent the media while taking his message directly to the American people. Navarro said:What happens is there will be a major speech that goes on for 40 minutes laying out in precise detail exactly what's going to get done and then the media will take a clip from that that's unrelated to the policy agenda and make that the news. It's difficult to push through that when so much of the media has a NeverTrump agenda. So what Mr. Trump's going to do is just take the case to the American people between now and election day that his agenda is the right one on the economy, immigration, healthcare, and everything on down--national security--this is a critical election.Hillary Clinton's agenda, Navarro said, would devastate the United States on every front. He said:In fact, if we turn the country over to Hillary Clinton at this point we know the following: We know that she can't possibly be better at economically than we've been doing and she'll probably do worse. We know that she will continue with the Obamacare agenda which is collapsing before our eyes. We know that Hillary Clinton's foreign policy agenda will continue to be weakness and chaos in places like the Middle East. We know all of this and it's important for the American people to learn more in more granular detail about the competing policies of each of the candidates and that's the mission between now and Nov. 8.One of the key points he brought up during the interview was Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the United States, which since the early 2000s has significantly slowed down compared with the latter half of the 20th century. That crushes Americans' chances of getting a good job with high-paying wages, as the slowdown in the 21st century has cost the United States around 20 million jobs, maybe more. Navarro went on:Let me give you just the central statistic of American life right now: From 1947 to 2001, our economy grew at an average rate of 3.5 percent a year. Since 2002, that rate's fallen to 1.9 percent a year. For every one percent of GDP growth that we have lost over the last 15 years, we've lost 1.2 million jobs. If you add that up over the 15-year period, that would be over 20 million jobs, which is about what we need to put everybody back to work at a decent wage. So that's the grim reality.Navarro said the reason this has happened is because of a ""structural problem"" in the U.S. economy that people like Hillary Clinton refuse to solve:Now, the question is: Why has this happened? The answer is simply that we have a deep structural problem in our economy and the basic answer is we don't invest on American soil like we used to. That's a major problem. We invest in Mexico and China and Vietnam and Cambodia instead. That drains our GDP directly, and then we also run a massive trade deficit: $766 billion a year, which alone probably takes a point off our growth rate. Now, Donald Trump recognizes this. He recognizes that two of the most important things are to get more investment on domestic soil by corporations and businesses and to eliminate the trade deficit.Trump will solve the problem on four separate fronts, Navarro said, something that will take bold leadership and courage in Washington. Navarro continued:So what do you do? You attack that on four different fronts: regulatory, trade directly, energy, and basically what we need to do is realign the incentives of corporations so that it's better to invest in Michigan than Mexico. One of the ways to do that is to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent down to 15 percent, which would make us competitive with all of those countries which have lower corporate tax rates and are basically running huge surpluses with us: Germany, Japan, South Korea, China, Mexico. These are the countries that are just killing us strategically. So, if we want to get better growth--stronger growth--we have to attack this structurally. Now, what Obama and Clinton have been doing is treating the problem not structurally but as a cyclical phenomenon that you can simply use what we call Keynesian stimulus -- named after John Maynard Keynes, famous economist: the idea that if you simply spend a bunch of government money and print a bunch of government money that somehow that will stimulate the economy. Well, we've had eight years of that. Barack Obama has doubled our debt from $10 to $20 trillion using fiscal stimulus and our Federal Reserve balance sheet has been totally destroyed and what do we have to show for it? We have one percent growth instead of 3.5 or 4.Navarro said Clinton has two separate ideas to ""stimulate the economy,"" both of which he said won't work.""One is to basically tax the rich and give the money to everybody else,"" he said, noting that that is essentially classic leftist redistribution of wealth that will ""depress savings and investment from the people who save the most and allow the most investment."" Navarro added:And the other is this wacky thing to significantly raise business taxes to get a pot of money and then build some infrastructure. It might sound good to some people--we definitely need the infrastructure--but the last thing we want to do is reallocate funds in America from the efficient private sector to the less efficient public sector. Trump has an infrastructure plan which will produce twice as much spending without having to raise any taxes. He uses an elegant system of a tax credit to incentivize the private sector to build this stuff.Navarro said the problem is, in addition to cheap labor overseas, a number of government policies that strangle business development in the United States while encouraging offshoring of U.S. companies. He elaborated:Cheap labor is a small part of the problem at work here. If it were only cheap labor, America would be in trouble. Because it's other things too, we have a great chance to turn it around. Here's the problem: Our high corporate tax rate pushes our companies offshore. Our high regulatory burden pushes our companies offshore. To the extent we put our coal miners and oil and gas industry out of business and raise electricity costs and energy costs, that pushes our corporations offshore. To the extent that we allow China to illegally subsidize goods and sell them into this country, that pushes our jobs and factories offshore. To the extent we don't hold the World Trade Organization and Mexico accountable for manipulating the rules of the VAT versus income tax is very injurious to this country.Navarro added that if someone is elected president with the ""will and the intelligence"" to take on the special interests and fix the problems, America can survive this threat. He concluded:All of this stuff is in our hands. It simply takes the will and the intelligence to do it, and the ability to resist the special interests who are on the other side of that equation. Trump will solve this problem, Clinton is part of the problem. In fact, it's extraordinary to me--you cannot name a presidential candidate in history who has singlehandedly through bad trade deals destroyed more American jobs and more American factories than Hillary Clinton. She did NAFTA, she did China's entry into the World Trade Organization, she did the South Korean 2012 deal, every single one of those. We're talking about millions and millions and millions of jobs and just misery in all of the swing states in this election. If anybody is listening to this in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, North Carolina, please recognize that Hillary Clinton bears a major responsibility for whatever misery your state is going through.LISTEN TO PETER NAVARRO'S FULL INTERVIEW ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:The basic problem is for a congressman or a president to get elected, they need obscene amounts of money.

You attack that on four different fronts: regulatory, trade directly, energy, and basically what we need to do is realign the incentives of corporations so that it's better to invest in Michigan than Mexico. One of the ways to do that is to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent down to 15 percent, which would make us competitive with all of those countries which have lower corporate tax rates and are basically running huge surpluses with us: Germany, Japan, South Korea, China, Mexico. These are the countries that are just killing us strategically. So, if we want to get better growth--stronger growth--we have to attack this structurally. Now, what Obama and Clinton have been doing is treating the problem not structurally but as a cyclical phenomenon that you can simply use what we call Keynesian stimulus -- named after John Maynard Keynes, famous economist: the idea that if you simply spend a bunch of government money and print a bunch of government money that somehow that will stimulate the economy. Well, we've had eight years of that. Barack Obama has doubled our debt from $10 to $20 trillion using fiscal stimulus and our Federal Reserve balance sheet has been totally destroyed and what do we have to show for it? We have one percent growth instead of 3.5 or 4.And the other is this wacky thing to significantly raise business taxes to get a pot of money and then build some infrastructure. It might sound good to some people--we definitely need the infrastructure--but the last thing we want to do is reallocate funds in America from the efficient private sector to the less efficient public sector. Trump has an infrastructure plan which will produce twice as much spending without having to raise any taxes. He uses an elegant system of a tax credit to incentivize the private sector to build this stuff.Cheap labor is a small part of the problem at work here. If it were only cheap labor, America would be in trouble. Because it's other things too, we have a great chance to turn it around. Here's the problem: Our high corporate tax rate pushes our companies offshore. Our high regulatory burden pushes our companies offshore. To the extent we put our coal miners and oil and gas industry out of business and raise electricity costs and energy costs, that pushes our corporations offshore. To the extent that we allow China to illegally subsidize goods and sell them into this country, that pushes our jobs and factories offshore. To the extent we don't hold the World Trade Organization and Mexico accountable for manipulating the rules of the VAT versus income tax is very injurious to this country.All of this stuff is in our hands. It simply takes the will and the intelligence to do it, and the ability to resist the special interests who are on the other side of that equation. Trump will solve this problem, Clinton is part of the problem. In fact, it's extraordinary to me--you cannot name a presidential candidate in history who has singlehandedly through bad trade deals destroyed more American jobs and more American factories than Hillary Clinton. She did NAFTA, she did China's entry into the World Trade Organization, she did the South Korean 2012 deal, every single one of those. We're talking about millions and millions and millions of jobs and just misery in all of the swing states in this election. If anybody is listening to this in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, North Carolina, please recognize that Hillary Clinton bears a major responsibility for whatever misery your state is going through.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	['healthcare']
