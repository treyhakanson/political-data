She wiped a tear as soon as she stood in front of disappointed supporters.One tear -> pic.twitter.com/OoW22Jpz9W-- Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) November 9, 2016""This is painful, and it will be for some time,"" she admitted.A mournful faced Bill Clinton also grimaced, while fighting back tears.""This loss hurts but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it,"" Hillary Clinton said.Clinton was more than two hours late to her speech, as mournful supporters sat and reflected on the loss while waiting.Her Vice Presidential candidate Tim Kaine introduced Clinton and admitted defeat, but quoted the poet William Faulkner.""They killed us, but they ain't whooped us yet,"" he said.Clinton finally re-appeared after she abruptly canceled her scheduled appearance at the Javits Center in Manhattan on election night, unable to face her devastated supporters in a venue they'd chosen for a grand victory.But as she entered the room, her staffers and close supporters clapped wildly.She specifically reached out to young women who supported her, adding that she was proud to serve as their ""champion.""She admitted that she failed to break the proverbial ""glass ceiling"" but appeared hopeful that it would happen soon.""I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will,"" she said.One tear -> pic.twitter.com/OoW22Jpz9W

""Brooklyn,"" he deadpanned, ""we have a problem."" Fifty-three minutes later, commentator David Axelrod admitted: ""This is clearly not the race we expected."" Still later, Van Jones maintained: ""You have people putting children to bed tonight, and they're afraid of breakfast. They're afraid of 'How do I explain this to my children?'""Over at Fox, Juan Williams observed at 11:28: ""There's not a Democrat watching who is not just bewildered but sick to their stomach."" Back on MSNBC, Kristen Welker reported at 1:58 that the Clinton campaign ""has gone dark."" Seven minutes later, over the soundtrack of Katy Perry's ""Roar,"" the network's cameras captured the whimpers of Clinton supporters. They cried and hugged as viewers wondered if MSNBC cut to the sad scene to prevent viewers from spying the sad scene of Rachel Maddow and Eugene Robinson crying and hugging back in the studio.Conservatives watched MSNBC and CNN on the last night of the election season for the same reasons they did not watch MSNBC and CNN for every previous day of the election season. The slanted coverage that normally induces remote-control clicks provided conservatives catharsis and delivered comeuppance on November 8.The media invested not just in a Clinton victory but a Trump humiliation.""Relax, Donald Trump Can't Win,"" a headline at The Nation reassured readers. ""Donald Trump Is Poised to Lose in the Biggest Landslide in Modern American History,"" Damon Linker wrote at The Week. ""I couldn't find a single [Republican] who now thinks they're going to win,"" Bob Schieffer of CBS told Face the Nation in October. He added, ""I'm not sure the Republican Party is going to survive this.""These and other advertisements for incompetence acted as not just this campaign's Florida-goes-for-Al-Gore moments, but conveyed the perpetual Pauline Kael-quality (""I can't believe Nixon won. I don't know anyone who voted for him."") of journalists. People broadcasting from Washington, where Hillary Clinton won 93 percent of the vote, and Manhattan, where 87 percent of ballots announced ""I'm with Her,"" reported with shocked faces that people in other parts of the country cast different ballots than their neighbors.After the media condemned Trump as a bigot and a racist and a sexist and a fascist and a xenophobe, citizens unsurprisingly showed reluctance to tell the media's emissaries surveying them that they supported a bigot and a racist and a sexist and a fascist and a xenophobe lest they attract taunts of bigot and racist and sexist and fascist and xenophobe.The pollsters judged a 6.5 advantage for Hillary in Wisconsin. Trump won the state. The surveys similarly showed a comfortable 3.4 margin of victory for the Democrats in Michigan. Trump won the state. Media number-crunchers lost credibility when Hillary lost the presidency. HuffPost Pollster gave Trump a two percent chance of victory. The Upshot from the New York Times saw Clinton enjoying an 85 percent chance to win. FiveThirtyEight.com's Nate Silver received copious criticism for allowing for a 29 percent chance of a Trump victory. When the men interpreting hard data show soft hearts for this or that candidate, they create candidates, like Donald Trump, who diss and dismiss pollsters and quant nerds. They devalue their profession. Pollsters did that here. So did journalists.There's an I'm-rubber-you're-glue quality to New York magazine putting an unflattering close-up of Donald Trump under the caption ""Loser"" on its cover. The Dewey-Defeats-Truman of a magazine cover strikes as a microcosm of Election 2016. The slanders hurled against Trump by the media bounced back and stuck to them.The more the Fourth Estate attempted to discredit the Republican nominee, the more they discredited themselves. A law of diminishing returns governs media bias. Stridency desirous of influencing viewers instead alienates viewers. Journalists told us who they are when they told us who Donald Trump is. And we considered their counsel with this in mind.Hillary Clinton, who finished her race for the presidency with a lie when her campaign manager vowed to fight just as she called her rival to call it quits, conceded to Donald Trump over the phone before CNN or MSNBC declared a winner in the presidential race. Sometimes those with the most to lose become the last to negotiate a treaty of surrender with reality.SIGN UP"	['Jones', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Williams', 'Nixon']	[]

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom The Hill:Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, had long said the polls were biased against him. His claims -- dismissed and mocked by the experts -- turned out to be true.""It's going to put the polling industry out of business,"" said CNN anchor Jake Tapper. ""It's going to put the voter projection industry out of business.""Going into Election Day, a strong majority of pollsters and election modelers forecast that Democrat Hillary Clinton would coast to victory, with many predicting she would sweep the battlegrounds and win north of 300 electoral votes.The final University of Virginia Center for Politics model had Clinton winning 322 electoral votes to 216 for Trump, with Clinton winning Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- all states that she lost.Liberals lashed out at data guru Nate Silver for giving Trump a 35 percent chance of victory heading into Election Day, claiming he was putting his thumb on the scale for Trump by making the race appear closer than it was.Of the 11 national polls to be released in the final week of the race, only two -- a Los Angeles Times/USC survey and one from IBD/TIPP -- showed Trump with the lead.The L.A. Times survey was criticized as ""experimental"" by industry experts for polling the same pool of people and for the way it weighted black voters.But for the second consecutive presidential cycle, the L.A. Times and IBD/TIPP surveys were among the most accurate, making them the gold standard going forward.Read the rest here. SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Hill']	[]

While virtually the entire media Establishment was predicting Hillary Clinton was on track to win the election, Trump's team remained ""nervous but optimistic,"" in the words of one adviser, that their man would pull off a historic victory. According to the adviser, Florida governor Rick Scott had assured Team Trump that the campaign would ""squeak it out"" in the Sunshine State. ""This election is about winning one state,"" Rudy Giuliani told me. ""If you win Florida, the rest will fall into place.""And it did. Shortly before 11 p.m., the Associated Press called Florida for Trump and the trajectory of the race fundamentally tilted in Trump's direction. ""Humility to Euphoria,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway texted me shortly after the state fell to Trump. ""Our plan was to protect our core four: Iowa, Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio,"" she later said. ""When we protected the core four and saw the numbers in Wisconsin, we thought we could win.""Despite Trumpworld's confidence in the numbers, the candidate himself was anxious. Trump watched the returns from his Trump Tower penthouse. ""He was humble to the very end,"" Conway recalled. ""He kept saying, 'We didn't get it done yet.' Even when the New York Times had us projected at a 50 percent chance of winning, and then 70 percent, and then 90 percent, he said, 'It's not done yet.'""...Trump's advisers arrived at the Hilton and waited for Fox News to call the election. Around 2:30 a.m., Conway's cell phone rang. It was Huma Abedin calling on behalf of her boss, Hillary Clinton. She was ready to concede. ""Hi, Kellyanne, it's Huma. Is Mr. Trump available?"" Abedin said, according to Conway. Conway passed the phone. Conway recalled Trump's end of the conversation: ""He said, 'You're a smart, tough lady and you ran a great campaign. Thank you for calling. I respect you."" Conway said they spoke for about a minute.Read the rest here.SIGN UP"	['Sherman', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""This morning we are closer than ever to defunding our nation's largest abortion vendor, Planned Parenthood; appointing pro-life Supreme Court Justices; and blocking taxpayer funding of abortion by permanently enshrining the Hyde Amendment.""""Our nation rejected a party and a culture that supports not a single restriction on abortion,"" she continues. ""Abortion mattered in this election as it was the most-searched term in regards to the election on Google. The bottom line is this: today's election results give us the momentum we need to achieve our mission of abolishing abortion in our lifetime.""Lila Rose, president and founder of Live Action, says, ""Planned Parenthood has been defeated at the ballot box.""The nation's largest provider of abortions spent more than $30 million to help elect Clinton and pro-abortion politicians.""Despite the millions Planned Parenthood and its allies spent to elect a pro-abortion president and Congress, voters roundly rejected the abortion agenda of Hillary Clinton and the abortion industry that backed her campaign,"" she added. ""When the abortion lobby pushed for unregulated abortions through all nine months of pregnancy and wanted to force taxpayers to pay for them, the American people pushed back.""The Susan B. Anthony List's on-the-ground, door-to-door effort reached 1.6 million ""low-propensity, pro-life voters,"" including Democrats and Hispanics, in an effort to help elect Trump and pro-life Senate candidates that would enable the Republican Party to keep control of that chamber.""Both the presidential race and the control of the Senate came down to tens of thousands of votes in Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina,"" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the group, said following Trump's victory. ""This is an historic moment for the pro-life movement. There are four critical pro-life goals now within our reach: end painful late-term abortions, codify the Hyde Amendment, defund Planned Parenthood, and appoint pro-life Supreme Court Justices.""Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life - which organizes the nation's largest peaceful pro-life protest in Washington, D.C. each year on the anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision - said the election results ""reflect America's pro-life consensus in the House, Senate and Presidency.""She continued:We applaud candidates that took a stand on the most critical human rights issue of today, abortion. We congratulate President-elect Trump on his hard-fought win, as well Vice President-elect Pence, and our friends in Congress. We look forward to working together to fulfill President-elect Trump's campaign promises to ensure pro-life Supreme Court justices, pro-life policies, and defunding America's primary abortion provider, Planned Parenthood. Acknowledging the divisiveness in our country we also commit to working for the day when all Americans know that abortion is unthinkable, and to building a lasting culture of life.The lead investigator of the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) video series that propelled another hard look at Planned Parenthood's activities this past year said, ""Yesterday, the American people voted for change agents to respect and protect even the smallest and most forgotten among us.""David Daleiden added, ""In the past year, CMP's videos exposed Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry's barbaric, taxpayer-sponsored criminal scheme to harvest and sell tiny baby hearts, lungs, livers, and brains for profit.""""We can all now unite around commonsense, consensus pro-life policies and leave behind the failed pro-abortion extremism of the past,"" he said in a statement.Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said, with Trump's election, the country can now ""embark on a path to eliminate abortion and to foster the freedom of the Church.""He continued:In particular, this election victory means the end of the HHS mandate, against which Priests for Life was one of the first groups to launch a challenge in federal court. That challenge, joined by various dioceses and other groups, has gone all the way to the Supreme Court, and is still unresolved. Now, however, we see a bright light at the end of the tunnel.Ardent pro-life leader in the House, Rep. Diane Black (R-TN) won her own re-election bid Tuesday.""Last night, we were reminded that the polls, the pundits, and the political elite don't determine elections - voters do,"" Black said in a statement. ""With Donald Trump's convincing win, Americans rejected the scandals and status quo politics of the Clinton campaign, and instead voted for real change to take our country back from the liberal stranglehold of the last eight years.""""I am elated over Donald Trump's decisive victory and look forward to working with him and our House and Senate Republican majorities to repeal Obamacare, protect life, secure our border, and act on other conservative reforms,"" Black added. ""With Donald Trump as our 45th President, we will make America great again.""Pro-life leaders say they will be working to ensure the promises made to protect both women and the unborn will be fulfilled.""Donald Trump made many promises to pro-lifers over the course of his campaign, and the pro-life generation will make sure he keeps those promises as president,"" said Hawkins.""Because of the pro-life pledges Donald Trump made during the campaign, there is now a clear path to end the public funding that enables the dismemberment, poisoning, or starving to death of one million innocent children each year,"" Rose added. ""It's critical that we unite to hold Mr. Trump to those pledges to defund Planned Parenthood, to appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices, and to ensure that taxpayers are never forced to fund abortions.""""Public opinion on abortion is transforming as more and more Americans recognize life inside the womb and refuse to accept the idea that women's rights are incompatible with children's rights,"" she said. ""Increasingly, Americans are pro-life and demand better for both women and preborn children than the violence that our laws condone.""We applaud candidates that took a stand on the most critical human rights issue of today, abortion. We congratulate President-elect Trump on his hard-fought win, as well Vice President-elect Pence, and our friends in Congress.

""Don't think people aren't listening to you,"" he added.Bannon said he was busy working in Trump's campaign data room on Tuesday night, so he did not see much of how the mainstream media covered the unfolding election. Marlow assured him that the journalists and commentators who got the 2016 election wrong, every step of the way, clearly intended to go on being wrong for the foreseeable future.""I think probably the only people in the universe that covered and worked on both Brexit, in any level of detail, and this election last night were Raheem Kassam, Alex Marlow, and the one and only mega-producer Caroline Magyarits,"" said Bannon, prompting what Marlow described as ""maniacal laughter"" from Magyarits off-mic.Bannon returned to a point he made during his pre-election Breitbart News Daily appearance, on the first anniversary of the show, about how the smug mainstream media assumed Trump voters were xenophobic and ignorant of world affairs, when, in fact, they were fully up to speed on the Brexit drama.""Nigel Farage is a hero to those people, and they know about him because they listen to the Breitbart show and go to Breitbart London and to the Breitbart pages and obviously other pages like Drudge and others,"" Bannon said, arguing that the mainstream media missed Brexit and Trump's presidential victory because they think such alternative sources of information are ""beneath them.""Bannon said he ""never doubted for a second"" that Trump would win.

It's crudely assembled, it's vulgar, and it's become an online campaign tradition as infamous as Matt Drudge's debate polls.""Comrade Stump,"" as he calls himself on Twitter, created several memes that stuck for Trump's fan base. By making a dubstep song, ""Centipede"" by Knife Party, the theme song to the series, a nature documentary voiceover sampled in the prelude inspired Trump supporters to call themselves ""centipedes"" and ""nimble navigators"" and crack jokes about Trump being a ""predator"" with ""hollow fangs.""Several other running jokes include air horns blaring after every Trump putdown or unfortunate event for his opponents, a video game sprite animation delivering a ""kill shot"" on defeated foes, and overlaying the faces of political players on meme-friendly movie clips such as Star Wars: Episode III's climactic lightsaber fight.On the night of Trump's epic victory, CSTT uploaded a teaser video (""Volume 29.5: THE MADMAN DID IT"") to sate his fans until a proper wrap-up for the series.

On Tuesday, Donald Trump became president-elect of the United States, sweeping Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in reliably blue states like Michigan and Wisconsin.As Republican nominee, Nixon won the 1968 largely on the back of a campaign targeting middle-class Americans who felt the Kennedy and Johnson administrations had allowed the government to descend into chaos, particularly in the context of the rudderless Vietnam war. These voters he dubbed the ""Silent Majority"" in a 1969 speech.

(AP) -- Demonstrators opposed to the election of Donald Trump smashed windows and set garbage bins on fire in downtown Oakland, California early Wednesday, as protesters swarmed streets across the country in response to the election. The protests elsewhere were generally peaceful.In Oregon, dozens of people blocked traffic in downtown Portland and forced a delay for trains on two light rail lines. Media reports said the crowd grew to about 300 people, including some who sat in the middle of the road to block traffic. The crowd of anti-Trump protesters burned American flags and chanted ""That's not my president.""In Pennsylvania, hundreds of University of Pittsburgh students marched through the streets, with some in the crowd calling for unity. The student-run campus newspaper, the Pitt News, tweeted about an event later Wednesday titled ""Emergency Meeting: Let's Unite to Stop President Trump.""In Seattle, a group of about 100 protesters gathered in the Capital Hill neighborhood, blocked roads and set a trash bin on fire.The Oakland protest grew to about 250 people by late Tuesday evening, according to police. Officer Marco Marquez said protesters damaged five businesses, breaking windows and spraying graffiti.Police issued a citation for a vehicle code violation, but did not make any arrests.A woman was struck by a car and severely injured when protesters got onto a highway early Wednesday morning, the California Highway Patrol said. Protesters vandalized the driver's SUV before officers intervened. The highway was closed for about 20 minutes.Marquez said the department is fully staffed for the possibility of another protest Wednesday evening.Oakland is a hotbed of violent protest in the San Francisco Bay Area. Protesters briefly shut down two major freeways, vandalized police cars and looted businesses two years ago when a Missouri grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in the fatal shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson.And nearly 80 people were arrested after a night in 2010 that saw rioters using metal bats to break store windows, setting fires and looting after a white transit police officer, Johannes Mehserle, was acquitted of murder and convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the slaying of Oscar Grant, an unarmed black man who was shot dead on a train platform the previous year.Elsewhere in California, police said at least 500 people swarmed on streets in and around UCLA, some shouting anti-Trump expletives and others chanting ""Not my president!""Smaller demonstrators were held at University of California campuses and neighborhoods in Berkeley, Irvine and Davis and at San Jose State.12:45 PM --With only New Hampshire left to be called, Clinton has turned in the Democratic Party's worst Electoral College performance in 28 years pic.twitter.com/APU85Ty50q-- Dan O'Donnell (@DanODradio) November 9, 201612:42 PM -- Egyptian president congratulates Trump.

What they did was, over an extended period of time, survey people and ask them what they were hearing about the two candidates.The answer is that with regard to Hillary Clinton, they heard a lot about email. With regard to Trump, they heard about nothing in particular.Read the rest of the tantrum here.10:24 AM --WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conceding his party's staggering electoral defeat, President Barack Obama on Wednesday invited President-elect Donald Trump to meet with him to discuss the handover of power from his administration to Trump's.The White House said Obama called the Republican in the early hours of the morning to congratulate him on his victory in the presidential campaign, which marked a forceful rebuke by voters to Obama's eight years in office. The two leaders planned to meet Thursday at the White House, where Obama was to update Trump about ongoing planning for the transition.Obama was to offer his first reaction to the election later Wednesday in a televised statement that the White House said would focus on ""what steps we can take as a country to come together after this hard-fought election season.""""Ensuring a smooth transition of power is one of the top priorities the president identified at the beginning of the year and a meeting with the president-elect is the next step,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.For Obama, the act of holding the meeting is a humbling blow to his legacy and to his hopes for leaving a lasting imprint on the nation's policies. Trump has vowed to rip up much of what Obama accomplished, including his signature health care law, the Iran nuclear deal and a painstakingly negotiated trade deal with Asia.Obama also called Hillary Clinton after it became clear she'd lost the race. The White House said Obama had ""expressed admiration for the strong campaign she waged throughout the country.""It was unclear how substantive Obama's call was with Trump, or how long it lasted, although the White House noted that Obama placed the call from his residence in the White House, rather than from the West Wing.Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, described it as a ""warm conversation"" and a ""gracious exchange."" She said Trump had missed the president's original call as Trump was speaking to supporters in New York, then called him back after leaving the stage.Like Clinton and other Democrats, Obama didn't appear to see Trump's victory coming. As he campaigned vigorously for Clinton in the race's final days, Obama said he was confident that if Americans showed up to vote, they'd choose against electing the billionaire former reality TV star with no formal government experience.He had also warned supporters in apocalyptic terms that ""the fate of the republic"" rested on Clinton defeating Trump on Election Day.Just in: the view from Burlington. @BernieSanders on @RealDonaldTrump's election pic.twitter.com/fIE1laaPrk

The two leaders planned to meet Thursday at the White House, where Obama was to update Trump about ongoing planning for the transition.Obama was to offer his first reaction to the election later Wednesday in a televised statement that the White House said would focus on ""what steps we can take as a country to come together after this hard-fought election season.""""Ensuring a smooth transition of power is one of the top priorities the president identified at the beginning of the year and a meeting with the president-elect is the next step,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.For Obama, the act of holding the meeting is a humbling blow to his legacy and to his hopes for leaving a lasting imprint on the nation's policies. Trump has vowed to rip up much of what Obama accomplished, including his signature health care law, the Iran nuclear deal and a painstakingly negotiated trade deal with Asia.Obama also called Hillary Clinton after it became clear she'd lost the race. The White House said Obama had ""expressed admiration for the strong campaign she waged throughout the country.""It was unclear how substantive Obama's call was with Trump, or how long it lasted, although the White House noted that Obama placed the call from his residence in the White House, rather than from the West Wing.Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, described it as a ""warm conversation"" and a ""gracious exchange."" She said Trump had missed the president's original call as Trump was speaking to supporters in New York, then called him back after leaving the stage.Like Clinton and other Democrats, Obama didn't appear to see Trump's victory coming. As he campaigned vigorously for Clinton in the race's final days, Obama said he was confident that if Americans showed up to vote, they'd choose against electing the billionaire former reality TV star with no formal government experience.He had also warned supporters in apocalyptic terms that ""the fate of the republic"" rested on Clinton defeating Trump on Election Day.BREITBART LIVE"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

Trump took the opposite position: vowing to defend Heller with SCOTUS justices ""in the mold of Justice Scalia"" and to maintain the Second Amendment ""in its strongest form.""Clinton promised universal background checks, an ""assault weapons"" ban, a ""high capacity"" magazine ban, and numerous other gun controls. Trump promised to save the Second Amendment from ""people like Hillary Clinton."" And he voiced direct opposition to expanding background checks or instituting ""assault weapon"" or ""high capacity"" magazine bans.Clinton raged against ""weapons of war"" after a gunman opened fire on innocents in the Orlando Pulse nightclub. Trump's consistent message was that Americans ought to be able to own the ""firearm of their choice"" and that gun-free zones pose a threat by disarming citizens.Throughout the race for the White House, Clinton made clear that she did not agree with the Heller ruling-a ruling which reaffirmed that the right to keep and bear arms was an individual right. And during a June 5, 2016, appearance on This Week with George Stephanopoulos, she twice refused to admit that an individual right to keep and bear arms was even constitutional. After being pressed by Stephanopoulos, she would only say that ""if"" such a right existed, it was not outside the purview of government regulation.Her exact words:I think that for most of our history there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment, until the decision by the late Justice [Antonin] Scalia. And there was no argument until then that localities, and states, and the federal government had a right-as we do with every amendment-to impose reasonable regulations.She clearly missed the part about ""shall not be infringed."" But Trump did not miss it, as he vowed again and again to stand with the NRA and ""save the Second Amendment.""Just says before the election, Rudy Giuliani stood behind a podium in Reno, Nevada, and said:If you elect Donald Trump you will preserve your Second Amendment right to bear arms. If you elect Hillary Clinton, she will appoint one judge and then two, and they will take it away from you, and a lot of your other rights.In the end, the people saw it the way Giuliani did. And they voted to save their Second Amendment-and the Heller decision-by choosing Trump over Clinton during a historic November 8 election.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

We submitted the questions to her under a court order issued by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on August 19, 2016.In our brief, we argue that Clinton ""failed to provide sufficient reasons for refusing to answer them, and the limited reasons she provides do not warrant sustaining her objections."" Hillary Clinton refused outright to answer questions about the creation of her email system, her decision to use the system despite warning from State Department officials, and the basis for her claim that the State Department had ""90-95 percent"" of her emails.In her responses sent to Judicial Watch and the court on October 13, 2016, Clinton refused to answer these three questions outright and responded 20 times that she ""does not recall"" information concerning her non-government clintonemail.com email system. She preceded her responses by eight ""general objections"" and two ""objections to definitions."" The words ""object"" or ""objection"" appear 84 times throughout the 23-page document submitted to the court and Judicial Watch.In our motion to compel her to answer, we argue:Pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, ""The grounds for objecting to an interrogatory must be stated with specificity. ... In addition, the party objecting to the interrogatory bears the burden of 'show[ing] why discovery should not be permitted. ...'"" Although she objected to the three interrogatories, Secretary Clinton failed to provide sufficient reasons for refusing to answer them, and the limited reasons she provides do not warrant sustaining her objections.Interrogatory 1 asks: ""Describe the creation of the clintonemail.com system, including who decided to create the system, the date it was decided to create the system, why it was created, who set it up, and when it became operational."" In our motion to compel, we argue:Secretary Clinton objects and asserts that the interrogatory is outside the scope of permitted discovery. ... However, the creation of the clintonemail.com system is squarely within the scope of permitted discovery.  Understanding the basic facts surrounding the creation of the system is an integral part of understanding how and why it came to be used for State Department business.  To date, no witness has testified about these facts, and the Court specifically authorized interrogatories to enable Plaintiff to gather this information. Secretary Clinton's refusal to answer the interrogatory is therefore misplaced.Interrogatory 14 asks:On March 6, 2009, Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Eric J. Boswell wrote in an Information Memo to your Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, that he ""cannot stress too strongly, however, that any unclassified BlackBerry is highly vulnerable in any setting to remotely and covertly monitoring conversations, retrieving email, and exploiting calendars."" A March 11, 2009, email states that, in a management meeting with the assistant secretaries, you approached Assistant Secretary Boswell and mentioned that you had read the ""IM"" and that you ""get it."" Did you review the March 6, 2009, Information Memo, and, if so, why did you continue using an unclassified BlackBerry to access your clintonemail.com email account to conduct official State Department business?Secretary Clinton objected to Interrogatory 14, asserting that it concerned ""cybersecurity issues outside the scope of permitted discovery."" In our motion to compel, we argue:Interrogatory 14 does not concern ""cybersecurity issues."" It asks whether Secretary Clinton read a memorandum about the general use of unapproved or unclassified Blackberries, and, if she did read the memorandum, why did she continue using an unapproved or unclassified Blackberry - the device by which [she] accessed the clintonemail.com account she used to conduct official government business. A yes or no answer to whether she read the memorandum will not reveal any information the parties' agreed-upon scope sought to avoid. Similarly, if the answer is yes, Secretary Clinton's explanation as to why, after reading the memorandum, she continued to access her clintonemail.com account through her Blackberry also will not reveal any information the parties' agreed-upon scope sought to avoid. The interrogatory clearly seeks information squarely within the scope of permitted discovery. Secretary Clinton should be compelled to answer Interrogatory 14.Interrogatory 24 asks:During your October 22, 2015 appearance before the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Benghazi, you testified that 90 to 95 percent of your emails ""were in the State's system"" and ""if they wanted to see them, they would certainly have been able to do so."" Identify the basis for this statement, including all facts on which you relied in support of the statement, how and when you became aware of these facts, and, if you were made aware of these facts by or through another person, identify the person who made you aware of these facts.Secretary Clinton objected to Interrogatory 24 and asserted that the interrogatory asked for information protected by the attorney-client privilege. In our motion to compel, we argue:Interrogatory 24 does not seek any factual information Secretary Clinton may have provided to her attorneys in confidence for purposes of obtaining legal advice.  Nor does it seek any advice Secretary Clinton's attorneys may have provided the secretary that would reveal facts she provided them in confidence.  The interrogatory only seeks the factual basis for a specific representation Secretary Clinton made to Congress.  It is irrelevant whether Secretary Clinton told her attorneys about the factual basis for this representation, either for purposes of obtaining legal advice or for some other purpose, because Plaintiff has not asked about any such communications.  As a result, the attorney client privilege does not apply.***Because Secretary Clinton has failed to provide any such information to justify her assertion of the attorney client privilege, she should be compelled to answer Interrogatory 24.By refusing to answer our simple questions, Hillary Clinton is obstructing Judicial Watch's efforts to get basic information about her email practices. Because she has not - and cannot - demonstrate that her refusal to answer our questions is proper, Hillary Clinton should be required by the court to answer them promptly.The Clinton responses to interrogatives were received in the Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was first filed in September 2013 seeking records about the controversial employment status of Huma Abedin, former deputy chief of staff to Clinton (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:13-cv-01363)). The lawsuit was reopened because of revelations about the clintonemail.com system.In the same cases we also filed another Motion to Compel against John Bentel, former State Department director of Information Resource Management of the Executive Secretariat, to answer 87 questions asked of him during his October 24 Judicial Watch deposition concerning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's non-state.gov email system. At the deposition, Bentel answered each of the questions, ""On advice from my legal counsel, I decline to answer the question and I invoke my Fifth Amendment rights."" Judicial Watch's court filing refutes Bentel's claim for Fifth Amendment self-incrimination protection, arguing:Mr. Bentel has invoked his Fifth Amendment rights without providing any justification whatsoever. He has not identified - let alone demonstrated - a fear of prosecution in answering any of the 87 questions asked of him during his deposition. Nor has he demonstrated any such fear is more than fanciful or merely speculative. Mr. Bentel has not provided Plaintiff or the Court with any pertinent information to allow it to assess the validity of the invocation for each of the 87 questions Mr. Bentel declined to answer.Judge Sullivan allowed us to depose Bentel in the first place, in part, because of his notable appearance in a May 2016 Inspector General's report that found:Mr. Bentel told employees in his office that Secretary Clinton's email arrangement had been approved by the State Department's legal staff and also instructed his subordinates not to discuss the Secretary's email again:In one meeting, one staff member raised concerns that information sent and received on Secretary Clinton's account could contain Federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy Federal recordkeeping requirements. According to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary's personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further. ... According to the other S/ES-IRM staff member who raised concerns about the server, the Director stated that the mission of S/ES-IRM is to support the Secretary and instructed the staff never to speak of the Secretary's personal email system again.It should disturb Americans that yet another Clinton IT official asserted the Fifth Amendment rather than answer straight-forward questions about Clinton's email scheme. You can see why this Clinton email scandal will continue for long time, though Election Day has passed.Pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, ""The grounds for objecting to an interrogatory must be stated with specificity. ... In addition, the party objecting to the interrogatory bears the burden of 'show[ing] why discovery should not be permitted. ...'""

Times Poll	"The USC Dornsife/Los Angles Times Daybreak presidential poll, which was widely criticized by the mainstream media for showing Republican Donald Trump consistently ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton, is taking a victory lap on Wednesday morning, after Trump's upset win.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe poll claimed all along that it did a better job than other polls of capturing the ""shy Trump"" electorate -- those voters who were going to vote for Trump but were embarrassed to tell pollsters they intended to do so, thanks to media pressure.David Lauter of the L.A.

Wall Street sent stocks down by over 20 percent after Ronald Reagan won the presidency.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe only Wall Street research and institutional advisory firm that saw a higher probability of a Donald Trump victory was Strategas Research Partners. Their analysts gave a 42 percent probability of a Trump win, due to the FBI's October 25 reopening of the Hillary Clinton email probe causing her negative ratings with voters to fall to Trump's negatives.When Donald Trump first entered the race in June 2015, the Las Vegas betting parlors gave him less than a 1 percent probability of becoming President. On November 7, his election eve odds of winning the highest office in the land was just a 23.5 percent probability.Trump's triumph is even more shocking to Wall Street, because the vast majority of analysts expected Democrats to win a four-seat majority in (and control of) the U.S. Senate, and be very close to taking the U.S. House.With Republicans holding 54 Senate seats going into the election, Strategas projected that both the Senate and the House would stay comfortably in the hands of the Republicans.Since equity markets hate surprises, both Donald Trump's and Ronald Reagan's against-the-odds victories caused big short-term stock losses. But Trump now has the opportunity to follow President Reagan's four point pro-growth plan for economic growth that reversed falling family incomes, raised millions out of poverty, and led to doubling of stock prices during his term:Reagan's policies resulted in the most successful economic experiment in the history of the world. The Reagan recovery was the longest peacetime expansion in American history. The longest previous expansion was just 58 months.President Reagan's expansion only ended in July 1992, when President George H.W. Bush's tax increase caused a nasty recession.SIGN UP	['Jones', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

""I saw some of the Hisba elements of Daesh (Islamic State) checking people's beards and clothes and looking for smokers"".Islamic State's Hisba force is a morality police unit which imposes the Sunni jihadists' interpretation of Islamic behavior. It forbids smoking, says women should be veiled and wear gloves, and bans men from Western-style dress including jeans and logos.Hisba units patrol the city in specially marked vehicles.""It looks like they want to prove their presence after they disappeared for the last 10 days, especially on the eastern bank,"" the resident said.Mosul is divided into two halves by the Tigris river running through its center. The eastern half, where elite Iraqi troops have broken through Islamic State defenses, has a more mixed population than the western, overwhelmingly Sunni Arab side, where Islamic State fighters are believed to be strongest.CRUCIFIED CORPSESThe militants are putting up a fierce defense after their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, told them in a speech last week to remain loyal to their commanders and not to retreat in the ""total war"" with their enemies.Iraqi military officials say they have sources inside the city, helping them identify Islamic State positions for targeting by the U.S.-led air coalition supporting the campaign, which is also backed by U.S. troops on the ground.The gruesome public display of the bodies in east Mosul appeared to be a warning against other potential informers.""I saw five corpses of young men which had been crucified at a road junction in east Mosul,"" not far from districts which had seen heavy fighting, said another resident.""The Daesh people hung the bodies out and said that these were agents passing news to the infidel forces and apostates,"" he said referring to the Western allies backing the campaign and the Shi'ite-led government of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.In another sign of a clampdown on contact with the outside world, one retired policeman said Islamic State officials were trying to inspect SIM cards to check on all communications.""I went to get my pension as usual, but the man at the office refused to give it to me unless I handed over my SIM card,"" the 65-year-old man, who gave his name as Abu Ali, said. ""These are the instructions from Daesh,"" the man told him.Many residents close to the fighting have said the scale of the clashes has been terrifying, with the sound of gunfire, mortar bombardments and air strikes echoing through the streets.In the Zuhour district, still controlled by Islamic State on Mosul's eastern bank, witnesses said that cars carrying mortars roamed the streets on Tuesday, but were not seen being fired - unlike in the previous two days.The relative quiet may reflect a reduction in fighting since Iraq's special forces first broke into eastern Mosul a week ago. They faced fierce resistance, and have not sought to any major advance since then.One witness said traffic had almost returned to normal in most parts of eastern Mosul and markets were operating, albeit not as busy as before the start of military operations.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

As in the case of the Brexit referendum, the establishment--including its sounding box, the mainstream media--stand in defiant denial of the facts and then rend their garments when their predictions prove illusory.For Western Europe, Trump's election doesn't just mean a change of direction for their most powerful ally, it also lends further credence and support to the movement that threatens to undermine ""the way things are done.""While some find this exhilarating and long overdue, for the Leftist establishment, it is a nameless nightmare.Follow Thomas D.

He is what the alarmists would call a full-on climate change ""denier"".
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012
Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014No world leader has ever been this outspoken on climate change. The only other one to have come close to this position was former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott - but he just didn't have the support base to maintain it and was ousted in a coup staged by one of the climate alarmist establishment, Malcolm Turnbull.But with a climate skeptic running the most powerful nation in the world, the $1.5 trillion per annum climate change industry is going to start to unravel big time. A Trump presidency is likely to be good news for fossil fuels (and heavy industry that needs cheap energy to survive); and very bad news for renewables.To get an idea of the horrors to come for the greenies, look at how they reacted to the prospect of his new Environmental Protection Agency Dismantler-in-Chief Myron Ebell.Ebell is an old friend of mine who works on climate and energy issues at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The fact that he's an old friend of mine probably tells you all you need to know about where he stands on global warming.Here's how Newsweek views him:Ebell is sometimes described as climate denier-in-chief, and he revels in it, crowing in his biography that he's been called one of the leading ""misleaders"" on climate change and ""villain of the month"" by one environmental group. David Goldston, a policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, says Ebell ""doesn't believe in climate change and wants to reverse the advances we've had in environmental protection and decimate--if not utterly destroy--the Environmental Protection Agency."" The Competitive Enterprise Institute, Ebell's employer, ""has done everything it can politically and through litigation to block any forward movement on climate and to try to harass anybody who is trying to get forward movement,"" Goldston says.Ebell is also the chairman of the Cooler Heads Coalition, more than two dozen nonprofit groups ""that question global warming alarmism and oppose energy rationing policies,"" according to the coalition's website. Those positions line up nicely with Trump's goals, which include ""saving"" the coal industry, reviving the Keystone XL oil pipeline and expanding offshore oil drilling.Ebell has attacked nearly every aspect of Obama's environmental policies and accomplishments. He has said that the president's decision in September to sign the Paris climate accord--which commits nations to sharp reductions in the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change--was ""clearly an unconstitutional usurpation of the Senate's authority"" because treaties need approval by two-thirds of the Senate. (The White House argued that it was an agreement, not a treaty.) In a speech in August at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump said he would cancel the agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. climate change programs.Yup, greenies. That climate change gravy train you've been riding these last four decades looks like it's headed for a major, Atlas-Shrugged-style tunnel incident...

He's pledged to act quickly to repeal Obama's landmark health care law, revoke the nuclear agreement with Iran and rewrite important trade deals with other countries, particularly Mexico and Canada.The Republican blasted through Democrats' longstanding firewall, carrying Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that hadn't voted for a GOP presidential candidate since the 1980s. He needed to win nearly all of the competitive battleground states, and he did just that, claiming Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and others.Global stock markets and U.S. stock futures plunged deeply, reflecting investor alarm over what a Trump presidency might mean for the economy and trade.A New York real estate developer who lives in a sparking Manhattan high-rise, Trump forged a striking connection with white, working class Americans who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying country. He cast immigration, both from Latin America and the Middle East, as the root of the problems plaguing many Americans and taped into fears of terrorism emanating at home and abroad.Trump will take office with Congress expected to be fully under Republican control. GOP Senate candidates fended off Democratic challengers in key states and appeared poised to maintain the majority. Republicans also maintained their grip on the House.Senate control means Trump will have great leeway in appointing Supreme Court justices, which could mean a major change to the right that would last for decades.Trump upended years of political convention on his way to the White House, leveling harshly personal insults on his rivals, deeming Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers, and vowing to temporarily suspend Muslim immigration to the U.S. He never released his tax returns, breaking with decades of campaign tradition, and eschewed the kind of robust data and field efforts that helped Obama win two terms in the White House, relying instead on his large, free-wheeling rallies to energize supporters. His campaign was frequently in chaos, and he cycled through three campaign managers this year.His final campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, touted the team's accomplishments as the final results rolled in, writing on Twitter that ""rally crowds matter"" and ""we expanded the map.""The mood at Clinton's party grew bleak as the night wore out, with some supporters leaving, others crying and hugging each other. Top campaign aides stopped returning calls and texts, as Clinton and her family hunkered down in a luxury hotel watching the returns.At 2 a.m., Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told the crowd to head home for the night.

(He had already answered that question in the affirmative in the first debate.) When he left the question open, Democrats and media critics suggested that his position was a threat to American democracy.Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri said at the time: """"How dangerous and frightening is that? It's certainly unprecedented. It's certainly disturbing.""Now, however, the tables have been turned. With virtually no path to victory, Clinton not only refused to concede, but refused to appear.At the Trump victory party at the New York Midtown Hilton, supporters of the Republican nominee booed Podesta and chanted, ""Lock her up!""They also chanted ""Call it!"" at the television screens showing Fox News coverage, as the network waited before declaring Trump the winner of several outstanding states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan. Some sang ""God Bless America,"" and others jeered, ""Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye!"" at the Fox News anchors.While Clinton fans filed out of the Javits Center, there was no sign from the Hilton that Trump supporters would go home before hearing a declaration of victory, and a speech from their presumed president-elect.Joel B.
