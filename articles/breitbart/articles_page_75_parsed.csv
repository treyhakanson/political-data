Podesta replied: ""Battered but ok."" Harwood replied: ""Sounds right to me.""Later that month, on Oct. 28, Harwood would go on to moderate the third Republican primary debate, and delivered a performance so obviously biased that even liberal commentators had to admit he had proven conservative suspicions correct. Harwood did not ask about Clinton's emails.Other emails, including an invitation for lunch, appear more innocuous. Some look simply like pitches for interviews. Regardless, they reveal a close relationship between Harwood and Podesta -- and apparent political support from Harwood.On Jan. 28, 2016, for example, Harwood emailed Podesta to report that Clinton had done well at an event in Iowa: ""She was good here in Newton.""And on March 14, 2016, Harwood emailed Podesta: ""how are you feeling about tomorrow?"" The next day, March 15, was an important Democratic primary day, when Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and North Carolina voted.Clinton won all five contests -- though by a narrow margin in Missouri and Illinois Harwood wrote again to Podesta: ""Congrats - pretty strong."" Podesta then replied to Harwood in the early hours of March 16: ""Yup. Feeling good.""Revelations from the Wikileaks email dump are ongoing -- though the media have shown a curious reluctance to highlight them, focusing instead on leaked video of Donald Trump joking about groping women in 2005.Joel B.

The email chain was unstoppable.Campaign chief John Podesta suggested an idea of a joke, pitching one about Donald Trump and Clinton's Benghazi testimony.""I used to be obsessed with Donald Trump's hair, that was until I got to spend 11 hours staring at the top of Trey Gowdy's head,"" Podesta wrote.""Just wonder if that undercuts our statesmanship point too much,"" replied a public relations consultant on the email.""I don't think so,"" Podesta answered.""That's because you love your own joke,"" shot back Director of Communications Jennifer Palmieri.Jake Sullivan, a foreign policy advisor for the campaign, added that he ""loved the joke"" but was concerned that Clinton should take the high road.""I think HRC should stay above the committee - and especially above personal insults about it. She's got every inch of the high ground right now,"" he wrote in response.""Wow. You people are a bunch of ninnies,"" Palmieri replied, before clarifying that she was only ""kidding"" after someone appeared upset.Another consultant emailed to say he thought the joke would work, but that it gave Bernie Sanders too much credit for helping her get over her email issues.He pitched a different idea: ""I don't if you all saw it but the hearing went on for 11 hours. Eleven hours. I was kind of expecting around hour #8 Bernie Sanders would burst in and shout - ""enough about your damn emails Hillary!!""Podesta advised them to steer away from email jokes.""I defer if others think this buys us good will with Sanders people, but email jokes in Iowa usually end up badly and don't we want to move on?"" he wrote. (It's possible that Podesta was referring to Clinton's widely criticized Snapchat joke about her emails at the Iowa Wing Ding dinner.)Hillary Campaign manager Robby Mook also had a suggestion.""Is there some Apprentice joke to make? I never saw the show,"" he said. ""I'm also the worst person to generate jokes.""It appears that Palmieri enjoyed the thought of a good email joke, suggesting another one during a March, 2015 email to discuss a speech to Emily's List.""I wanted to float idea of HRC making a joke about the email situation at the Emily's List dinner tonight. What do folks think about that?"" she wrote.Campaign spokesperson Nick Merrill gave it some tepid support.""I don't think it's nuts if we can come up with the right thing. But it could also be nuts..."" he wrote.Deputy Communications Director Kristina Schake agreed.""I think it would be good for her to show some humor. This is her crowd so the response would be great,"" she wrote.A political consultant disagreed.""We don't know what's in the emails, so we are nervous about this,"" she cautioned. ""Might get a big laugh tonight and regret it when content of emails is disclosed.""Palmieri also pitched the idea of using an email joke in Terry McAuliffe's Gridiron Speech.""Anyway what do we think about using gridiron to puncture the email story a little,"" she wrote.""I'm fine w it,"" Mook replied, prompting an annoyed response from Palmieri.""Fine with it"" is the kind of answer I used to get from Dan Pfeiffer,"" she wrote back, referring to her former White House colleague. ""Do you LIKE it??""(Obama ended up featuring an email joke in his Gridiron speech instead.)SIGN UP"	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

7	7	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/10/emails-show-private-public-clinton-statements-clash/	Emails Show How Private and Public Clinton Statements Clash	"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Behind closed doors, Hillary Clinton adopted a rather more accommodating tone with Wall Street than she has on the campaign trail.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn private paid speeches to financial firms and interest groups before she declared her candidacy, the Democratic presidential nominee comes off as a knowing insider, willing to cut backroom deals, embrace open trade and grant Wall Street a central role in crafting financial regulations, according to excerpts obtained last week through hacked campaign emails provided to WikiLeaks.Compare that with her public remarks in the presidential race. For voters, Clinton has embraced the rhetoric of a class warrior: Higher taxes on the wealthy. Tougher rules for Wall Street. Empathy for the financial burdens of ordinary Americans.The gap between her private and public remarks helps explain the relatively high levels of distrust that voters, including some of her own supporters, have expressed about the former secretary of state, New York senator and presidential spouse. Privately, to audiences at Goldman Sachs and others, Clinton expressed a philosophy that in some ways clashes with the progressive vision she has articulated while campaigning.Here's a breakdown of the differences:--WALL STREETIn public, Clinton has taken a hard tack toward Wall Street, opposing any weakening of the regulatory reforms passed after the 2008 financial meltdown. She has warned that Republican lawmakers and Donald Trump want to abolish the stricter rules imposed under the Dodd-Frank law enacted in 2010.""We should extend the rules passed in Dodd-Frank on Wall Street in crisis and strengthen them both for the big banks and the shadow banking system,"" Clinton said in a speech in North Carolina this summer. ""And I will veto any reforms to repeal those rules and vigorously enforce the law with accountability so Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again.""Yet fears have lingered that despite such proclamations, Clinton remains too cozy with major banks and investment funds. The financial sector has been a major source of campaign donations for Clinton. And in a paid speech for a Goldman Sachs symposium in 2013, Clinton suggested that the industry should play a dominant hand in developing its own rules""There's nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad,"" she is quoted as saying in the hacked emails. ""How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.""Many experts agree that the financial industry itself needs to have some voice in crafting regulations, if new rules are to be effective and provide safety without sacrificing economic growth. But the emphasis in her private speech was much more sympathetic to the financial sector than what some industry watchdogs would wish.THE MIDDLE CLASSClinton routinely celebrates her connection to average Americans.""My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top,"" she said in an August speech. ""This is personal for me. I am a product of the American middle class.... I've always remembered that I'm the daughter of a small-business owner and the granddaughter of a factory worker - and proud of both.""Yet despite the vast financial riches that she and her husband, Bill, began reaping once he left the presidency in 2001, Clinton even seemed to suggest that they face the same struggles with debt and college costs that many American households do.""We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,"" Clinton told ABC News in 2014. ""We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea's education.""The Clintons are now worth several tens of millions of dollars, collected from speeches, book deals and other business arrangements. She seldom highlights this wealth in campaign addresses.But she did so in a 2014 speech for Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, the investment management company. Speaking in private, Clinton acknowledged being increasingly isolated from the financial struggles of much of the country, saying, instead, that memories of her middle class past are her primary connection now.""Obviously, I'm kind of far removed because the life I've lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy,"" she said.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

LOUIS (AP) -- Donald Trump, on the defensive since a video came out depicting him using vulgar language about women and seeming to condone sexual assault, held a pre-debate appearance Sunday with women who accused Bill Clinton of rape and unwanted sexual advances.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTrump has telegraphed for days that he was going to make the accusations against the former president a part of his White House campaign. It was a strategy he raised in his taped apology, posted hours after Friday's leak of the video from 2005 that has rocked his campaign and caused dozens of Republican lawmakers to abandon their support of his candidacy.Trump refused to take questions when he appeared with Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey at the St. Louis hotel where he was preparing for the debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton. The meeting was posted on his Facebook page. The four women also were invited by Trump to watch the debate inside the debate hall.""Mr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me,"" Broaddrick said. ""I don't think there's any comparison.""Broaddrick, a former Arkansas nursing home administrator, first claimed 17 years ago that Bill Clinton raped her during a meeting in Little Rock in 1978. She sued Bill Clinton in 1999; the case was dismissed in 2001. A Twitter account that claimed to be that of Broaddrick revived the allegations on Saturday and was retweeted by Trump. Bill Clinton has long denied her account.Jones, a former Arkansas state worker, alleged in 1991 that Bill Clinton propositioned and exposed himself to her. In 1994, she filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him. Bill Clinton's lawyers tried to have the suit dismissed. In November 1998, he paid Jones $850,000 to settle the case without apologizing or acknowledging culpability.""I think they should all look at the fact that (Trump) is a good person,"" Jones said. ""He's not what other people have been saying he's been, like Hillary. He's going to make America great again.""Willey, a former White House volunteer, is using a website to again accuse Bill Clinton of forcing himself on her in 1993. He denied her charge and an independent prosecutor later concluded there was no evidence to doubt that denial.Kathy Shelton, a fourth woman who appeared with Trump at the hotel conference room, was an Arkansas sexual assault victim whose assailant was defended by Hillary Clinton.In 1975, at age 12, Shelton was sexually assaulted in northwest Arkansas. Clinton was asked by a judge overseeing the case to represent Shelton's alleged attacker. After the prosecution lost key evidence, Clinton's client entered a plea to a lesser charge. In an interview a decade later, Clinton expressed horror at the crime, but was recorded on tape laughing about procedural details of the case. The audio has been seized on by conservative groups looking to attack Clinton's presidential candidacy.On Friday, The Washington Post and NBC released a video of Trump, unaware he was on a hot microphone, suggesting that he forced himself on women to ""grab them by the p---"" and that ""when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.""The comments have prompted a number of prominent Republicans to un-endorse the celebrity businessman.SIGN UP"	['Jones', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem,"" Trump told the woman. ""And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it,"" Trump said.The questioner did not refer to Americans being killed in terror attacks, but suggested that Muslims are indirect victims of the jihad attacks. ""With Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?"" the questioner said. There were no warnings about numerous pending Islamic attacks, including the Boston bombings, the 2015 San Bernardino attack and the recent bombings in New Jersey, despite evidence of extensive preparations.In his response to the question, Trump cited the San Bernardino attack:In San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They'll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.In her response to the same question, Hillary Clinton criticized Trump for his insistence on greater cooperation from Muslims, and she downplayed the question of whether Muslims should do more to alert police when fellow Muslims are preparing to killed Americans. It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims,"" she said.  We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see. Clinton also insisted there's no conflict between Islam and the non-Islamic West, despite the statements by Islamic attackers that they're motivated by Islam. We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.Under President Barack Obama, various Islamic political groups have opposed bipartisan demands for cooperation, and have successfully lobbied for restrictions on FBI investigations. These groups have also successfully pushed the establishment media to use the term, ""Islamophobia"" which suggests that Americans' reaction to terror attacks is excessive.

I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see. 

We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.
SIGN UPMuslims living in America need to alert the government when they see ""hatred,"" Donald Trump told a Muslim woman invited to the second presidential debate to ask a question about ""Islamophobia"" among Americans. ""Whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem,"" Trump told the woman. ""And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it,"" Trump said.ith Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?"" the questioner said. There were no warnings about numerous pending Islamic attacks, including the Boston bombings, the 2015 San Bernardino attack and the recent bombings in New Jersey, despite evidence of extensive preparations.In her response to the same question, Hillary Clinton criticized Trump for his insistence on greater cooperation from Muslims, and she downplayed the question of whether Muslims should do more to alert police when fellow Muslims are preparing to killed Americans. It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims,"" she said.  We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see. Clinton also insisted there's no conflict between Islam and the non-Islamic West, despite the statements by Islamic attackers that they're motivated by Islam. We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.Under President Barack Obama, various Islamic political groups have opposed bipartisan demands for cooperation, and have successfully lobbied for restrictions on FBI investigations. These groups have also successfully pushed the establishment media to use the term, ""Islamophobia"" which suggests that Americans' reaction to terror attacks is excessive.  "	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

As a precautionary measure, Podesta purportedly instructed the campaign's top election lawyer, Marc Elias, to reach out to the concerned Clinton family associates to address their requests for organizing ""lawyers for caucus protection, election protection"" and other matters.Pre-caucus polling in Colorado at the time evidenced a dramatically tightening race between Clinton and Obama before Super Tuesday in 2008. Spring and fall 2007 polls showed Clinton enjoying a substantial, double-digit lead, according to Real Clear Politics. A Denver Post survey conducted shortly before the caucus showed a two-point edge favoring Senator Obama, however. The New York Times would later report that Obama was victorious by a 2-to-1 margin, enjoying 67 percent support compared to Clinton's 32.The leaked Podesta email does not offer any additional basis for their concerns apart from the assertions of trusted Clinton confidants.Hillary Clinton's 2016 rhetoric with respect to election integrity concerns has been largely in-step with the Democrat Party line that voter fraud is an imaginary menace and any attempt to combat it otherwise should be seen as a ""blast from a Jim Crow past"". During a January 2016 speech dedicated to ""voting rights"" in Houston, Texas, she called on proponents of voter ID and similar policies ""to stop fear mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they're so scared of letting citizens have their say.""Of additional note is the inclusion of Mr. Elias and his tasking to help prevent ""ineligible voters"" from possibly stealing Colorado and others from Clinton again. One month after the email was apparently sent, the Clinton election attorney would receive considerable recognition from The New York Times and others for accepting $5 million direct from progressive financier George Soros to attack voter ID and other election integrity reforms in multiple states. Proponents of such reforms argue that the laws are designed to keep ineligible ballots from being cast at the polling place.Logan Churchwell is the Assistant Editor and a founding member of the Breitbart Texas team.

She further states that the failure of Common Core developers to think through the politics of the education program allowed conservative grassroots parent and taxpayer groups to organize against it.According to the WikiLeaks email, Clinton referred to conservative parent activists who have charged that the Constitution provides for no federal role in education as those ""who don't think anybody should be told anything about what to study, even if it's the multiplication tables,"" and who say ""that should all be left to local control.""Clinton said:The common core is a perfect example. I mean, the common core was negotiated by a bipartisan group of governors. And maybe they thought - I mean, I think this was a political failure because they negotiated something and they had no real agreed-upon program for explaining it and selling it to people so that they left an opening for those who were always in the education debate, who don't think anybody should be told anything about what to study, even if it's the multiplication tables. You know, that that should all be left to local control. And then you get into more complicated areas, as we all know, that that's just totally off limits.  And then using common core results for teacher evaluation when everybody knew that it was going to be complicated to implement.""Ironically, in the same speech, Clinton also acknowledged:[U]nless you're a governor or maybe a mayor who has authority over your schools, there's not really very much that most politicians can do because of the way our system of education is governed. Obviously, local school boards, colleges and universities, they have separate governance. And we don't want politicians interfering too much in the independence of the governance of education.However, in a recent town hall geared to women and young people, Clinton, with her daughter Chelsea in tow, presented her view of cradle to grave federal intrusion into a ""life of Julia"" for girls and women. Clinton is a major supporter of federal assistance for pregnancy and pre-natal care, universal pre-K, childcare, paid family leave, free college tuition and student loan forgiveness, and for single payer, government-sponsored health insurance.Clinton wants taxpayers to fund abortions for women of black and Latino ethnicity as well.Interestingly, the chancellor at University of California, Berkeley says Clinton's plan to provide free college tuition to students is a campaign pledge that is unlikely to ever be implemented.Professor Nicholas Dirks says Clinton's plan would invite unprecedented federal control over university-led research.""I would love to see the Clinton administration come and make college free for students coming from families earning less than $125,000,"" Professor Nicholas Dirks says. ""But I don't think it's going to happen.""""[I]f such a thing came to be, there would be a real concerted effort to control parts of some of the great research institutions that are public in ways that might compromise their capacity to compete at the highest level,"" he added, noting as well that implementing Clinton's plan would be a ""complicated political process"" since state governments oversee universities.Just as with No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top - the latter of which gave us Common Core - Clinton's ""New College Compact"" revolves around the federal government incentivizing states with federal money and perks in return for debt-free tuition for lower income students.Writing at Forbes, George Leef asserts what Dirks observes: that Hillary Clinton can't ""fix"" college with more federal interference and control. Leef notes that Clinton's objective of launching more low-income students into college contains ""two mistaken beliefs"": ""that the cost of attending is the main reason why many students from non-wealthy families don't graduate from college and that getting a college degree would be very beneficial to them.""Leef first notes that, although the cost of college has indeed risen, other low-cost options are available, such as community college - the expense for which can often be covered by Pell grants. He also says, ""[W]hen people shop around for higher education, almost no one is completely priced out.""Leef points out, however, that cost is not the primary reason lower income students don't seek out college.""The main reason why most don't enroll isn't the cost, but rather because they aren't academically prepared for or (even if academically prepared) interested in devoting more years of their lives to formal schooling,"" he says. ""Trying to lure such individuals into college with free tuition is a bad idea.""Unlike Clinton - who continually urges more federal spending in education as the nation's best ""investment"" - Leef states, ""The economy does not automatically create more 'good jobs' simply because more college graduates enter the labor market.""""Government policy aimed at 'producing' more graduates will only mean more young people who are over-credentialed for the work available,"" he explains. ""America doesn't have a shortage of people with college degrees. What it does have is a shortage of jobs that pay well. Unfortunately, the Clinton plan would make that problem even worse.""The common core is a perfect example. I mean, the common core was negotiated by a bipartisan group of governors. And maybe they thought - I mean, I think this was a political failure because they negotiated something and they had no real agreed-upon program for explaining it and selling it to people so that they left an opening for those who were always in the education debate, who don't think anybody should be told anything about what to study, even if it's the multiplication tables.

She lies even when she doesn't have to.For instance, while campaigning in Iowa, she told a group of supporters that her grandparents were immigrants to the United States.""All of my grandparents, you know, came over here,"" she said. ""So I sit here and I think, well you're talking about the second, third generation. That's me, that's you.""The story was untrue. One of her grandparents was an immigrant; three were not.Another time Hillary said, ""I actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before [Obama] did""--a statement that earned her a Pinocchio for lying from ""The Fact Checker"" in the Washington Post.Hillary lied when she said that she ""did not mail any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material."" It turned out that there were more than two thousand such documents on her email server--twenty-two of which were marked ""special access program,"" a level of classification higher than top secret.She lied when she said that she employed her private email ""as a convenience"" so that she could use a single phone for both work and personal communications. It turned out that she owned several electronic devices and that, in any case, Huma Abedin carried them for her.She lied when she said she had voluntarily turned over all her work emails to the State Department. It turned out that she relinquished those emails only when forced to under subpoena, and that she withheld dozens of Benghazi-related emails she had exchanged with her back-channel fixer Sidney Blumenthal.""Clinton has repeated numerous times that the [email] arrangement was 'allowed,' though no one in the administration has ever said they approved her server,"" wrote The Hill's A. B. Stoddard. ""So Democrats--like Republicans--assume she is making a misleading statement about her own unorthodox decision to do something no Cabinet secretary had ever done before.""She lied when, according to the New York Times, she told the FBI that former Secretary of State Colin Powell had advised her to conduct unclassified state business using a private email account. Powell, one of the most respected elder statesmen in the country, quickly denied the report. ""Her people have been trying to pin it on me,"" he said. ""The truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did.""Hillary lied when she said that as secretary of state she did not grant special favors to foreigners who donated money to the Clinton Foundation. As I documented with eyewitness accounts in Unlikeable: The Problem with Hillary, wealthy foreign donors who gave millions to the foundation received special treatment. One such donor was a Canadian businessman who was granted permission to sell control of 20 percent of America's uranium production capacity to Vladimir Putin's Russia. After the deal went through, Bill Clinton was invited to Moscow to give a speech. He was paid $500,000.""The Clinton Foundation was ostensibly set up to solve the world's most pressing problems,"" writes David Harsanyi, senior editor at The Federalist. ""Although it has done some fine work, it's most fruitful program has been leveraging [Hillary] Clinton's position in the State Department to enrich her family, friends and cronies. The foundation was a center of influence peddling. Rock stars. Soccer players. Conglomerates. Crown princes. All of them paid in. All of them expected access to the U.S. government."" And most of them got it.Indeed, more than half of the private citizens who were granted access to Hillary while she was at Foggy Bottom--85 out of the 154 who got face time or spoke to her--donated to the foundation, for a total of $156 million.The membrane that should have prevented seepage between the State Department and the foundation turned out to be totally permeable. ""Laura Graham, a senior executive at the foundation,"" reported the New York Post, left almost 150 telephone messages over two years for Cheryl Mills, Hillary's chief of staff."" And when Mills wasn't taking telephone calls from Graham and doing favors for foundation donors, she was traveling to New York City to interview job candidates for a top job at the foundation.The impact of Hillary's menagerie of lies was reflected in public opinion polls. Sixty percent of Americans considered her ""untrustworthy."" And when Gallup asked Americans what word came to mind when they heard the name ""Hillary Clinton,"" a majority replied ""dishonest/liar/don't trust her/poor character.""To deal with this problem, her friends and campaign staffers set about trying to make Hillary more likeable.""She needs to try to humanize herself, because in some ways she's kind of become a cardboard cutout figure,"" said liberal historian Douglas Brinkley.But rehabilitating Hillary at this stage in her life (she turns sixty-nine on October 26) was more easily said than done.""Hillary still obsesses about money, a narrative thread that has existed since she was thwarted in her desire to build a pool at the governor's mansion in poor Arkansas and left the White House with a doggie bag full of sofas, rugs, lamps, TVs and china, some of which the Clintons later had to pay for or return,"" writes New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. ""Even Chelsea was cashing in, getting a ridiculous, $600,000-a-year scion salary from NBC, far greater than that of many of the network's correspondents. As a Clinton White House aide once explained to me, 'Hillary, though a Methodist, thinks of herself like an Episcopal bishop who deserves to live at the level of her wealthy parishioners, in return for devoting herself to God and good works.'""And the social critic Camille Paglia puts it this way: ""So much must be overlooked or discounted--from Hillary's compulsive money-lust and her brazen indifference to normal rules to her conspiratorial use of shadowy surrogates and her sociopathic shape-shifting in policy positions for momentary expedience.""SIGN UP"	['Blumenthal', 'Clinton']	['god']

Mike Pence courted close to 300 enthusiastic North Carolina voters on Monday in his first campaign event since his running mate, presidential candidate Donald Trump, took on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in their second debate of the election season.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPence offered encouragement to those recovering from Hurricane Matthew, saying, ""Our nation is remembering North Carolina, your good Governor Pat McCrory.""""It's been an interesting few days,"" Pence continued. ""I joined the campaign in a heartbeart.""Pence referred to Sunday night's debate, calling Trump a fighter and a winner, and declaring, as he has many times before, ""He will make America great again.""""He literally embodies the spirit of America,"" Pence said of Trump. ""He is willing to fight every day for what he believes in and what makes this nation great.""Addressing the eleven-year-old video that has been circulating national television and social media, the video for which Trump issued a video apology, Pence said, ""It takes a big man to know when he's wrong and to admit it. ... Donald Trump showed last night that he's a big man.""Pence spoke of his own Christian faith and of those who asked him about it in recent days. He spoke of the high standards to which those who call themselves Christians are called. Pence then added, ""We all fall short of the glory of God, and there is no one righteous, other than the One.""""The other part of my faith is, I believe in grace. I believe in forgiveness,"" continued Pence. ""We have been forgiven.""In Pence's prior acknowledgement of Trump's apology, he expressed hope that America would see Trump's heart during the debate. Pence had also said that he was ""grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people."" He then said he was praying for the Trump family.On Monday afternoon in Charlotte, Pence told the crowd that during the debate, Trump indeed ""showed heart, humility; then he fought back.""Pence moved on to speak of what the Trump-Pence administration would bring. ""This election, it's not just a choice between two people; it's a choice between two futures. ... I choose a stronger America at home and abroad. ... I choose an America that stands up for the constitutional principles.""He spoke of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will lead to a more prosperous future. ""We're gonna take the advice of Hillary's husband,"" said Pence, referencing former President Bill Clinton's statements at a rally, where he called Obamacare crazy. ""We're going to renegotiate NAFTA so it works for the American economy,"" said Pence.Pence went on to say that government wants to be involved in every aspect of our lives.He pivoted, then, to the Supreme Court, stating that the next president will likely decide the Supreme Court for the next 40 years.Pence said the U.S. ""must decide here and now that the person we elect as the next President of the United States is Donald Trump."" This is essential,"" he said, ""for sake of the rule of law, the Constitution, life, Second Amendment, right to keep and bear arms.""""I was awfully proud of my running mate last night,"" Pence said, returning to the subject of Sunday night's debate. He told the crowd that the media continues to ignore the avalanche of corruptions that come out of the Clintons.""""Donald Trump went out on that stage last night and put the truth before the American people,"" Pence said. He then revisited the issues that Clinton's private foundation took millions from foreign donors as she headed up the State Department, that she destroyed emails from a private server, and her use of high technology to erase emails.Clinton's private speeches to foreign financial groups came up, as well. Pence referenced the WikiLeaks release of the emails of John Podesta, a close adviser to President Obama. Podesta was also chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton and current Chairman of Hillary for America. He spoke of the hemispheric market with ""Open trade and open borders,"" documented in the emails, the accuracy of which the Clinton campaign has not refuted.Pence spoke of when he first got to know the Trumps during the summer. ""To know the Trumps is to know a family,"" said Pence.Pence told the crowd that in Donald Trump and Mike Pence they have two people who will fight every day for the American Dream for everyone in this nation.""I truly do believe that now is the time to do all that we can,"" said Pence, who suggested that those who are inclined could bend a knee and pray for the country.Clinton and Trump have jockeyed for the advantage, often within the statistical margin of error, in North Carolina polls in the past several months. A Real Clear Politics average of five recent polls gives Clinton the current advantage over Trump by 2.6 percent, in part due to a late September poll that gave her a six-point advantage. The most recent poll included in that average, High Point, showed Clinton up just one point. That poll was taken from October 1-6.From the Charlotte event, Pence will continue on to hold an evening event in Fletcher, just outside of Asheville.

Ryan (R.-Wis.) and other Republican leaders used the recently released lewd tape of Donald J. Trump to execute a putsch against the GOP nominee for president.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""I think this whole tape... video tape thing was planned, I think it was timed, I think it might have even been a conspiracy among establishment Republicans who have known about it for weeks and who tried to time it to do the maximum damage to Donald Trump, and I just... I just think it just backfired on them,"" said Jerry Fawell Jr., an attorney, who succeeded his father at the helm of the Lynchburg, Virginia college.On Monday, the Speaker told members of the Republican House Conference that he would not campaign with Trump, nor would he defend Trump, according to an NBC News report based on a background conversation with a Ryan spokesman. NBC was the owner of the Access Hollywo0d tape that The Washington Post released Friday revealing the GOP nominee using direct and foul language in reference to courtship and the way women interact with celebrities.Falwell told Cosby he was upset by the tape and how it was received by members of his family, but it did not shake his support for the New York City developer.Cosby asked Falwell if his narrative was conjecture and he told her it was based on real conversations he had with people familiar with Republican conspirators.Falwell, who endorsed Trump in January, said, ""I just think some of the establishment Republicans--I'm not going to name any names, I've got some independent information, but I'm not going... I'm not going to reveal it on the air--but I think some of the establishment folks who reluctantly endorsed him had this planned all along as a way to slither out of the endorsement, and I think it backfired on them, and I'm glad to see that.""When Cosby pressed Falwell, he was more direct: ""It wasn't a coincidence that it came out right before Trump was supposed to appear with Paul Ryan at a rally, and it conveniently gave Paul Ryan a way to disinvite Trump.""The Trump surrogate said he has heard for a while from trusted Republican sources that something was being planned that would allow the GOP leaders to take Trump off the ticket.""It was just something that, that I was told was going to come down in October,"" he said.
