I mean, where's your proof in that,"" she said.The lecture started with a video on the ""Mistreatment of Native Americans"" before the teacher goes on to say, ""Am I racist? And I say yea. I don't want to be. It's not like I choose to be racist, but do I do things because of the way I was raised?""""I felt like he was encouraging people to kind of pick on people for being white,"" the student said.Dr. Joe Siano, the superintendent of Norman Public Schools, released a statement in response to the issue:Racism is an important topic that we discuss in our schools. While discussing a variety of philosophical perspectives on culture, race and ethics, a teacher was attempting to convey to students in an elective philosophy course a perspective that had been shared at a university lecture he had attended. We regret that the discussion was poorly handled. When the district was notified of this concern it was immediately addressed. We are committed to ensuring inclusiveness in our schools.""You start telling someone something over and over again that's an opinion and they start taking it as fact,"" the student said. ""So I wanted him to apologize and make it obvious and apparent to everyone that was his opinion.""The teacher has not responded to KFOR's requests for comment and has not released a public statement on the matter. There is no word on whether the teacher has been disciplined.Racism is an important topic that we discuss in our schools.

That leaves a population of 280 million native-born Americans. If the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants are discounted, then this is a nation of 280 million Americans and 33 million invited immigrants.

The 13.3 percent of the nation's population comprised of immigrants in 2014 is the highest percentage in 94 years. Between 2000 and 2014, 18.7 million new immigrants (legal and illegal) settled in the United States ... A large share of immigrants have low levels of formal education. Of adult immigrants (ages 25 to 65), 28 percent have not completed high school, compared to 8 percent of natives. The share of immigrants (25 to 65) with at least a bachelor's degree is only slightly lower than natives -- 30 percent vs. 32 percent.However, the federal government is rapidly increasing the inflow of immigrants. For example, the federal brings in one immigrant for every four Americans who turn 18.According to the Census Bureau, one new American is born every eight seconds, and a new immigrant arrives every 29 seconds.

Clinton's new pushback against publicly labeling herself as for ""open borders"" while clearly championing open border policies is perhaps related to the fact that increasing immigration levels is not a popular policy. According to Pew, an overwhelming 83 percent of the American electorate overall would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.
...

Interestingly, these so-called ""fact checks"" rarely mention how many migrants would be imported into the country under a Hillary Clinton Presidency. While Bill Clinton has described our current immigration policy as one of ""open borders,"" his wife has championed policies that would open our borders even further.
For example, the 2013 Gang of Eight bill Clinton supported would have tripled green card issuances--permanently resettling 33 million foreign nationals on green cards in the span of a single decade--and would have doubled foreign guest worker visas to compete for American jobs.
The 2006 Ted Kennedy immigration plan Clinton supported would have more than doubled legal immigration by increasing the number of family-based and employment-based visas.
Clinton's refugee program, which she outlined in 2015, calls for a 550 percent increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted. If Clinton were to continue this policy throughout her presidency, the U.S. could potentially permanently resettle nearly one million Muslim migrants during the first term of her presidency alone--and all of their children born on American soil would be automatically awarded U.S. citizenship.
The Center for Immigration Studies' Steve Camarota has projected that, based on the minimal figures Clinton has put forth thus far, Clinton could add 10 million new immigrants to the U.S. during her first term alone - in addition to the 11 million illegal immigrants Clinton has said she plans to amnesty within her first 100 days in office.

Judge Walker, an Obama nominee, is hearing the motion on an expedited basis at 9:00 a.m. Thursday in the Federal District Courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida.Democratic Party lawyers are arguing that Judge Walker's decision last week to extend voter registration -- due to Hurricane Matthew -- makes it impossible to update voter rolls to reflect the correct information for any newly-registratered voters.Lawyers, hired by the Republican Party of Florida, filed a Motion to Intervene in the case late Wednesday for the purpose of opposing the Democrats' request to allow un-verified voters to cast regular ballots. Republican Party attorneys argued in a supporting legal memorandum that there is no basis to suspend Florida's provisional ballot statute -- which would invite the casting of fraudulent votes by ineligible voters.""For many years, Florida law has provided that a voter registration application may be accepted as valid only after the applicant's identity has been verified by election officials,"" Attorney Daniel Nordby of Shutts & Bowen wrote in the Motion to Intervene filed on behalf of the Republican Party of Florida.""This is accomplished by verifying the existence or nonexistence of the applicant's driver license number, Florida identification card number, or the last four digits of the social security number provided by the applicant on his or her voter registration application. If the number provided by the applicant cannot be verified, the applicant is notified and provided an opportunity to provide evidence to the supervisor of elections sufficient to verify the authenticity of the number.""If Judge Walker rules in the Democratic Party's favor, there would be no legal recourse to stop potential hundreds of thousands of unverifiable voters from casting votes, lawyers with knowledge of the case told Breitbart News.""If Judge Walker sides with the Democratic Party, we could be looking at bus loads of unverified voters casting votes from precinct to precinct until the end of early voting,"" one source said.Early voting in Florida, depending on specific dates set by each county, begins between October 24 and October 29, and ends on either November 5 or November 6.A valid photo ID is required at each voting precinct in Florida. However, if Judge Walker rules in the Democratic Party's favor, early votes will automatically be counted as regular ballots.Judge Walker's ruling, a source said, could set the stage for the largest voter fraud scheme in U.S. history.For ""the second time in a week,"" the Tampa Bay Times reports, Judge Walker has ""sided with the Democratic Party in a voting rights case in the nation's biggest battleground state.""Indeed, on Sunday, Judge Walker ruled that the state must provide a method for voters to fix signature problems on mail-in ballots before election day.Judge Walker's ruling on Sunday, the Miami Herald reports, was a win for the Democrat National Committee.""U.S. District Judge Mark Walker's ruling was a victory for the Florida Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee, which sued the state Oct. 3 arguing Florida canvassing boards shouldn't immediately reject a ballot if a voter's signature doesn't match the one on file,"" the Harald reported.Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudsonSIGN UP Wednesday Wednesday"	['Hudson', 'Obama']	[]

Pollak19 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEThis is a repeated claim deployed in defense of Planned Parenthood, but it is not true, at least as regards breast cancer. As the left-leaning Washington Post's fact-checker wrote in 2015:When Democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that Planned Parenthood ""provides"" mammograms, this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the X-rays. The group does not ""provide"" mammograms. Rather, the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies, X-rays or other specialized services. It is slightly more accurate to say that women have ""access"" to mammograms via Planned Parenthood, though it's still slippery language.The Post awarded Three Pinnochios (out of four) to the claim that Planned Parenthood provides mammograms.Planned Parenthood does offer Pap tests and HPV tests, which are screenings for cervical cancer.So the claim is not completely false, but mostly so.by John Hayward19 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEHillary Clinton was very uncomfortable with Donald Trump's gruesome description of the partial-birth abortion procedure, but Trump was correct. Pro-abortion activists don't like the term ""partial-birth abortion,"" preferring the more sanitized medical term ""dilation and extraction."" The basic idea behind the procedure is to remove the fetus partially from the womb, where it is most commonly killed by puncturing the skull with scissors or a similar implement. However, there is a ""dismemberment abortion"" variation on the procedure, which does indeed involve ripping the fetus apart, to reduce the danger to the mother from the hazardous partial-birth abortion procedure. As to how common such procedures are, there is some uncertainty about how often the procedure is used, but 500 to 1,000 per year is often cited as an estimate. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated there are about 10,000 late-term abortions (20 weeks or later) per year, but the vast majority of them are not partial-birth abortions.by Katie McHugh19 Oct 2016Fact-Check: True In a private, paid speech to a Brazilian bank on May 16, 2013, Clinton said: ""My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.""This secret speech was released as part of the Podesta emails obtained by Wikileaks. Furthermore, Clinton has worked tirelessly to claim otherwise in public, as Breitbart's Julia Hahn reported: The latest WikiLeaks revelation documenting Hillary Clinton's explicit support for ""open borders"" may pose unique challenges to her campaign, as it means that for months, Clinton's campaign has deliberately sought to mislead the American people about her position on immigration.Clinton's campaign website promoted material insisting that the ""claim that Hillary Clinton supports open borders"" is ""false""- even though, by Clinton's own admission, ""open borders"" is her ""dream.""Clinton's new pushback against publicly labeling herself as for ""open borders"" while clearly championing open border policies is perhaps related to the fact that increasing immigration levels is not a popular policy. According to Pew, an overwhelming 83 percent of the American electorate overall would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced....Fact-Check: HALF-TRUEIt is true that the Obama administration has blamed Russian hackers for Wikileaks. Russia, naturally, denies the charge (which it would certainly do, regardless).The fact that the Obama administration has pointed the finger at Russia is not, as lawyers like to say, ""dispositive."" The Centcom scandal showed that the Obama administration is fully prepared to alter intelligence -- even battlefield reports -- to deliver a politically convenient result. And there is nothing more convenient than to lay the embarrassment of Wikileaks at the feet of the Trump campaign. The New York Times, of all sources, wrote in July that it was not clear whether ""Guccifer,"" the hacker widely blamed for the leak of the Democratic National Committee's emails, was working for Russia or not:While WikiLeaks has not said how it obtained the emails, Guccifer 2.0 claimed in a blog post last month to have sent them to WikiLeaks....American intelligence officials believe that Guccifer 2.0 is a front for the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence service, according to federal officials briefed on the investigation.In blog posts, Twitter messages, and electronic chats with journalists, Guccifer 2.0 has insisted such skeptics are wrong.Clinton took her claim further, claiming that Trump actively wanted Russia to conduct espionage against the United States. That part of the statement is false, and relies on a joke Trump made in July, in response to prodding by journalists, that he hoped the Russians would find Hillary Clinton's missing emails, because no one else would.So while it is reasonable to conclude that Russia might be responsible, it is wrong to conclude that with certainty, and certainly wrong to tie Russian hacking to Trump without any real evidence.by Frances Martel19 Oct 2016Fact-check: TRUEIn response to a question from moderator Chris Wallace about a private speech Clinton gave in which she said she favored ""open borders,"" Clinton condemned Wikileaks as an ally of Russia. Trump dismissed this as a distraction from the original question.""She wants open borders... people are going to come in from Syria,"" he argued. ""He wants 550% more people than Barack Obama and he has thousands and thousands of people and they have no idea where they come from.""The issue of what percentage of an increase in the number of Syrian refugees being granted asylum in the United States Clinton would prefer has been one of the most prominent issues regarding immigration in this campaign. The White House announced in August that the United States had admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees, the upper limit in the number acceptable to the Obama administration so far.A month later, Clinton said in an interview on CBS that she believed that number to be far too low. ""I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in,"" she said in September.The website Politifact, checking Trump's claim that Clinton was seeking a 500% increase in the number of refugees from Syria, found the actual number based on her September statements to be 550%.by Jerome Hudson19 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEIn September 2006, then-Senator Hillary Clinton voted in favor of building a 700-mile wall along the Mexican border, for the purpose of stopping illegal immigrants from entering the United States.Indeed, the Secure Fence Act of 2006's goal was to ""help secure America's borders to decrease illegal entry, drug trafficking, and security threats by building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers along the Mexico-United States border.""Clinton voted ""yea"" in support of this bill. In effort to justify her support for more border security, Clinton told the Council on Foreign Relations that ""there isn't any sensible approach except to do what we need to do simultaneously: you know, secure our borders with technology and personnel, physical barriers if necessary in some places.""It is certainly true that Clinton wants to overturn the 2010 Supreme Court decision that allowed corporations (and unions) to speak freely about elections. (And that's no surprise, given that the case was about an attempt by the Federal Election Commission to suppress a movie critical of her.)But as far as the broader cause of campaign finance reform, Clinton is one of the worst offenders when it comes to fundraising from dubious sources and defying the boundaries of campaign finance law. An internal campaign email released by Wikileaks showed Clinton staffers insisting that Americans registered as lobbyists for foreign governments should be allowed to donate: ""Take the money!!"" one wrote.  In addition, a new video from James O'Keefe and Project Veritas this week provided evidence that the Clinton campaign was coordinating with super PACs through a system of intermediaries that one consultant dubbed the ""Pony Express."" That is an alleged violation of campaign finance law, and allows ""dark money"" to 501(c)4 groups like Americans United for Change to be spent on the campaign's behalf.by AWR Hawkins19 Oct 2016Fact-Check: FALSEWhen Clinton made this statement she was responding to a question about the District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) decision: a decision dealing with the foundations of the Second Amendment; the very roots of what it protects. In the Heller ruling, SCOTUS reaffirmed that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. This decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia, politics and journalism trying to persuade Americans that the Second Amendment protects a collective right. (If collective, the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or today's military or police forces.)So Heller is crucial. In fact, it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire Second Amendment rests on it. Yet Hillary disagrees the Heller ruling. Her spokesman Josh Schwerin said Hillary believes Heller was ""wrongly decided."" So how can a woman who does not believe in an ""individual"" right to keep and bear arms support the Second Amendment? She can't.Incidentally, Clinton made this point evident during the debate when she said her disagreement with the Heller decision was the way the SCOTUS applied the Second Amendment in that case. For those of you who may not know, Heller centered on Washington DC's gun ban-which was subsequently struck down via the SCOTUS decision. To oppose the application of the Second Amendment in Heller is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned. That is not supporting the Second Amendment.

""The majority of the people who live below the poverty level do not work,"" noted the Center for Poverty Research at the University of California Davis, reviewing labor from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. One of the observations made in their report was that a large majority of working poor had ""experienced at least one labor market problem"" during the year - i.e. they were unemployed, or forced to work part-time. Certainly some people who work full-time meet the definition of poverty - a definition that is politically elastic, since it is often calculated in a way that excludes the considerable value of state and federal subsidy programs. The poverty rate among working adults has been estimated at around 23 percent. A great deal depends on other factors, such as the age of the individual, whether they are raising a family, and where they live.The question of whether raising the minimum wage reduces poverty is highly contested - there have been studies both for, and against, that conclusion. Even advocates concede that jobs are lost when minimum wages rise, and those losses tend to hit the very people who most need full-time work to pull themselves up from poverty. Critics of minimum wage increases point out that even those who keep their jobs are often forced to pay more for their essential needs, precisely because labor costs have increased - described as a ""regressive hidden tax"" - and those higher costs tend to hit poor families harder than affluent ones.The situation simply is not as simple as ""raise the minimum wage, and people will make more money."" Complex unintended consequences must be considered, and minimum wage increases should be measured against other, potentially more efficient and less costly, means of alleviating poverty.Fact-Check: FALSEIndeed, Hillary Clinton's claim is not even close to true. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicts that under Clinton's policies, the debt would increase by $9 trillion over a decade.""Clinton's plan would increase both spending and revenue,"" the Washington, D.C.-based independent non-profit's analyst said. ""Under our preliminary updated central estimate, she would increase primary spending by $1.65 trillion over the next decade, including about $500 billion of spending on college education, $300 billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure, and significant new health-related spending."" Fact-Check: HALF-FALSETrump denied having said any of the comments she attributed to him at the last debate. That is correct: he did not say any of those things at the debate itself.But he did crack jokes at their expense in subsequent speeches, in repartee with the audience.In one speech, he said of a People writer who accused him: ""Take a look, you take a look. Look at her, look at her words. You tell me, what you think. I don't think so. I don't think so.""In another he mocked Clinton's claim that he ""stalked"" her onstage at the second debate -- by mocking her appearance: ""She walks in front of me, you know?  And when she walked in front of me - believe me, I wasn't impressed.""It should be noted that the Clintons also tried to dismiss the initial allegations about Monica Lewinsky in 1998 by mocking her appearance. Clinton adviser James Carville also infamously mocked Clinton accuser Paula Jones' working-class origins: ""Drag a hundred dollars through a trailer park and there's no telling what you'll find.""Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUETax reform proposals tend to be complicated, and there is disagreement about their projected effects, but as the Wall Street Journal described Clinton's proposal: The proposal calls for taxes on gains from investments held for less than two years to nearly double to the standard income-tax rate of 39.6%. The rate would gradually drop, reaching 20% for investments held at least six years. Under current law, the 20% rate is available for top earners if they hold investments for at least one year. These figures don't count an extra 3.8% tax on net investment income for upper-income earners included as part of the health-care law.So, not ""more than double,"" but ""nearly double,"" with a gradual drop in the rate over six years - the latest effort by politicians to micro-manage the ""free market"" and control investment decisions. (The Wall Street Journal quoted some analysts who doubted Clinton's plan would either raise the tax money she wants, or affect investment decisions the way she anticipates.)This is a claim Clinton often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control; to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the American people safe. However, a Fact-Check shows Clinton's claim is not only false, but is exaggerated by 66 percent. She is using figures from 2013, and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year. Clinton first began making this claim in November 2015, repeated it in April 2016, and has since repeated it again and again.In April Breitbart News highlighted the method Clinton used to swell the numbers:In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 11,208 firearm-related homicides in the United States. An additional 505 accidental firearm-related deaths occurred in the US-a figure that pales in comparison to the 38,851 deaths by accidental poisoning or the 30,208 deaths caused by falls. So Clinton and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides. In this way, 11,713 firearm-related deaths-homicides and accidental deaths-quickly become 32,888 ""gun violence"" deaths in 2013 and an impetus for gun control.This repeated Democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through Obama's first year in office, after the $862 billion stimulus, the massive omnibus spending bill (""porkulus""), and the deployment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which was signed by Obama's predecessor but for which he voted.As Breitbart News noted when President Obama claimed in January to have cut the deficit by ""almost three-quarters"":This is pure fiction. Obama has doubled the national debt, and it's not because he cut the deficit. Rather, he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in office-which he assigns, dishonestly, to the previous fiscal year, under George W. Bush. He ""cut"" (i.e. spent more gradually) from that spending, but only under protest, after Republicans took the House in 2010.The truth is that Obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and ill-conceived experiment in Keynesian stimulus spending, much of which was wasted on priorities that helped Obama's political supporters -- especially the public sector unions -- but did little for the economy.""Look at her real record,"" Trump said. ""Take a look at Syria, take a look at the migration, take a look at Libya, take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS because her and Obama created this huge vacuum and a small group came out of that huge vacuum.""Trump argued of Iraq, ""we should have never gotten out the way they wanted to get out."" He noted that the Islamic State was now present in ""32 countries.""In 2014, The Long War Journal found that Islamic State operatives were active in 32 countries.Military leaders and analysts have argued in favor of Trump's claim that the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq emboldened regional jihadist groups, first and foremost the Islamic State. The Islamic State only formally became the group it is today, however, after Clinton stepped down from the State Department.""If we had stayed a little more engaged, I think maybe it might have been prevented,"" Army General Raymond T. Odierno, the former top U.S. military official in Iraq, said of the collapse of Iraq after 2011.""There is consensus among military practitioners -- traditionally, the last people in the world who want to go to war -- that leaving Iraq was a mistake,"" American Enterprise Institute analyst Michael Rubin has said of the situation.The Islamic State did not become the formidable jihadist group it is known as today until long after Clinton's tenure heading the State Department. It became the entity it is known as today (""the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant"") two months after Clinton departed, and two years after President Obama ordered a dramatic reduction in the U.S. presence in Iraq.While the group has existed in some form since 2003, it did not sever from its parent organization Al Qaeda and establish a caliphate in Syria and Iraq until shortly after Clinton vacated her position in the State Department in early 2013.In August 2013, the Washington Post referred to the still Al-Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group as ""by no means the largest of the loosely aligned rebel organizations battling to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,"" but one worth monitoring due to its prodigious growth in a short time. By February 2014 - a year after Clinton left office, Al Qaeda had severed ties with the group, condemning it.Obviously, Trump didn't mean ISIS has completely abandoned Mosul - he means the leadership had plenty of time to escape. U.S. military leaders seem to agree.""We've got indications that leaders have left. A lot of foreign fighters we expect will stay because they're not gonna be able to exfiltrate as easily as some of the local fighters or the local leadership,"" Major General Gary Volesky of the 101st Airborne told reporters in a Pentagon briefing from Baghdad on Wednesday.Volesky said this is similar to what ISIS leadership has done in other cities, such as Ramadi and Fallujah - a fact the U.S. is reminding Islamic State jihadis of, to weaken their morale.""We're telling Daesh that their leaders are abandoning them. We've seen the movement out of Mosul. Where they are going, I will leave that to our targeteers,"" he said.As for the big prize, ISIS ""caliph"" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Volesky said it was not clear if he was in Mosul. A Kurdish official told the UK Express on Wednesday that the Kurds believe Baghdadi is still holed up somewhere in the city.Wallace corrected Trump, stating that Aleppo had not fallen to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies. Trump rejected that correction, stating once again that Aleppo had ""fallen"" and repeatedly asking Wallace of the city, ""have you seen it?""While Trump may have meant to use the term ""fallen"" to describe the state of affairs in the city - its crumbling buildings, near total lack of functional infrastructure, and a serious medical crisis as hospitals have become the targets of Russian airstrikes - politically, the rebels controlling Aleppo have not surrendered. Aleppo has not ""fallen"" to Assad.The anti-Assad rebels fighting in the city had their latest chance to surrender earlier this week, when Russia and Damascus announced a short-term ceasefire to allow rebels who no longer want to fight to abandon the city.""When we took up arms at the start of the revolution to defend our abandoned people we promised God that we would not lay them down until the downfall of this criminal regime,"" Syrian rebel militia leader Al-Farouk Abu Bakr said Tuesday in response to the ceasefire.Another rebel leader, Zakaria Malahifji, put it more plainly: ""he factions completely reject any exit - this is surrender.""Fact-Check: HALF TRUEThe Wall Street Journal noted in the summer of 2015 that the long-term outlook for Medicare (and Social Security) was ""better, but still bleak."" According to the trustees, the long-term deficits of the program had been reduced slightly, but how much the ACA contributed was a matter of contention. Health care costs were trending down before ObamaCare, a decline attributed by some to the softening economy. Former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius claimed the ACA was strengthening Medicare in 2013, but the trustees actually said the amount of cost slowdown attributable to ObamaCare could not be specified. (This would, conversely, make it difficult to determine the effect on Medicare insolvency if ObamaCare is repealed, especially without knowing what would replace it.)The hospital-insurance program, for example, was projected to run out of funds in 2017 when President Obama took office; it is now expected to be able to pay full benefits for the elderly and disabled through 2030.""The hospital-insurance program is separate from other Medicare programs, which include outpatient care and prescription drugs. Those are covered by premiums and government spending, not a trust fund,"" the WSJ noted.When the 2016 report from the Medicare trustees was issued, the hospital insurance fund's situation had gotten worse - it is now projected to exhaust its reserves by 2028. Fact-Check: TRUETrump, in fact, mentioned that the Clinton Foundation took money from Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Indeed, Saudi Arabia has donated up to $50 million to the Clinton Foundation, despite there horrid human rights. In fact, Hillary Clinton's own Sate Department criticized Saudi Arabia for its ""lack of equal rights for women and children"" and said human trafficking and violence against women are ""common"" in that country. Qatar donated $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation despite Clinton being well aware of the country's horrific record of violence against women. Qatar, has ""continuing human rights concerns,"" according to a 2012 report released by Hillary Clinton's State Department. Those human rights restrictions include ""freedom of religion ... trafficking in persons ... legal, institutional, and cultural discrimination against women limited their participation in society.""Fact-Check: FALSEIndeed, Clinton's ""ninety percent"" claim is false according to her troubled charity's own tax filings.Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large, and author of Clinton Cash said the Clinton Foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors.""If you actually look at the numbers of their filings and 990s, that's what it indicates,"" Schweizer said last month in an interview with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily. ""The Clinton Foundation will say, 'We assisted or facilitated in 100,000 kids getting immunizations.' Well, okay, what does that mean? And they don't really tell you. They don't really explain to you how it works.""""So the number is absolutely correct, that six percent goes to other charities,"" Schweizer continued. ""The other 94 percent is in this stew of marketing, and management, and travel expenses, and sort of all these obscure things, that it's really hard to dissect what is the end result of that 94 percent being spent.""What's more? Political analyst Sean Davis, the co-founder of The Federalist and a former adviser to Sen. Tom Coburn and Gov. Rick Perry, examined the Clinton Foundation's 2013 tax filings and found that ""Hillary Clinton's non-profit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants."" ""The Clinton Foundation spent nearly $8.5 million-10 percent of all 2013 expenditures-on travel,"" Davis contends. ""Nearly $4.8 million-5.6 percent of all expenditures-was spent on office supplies.""
This factoid is a hardy perennial on both Left and Right, with the latter sometimes invoking it to argue that President Obama has done a very poor job of combating ""income inequality,"" or that Obama's presidency proves not even the most dedicated leftist can fix income inequality through redistributionist government policies.Various estimates have held that the ""top one percent"" received 90 or 95 percent of the income gains during the Obama presidency. It should be noted, however, that the gains became more evenly spread over the last two years, as the job market began shaking off its paralysis.There have been many challenges to the ""Top one percent got most of the income gains"" statistic over the years, including the argument that measuring income is not the most accurate way to determine economic inequality. Also, the recovery of the stock market after the 2008 financial crisis was a major reason for these income benefits accruing to the rich, and a healthy stock market is often touted by supporters of President Obama as proof that his policies were working. It's rather hypocritical for Democrats to attack the logical end result of something they've presented as an economic benefit: people who own stocks making a lot of money from the recovering stock market. Some of those same people lost a lot of money when it went down.But Clinton portrayed these top earners as essentially criminals who must be punished. She certainly wasn't blaming Obama's policies for the situation:We are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.Yes, top earners indisputably received the lion's share of income growth from the post-2008 recovery, but the reasons why are far more complicated than the purely predatory behavior Clinton implies.by Joel B. Pollak20 Oct 2016James O'Keefe's recent video sting with Project Veritas revealed that contractors for the Hillary Clinton campaign used trained activists -- in some cases paid, in other cases volunteers -- to disrupt Donald Trump rallies. The activists were used to ""cause fights,"" as Trump said, with the goal of creating ""anarchy"" around the candidate. Trump went a bit too far in describing the tactic, however. He said:Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. It is important to note that the activists were not told to ""be violent,"" but rather to incite violence. And the figure of $1,500 appears to refer to one case, not to the general tactic used.Clinton's defenders might claim she did not know anything about the tactics being used, but that defense does not suffice. The consultants who carried out the tactic, centered around Robert Creamer and his Democracy Partners organization, told O'Keefe's undercover investigators that they had set up a ""double-blind"" system so that Clinton would not have to know directly about any particular action being taken on her behalf, but Creamer appeared to admit on video that Clinton had general knowledge about their activities.
When Democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that Planned Parenthood ""provides"" mammograms, this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the X-rays. The group does not ""provide"" mammograms. Rather, the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies, X-rays or other specialized services. It is slightly more accurate to say that women have ""access"" to mammograms via Planned Parenthood, though it's still slippery language.
The latest WikiLeaks revelation documenting Hillary Clinton's explicit support for ""open borders"" may pose unique challenges to her campaign, as it means that for months, Clinton's campaign has deliberately sought to mislead the American people about her position on immigration.
Clinton's campaign website promoted material insisting that the ""claim that Hillary Clinton supports open borders"" is ""false""- even though, by Clinton's own admission, ""open borders"" is her ""dream.""
Clinton's new pushback against publicly labeling herself as for ""open borders"" while clearly championing open border policies is perhaps related to the fact that increasing immigration levels is not a popular policy. According to Pew, an overwhelming 83 percent of the American electorate overall would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.

Interestingly, these so-called ""fact checks"" rarely mention how many migrants would be imported into the country under a Hillary Clinton Presidency. While Bill Clinton has described our current immigration policy as one of ""open borders,"" his wife has championed policies that would open our borders even further.
For example, the 2013 Gang of Eight bill Clinton supported would have tripled green card issuances--permanently resettling 33 million foreign nationals on green cards in the span of a single decade--and would have doubled foreign guest worker visas to compete for American jobs.
The 2006 Ted Kennedy immigration plan Clinton supported would have more than doubled legal immigration by increasing the number of family-based and employment-based visas.
Clinton's refugee program, which she outlined in 2015, calls for a 550 percent increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted. If Clinton were to continue this policy throughout her presidency, the U.S. could potentially permanently resettle nearly one million Muslim migrants during the first term of her presidency alone--and all of their children born on American soil would be automatically awarded U.S. citizenship.
The Center for Immigration Studies' Steve Camarota has projected that, based on the minimal figures Clinton has put forth thus far, Clinton could add 10 million new immigrants to the U.S. during her first term alone - in addition to the 11 million illegal immigrants Clinton has said she plans to amnesty within her first 100 days in office.


While WikiLeaks has not said how it obtained the emails, Guccifer 2.0 claimed in a blog post last month to have sent them to WikiLeaks.

American intelligence officials believe that Guccifer 2.0 is a front for the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence service, according to federal officials briefed on the investigation.
In blog posts, Twitter messages, and electronic chats with journalists, Guccifer 2.0 has insisted such skeptics are wrong.

The rate would gradually drop, reaching 20% for investments held at least six years. Under current law, the 20% rate is available for top earners if they hold investments for at least one year. These figures don't count an extra 3.8% tax on net investment income for upper-income earners included as part of the health-care law.

This is pure fiction. Obama has doubled the national debt, and it's not because he cut the deficit. Rather, he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in office-which he assigns, dishonestly, to the previous fiscal year, under George W. Bush. He ""cut"" (i.e. spent more gradually) from that spending, but only under protest, after Republicans took the House in 2010.

We are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.

Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.
...
And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. 
BREITBART LIVEby Joel B. Pollakby19 Oct 2016Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton claimed in the third presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday that Planned Parenthood ""provides cancer screenings"" and therefore should not be de-funded, in spite of controversy about abortion.Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEThis is a repeated claim deployed in defense of Planned Parenthood, but it is not true, at least as regards breast cancer. As the left-leaning Washington Post's fact-checker wrote in 2015:wroteWhen Democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that Planned Parenthood ""provides"" mammograms, this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the X-rays. The group does not ""provide"" mammograms. Rather, the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies, X-rays or other specialized services. It is slightly more accurate to say that women have ""access"" to mammograms via Planned Parenthood, though it's still slippery language.The Post awarded Three Pinnochios (out of four) to the claim that Planned Parenthood provides mammograms.Planned Parenthood does offer Pap tests and HPV tests, which are screenings for cervical cancer.So the claim is not completely false, but mostly so.by John HaywardAt the third presidential debate, Donald Trump spoke of partial-birth abortions ripping babies apart.Fact-Check: TRUEHillary Clinton was very uncomfortable with Donald Trump's gruesome description of the partial-birth abortion procedure, but Trump was correct. Pro-abortion activists don't like the term ""partial-birth abortion,"" preferring the more sanitized medical term ""dilation and extraction."" The basic idea behind the procedure is to remove the fetus partially from the womb, where it is most commonly killed by puncturing the skull with scissors or a similar implement. However, there is a ""dismemberment abortion"" variation on the procedure, which does indeed involve ripping the fetus apart, to reduce the danger to the mother from the hazardous partial-birth abortion procedure. dismemberment abortionAs to how common such procedures are, there is some uncertainty about how often the procedure is used, but 500 to 1,000 per year is often cited as an estimate. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated there are about 10,000 late-term abortions (20 weeks or later) per year, but the vast majority of them are not partial-birth abortions.500 to 1,000 per yearestimatedby Katie McHughDuring the final presidential debate, Donald Trump stated: ""Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders."" Fact-Check: True In a private, paid speech to a Brazilian bank on May 16, 2013, Clinton said: ""My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.""This secret speech was released as part of the Podesta emails obtained by Wikileaks. Furthermore, Clinton has worked tirelessly to claim otherwise in public, as Breitbart's Julia Hahn reported: During the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton evaded a question about her speech to a Brazilian bank advocating ""open borders,"" which was released by Wikileaks, by blaming Russia for the hack.Fact-Check: HALF-TRUEIt is true that the Obama administration has blamed Russian hackers for Wikileaks. Russia, naturally, denies the charge (which it would certainly do, regardless).The fact that the Obama administration has pointed the finger at Russia is not, as lawyers like to say, ""dispositive."" The Centcom scandal showed that the Obama administration is fully prepared to alter intelligence -- even battlefield reports -- to deliver a politically convenient result. And there is nothing more convenient than to lay the embarrassment of Wikileaks at the feet of the Trump campaign.Centcom scandal The New York Times, of all sources, wrote in July that it was not clear whether ""Guccifer,"" the hacker widely blamed for the leak of the Democratic National Committee's emails, was working for Russia or not:New York TimesWhile WikiLeaks has not said how it obtained the emails, Guccifer 2.0 claimed in a blog post last month to have sent them to WikiLeaks....American intelligence officials believe that Guccifer 2.0 is a front for the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence service, according to federal officials briefed on the investigation.In blog posts, Twitter messages, and electronic chats with journalists, Guccifer 2.0 has insisted such skeptics are wrong.Clinton took her claim further, claiming that Trump actively wanted Russia to conduct espionage against the United States. That part of the statement is false, and relies on a joke Trump made in July, in response to prodding by journalists, that he hoped the Russians would find Hillary Clinton's missing emails, because no one else would.jokeSo while it is reasonable to conclude that Russia might be responsible, it is wrong to conclude that with certainty, and certainly wrong to tie Russian hacking to Trump without any real evidence.by Frances MartelDuring Wednesday night's presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump asserted that his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in the number of Syrian refugees entering the United States.Fact-check: TRUEIn response to a question from moderator Chris Wallace about a private speech Clinton gave in which she said she favored ""open borders,"" Clinton condemned Wikileaks as an ally of Russia. Trump dismissed this as a distraction from the original question.""She wants open borders... people are going to come in from Syria,"" he argued. ""He wants 550% more people than Barack Obama and he has thousands and thousands of people and they have no idea where they come from.""The issue of what percentage of an increase in the number of Syrian refugees being granted asylum in the United States Clinton would prefer has been one of the most prominent issues regarding immigration in this campaign. The White House announced in August that the United States had admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees, the upper limit in the number acceptable to the Obama administration so far.admitted 10,000 Syrian refugeesA month later, Clinton said in an interview on CBS that she believed that number to be far too low. ""I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in,"" she said in September.said in SeptemberThe website Politifact, checking Trump's claim that Clinton was seeking a 500% increase in the number of refugees from Syria, found the actual number based on her September statements to be 550%.Politifactby Jerome HudsonRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump said during the third presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday that Hillary Clinton ""wanted the wall"" when she a U.S. senator from New York. In September 2006, then-Senator Hillary Clinton voted in favor of building a 700-mile wall along the Mexican border, for the purpose of stopping illegal immigrants from entering the United States.Indeed, the Secure Fence Act of 2006's goal was to ""help secure America's borders to decrease illegal entry, drug trafficking, and security threats by building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers along the Mexico-United States border.""Secure Fence Act of 2006Clinton voted ""yea"" in support of this bill. yeaIn effort to justify her support for more border security, Clinton told the Council on Foreign Relations that ""there isn't any sensible approach except to do what we need to do simultaneously: you know, secure our borders with technology and personnel, physical barriers if necessary in some places.""toldDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said at the third presidential debate that she wanted to ""stand up against Citizens United.""It is certainly true that Clinton wants to overturn the 2010 Supreme Court decision that allowed corporations (and unions) to speak freely about elections. (And that's no surprise, given that the case was about an attempt by the Federal Election Commission to suppress a movie critical of her.)But as far as the broader cause of campaign finance reform, Clinton is one of the worst offenders when it comes to fundraising from dubious sources and defying the boundaries of campaign finance law. An internal campaign email released by Wikileaks showed Clinton staffers insisting that Americans registered as lobbyists for foreign governments should be allowed to donate: ""Take the money!!"" one wrote. showedIn addition, a new video from James O'Keefe and Project Veritas this week provided evidence that the Clinton campaign was coordinating with super PACs through a system of intermediaries that one consultant dubbed the ""Pony Express."" That is an alleged violation of campaign finance law, and allows ""dark money"" to 501(c)4 groups like Americans United for Change to be spent on the campaign's behalf.evidenceby AWR HawkinsDuring the third presidential debate, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton responded to a question about Supreme Court and gun rights by saying, ""I support the Second Amendment.""Fact-Check: FALSEWhen Clinton made this statement she was responding to a question about the District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) decision: a decision dealing with the foundations of the Second Amendment; the very roots of what it protects. In the Heller ruling, SCOTUS reaffirmed that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. This decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia, politics and journalism trying to persuade Americans that the Second Amendment protects a collective right. (If collective, the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or today's military or police forces.)So Heller is crucial. In fact, it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire Second Amendment rests on it. Yet Hillary disagrees the Heller ruling. Her spokesman Josh Schwerin said Hillary believes Heller was ""wrongly decided."" wrongly decidedSo how can a woman who does not believe in an ""individual"" right to keep and bear arms support the Second Amendment? She can't.Incidentally, Clinton made this point evident during the debate when she said her disagreement with the Heller decision was the way the SCOTUS applied the Second Amendment in that case. For those of you who may not know, Heller centered on Washington DC's gun ban-which was subsequently struck down via the SCOTUS decision. To oppose the application of the Second Amendment in Heller is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned. That is not supporting the Second Amendment.

Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins. Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart.com.Bullets with AWR Hawkins@AWRHawkinsawrhawkins@breitbart.comDuring the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton talked about raising the minimum wage because ""people who work full time should not live in poverty.""Certainly most would agree that full-time workers should not experience poverty, but the question is whether they do now, and whether raising the minimum wage would effectively address the problem. ""The majority of the people who live below the poverty level do not work,"" noted the Center for Poverty Research at the University of California Davis, reviewing labor from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. One of the observations made in their report was that a large majority of working poor had ""experienced at least one labor market problem"" during the year - i.e. they were unemployed, or forced to work part-time. Center for Poverty ResearchCertainly some people who work full-time meet the definition of poverty - a definition that is politically elastic, since it is often calculated in a way that excludes the considerable value of state and federal subsidy programs. The poverty rate among working adults has been estimated at around 23 percent. A great deal depends on other factors, such as the age of the individual, whether they are raising a family, and where they live.The question of whether raising the minimum wage reduces poverty is highly contested - there have been studies both for, and against, that conclusion. Even advocates concede that jobs are lost when minimum wages rise, and those losses tend to hit the very people who most need full-time work to pull themselves up from poverty. Critics of minimum wage increases point out that even those who keep their jobs are often forced to pay more for their essential needs, precisely because labor costs have increased - described as a ""regressive hidden tax"" - and those higher costs tend to hit poor families harder than affluent ones.foragainstThe situation simply is not as simple as ""raise the minimum wage, and people will make more money."" Complex unintended consequences must be considered, and minimum wage increases should be measured against other, potentially more efficient and less costly, means of alleviating poverty.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said during the third presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday that she ""will not add a penny to the debt"" if elected president. Fact-Check: FALSEIndeed, Hillary Clinton's claim is not even close to true. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicts that under Clinton's policies, the debt would increase by $9 trillion over a decade.predicts that under Clinton's policies""Clinton's plan would increase both spending and revenue,"" the Washington, D.C.-based independent non-profit's analyst said. ""Under our preliminary updated central estimate, she would increase primary spending by $1.65 trillion over the next decade, including about $500 billion of spending on college education, $300 billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure, and significant new health-related spending."" analyst saidDuring the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed that at the previous debate, Donald Trump mocked the appearance of some of the women who suddenly claimed to have been the target of his sexual advances.Fact-Check: HALF-FALSETrump denied having said any of the comments she attributed to him at the last debate. That is correct: he did not say any of those things at the debate itself.But he did crack jokes at their expense in subsequent speeches, in repartee with the audience.In one speech, he said of a People writer who accused him: ""Take a look, you take a look. Look at her, look at her words. You tell me, what you think. I don't think so. I don't think so.""speechIn another he mocked Clinton's claim that he ""stalked"" her onstage at the second debate -- by mocking her appearance: ""She walks in front of me, you know?  And when she walked in front of me - believe me, I wasn't impressed.""mockedIt should be noted that the Clintons also tried to dismiss the initial allegations about Monica Lewinsky in 1998 by mocking her appearance. Clinton adviser James Carville also infamously mocked Clinton accuser Paula Jones' working-class origins: ""Drag a hundred dollars through a trailer park and there's no telling what you'll find.""During the third presidential debate, Donald Trump said that Hillary Clinton's plan would ""more than double"" capital gains taxes.Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUETax reform proposals tend to be complicated, and there is disagreement about their projected effects, but as the Wall Street Journal described Clinton's proposal: Wall Street JournalThe proposal calls for taxes on gains from investments held for less than two years to nearly double to the standard income-tax rate of 39.6%. The rate would gradually drop, reaching 20% for investments held at least six years. Under current law, the 20% rate is available for top earners if they hold investments for at least one year. These figures don't count an extra 3.8% tax on net investment income for upper-income earners included as part of the health-care law.So, not ""more than double,"" but ""nearly double,"" with a gradual drop in the rate over six years - the latest effort by politicians to micro-manage the ""free market"" and control investment decisions. (The Wall Street Journal quoted some analysts who doubted Clinton's plan would either raise the tax money she wants, or affect investment decisions the way she anticipates.)During the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed that ""33,000 people a year...die from guns."" This is a claim Clinton often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control; to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the American people safe. However, a Fact-Check shows Clinton's claim is not only false, but is exaggerated by 66 percent. She is using figures from 2013, and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year. Clinton first began making this claim in November 2015, repeated it in April 2016, and has since repeated it again and again.In April Breitbart News highlighted the method Clinton used to swell the numbers:Breitbart News highlightedIn 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 11,208 firearm-related homicides in the United States. An additional 505 accidental firearm-related deaths occurred in the US-a figure that pales in comparison to the 38,851 deaths by accidental poisoning or the 30,208 deaths caused by falls. So Clinton and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides. In this way, 11,713 firearm-related deaths-homicides and accidental deaths-quickly become 32,888 ""gun violence"" deaths in 2013 and an impetus for gun control.Centers for Disease Control and PreventionDuring the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton praised President Obama's economic performance, adding: ""He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.""This repeated Democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through Obama's first year in office, after the $862 billion stimulus, the massive omnibus spending bill (""porkulus""), and the deployment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which was signed by Obama's predecessor but for which he voted.As Breitbart News noted when President Obama claimed in January to have cut the deficit by ""almost three-quarters"":notedThis is pure fiction. Obama has doubled the national debt, and it's not because he cut the deficit. Rather, he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in office-which he assigns, dishonestly, to the previous fiscal year, under George W. Bush. He ""cut"" (i.e. spent more gradually) from that spending, but only under protest, after Republicans took the House in 2010.The truth is that Obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and ill-conceived experiment in Keynesian stimulus spending, much of which was wasted on priorities that helped Obama's political supporters -- especially the public sector unions -- but did little for the economy.During Wednesday night's final 2016 presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump repeatedly asserted that rival Hillary Clinton, in her capacity as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, ""gave us ISIS.""""Look at her real record,"" Trump said. ""Take a look at Syria, take a look at the migration, take a look at Libya, take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS because her and Obama created this huge vacuum and a small group came out of that huge vacuum.""Trump argued of Iraq, ""we should have never gotten out the way they wanted to get out."" He noted that the Islamic State was now present in ""32 countries.""In 2014, The Long War Journal found that Islamic State operatives were active in 32 countries.foundMilitary leaders and analysts have argued in favor of Trump's claim that the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq emboldened regional jihadist groups, first and foremost the Islamic State. The Islamic State only formally became the group it is today, however, after Clinton stepped down from the State Department.have argued in favor""If we had stayed a little more engaged, I think maybe it might have been prevented,"" Army General Raymond T. Odierno, the former top U.S. military official in Iraq, said of the collapse of Iraq after 2011.""There is consensus among military practitioners -- traditionally, the last people in the world who want to go to war -- that leaving Iraq was a mistake,"" American Enterprise Institute analyst Michael Rubin has said of the situation.The Islamic State did not become the formidable jihadist group it is known as today until long after Clinton's tenure heading the State Department. It became the entity it is known as today (""the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant"") two months after Clinton departed, and two years after President Obama ordered a dramatic reduction in the U.S. presence in Iraq.after Clinton departedWhile the group has existed in some form since 2003, it did not sever from its parent organization Al Qaeda and establish a caliphate in Syria and Iraq until shortly after Clinton vacated her position in the State Department in early 2013.existed in some form since 2003In August 2013, the Washington Post referred to the still Al-Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group as ""by no means the largest of the loosely aligned rebel organizations battling to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,"" but one worth monitoring due to its prodigious growth in a short time. By February 2014 - a year after Clinton left office, Al Qaeda had severed ties with the group, condemning it.referredsevered tiesDuring the third presidential debate, Donald Trump complained about telegraphing major military actions such as the invasion of Mosul for months, and said ""these people have already left.""Obviously, Trump didn't mean ISIS has completely abandoned Mosul - he means the leadership had plenty of time to escape. U.S. military leaders seem to agree.""We've got indications that leaders have left. A lot of foreign fighters we expect will stay because they're not gonna be able to exfiltrate as easily as some of the local fighters or the local leadership,"" Major General Gary Volesky of the 101st Airborne told reporters in a Pentagon briefing from Baghdad on Wednesday.told reportersVolesky said this is similar to what ISIS leadership has done in other cities, such as Ramadi and Fallujah - a fact the U.S. is reminding Islamic State jihadis of, to weaken their morale.""We're telling Daesh that their leaders are abandoning them. We've seen the movement out of Mosul. Where they are going, I will leave that to our targeteers,"" he said.As for the big prize, ISIS ""caliph"" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Volesky said it was not clear if he was in Mosul. A Kurdish official told the UK Express on Wednesday that the Kurds believe Baghdadi is still holed up somewhere in the city.During Wednesday night's presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump refuted moderator Chris Wallace's assertion that Trump's claim that the Syrian city of Aleppo had ""fallen.""Wallace corrected Trump, stating that Aleppo had not fallen to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies. Trump rejected that correction, stating once again that Aleppo had ""fallen"" and repeatedly asking Wallace of the city, ""have you seen it?""While Trump may have meant to use the term ""fallen"" to describe the state of affairs in the city - its crumbling buildings, near total lack of functional infrastructure, and a serious medical crisis as hospitals have become the targets of Russian airstrikes - politically, the rebels controlling Aleppo have not surrendered. Aleppo has not ""fallen"" to Assad.total lack of functional infrastructurehospitals have become the targetsThe anti-Assad rebels fighting in the city had their latest chance to surrender earlier this week, when Russia and Damascus announced a short-term ceasefire to allow rebels who no longer want to fight to abandon the city.""When we took up arms at the start of the revolution to defend our abandoned people we promised God that we would not lay them down until the downfall of this criminal regime,"" Syrian rebel militia leader Al-Farouk Abu Bakr said Tuesday in response to the ceasefire.said TuesdayAnother rebel leader, Zakaria Malahifji, put it more plainly: ""he factions completely reject any exit - this is surrender.""During the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed the Affordable Care Act has ""extended the lifespan of the Medicare trust fund.""Fact-Check: HALF TRUEThe Wall Street Journal noted in the summer of 2015 that the long-term outlook for Medicare (and Social Security) was ""better, but still bleak."" According to the trustees, the long-term deficits of the program had been reduced slightly, but how much the ACA contributed was a matter of contention. Health care costs were trending down before ObamaCare, a decline attributed by some to the softening economy. Former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius claimed the ACA was strengthening Medicare in 2013, but the trustees actually said the amount of cost slowdown attributable to ObamaCare could not be specified. (This would, conversely, make it difficult to determine the effect on Medicare insolvency if ObamaCare is repealed, especially without knowing what would replace it.)claimedThe hospital-insurance program, for example, was projected to run out of funds in 2017 when President Obama took office; it is now expected to be able to pay full benefits for the elderly and disabled through 2030.""The hospital-insurance program is separate from other Medicare programs, which include outpatient care and prescription drugs. Those are covered by premiums and government spending, not a trust fund,"" the WSJ noted.When the 2016 report from the Medicare trustees was issued, the hospital insurance fund's situation had gotten worse - it is now projected to exhaust its reserves by 2028. now projectedRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump said during the third presidential debate that the Clinton Foundation accepted millions of dollars in donations from counties that ""treat women horribly.""Fact-Check: TRUETrump, in fact, mentioned that the Clinton Foundation took money from Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Indeed, Saudi Arabia has donated up to $50 million to the Clinton Foundation, despite there horrid human rights. In fact, Hillary Clinton's own Sate Department criticized Saudi Arabia for its ""lack of equal rights for women and children"" and said human trafficking and violence against women are ""common"" in that country. Saudi ArabiaHillary Clinton's own Sate Department criticized Saudi ArabiaQatar donated $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation despite Clinton being well aware of the country's horrific record of violence against women. Qatar, has ""continuing human rights concerns,"" according to a 2012 report released by Hillary Clinton's State Department. Those human rights restrictions include ""freedom of religion ... trafficking in persons ... legal, institutional, and cultural discrimination against women limited their participation in society.""report released by Hillary Clinton's State DepartmentDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said during the third presidential debate, ""We at the Clinton Foundation spend ninety percent -- ninety percent -- of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.""Indeed, Clinton's ""ninety percent"" claim is false according to her troubled charity's own tax filings.tax filingsPeter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large, and author of Clinton Cash said the Clinton Foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors.Government Accountability InstituteClinton Cash""If you actually look at the numbers of their filings and 990s, that's what it indicates,"" Schweizer said last month in an interview with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily. ""The Clinton Foundation will say, 'We assisted or facilitated in 100,000 kids getting immunizations.' Well, okay, what does that mean? And they don't really tell you. They don't really explain to you how it works.""Schweizer said""So the number is absolutely correct, that six percent goes to other charities,"" Schweizer continued. ""The other 94 percent is in this stew of marketing, and management, and travel expenses, and sort of all these obscure things, that it's really hard to dissect what is the end result of that 94 percent being spent.""What's more? Political analyst Sean Davis, the co-founder of The Federalist and a former adviser to Sen. Tom Coburn and Gov. Rick Perry, examined the Clinton Foundation's 2013 tax filings and found that ""Hillary Clinton's non-profit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants."" ""The Clinton Foundation spent nearly $8.5 million-10 percent of all 2013 expenditures-on travel,"" Davis contends. ""Nearly $4.8 million-5.6 percent of all expenditures-was spent on office supplies.""contendsDuring the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed that ""most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.""This factoid is a hardy perennial on both Left and Right, with the latter sometimes invoking it to argue that President Obama has done a very poor job of combating ""income inequality,"" or that Obama's presidency proves not even the most dedicated leftist can fix income inequality through redistributionist government policies.Various estimates have held that the ""top one percent"" received 90 or 95 percent of the income gains during the Obama presidency. It should be noted, however, that the gains became more evenly spread over the last two years, as the job market began shaking off its paralysis.9095 percentmore evenly spreadThere have been many challenges to the ""Top one percent got most of the income gains"" statistic over the years, including the argument that measuring income is not the most accurate way to determine economic inequality. Also, the recovery of the stock market after the 2008 financial crisis was a major reason for these income benefits accruing to the rich, and a healthy stock market is often touted by supporters of President Obama as proof that his policies were working. It's rather hypocritical for Democrats to attack the logical end result of something they've presented as an economic benefit: people who own stocks making a lot of money from the recovering stock market. Some of those same people lost a lot of money when it went down.But Clinton portrayed these top earners as essentially criminals who must be punished. She certainly wasn't blaming Obama's policies for the situation:We are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.Yes, top earners indisputably received the lion's share of income growth from the post-2008 recovery, but the reasons why are far more complicated than the purely predatory behavior Clinton implies.20 Oct 2016In answering a question about fitness for the presidency, Republican nominee Donald Trump claimed that the Hillary Clinton campaign paid protesters to ""be violent"" and to ""cause fights.""James O'Keefe's recent video sting with Project Veritas revealed that contractors for the Hillary Clinton campaign used trained activists -- in some cases paid, in other cases volunteers -- to disrupt Donald Trump rallies. The activists were used to ""cause fights,"" as Trump said, with the goal of creating ""anarchy"" around the candidate. recent video stingTrump went a bit too far in describing the tactic, however. He said:Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. It is important to note that the activists were not told to ""be violent,"" but rather to incite violence. And the figure of $1,500 appears to refer to one case, not to the general tactic used.Clinton's defenders might claim she did not know anything about the tactics being used, but that defense does not suffice. The consultants who carried out the tactic, centered around Robert Creamer and his Democracy Partners organization, told O'Keefe's undercover investigators that they had set up a ""double-blind"" system so that Clinton would not have to know directly about any particular action being taken on her behalf, but Creamer appeared to admit on video that Clinton had general knowledge about their activities."

When Tarkanian passed away in 2015, the lights on the Vegas Strip dimmed to honor him, and Tarkanian joined Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, Dean Martin, and George Burns as the only people who have ever received that honor.After his passing, writers observed that Tarkanian ""retroactively comes across as a guileless truth-teller in a world of sleaze and double-talk."" Tark the Shark ""viewed the system as anarchic"" and ""he went and became the king of the anarchists."" Yahoo Sports's Dan Wetzel noted that Tarkanian ""saw the NCAA as a fraud - a pretentious, overreaching organization that made millions by employing absurd 'amateurism' rules... He felt its leadership was concerned only with its own power and money, so it staked out some kind of moral high ground and bullied everyone, particularly poor black athletes."" Wetzel pointed out that ""out on the recruiting trail Tarkanian watched as just about every school in the country broke all the rules in the Wild, Wild West era ... paying players and parents, fixing grades, whatever. Yet only the small schools would get investigated and punished.""Tarkanian, Wetzel wrote, ""wasn't wrong."" But ""he just wasn't exactly the greatest messenger for the cause.""Like Tarkanian, Trump has had trouble becoming the perfect messenger in the general election for the anti-establishment cause that propelled his political rise. Tonight, Trump has his last, best chance to convince voters that he is the truth-telling outsider who is beholden to nobody and will destroy the corrupt bipartisan establishment that Clinton embodies.Here are some ways he can accomplish that.
1. TPP and H-1b:Though he has the support of disaffected blue-collar workers, many of whom have not regularly voted in elections and may be off the pollsters's radars, Trump needs to win over college-educated, white-collar suburban voters in the Philadelphia collar counties and places like Northern Virginia and North Carolina's Research Triangle if he has any chance of pulling off a November upset. Trump can appeal to both groups of voters by reminding professionals in the suburbs that their white-collar jobs, especially in technological fields, can just as easily disappear like blue-collar manufacturing jobs if globalists like Clinton in the permanent political class make it easier for companies to get more H-1b visas. Trump can unite suburban professionals and blue-collar workers in manufacturing and mill towns by highlighting his opposition to increases in H-1b visas and bad trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.2. The Outsider:Trump's greatest appeal is that he's the ultimate outsider and a blue-collar billionaire who will be beholden to nobody and stick it to the powers that be on behalf of American workers of all backgrounds. One of the most compelling aspects of Trump's announcement speech last year was when he talked about how his father doubted whether he could succeed in Manhattan. Trump said his father used to tell him, ""Donald, don't go into Manhattan. That's the big leagues. We don't know anything about that. Don't do it.""""I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I've gotta do it,"" Trump said he would often tell his dad. ""And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals--the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.""Trump hasn't talked about this much since. But he should do so often to remind voters that he, like them, has always been an outsider and will shake up the political system in their favor like he changed New York's skyline when even his father, let alone the established real estate interests in Manhattan, doubted his ability to do so. Talking about overcoming his father's doubts to succeed in Manhattan will humanize him and convince voters that he has always been a disruptor who can shake up the established order.3. Billy Bush Tape vs. Wikileaks:Who would have ever guessed that Billy Bush would be the member of the Bush family who would potentially derail Trump's campaign? When Trump's lewd remarks and the subsequent stream of sexual assault allegations against him inevitably come up in the debate, Trump's best argument may be to frame the race as a choice between an imperfect candidate who will always put America first and an imperfect candidate who has shown she will always put the interests of the global elite ahead of what's best for America.Trump can then cite many of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's hacked emails to remind voters that Clinton embraces open borders, has colluded with a political establishment that, like the NCAA Tark railed against, always protects its own, and embodies everything voters hate about the political establishment.4. America-First Businessman vs. Globalist Egghead: Trump too often comes across as the guy who gets lost and, even after an hour of driving around aimlessly, stubbornly insists he is not and refuses to ask for directions. That's not a quality that endears him to voters, especially women voters.It's obvious that Trump is not a master of policy minutiae. And that's not necessarily a bad thing because that's what staffers and wonks are for.When Trump is unsure about a policy question, he should just admit that he is not a master of policy details but he, unlike Clinton, will always put the interests of Americans  first (remind Americans that ""America First"" applies to Americans of all backgrounds--U.S.-born and legal immigrants--who are currently here) on terrorism, immigration, trade, and jobs. He can then pivot and portray Clinton as a so-called policy ""expert"" who has supported failed military adventures abroad and who will use her mastery of obscure rules and laws to benefit herself, her cronies and the global elites in the permanent political class instead of American workers. That's a winning message that allows Trump to turn his weakness on policy matters into a strength.
5. Minority voters:Trump's message to minority voters who may be hesitant to vote for him should be that though he may not have the best bedside manners, he is the doctor with the policy prescriptions who is best suited to cure their ailing communities.During the primary season, prominent black writers and pundits like Van Jones and Jamelle Bouie conceded that Trump's message on jobs and immigration could resonate with a significant number of black voters in the general election. To maximize the chances of his message getting through to minority communities, Trump should talk about how he opened his Mar-a-Lago club to blacks and Jews and how Palm Beach allegedly discriminated against his club because he integrated it.Trump can also tell minority voters that Democrats have been like the deadbeat parent/ex-significant other who always promises the world but never delivers. Trump can also show some humor and tell minorities that they could vote for him in private and do not need to tell their friends and family. Blue-collar minorities who may attend some rasslin' matches may be receptive to Trump's message that bad trade deals, the country's porous borders, and the breakdown of law and order are diminishing opportunities for them and those in their communities and consider voting for Trump to turn things around.But Trump also needs to reach out to minorities in the middle class who are not living paycheck to paycheck but are still a car accident or a medical emergency away from bankruptcy. He must remind these voters that their status in the middle class is at stake in this election if Clinton spends eight years in the White House putting Wall Street ahead of Main Street. He should tell these voters that his policies will send the elevator down to bring more minorities into the middle class while Clinton's globalists's-first policies will only jeopardize their hard-earned status in the middle class.--Before the first presidential debate, all of the momentum was on Trump's side. Trump was leading or within the margin of error in nearly every national poll and gaining in every swing state poll. Those polls may have been the worst thing to happen to Trump because he turned in a debate performance before a record audience that made him look like a rookie quarterback who never bothered to learn any of his team's plays and did not know what he did not know.But even as Trump has arguably had two of the worst weeks a presidential candidate has ever had, Clinton has not put the race away. And that may be a testament to how powerful Trump's America-First message is and how much voters still do not like and distrust Clinton. Though almost everything has gone against Trump after the first debate, it still seems like Trump is like the football team that has done everything it could to lose the game but still has the ball at its own ten-yard line, down only one score, with two minutes remaining. It's now up to Trump to actually make the argument for his candidacy--and against Clinton's--before the American people and not be remembered as the Ryan Leaf of politics.SIGN UP"	['Jones', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom TIME magazine:In my lifetime, I have never seen Congress so blatantly mock our Constitution. It's especially striking that it comes from the political party that's always lecturing us about the ""rule of law"". What's worse is that they're getting away with it. Republicans have turned this Constitutional issue into a political football and suckered the White House, Democrats in Congress and the news media into playing the game by their rules. This is a travesty of justice, but it has all but disappeared as a news story.I wonder what other Constitutional mandates Congress could just decide to ignore. Is it possible that the White House, the opposition party in Congress and the news media could be cowardly complacent, too frozen by fear to actually do anything to stop their overreach? They haven't in this situation. It's all ""politics,"" they say. Sound familiar? That's exactly what we said when Trump's campaign was just a joke. He won once. And could win again.So, could the Constitution be thwarted and black folk end up enslaved again? Legal scholars, of course, will find the question ludicrous and laughable.It wasn't farfetched for the young student who pressed me at Lehigh that evening. And, honestly? With the hair-raising, bone-chilling, spine-breaking, nerve-wracking path we're on right now, I shudder to think where this democracy could end up one sad day, if we don't get off this low road and make our way to higher ground soon.Read the rest here.

Democrats and the Clinton campaign -- by which I mean the media -- have thrown more slime and dirt at the Republican presidential nominee than any other politician in the history of television.Yet, Mr. Trump is still standing.Down in the polls, perhaps. But nowhere near where a lesser candidate or a weaker man would be if he had endured all that Mr. Trump has.The first 10 minutes of the last debate in St. Louis, where Mr. Trump stood on the stage against the entire world and stared it down and then began prosecuting the case against Hillary Clinton, was the greatest herculean effort successfully pulled off by any man in modern politics.His resilience is a testament to his own political instincts, his own willingness to take creative risks and his own monster stamina. It is also a testament to how desperately people believe in the political message that he alone identified and has forcefully pursued against a hurricane of universal opposition among elites.Nowhere is that opposition hotter and more strident than from fellow Republicans, who excoriated Mr. Trump early in the primary campaign when he initially balked at agreeing to support the eventual nominee.But today, it is Mitt Romney, John McCain and the entire Bush family who have abandoned the eventual nominee. Just about every Republican nominee for the past 30 years -- men whom Republicans supported despite all manner of reservations -- refuse to return that decency by supporting Mr. Trump.Each one of them has truly revealed himself.And now the media are shocked to hear all this talk about a ""rigged"" election. But, of course, it is rigged.The media overwhelmingly support Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats financially and in terms of campaign coverage.They cover the contested accusations against Mr. Trump endlessly while almost completely ignoring the raft of incontrovertible scandals revealed by the WikiLeaks document dump.Mrs. Clinton's campaign is as dirty and dastardly as the most sinister politician Hollywood could ever come up with.They pay dirty money to homeless people to incite violence at Trump rallies. Does it get any more slimy and cynical than that?The Democratic primary race was clearly rigged, with the Democratic National Committee brazenly conspiring to defeat Bernie Sanders and hand Mrs. Clinton the nomination.Mrs. Clinton's own top campaign officials -- according to the purloined emails -- believe Mrs. Clinton is a liar.And when speaking freely, Mrs. Clinton acknowledges that ""they can't possibly vet all those refugees"" from Syria that she openly wants to let into the country she is supposed to care about protecting.She is also all in favor of obliterating America's borders.""My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, sometime in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere,"" Mrs. Clinton said in a speech to an Italian bank that paid her $225,000.Add to all of this her reckless and near-criminal disregard for our nation's secrets and you have an anti-American, globalist liar who is more dangerous than the worst spies who spilled U.S. secrets to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.Now comes evidence that a high-ranking official in her State Department tried to barter a ""quid pro quo"" with FBI agents, asking them to alter evidence in a criminal investigation against Mrs. Clinton.Damn straight that is more serious than a two-bit break-in at the Watergate.* Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.SIGN UP"	['Sanders', 'McCain', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Hurt']	[]

During that period he has visited the POTUS himself at least 45 times, and in 2008 and 2012 ""he worked with the Democratic National Committee as a consultant to the Obama Presidential Campaign coordinating field-based rapid response to Republican Presidential candidates.""Bob Creamer is a self-described ""political organizer and strategist"" who is regularly referenced by Scott Foval in O'Keefe's videos as an organizational and communications linchpin. Foval says during the videos that Creamer and his group Democracy Partners was ""kind of the dark hat"" to Foval's ""white hat."" Foval also refers to Creamer as ""diabolical.""As Jen Lawrence from Breitbart News reported early Wednesday, the White House is following the lead of he Democratic National Committee in trying to scurry away from Creamer despite hundreds of visits to the White House:Creamer issued a statement after the first two videos that he was ""stepping back"" from his ""responsibilities working with the campaign.""

He asks if either will put U.S. troops in that vacuum so ISIS isn't replaced with something worse. Clinton says she will not support sending in U.S. troops. Trump is now wondering what happened to the ""element of surprise."" He says we shouldn't talk about attacking Mosul because the enemy will have already left. Trump says after we take Mosul, Iran should be writing us a letter of thank you because Iran will be even more empowered. Trump says Clinton took everyone out of Iraq to benefit Iran. Clinton says Trump is implying that he didn't support the Iraq War. She asks voters to Google ""Donald Trump Iraq."" Trump keeps saying ""wrong!"" Clinton says this matters because Trump has not told the truth about his position. Clinton says we need to after terrorist leaders in Mosul and ""it's going to be tough fighting.""

He grills Clinton on whether she kept her pledge to the Senate Committee when emails have shown numerous instances of pay-to-play scandals. Clinton says everything she did as Secretary of State was in furtherance of ""our interest.""She says the Clinton Foundation is a world-renowned foundation that does a lot of good charitable work in order to avoid the pay-to-play question. Trump says it's a ""criminal enterprise."" Trump says Clinton talks about women's rights while her foundation accepts money from countries that allows people to push gays off of buildings and kill women without repercussions. Trump says Clinton should return the money to those countries. Trump says he was in Little Haiti in Florida and they hate the Clintons because what happened in Haiti was a ""disgrace."" Clinton doing her best to give infomercials about her foundation. Clinton brings up Trump's foundation and the portrait of Trump is foundation bought. ""Who does that?"" she asks.9:58: Clinton now attacking Trump for ""mocking"" a disabled reporter and going after Judge Curiel. She slams Trump's ""dark"" and ""dangerous"" vision. Clinton talks about Trump applauding those who are punching people at his rallies. Trump says it is so sad that Clinton is talking about violence at his rallies when Clinton caused it. Good retort from Trump.9:54: Clinton slams Trump for saying that he could not have possibly groped the women because they were not attractive enough. Trump claims he did not say that. Clinton says Trump said at a rally, ""look at her. I don't think so."" She says Trump thinks ""belittling women makes him bigger."" He accuses Trump of going after the self-worth of women and it's up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and what we should expect from our next president. Trump says nobody has more respect for women than he does. He says Clinton is mentioning stuff that is ""all fiction"" but what isn't fictionalized are her emails that Clinton destroyed. Trump says Clinton has lied hundreds of times to the Congress and the people while a four-star general is going to jail for one lie.9:52: The debate turns to the candidates's fitness to be president. Wallace asks Trump about the sexual assault allegations against Trump. He wonders why so many different women over so many different years all make up these stories in the last week? He asks Clinton about defending what Bill Clinton did, which was worse. Trump says none of the allegations are true and suspects the Clinton campaign of coordinating with the women. Trump says he didn't know any of these women and he says the women either want fame or have been coordinating with the Clinton campaign. He now pivots to talking about how Clinton/Obama allies were coordinating with agitators to incite violence. He then says he believes the Clinton campaign got the women to make the allegations against him.9:50: Clinton now talking about ""experience."" She says in the 1970s, she was taking on racial discrimination while Trump was being sued for racial discrimination. She says in the 1980s, Trump was borrowing $14 million from his father. In the 1990s, he was calling Miss Universe an ""eating machine."" Clinton says Trump was hosting a reality show while she was in the situation room last decade. Trump says he started with a $1 million loan and built a phenomenal country. Trump says if we ran the county like he has run his business, even Clinton would be proud of the country.9:49: Trump says the one thing Clinton has over him is experience and is ""bad experience."" He says Clinton ""talks"" but doesn't get anything done. He says Clinton ran the State Department and $6 billion went missing. ""If you become president, this country will be some mess. Believe me,"" Trump says.9:47: Clinton now spinning on TPP. She claims she was against it then and will be against it after the election. She now slams Trump for shipping jobs to Mexico and buying Chinese steel and aluminum. Clinton accuses Trump of shedding ""crocodile tears"" and says Trump's hotel in Vegas was built with Chinese steel.9:43: Wallace wonders if Clinton's plan is even more of the Obama stimulus plan, which has failed to stimulate the economy as promised. Clinton evades the question. Trump using his time to slam the Clintons for NAFTA and supporting the TPP. He says so many communities have suffered because of NAFTA.9:42: Clinton now accusing Trump of wanting ""massive tax cuts."" She says Obama inherited the worst economic condition since the Depression and he has cut the deficit by a third. Clinton now touting the investments in various people/industries in her economic plan.9:39: Trump says Clinton's plan will double the taxes of Americans and it will be a ""disaster."" Trump now taking the discussion back to foreign policy. He wonders why we are protecting Saudi Arabia even though they are not paying the United States. Trump says we have to tell Japan, Germany, South Korea in a nice way to pay their fair share. Now going back to the economy, Trump says he will renegotiate trade deals because jobs are being ""sucked out of the economy."" But he says we will have ""more free trade"" under his plan. He says he will renegotiate NAFTA. He says if he cannot, then he will terminate NAFTA and make new deals. Trump says he will slash corporate taxes and repatriate wealth.9:37: The topic is now the economy.  Clinton says when the ""middle class thrives, America thrives."" She talks about clean energy programs and says she wants to do more to help small business while raising the national minimum wage and getting ""equal pay"" for women. She wants more technical education in high schools and community college. She also wants college to be debt-free for most Americans.9:36: And that's it for the ""immigration"" discussion. Good grief.9:35: Trump says Clinton has been proven to be a liar on so many things and her statements on Russia is yet another example.9:34: Huge opportunity for Trump to talk about illegal immigrant crime, the impact of illegal immigration on wages, etc. Instead, he gets sidetracked on Russia and wastes his chance to really put Clinton on the defensive. American public loses once again as it does not get a discussion on immigration policy even when it is actually one of the pre-selected topics in a debate.9:33: When Wallace asks Trump if he condemns Russia, Trump says he condemns ""Russia and anyone else."" He says Putin is not his best friend but it wouldn't be a bad thing if Russia and the United States got along. Trump says Clinton has been ""outplayed"" by Clinton.9:30: Trump: ""She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria."" Trump says Clinton/Obama have no idea where the refugees are coming from and adds that we will combat radical Islamic terrorism and slams Clinton/Obama for refusing to say ""radical Islam."" Trump says Putin doesn't respect Clinton. When Clinton says Russia is engaging in espionage, Trump says Clinton has no idea who is doing the hacking and says Clinton is upset that Putin has ""outsmarted"" Clinton in Syria and everywhere else.9:28: Wallace with an excellent follow-up about Clinton's dream about open borders in her emails. (Trump thanks Wallace for saying what Trump should have brought up). Spinning again, Clinton now claims she was talking about energy. [No bogus Abe Lincoln reference this time?] She now pivots to Russia and wonders if Trump will condemn Russia for hacking her campaign manager's emails. Trump says ""that was a great pivot"" from the fact that she wants open borders.9:26: Clinton accuses Trump of using illegal immigrants to build Trump Tower. She says she wants to get illegal immigrants out of the shadows so employers like Trump can't exploit them. Trump says we have millions who did it the right way and giving amnesty is unfair to those who did it the right way. He says under Clinton's plan, we'll have open borders. He says Clinton's trade policy will be a ""disaster.""9:25: Trump slams Bill Clinton for signing NAFTA. He says Clinton wanted the wall in 2006 but, since Clinton never gets anything done, the wall never got built.9:23: Clinton now pulling out the DREAMer card. She says she doesn't want to ""rip families apart"" and sending parents away from their children. She says she doesn't want to see Trump's ""deportation force"" in action. She accuses Trump of ""choking"" when he went to Mexico re: the border wall. Clinton says she will be introducing a plan for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in her first 100 days in office.9:21: Trump says Clinton wants to give amnesty, which is ""unfair"" and will be a ""disaster."" Trump says he has four mothers whose children have been killed by illegal immigrants in the audience. Trump says ""we have no country if we have no border"" and points out that Clinton wants ""open borders."" Trump says ICE and Border Patrol agents have endorsed him because they want ""strong borders."" Trump says that in New Hampshire, the biggest complaint voters had was about the heroin that pours across the Southern border that poisons the youth. Trump says right now with our open borders, ""we're getting the drugs and they're getting the cash."" Trump says we must stop the drugs and shore up the border and that includes building the wall. Trump says we have some ""bad hombres"" here and we need to get 'em out.9:20: THE DEBATE ACTUALLY TURNS TO IMMIGRATION.9:17: Wallace wonders how far Clinton is willing to go on abortion. He points out that Clinton has said that a fetus does not have Constitutional rights. Trump says you can rip the baby out of the womb of the mother in the 9th month of pregnancy if Clinton has her way. ""That's not acceptable,"" Trump says. Clinton accuses Trump of using ""scare rhetoric."" Clinton says ""this is one of the worst possible choices"" any woman has to make and government should not have to make it for these women.9:15: Wallace now asks the candidates about abortion. He asks Trump whether he wants the Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Trump says if that were to happen, ""I would think that it would go back to the individual states."" When pressed, Trump says Roe v. Wade will be overturned if he puts pro-life Justices on the Court. Clinton says she ""strongly supports"" Roe v. Wade. Clinton says so many states are putting ""stringent regulations"" on women from having abortions. She now defends Planned Parenthood and blasts states from defunding Planned Parenthood, which uses taxpayer dollars to fund abortion services. Clinton vows to defend Planned Parenthood, Roe v. Wade, and abortions.9:12: Wallace asks Trump if Clinton has convinced him that she supports the Second Amendment. Trump says Clinton was ""very angry"" when the Heller decision was upheld. Trump says people who believe in the Second Amendment were upset with what Clinton and to say. Clinton admits that she was indeed upset at the Heller decision and now brings in ""toddlers"" into the gun control debate, saying she was upset because toddlers hurting themselves with guns.9:11: Clinton claims she is for the Second Amendment before pushing for more gun control. She wants the ""gun show loophole"" closed and more background checks.9:08: Trump says it is so imperative that we have the right Justices on the Supreme Court. Trump slams Ginsberg for her ""ill-advised"" criticism. Trump says the Second Amendment is under ""absolute siege"" and if Clinton wins, we will have a Second Amendment that is a ""small replica"" of what we have now. Trump says the Justices he will appoint will be pro-life, protect the Second Amendment, and will have a conservative bent. He says they will interpret the Constitution the way the Founders wanted it.The Palins have arrived at the #debate. #Debatenight pic.twitter.com/TmbPNddXKg-- Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) October 20, 20169:06: Clinton says the Supreme Court raises the central question in this election about what kind of rights Americans will have. She says she feels strongly that the Supreme Court should stand on the side of the American people and not the wealthy. Sounding robotic, she says she wants a Supreme Court that stands up for women's rights and LGBT rights and against Citizens United. She says she has ""major disagreements"" with Trump on the Supreme Court. She says it is important that we not reverse ""marriage equality"" and Roe v. Wade. Clinton says the Supreme Court should ""represent all of us"" and the kinds of people she would nominate would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful.9:05: First topic will be the Supreme Court. Wallace asks the candidates where they want to see the Court take the country and their views on how the Constitution should be interpreted.9:03: Chris Wallace introduces Trump and Clinton.

For the first time, Trump and Clinton will not have to compete with NFL football. And all of the negative publicity that has surrounded Trump the last few weeks may get viewers to tune in to see how Trump will react. That will present Trump with a golden opportunity to finally make the case for his candidacy to millions of potentially undecided voters. The only question is whether Trump can be as disciplined as Jerry Tarkanian's UNLV teams were on defense or whether he'll be the same Trump that seemed to wing the first two debates and saw his poll numbers plummet as a result.Clinton to predominantly Hispanic crowd in North Las Vegas, Bill by her side: ""our family will support your family"" pic.twitter.com/g6c1C6PUv0

""I think a hard rule that DC has no business in this space sucks us into the controversy,"" he said.In May, Obama announced a new federal policy to pressure K-12 schools to make all their bathrooms dual-sex. The policy was cheered by the Democrats' gay activist groups, but was also opposed by the public, according to polls.In the November email, Podesta argued the campaign should criticize conservatives and the GOP, rather than openly support or oppose transgender bathrooms. ""I agree with Joel that we are better off just attacking the other side,"" he wrote, likely referring to Joel Benenson, the campaign's chief strategist and pollster.In September of this year, Clinton told voters that North Carolina's bathroom privacy and safety bill was ""bad for business"" and an example of Republicans trying to overreach.

They, along with the Obama administration, have created all of the poverty they proclaim they want to fight,"" Peter Navarro, an economic policy advisor to Donald Trump, tells Breitbart News.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNavarro was responding to Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine's (D-VA) ""social justice war on poverty"" speech delivered in Detroit on Tuesday.""That poverty has now crept up to the middle class and down to the Black and Latino communities in our battered inner cities,"" the best-selling author with a Phd. in economics from Harvard says.But Navarro, a professor of economics at the University of California at Irvine, tells Breitbart News, ""The Democrats have been fighting a losing war on poverty since the days of Lyndon Johnson and the only thing they have to show for it is a weak economy, a huge government debt, and despair in the constituencies that for some inexplicable reason keep putting them back into office.""In his speech, Kaine outlined what he called ""the three pillars"" of the Clinton-Kaine social justice war on poverty, all of which are heavy on government spending, and redistribution of wealth, which the Detroit Free Press reported include:(1) Raising incomes for families, which entails raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, investing in poverty-stricken communities with things like infrastructure improvement projects, and increasing tax credits for child care.(2) Making sure communities and homes are safe by fighting things like housing discrimination and predatory lending; ensuring the water and air in places like Flint are safe to consume; and enacting common sense gun control measures like universal background checks.
(3) And improving education by expanding early childhood development and Head Start programs.""This is just misplaced 1960s looking into the rear view mirror,"" Navarro notes.Kaine's proposals pushed the Clinton-Kaine campaign farther to the left on social justice-driven economic policies than Hillary Clinton at the top of the ticket has previously proposed in her own public statements.Oddly, the Clinton-Kaine campaign chose Kaine at the bottom of the ticket to set forth these new proposals on a day that Clinton herself was off the campaign trail and preparing for Wednesday night's third and final debate with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.""Everything about this is wrong,"" Navarro says of Kaine's assertion that the array of expanded Great Society style government spending programs would be a ""defining mission"" of a Clinton-Kaine administration.""I would think the defining mission of the Clinton Kaine campaign would be to double the GDP growth rate, to create tens of millions of new jobs and trillions of dollars of new income for all the people of America. That's exactly what the Trump plan does,"" he adds.""It's curious that Kaine has no understanding that the Clinton-Kaine plan to raise taxes, increase regulations,  put thousands of coal miners under the poverty line, and continue to ship thousands of manufacturing jobs overseas would increase poverty,"" Navarro says.Navarro says that ""As far as a defining mission, national secruity/the war on terror and economic growth are the twin pillars of the responsibilities of any nation.""""That should be the mission of the Clinton-Kaine campaign. It is the mission of the Trump campaign,"" he adds.One of the myriad government-focused policy proposals advanced by Kaine in his Tuesday speech is illustrative of how he has pushed the Clinton-Kaine agenda further to the left, with Hillary Clinton's apparent agreement.On the issue of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which Kaine says the Clinton-Kaine team now supports and will champion, in April Politifact ruled in it's ""Truth-O-Meter"" that when ""Sanders said, ""When this campaign began, I said that we've got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12,"" that ""We rate his claim Mostly True.""Later that month, when asked by CNN's Wolf Blizter, moderating a Democratic presidential candidate debate,""If a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?"" Clinton said ""Well, of course I would.""Kaine's speech now moves the Clinton-Kaine campaign from a position of passive acceptance of a progressive/labor union goal of a $15 an hour minimum wage to active leadership in achieving that goal as part of its ""defining mission.""Kaine also moved the Clinton campaign to the left on health care, where the public by almost a two to one margin has declared Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, to be a failure.One day before the White House signaled its support for a public option on Wednesday, an even more intrusive invasion of government into the delivery of health care than the Affordable Care Act, Kaine said in his Detroit speech, ""We've got to create a public option for health care so that we can continue to drive down health care prices.""Previously, Politifact reported that Clinton's position on a public option was more passive, citing her campaign website, which stated her health care plan to be:Defend and expand the Affordable Care Act, which covers 20 million people. Hillary will stand up to Republican-led attacks on this landmark law--and build on its success to bring the promise of affordable health care to more people and make a ""public option"" possible. She will also support letting people over 55 years old buy into Medicare.Clinton previously wanted to ""make a 'public option' possible."" After Kaine's speech, the Clinton-Kaine position is now ""to create a public option for health care.""You can watch Kaine's entire 53 minute speech here. 
Fighting poverty is a growth strategy. It's a competitive strategy, but it's also a moral responsibility and it's going to be a defining mission of a Clinton-Kaine administration.
(1) Raising incomes for families, which entails raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, investing in poverty-stricken communities with things like infrastructure improvement projects, and increasing tax credits for child care.
(2) Making sure communities and homes are safe by fighting things like housing discrimination and predatory lending; ensuring the water and air in places like Flint are safe to consume; and enacting common sense gun control measures like universal background checks.
(3) And improving education by expanding early childhood development and Head Start programs.Defend and expand the Affordable Care Act, which covers 20 million people. Hillary will stand up to Republican-led attacks on this landmark law--and build on its success to bring the promise of affordable health care to more people and make a ""public option"" possible.

This plan, Sirota notes, would ""enrich"" the Wall Street hedge fund and private equity industries ""that have donated millions to support Clinton's presidential bid.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom IBT:While Hillary Clinton has spent the presidential campaign saying as little as possible about her ties to Wall Street, the executive who some observers say could be her Treasury Secretary has been openly promoting a plan to give financial firms control of hundreds of billions of dollars in retirement savings. The executive is Tony James, president of the Blackstone Group.The investment colossus is most famous in politics for its Republican CEO likening an Obama tax plan to a Nazi invasion. James, though, is a longtime Democrat -- and one of Clinton's top fundraisers. The billionaire sculpted the retirement initiative with a prominent labor economist whose work is supported by another investment mogul who is a  big Clinton donor. The proposal has received bipartisan praise from prominent economic thinkers, and James says that Clinton's top aides are warming to the idea.It is a plan that proponents say could help millions of Americans -- but could also enrich another constituency: the hedge fund and private equity industries that Blackstone dominates and that have donated millions to support Clinton's presidential bid.The proposal would require workers and employers to put a percentage of payroll into individual retirement accounts ""to be invested well in pooled plans run by professional investment managers,"" as James put it. In other words, individual voluntary 401(k)s would be replaced by a single national system, and much of the mandated savings would flow to Wall Street, where companies like Blackstone could earn big fees off the assets. And because of a gap in federal anti-corruption rules, there would be little to prevent the biggest investment contracts from being awarded to the biggest presidential campaign donors.Read the rest here.

To me it made sense,"" Condie said.While some members of the CRA wonder if the public is ready for transgender employees handling and serving food, Mendelsohn insists it does not matter what customers say.""You know, you always hear the thing, 'The customer's always right,'"" Mendelsohn retorted. ""In my restaurants, the customer's always right unless they attack you personally.""Those friendly to the transgender community estimate that as many as 1.4 million Americans claim to be transgender. That could be about .6 percent of the population. Other estimates maintain there are only around 700,000 transgender Americans, or .3 percent of the populace.According to a recent Washington Post article, transgenders may suffer an unemployment rate twice that of the general population.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"	['Warner']	['creation']

""I don't really believe in coincidence.""Cohen said the rapid flurry of accusations leveled at Trump, all at the same time, makes him very suspicious.Former Apprentice contestant from the show's fifth season Summer Zervos came forward last week as a client of Hillary Clinton supporter Gloria Allred and claimed that Trump has forced himself upon her in a sexual manner.""All of a sudden these four or five people come forward with things that all happened at different periods of time-that they said happened--happened years and years ago? It is just very unusual to me,"" he said.""While we were on the show, we had contact with Mr. Trump, but there was always people around,"" he said.""We were shooting almost every day,"" he said. ""While you are on the show you have very limited contact with Mr. Trump, not with other people. No one is ever alone with Mr. Trump, while the shooting is occurring, in terms of contestants.""""In my season, I was the leader on the first task and the reward was having dinner with Mr. Trump at his apartment in Trump Tower-I was actually on the women's team on my season, I was the only man on the women's team-we all went up for dinner with Mr. Trump, he was a gentleman, everything that took place was on the up-and-up, and he talked about his wife consistently and she actually had dinner with us-we had a nice conversation.""After shooting, Mr. Trump left the set, Cohen said. ""Sometimes, Mr. Trump, well not really Mr. Trump, but somebody from the production staff would send a message to you, like: 'Hey, Mr. Trump thought you did great. Or: He's sorry he fired you. Or, just something nice from Mr. Trump. Never anything negative.""""I've been in contact with Mr. Trump, since the show ended, and also in contact with at least one person from every season of the regular Apprentice,"" he said. ""There allegations were never raised-we've never even heard rumors of these allegations."" Trump's program had non-famous professionals competing in the first six seasons and the 10th; in other seasons, the contestants were celebrities.Cohen said that very atmosphere of the show's community meant that there were no secrets. He went on to say:I am a criminal defense attorney. I've represented victims of sexual abuse and defendants who were accused of some sort of sexual impropriety. I can tell you that in this instance, because, we've all had the same experience on the show-we share a lot of instances of what happened on the show, or after the show, there's stories that fly around-everyone talks to each other-there's emails back-and-forth and texts-and there was never a word or even a hit of impropriety that anyone ever stated and yes, someone on one of the seasons,would have said something to someone.Another fact to consider was that given the way people left the show, many of them would have been in an emotional state that opened them up to lashing out at Trump and not wanting to keep his secrets, if there were any, he said.""Getting fired on a national stage is never a happy moment,"" he said.""It was not a happy moment for me,"" Cohen said. Cohen was fired in the second week of the show's second season.The lawyer said given the animosity and bitterness surrounding some of the show's exits, he is certain accusations of sexual misconduct would have come out sooner. ""You know? Three weeks before a national election? As I said, there weren't even rumors, so it seems strange that this would be brought up now.""The Ponderosa was another opportunity for stories to surface, he said.When contestants were fired from the show, they moved to the group apartment at Trump Tower to private apartments at another Trump property in New York City, called The Ponderosa, where they were sequestered until the shooting of the season was completed, he said.""Until the show ends, we're all sequestered,"" he said.""People get fired and they would back to the Ponderosa and tell stories about how they got fired,"" Cohen said.With no contact with the outside world, the fired contestants talked about nothing else except the show, sharing stories and rumors, he said. ""It was all we had.""After he left the show and completed his publicity appearances for the program, Cohen said he would still have contact with the New York City developer, including a time when Trump still owned the Miss Universe beauty pageant and Cohen was at the pageant's home in Las Vegas.""I saw him interact there with individuals there-always a gentleman,"" he said. ""I am friends with women who competed in Miss Universe and they have nothing but great things to say about Mr. Trump.""I am a criminal defense attorney. I've represented victims of sexual abuse and defendants who were accused of some sort of sexual impropriety.

While Judge Sotomayor exemplifies the American Dream, she would not have even been on the short list if she were not Hispanic.""Shapiro noted that ""in over 10 years on the Second Circuit, she has not issued any important decisions or made a name for herself as a legal scholar or particularly respected jurist.""In picking a case to highlight during his introduction of the nominee, Shapiro wrote, ""President Obama had to go back to her days as a trial judge and a technical ruling that ended the 1994-95 baseball strike.""Critics of Sotomayor, however, were not confined to the Right but spanned the gamut all the way to the far Left.In a letter to President Barack Obama in 2009, his former Harvard law professor and mentor Laurence Tribe tried to convince the President not to appoint Sotomayor, saying that despite her ""demographic appeal"" she was not qualified for the job and would stir dissension among the justices.Although he acknowledged his intent to move the court in a ""pragmatically progressive direction,"" Tribe counseled the President to steer clear of Sotomayor.""If you were to appoint someone like Sonia Sotomayor,"" Tribe wrote, ""whose personal history and demographic appeal you don't need me to underscore, I am concerned that the impact within the court would be negative in these respects.""""Bluntly put, she's not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is, and her reputation for being something of a bully could well make her liberal impulses backfire and simply add to the fire power of the Roberts/Alito/Scalia/Thomas wing of the Court,"" he said.According to Slate, during Court arguments, Sotomayor often watched Scalia with ""a leery gaze,"" as though she were dreading the next statement to leave his mouth. When he spoke, ""Sotomayor remained frozen in a steely stare,"" the article states.Which probably explains why she would have liked to beat him with a baseball bat, had she had the chance.Follow Thomas D.

If you start whining before the game's even over, if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose, you start blaming somebody else, then you don't have what it takes to be in this job because there are a lot of times when things don't go our way or my way.However,  as a presidential candidate Obama expressed concerns about the validity of U.S. elections. On numerous occasions before being sworn in as commander-in-chief, Obama decried flaws in the American election system, which included voter ID laws, rhetoric from Bush administration Justice Department officials and the agency's traditional handling of voter fraud investigations. In 2008, shortly before the general election, Obama even had acknowledged that elections had been ""monkeyed"" with in the past.1) October 20, 2006 - Barack Obama in a joint press release with Rep. John Lewis and then-Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) accused the Georgia State Board of Elections of a ""cynical attempt"" to influence elections when a letter was inadvertently sent out telling voters to bring ""proper government-issued photo identification"" to the polls shortly after a Georgia Superior Court judge ruled the requirement violated the state constitution.Partial press statement:Today Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), and Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Barack Obama (D-IL) sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez requesting federal investigation of an action taken by the Georgia State Board of Elections. The elections board sent out over 200,000 letters informing voters in mainly Democratic districts that they may not have the proper government-issued photo identification required to vote in the November 7th election. That letter would have been appropriate had a Superior Court judge in Fulton County not ruled last month that the Georgia photo-ID law violated the state constitution.A prominent GOP member of the elections board contended the letters were slated for delivery before the judge's ruling, but evidence released from the secretary of state's office reveals the letters were sent to the post office after the judge issued his decision. Former Gov. Roy Barnes has filed a lawsuit against the state over the matter, and Rep. Lewis joined Senators Dodd and Obama requesting a federal investigation of the mailing to determine whether voting rights laws were broken....""This seems like nothing more than a cynical attempt to influence elections by discouraging people to vote,"" Sen. Obama said. ""It's crucial that we vigorously defend American citizens' right to vote, and this matter should be thoroughly investigated as soon as possible.""2) September 28, 2007 - Then-Sen. Barack Obama address gives remarks at the Howard University convocation in Washington, DC. In the speech to the audience at the HBCU, Obama vowed to scale back voter-fraud investigations in black and Latino districts and pursue investigations into voter suppression if elected president.Remarks:Like Katrina did with poverty, Jena exposed glaring inequities in our justice system that were around long before that schoolyard fight broke out. It reminds us of the fact that we have a system that locks away too many young, first-time, non-violent offenders for the better part of their lives - a decision that's made not by a judge in a courtroom, but by politicians in Washington. It reminds us that we have certain sentences that are based less on the kind of crime you commit than on what you look like and where you come from. It reminds us that we have a Justice Department whose idea of prosecuting civil rights violations is trying to rollback affirmative action programs at our college and universities; a Justice Department whose idea of prosecuting voting rights violations is to look for voting fraud in black and Latino communities where it doesn't exist.We know these inequities are there. We know they're wrong. And yet they go largely unnoticed until people find the courage to stand up and say they're wrong. Until someone finally says, ""It's wrong that Scooter Libby gets no jail time for compromising our national security, but a 21-year-old honor student is still sitting in a Georgia prison for something that wasn't even a felony. That's wrong.""From the day I take office as President, America will have a Justice Department that is truly dedicated to the work it began in the days after Little Rock. I will rid the department of ideologues and political cronies, and for the first time in eight years, the Civil Rights Division will actually be staffed with civil rights lawyers who prosecute civil rights violations, and employment discrimination, and hate crimes. And we'll have a Voting Rights Section that actually defends the right of every American to vote without deception or intimidation. When flyers are placed in our neighborhoods telling people to vote on the wrong day, that won't only be an injustice, it will be a crime.3) October 19, 2007 - Then-Sen. Obama called on a the head of the Bush Justice Department's voting rights division John Tanner to be fired for saying voter ID laws hurt the elderly but aren't a problem for minorities because they often die before old age.Obama called the remarks ""patently erroneous, offensive, and dangerous""given they had come from a federal official charged with protecting voting rights in America.Letter as follows:October 19, 2007The Honorable Peter D. Keisler
Acting Attorney General
Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20530-0001Dear Mr. Keisler:On October 5, 2007, at the National Latino Congreso in Los Angeles, John Tanner, the chief of the voting rights section of the Civil Rights Division, spoke on a panel regarding minority voters. During the course of that discussion, which focused on recent state laws requiring photo identification for voting, Mr. Tanner said that such photo ID requirements disadvantage the elderly ""[a]nd that's a shame."" He explained: ""You know, creating problems for elderly persons just is not good under any circumstance.""However, according to Mr. Tanner, such requirements do not disenfranchise minorities, and in fact, they actually benefit minorities. He said: ""Our society is such that minorities don't become elderly the way white people do; they die first. There are inequities in health care. There are a variety of inequities in this country. And so anything that disproportionately impacts the elderly has the opposite impact on minorities; just the math is such as that.""Such comments are patently erroneous, offensive, and dangerous, and they are especially troubling coming from the federal official charged with protecting voting rights in this country. Mr. Tanner has already demonstrated questionable judgment in overruling the decision of Justice Department lawyers that the Georgia photo ID requirement would disproportionately discriminate against African Americans. For Mr. Tanner to now suggest, in an effort to defend his erroneous decision, that photo identification are not necessary for minority voters because ""they die first"" shows just how far the Justice Department has fallen. This is a disgrace and yet another reason why the next Attorney General must demonstrate a strong commitment to civil rights.But, until the next Attorney General is confirmed, you are in charge of the Department, and you are in charge of ensuring that our laws are enforced and that the civil rights of all Americans are protected. Through his inexcusable comments, Mr. Tanner has clearly demonstrated that he possesses neither the character nor the judgment to be heading the Voting Rights Section. For that reason, I respectfully request that you remove him from his position.Sincerely, Barack ObamaUnited States Senator4) April 28, 2008 - Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama decried a Supreme Court decision that upheld Indiana's voter ID law. He called the state's voter ID law and other like it ""discriminatory barriers to the right to vote"" in a written statement on the heels of the ruling.Written statement as follows:""I will continue to fight to ensure that all of our citizens have equal and unfettered access to the polls, including Indiana voters on May 6. Although I believe today's decision is wrong, I am encouraged that the court has not completely closed the door to future challenges to state voter ID laws that create discriminatory barriers to the right to vote.""5)  September 4, 2008 - Then-Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama was asked about a ""rigged"" election at a rally at Ohio's Kent State University. Obama admitted throughout history both Democrats and Republicans had ""monkeyed"" with elections. As president, he vowed to have a ""non-partisan"" division of the Justice Department committed to voting rights.Remarks as follows:I tell you what, it helps in Ohio that we have Democrats in charge of the machines.But, look, I come from Chicago. So I want to be honest, it is not as if it is just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past. Sometimes Democrats have, too.Whenever people are in power, they have this tendency to try to, you know, tilt things in their direction. That is why we have got to have a, I believe, a voting rights division in the Justice Department that is non-partisan and that is serious about investigating cases of voter fraud, is serious about making sure the people are not being discouraged to voteThat is why the voting rights legislation that was passed a couple years ago to help the county clerks to make sure that the machines are in place are important. That's why we need paper trails on these new electronic machines, so that you actually have something that you can hang on to after you punched that letter to make sure it has not been hacked into.Those are all part of the process of making sure that our democracy works for everybody. One of the great things about this election has been all the interest that has been taken in this election. When I spoke Thursday night, there were more viewers than watched the finals of ""American Idol."" Now that is big. That is big. That's big. And I hope a lot of people are watching the Republican convention. I want people to have information. And then I want to make sure that our democracy is working the way it should be. This is very near and dear to my heart because when I was a lawyer, I practiced voting rights law. I filed a lot of lawsuits. In Illinois, I helped to make sure that you could go ahead and get at drivers' license facilities at the DMV. So I've been working on this for a long time. I think the more people participate, the more they are paying attention. Ultimately, the better off everybody is. OK? Hold on one second. It's the guys' turn.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorThe notion that somehow if Mr. Trump loses Florida, it's because of those people that you have to watch out for, that is both irresponsible and, by the way, doesn't really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you want out of a president. If you start whining before the game's even over, if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose, you start blaming somebody else, then you don't have what it takes to be in this job because there are a lot of times when things don't go our way or my way.Today Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), and Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Barack Obama (D-IL) sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez requesting federal investigation of an action taken by the Georgia State Board of Elections. The elections board sent out over 200,000 letters informing voters in mainly Democratic districts that they may not have the proper government-issued photo identification required to vote in the November 7th election. That letter would have been appropriate had a Superior Court judge in Fulton County not ruled last month that the Georgia photo-ID law violated the state constitution.
A prominent GOP member of the elections board contended the letters were slated for delivery before the judge's ruling, but evidence released from the secretary of state's office reveals the letters were sent to the post office after the judge issued his decision. Former Gov. Roy Barnes has filed a lawsuit against the state over the matter, and Rep. Lewis joined Senators Dodd and Obama requesting a federal investigation of the mailing to determine whether voting rights laws were broken.

var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);""This seems like nothing more than a cynical attempt to influence elections by discouraging people to vote,"" Sen. Obama said. ""It's crucial that we vigorously defend American citizens' right to vote, and this matter should be thoroughly investigated as soon as possible.""Like Katrina did with poverty, Jena exposed glaring inequities in our justice system that were around long before that schoolyard fight broke out. It reminds us of the fact that we have a system that locks away too many young, first-time, non-violent offenders for the better part of their lives - a decision that's made not by a judge in a courtroom, but by politicians in Washington. It reminds us that we have certain sentences that are based less on the kind of crime you commit than on what you look like and where you come from. It reminds us that we have a Justice Department whose idea of prosecuting civil rights violations is trying to rollback affirmative action programs at our college and universities; a Justice Department whose idea of prosecuting voting rights violations is to look for voting fraud in black and Latino communities where it doesn't exist.
We know these inequities are there. We know they're wrong. And yet they go largely unnoticed until people find the courage to stand up and say they're wrong. Until someone finally says, ""It's wrong that Scooter Libby gets no jail time for compromising our national security, but a 21-year-old honor student is still sitting in a Georgia prison for something that wasn't even a felony. That's wrong.""

From the day I take office as President, America will have a Justice Department that is truly dedicated to the work it began in the days after Little Rock. I will rid the department of ideologues and political cronies, and for the first time in eight years, the Civil Rights Division will actually be staffed with civil rights lawyers who prosecute civil rights violations, and employment discrimination, and hate crimes. And we'll have a Voting Rights Section that actually defends the right of every American to vote without deception or intimidation. When flyers are placed in our neighborhoods telling people to vote on the wrong day, that won't only be an injustice, it will be a crime.October 19, 2007
The Honorable Peter D. Keisler
Acting Attorney General
Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20530-0001
Dear Mr. Keisler:
On October 5, 2007, at the National Latino Congreso in Los Angeles, John Tanner, the chief of the voting rights section of the Civil Rights Division, spoke on a panel regarding minority voters. During the course of that discussion, which focused on recent state laws requiring photo identification for voting, Mr. Tanner said that such photo ID requirements disadvantage the elderly ""[a]nd that's a shame."" He explained: ""You know, creating problems for elderly persons just is not good under any circumstance.""
However, according to Mr. Tanner, such requirements do not disenfranchise minorities, and in fact, they actually benefit minorities. He said: ""Our society is such that minorities don't become elderly the way white people do; they die first. There are inequities in health care. There are a variety of inequities in this country. And so anything that disproportionately impacts the elderly has the opposite impact on minorities; just the math is such as that.""
Such comments are patently erroneous, offensive, and dangerous, and they are especially troubling coming from the federal official charged with protecting voting rights in this country. Mr. Tanner has already demonstrated questionable judgment in overruling the decision of Justice Department lawyers that the Georgia photo ID requirement would disproportionately discriminate against African Americans. For Mr. Tanner to now suggest, in an effort to defend his erroneous decision, that photo identification are not necessary for minority voters because ""they die first"" shows just how far the Justice Department has fallen. This is a disgrace and yet another reason why the next Attorney General must demonstrate a strong commitment to civil rights.
But, until the next Attorney General is confirmed, you are in charge of the Department, and you are in charge of ensuring that our laws are enforced and that the civil rights of all Americans are protected. Through his inexcusable comments, Mr. Tanner has clearly demonstrated that he possesses neither the character nor the judgment to be heading the Voting Rights Section. For that reason, I respectfully request that you remove him from his position.
Sincerely,
 
Barack Obama
United States SenatorI tell you what, it helps in Ohio that we have Democrats in charge of the machines.
But, look, I come from Chicago. So I want to be honest, it is not as if it is just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past. Sometimes Democrats have, too.
Whenever people are in power, they have this tendency to try to, you know, tilt things in their direction. That is why we have got to have a, I believe, a voting rights division in the Justice Department that is non-partisan and that is serious about investigating cases of voter fraud, is serious about making sure the people are not being discouraged to vote
That is why the voting rights legislation that was passed a couple years ago to help the county clerks to make sure that the machines are in place are important. That's why we need paper trails on these new electronic machines, so that you actually have something that you can hang on to after you punched that letter to make sure it has not been hacked into.
Those are all part of the process of making sure that our democracy works for everybody. One of the great things about this election has been all the interest that has been taken in this election. When I spoke Thursday night, there were more viewers than watched the finals of ""American Idol."" Now that is big. That is big. That's big. And I hope a lot of people are watching the Republican convention. I want people to have information. And then I want to make sure that our democracy is working the way it should be. This is very near and dear to my heart because when I was a lawyer, I practiced voting rights law. I filed a lot of lawsuits. In Illinois, I helped to make sure that you could go ahead and get at drivers' license facilities at the DMV. So I've been working on this for a long time. I think the more people participate, the more they are paying attention. Ultimately, the better off everybody is. OK? Hold on one second. It's the guys' turn.SIGN UP"	['Lewis', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

But Blue Cross Blue Shield will only offer its ""catastrophic"" plan to those looking for insurance in Pima County.Arizona is not the only state where its insurers are raising their rates on the exchanges.Insurers on Michigan's exchange are seeing double-digit increases in their premiums, while in Minnesota, state regulators allowed rate increases from 50-67 percent.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

He has also helped numerous companies and mentored many of Silicon Valley's top entrepreneurs. As part of the small circle of Silicon Valley tech royalty, his net worth is $2.7 billion, which puts him at number 246 on the Forbes 400 list of the world's richest individuals.He then used his wealth to sponsor philanthropic activities through a nonprofit he created called the Thiel Foundation, which organizes and sponsors nonprofits that are working on radical new ideas in technology, government, and human affairs. Thiel has also been the main financial backer of the ""Machine Intelligence Research Institute,"" which is a world leader in pursuing technological singularity and artificial intelligence.As a Silicon Valley insider, it would be assumed that Thiel would be a typical progressive who supports unlimited open borders and the full left-wing agenda. But Breitbart News reported, Thiel -- who had written conservative criticisms of political correctness as a student -- became more publicly political after he was viciously outed by Nick Denton's Gawker in a 2007 article titled, ""Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.""Milo Yiannopoulos, Breitbart's tech editor, described Gawker's political slant under Denton as ""doubling down on the hateful feminist and race-baiting claptrap so loathed by anyone outside of Manhattan and American colleges, giving indications that its poisonous, lunatic feminist organ Jezebel will be the primary lens through which Gawker interprets popular culture.""Thiel seemed to respond to the pain of his Gawker experience by becoming an open supporter of Ron Paul. Since 2007, Thiel has funded GOP outreach efforts to the gay community and been a solid contributor to Republican presidential campaigns.Thiel also spent $10 million to fund litigation against Gawker victims, including the iconic professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, who was the subject of surreptitious filming and the Gawker release of a private sex tape. ""The Hulk"" in March won $115 million in compensatory damages and $25 million more for punitive damages against Gawker for violating his privacy rights. The since-bankrupt Gawker is in the process of being liquidated.All of this is anathema to supposed free speech progressives. But in the ultimate sin to the ""Left,"" Thiel served as a Trump California primary delegate and became one of the few large donors to the Trump presidential campaign, which has set records by raising $360 million mostly from small donors of under $140.Led by the infamous Ellen Pao, who lost a 2015 gender discrimination and retaliation suit against the prestigious Silicon Valley venture capital firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers, the Left moved to retaliate against Theil by starting an Internet campaign to have Thiel fired from his positions as a board member of Facebook and a venture capital partner of Y Combinator.Pao, through her organization ""Project,"" also called on consumers, job candidates, partners and other fellow progressive travelers to retaliate against Thiel's friends and business associates by ending relationships with any organization that associates with him.The anti-Thiel witch hunt is patterned on the 2014 chaos generated when Mozilla co-founder and then-CEO Brendan Eich gave a $1,000 donation to Proposition 8, California's successful anti-gay marriage ballot initiative. Leftist viral attacks quickly forced him to step down; since then, the Mozilla Firefox desktop browser's market share has tanked from 13 percent to 8 percent.Facebook and Y Combinator's CEOs are both staunch Hillary Clinton supporters, but they know Thiel is one of the most brilliant strategists in Silicon Valley and his loss would cause real turmoil in their organizations.SIGN UP"	['Paul', 'Forbes', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	['gay']
