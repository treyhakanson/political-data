Aliyev's son, Ilham, is the current president of Azerbaijan.Read more here.SIGN UP

""We'll decide what to do, what our next steps will be, vis a vis this organization.""UNESCO, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, is regarded by many Israelis as hostile. Arab members of UNESCO and their supporters frequently condemn Israel.At the Paris meeting, Israeli ambassador Carmel Shama Hacohen dropped a copy of the resolution into a trash bin.""This is history denial and history will render this embarrassing decision as meaningless as previous ones,"" Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement.Two weeks ago, Israel lashed out at UNESCO for renewing a similar resolution that condemned it for restricting Muslim access to the site, in a part of Jerusalem captured by Israeli forces in a 1967 war.Israel considers all of Jerusalem as its capital, a position that is not recognized internationally. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state they seek in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a statement that the aim of the UNESCO resolutions was to protect the religious rights of all three major monotheistic religions, Christianity, Judaism and Islam, at Jerusalem's holy sites.SIGN UP"

She needed assistance to get onto it as she could be seen reaching her hand out for a boost or some added steadiness. An aide extended his hand and Clinton held on tightly as she made her way up the 18 inches.

In the past, Hillary's health has been called into question by not only people on the Right, but even by her own staff.Breitbart News' Patrick Howley reported Tuesday that according to an email released by WikiLeaks, Huma Abedin even questioned Hillary's health in 2015, following a bad fall and subsequent concussion in 2012.  ""Top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin said in 2015, after the campaign began, that Clinton is 'still not perfect in her head.'""Leading up to September 11, 2016, people such as Mike Ceriovitch had been questioning Clinton's health on twitter using the hashtag #sickhillary. The questions began to rise following videos of her [Hillary Clinton] needing help getting upstairs, have coughing fits during speeches, and of a mysterious handler that is constantly with her. However, before September 11, these questions were written off as a conspiracy theory.Following her collapse at the 9/11 memorial this year, Clinton was forced to address her health issues. It is well known that Clinton has had her fair share of them.

During an interview with Kellyanne Conway on Tuesday, CNN's Wolf Blitzer breathlessly asked Trump's campaign manager to ask Trump to stop calling out the press at his rallies because he is scared ""there could be an ugly incident"" between Trump supporters and the ""hardworking young journalists"" who cover his rallies.A quick review of media stories over the last two weeks reveals more than a dozen articles in major publications with the same ""journalists victimized by Trump supporters at rallies"" narrative. Trump supporters endure long waits, messy parking, and often obstructed view seating to rally for their candidate. The press, on the other hand, is given their own entrance, sectioned off seating, and protection from event security and the Secret Service.After an exhaustive search, this Breitbart reporter could find exactly zero incidences of members of the media being physically attacked or assaulted at Trump rallies. None of this has stopped the misleading characterization of Trump supporters creating a ""menacing"" and ""dangerous"" environment for these special snowflakes.The narrative sprung up briefly in August when NBC's Katy Tur wrote a long piece in Marie Claire in which she gives her account of her confrontational relationship with Trump and the backlash his ""insults"" on her reporting created with his supporters. Here is a small piece from her ""no-holds-barred"" account:I was six months into covering the Trump campaign for MSNBC and NBC News, and there I was, in the belly of a World War II battleship, in a press pen made out of bicycle racks, surrounded by thousands of whipped-up Trump supporters....Trump decided to go further in Mount Pleasant, pointing his finger squarely at me and launching a personal attack as millions of Americans watched at home.""What a lie it was,"" Trump said, referring to the claim that he had left the stage abruptly. ""What a lie. Katy Tur. What a lie it was. Third. Rate. Reporter. Remember that."" The crowd's boos ricocheted off the iron hull of the USS Yorktown.Just a few days after the Tur piece was published, two other NBC press employees -- Frank Thorp and Ali Vitali -- tweeted out pictures and videos of Trump supporters showing insufficient deference to the press. It was so very traumatic that it inspired several stories, including this one in Real Clear Politics.Trump supporter swings by the press pen in Kissimmee, FL to let us know we're number one!! pic.twitter.com/WzUPBal7nW-- Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) August 12, 2016A slice of what it's like in the pen post Trump rally.

The same day Politico's Ben Schreckinger ran an article titled, ""Trump crowds rain hate on the press"" and CNN's Jim Acosta claimed to have found a crudely written sign with a swastika and ""media"" written on it.The next day, on October 14th, the narrative of violent Trump supporters scaring the press was being pushed across the media. The Huffington Post's Ed Mazza wrote a piece titled, ""Frenzied Donald Trump Supporters Are Turning On The Media -- And It's Getting Scary."" The Washington Post's Paul Farhi wrote, ""The press always got booed at Trump rallies. But now the aggression is menacing."" Ed Kilgore at New York Magazine titled his piece, ""Trump's Dangerous Game of 'Beat the Press'."" Tierney Mcafee's article in People Magazine was titled, ""Press Corps with Trump Now Needs Police Escort as Crowd Shouts 'Whores!'."" Even the Wall St. Journal got in on the action when Reid Epstein wrote, ""Trump Rally-Goers Dismiss His Vulgarities, Offer Their Own for Clinton, News Media."" Just to name a few.The stories have continued until the time of this writing with similar articles in the New York Times, Media Matters, Washington Post (again), AlterNet, and on and on.Every special snowflake reporter with a Twitter account wanted in on the sweet victimhood action.McKay Coppins from Buzzfeed tweeted a seven-second video of someone ""heckling reporters.""This guy is standing behind the press pen at the Trump rally heckling reporters as they try to work.

Just a week ago, Clinton was up 7 points (49-42 percent).Aided by an increase in support from independents and a greater ""strength of support"" from his backers, Trump is closing in on his Democratic opponent. Independents back Trump over Clinton 41-28 percent - a 13-point difference up from just 7 points last week and a tie between the candidates two weeks ago at 35 percent. As for level of support, 68 percent of those favoring Trump support him ""strongly."" This compared to just 61 percent for Clinton.As far as other takeaways from the poll, twice as many voters surveyed, 64-26 percent, expect Clinton to win compared to those who think Trump will win. Eighty-six percent of Democrats were found to think Clinton will win, while only 49 percent of Republicans expect Trump will win.The poll was conducted October 22-25, 2016 and is based on landline and cellphone interviews of 1,309 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and includes results among 1,221 likely voters.

But newly released FBI notes strongly suggest they still exist in several locations -- and they could be recovered, if only someone would impanel a grand jury and seize them.The emails were created during Clinton's use of a home-built and largely unprotected email system for her personal and government emails, and also for her management of the scandal-wracked, foreign-funded foundation while she was working as Secretary of State. Clinton insists she's handed over all of the government emails -- which actually belong to the taxpayer -- and insists she didn't break the law by mixing personal and government business or by storing and swapping classified information on her own email network. The hidden 33,000 emails are just emails about her personal life, she says. Top Democrats have quietly slammed Clinton for her recklessness and ethical short-cuts, but the FBI leadership decided that she should not be charged with crimes in the run-up to the 2016 election. Since that decision was announced, there's been growing evidence that the FBI and the Department of Justice handcuffed the FBI investigators and granted favorable treatment to Clinton's staff. Now Sperry shows how Justice Department and FBI officials have also declined multiple opportunities to find copies of the missing 33,000 emails that would provide more evidence about whether Clinton was obeying or violating many federal laws:In a May interview with FBI agents, an executive with the Denver contractor that maintained Clinton's private server revealed that an underling didn't bleach-clean all her subpoenaed emails, just ones he stored in a data file he used to transfer the emails from the server to Clinton's aides, who in turn sorted them for delivery to Congress.The Platte River Networks executive, whose name was redacted from the interview report, said PRN tech Paul Combetta ""created a 'vehicle' to transfer email files from the live mailboxes of [Clinton Executive Services Corp.] email accounts [and] then later used BleachBit software to shred the 'vehicle,' but the email content still existed in the live email accounts.""Unless one of Clinton's aides had the capability to log in to the PRN server as an administrator and remove a mailbox, her archived mailboxes more than likely still reside somewhere in that system. And they may also materialize on an internal ""shared drive"" that PRN created to control access to the Clinton email accounts among PRN employees. PRN has been under FBI order to preserve all emails and other evidence since the start of its investigation last year.Clinton's missing ""personal"" emails may also be captured on a Google server. According to FBI notes, Combetta ""transferred all of the Clinton email content to a personal Google email address he created.""

The Fund was launched in 2011 to support civil society in their efforts to advance human rights and uphold dignity for all.Dr. Michelle Cretella, president of the American College of Pediatricians, writes about this rare medical condition, known as a disorder of sex development:Human sexuality is binary by design with the purpose being the reproduction of our species. This principle is self-evident. Barring one of the rare disorders of sex development (DSD), no infant is ""assigned"" a sex or a gender at birth; rather birth sex declares itself anatomically in utero and is clearly evident and acknowledged at birth.The exceedingly rare DSDs, including but not limited to androgen insensitivity syndrome and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the human binary sexual norm. Unlike individuals with a normal genotype and hormonal axis who identify as ""transgender,"" those with DSD have an innate biological condition. Sex assignment in individuals with DSDs is complex and dependent on a variety of genetic, hormonal, and physical factors. Nevertheless, the 2006 consensus statement of the Intersex Society of North America did not endorse DSD as a third sex.The American Psychological Association (APA) defines ""intersex"":A variety of conditions that lead to atypical development of physical sex characteristics are collectively referred to as intersex conditions. These conditions can involve abnormalities of the external genitals, internal reproductive organs, sex chromosomes or sex-related hormones.APA goes on to discuss the process that takes place when a baby is diagnosed with DSD:When a baby is born with ambiguous genitals, doctors perform examinations and laboratory tests to determine exactly what condition the baby has. Determining the type of intersex condition is important, because some intersex conditions that cause ambiguous genitals (for example, certain types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia) can be associated with medical problems that may require urgent medical or surgical treatment. Because we expect everyone to be identifiably male or female, the parents and family members of babies born with ambiguous genitals are usually eager to learn what condition the child has, so that sex assignment can occur without delay.However, intersex activists have joined with the radical LGBTQ agenda to condemn attempts to provide surgery to infants born with this rare disorder, categorizing such intervention as the imposition of a gender identity onto a child.Activist Morgan Carpenter of ""Visibly Intersex"" writes in a blog post on the Intersex Awareness Day website about the stated concerns:We hear that parents demand surgeries; that the choice is between surgery or the foster care system. We also hear that parents don't know their child is visibly different until they are told. We hear that children with DSDs are not intersex. That they don't identify as intersex. That intersex advocates don't represent the interests of intersex children....What really matters is that we are able to make connections with our peers, and that we can dismantle the systems that cause shame and stigma. We share much in common with LGBT communities; we are more likely to be same sex attracted or transgender than non-intersex people, but our distinct issues need specific attention. LGBTI has to work for all constituent populations. We also have much in common with people with disabilities, and with the children's rights movement.Nevertheless, APA notes, ""Most persons born with intersex conditions are happy with their assigned sex, just as most persons born without intersex conditions are.""The Intersex Society of North America says that ""about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births"" are intersex cases.The United States is a proud and founding member of the Equal Rights Coalition, a recently established Coalition of 31 governments that aims to ""strengthen cooperation to advance the human rights of, and support inclusive development for all persons regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and sex characteristics.""

""The jobs theft will end the day I start the presidency,"" he pledged, promising to prevent jobs from leaving the state for Mexico, China, and other countries.Trump also cited the recent spike on Obamacare premiums, promising to repeal and replace the law. He cited former President Bill Clinton, who called Obamacare the ""craziest thing in the world"" earlier this month. And he referred to several recent revelations in Wikileaks, describing Hillary Clinton as a criminal who should not have been allowed to run for president, prompting chants of ""Lock her up!"" and ""Drain the swamp!""Many people came to the rally with their families; small children perched on their parents' shoulders, thrilled by the spectacle of Trump's airplane landing on the airstrip and taxiing to a halt behind the stage.""I'm as much anti-Hillary as I am a Trump supporter,"" said Bill, a local insurance executive, as he held his daughter aloft. ""The Supreme Court is the most important thing to me,"" he added, predicting that Trump would ""squeak out a win"" in the Tar Heel state. ""I don't think you can rely on polls today.""Dana Minges, a mother of one from nearby New Bern, came to the rally with family and friends. ""We have to get out of the hole we're in,"" she told Breitbart News. ""We have to get back to the core of the American people -- we have to provide for the poor, but what about the people who go to jobs every day and work their asses off?""Trump also talked up his performance in North Carolina, telling the audience that early voting was going well in the state and elsewhere.He was interrupted by a protester at one point, and asked the heckler whether he had been paid $1,500 by the Hillary Clinton campaign -- a reference to an activist recently exposed by James O'Keefe's Project Veritas and Wikileaks.Joel B.

It's not pretty."" It then continues by pointing to statements Clinton made while opposite Donald Trump during the October 19 debate.Those statements include her claim that she was ""upset"" with the ruling in District of Columbia v Heller (2008) because it endangered toddlers. But The Oklahoman countered, showing that Heller was not targeting laws that protect children but laws which effectively bar law-abiding citizens from having handguns in their homes for self-defense. And as for the long guns that were allowed when handguns were not, the draconian law required rifles and shotguns to be kept ""unloaded, with a trigger lock in place or with the gun disassembled at all times -- essentially useless.""The Oklahoman quoted constitutional law attorney Curt Levy, who pointed out that the four dissenting justices in Heller ""didn't lean on the argument that the law was about saving kids."" Rather, out of approximately 800 words, those justices ""included only a brief reference to 'children under the age of 14,'""Again -- Heller was not about endangering toddlers but removing restrictions so law-abiding citizens could defend themselves. And The Oklahoman warns that, given the chance, Clinton will try to add a fifth justice to the four dissenting ones for the purposes of ""overruling Heller.""Clinton's statements are not lost on political spectators overseas. The Guardian reports that gun owners in America fear Clinton supports opening the door to city-by-city handgun bans again. And this would be accomplished by actions that begin at the Supreme Court and trickle down.Donald Trump is the key to avoiding this scenario. The Oklahoman made this clear, stressing Trump's pledge that he will choose justices who ""will not do damage to the Second Amendment.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

The email went on to say, ""She does not talk about what she is for -- and presents the whole issue of trust and integrity -- surely, Barak Obama and I won't be influenced by money as we make brave choices. It is all about trust, though she has less in the bank than the president.""As the email continued, Greenberg became critical of what he saw as Clinton's indifference to corruption. ""She [Hillary Clinton] seems indifferent to the systemic corruption that makes it impossible for government to act for the middle class or address big problems, like climate or health care. She may be immune to pay to play, but the systemic isn't. She's got to distinguish between self and country -- and needs to.""Greenberg closes the email with, ""I won't go on.

She has a strategy that will probably get her to a delegate majority, but not one that aligns with the forces that will demand change.

While it is true that the State Department sits on the multi-agency, inter-governmental panel that reviews deals like this one, Hillary Clinton herself did not participate in the review or direct the Department to take any position on the sale of Uranium One. This is consistent with past practice; historically, matters pertaining to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (C.F.I.U.S.) do not rise to the Secretary's level. Rather, it is the Assistant Secretary of State for Economic, Energy and Business Affairs who serves as the State Department's principal representative to C.F.I.U.S. The individual who held that post in 2010 was Jose Fernandez, and he has personally attested that then-Secretary Clinton never interfered with him, saying ""Mrs. Clinton never intervened with me on any C.F.I.U.S. matter.""The coordination between Fernandez, the Clinton campaign, and its chairman John Podesta is undeniable.Sure Fernandez, as Fallon wrote, ""personally attested"" that Clinton ""never interfered"" with his decision to sign off on the uranium deal. But he made that claim after professing his commitment to do everything in his power to ""support Secretary Clinton.""What's also undeniable is that while Clinton's State Department was one of eight agencies to review and sign off on the uranium deal -- then-Secretary of State Clinton herself was the only agency head whose family foundation received $145 million in donations from multiple people connected to the sale, as reported by the New York Times.Not to mention Bill Clinton, who received a $500,000 speaking fee for a speech in Moscow paid for by a Russian government-connected bank.""And, in one case, a Russian investment bank connected to the deals paid money to Bill Clinton personally, through a half-million-dollar speaker's fee,"" reports the New Yorker.To date, no one in the Clinton campaign has ever denied the fact the Clinton-brokered sale of 20% of U.S. uranium to the Russian government ended up benefitting people who donated millions to her family foundation.Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudsonThe essential fact is that Hillary Clinton was not involved in the State Department's review of the sale to the Russians.

On Wednesday, Trump wrapped up a five-stop Florida swing in Tallahassee. The Tampa stop was the last of three for Clinton.Things, however, appear to be trending slightly in Trump's way in the Florida. Earlier in the day, Bloomberg released a poll showing Trump having taken a lead by two points, which was still in the polls margin of error but different from the other statewide polls that show Clinton with the edge.Both candidates eye Hillsborough County, FL as key not just to winning Florida, but to winning the White House. Hillsborough County -- the home of Tampa -- has gone in the previous four presidential elections, so has the presidency, with it going for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.At her rally Wednesday, Clinton took a few shots at her opponent Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, arguing that if she could last three debates for a total of four-and-a-half hours, then she had the stamina it takes to be president.She also continued to warn against Trump's wait-and-see approach to accepting the results of the election come election night as she had in previous appearances.After encouraging rallygoers to early vote, she touted her support from Republicans in Florida and suggested that support was meant to be a show of a rejection of ""hate and division.""""I am proud to have support from Republicans and independents here across Florida and across America who agree with me that we should reject hate and division,"" Clinton said. ""We have seen Donald Trump insult nearly every person in America. And I just find that so intolerable because look at this diverse crowd. Look at Tampa. It's a cosmopolitan city. Florida is paving the way for what our country will look like and we need to be lifting each other up, listening to each other, respecting each other - not sowing seeds of hatred and bigotry.However, she also acknowledged the work she has cut out ahead of her to reunited country after a divisive election should she emerge victorious.""I think one of my biggest jobs after this election will be bringing our country together and I'm going to need your help,"" she continued. ""We're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just people at the top with new jobs and infrastructure. That rail system Bob that you want -- we are going to get it because it would help you so much. Think of the people we would put to work. Technology, innovation, research, advanced manufacturing. And yes, small business. I want to be the best small business president you could have to help people start and grow their businesses.""Although the crowd was not particularly boisterous, it did show some enthusiasm, like when Clinton made overtures on the topics climate change, a ""fairer"" economy that included hikes in the minimum wage and equal pay for women, and closing tax loopholes created for ""millionaires and billionaires.""Lone protester greets rallygoers as they depart""We're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multimillionaire ever pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a firefighter,"" she declared. ""And I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year. So when you go to the polls, vote to grow the economy. More jobs with rising incomes.

It's just that simple. Our Founding Fathers never imagined the rise of the career politician. They envisioned citizen legislators. Elected office was never meant to be a career, nor was it meant to be a vessel for the centralization and maintenance of federal power...Citizen legislators could work outside the political establishment to bring a fresh perspective to how burdensome government policies negatively affect people's everyday lives.They could apply their practical experience to solving our nation's toughest problems, and because they would only serve a short time, citizen legislators could approach solving problems with a sense of urgency instead of kicking the can down the road for the sake of political security.Support for term limits is bipartisan. Another Gallup survey showed that 75 percent of voters--Republicans and Democrats alike--back legislation limiting the time people can serve at the highest levels of government. Given the polarizing climate crippling Washington today, there is something to be said about an idea that overwhelmingly unites both parties ...Career politicians created this moment of crisis America faces today.

Politicians should go to Washington, do their best, and then come home to live under the laws they've passed. It's just that simple. Our Founding Fathers never imagined the rise of the career politician. They envisioned citizen legislators. Elected office was never meant to be a career, nor was it meant to be a vessel for the centralization and maintenance of federal power...
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);Citizen legislators could work outside the political establishment to bring a fresh perspective to how burdensome government policies negatively affect people's everyday lives.
They could apply their practical experience to solving our nation's toughest problems, and because they would only serve a short time, citizen legislators could approach solving problems with a sense of urgency instead of kicking the can down the road for the sake of political security.
Support for term limits is bipartisan. Another Gallup survey showed that 75 percent of voters--Republicans and Democrats alike--back legislation limiting the time people can serve at the highest levels of government. Given the polarizing climate crippling Washington today, there is something to be said about an idea that overwhelmingly unites both parties ...
Career politicians created this moment of crisis America faces today. They aren't the ones who are going to solve it.
Term limits will help break this vicious cycle of gridlock that is stopping Congress from getting things done. It's time to finally make sure Washington is more concerned about the next generation than the next election.SIGN UP"

""But people who haven't met me-the media has made me out to be anti-Semitic, homophobic, transphobic, racist, xenophobic-whatever,""It has basically come to pass that the media labels him exactly the opposite of what he really is, the pitcher said.In the end, Schilling said he always remembers being booed in Yankee Stadium as a member of the Boston Red Sox.

In reality, Colorado has had campus carry since 2003 and the results are there for anyone to see. In fact, on April 20, 2015, the Washington Post ran a story on campus carry in Colorado that showed there have been no mass shootings, and, apart from one incident in which a gun was accidentally discharged by a Colorado University employee, there have been no crimes by permit holders.The WaPo piece was written by the Independent Institute's Dave Kopel, a scholar by any measure, and drawn from government sources, judicial decisions, crime reports, eyewitness testimony, and more. Far from increasing sexual assault, Kopel showed that campus carry, generally speaking, is especially good news for women, who are able to level the playing field by using a gun to fend off sexual attackers. He pointed to the U.S. Census Bureau's ""in-person interviews,"" conducted for the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), and showed that of the more than ""2,000 ... persons [who] disclosed they had been raped or sexually assaulted"" between 1992-2002, ""26 volunteered that they used a weapon to resist."" Then came the most pertinent part: ""In none of those 26 cases was the rape completed; in none of the cases did the victim suffer additional injury after she deployed her weapon.""Again, in the 26 cases where the women could use weapons, the rape and/or sexual assault ended.But BSPH approaches campus carry as if in a vacuum, claiming:Proposals to allow guns on college campuses must consider the fact that serious assaults and suicide attempts - which are more likely to be lethal when firearms are present - are far more common than are the rampage shooting incidents that the policies are purported to prevent. Inserting more firearms into those assaults and suicide attempts by allowing more people to have firearms on campuses is likely to lead to more deaths and serious injuries.Very similar arguments were made by the anti-gun crowd when Florida became a ""shall-issue"" concealed carry state in the late 1980s, thereby launching a concealed carry movement that swept the nation on a state-by-state basis during the next three decades. Critics warned that concealed carry would turn Florida and subsequent states into the Wild West, that blood would run in the streets. In reality, crime abated when criminals figured out their would-be victims could shoot back. Moreover, the deadliest city in America is Chicago-a city where gun control and the vestiges of gun control have created a metropolis where the criminals are heavily armed but law-abiding citizens have trouble finding guns for self-defense.College campuses have largely been mandated to follow the Chicago experiment. Law-abiding citizens have been denied their Second Amendment rights on campus while criminals have ignored gun-free prohibitions and carried guns anyway. The campus carry movement, as demonstrated by Colorado, portends an end to this scenario. And BSPH is circling the wagons as people rally state-by-state to pull down yet another aspect of the left's senseless gun control infrastructure.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

21	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/26/att-time-warner-deal-perspective-great-trustbuster/	The AT&T-Time Warner Deal: Perspective from the Great Trustbuster	"First of Three PartsSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER by Virgil, with Theodore RooseveltOkay, this is confusing to me: Two big corporations, AT&T (worth $221 billion at last count) and Time Warner (worth $66 billon), want to combine to become even bigger, and yet in response, the two major American political parties are not to be found in their usual ideological positions.Today it's the Republican, Donald Trump, himself a big businessman, who is loudly opposed to the mega-merger, while the Democrat, Hillary Clinton, seems to be quietly in favor of it.  Huh?  Again, I'll admit, I find it hard to understand; perhaps you, do, too.  So before I get to my interview with Theodore Roosevelt . . .Wait, there seems to be a murmur: Some are asking, how can I be claiming to have an interview with Theodore Roosevelt--the Theodore Roosevelt, America's 26th president--when, in fact, he died in 1919?  Well, that's a good question, which I can only answer this way: How is it possible that you are reading something from Virgil--the Virgil, the designated bard of the Roman Empire--when he died in 19 BC?  So that's my answer: If it's possible to hear from Virgil, then it's also possible to hear from Teddy Roosevelt.  And so, unless there are further questions, I will proceed.  I am confident, indeed, that you will be hearing the authentic views of the historical TR, updated to today.But first, let's get back to Saturday, October 22, 2016, in Gettysburg, PA, when Donald Trump, the Republican real estate mogul who has discovered his inner populist, spoke out in fierce opposition to the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger, describing it as ""a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.""So we must also ask: Where does Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, stand on this high-flying issue?  So far at least, she has said nothing critical of the deal; she has left it to a campaign spokesman to offer this thick dollop of mush:We think that marketplace competition is a good and healthy thing for consumers, and so there's a number of questions and concerns that arise in that vein about this announced deal, but there's still a lot of information that needs to come out before, before any conclusions should be reached.  Certainly, [Clinton] thinks that regulators should scrutinize it closely.Those are nice words, not saying anything--nicely. Meanwhile, of course, in the minds of the two companies, the deal is already on track: So if the government doesn't actively step in to stop it, it will happen.  And if Clinton is happy just saying that she wants the deal to be ""scrutinized,"" well, those are just words, rolling off the dealmakers like water off a walrus.  We know that the deal will be scrutinized; the question is, will it be stopped?Here we can pause to make two points:The first point is that there's a significant backstory on the whole subject of corporate mergers, mostly on the Democratic side of the aisle.  Way back when--that is, during his 2008 presidential campaign--Barack Obama pledged to ""reinvigorate antitrust enforcement."" And yet his actual record in office has been much different.In fact, during the the last eight years of the Obama administration, we have seen record levels of business concentration.  For example, in 2010, Northwest Airlines merged into Delta Airlines; in 2012, Continental Airlines merged into American Airlines; and in 2013, US Air merged, also, into American Airlines.  And so today, just four companies are in control of more than 80 percent of the market.Okay, now let's look at another business sector: health insurance.  In the last few years, Aetna and Humana have merged, as well as Anthem and Cigna, and so the traditional Big Five have become the Big Three.  And we could make the same point about the accelerated concentration of the banking industry in the wake of the 2008-9 bailouts; today, in spite of all the talk about not wanting banks that are ""too big to fail,"" just five banks control almost half of the banking sector's assets.In addition, we can consider the super-sizing of the cable/broadband sector: After Charter Communications' takeover of both Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks earlier this year, two companies, Charter and Comcast, will control, according to Consumer Reports, between 70 and 90 percent of the high-speed broadband market. (Yes, that's right, until just a few years ago, Time Warner had significant cable assets in the former of Time Warner Cable; the company chose to sell them off.  And yet now, if the AT&T deal goes through, Time Warner will once again be joined to a cable company.)Here we might insert that economists generally draw a bright line between ""vertical integration"" and ""horizontal integration""; both are terms of art in law and economics.  A vertically integrated company owns an entire supply chain, from production to distribution.  By contrast, a horizontally integrated company owns an entire market segment, or at least a big share of it.Traditionally, regulators have looked more askance at horizontal integration, since it's more obviously a monopoly if one or two companies control all the sales of a given category of product.We might also note that the corporate sectors cited above--airlines, health insurance, banking, and cable--are all examples of horizontal integration.  So yes, anyone conscious of antitrust issues has a perfect right to wonder what the Obama administration has been doing these past eight years, and why.By contrast, the AT&T-Time Warner deal looks rather harmless, because it's a case of vertical integration.  That is, if the acquisition goes through, it will not decrease the number of business players in either the content-creation sector (Time Warner), or the content-distribution sector (AT&T).Yet the new deal will still face hurdles, because most people, including most politicians, don't draw fine distinctions between vertical and horizontal integration.  All they know, or think they know, is that ""Big"" is bad.Indeed, some leading Democrats, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have already come out strongly against the deal, as part of their crusade against Big Business overall. We can observe that this rising tide of left-populist activism has swept like a tidal wave through the Democratic Party in the last year or so, threatening to wash away the pro-corporate stance of President Obama and, before him, of Bill Clinton.  (In fact, sometimes it seems as though Sanders and Warren sound more like Trump than Obama.)And for sure, in the last quarter-century, Big has has been growing Bigger.  As The Economist reported in September, the share of GDP generated by the 100 largest US companies has risen substantially in the last two decades, from 33 percent of GDP in 1994 to 46 percent in 2013.  That's a lot of concentration, no matter how one looks at it.So that's the context for today, when we can wonder: Where does the Obama administration stand on the AT&T-Time Warner deal?In fact, the administration hasn't formally taken a position, but oftentimes, actions speak louder than words.  Hence this headline in Monday's Washington Post: ""FCC may not be involved in reviewing AT&T's big deal: Absence could make it easier for company to absorb Time Warner.""  In other words, the Obama Justice Department, led by Obama loyalist Loretta Lynch, will examine the deal, but not the Federal Communications Commission, which has often been more skeptical of such mergers.  Such was the case, for example, in 2011, when the FCC blocked AT&T from buying T-Mobile.  (That failed deal was an instance of would-be horizontal integration.)So today, it's safe to say that if the administration wanted the FCC in the mix, it would indeed be there.  And yet the word ""Obama"" does not even appear in that Post story.  To put the matter another way: As part of its overall policy of allowing most mergers to go forward, the Obama administration appears to want the AT&T-Time Warner deal to slip through as well, with the minimum possible fuss.Of course, the big variable, these days, is Hillary Clinton.  As we wait to hear more from her on this deal, we might add this footnote: Time Warner employees and political action committees have given Clinton more than $800,000 during the course of her career; Time Warner, in fact, ranks as her ninth-largest donor.Indeed, Clinton seems quite comfortable around big money--and big money seems  equally comfortable around her.  By the end of September, Hillary had raised $1.14 billion for her 2016 campaign; that takes a lot of schmoozing and hobnobbing.  In fact, she and her husband Bill have raised an astonishing $4 billion during the course of their careers.  That indeed suggests an epic amount of schmoozing and hobnobbing, and it's easy to see how the interests of the business and financial elite would come to take precedence in her mind over any other considerations.  In fact, it's also easy to see how the Clintons' personal wealth would affect their overall worldview: Just in the years 2007-2015, Bill and Hillary added $139 million to their net worth.  Once again, that's a lot of schmoozing and hobnobbing with fatcats.Yet still, Hillary Clinton is a Democrat.  Therefore she talks, frequently, about raising taxes on the rich and bringing back ""fairness.""  Indeed, she pledges to change the ""rigged game."" And yet for their part, the rich riggers don't seem to mind; not only do they not see her as a threat, they see her actually as an ally.So we might ask: How could this be?  Perhaps the explanation for this plutocratic complacency can be found in this 2015 headline from Politico: ""Clinton's Wall Street backers: We get it/ Populist rhetoric, many say, is good politics--but doesn't portend an assault on the rich.""  In other words, maybe for Hillary it's all an act--a cosmic joke on her non-plutocrat supporters.Okay, so now for the second point to be made: A specific wrinkle in the AT&T-Time Warner deal is that Time Warner owns CNN.  And here's Trump on that:As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN.Ah yes, CNN.  That news channel, sometimes called the ""Clinton News Network,"" threatens to symbolize the whole deal, eclipsing everything else in the AT&T-Time Warner corporate array--the Harry Potter franchise, people's mobile phone contracts, and so on.  As Trump has said, CNN is ""biased and very dumb,"" and millions of Americans agree, at least, with his argument about CNN's bias.Trump's accusation of bias is bolstered by the Media Research Center (MRC), the conservative watchdog group, which has monitored CNN for decades.  Just on October 18, noting that CNN's Brian Stelter had dismissed allegations of collusion between reporters and the Hillary Clinton campaign--Stelter had labeled the allegations as ""false,"" ""ludicrous,"" and even ""damaging""-- MRC's Brent Bozell Tim Graham jibed back at Stelter, ""On what planet does this man live?  Even by Clinton News Network standards, this is ridiculous.""  In other words, in Bozell and Graham's view, the CNN man was far from candid about MSM bias.To further illustrate the level of open hostility between Trump and CNN, we can add that just on Monday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller blasted a CNN story--while on CNN:That piece [on Trump and the polls] from Jim Acosta was one of the most heavily-edited, most dishonest intro packages I've probably ever had set up.  . . . Everything from Kellyanne [Conway]'s words to the description of what's going on in the race was just nonsense.Needless to say, such hostility works both ways.  So we can conclude that by openly declaring his opposition to CNN itself, as well as to its corporate interests--including its possible purchase by AT&T--Trump has amplified the network's already vehement antipathy toward him.Yet without a doubt, Trump is striking a resonant chord with the right-of-center audience, which was already mostly convinced that the MSM has been out to get them.  For instance, there's an October 9 column by Carl Cannon, appearing in the The Orange County Register: The 2016 election will be remembered as one in which much of the mainstream media all but admitted aligning itself with the Democratic PartyIn fact, some on the cultural left concede the point: On October 23, comedian Michael Che said on Saturday Night Live, ""It does seem like virtually every media outlet is doing everything in their power to prevent a Trump presidency.""And we can't leave this subject without taking note of Dana Milbank's column in the October 24 edition of The Washington Post. Milbank took the extraordinary step of declaring that the normal rules of journalistic objectivity should not apply to reporters covering the Trump campaign.  As the Post-man put it:In an ordinary presidential campaign, press neutrality is essential.  But in Trump we have somebody who has threatened democracy by talking about banning an entire religion from entering the country; forcing Muslims in America to register with authorities; rewriting press laws and prosecuting his critics and political opponents; blacklisting news organizations he doesn't like; ordering the military to do illegal things such as torture and targeting innocents; and much more.  In this case, attempting neutrality legitimized the illegitimate.Okay, so that's Milbank's opinion.  And here's the opinion of many, if not most, Republicans: MSM reporters are Democratic Party operatives with bylines.Of course, Democrats see things differently.  For openers, they reject the media-bias accusation.  And yet increasingly, as we have seen, Democrats have come to accept their growing congruence with corporate-media interests.  And in the meantime, Trumpists, as well as many Democrats, are becoming more and more populist, in defiance of the last couple of Democratic presidents.I'll admit, this is confusing for me, Virgil, to understand.I mean, I am--okay, I was--the greatest Latin poet, for Jupiter's sake!  I was the court-favorite of the legendary Augustus Caesar.  So sure, I learned a lot about imperial politics hanging around the Domus Augustii.  And yet how in Hades am I supposed to figure out American politics when the familiar partisan battle lines are shifting so profoundly?So to help me make sense of this, I knew I needed some help from a solid source, deeply embedded in the history of antitrust enforcement--Teddy Roosevelt.  That interview is coming up next.Next in Part Two: My exclusive interview with Theodore Roosevelt.We think that marketplace competition is a good and healthy thing for consumers, and so there's a number of questions and concerns that arise in that vein about this announced deal, but there's still a lot of information that needs to come out before, before any conclusions should be reached.

The most recent poll in Pennsylvania showed Trump winning 29% of the black vote, and 30% of the Hispanic vote, in the Keystone State.""Here's the promise I make to you: whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. We live in a very divided country, but I will be your greatest champion,"" he said.""Our opponent represents the rigged system and the failed thinking of yesterday,"" he said, adding that Hillary Clinton's campaign represented pessimism. ""She's been doing this for thirty years, and for thirty years it's only gotten worse.""Trump's voice, slightly hoarse, brightened when he described his ""movement"" -- ""there's never been anything like it in this country,"" he said. He described the opportunity for change in the political system as ""once in a lifetime.""He went on to describe the many sacrifices made by African Americans for the country -- and the dire state of the community today.""In 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18%, and it's expected to rise to 24% this year,"" he said. He noted that Democrats had governed in African American communities for decades -- and achieved nothing.Trump shaped his broader economic policies for a specifically African American audience. describing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a threat to jobs in the black community, and talking about illegal immigration as a violation of the civil rights of black Americans. ""We won't let your jobs be stolen from you anymore,"" he said.He added that he would cancel subsidies for climate change, ""including all global warming payments to the United Nations,"" and redirect what he said would be $100 billion over eight years into inner city infrastructure.On education, Trump said: ""School choice is the civil rights issue of our time."" He vowed to be the ""greatest champion"" of school choice for disadvantaged children.He also touted vocational education, remarking that everyone knew classmates who were less adept at book learning but who could take apart a television with their eyes closed, drawing applause from the crowd.On public safety, Trump -- who has often cast himself as the law-and-order candidate -- said that he had listened to the concerns of the black community, and that under his administration, the law would be applied ""fairly, equally, and without prejudice.""He also slammed what he called a double standard that benefited Hillary Clinton, saying that if he had done what she had done, he would receive ""the electric chair.""He noted that Clinton associate Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia, had given nearly $500,000 in campaign donations to the wife of the deputy director of the FBI as Clintons case was under consideration.Later, in discussing corruption, Trump was met with chants of ""Drain the swamp!"", his latest slogan on the campaign trail.Trump added that his ""new deal"" also included ""the protection of religious liberty,"" which drew a standing ovation. He vowed ""support for the African-American church,"" which he said had been a ""tremendous power"" in America.He closed with a swipe at Obamacare, reminding the audience that Obama had lied to sell the plan. ""Obamacare is now destroying our health care system."" He noted that premiums in Arizona were soaring 118%. ""Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing ... If we don't repeal and replace Obamacare, we will lose our health care system forever.""The audience was a diverse one, and welcomed Trump warmly.Herb, an international marketing specialist from Fort Mill, South Carolina, told Breitbart News he expects Trump to win North Carolina decisively despite polls showing a statistical dead heat -- thanks to the role of silent Trump supporters.""I'm Puerto Rican. I'm Latino. I'm supposed to be a Democrat. I just came out of the closet,"" he said. ""How can anybody by happy with the idea of Hillary Clinton as president? Considering all she's done -- not said, but done.""Prior to the address, Trump had met backstage with a group of African-American faith and community leaders from North Carolina.Joel B.

Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt doesn't help that white voters can't agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they'll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross.The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats -- the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants.The people who will be worse off are everybody else -- the working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society.Look to Mexico for your future -- or any Third World country. Or to Univision's Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.)Explaining Latino culture's acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that ""the male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. ... Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.""One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an ""open mind"" about child rape because ""it's a cultural thing.""When it comes to multiculturalism, you can't say, We love the empanadas -- but we don't want 40-year-old men raping their nieces. This isn't an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures we're importing.As described in excruciating detail in Adios, America: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole, our media already have a totally ""open mind"" about incest and child rape -- and murder! -- when it's committed by immigrants.Thus, for example, where I would have chosen the headline: ""Illegal Alien Convicted of Incest, Child Rape,"" The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times Free Press went with the less catchy: ""Man guilty in case of human smuggling.""And where I would have used the headline, ""Illegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14-year-old Girl at Job Site,"" The Commercial Dispatch in Columbus, Mississippi, went with the more subtle, ""Columbus resident charged with molestation.""Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too -- provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled.In 1989, Brooklyn judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from ""traditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood."" The female head of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Margaret Fung, applauded the ruling.Somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. (Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing!)In 2013, a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack.When the news first broke, Shaneequa Jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. (That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants!)Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for ""Austin men."" Or ""Two.""Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack:-- ""Two held in attack on child"" -- Austin American-Statesman (Texas), July 19, 2013-- ""Two Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over five-day gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack"" -- Daily Mail Online, July 24, 2013Needless to say, The New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegal alien gang rape at all.By contrast, the Times, and every major American news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape -- of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place.The second case only was ""rape"" because of the girl's young age -- she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex.Those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a full-court press. The defendants were African-American. The victim was Mexican.That time, there were articles in the Huffington Post, GQ, Slate, Salon and Mother Jones. It even made The New York Times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team.Similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur, Alabama, for assaults on 9-year-old girls. One suspect was African-American, the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one?When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square (another one of Hillary's foreign policy successes!), journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men.Conclusion: The real problem was the female reporters' American bosses and colleagues. (Definitely not Islam!)Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logan's rape:-- ""Why We Need Women in War Zones"" (""I would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened. ... This attack also had nothing to do with Islam."")-- ""Reporting While Female"" (""Women reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not. ... In my experience, Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment."")Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good.Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans -- or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. (The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher.)Our country will be Zimbabwe, but -- if all goes according to the Democrats' plan -- they'll get to be Mugabe!That's Hillary's dream. If she wins, Joe Sobran's parody of the typical New York Times headline (about anything) will come true: ""Women and Minorities Hit Hardest.""SIGN UP"
24	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/26/poll-half-americans-say-things-better-fifties/	Poll: Half of Americans Say Things Were Better in the Fifties	"In a new survey, a non-profit organization called PRRI put an interesting spin on the traditional ""right track, wrong track"" polling question by asking if ""American culture and way of life have changed for the worse or better since the 1950s."" It turns out a slim majority think the Fifties were better, by 51% to 48%.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThis is a new angle because pollsters usually ask if the country is on the ""wrong track"" without giving a specific example of what the ""right track"" would look like. They ask if the country is getting ""worse"" in some general sense, without asking the respondents to imagine what ""better"" would look like.The standard right-track/wrong-track question was asked, too, and 74% said America is ""seriously off on the wrong track, a much higher level of pessimism than PRRI found in 2012.The poll's internals put the question in the context of the current election by noting that 72% of declared Donald Trump supporters thought American ""society and way of life"" have changed for the worse over the past 60 years, while a comparable percentage of Hillary Clinton's voters (70%) say they have changed for the better. Racial and class divisions were visible in the responses as well. Sixty-two percent of black respondents and 57% of Hispanics said things have gotten better since the Fifties, while 56% of whites said the reverse. However, 56% of college-educated whites said better, while 65% of ""white working-class Americans"" said worse.White evangelical Protestants reportedly had the most dour view of social evolution since the Fifties, with 74% of them saying culture has changed for the worse.Those who feel American culture and politics have taken a wrong turn expressed a strong sense of frustration and alienation in various other poll questions. Forty-six percent of poll respondents endorsed the notion of ""a leader who is willing to break some rules, if that's what it takes to set things right,"" with 55% of declared Republicans supporting that idea. Sixty-one percent of respondents said neither major party represents their views any more, a 13-point increase since 1990. Clinton and Trump both have historically low approval ratings for presidential candidates, although Clinton fares better on most attributes. Fifty-seven percent said big money has so much influence on elections that their vote scarcely matters. Only 43% of respondents expressed a great deal of confidence that their votes would be counted accurately.(In an interesting side note to that last dismal statistic, respondents were evenly divided about whether illegal voters, or eligible voters unfairly denied the right to vote, were a more serious problem, but only 9% thought ""voter apathy"" was the biggest problem with American elections. The media and political class thinks voter apathy is a much bigger problem than the actual electorate does.)To be sure, the terms in many of these questions are highly subjective. ""Since the 1950s, do you think American culture and way of life has mostly changed for the better, or has it mostly changed for the worse?"" is a very big question, especially given that many of the poll respondents weren't around during the Fifties and Sixties. Younger people on the Left side of the American political spectrum are generally given a negative view of the Fifties, especially with respect to racism and stodgy, judgmental ""Ozzie and Harriet"" culture, while the late Sixties are seen as a mystical transformative experience. Young people on the Right are more likely to hear about the virtues of those earlier times, or to be concerned about modern trends in divorce, illegitimacy, and middle-class career anxiety. Both the good and bad things happened, of course, but a holistic view of a half-century's worth of culture will depend on emphasis.It seems likely that if most people on the Right were asked what ""going back to the Fifties"" would mean, they'd talk about restoring family and community values, strengthening the rule of law, and shoring up the economy for working-class people, but they wouldn't want to repeal the Civil Rights Act. On the other hand, ask the average campus liberal what going back to the Fifties means, and ""turning back the clock"" on civil rights, or gay rights, will be a common, contemptuous response. It's curious to think that our supposedly tolerant friends on the Left would take pleasure in the notion of white Christians feeling marginalized and frustrated, as such a poll suggests. Shouldn't Utopia have a place for them, too? Even if they were a tiny minority, shouldn't their views be respected in a vibrant and healthy Republic? (Follow-up question: how many generations do they have to be marginalized and powerless before they're no longer considered ""oppressors"" who can be discriminated against with abandon by our political system?)There will be a temptation for liberals to denounce this Republican affection for the Fifties as incoherent, dreamy nostalgia, but there are plenty of social indicators that are empirically worse today. We should be able to preserve what's good about the present without abandoning the wisdom of the past, on subjects where the ""wrong track"" can be mapped with hard, cold statistics.Another debatable assertion is that support for a leader ""willing to break some rules, if that's what it takes to set things right"" equals an embrace of ""authoritarianism,"" as PRRI puts it. For one thing, that's not the definition of authoritarianism. A nation can sink very far into authoritarian hell under leadership that doesn't actually break its own rules.More to the point, we're emerging from eight years under a leader, President Barack Obama, who most certainly does believe he should ""break some rules, if that's what it takes to set things right."" It's the defining characteristic of his presidency. He's come very close to using those exact words on many occasions, when pushing his notion of a unitary executive who shouldn't have to put up with ""gridlock"" and ""obstructionism,"" no matter what the rules say, including the Constitution. Some Republicans who responded positively to the idea of a leader who breaks the rules to do what's right are merely asking for leadership that fights on Obama's terms, or accepting that Obama's actions have permanently redefined the role of the President. Conversely, very few Obama supporters would agree that his ""breaking the rules to set things right"" makes him an authoritarian. If the Trump-Clinton contest leads to a great national bipartisan conversation on the evils of authoritarianism, it will have a silver lining.Take all the responses from the PRRI poll together, and we might form a hypothesis that much of the ""wrong track"" feeling that grips American voters stems from their sense of helplessness, their anger at a top-down system that doesn't represent their interests, or grant them the independence to make their own decisions. People on the Left and Right have very different ideas about who the masters of that system are, and those differences make meaningful political cooperation difficult. We should have the wisdom to agree that claiming America has made no major mistakes since the Fifties is as absurd as claiming it has done nothing right.
