""We fought a revolution so that we would not have a king.""Clinton made her remarks during another campaign rally in Florida, and she again argued that Trump was a threat to democracy and the Constitution because he attacked the media and wanted to ban Muslims from moving to the United States.""We don't impose religious tests at our borders because we are a country that was founded on religious liberty,"" she said. ""We don't punish newspapers and journalists that try to cover the news or critical of politicians or threaten to limit the First Amendment because our democracy depends on a free press.""During the rally, several supporters started singing ""Birthday"" to Clinton.

Call into the show: (877) 240-1776""It feels like my second Opening Day,"" he said.Schilling's show is heard weekdays from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. online at Breitbart.com and it is the first live audio program Breitbart News has produced exclusively.The six-time All Star pitcher told listeners he wanted an open-handed and open-minded relationship with them and he wanted lots of caller interaction.""Anything is on the table and everything is on the table,"" he said. ""I will answer as honestly as I can-I might not give you the answer you are looking for.""The first topic Schilling opened up with was the scandal in the Golden State, where California National Guardsmen are being dunned for erroneous bonuses paid during the height of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.Schilling said 10,000 soldiers were given bonuses up to $50,000 that were given by mistake, so the government is looking to take them back-with interest.""What is our government doing?"" he asked.This ""horrific action"" is another example of the government's inept and embarrassing job performance and disconnect from what normal Americans expect, he said.It is made all the worse when the treatment of the military personnel, many of them combat veterans with multiple deployments, is compared to how others are treated, he said. ""They are being put through financial hardship, while our government spends hundreds of millions to billions of dollars on illegal immigrants-food, clothes, roof over their head.""No one is against taking care of the people in bad straits, but the government needs to prioritize, he said.He asked his listeners: ""How do we not put the well-being of soldiers and their families ahead of anything and everything else in this country?""The righthander played for five teams, but he is best known for his heroism on the mound for the Boston Red Sox during their 2004 championship run, so it was a special moment when Mike from Boston called in-like the reunion of old friends.Mike told Schilling that he worked for many years as a television news cameraman and technician in the Massachusetts capital. ""I could tell you story after story after story of-really-media bias.""The cameraman said one example was during the 1994 Senate race between Democrat Sen. Edward M. Kennedy Sr., and his GOP challenger W. Mitt Romney, when he was working with a reporter who asked him to review a two-minute news package she had done on the two men.""She turns to me and says: 'I think we were very fair about that.' I just kind of looked at her and my eyes almost blew out of my head. Then, the reporter said: 'I gave them equal time,'"" said Mike.The Bostonian told Schilling that he rolled back the tape for the reporter. ""Right here, you say 'Kennedy' with an almost reverend voice-I rolled tape back a little bit more-and right here, you're saying Mitt Romney as if you are spitting mad and that's supposed to be even?""Mike said these little nuances in media coverage are there every single day, every single hour to spin stories for the Left.But, with new media, like Whatever It Takes or rallies for Donald J. Trump online with 250,000 viewers, he thinks it is getting better for conservatives, Mike said.Schilling said media bias for the left-wing is not a conspiracy theory. ""It is happening. It doesn't make me feel any different-again-I live in the real world-I understand it. I get it. The media wants Trump out and wants Clinton in. I just wish they had enough guts to admit it.""What may have been a tough thing for Schilling to admit or talk about came up in a discussion about how the media portrays Trump's businesses going through the bankruptcy process.Scott, a caller from Mississippi, said bankruptcy is part of doing business and is a regular process to deal with poor business conditions, not always a sign of failure.The three-time World Series champion told Scott that he went through his own business failure with ""38 Studios,"" which went into bankruptcy in 2012 after Schilling ran out of cash and could not secure financing to carry him into the revenue stream he expected from the role-player game his company released, ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.""Schilling said he put in $50 million of his own money, in addition to the guaranteed loan from the state of Rhode Island that he received when he agreed to move the company there. ""We went bankrupt. It was my fault.""But, none of the money went into his pocket, he said. It went to cover payroll and taxes and the cost of running the business.""We had 3oo employees,"" he said.""That money goes right back into the economy and if it doesn't somebody is committing a crime-but, at the end of the day, capitalism is about the survival of the fittest,"" he said.It was all an experience that taught him that having the government involved in business in any way is wrong, he said.""The problem is that no one wants to hear it.""You can hear Whatever It Takes weekdays from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., online at Breitbart.com.Join the show as a caller: (877) 240-1776SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Romney', 'Trump', 'Kennedy']	[]

""Clinton has promised to send a comprehensive immigration reform bill to Congress within her first 100 days in office if elected...""Clinton's campaign website has made clear that by ""comprehensive immigration reform,"" Clinton means citizenship for illegal immigrants, which would give them welfare access, voting privileges, and the ability to bring over their family members through chain migration.According to the report, Clinton's staff and allies understand that Speaker Ryan supports amnesty, and, as such, they view him as the key to enacting Clinton's immigration agenda.""[Clinton campaign spokesman Brian] Fallon noted that Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in concept supports both infrastructure investment and immigration reform,"" The Hill reports.""[Sen. Chuck] Schumer told NBC's John Harwood in an interview this week that he thinks both immigration reform and an infrastructure package can pass in the new Congress. He said both policies come to mind because they are backed by Clinton, Ryan and himself,"" The Hill writes.Schumer predicted that Republicans like Ryan will tell conservatives who oppose Clinton's immigration agenda to ""go take a hike,"" according to the report: ""Schumer predicted that 'mainstream conservatives in the Senate and House' will tell 'the hard right,' who are staunchly opposed to immigration reform, to 'go take a hike' if they try to quash reform.""The report seems to reinforce predictions previously made by Sen. Tim Kaine, who has said that under a President Clinton and Speaker Ryan, amnesty would be enacted within the first 100 days of a Clinton-Kaine administration.In a private speech made public by WikiLeaks, Clinton told Goldman Sachs executives that Americans who want to limit immigration are ""fundamentally un-American""--an astonishing statement given the fact that according to Pew polling data, 83 percent of the American electorate would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.Only 15 percent of American voters--and seven percent of Republican voters--agree with the Clinton-Ryan vision of increasing immigration.Given Ryan's record on the issue, it is not surprising Democrats believe he will help advance their 2017 efforts to enact amnesty. As a 2015 PBS documentary revealed, in 2013 and 2014 Ryan worked behind closed doors with Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez and other pro-amnesty Republicans to craft an immigration bill and whip House Republicans to support the donor-class's immigration expansion agenda. PBS reported that Ryan's stealth effort was nearly successful--having crafted a bill that he knew the majority of Republicans could support. According to the PBS documentary, had it not been for Eric Cantor's ejection as House Majority Leader, then-Speaker John Boehner likely would have brought Ryan's bill up for a vote and his amnesty plan likely would have passed.In 2015, immediately following Ryan's announcement that he was running for House Speaker, conservatives expressed concern that his Speakership would ultimately lead to an amnesty push in 2017. As one senior GOP aide told Breitbart News last year, ""Speaker Ryan will usher through the most detrimental bill in modern America. He will enjoy working with Luis Gutierrez to craft it, and President Anyone-but-Trump will celebrate signing it into law.""At the time, nationally syndicated radio host Rush Limbaugh warned that the effort to install Ryan as House Speaker was all about getting ""the donor-class agenda... implemented, including amnesty and whatever else they want. That is the objective here. That's what I think this all adds up to,"" Limbaugh said.As Breitbart News previously reported, Ryan has a long history of advocating for globalist policies on trade and immigration. Indeed, Ryan shares Clinton's support for open borders and supports the importation of foreign workers to compete against American white-collar and blue-collar workers. As NBC's Chuck Todd has explained, Ryan is ""an internationalist"" who supports the ""open borders"" ideology on immigration.Bernie Sanders told Vox in 2015 that ""open borders"" is ""a Koch brothers proposal"" that ""would make everybody in America poorer"" by allowing employers to ""bring in all kinds of people [who will] work for $2 or $3 an hour."" Sanders said that ""open borders... says essentially there is no United States"" and amounts to ""doing away with the concept of a nation-state.""""Both Democrats and Republicans are funded by big corporate interests,"" Stein wrote, noting that Washington's ""uni-party"" works to advance the goals of its transnational donors rather than the desires of the American electorate. Stein and her party have argued that the Democratic and Republican parties that ""cuddle up to Wall Street and special interests"" essentially ""agree on [a] neoliberal agenda"" of ""globalization... [and] austerity for the rest of us.""SIGN UPHillary ClintonPaul Ryan"	['Sanders', 'Rush', 'Clinton', 'Schumer', 'Hill', 'Paul']	[]

(AP) -- Donald Trump was out of bounds when he accused rival Hillary Clinton of committing a ""criminal act"" by giving large campaign contributions to the wife of an FBI official who later supervised the agency's investigation into Clinton's email practices when she was secretary of state.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSpeaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Trump reacted to a Wall Street Journal report that Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe helped fund the failed state Senate campaign of the FBI official's wife. Noting that Democrat McAuliffe is close to the Clintons, Trump said any donation from McAuliffe amounts to a donation from the Democratic presidential candidate.""Now, that's Clinton giving the money, because that's how close they are,"" Trump said. ""She gave money at a huge clip, $675,000 to the wife of the FBI agent who was in charge of her investigation. Let me tell you something -- that's a criminal act.""Trump may have a legitimate gripe about the FBI's conflict-of-interest policies, but his assertion that Clinton tried to influence a key investigator through donations to his wife are incorrect because her husband didn't become involved in the email probe until after her bid for office had already failed. There's also no indication that the timing and amount of McAuliffe's donations were anything but routine.Virginia Democrats, led by Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, identified and began recruiting Dr. Jill McCabe to run for the state Senate months before the FBI began its investigation into Clinton's emails. And the FBI says McCabe's husband, Andrew McCabe, was promoted to deputy director of the FBI and took a supervisory role in the email investigation three months after his wife's unsuccessful campaign had ended.To persuade Jill McCabe to run, McAuliffe and other top state Democrats met with her and her husband in March 2015. It was the only time McAuliffe met Andrew McCabe, according to his spokesman.That meeting came a few days after the first media reports that Clinton had used a private email address and server while serving as secretary of state. The FBI's investigation began in July 2015.McAuliffe's political action committee gave McCabe nearly $500,000 during the course of her campaign, beginning before the investigation started and continuing after it was underway. Some of the largest donations came closer to Election Day and were around the same time as other donations he made to other Democrats in tight races. The Democratic Party of Virginia, for which McAuliffe also helps raise money, spent another $200,000 on McCabe's race.There's also nothing unusual about the overall size of those donations, as McCabe's race was one of only a handful of competitive state Senate districts in 2015.Democrats have long wanted to oust GOP state Senator Dick Black, an outspoken conservative and abortion foe, and thought that having a female physician like McCabe as their candidate was their best shot. In Virginia, which has virtually no rules on political fundraising, sitting governors are expected to use their clout to raise big money and help their party succeed in off-year legislative elections such as those in 2015.McAuliffe's spokesman Brian Coy said McAuliffe supported McCabe ""solely because she shared his vision for Virginia and any insinuation otherwise is ridiculous at best, reckless at worst.""The FBI said in a statement that Andrew McCabe sought guidance from agency ethics officers and recused himself of ""all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics"" throughout his wife's campaign.It's true that McAuliffe has longstanding ties with Clinton and her husband. He led the effort to raise money for Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election bid, vacationed with the couple after the Monica Lewinsky scandal and secured a $1.35 million mortgage on their house in Chappaqua, New York, after they left the White House swamped by legal debts. McAuliffe also helped manage Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid.The state senator who defeated Jill McCabe, Dick Black, said he doesn't know why the governor helped recruit McCabe to run against him. But Black, a former high-ranking prosecutor at the Pentagon and Trump supporter, said he's sure Andrew McCabe shouldn't have been anywhere close to the Clinton email investigation after his wife's campaign received significant help from McAuliffe.SIGN UP"	['McAuliffe', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	['abortion']

""That started a decades-long career as what Dylan Howard, the current editor, has called a fixer.""The interview was spurred by an interview Hannity did on his afternoon radio talk show with Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, where Hannity got the tabloid chief to promise to consider allowing Hannity to bring Rovin out from the shadows.But the tabloid really piqued Hannity's interests with a long expose of Rovin's claims to be the Clintons' media fixer. One of the stories even featured allegations of arrangements made for Hillary Clinton to engage in sexual trysts with both men and women. The paper said that it compiled Rovin's story based on 24 years of journals and records the author kept to track the stories he ""fixed"" over the years.Perhaps feeling the pressure from those who claim the Enquirer is a less-than-serious source, Hannity started his interview noting that the tabloid has a history of breaking stories that are real, hard news -- and true. Hannity mentioned scoops about O.J. Simpson, Gary Hart, Rush Limbaugh's drug problems, John Edwards mistress, Jesse Jackson's love child, Tiger Woods's marriage problems, and others.Rovin commented that one may not like the material that the tabloid publishes, ""but, ironically it is so heavily vetted because it is so controversial. It's probably better vetted than most of the stories in other media,"" the Clinton ""fixer"" exclaimed.Rovin told Hannity that, because he had been a writer of military thrillers, he knew ""generals"" and ""all the back doors of Washington"" so he was ideally suited to help Bill and Hillary torpedo stories they didn't want the media to cover.The author went on to say that his reason for coming out now to reveal his identity and his decades-long job as the Clintons' ""fixer"" was because the media world is topsy-turvy these days.""I wanted to write an editorial condemning the salacious nature of political reporting now,"" Rovin told Hannity. ""The New York Times has become the Enquirer, the Enquirer has become The New York Times. The world is upside down. We've got to set it right again,"" he insisted.The Clintons' sex life wasn't anything that bothered him, Rovin told Hannity. ""To me, it's not my business and it's nobody else's business.""But Rovin said one of the reasons he continued as the Clintons' ""fixer"" was because he became seduced by the power and prestige of Washington D.C.Hannity brought up Monica Lewinsky, and Rovin claims he personally apologized to her for his part in her troubled life after her affair with Bill Clinton exploded across the nation.Rovin went on to say that he had spoken to Hillary on several occasions about some of their media bombshells he was tasked with covering up. He noted that every time he met Hillary, he was bringing her bad news.Reported Clinton ""fixer"" Jeff Rovin: ""Every time I saw @HillaryClinton, I was bringing bad news. The messenger got shot."" #Hannity-- Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 25, 2016Rovin also noted that Hillary was often furious that Bill or one of their underlings got caught forcing them to ""fix"" a story.Reported Clinton ""fixer"" Jeff Rovin: ""Every time...the Pres. got into trouble, it was just 'how could you get caught' [from HRC.]""-- Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 25, 2016""Smearing happened, money was paid, orders were given,"" Hannity said, ""you were to go out and damage the reputation of Monica Lewinsky"" and people like her.While saying he didn't personally go out to besmirch Lewinsky or any of the Clintons' other enemies, Rovin said he was ""part of a team effort"" to do just that.Rovin also confirmed that Bill and Hillary have a very tense relationship. ""If screaming is to be taken as validation,"" Rovin said, ""there were harsh words behind closed doors,"" exchanged between Bill and Hillary, ""that we all heard.""The political ""fixer"" also alleged that the Clintons' goal was to ""destroy"" Monica Lewinsky and others like her. But he also noted that, at some point, even Bill Clinton pulled back on the attacks on Monica because he felt it was going too far.""It's a stinking business,"" Rovin said, ""It's an absolutely stinking business.""Hannity wrapped up his interview by asking who Rovin was going to vote for. While he said he likes Trump well enough, the author refused to say for whom he was voting next month.Rovin has not been completely invisible in the public eye. He has a long public career as a writer for science fiction, comic books, video gaming, and action novels, and he says he is currently working on a TV serialization of one of his adventure novels.

Quite unrelated, the economy went through another rough winter and spring with GDP advancing at only a 1.1 percent annual rate.The economy improved in the third quarter, and added an average of 192,000 jobs each month. Unemployment has remained at about 5 percent, because adult labor force participation is ticking up as job opportunities become more attractive.Wages are up significantly for African Americans, and unemployment is down in presidential swing states, where restructuring in manufacturing has often killed jobs. Historically, as the economy reaches full employment the pockets more resistant to wage and employment gains-- minorities and dislocated workers--experience the most robust progress.Also, retailers are hiring earlier for the holiday season, because the starting point for this shopping burst increasingly begins around Halloween instead of Thanksgiving and they expect challenges in finding suitable workers.Inflation picked up in September and should be stronger going forward as gasoline, natural gas and other energy prices reflect the recent firming in oil prices.Although inflation has not pierced the Fed's 2 percent target, it is important for it to get out in front of wage and energy price pressures, while it still enjoys the latitude to gradually raise rates. An abrupt interest rate response to a surge in wages and prices could kill the economic expansion even though most families and many businesses have not fully recovered from the financial crisis.Even as the Fed raised short rates a notch last December, mortgage and Treasury rates moved lower as weakening economic conditions in China and political turmoil in Europe drove foreign investors into U.S. bonds. Lower rates have supported a stronger recovery in U.S. new home sales.Increasing short rates now would drive mortgage and other long rates higher, because the effects of the above-mentioned events abroad have been absorbed by capital markets. Gradually pushing rates up would permit prospective home buyers to process the prospects for higher inflation and recognize that real mortgage rates--the nominal less future inflation--remain attractive.Stocks are hardly overvalued given the abundance of financial capital around the world seeking higher yields. Businesses are using capital more efficiently these days (for example, software companies require less capital than traditional manufacturers to create new products). Together, those drive up underlying enterprise values and sustainable price-earnings ratios.Too often when Fed Chairwoman Yellen or one of her lieutenants musses the time is drawing near to finally raise rates, stocks take a nose dive, and more certainty about future policy is sorely needed to minimize counterproductive gyrations in the stock market.Conditions in China and Europe have pushed up the dollar against foreign currencies over the past two years, and gradually increasing interest rates would limit further appreciation that would hurt U.S.-based manufacturing and technology-intensive service activities that compete in international markets.Real estate, stock markets and the broader economy have prospered with much higher interest rates than we have now. In all of this, however, homebuyers and builders, investors and business leaders would like as much certainty from policymakers as a turbulent world permits.Next week, it would be best for Fed policymakers to avoid presidential politics and stand pat on short rates, but indicate a December increase is highly likely and further rate increases will be gradual and according to a schedule.The Fed should announce it will raise interest rates a modest one-eighth or one-sixteenth of a point at each of its forthcoming meetings going forward--and stick to the schedule unless substantial changes in the economic data warrant.A policy of normalizing interest rates with some certainty as to pacing should permit the economic recovery to continue without labor markets overheating or inflation flying out of control.Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.

In reality, however, her gun controls are broad measures ""that would affect Americans with no criminal records"" while having very little impact on the behavior of criminals.For example, Clinton is calling ""for a reinstatement of the national assault weapons ban and a prohibition on high-capacity magazines."" The ""assault weapons"" ban would take a entire category of firearms away from law-abiding citizens, the very thing Clinton said she would not do, while the ""high capacity"" magazine ban would force law-abiding citizens to hand over their ""high capacity"" magazines to government officials or to otherwise destroy them.All the while, criminals would retain their firearms and ""high capacity"" magazines and would benefit from the fact that they would immediately have a firepower advantage over disarmed, law-abiding citizens.Clinton is also calling for an expansion of background checks so that federal law mirrors the background check laws that currently exist in California, Colorado, and Washington state. Not surprisingly, those three states are also the locations of some our nation's most recent high profile shootings and firearm-based terror attacks; that observation alone should eliminate any talk of emulating the gun controls that are already failing in those three states.And we cannot forget Clinton's plan to use the Supreme Court of the United States to revisit the District of Columbia v Heller (2008) ruling, thereby tweaking, if not eliminating, the court's reaffirmation of the individual right to keep and bear arms.Perhaps Donald Trump put it best in the third presidential debate when he summarized the danger a Clinton-appointed SCOTUS poses to gun rights, saying, ""I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I really don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

However, getting the base out seems to be the current name of the game in Florida as both of the candidates barrel down the homestretch. The key to Florida this year, it seems, it not the independent vote but rather getting out the vote.Trump spends the most time in Florida, where he has held rallies late in the election cycle in the Republican strongholds of Pensacola and Panama City Beach, both located in the state's panhandle region.On the same night Trump was in Panama City Beach in early August, Clinton was hosting her own rally at the opposite end of state in South Florida's solidly blue Miami at Miami Dade College's Kendall Campus with former Vice President Al Gore. Among the topics discussed at that rally was the hot-button issue of global warming, which tends to excite Democratic voters.Candidates ""Trying to Hold on to Their Base for Dear Life""Dr. Susan MacManus, a political science professor at Tampa's University of South Florida, tells Breitbart News that both campaigns recognize the importance their party's base will play in winning Florida.""They're trying to hold on to their base for dear life,"" she said. ""Each of them has elements of it that are soft in their opinions and are kind of up in the air whether they're going to vote at all or cross over and vote for the other side. So, uncertainties are at a record level this time out because of the high levels of distrust of both candidates. And the fact that they're not really hearing issue positions as much as they're just hearing name-calling and personal attacks.""As for who may ultimately win those undecideds, it remains to be seen.MacManus, also a political analyst for Tampa's ABC affiliate, referenced a focus group of undecideds the ABC station conducted during last Wednesday's presidential debate. The focus group's pre-debate commentary, she said, focused on a hope for ""civility,"" but that there was cynicism it would happen.""The undecideds at this point just don't feel like they get enough details on really big issues about how these candidates are going to do all these grand promises that they are making - how they are going to accomplish things,"" she said.The undecided participants in the focus group had mixed reactions she said, but added they tended to favor Trump on certain issues.""At the end of the evening, I would say half said that they would definitely vote and the other half said that they were apprehensive,"" she said.All Eyes on Hillsborough CountyMonday Trump held one of his largest rallies of the campaign in Tampa, the state's third most populous city, and that could prove to be important.An analysis of the election results from Florida's county-by-county returns suggests historically the state has remained consistent with a few small exceptions and one big exception, which is Hillsborough County, the home of Tampa.In the previous four presidential elections, as Hillsborough County voted, so went the country.Turnout in Hillsborough County has been consistent over the previous four election cycles. It has far outpaced national turnout with the county's 2012 turnout at 72.9 percent, 2008 turnout at 73.6 percent, 2004 turnout at 74.8 percent and its 2000 turnout at 74 percent.You have to go back to the 1996 Clinton-Dole race, a year in which national turnout was the lowest it had been since the 1920s to find it dipped down to 68.4 percent.Both candidates have spent time in the Tampa Bay area. However on Monday, Trump made his second appearance in last 60 days in Tampa.The Great UnknownsAs of August, the number of registered voters in Florida has jumped by 377,000. Nearly 60 percent of whom registered as a Republican.That's in part attributable to Trump's candidacy for president.""There's no doubt that the March 15 primary, which Trump won with 46 percent of the vote, drew a flurry of new members to the Republican Party,"" Jeremy Wallace of the Miami Herald's Tallahassee bureau wrote back in August. ""It added 154,000 between January and March. Democrats gained only 88,000 during the same period.However, the question remains that given tone of the campaign, will these same new voters turn out for the GOP nominee on Election Day.""You don't really know much about them other than they're leaning toward him right now,"" MacManus said.Clinton is having to deal with her own questions, which are if millennials will turn out for her on Election Day according to MacManus.""She's trying to hold on to millennials and he's trying to hold on to these new blue-collar non-college educated voters - so they are both trying to reach groups that they are both having trouble holding on to.""Another question mark has to do with the number registered voters that declined being affiliated with a political party. Those so-called ""no-party affiliation"" voters are now one-quarter of Florida's registered voters, which MacManus says makes it necessary get-out-the-vote efforts""That is something we have not had to deal with - that large a segment in any state, but including a swing state like Florida, having that high of a concentration of NPAs. And who are they? They are younger voters in general.""Polling AccuracyWith the exception of a few days here and there, Clinton has maintained a lead over Trump since the GOP convention back in July.In a lot of those polls, the leads have not been insurmountable for Trump. The race has remained within the margin of error. And there is a concern among pollsters of a turnout surprise that could be in the Republican nominee's favor.""There's an old rule of thumb - if every poll is in the right direction, you have to think that that is the direction, but you can have surprises if there are turnout surprises and there is also at least among some in the polling community a sense that the Trump support is a bit understated, even by the more educated people, they don't want to acknowledge to anyone that they're really - when they go into the polling booth they're going to vote their party and they're going to vote for him reluctantly, but they're still going to vote for him,"" MacManus said. ""And we just don't know what percent. I think the softness in the traditional support groups within each party and the closeness of the polls in some key swing states is what is making people a bit hesitant to proclaim with certainty that she is going to win.""Another reason MacManus argues the polls are deserving of some skepticism is the small sample sizes the outlets are using as a basis for their polling. She said it is likely each of the campaigns with their superior resources have internal polling that is much more accurate that what the media have been able to compile.There is a competing narrative in the polling in Florida -- the U.S. Senate race between Sen. Marco Rubio (R) and Rep. Patrick Murphy (D). Even with all the negatives Trump is said to have brought for Republicans running down ballot, Rubio has maintained a lead over Murphy since declaring his intentions to run for reelection.For now, there is a dissonance in what the future holds for Republicans across the ballot.Signs Point to Turnout Winning the DayKey evidence that get out the vote is a greater priority the independent vote is where each of the candidates and their surrogates are holding events.Over the past few days, former President Bill Clinton has been on a bus tour on his wife's campaign's behalf in north Florida that spans from Jacksonville to Pensacola. Along the way, his stops have been at African-American communities.While Hillary Clinton will struggle in the heavily GOP northern part of the state, turning out the black vote will be key. President Barack Obama won the black vote in Florida by a margin of 95-4 in 2012 over former Gov. Mitt Romney and 96-4 over Sen. John McCain in 2008.Trump's appearances in the state's panhandle reason suggest a similar strategy is at work. While winning the panhandle is a foregone conclusion for Republicans, Trump decision to hold rallies in Pensacola and Panama City Beach late in the election cycle show Trump's campaign sees turnout as a necessary part of the equation as well.""Campaigns are focusing on turnout, with Clinton's campaign probably doing a better job getting new voters signed up,"" Frank Orlando of St. Leo University's Polling Institute told Breitbart News. ""It remains to be seen whether her organizational superiority on the ground wins out on Election Day, but in any race, that advantage can't be undervalued.""As we enter the homestretch, Trump is barnstorming Florida with stops in Naples, St. Augustine, Tampa, Sanford and Tallahassee. Clinton has three events penciled in for Florida in the coming days, one in Coconut Creek today, and events in Lake Worth and Tampa on Wednesday.The push from both sides this late in the game tells us two things: 1) The state of Florida is still in play and 2) Securing the state's 29 electoral votes are essential to achieve the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House and 3) Independents are not as prized as they were in past elections.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorSIGN UP"	['Sanford', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Romney', 'McCain', 'Rubio', 'Obama']	[]

It also is the last month on the Christian calendar before beginning the new liturgical year on the first Sunday of Advent. Catholics in particular are encouraged to meditate during November on the ""eternal truths,"" namely death, judgment, heaven, hell and purgatory.The modern feast of Halloween--""All Hallows' Eve""--derives from the Christian commemoration of the evening before the Feast of All Saints, celebrated on November 1.Because of their belief in the resurrection of the body, since the first century Christians have placed special value on respect for the body after death.""In memory of the death, burial and resurrection of the Lord,"" the Instruction states, ""burial is above all the most fitting way to express faith and hope in the resurrection of the body.""""By burying the bodies of the faithful, the Church confirms her faith in the resurrection of the body, and intends to show the great dignity of the human body as an integral part of the human person whose body forms part of their identity,"" it says.With regard to cremation, the text states that the Church has no doctrinal objections to the practice, ""since cremation of the deceased's body does not affect his or her soul, nor does it prevent God, in his omnipotence, from raising up the deceased body to new life.""""The Church continues to prefer the practice of burying the bodies of the deceased,"" however, ""because this shows a greater esteem towards the deceased. Nevertheless, cremation is not prohibited, 'unless it was chosen for reasons contrary to Christian doctrine,'"" the text reads.Moreover, when, ""for legitimate motives,"" cremation of the body has been chosen, ""the ashes of the faithful must be laid to rest in a sacred place, that is, in a cemetery or, in certain cases, in a church or an area, which has been set aside for this purpose, and so dedicated by the competent ecclesial authority.""Follow Thomas D.

Brooks Patterson has said he intends to sue the federal government for resettling refugees in the county while failing to comply with the ""consultation clause"" of the Refugee Act of 1980 that requires the federal to government and the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement to consult with state and local government officials prior to the placement of refugees within their jurisdictions.The full resolution reads:RESOLUTION TO SECURE THE TOWNSHIPS OF OAKLAND COUNTY AND PROTECT THEIR RESIDENTS FROM THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMWHEREAS: Refugees are placed in Michigan through the Federal Refugee Resettlement Program, a federal taxpayer funded program that contracts with vendor agencies to coordinate placements and welfare benefits for refugee families coming into our country, andWHEREAS: State records show that federal vendors operating in Michigan have requested a total of at least 4060 refugees be settled into Michigan in FY 2016, andWHEREAS: President Barack Obama has called for the resettling of at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the United States this fiscal year, andWHEREAS: Federal vendors have, thus far this fiscal year, resettled more Syrian refugees in Michigan than any other state; Oakland County is a focus area for resettlement; and the arrival numbers are expected to surge dramatically given the federal vendors' preparations, andWHEREAS: The FBI and other homeland security agencies have testified before Congress that refugees from failed states such as Syria cannot be adequately vetted to ensure that they do not have terrorist ties because the necessary records do not exist, andWHEREAS: Intelligence officials have testified before Congress that terrorists are seeking to use the program to enter the United States, andWHEREAS: Federal immigration law requires that local governments be consulted prior to placement of refugees in their communities and that they be involved in defining their local capacity for refugee placements, andWHEREAS: Federal reports indicate that there continue to be major gaps in communication between federal vendors and local governments and schools prior to the placement of refugees, andWHEREAS: The Refugee Resettlement process creates significant unfunded financial burdens for receiving states, counties and local communities to provide public assistance to meet refugee needs for schools, law enforcement, housing and health care, etc., andWHEREAS: There is pending federal and state legislation to reform the Refugee Resettlement Program requiring federal vendors to operate with more transparency, to more fully involve local governments in placement decisions, and to report to the state police all situations which could be related to security risks or human trafficking events,NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Charter Township of Waterford will not actively participate in the Refugee Resettlement Program until the Program has been significantly reformed, and until it has been demonstrated that the Townships of Oakland County have the capacity to absorb refugees without diverting funds from needy residents or exposing their residents to unwarranted security risks.AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies of this resolution be provided to all elected county, state and federal officials representing the Charter Township of Waterford.""The resolution, which has been pushed by the Oakland County Association of Township Supervisors, states that the federal Refugee Resettlement Program creates significant financial burdens for communities to meet the needs of the refugees, WWJ, the local CBS television affiliate in Detroit, reported.""We've got so many people who need jobs in Waterford, what are you gonna do with the refugees that come in here? You're gonna feed them, you're gonna clothe them, you're gonna house them.

At a July 2015 campaign stop in Iowa, she supported tax incentives and said: ""We need to continue the production tax credits."" Previously, she claimed that she wants to make the production tax credits (PTC) for wind and solar permanent. (Note: without the PTC, even the wind industry acknowledges it won't ""be able to continue."") She frequently says: ""I want more wind, more solar, more advanced biofuels, more energy efficiency."" Remember, her party platform includes: ""We are committed to getting 50 percent of our electricity from clean energy sources within a decade."" And: ""We believe America must be running entirely on clean energy by mid-century.""So, if your area hasn't been faced with the construction of wind turbines, you can expect that it will be. The good news is the more wind turbines spring up, the more opposition they receive--and, therefore, the more tools there are available to help break the next wind project.Rather than trying to figure out what to do on your own, John Droz, Jr., a North Carolina-based physicist and citizen advocate who has worked with about 100 communities, encourages citizens who want to protect their community from the threat of a proposed wind project to maximize the resources that are available to them.Kevon Martis, who, as the volunteer director of the Interstate Informed Citizens Coalition, has helped protect citizens in 7 states, told me: ""Nothing makes it harder for a wind developer in one community than if the neighboring community already has an operating wind plant. Once they can see the actual impacts of turning entire townships into 50 story tall power plants, they can no longer be led down the primrose path by wind companies and their agents.""Martis' equitable wind zoning advocacy has been extremely effective. In his home state of Michigan, wind has been on the ballot at the Township level 11 times since 2009 and has never won.Two communities in Vermont have industrial wind on the ballot on November 8 and it is playing a big role in the state's gubernatorial race where many Democrats are pledging to vote for the Republican candidate, who opposes more wind energy development. There, the foreign developer is essentially offering a bribe to the voters to approve the project.Droz agrees that zoning is important--as are regulations. He believes that since an industrial wind project is something you may have to live with for more than 20 years, it seems wise to carefully, objectively, and thoughtfully investigate the matter ahead of time. Droz says: ""In most circumstances, your first line of defense is a well-written, protective set of wind-energy regulations that focus on protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the community. They can be a stand-alone law, or part of a more comprehensive zoning document.""Mary Kay Barton, a citizen activist from New York State, began writing about the industrial wind issue more than a dozen years ago when her home area in Western New York State was targeted by industrial wind developers. Wyoming County was slated to have more than 2,000 industrial wind turbines strewn throughout its 16 Townships. So far, the massive projects have been limited by the outrage of residents to the current 308 turbines in 5 rural districts. Barton told me: ""We wouldn't even be talking about industrial wind if cronyism at the top wasn't enabling the consumer fraud of industrial wind to exist with countless subsidies, incentives and renewable mandates.""Through his free citizen advocacy service, Alliance for Wise Energy Decisions, Droz tries to make it easier for communities to succeed when dealing with industrial wind energy by learning lessons from some of the other 250 communities that have had to deal with it.At WiseEnergy.org, Droz has a wealth of information available including a model wind energy law that is derived from existing effective ordinances plus inputs from numerous independent experts. He advocates a wind energy law that contains carefully crafted conditions about these five elements:Droz, Martis, and Barton are just three of the many citizen advocates that have had to become experts on the adverse impacts of wind energy. Because of their experiences, many are willing to help those who are just now being faced with the threat.Because I've frequently written on wind energy and the favorable tax and regulatory treatment it receives, I often have people reaching out to me for help--but I am not the expert, just the messenger. These folks are dealing with it day in and day out.If the threat of industrial wind energy development isn't a problem for you now, save this information, as it likely would be under a Hillary Clinton presidency.""There was a time when the environmental movement opposed noise pollution, fought industrial blight, and supported 'little guys' whose quality of life was threatened by 'corporate greed,'"" writes Martis. ""But that was a long time ago, before wind energy.""The author of Energy Freedom, Marita Noon serves as the executive director for Energy Makes America Great Inc., and the companion educational organization, the Citizens' Alliance for Responsible Energy (CARE).

""The cases we have documented seem to indicate that some have done just that. Turkey's government should reinstate these crucial safeguards now.""In one case, a police officer was overheard telling a detainee that because of the state of emergency, ""nobody will care if I kill you.""""I will just say I shot you while you tried to run away,"" the police officer said.According to the lawyer of another prisoner, police officers warned his client that he would not survive the next month and that they would rape him with a baton.After the coup, the emergency decrees extended detention without judicial review from four to 30 days, meaning that even innocent citizens can be incarcerated for a month without any need for proof of wrongdoing. For the first five days, detainees are not allowed to be contacted and in many cases are not given a choice of lawyer or denied a lawyer altogether.The report cited the Union of Turkish Bar Associations as saying that more than 200 lawyers have been detained for suspected involvement in the coup.In a statement to a prosecutor, one detainee recounted how he was subjected to severe beatings.""The police chief who detained me ... began to slap me in the face and eyes,"" the detainee said. ""They beat me on the soles of my feet, on my stomach, then squeezed my testicles, saying things like they'd castrate me.""President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's crackdown has also made Turkish prisons particularly unsafe.In the aftermath of the coup, Amnesty International reported that those incarcerated were subjected to torture, abuse and rape in Turkish prisons. Andrew Gardner, who worked on the organization's report, told DW at the time that Turkey was steeped in a climate of ""great fear"" that was affecting everyone, including human rights organizations, journalists and lawyers.SIGN UP"	[]	[]
