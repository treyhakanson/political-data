In return, the prime minister said he would ""gladly"" address the PA's headquarters in Ramallah.In a Sunday editorial, the Saudi Gazette suggested that the Palestinians ""should not be too quick to dismiss the invitation,"" adding that it was ""reminiscent of the one issued by former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to visit Israel -- and the rest is history.""""Netanyahu's gesture was quickly rejected by the Palestinians as a 'new gimmick,'"" the Saudi newspaper editorial said.The paper credited the invite as paving the way to the Camp David Accords and the signing of a peace treaty, demonstrating ""that negotiations with Israel were possible and that progress could be made through sustained efforts at communication and cooperation.""Prior to that invitation, the paper wrote, Israel and Egypt were ""mortal enemies, having fought three wars.""It also noted former president Bill Clinton's 1998 trip to Ramallah to address the Palestine National Council, which led to both the recognition of Israel's right to exist as well as a unanimous vote to remove clauses in the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction.""Despite these two examples of how official visits can bend the arc of history, the Palestinians automatically rejected Netanyahu's invite to Abbas,"" the editorial noted, adding that ""it is possible that the aim of the invitation was an attempt by Netanyahu to isolate UN attempts to restart and impose a peace process between Israel and the Palestinians.""On a more negative note, the paper said Netanyahu ""rejects a settlement freeze, will not uproot settlements, rejects the 1967 borders as the basis for talks and rejects any division of Jerusalem.""Saudi Arabia does not formally recognize Israel and maintains no diplomatic ties with the country.In 2002, the kingdom proposed the Arab Peace Initiative, which calls for Israel to return to its 1967 borders in return for full relations with the Arab world.SIGN UP"	['Israel']	[]

That was partly because the moderator, NBC News' Lester Holt, turned in one of the most biased performances in the history of presidential debates. But it was also because Trump failed to talk about many of his strongest issues, and he failed to bring up some of Hillary Clinton's weaknesses when he had the chance.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHere are five key words that Trump forgot to say.1. ""Benghazi."" Trump never brought up Clinton's most damning, and emotive, failure as commander-in-chief. Lester Holt certainly wasn't going to raise the issue, but Clinton left him an opening when she said that he ""lacks the temperament to be commander-in-chief."" Instead of reminding voters that Clinton not only abandoned Americans in the middle of a terror attack, but lied about it afterwards, Trump talked about nuclear weapons and the amount of money America spends in NATO.2. ""Foundation."" When Lester Holt went at Trump over his tax returns, Trump talked about Clinton's deleted emails. But he failed to bring up the Clinton Foundation and its pay-to-play politics, which is the reason Clinton hid her emails in the first place. As a result, when Clinton attacked Trump for possible conflicts of interest -- he failed to point out that she mastered the concept, collecting millions in effective bribes as she and her husband collected cash from cronies and foreign governments.3. ""Wall."" Where was Trump's wall, or any hint of the immigration policy that helped him soar to the top of the presidential primary? True, the one time Trump tried to talk about immigration Holt diverted him to a conversation about Barack Obama's birth certificate. But that is no excuse. Clinton's amnesty-for-everyone policy is an open goal, especially given the recent spate of terror attacks carried out by Muslim immigrants, some with ties to Islamic extremist groups. Trump failed to take the shot.4. ""FBI."" Trump briefly mentioned Clinton's emails, but what is more important is the cover-up. She is the first presidential nominee of a major party to be investigated by the FBI, and as more information emerges, it is clear the FBI did everything it could to avoid prosecuting her despite the evidence. That is a preview of how a Clinton presidency would work again, with one law for the Clintons and another for everybody else. The system is rigged, and Trump needs to say that more specifically.5. ""Growth."" Trump never mentioned economic growth, which is the heart of his own economic policy, and the essence of what Republicans offer to voters, rather than the Democrats' policies of redistribution. The only times the word ""growth"" was mentioned was by the moderator -- erroneously praising Obama's record -- and Clinton: ""we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth""; ""Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America."" He let her own that issue Monday.Update: Note, too, that Trump did not mention ""radical Islamic terror."" He did mention terror, and he did mention Muslims -- in the context of explaining that he did not allow discrimination against Muslims at his golf club. But it seems an oversight, at the very least, for Trump to fail to mention ""radical Islamic terror"" when he has basically campaigned for months on Clinton's avoidance of those words. Especially given the frightening events of the past several weeks, that was a missed opportunity.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

And his press corps peers are pleased: Politico's Hadas Gold actually claimed: ""Lester Holt stays out of the way.""In reality, however, Holt was even worse than CNN's Candy Crowley, who famously fact-checked Mitt Romney (incorrectly) in the second presidential debate in 2012. Crowley only intervened once, while Holt interjected five times to ""correct"" Trump, often with false information. The most egregious example was when Holt claimed that New York's ""stop-and-frisk"" policy had been declared unconstitutional. Trump pushed back, correctly noting that the courts had never settled the issue because New York's new mayor, Bill de Blasio, had dropped the policy despite ample evidence that it had slashed crime in the city.Many of Holt's questions for Trump were straight out of the Clinton campaign's talking points, setting up the Democratic nominee for a well-rehearsed ambush. He asked Trump about his tax returns and the Birther theory, and even cast Trump's past criticism of Clinton as sexist. Holt never asked Clinton about her emails, about the Benghazi terror attack, or about the Clinton Foundation. He also pressed Trump on his statements about the Iraq War, never asking Clinton about her actual vote.Gold notes that Holt never asked Trump about his immigration policies, either. But that was because when Trump tried to turn the conversation towards immigration, Hold turned it back to Barack Obama's birth certificate:TRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.HOLT: I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...Moreover, as one observer noted, while Trump faced six follow-up questions, Clinton faced none. It is true that Holt ""stayed out of the way"" -- out of Clinton's way. But Holt did his best to make himself an obstacle between Donald Trump and the presidency. He undermined his credibility as a newsman, but earned a place in journalism's left-wing elite.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

The only question is whether those later debates will affect early voting.There are five basic reasons Trump will win the second and third debates.1. Expectations. The candidate that beats expectations by the widest margin wins the debate. As I explained in previewing the first debate, Trump originally had far lower expectations. But Clinton's health problems, which theoretically should have made the debate more difficult for her to endure, helped her by lowering expectations to her benefit: all she had to do was to stand up straight for 90 minutes and she would win. Now that she has won Round 1, Trump is the underdog for the next two.2. Moderators. Lester Holt was terrible -- more biased against Trump than CNN's Candy Crowley was against Romney in 2012. (Crowley intervened to save the Democrat once; Holt did so at least five times.) Holt will face well-deserved criticism from the right, which will serve as a warning to the remaining moderators. Moreover, no one else is as inexperienced as Holt. The second debate will feature Martha Raddatz and Anderson Cooper -- both on the left, but with experience asking Hillary Clinton about issues Holt ignored, like Clinton's e-mail scandal. The final debate will feature Fox News' Chris Wallace, who is typically fair. CBS News' Elaine Quijano, who will moderate the vice-presidential debate on Oct. 4 in FarmVille, VA , is new to debates, but is a straight shooter who will leave the candidates alone. (Full disclosure: she went to my high school.)3. Town hall format. Trump is simply better than Clinton at facing real, live voters. While Clinton's campaign has carefully curated her interactions with the public, Trump has been mixing it up with rough crowds for more than a year. Moreover, it is clear from the first debate that Clinton is focused on attacking Trump, while he focuses on the bigger picture (when he is not defending himself). The town hall format will allow him to ""go high when they go low,"" to paraphrase Michelle Obama.4. Las Vegas. Trump has home field advantage in the final debate. Arguably, his best debate of the Republican primary was in Las Vegas, a city that is a second home to the Trump family. No one knows a Fight Night like the Donald: he will come out aggressively, regardless of where he stands in the polls by then. This will not be a repeat of Mitt Romney's wilt-to-the-finish.5. Bonus for improvement. He may not have won the first debate, but Trump removed the risk that he would implode. And as he sharpens his performance over the next two debates, Trump will enjoy an additional benefit: voters will see him improve in real time, providing a demonstration of how quickly he would learn to do his job in the White House.Provided he combines his new, calm demeanor with a sharper focus on his best issues, like immigration, Trump will finish on top.Joel B.

7	7	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/27/an-exciting-debate-maybe-next-time/	An Exciting Debate? Maybe Next Time	"Lester Holt needs to be fact checked.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHe introduced the first presidential debate by saying it was sponsored by the ""non-partisan"" Commission on Presidential Debates.The Commission is bipartisan.The Commission is composed entirely of establishment Republican and Democratic former party officers. No one on the commission represents the plurality of American voters -- and the majority of new voters -- who are independents, let alone the other parties.It was a mediocre debate, with Hillary Clinton giving a non-stop smug, toothy, smile, the kind of thing that lost a debate for an eye-rolling Al Gore, and Donald Trump held in check as he went into the weeds, defending himself on boring points about his personal business life, and probably angering Ann Coulter by failing to mention his signature issue of illegal immigration and unvetted immigrants. It would have been much more interesting with Governor Gary Johnson -- or anyone else -- to challenge them both.Trump left a lot of money on the table, frittering away his time trying to explain why he hadn't released his tax returns, and allowing Clinton to place him in the unique position of being lectured by the queen of mendacity on how he must be hiding something.Clinton meanwhile produced the kind of bumperstickers and sound bites like ""Trumped Up Trickle Down"" that motivate her base of low information voters, who won't be prodded by a pro-Hillary media to wonder how Reagan's ""trickle down"" economics from the 1980s could cause an economic crisis in 2008, after the Clintons were in the White House for eight years in the 1990s.Too much of the debate consisted of Hillary telling people to go read her website.For example, Hillary insisted that unlike Trump, she has a plan to defeat ISIS -- which we can read on her website. Not having read her website, this debate told me nothing.Perhaps her plan to defeat ISIS consists of sending classified emails from her unsecured private server listing ISIS leaders and naming them as CIA assets or double agents so they kill each other. Trump often failed to mention Hillary's criminal recklessness with classified documents.As University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato observed in post debate analysis: ""During a discussion on cybersecurity, Trump failed to bring up Clinton's use of private emails as a potential cybersecurity issue."" That was the equivalent of ""missing the biggest, easiest softball lobbed right down the heart of the plate,"" as our Twitter pal @EsotericCD put it.""For the past few days everywhere I've gone in the DC metropolitan area, Hillary supporters have been depressed.Last Saturday, at the Arlington Gay and Lesbian Association picnic in Crystal City, Virginia, the one policy wonk in the group, a tax policy journalist, decided to eat the delicious BBQ provided (from the local Rocklands franchise) sitting across from me, because I was wearing a Johnson-Weld shirt. He pitched me every Clinton talking point (""the economy is doing so great - stocks are up and people have jobs!"") He also expressed fear that Trump would be elected.The morning before the debate, at the gay-owned gym Vida, a local TV reporter told me ""Trump is doing really well. Hillary is doing well with millennials -- but millennials who are actually registered to vote lean more to Trump.""When I pointed out to him that in a recent Nate Silver/538 post about DC Trump was up to 23 percent (Republican registration is only 7 percent of DC voters, and Romney only got 6 percent of the vote in DC) so that must include African Americans (DC being 49 percent black) he responded: ""A lot of blacks like Trump, because they hate illegal immigrants and think he will be good for the economy."" I said ""maybe they just don't like the Clintons,"" and he expressed a somewhat ""illiberal"" thought that, ""They are mad because of (Bill) Clinton's welfare reform.""I visited two leftist debate parties, and watched the debate at one co-sponsored by the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, the Latino Victory Fund, and the Environmental Defense Fund. Congressman Mark Tanaka and Veep wannabe Julian Castro tried to warm up the crowd on a bad sound system. A light sprinkling of press including the gay paper The Washington Blade and an Argentinian reporter interviewed the 150 half Latin, half white (very few blacks or Asians) crowd. They were largely cheered by Hillary's performance, as were the presenters on MSNBC.Earlier in the evening I attended another debate party whose guest of honor was Obama ghost writer and unconvicted terrorist Bill Ayers, who was launching a new book at DC's socialist bookstore Busboys and Poets.His first question, after his book talk and before the debate began, was from a septuagenarian communist who asked why Ayers had given up on revolutionary violence (Ayers' website features a red star logo). After an evasive answer Ayers returned to the topic later when answering a question from a Venezuelan immigrant with Ayers telling the audience that leftist factions here need to follow their Venezuelan brothers by learning how to get together to take power.This debate may not much effect which faction will be taking power here this November.The results of Lee Carter of Maslansky & Partners ""dial"" polling of group of voters fits with what I think is true of voters generally - this debate mainly provided confirmation bias, where Hillary and Trump supporters each saw what they wanted and were confirmed in what they already believed.A small number may have been driven to Jill Stein or Gary Johnson by Hillary's smugness or Trump's lack of debate preparation. As Larry Sabato summed it up in his release in the wee hours of the morning: ""This debate might not ultimately make much difference, but if it re-energizes Democrats after weeks of sagging enthusiasm, that will be a victory for her campaign. If it does not, she might be in quite a bit of trouble.""SIGN UP"	['Romney', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Castro', 'Obama']	['gay']

Tonight, Hillary Clinton made it clearer than ever that if elected President, our future will continue on the same path that is hurting millions of Americans.If Clinton is elected, we know that the havoc Obamacare is wreaking on American families, on small businesses, and on our healthcare system will continue. We know that President Obama's relentless efforts to crush the oil and gas industry and to wage war on coal will continue. We know that the Obama administration's willful blindness to radical Islamic terrorism and the influx of unvetted refugees from nations infiltrated by terrorists will continue. We know that President Obama's lawless executive amnesty will continue and even expand.If Clinton is elected, we know that a liberal justice will be named to fill Scalia's seat and we will lose the Supreme Court for a generation. With that, we know for a certainty that our right to keep and bear arms, our religious liberty and federalism are in danger.Tonight we received insight into what a Hillary Clinton presidency would look like for Americans. We know that her policies would kill jobs, reduce wages, and continue the downward spiral our country has endured under President Obama.Tonight, Donald Trump had his strongest debate performance of the election cycle. He drew strong contrasts with Hillary on taxes, regulations, law and order, and the disastrous Iran deal.Rather than Hillary's America, we need to take a different path. A path that would begin to restore our country from the damage it has suffered the last eight years. We need to unite to defend freedom and restore the Constitution. And Hillary Clinton made absolutely clear tonight she would not do so.It's interesting that none of the issues Cruz mentions in the first part of his post were actually discussed in depth during the first debate, and most weren't mentioned at all: ObamaCare; Obama's war on oil, gas, and coal; Syrian refugees; Obama's executive amnesty; Supreme Court justices; protecting the Second Amendment; religious liberty; or federalism.Trump touched on the job-killing, wage-suppressing effects of statist policies, but there's a lot more to be said about the absurdity of Clinton's plan to encourage private-sector job creation by taking more money away from the private sector.Perhaps Cruz was using his congratulatory message to supply Trump with some ammunition for the second debate. After the first one, Trump should have no illusions that mainstream media moderators will bring up any of these issues on their own.Tonight, a clear contrast was drawn between the two nominees.

If Clinton is elected, we know that a liberal justice will be named to fill Scalia's seat and we will lose the Supreme Court for a generation. With that, we know for a certainty that our right to keep and bear arms, our religious liberty and federalism are in danger.
Tonight we received insight into what a Hillary Clinton presidency would look like for Americans. We know that her policies would kill jobs, reduce wages, and continue the downward spiral our country has endured under President Obama.
Tonight, Donald Trump had his strongest debate performance of the election cycle. He drew strong contrasts with Hillary on taxes, regulations, law and order, and the disastrous Iran deal.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);Rather than Hillary's America, we need to take a different path. A path that would begin to restore our country from the damage it has suffered the last eight years. We need to unite to defend freedom and restore the Constitution. And Hillary Clinton made absolutely clear tonight she would not do so.SIGN UP"	['Cruz', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	['creation', 'healthcare']

Clinton's Director of Communications Jennifer Palmieri explained after the debate in an interview with Breitbart News. ""We're not banking on a change in the polls.""But Palmieri says she was genuinely pleased with Clinton's night, suggesting that she may have sparked some interest from undecided voters.""It's early. I'm pleased with what undecided voters saw,"" she added. When asked if she thinks Clinton appeared likable, she replied, ""I do.""However, Clinton advisers appeared more eager to pan Trump's performance, suggesting that he was unprepared, unhinged, and unpresidential.""She evidently gets under his skin,"" Palmeri said. ""He was baited even when we didn't try to bait.""David Plouffe, a political strategist and a member of Uber's board, suggested that the debate was increasingly ""bizarre"" as the night went on.""It was a bizarre debate, having been involved in preparing for these things, I mean to see someone kind of show up and not really be prepared kind of waning as the night went on,"" he said.He compared Trump's demeanor with that of President Obama's in the first debate with Mitt Romney.""Whether you like it or not, I learned in the first debate in 2012, mannerisms matter,"" he said, admitting that Obama didn't have a great debate that night.But he explained that Trump became more ""unhinged"" the longer the debate lasted.""I don't think they saw a president up there in Donald Trump, I thought they saw someone up there who was kind of very thin ... his annoyance showed through,"" he said.He argued that undecided women suburban voters were likely turned off by Trump's performance, voters he needed to pull himself ahead of Clinton in the election.""I don't think Trump added a single person to his column tonight,"" he said.He even ridiculed Trump's stamina, arguing that he ""clearly struggled"" in the debate as the night wore on.""If that had been a two hour debate, he would have been in deep trouble,"" Plouffe said.Sen.

""More irritant that anything else.""Iraqi security forces, backed by US-led coalition air power, are in the final weeks of preparing operations ahead of an assault to recapture Mosul, which the IS group seized in 2014 and which remains the jihadists' last main stronghold in Iraq.The Pentagon suspects that the IS group used mustard gas last week in a rocket launched against US soldiers at a base near Qayyarah, a northern town in Iraq considered strategic for retaking Mosul.The base is in the process of being transformed into a logistics hub to support the Mosul offensive.US officials estimate that Iraqi forces could be technically ready to launch the attack in early October.All US soldiers in Iraq who may be exposed to IS chemical arms have received training and the necessary protective equipment, Davis noted.""They have practiced it many, many times before they will ever get to a place like Qayyarah West where they could encounter it,"" he said.The United States also has provided more than 50,000 gas masks to the Iraqi forces, he said.""We want to make sure that the Iraqi security forces and the Peshmergas (Kurdish fighters) have the ability to detect this and to defend against it,"" he said.According to the Pentagon, the jihadists are making the mustard gas, and not taking it from the former stockpiles of the Iraqi or Syrian armies.SIGN UPWASHINGTON (AFP) -  "	[]	[]

Nobody could possibly assume there would be a mass execution,"" Maistrenko says in slow, hushed tones.Her father had been drafted into the Soviet army and she lived with her mother in her grandparents' apartment.Her grandfather Meer decided that the family should follow the Nazis' orders and led the death march to Babi Yar with his old cart packed with belongings in hand.Maistrenko non-Jewish grandmother Tanya volunteered to accompany her granddaughter -- and eventually saved her life.Noise and horrible screams could be heard as the mournful procession approached the gravesite that was tightly-cordoned by Nazi soldiers -- after getting in, there was no way out.Perhaps already knowing their fate in advance, ""my mom and her sister still kept their mother going because she had sore legs,"" Maistrenko says.""But my granny, she held me firmly in her arms and did not let go,"" Maistrenko told AFP next to the Babi Yar Menorah, a sacred Jewish candelabrum that was installed at the site of executions.- 'Don't look back'-""At some point, we found ourselves separated from the rest of the family.

14	14	http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/09/27/congress-looks-override-obama-veto-911-bill/	Congress Looks to Override Obama Veto of 9/11 Bill	"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is poised to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia for the kingdom's alleged backing of the terrorists who carried out the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe showdown is scheduled for Wednesday. Proponents of the legislation say they have enough votes for what would be a first: During his nearly two full terms in office, Obama has vetoed nine bills. None has been overridden.While there is broad and bipartisan support for bucking the president, the bill's opponents also are pushing hard to keep the measure from being enacted. They're warning the US will become vulnerable to retaliatory litigation in foreign courts that could put American troops in legal jeopardy.Here's a look at the key issues surrounding the bill, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as the veto override vote nears:What would the legislation do?The legislation, known as JASTA, gives victims' families the right to sue in US courts for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks that killed thousands in New York, the Washington, DC, area and Pennsylvania. Under the terms of the bill, courts would be permitted to waive a claim of foreign sovereign immunity when an act of terrorism occurs inside US borders. Saudi Arabia has objected vehemently to the bill.Why did Obama veto the bill?In his veto message issued on Friday, Obama said the bill would disrupt longstanding international principles on sovereign immunity and could create complications with even the closest allies of the United States.Foreign governments would be able to act ""reciprocally"" and allow their courts to exercise jurisdiction over the United States and its employees for allegedly causing injuries overseas through American support to third parties, according to Obama. As examples, Obama cited actions taken overseas by US-backed armed militias, the improper use of US military equipment, and abuses committed by US-trained police units.The bill's proponents have disputed Obama's rationale as ""unconvincing and unsupportable,"" saying the measure is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on US soil.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that the Senate would vote Wednesday on the president's veto.What's the concern for American troops and secrets?Rep. Mac Thornberry, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, said that even if none of the potential lawsuits against the United States succeeded, ""the risks of discovery or trial in foreign courts, including the questioning of government employees under oath, will disclose sensitive information and subject Americans to legal jeopardy of various kinds.""Thornberry is opposed to the bill and is urging his colleagues not to override Obama's veto.But attorneys for the 9/11 families said US military personnel are not at risk of lawsuits. Should a foreign government enact a law that allows a claim against American service members, that nation would not be reciprocating but engaging in a ""transparent and unjustifiable act of aggression"" that the US should respond to, they said.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, said Monday he is inclined to vote to override and said it looks as though there are enough votes in the House to overturn the president's decision. The House would act after the Senate votes.Is there heightened tension with a key Middle East ally?
An override of Obama's veto is stoking apprehension about undermining a longstanding yet strained relationship with Saudi Arabia, a critical US ally in the Middle East. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir had previously warned lawmakers they were on a path to turning ""the world for international law into the law of the jungle.""Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, last week advised his congressional colleagues against alienating Saudi Arabia at a time when the US needs the kingdom's support to defeat Islamic State militants. ""If you want to lose Saudi Arabia as an ally, be careful what you wish for,"" said Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""They're the heart and soul of the Islamic world.""How many votes are needed to override a veto?A two-thirds majority of lawmakers present and voting is required in the House and Senate to override a veto.Obama has vetoed the fewest bills -- just nine -- since President Warren G. Harding was in office more than 90 years ago, according to a web page maintained by the offices of the House clerk and historian. Harding served just two years as president before dying of a heart attack in 1923.By comparison, President Bill Clinton vetoed 37 bills and George W. Bush vetoed a dozen. Lyndon Johnson is the last president to never have a veto overridden.SIGN UP"	['Obama', 'Clinton', 'McConnell', 'Warren']	[]

The Obama administration alleges that Palantir discriminated against Asians. But it has to admit that Palantir, in fact, hired many Asians -- 11 out of 25 software engineers, for example. The government does not even bother to claim that Palantir deliberately excluded Asians. Rather, it argues that since only 44% of Palantir's software engineers are Asian, but 85% of the applicant pool was Asian, Palantir must, statistically, have discriminated against Asians.In other words: almost all of the software engineers at Palantir have to be Asian, or else it is guilty of ""racial discrimination."" Apparently left-wing concern for ""diversity"" in the workplace is a flexible concept, based on political expediency.(It is notoriously difficult for anyone, Asian or otherwise, to be hired by Palantir, which deals with very sensitive and advanced intelligence-oriented projects -- a fact that is well-known in the tech, defense, and public policy communities.)The lawsuit is obvious revenge for Thiel's support of Trump. In his speech at the Republican National Convention in July, Thiel blasted the government for its technological backwardness: ""[T]oday our government is broken ... it would be kind to say the government's software works poorly, because much of the time it doesn't even work at all.""Thiel's government clients clearly did not take kindly to that -- and wanted to send a message to other potential Trump fans in the business and tech communities.One expert interviewed by the San Jose Mercury News was highly skeptical of the lawsuit's merits:""This is unusual,"" said Buck Gee, a former Cisco executive who studies Asian diversity in Silicon Valley, said of the accusations against Palantir. ""If it's true, it would be an anomaly.""But Gee said Asian employees are less likely to be promoted once they are hired. At Facebook, for example, just 21 percent of the company's senior leadership staff is Asian.As for the Palantir lawsuit, Gee is skeptical about the discrimination claims. The complaint leaves out key information, he said, such as what percentage of the company's overall workforce is Asian. And the Labor Department didn't explain how it determined which rejected applicants were qualified for the engineering jobs in question.The Department of Labor hopes to weaponize the Supreme Court's disastrous ruling last year in Texas Housing on so-called ""disparate impact"" discrimination to bully Thiel and others. Thiel, who was recently revealed as the main force behind a years-long battle against Gawker, probably has the guts to fight back. But others will not.Joel B.

They are gone. And Hillary, I'd just ask you this: you've been doing this for 30 years, why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years you've been doing it and now you are just starting to think of solutions... I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs.Clinton replied, ""Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit... I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again--""Trump interjected, ""He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal in this country--""Clinton continued, ""--incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing went up in the 1990s if we're actually going to look at the facts.""""Excuse me,"" Trump later said. ""Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened.""Remarkably, Clinton chose to respond by defending NAFTA: ""Well, that's your opinion,"" Clinton said.Clinton's decision to defend her husband's trade policies of the 1990s is interesting given the fact that many voters in Clinton's own party believe these trade policies have not benefited American workers.According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, since the ratification of NAFTA, Pennsylvania lost 36% of its manufacturing jobs, Ohio lost 34% of its manufacturing jobs, Michigan lost more than a quarter of its manufacturing jobs, and Maine lost 39% of its manufacturing jobs.A recent POLITICO Pro-Harvard poll found that by a five-to-one margin, Americans believe that trade policies with other countries have lost American jobs  -- 65% believe our trade policies have lost U.S. jobs versus only 13% who believe our trade policies have created U.S. jobs. By a nearly four-to-one margin, Americans believe our trade policies have lowered rather than raised wages. Only 14% of Americans believe our trade policies have raised U.S. wages.As Clyde Prestowitz, former counselor to the Secretary of Commerce under President Reagan, has explained, much of the global trade agreements that have come to define our current trade policies began in the 1990s under the Clintons' auspices.In the 1990s, international trade morphed into the far broader and more complex phenomenon of globalization,"" Prestowitz wrote:In 1992, the United States, Mexico and Canada essentially extended the 1988 U.S.-Canadian Free Trade Agreement into the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA. ... The agreement was essentially for an economic union, looser than but similar to the EU arrangement. Then in 1993, President Clinton hosted the first meeting of the leaders of twenty-one nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), who committed to greater economic integration of their nations. Finally in 1994, the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations concluded by turning the GATT into the World Trade Organization (WTO).Prestowitz has described China's entrance into the WTO--negotiated by Bill Clinton--as one of ""America's dumbest deals ... [that] reduced American influence and power, and constrained its future wealth-creating ability.""""It really should have been called the World Globalization Organization,"" Prestowitz wrote, explaining that Bill Clinton's trade policies were motivated by his globalist ideology: ""[He] embraced the notion that globalization and Americanization are more or less the same thing and saw globalization as the way to make the Chinese more like us.""During the debate, Trump warned that if Hillary Clinton were elected president, she would continue to expand upon her husband's legacy on trade by approving the Trans Pacific Partnership. Trump said, ""NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere but certainly ever signed in this country and now you want to approve Trans Pacific Partnership.

They are gone. And Hillary, I'd just ask you this: you've been doing this for 30 years, why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years you've been doing it and now you are just starting to think of solutions... I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs.In 1992, the United States, Mexico and Canada essentially extended the 1988 U.S.-Canadian Free Trade Agreement into the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA. ... The agreement was essentially for an economic union, looser than but similar to the EU arrangement. Then in 1993, President Clinton hosted the first meeting of the leaders of twenty-one nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), who committed to greater economic integration of their nations. Finally in 1994, the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations concluded by turning the GATT into the World Trade Organization (WTO).SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By contrast, Hillary Clinton delivered a mush of platitudes that were likely aimed at the much smaller audience of guilty white liberals.Hillary Clinton's tepid response was designed to allow her to tiptoe a thin line to focus on the complaints of Black Lives Matter while not exactly coming right out and blaming the police. The result was a mess, with Clinton unable to effectively land any sort of punch against Trump.More importantly, Trump did not just tie the concept of law and order to protecting any single group, but to protecting all people -- especially African-Americans. This built on the unprecedented inroads that Trump has made with black voters in the last few weeks.Trump also hammered on the fact that Chicago has had 4000 murders since Barack Obama's presidency began and has had 3000 shootings this year alone. He suggested that law enforcement techniques like ""stop and frisk"" were effective in New York City when implemented by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and would be equally effective across the country in taking guns out of the hands of  bad guys.Clinton's response was to simply deny reality and say that Trump was painting an overly negative and ""dire"" picture of inner-city America. Hillary Clinton's argument is unlikely to go over well with the residents of inner-city America, or anybody who's paying any attention to what is going on in cities across America from Baltimore to Chicago to Los Angeles.After this initial volley, both Trump and Clinton settled down into minor scuffles on issues like community relations between police as well as not letting people on the ""no-fly list"" have guns. Compared to Trump's initial blockbuster response, it was weak tea. Trump's damage had already been done.While Americans are watching chaos in the streets of Charlotte North Carolina, Donald Trump's no-nonsense approach focus on two blunt words - law and order - brought clarity to the issue that Hillary Clinton's muddle of catchphrases about feelings and mental health could not.Trump concluded with a message that will likely resonate with many people in America's inner city: The politicians are able to talk one game around election time, but  have not delivered results.That's reality and reality is something Clinton could not deliver.SIGN UP"	['Black', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	['guns']

Those include:Secondly, regarding adding the no-fly list to background checks, Clinton failed to mention that our three most recent terror attackers-the NY bombing suspect, the Orlando terrorist, and San Bernardino terrorists-acquired their guns via background checks and none of them were on a terror watch list, so adding the watch list to checks would have done nothing.Lastly, Clinton has been pushing a ""gun epidemic"" for some time. In November 2015, Breitbart News reported that Clinton swelled the number of gun violence deaths by 66 percent. She did this by adding suicides and accidental gun deaths to homicides. This allows her to take the approximate 11,000 actual homicides that occur annually and expand them to 33,000 deaths by lumping in the approximately 22,000 suicides and 500 accidental deaths that occur each year.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

But he lived down to the worst expectations of conservatives, who routinely see Republican candidates treated unfairly by debate moderators.Again and again, Holt asked Trump tough questions that were straight from the Clinton campaign's talking points, and which were obvious set-ups for Clinton to attack (and for fact-checkers to pounce on whatever Trump asserted in his own defense).Here are the five worst examples.Tax returns. Holt never asked Clinton about her e-mail scandal, about Benghazi, or about the Clinton Foundation and its dubious dealings. But he did ask Trump about his tax returns, arguing -- not asking -- that there might be questionable information in them that the American public deserved to hear.Birther conspiracy theory. Holt never asked Clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her ""super-predator"" remarks as First Lady, or her explicit appeal to ""white Americans"" in her 2008 primary campaign against Obama. Yet he asked Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist.Stop-and-frisk. After an exchange between the candidates over the policy of ""stop-and-frisk,"" Holt interjected to bolster Clinton's point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in New York because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. Trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over.""A presidential look."" Towards the end of the debate, Holt asked Trump about what he meant by saying Hillary Clinton did not have ""a presidential look."" He did so after noting that Clinton had become ""the first woman"" to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting Trump up as a sexist. As Trump answered, Holt interrupted him, then gave Clinton a chance to respond with her talking points about Trump's past comments on women.Iraq War. The question of whether Trump supported the Iraq War or not has been widely debated. What is beyond doubt is that Hillary Clinton voted for it. Holt only represented one side of the debate about Trump, and never asked Clinton about her own vote.In addition, the audience repeatedly interjected -- almost always in Clinton's favor -- and Holt did not stop them, though it was against the rules. He only stopped the audience when there were cheers for Trump calling for Clinton's emails.Bow again, Lester Holt. You did your job.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Our 5,000 officers, underfunded and undermanned, are responsible for enforcing immigration laws in a nation of 320 million people. Our officers come into daily contact with many of the most dangerous people in the world - cartel members, gang members, weapons traffickers, murder suspects, drug dealers, suspects of violent assault - yet ICE Officers are unable to arrest or are forced to release many of the most dangerous back into U.S. communities due to unscrupulous political agendas and corrupt leaders. The unconstitutional executive orders of President Obama, embraced by Hillary Clinton, have forced our officers to violate their oaths to uphold the law and placed every person living in America at risk - including increased risk of terrorism. Our officers are prevented from enforcing the most basic immigration laws, including laws against illegal work, illegal entry, illegal overstay and also the public charge law.This first-ever endorsement was conducted by a vote of our membership, with Hillary Clinton receiving only 5 % of that vote.

Her radical plan would result in the loss of thousands of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and an uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S. borders.

The HORROR.10:20 p.m. EDT: Lester Holt bows to the Clinton campaign, and tries to ""fact-check"" Trump on his support for (or opposition to) the Iraq War.It happens thus: Holt introduces, matter-of-factly, the premise that Trump supported the Iraq War. Trump pushes back, calling it ""mainstream media nonsense."" Trump burns two minutes explaining how he did not support the war, citing Howard Stern and Sean Hannity.At the end, Holt repeats the allegation again anyway. This is what the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media wanted him to do.In one gesture, Holt proves everything that conservatives allege about mainstream media moderators, NBC News, and ""fact-checking.""10:07 p.m. EDT: The self-proclaimed fact-checkers join moderator Lester Holt and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for a real-time demonstration of how so-called ""fact-checking"" is really a guise for deliberate political attacks.
Step 1: Moderator asks setup question. In a segment on race relations, Holt asks Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory. He asks no similar questions about Clinton's record, leaving Trump himself to bring up such Clinton hits as ""superpredator."" Trump also notes that the Birther conspiracy theory started in the Clinton campaign.Step 2: Democrat pounces on setup question. Clinton goes to town on Trump's Birther past, denying her own. Trump counters, again, with examples of racism from Clinton's 2008 campaign. But then...Step 2a: Moderator interrupts Trump's response. Holt reminds Trump that the segment is about race relations. Just to reinforce the underlying charge of racism.Step 3: Fact-checker gives Trump a ""false."" PolitiFact tweets a link to an article from Sep. 16 claiming that neither Clinton nor her campaign had anything to do with the Birther conspiracy theory. Of course they did, as Clinton's campaign manager admitted. Trump points that out -- and perhaps that is effective, but the point is that the left's so-called ""fact-checking"" machine completes the cycle.
To review: Moderator sets up attack, Democrat attacks, fact-checker removes Republican's defense.9:58 p.m. EDT: Trump fact-checks Clinton when she claims crime is down in New York, including murder.Trump is right. Crime was down overall in New York last year, but murder, rape, and robbery were up, according to the Wall Street Journal.We don't need no fact-checkers...9:49 p.m. EDT: Trump fact-checks the moderator.
Holt: Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York...Trump: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.
Fact Wreck rating: Trump is 100% right, according to the New York Times and Holt's collusion with Clinton is becoming hard to ignore.9:47 p.m. EDT: The left's pressure on moderator Lester Holt seems to have worked, as he raises the question of Trump's tax returns (not yet disclosed) but says nothing about Clinton's missing emails, leaving that to Trump to raise on his own.FactCheck.org does not bother to fact-check Hillary Clinton's false rebuttal, which is that she made a ""mistake"" (which she originally claimed was a mistake of using only one phone, when she in fact had 13). Instead, the organization simply refers to a ""guide"" to Hillary's emails.9:25 p.m. EDT: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both refer viewers to fact-checking services on their campaign websites.The media fact-checkers are about to go out of business.9:22 p.m. EDT: Hillary Clinton fact-checks Donald Trump, after he says that she supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership before she opposed it.
Clinton: That is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated...Trump: ...You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you'd ever seen.""Clinton: No.
Actually, she did. CNN (!) counted 45 times Clinton pushed the deal.PolitiFact notes that Clinton did, indeed, flip-flop on the deal:
LIVE FACT-CHECK: Trump is right, Clinton flip-flopped on TPP https://t.co/howNkUisAE pic.twitter.com/V70SDG3MAY-- PolitiFact Live (@politifactlive) September 27, 2016
Was that necessary, though? Trump just pointed it out.9:18 p.m. EDT: Donald Trump fact-checks Hillary Clinton. She said: ""Donald thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese."" He denied it.He did, in fact, tweet in 2012 that the Chinese invented the concept of ""global warming"" for their own benefit. He later said he was joking.Candidates fact-checking each other. What a concept.9:16 p.m. EDT: FactCheck.org has two fact checks so far, both of Trump. And not because Hillary's been more truthful.Thus far, the 1st factual error in #debatenight is @HillaryClinton saying the US doesn't yet have ""equal pay for equal work."" Fact-checkers?-- Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) September 27, 20169:12 p.m. EDT: Alex Burns of the New York Times files the first fact check of the evening, complaining about Trump's claims about Ford moving jobs to Mexico. But Burns -- and, thus far, the rest of the fact-checkers -- missed the actual first false statement by any of the candidates.The whopper came from Clinton, who suggested that the U.S. does not yet have ""equal pay for equal work,"" something that has been a matter of law for decades. (The remaining inequality, such as it is, is largely due to factors such as career choice and time off for children.)8:58 p.m. EDT: FactCheck.org calls NBC News host Lester Holt a ""moderate."" It's just a typo, but why not?
Moderate Lester Holt says that hopefully it will be ""just the two of them tonight,"" and he will facilitate the discussion.-- FactCheck.org (@factcheckdotorg) September 27, 2016
Actually, Holt's political affiliation has been a part of the pre-debate controversy. Trump called Holt a Democrat; he is actually a registered Republican. (Fun fact: Fox News' Chris Wallace is apparently a registered Democrat.) According to political scientist Tim Groseclose, more than 90% of political journalists are registered Democrats, while some 7% identify as Republican.Ostensibly, ""fact-checking"" aims to help the public make more informed decisions, both by helping them see past the candidates' political spin, and by helping them see which candidates are more truthful. In practice, ""fact-checking"" is weighted against Republicans, largely because fact-checkers evaluate Republicans more than Democrats.When fact-checkers do scrutinize Democrats, the party of the left often enjoys the benefit of the doubt. For example, when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton first faced questions about whether she used her secret private email server to send or receive classified material, the Washington Post gave her a mere two Pinocchios (out of four) when she claimed she had not. For months, evidence mounted that Clinton had lied. Only when FBI Director James Comey said that Clinton had, indeed, exchanged classified material through her email server -- while declining to prosecute her for the same -- did the Post upgrade its rating from two to four Pinocchios.Conversely, fact-checkers often punish Republicans for statements that are factually correct. For example, Politifact rated as ""false"" a statement by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) claiming that President Barack Obama had promised to dismantle Iran's nuclear program. But Cotton's statement was, in fact, completely accurate.In the run-up to Monday's first presidential debate, Democrats and media pundits have urged moderator Lester Holt to fact-check Republican nominee Donald Trump during the debate. It is dubious advice, given the disastrous precedent of CNN's Candy Crowley, who erroneously fact-checked Republican Mitt Romney during the second debate in 2012. The pressure has another purpose, which is to cast Trump as more dishonest than Clinton.It is well past time to fact-check the fact-checkers.Check for regular updates during Monday's first presidential debate.Joel B.

Trump: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.

Clinton: That is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated...
Trump: ...You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you'd ever seen.""
Clinton: No.

Thus far, the 1st factual error in #debatenight is @HillaryClinton saying the US doesn't yet have ""equal pay for equal work."" Fact-checkers?

Moderate Lester Holt says that hopefully it will be ""just the two of them tonight,"" and he will facilitate the discussion.

Nearly three times that many, approximately 1,573, were stabbed or hacked to death.These facts are especially interesting when you consider that the Democrats emerged from the Sandy Hook Elementary attack with a plan to ban numerous rifles, politically categorized ""assault weapons,"" and certain shotguns as well. But these efforts are misplaced, at best, if the FBI's numbers are to be trusted.While Democrats are pushing an ""assault weapons"" ban that covers certain shotguns, more than three times as many Americans were killed via stabbing or hacking than from all types of rifles and shotguns combined. And nearly twice as many Americans were simply beaten to death with ""hands, fists, feet, etc."" than were shot and killed with rifles of any kind.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
