""Forty-eight percent of likely voters are inclined to vote yes on Proposition 66, according to the poll, up 13 percentage points from September.""But The Field Poll points out that opposition to simply reforming the death penalty via Prop 66 is also growing.

Mike Huckabee: Trump Will Win Because America’s Institutions ‘Have All Failed, and Miserably’	"LAFAYETTE HILLS, Pennsylvania -- Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a former rival of 2016 GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump turned ardent supporter post-primary, told Breitbart News exclusively he expects a major Trump victory over Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton on election day on Tuesday.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHuckabee said in an interview on the way to a pro-Trump Super PAC Great America PAC bus tour event he was speaking at here:I think Donald Trump is going to win and I think it's going to be a shocking kind of victory. I think he is the Chicago Cubs of the political season. And it was just a few weeks ago that the smug pundits on television were saying he can't win, that there was no path for him to win, and I can't wait to walk the halls of Fox on Tuesday night when I'm there and go up to some of the people who were so adamant about it, so elitist about it, and just say to them 'Gosh, I just got the results, and Trump won: What are we going to do about that?' So, no, I felt that way even when his numbers were at their lowest between the Democratic convention and the whole Hollywood Access thing. I just heard talking to real people out there across this country that the intensity of support for him, the disgust with the corruption that the Clintons have purveyed for so many years with impunity, it's got to come to an end.Huckabee has been battling the Clintons--both Bill and Hillary--since their days in Arkansas when he was elected first to the Lieutenant Governor's office then the governor's office in the wake of Bill Clinton's election to the White House in the 1992 presidential election. Hillary Clinton is facing her biggest scandals yet as the Clinton Foundation is under FBI investigation and the FBI has reopened the criminal investigation into her illicit home-brew email server that she set up in violation of State Department guidelines.Meanwhile, Huma Abedin, her longtime aide, comes under the spotlight as Abedin's now estranged husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner, is under federal grand jury investigation for allegedly sending lewd messages to underage girls--a grand jury probe that led to the reopening of the email investigation after the discovery of a shared Abedin-Weiner laptop with hundreds of thousands of emails related to the Clinton email investigation, including, reportedly, previously undisclosed messages. Asked about all of this crashing down on the Clintons now, Huckabee was not surprised:No surprises, other than just the sheer magnitude of it is a little bit stunning. When you have the Clintons shaking down foreign governments for hundreds of millions of dollars and enriching themselves to the tune of $150 million just in speaking fees--when it costs $100,000 to have a meeting with Bill Clinton and he'll speak to your group for $750,000--you go through all of these amazing ways in which favors from the government were sold, access to the government was sold to the highest bidder. How anybody thinks that any person associated with that should ever be near the White House is frankly beyond me.Huckabee's message to Trump supporters across the nation is to seize the moment and make sure to vote. Huckabee said:Don't be weary and well-doing. This is the time to go and vote. And don't let anything keep you from it. What I'm encouraged by is the Trump voters are very motivated voters. If it rains 16 inches on election day, they're still going to go vote because they feel that their country is on the line. I don't feel enthusiasm among Hillary voters. Quite frankly, I keep hearing about a great ground game she has, well she needs it because if she doesn't give people a sandwich, a shot of whiskey and a ride to the polls, there's nothing that's all that exciting for them.Huckabee added there is a clear enthusiasm gap that doesn't show up in the polls. Huckabee said:My gosh, when she does a rally, they got to pump oxygen into the room to keep people awake. It's a very different kind of level of support that you see. On her part, it's obligatory Democrats doing their party duty. For Trump, it's a movement and it crosses gender racial socio-geographic lines. It obliterates normal political divisions, something I don't the people sitting across the news desks in New York and Washington have yet to figure out. I'm absolutely convinced that they look at their poll numbers--and they look at each other--but they don't leave that little bubble and get out and talk to people serving food, standing on concrete floors and lifting heavy things all day. They don't listen to the people who have seen their homes foreclosed, their net worth destroyed, their pensions gone, and I'm telling you there's a mood out there people are not in a mood to say 'we've had a great eight years under Obama, let's give ourselves four to eight more under Hillary.'Huckabee also said that Trump's populism on the core issues of trade and immigration is how he beats the political class and the very institutions themselves as the entire establishment has aligned against him. He went on to say:Back in 2008, my message was 'there's a Washington to Wall Street axis of power.' They win, and the rest of us lose. That was my primary message then, Donald Trump has certainly had a lot more attention with it. The trade deals haven't helped the American worker. They've declined his wages. So has immigration. You mentioned the institutions--I'll tell you I think most Americans believe that all of the major institutions of finance, media, government, entertainment, have all failed and miserably. The people at the center of those institutions have all done handsomely well. But the people who are supposed to be served by those institutions have been decimated. And so where the wealth of the few have increased dramatically, just the ability to exist on the part of most people has declined miserably.With his prediction of a Trump victory--which seems more and more likely as the polls keep trending in his direction in the final days--Huckabee said that he is glad the Clintons will finally face justice for their actions.""It's not that I relish in their fall, but what I relish in is a country that has equal justice under the law, where some people don't get away with selling off this country and its assets, violating every code of national security and protection of documents,"" Huckabee said. ""When I see decorated Marines like Gen. Cartwright indicted and probably going to go to prison for doing a fraction of what Hillary did, it makes my blood boil. I'm thinking this is just unbelievably wrong. You know, a sailor takes a photo of a nuclear sub--and he's in prison right now. He didn't take it to give it to the Russians or the Chinese or the Iranians, it was just a stupid mistake on the part of a 20-year-old kid. We're seeing someone who is a Yale-educated lawyer, who has been in government--in and out of it--most of her life, who's supposed to be one of the smart people. And her careless and cavalier way with national security would have put anybody else in prison. For her to be revealed as a person with contempt for the working class people, Catholics, Evangelicals, gun owners, people across this country, it's just time that America say: 'You're never going to get near that White House.'""I think Donald Trump is going to win and I think it's going to be a shocking kind of victory.

Apparently Tanden thought if Hillary made this clim it would make her seem less stubborn and out of touch.The highly placed Democrat operative also insisted that if Hillary made the admission enough times in interviews she would ""eventually... sound like a human"" to voters.""I read what she said today.

Referring to Bill Clinton as ""wjc,"" Band wrote, ""Oddly, wjc does not have to sign such a document even though he is personally paid by 3 cgi sponsors, gets many expensive gifts from them, some that are at home etc.""Band continued, admitting that he ""could add 500 different examples"" of Bill Clinton's conflicts of interest.The aforementioned emails came during a increasingly contentious time for the Clinton foundation, ahead of a burgeoning power struggle between Band and Chelsea Clinton about the direction of the charity.The clash between Band and Chelsea Clinton was likely spurred by an internal review -- apparently requested by Chelsea -- of the Clinton Foundation which revealed even the charity's own employees gave it poor marks for effectiveness, rating it at a four or lower on a scale of 10.The audit revealed problems with Clinton Foundation IRS filings and conflicts of interest due to Hillary Clinton's role as Secretary of State. The audit said that ""Some interviewees reported conflicts of those raising funds or donors, some of whom may have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gifts.""""We recommend that the Foundation establish a gift acceptance policy and procedures to ensure that all donors are properly vetted and that no inappropriate quid pro quos are offered to donors in return for contributions,"" the audit read.Band had served as a top aide to President Bill Clinton in the nineties and assisted in creating the Clinton Global Initiative. Band is also a founding partner of Teneo, a global consulting firm -- with several connections to the Clintons -- that obtained approval from the State Department for a paid consulting arrangement between Bill Clinton and Band.Teneo is the same firm that paid Mrs. Clinton's longtime right-hand woman Huma Abedin while she worked as a senior adviser to Clinton at the State Department.A few months after Hillary Clinton took office in 2009, Abedin began communicating with Clinton Foundation donors, who were asking for favors from Clinton's State Department.While she was secretary of state, Hillary Clinton also handpicked Teneo co-founder and CEO Declan Kelly as her economic envoy to Northern Ireland.Chelsea Clinton had accused Band of abusing his power and ""hustling"" business for Teneo at CGI meetings.

""Hillary's plan would unleash violent cartels and brutal transnational gangs into US communities and cause countless preventable deaths.""Crane explains that the uncontrolled flood of record numbers of migrants into the country will be especially harmful on poor communities- including Hispanic and immigrant communities that will bear ""the economic brunt the illegal immigrant surge.""ICE officers on the front lines are witnessing a deluge of illegal immigration unlike anything we have seen before.

If she was for children she could have never went there with me as a 12-year-old girl,"" added Shelton.Watch video here:Fighting tears, Shelton reacted as this reporter played audio, unearthed in 2014, in which Clinton can be heard laughing at several points in the recording while discussing the case in which she got Taylor off the hook in a plea bargain.As part of the case, Clinton filed numerous affidavits attacking Shelton's credibility and family, even accusing the 12-year old of a tendency to ""seek out older men and to engage in fantasizing.""She also demanded that Shelton be put through a psychiatric examination, although the judge in the case reportedly denied Clinton's request.Clinton took these actions despite strongly implying in the audio - recorded as part of an interview with a local reporter that was never published - that she knew Taylor to be guilty.Shelton's current attorney, Candice Jackson, points out that some of Clinton's harsh tactics against the child rape victim would likely have been illegal under Arkansas's rape shield act, which was not in force at the time.During the Breitbart News interview, Shelton recounted the rape by Thomas Alfred Taylor and an underage male, which took place in Arkansas in 1975. The assault was particularly brutal, resulting in Shelton remaining in a coma and waking up with stitches on her private parts, she says.Shelton stated in the interview:I was going like a couple of blocks to go to church and these two guys stopped in a truck and started approaching me, which one was underage so they couldn't bring him into it. They said I was going with them. And I said, ""No I'm not."" And I tried to take off. And they jerked me off my bicycle and they put me in a truck and they were hitting me and I was screaming and crying that I didn't want to go.And I guess no one heard me. And we went on to a road where there was fields. And I'm not sure what road it was today. And by the time we got there, all of my clothes was ripped off of me and they raped me ... in the car.And they were hitting me and beating me so bad that parts of it I don't even remember. They threw me out of the truck into the field or the edge of the field and they were beating me. And I'm pretty sure they thought I was dead.Shelton says she remembers crawling, with blood on her body, to the porch of a nearby resident, and then she collapsed.And I started crawling and I crawled. And I found this house and I crawled up on the porch. And knocked on the door. And she answered the door and the porch light came on and I seen them coming back and at that point I went out and I don't remember anything until five days later after coming out of a coma in the hospital. ...I was totally beaten. I had blood all over me. ... I went into a coma because I had some pretty hard head issues where they threw me up against the door. Punching me and so forth. I just know that I had cuts and bruises all over me. I had stitches around my private part and I was told at that point by the doctor that there was a 99 percent chance that I could never have kids.While Shelton says she was in a coma for five days, the Washington Post found court documents showing that four days after the rape, an investigator filed a signed report stating that he had ""personally interviewed"" Shelton, whose name was removed from the report because she was a minor.Jackson, Shelton's attorney, responded, ""There are a lot of details in those documents that turn it to be questionable. For example, in the same document it says the victim's 'parents' reported this - yet Kathy was being raised by a single mom and her dad had been out of the picture for a long time. And I don't think four days/five days is a significant enough detail to call into question Kathy's veracity; it's the Washington Post doing all it can to question Kathy and defend Hillary.""Shelton reacts to Clinton audio: 'It makes me sick'The audio, archived at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, comes from a 1980s interview with Arkansas reporter Roy Reed intended for an Esquire magazine profile that was never published. It was unearthed in 2014 by the Washington Free Beacon.In the audio, Clinton says she took on Taylor's case as a favor to another attorney who wanted the rapist to be represented by a woman. ""A prosecutor called me years ago, said that he had a guy who was accused of rape, and the guy wanted a woman lawyer,"" Clinton can be heard saying. ""Would I do it as a favor to him?""Later, Clinton said she was picked by a judge to defend Taylor and that she was not happy with the assignment.As part of the case, Clinton filed numerous affidavits attacking Shelton's credibility and family, even accusing the twelve-year old of having a tendency to ""seek out older men and to engage in fantasizing."" She also demanded that Shelton be put through a psychiatric examination, although the judge in the case reportedly denied Clinton's request.""I have been informed that the complainant is emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and to engage in fantasizing,"" Clinton wrote in one affidavit without citing any evidence. ""I have also been informed that she has in the past made false accusations about persons, claiming they had attacked her body. Also that she exhibits an unusual stubbornness and temper when she does not get her way.""""I have also been told by an expert in child psychology that children in early adolescence tend to exaggerate or romanticize sexual experiences and that adolescents in disorganized families, such as the complainant's, are even more prone to exaggerate behavior,"" Clinton further claimed.In another affidavit, Clinton claimed that Shelton ""exhibits an unusual stubbornness and temper when she does not get her way.""In the audio, Clinton is heard laughing when she says: ""Of course he [the defendant] claimed he didn't [rape]. All this stuff. He took a lie-detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.""She also boasts that she ""Got [Taylor] off with time served in the county jail. He had been in the county jail about two months.""The court records show Taylor was eventually sentenced to one year in prison, with the two months reduced for the time he served in the county jail.Listening to the audio during the Breitbart News interview, Shelton reacted that some of Clinton's statements are ""totally uncalled for."" Shelton, of course, had heard the audio several times since it has been released.""Some of the stuff she says about me,"" she added. ""She didn't even know me and she is just putting this in her own mind to lie about it. To make herself look good... She knew they were guilty the whole time. But she wants to look big.""Continued Shelton:It makes me sick. I... seeing Hillary for the first time in the last debate. And three times I almost come up from there. If my attorney hadn't been sitting beside me and helping me stay calm I think I would have come up from there. Sitting there, every statement I hear she is for women and children. If she was for women or for children she wouldn't have put me through what she has put me through. ...She don't care if it's lie, cheat, or steal. She is going to get there one way or another. As long as she can get what she wants. She hurt a child inside too very bad. And she says she's for children and women? If she was for children she could have never went there with me as a twelve-year-old girl.Shelton says she didn't know it was Clinton who defended her rapist until being informed of the matter by a Newsday reporter in 2007.She was not aware of the existence of the audio until it was unearthed and published by the Washington Free Beacon in 2014.The Free Beacon further reported on the recording: ""Clinton can also be heard laughing at several points when discussing the crime lab's accidental destruction of DNA evidence that tied Taylor to the crime.""""The crime lab took the pair of underpants, neatly cut out the part that they were gonna test, tested it, came back with the result of what kind of blood it was what was mixed in with it - then sent the pants back with the hole in it to evidence,"" said Clinton in the audio. ""Of course the crime lab had thrown away the piece they had cut out.""Clinton was referring to underwear stained with blood and possibly semen that she took to a renowned New York City blood expert whose opinion she successfully used to raise questions about the forensic evidence because part of it was misplaced by a crime lab. That detail was key to Clinton's ability to obtain a plea deal for Taylor.Continued the Free Beacon:Clinton said she got permission from the court to take the underwear to a renowned forensics expert in New York City to see if he could confirm that the evidence had been invalidated.""The story through the grapevine was that if you could get [this investigator] interested in the case then you had the foremost expert in the world willing to testify, so maybe it came out the way you wanted it to come out,"" she said.She said the investigator examined the cut-up underwear and told her there was not enough blood left on it to test.When Clinton returned to Arkansas, she said she gave the prosecutor a clipping of the New York forensic investigator's ""Who's Who.""""I handed it to Gibson, and I said, 'Well this guy's ready to come up from New York to prevent this miscarriage of justice,'"" said Clinton, breaking into laughter.""So we were gonna plea bargain,"" she continued. ...Reed asked what happened to the rapist.""Oh, he plea bargained. Got him off with time served in the county jail, he'd been in the county jail for about two months,"" said Clinton.When asked why Taylor wanted a female lawyer, Clinton responded, ""Who knows. Probably saw a TV show. He just wanted one.""Speaking last month to Arkansas Online, Reed said he doesn't believe that Clinton was laughing at Shelton:""As far as her laughing, God knows she was not laughing over the notion that this rapist was going to go free,"" said Reed. ""I challenge any fair-minded reader of that transcript to make a case that Hillary Rodham was a coldblooded lawyer who was laughing over the plight of the 12-year-old rape victim.""Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Fuck you, John Podesta,"" he told journalist Dave Weigel, who then wrote for Slate. ""What's in your closet, John Podesta? Big Podesta? Big Soros? Do you want us to play these games? Because we're playing to win."" Andrew Breitbart understood that the biggest threats to America were those who pulled the strings behind the scenes to gain enormous personal power, money, and influence.Podesta is a creature of Washington, D.C., driving the leftist agenda for decades with his fingers in every pot, since serving in the Bill Clinton White House.He served as the president's chief of staff during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, working tirelessly to thwart investigations around the scandal-plagued administration. The tumultuous events reportedly spawned an alter-ego for Podesta that aides called ""Skippy"" -- the nasty side of the normally mild-mannered operative. Podesta also co-founded a massive lobbying firm with his brother, Tony Podesta, but later went on to launch the liberal think tank Center for American Progress and its multi-armed political subsidiaries.The Center for American Progress has received more than $5.5 million from liberal billionaire George Soros and millions from top American corporations. The leftist operative has remained close to power for decades and has been the subject of many fawning media profiles over the years. His lobbyist brother, Tony, has repeatedly reaped the financial rewards of Podesta's proximity to power, as the pair enjoys unprecedented access to the most powerful people in the world, including questionable ties with Saudi Arabia and Russia.Podesta expertly leverages his longstanding relationships with government officials to serve his interests and that of his employers.For example, Podesta praised lawyer Peter Kadzik -- who ""kept me out of jail"" in the Clinton administration -- for work in the Obama transition effort. After becoming the Justice Department's assistant attorney general, Kadzik leaked information to Podesta about the investigation in Hillary Clinton's email server. Podesta ran Obama's transition into power in 2008, vetting the government bureaucrats and building the vast liberal network that would serve in Obama's eight year administration. Andrew Breitbart tangled with Podesta during the ACORN scandal, as the liberal operative joined the scandal-tainted organization's advisory council. ""Since Mr. Podesta was appointed to investigate ACORN, the only thing investigated has been the investigators, Mr. O'Keefe, Ms. Giles, and the publisher of the journalism behind it, yours truly,"" Breitbart wrote in the Washington Times in 2009. When Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State during Obama's first term, Podesta followed by joining her Foreign Affairs Policy Board. President Barack Obama convinced Podesta to join his team after getting a ""shellacking"" in the midterm elections and losing the Democratic congressional majorities. Under Podesta's direction, Obama went on to use his executive power to thwart Republicans and push his agenda items despite obstruction in Congress. Podesta left Obama's administration to join Hillary Clinton's campaign, where he has orchestrated obstructionism surrounding Hillary Clinton's biggest scandals and massaged relationships with the media with intimate private dinners at his home. He has had close ties to an investment fund backed by the Russian government, but transferred his holdings to his children to avoid scrutiny. He claims not to receive a salary for working in the Clinton campaign, but he still manages to pull a $3,000 a month stipend from the campaign and $7,000 a month from Herb Sandler, a major Clinton donor. Podesta fell prey to hackers in 2015, who successfully penetrated his private Gmail account and delivered his emails to WikiLeaks, who began their daily detailed releases that exposed the inner workings of the Clinton campaign. Americans now know more about Podesta than ever before, though he remains in a central position of power in the Clinton campaign. Should Hillary Clinton win the presidency, Podesta is due for a prime position in leading the second Clinton White House.

Instead, it would move forward without funding and essentially kick the can down the road.Rector estimates that over time, amnesty for approximately ten million illegal alien adults over the course of 75 years would total roughly $3.6 trillion, in 2012 dollars. Rector writes:Advocates of amnesty have suggested that low-skill immigrants generate large-scale positive economic results that benefit U.S. workers. The NAS reports finds no evidence of such effects. On the other hand, the report clearly shows that the continuing inflow of low-skill immigrants into the U.S. creates large fiscal burdens for taxpayers in the present and the future. Moreover, granting amnesty is likely to generate even greater flows of illegal immigrants into the United States, adding even more costs.Adult illegal aliens are six times more likely not to have even a high school diploma, compared to the U.S.-born.Another NAS report found that current immigration into the U.S. takes roughly $493 billion in wages from American workers and established immigrants and gives it to major employers and newly-arrived foreign workers.Every piece of ""comprehensive immigration reform"" legislation considered in Congress since 2006 would have eventually given every single illegal alien amnesty recipient Social Security and Medicare benefits Americans paid for. Rector also notes that the illegals would quickly gain access to the entire U.S. welfare system.Advocates of amnesty have suggested that low-skill immigrants generate large-scale positive economic results that benefit U.S. workers.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe poll shows ""signs of the race trending Trump in the waning days of the campaign, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are tied in the Keystone state (46-46%, 2% Johnson, 1% Stein, 4% Undecided),"" said a statement by Harper Polling, which earns a good score in Nate Silver's ranking of polling firms.Trump's gain in Pennsylvania could be decisive, because he needs to win one of the traditionally Democratic states to reach the victory line at 270 Electoral Votes, assuming he wins all the other states where he has a polling lead. The Pennsylvania poll surveyed 504 likely voters and has an error margin of 4.4 percent. That margin means that 19 out of 20 of the poll results are within 4.4 percent of the true number. The poll was taken Nov. 2 to Nov. 3, using an automated phone call.In 2012, President Barack Obama won the state by 5.2 percent, earning 20 Electoral Votes. In 2008, Obama won the state by 10.3 percentage points.The average of recent poll results displayed by the RealClearPolitics website shows Clinton ahead by 3 percent, down from a several-point lead for most of October.

Independents prefer Trump (26-46%) but self-identified Moderates choose Clinton (57-31%).
