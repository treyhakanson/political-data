The sales to both states had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that they could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups.Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans.In July the airline also said it was in advanced talks to purchase up to 30 of Boeing's 737 narrowbody planes.Earlier in the year, Qatar Airways refused to accept three Airbus (AIR.PA) A320neo narrowbody jets, because of engine cooling issues. The airline has canceled its first A320neo delivery and said it must source alternate planes to meet demand.Engine maker Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) said in March it expected the cooling problem and other software issues to be fixed this year.Airbus is struggling to keep up with deliveries to Qatar Airways of the long-haul Airbus A350 planes. Those delays, combined with the A320neo problems, has put Qatar Airways at risk of posting a loss in the fiscal year that ends in March, Al Baker said in August.""Our relationship is very strained,"" Al Baker said in August. ""What's happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth.""SIGN UP"

But Deutsche Bank is also one of the world leaders in risk bearing, with $52 trillion in derivative positions. That amounts to 3.9 times the $13.2 trillion GDP for all of the European Union, and 13.3 times the $3.9 trillion GDP of Germany.Following a report from Bloomberg News that 10 of the approximately 200 largest hedge funds that clear derivatives trades with Deutsche Bank AG -- including Izzy Englander's $34 billion Millennium Partners, Chris Rokos's $4 billion Rokos Capital Management, and $14 billion Capula Investment Management --  U.S. stock markets began to plunge over concerns that Deutsche could potentially be subject to a bank run.Despite the hedge funds bailing out and Deutsche Bank AG's New York-listed shares falling 6.7 percent to a record low of $11.40 on September 30, a Deutsche Bank spokesman told Bloomberg that the bank is confident that the ""vast majority"" of its trading clients ""have a full understanding of our stable financial position, the current macroeconomic environment, the litigation process in the U.S. and the progress we are making with our strategy.""The amount of cash sought by the U.S. Justice Department is not far from the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank's entire stock market value of $15.7 billion. As a sign of just how much risk the markets think may be in holding in the German lender's unsecured debt, the cost of buying credit-default swap protection jumped to 536 basis points, the highest level since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.After the Lehman Brothers panic kicked off the last financial crisis, U.S. banks were forced to deleverage their balance sheets by about 50 percent. But European banks never took tangible action toward reducing their leveraged business and refused to recapitalize.The pressure on Deutsche Bank is beginning to spill over into German politics, stirring speculation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's government might be forced to offer support. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer John Cryan told the Bild newspaper this week that government aid was ""out of the question."" But any taxpayer-funded solution for the bank's troubles would lead to Merkel's downfall, according to the leader of Germany's biggest opposition party.The International Monetary Fund in June said Deutsche Bank may be the biggest contributor to risk among so-called global systemically important banks. Most analysts still think Deutsche Bank is solvent. But many are wondering: if there's a slim chance it might not be risky, why leave money in there?That type of lack of confidence in a banks can quickly turn into a Lehman Brothers-type panic run on deposits. Due to the cross-holdings of shared risk between big banks, if one bank gets in trouble, then a contagion can spread quickly to other banks and other nations around the world.This morning, Bank of China raised a red flag on the country's growing property bubble, according to the South China Morning Post. ""A property bubble is the biggest risk for China's economy"" as ""residential prices in major Chinese cities, from Shanghai to Shenzhen are rising at an annual pace of 30 or 40 percent in 2016, sucking the majority of bank credit into the property market and pushing prices beyond what is affordable for most residents there,"" said economist Zhou Jingtong, with the state-owned Bank of China.SIGN UP"

An additional 765 have been wounded.O'Brien's report noted that the UN now calculates that 861,200 Syrians are trapped in sieges -- a nearly 50 percent increase from the last estimate of 586,200. The new figure reflects the government's protracted blockade around eastern Aleppo, where an estimated 250,000 people live.Most of the besieged citizens, divided across at least 18 locations around the country, are trapped by government forces, and international observers are beginning to accuse both Damascus and its close ally Moscow of war crimes.The UN embarked on an ambitious plan early this year to establish regular humanitarian access to Syrians living under various sieges but was reportedly stymied by the government as well as a restrictive covenant between rebels and the government to limit assistance to 60,000 of the most distressed, divided among four towns. At that time, a total of 487,000 Syrians were estimated to be living under siege.O'Brien said certain Security Council members bore responsibility for global inaction on Syria and ended his address saying it was time to ""place the blame.""In Aleppo, rescue crews were working for the third straight day to clear the rubble and search for survivors of presumed Russian or Syrian government airstrikes on the eastern al-Shaar and al-Mashhad neighborhoods that flattened residential buildings and killed at least 23 civilians, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Germany and Turkey condemned what they called ""blatant breaches of international humanitarian law"" and renewed calls for a cease-fire.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who spoke by phone Thursday, said Russia, the Syrian government's chief backer on the international stage, bears ""special responsibility to calm the violence and thereby give any chance to a political process,"" according to a statement released by Merkel's office.The White House said Thursday that Merkel also spoke with US President Barack Obama by phone, and both agreed that Russia and the Syrian regime ""bear special responsibility for ending the fighting in Syria and granting the UN humanitarian access to besieged and hard to reach areas in Syria.""Meanwhile, airstrikes destroyed the last remaining bakery in Anadan, an opposition town north of Aleppo, activists said.Adnan Medlej, an activist from Anadan, said the bakery was hit shortly after it distributed bread to the town's remaining 2,000 residents and others in nearby villages. After intense bombings that devastated the town's infrastructure, most residents have fled to other areas in rural Aleppo province.A video shot by Medlej shows the bakery destroyed and a crater outside, with water leaking and walls scorched.On Wednesday, government shelling near a bread distribution center in Aleppo city killed six people.Meanwhile the US and Russia escalated their war of words over the catastrophe as government forces kept up their assault on Aleppo's rebel-held quarters.Government forces seized the Handarat neighborhood along the contested city's northern flank, forcing rebels to withdraw further from a crucial supply route to the city's east, the Castello Road, pro-government media and observers said. A government blockade of the road has kept the opposition-run east under siege since mid-July, with the exception of a month-long period where rebels broke through the government's southern line.But gains have proven ephemeral in the battle for Aleppo: government forces captured Handarat last Saturday, only to surrender it again Sunday.Syria's military also released a video purporting to show a freshly captured neighborhood in the city's historic center.The video shows damaged traditional buildings, with arched ceilings and stone walls, in the Farafra neighborhood which rests at the foot of the city's towering central citadel. Soldiers and allied militants are seen walking past mounds of debris, twisted metal bars, and caved-in ceilings. The government claimed it expelled rebels from the front-line neighborhood Tuesday.A top Russian diplomat meanwhile called a US threat to halt cooperation with Russia in the Syria conflict an ""emotional breakdown"" and said Russia is willing to support a 48-hour cease-fire around Aleppo.Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Thursday rejected Washington's calls for a seven-day pause in hostilities, but said Russia is willing to support a 48-hour truce for humanitarian purposes.Damascus blocked assistance from reaching eastern Aleppo during a week-long cease-fire which collapsed earlier this month.SIGN UP"

Gretta Vosper slowly began doubting the truths of Christianity until she found herself an avowed atheist, denying not only the divinity of Jesus Christ but even the notion of God altogether. All this time, however, she continued to lead her church, deemphasizing questions of the supernatural while stressing community based on secular values of inclusiveness and compassion.Reports suggest that the 58-year-old pastor has a ""loyal following"" at her Protestant congregation in suburban Toronto, which she describes as a good fit for nonbelievers ""looking for a community that will help them create meaningful lives without God.""Meanwhile, however, even in the liberal United Church of Canada, members have begun to question the suitability of a church leader who denies God's existence, especially when her resistance to faith seems to border on provocation. Vosper has announced that it is time that the Christian church gave up on ""the idolatry of a theistic god.""Members of the flock have expressed their consternation in a variety of ways, wondering aloud how a declared atheist can be allowed to lead a confessionally Christian congregation.""My understanding is that the United Church of Canada is a 'Christian' church based on the teachings of Jesus Christ,"" Pamella Fell wrote on a United Church website. ""Why, why, why is she still with the UCC if she isn't a Christian?""A columnist in the Toronto Star even suggested that a Christian church sponsoring an atheist minister is like ""Alcoholics Anonymous hosting a pub crawl.""In the face of the uproar over this glaring contradiction, a special committee of the Toronto Conference of the United Church has finally taken action, and earlier this month requested that the Church's General Council conduct a formal hearing of the case.""In our opinion, she is not suitable to continue in ordained ministry because she does not believe in God, Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit. Ms. Vosper does not recognize the primacy of scripture, she will not conduct the sacraments, and she is no longer in essential agreement with the statement of doctrine of The United Church of Canada,"" the divided committee said in its report.And still the United Church, which prides itself on its inclusiveness, is treating the matter gingerly, reluctant to declare anything off-limits.""At the heart of the concerns being raised is a tension between two core values, both of which are central to our identity as United Church. The first is our faith in God. The second is our commitment to being an open and inclusive church,"" wrote the Right Reverend Jordan Cantwell, head (moderator) of the United Church of Canada.The crux of the matter seems to be that for a church that has progressively embraced every aspect of secular culture, it has become hard to say ""no"" to anything. With a wink to the Bible, the United Church has accepted abortion and same-sex marriage and divorce and female ordination and openly gay ministers. But atheism seems a bridge too far.In other words, for the United Church, it's all right to ""mold"" your idea of God so that he (or she) can approve of homosexual sex and trangenderism and killing babies in the womb, but please don't deny the divinity outright.Then again, for Canada's largest Protestant denomination, perhaps atheism is the greatest ""protest"" of all. ""For some,"" wrote Rev. Cantwell, having an atheist minister ""is simply a natural extension of our commitment to be an open, inclusive, and questioning church,"" adding that ""diversity in our church has been and will continue to be a source of strength.""""It's tough on the United Church because we've created this mantra of inclusiveness and now it's been tested,"" said the Rev. Don Schweitzer, a professor of theology at St. Andrew's College in Saskatoon. ""It goes against the grain to tell somebody that you have to leave.""Follow Thomas D.

Obama briefly greeted the Palestinian leader with a kiss on each cheek before walking down the line to stand next to Netanyahu.Peres, who died two weeks after a stroke, jointly won a Nobel Prize for his peace efforts with the Palestinians in the 1990s, landmark talks that have failed to achieve a final land-for-peace agreement.Obama and Netanyahu were to deliver eulogies at the cemetery, which overlooks the Jerusalem forest and a verdant valley, in what could be an opportunity for the president to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to revive peacemaking.U.S. officials have held open the possibility of Obama making another formal effort to get peace negotiations back on the agenda before he leaves office in January, possibly via a U.N. Security Council resolution.With time short between the end of the funeral and the start of the Jewish sabbath at sundown, no plans were announced for any diplomacy on Friday. Obama and Netanyahu, who have had a testy relationship, last held talks on Sept. 21 in New York, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.Peres will be buried in a Jewish religious ceremony, in a plot between two former prime ministers, Yitzhak Rabin and Yitzhak Shamir. Rabin was assassinated by an ultranationalist Israeli in 1995 over the interim peace deals that he and Peres reached with the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.""A light has gone out,"" Obama said in a statement after Peres died in a hospital near Tel Aviv on Wednesday, two weeks after suffering a stroke.Outside Israel's parliament on Thursday, an estimated 50,000 Israelis filed past Peres's flag-draped coffin as it lay in state.Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, arriving in Israel a day before the burial, visited the plaza in front of parliament to stand, head bowed, in front of Peres's casket.The leaders of Egypt and Jordan, the only Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel, were not on the roster of participants issued by Israel's Foreign Ministry. But the Egyptian foreign minister was scheduled to attend and King Abdullah of Jordan sent a telegram of condolences.Obama was leading a delegation of 33 U.S. officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry and Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader in the House of Representatives.Britain's Prince Charles, French President Francois Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Polish President Andrzej Duda, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former British leaders David Cameron and Tony Blair were also on a long list of foreign dignitaries attending the funeral.Israel laid on heavy security, deploying some 8,000 police and intermittently closing the main highway between Tel Aviv's airport and Jerusalem for Obama's motorcade.SIGN UP"

It was to be the governor's banner economic initiative with the SolarCity factory as the cornerstone and a pledge of 1,460 direct factory jobs.With the state-of-the-art solar panel factory now ready for equipment to be installed, the wisdom of the entire program is being scrutinized--and is coming up short.First, on September 22, two of Cuomo's closest aides--along with several others--were charged in corruption and fraud cases involving state contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Addressing the press at his Manhattan office, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara asserted: ""that 'pervasive corruption and fraud' infested one of the governor's signature economic development programs. Companies got rich, and the public got bamboozled.""One of the companies that received the lucrative contracts was LPCiminelli--run by ""Cuomo mega-donor"" Louis Ciminelli. He allegedly offered bribes to Cuomo confidante Todd Howe--who has admitted to pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars from developers to rig bids on multimillion-dollar state contracts linked to Buffalo Billion projects.Ciminelli received the $750 million contract to build the SolarCity plant. The Buffalo News cites Bharara as saying: ""the state's bidding process for the factory being built for SolarCity at RiverBend in South Buffalo turned into a 'criminal' enterprise that favored LPCiminelli, where company executives were given inside information about how the deal was to be awarded.""Part of Cuomo's deal with SolarCity--in which the state owns the building and equipment with SolarCity leasing it under a 10-year deal--requires the company to meet a timetable of job-creation quotas or pay hefty penalties. Even before the building was complete, however, the company slashed its job commitment from 1460 to 500. With the state's $750 million investment, that works out to $1.5 million per manufacturing job.Even the 500 jobs will only materialize if the plant actually starts production--currently slated for June 2017. SolarCity's future is, as Crain's New York Business puts it: ""uncertain.""Amid the company's myriad problems are the facts that it has never been profitable, nor does it have manufacturing experience.In February 2014, SolarCity's stock price peaked at about $85 a share. Today, a share is less than $20. Crains reports that it posted a $251 million loss in Q1 2016 and a loss of $230 million in Q2.SolarCity is, according to the Buffalo News, facing a ""cash bind""--this despite receiving billions in federal and state grants and tax credits. SolarCity's model--which finances its solar panel installations, in order to make a profit on a lease that can be as long as 30 years, while it collects the lucrative government incentives worth billions (a practice for which Solar City is currently under Congressional investigation)--requires constantly raising new money from investors.Then there is the manufacturing angle. Originally, the Buffalo plant was going to manufacture high-efficacy solar panel modules developed by Silevo--a company SolarCity bought in 2014. Crain's reports that it will instead produce complete solar roofs. Something it says ""Dow Chemical recently abandoned after five years because it could not find a way to make a profit on the technology."" But then, the Buffalo News says: ""The initial production in Buffalo is expected to include photovoltaic cells that SolarCity purchases from suppliers and are used in the products that will be assembled in the South Park Avenue factory.""Whatever the plant builds or manufactures, getting it operating will be expensive--even with the New York taxpayers owning the building and equipment--and will drain scarce cash from SolarCity at a time when its financing costs have increased.Buffalo residents wonder if they'll be stuck with the world's largest empty warehouse and without the promised jobs.No wonder the entire project is in doubt. Because of the Cuomo administration corruption allegations, other proposed job-creators, including IBM, have pulled out until the probe is completed.For now, Cuomo is not a part of the criminal complaint--though his name is mentioned many times--and he claims he knew nothing about it, nor does he think he's a target of the ongoing federal probe. ""It is almost inconceivable the governor didn't know what was going on,"" Doug Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College, said. ""And if he didn't know what was going on, you can argue he should have known.""Bharara has suggested that the better name for the program would be: ""The Buffalo Billion Fraud and Bribery Scheme.""The Buffalo Billion project is a ""symbol"" of the political promises and crony corruption that takes taxpayers dollars to reward political donors and then walks away when the jobs don't materialize.The author of Energy Freedom, Marita Noon serves as the executive director for Energy Makes America Great Inc., and the companion educational organization, the Citizens' Alliance for Responsible Energy (CARE).

Previous reports from federal and law enforcement sources indicated that no connection had been yet made to terrorism and that Cetin had mental troubles.Monday morning Cetin was charged with five counts of first degree murder in the mall killings, according to the Washington Post. Cetin admitted to detectives that he carried out the Friday mall murders. A Navy base spokesman told the Post that Cetin was the dependent of a Navy retiree. His mother was in the courtroom during court proceedings on Monday.Cetin came to the United States as a child, according to King 5 News, which cited federal officials' statement that he is now a permanent resident -- not a U.S. citizen. That report further stated that he appears to have voted in at least three U.S. election cycles despite not being a citizen. Investigators are looking into Cetin for what Washington state records show, that he registered to vote in 2014 and has voted since. That appears to include voting in the state's May primary election. He also made a January 2015 Twitter post about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Cetin was recently charged for drunk driving and in 2014 and 2015 was three times charged for assaulting his stepfather, according to the Post, which cited court records.Several accounts note sexual harassment of women and assault. The Associated Press reported that his posts to a blog on the website Tumblr also included serial killer Ted Bundy, Area51, Khameni, and al-Baghdadi.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana SIGN UP

They checked the Chicago Tribune-which keeps a running tally on homicides and shooting victims-and found there had been ""3,210 shooting victims"" between January 1 and September 26 alone. Politifact then pointed out that one shooting may have more than one victim, so thousands of shooting victims does not necessarily translate into thousands of shootings.To solve this quandary, they turned to the Chicago Police Department which reported ""2,521 shooting incidents"" in the city between January 1 and September 18.Politifact then ruled that Trump's statement about ""thousands of shootings"" in Chicago is ""true,"" but in the course of their report they could not resist pointing out that every shooting did not result in a homicide.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

According to the Boston Globe, ""Legalization has ushered in thousands of new jobs in the burgeoning industry, brought $135 million into state coffers last year, and ended the prohibition of a widely used substance.""The state has also seen a drop in highway deaths as well as a drop in overdose death of harder illegal drugs such as heroin. The DEA acknowledges that there has never been a reported death from an overdose of marijuana. According to the Washington Post, ""On its own, marijuana is not known to have any fatal dosage level. The DEA itself acknowledges that nobody has ever died from marijuana alone.""A Breitbart/ Gravis poll released late last week shows ""In Colorado, a swing state with nine electoral votes, Trump leads Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton by four points--outside the survey's 3.5 percent margin of error. Trump, at 41 percent, leads Clinton--who has just 37 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson takes six percent and Dr. Jill Stein of the Green Party takes six percent, and 10 percent of the voters polled are undecided. The poll, conducted from Sept. 22 to Sept. 23, surveyed 799 registered voters in Colorado.""As Trump surges in the all-important battleground state of Colorado, Clinton's comments could hinder her mother's ability to reach out to a large group of voters who support the legalization of the same ""drug"" that Clinton lied about. The most current Colorado poll shows Trump and Clinton in a dead heat. Only one point separates the two candidates. According to a CNN/ORC poll, ""In Colorado, likely voters break 42% for Trump, 41% for Clinton, 13% for Libertarian Gary Johnson and 3% for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.""In a statement to the Washington Post Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Clinton stated, ""While discussing her [Chealsea Clinton] and her mother's support for rescheduling marijuana to allow for further study of both its medical benefits and possible interactions with other medications, Chelsea misspoke about marijuana's interaction with other drugs contributing to specific deaths."" She went on to say, ""Hillary Clinton has said we should allow states that have reformed their marijuana laws to act as laboratories for our democracy and we should reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule II substance.""Chelsea Clinton implies here that marijuana can kill you.

Rand Paul, Texas' Sen. Ted Cruz and South Carolina's Sen. Lindsey Graham. The two AWOL members were Vermont's Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran as a Democrat for the White House, and Virginia's Sen. Tim Kaine, now the Democratic nominee for vice president.After the upper chamber approved the bill, the House then quickly approved the bill 342-to-85. Seventy-five Republicans voted against the bill. Joining the opposition was Rep. Bill Flores (R.-Texas), the chairman of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), which presents itself as the conservative bloc in the House. A quick calculation concludes that most of the 170 members of the ""conservative"" RSC deserted their leader during Wednesday's vote.Flores filed his own version of the continuing resolution (CR) on Sept. 20, which would have ended funding for Planned Parenthood, spending increases, the Export-Import Bank and so-called green energy subsidies, as well as blocking the transfer of the Internet from the control of the United States to an international consortium and President Barack Obama's plan to bring in more Syrian refugees. But, the bill did not make it to the House floor.Constitutionally, all spending and tax legislation must originate in the House, giving the people's chamber the advantage of initiative.But, the Republican House and Senate leadership schemed to hot wire the Regular Order of the legislative process, by taking a bill that passed the House in June to fund legislative operations, HR 5325, and treating it as a shell for funding the federal government through Dec. 9.Instead of objecting to this ruse to supplant the House as the unmoved mover, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) consented to his Senate counterpart, with Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R.-Ky.) negotiating with retiring Minority Leader Harry Reid (D.-Nev.) to produce a CR that included all of the president's programs that Republicans have objected to, plus additional funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the $1.1 billion program to combat the Zika virus, $500 million for assistance to flooding victims in Louisiana and other states and $170 million to help the lead-contaminated water crisis in Flint, Michigan.In McConnell bill, there were none of the conservative policy riders, such as were proposed in the Sept. 20 Flores bill.Tuesday, Reid and the Senate Democrats prevented McConnell from reaching the 60-vote threshold to end debate and force a floor vote because his measure did not include the money for Flint. But, after this shot across his bow, the Republican Senate leader gave Reid everything he wanted.In the House of Representatives, members were given a copy of the McConnell-sponsored, but Reid-crafted, bill six hours before they were told to vote, according to a Capitol Hill source familiar with the process before the vote.With the government shutdown averted until Dec. 9, the members of the House and Senate have left the Capital. The House meets again Sept. 30 before leaving Washington until Nov. 14, the day before the Senate is scheduled to return to session.While the Dec. 9 deadline may seem far away with plenty of time for Congress to pass a new budget for fiscal year 2017, Congress is out of session for the fourth week of November. Once they return for the two weeks after Thanksgiving, that bring us to the CR's expiration date.SIGN UP"

Police, had Mental Problems	"The Associated Press is reporting that officials twice tried and failed to deport Alfred Olango, the former refugee with a history of mental problems who was shot and killed by police in El Cajon, California on Tuesday.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERU.S. authorities tried twice to deport the unarmed black man fatally shot by police in a San Diego suburb, but his native Uganda refused to take him, resulting in his release.Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement to The Associated Press that Alfred Olango stopped reporting to officers in February 2015. Spokeswoman Virginia Kice didn't know if officers tried to find him after that.Olango arrived as a refugee in 1991 and was ordered deported in 2002 after being convicted on drug charges. He was released under a U.S. Supreme Court ruling barring detention of foreign nationals after six months if deportation is unlikely.Immigration authorities took Olango into custody in 2009 after a firearms conviction in Colorado but were again unable to obtain travel documents.Olango, 38, was shot and killed Tuesday by police in El Cajon after pulling out a large electronic cigarette, known as a vape pen, from his pocket and pointing it at the police officer who fired, while a second officer stood nearby trying to subdue him with a stun gun, according to police. A family attorney said Olango was having an emotional breakdown over the recent death of his best friend.Each year, the federal government releases thousands of deportable aliens from jail back into Americans' neighborhoods, because their home countries do not want the dangerous criminals returned home. For example, Thong Vang, a 37-year-old Laotian national, was allowed to stay following his release from jail in 2014 after raping three girls in 1998. He shot shot two courtroom officers in September 2016.Olango's death has prompted several days of protests in El Cajon.The mental health of refugees has been a significant problem for decades, as the Utah Refugee Mental Health Subcommittee reported in 2015:* A study conducted by The Harvard Program in Refugee Torture found that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the refugee communities has been revealed to be up to ten times higher than in a nontraumatized population (Fazel, M., et al., 2005)* Studies have also documented a greater prevalence of psychiatric disorders among refugee populations when compared to the general population; these disorders include: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, somatization, and adjustment reactions(Ovitt, N., et al., 2003)

USAID plans its development and assistance programs in coordination with the Department of State,"" according to the State Department's website.The head of USAID at the time was Rajiv Shah, who was a former top director with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Microsoft has been one of the nation's biggest lobbyist for expansive immigration policies, which would allow corporations to replace American tech workers with foreign laborers who will work for a fraction of the Americans workers' salary. For example, in 2014 Microsoft pushed for greater admissions of low-wage foreign workers into the United States at the same time as the tech giant was laying off 18,000 of its own employees.In August of 2010, trade magazine Information Week reported on USAID's plan to use taxpayer dollars to help companies outsource American jobs. In a piece titled, ""U.S. To Train 3,000 Offshore IT Workers,"" Information Week wrote:Despite President Obama's pledge to retain more hi-tech jobs in the U.S., a federal agency run by a hand-picked Obama appointee has launched a $36 million program to train workers, including 3,000 specialists in IT and related functions, in South Asia... Following their training, the tech workers will be placed with outsourcing vendors in the region that provide offshore IT and business services to American companies looking to take advantage of the Asian subcontinent's low labor costs.Under director Rajiv Shah, the United States Agency for International Development will partner with private outsourcers in Sri Lanka to teach workers there advanced IT skills like Enterprise Java (Java EE) programming, as well as skills in business process outsourcing and call center support. USAID will also help the trainees brush up on their English language proficiency. USAID is contributing about $10 million to the effort...In a separate report, Information Week documented the government's efforts in Armenia:Even as controversy mounts over its funding of IT outsourcers in South Asia, the U.S. Agency for International Development has announced a program under which it will partner with the government of Armenia--a nation anxious to lure computer work from American shores-to promote the development of the country's information technology industry...Armenia is looking to establish itself as a center for low-cost IT and engineering work outsourced from the U.S. and other Western countries. USAID, a taxpayer-funded federal agency, did not disclose how much it's contributing to Armenia's efforts to become a global IT competitor. Among the U.S. companies participating in the project is Oracle's Sun Microsystems unit....USAID's efforts to help build up IT and outsourcing industries in Europe and Asia would seem to run counter to Obama's public pledges to keep more hi-tech jobs in the U.S., where unemployment in the technology industry continues to run high.""This action is contradictory to Obama's commitment to create jobs and revitalize the American economy,"" a spokesperson for WashTech, a Communications Worker of America affiliate that represents professionals, told Information Week. ""Any taxpayer money that is appropriated to train workers to take American jobs should, without question, be directed toward the unemployed and the underemployed in this country.""As Breitbart News has extensively documented, the Clintons have financial ties to the India-based Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL, which specialize in outsourcing and offshoring, and are among the top H-1B and L-1 visa employers in the U.S.Together, HCL and Tata have stolen tens of thousands of U.S. jobs from American workers all across the country. HCL and Tata are responsible for the layoffs of American workers from Disney, Southern California Edison, Northeast Utilities, Xerox, University of California, Siemens and countless others, and replace them with foreign workers on visas.In a 2004 interview with then-CNN host Lou Dobbs, Clinton defended the anti-American worker business model of these India-based outsourcing firms, declaring: ""We are not against all outsourcing; we are not in favor of putting up fences.""Similarly, in 2005, the India Review reported that during a trip to India, ""Senator Clinton allayed apprehensions in India that there would be a bar on outsourcing. 'There is no way to legislate against reality. Outsourcing will continue,' she said.""Clinton's extensive financial, personal and political ties to these India-based companies prompted the campaign of then-political rival Sen. Barack Obama to label her ""Hillary Clinton (D-Punjab)""- implying that Clinton represents foreign nations and foreign citizens rather than her own American constituents.Despite President Obama's pledge to retain more hi-tech jobs in the U.S., a federal agency run by a hand-picked Obama appointee has launched a $36 million program to train workers, including 3,000 specialists in IT and related functions, in South Asia...

Under director Rajiv Shah, the United States Agency for International Development will partner with private outsourcers in Sri Lanka to teach workers there advanced IT skills like Enterprise Java (Java EE) programming, as well as skills in business process outsourcing and call center support. USAID will also help the trainees brush up on their English language proficiency. USAID is contributing about $10 million to the effort...var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);Even as controversy mounts over its funding of IT outsourcers in South Asia, the U.S. Agency for International Development has announced a program under which it will partner with the government of Armenia--a nation anxious to lure computer work from American shores-to promote the development of the country's information technology industry...
Armenia is looking to establish itself as a center for low-cost IT and engineering work outsourced from the U.S. and other Western countries. USAID, a taxpayer-funded federal agency, did not disclose how much it's contributing to Armenia's efforts to become a global IT competitor. Among the U.S. companies participating in the project is Oracle's Sun Microsystems unit....
USAID's efforts to help build up IT and outsourcing industries in Europe and Asia would seem to run counter to Obama's public pledges to keep more hi-tech jobs in the U.S., where unemployment in the technology industry continues to run high.SIGN UP"

Governor Pushes ‘David Ortiz Bridge’ over I-90 in Boston	"Bostonians named a tunnel for Ted Williams and a pole for Johnny Pesky. Why not a bridge for Big Papi?SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERState officials, including Governor Charlie Baker, seek to rename the Brookline Avenue Bridge the David Ortiz Bridge. The overpass spans the Mass Pike between Kenmore Square and Fenway Park. Appropriately, it brings fans walking from the Kenmore Square MBTA stop to Fenway Park and brings fans from Fenway Park to the route of the Boston Marathon about a mile from its finish line. Ortiz played a major role in the healing of the city after the 2013 marathon bombings by loudly informing in Improper Bostonian fashion, ""This is our f--in' city.""""Ortiz's accomplishments and heroics on and off the baseball field have made him a living legend, and his heartfelt contributions to the communities here and in his native Dominican Republic have made him an icon,"" Governor Baker explained in pushing for the public honor for the Olde Towne Team player. ""As a lifelong Red Sox fan, I am thrilled to be able to help our Commonwealth create a lasting 'Thank You' to Big Papi through the renaming of this bridge.""State legislators vote on a bill that includes the proposal with bipartisan support on Thursday.Fans in New York plan a very different going-away present. An online campaign lobbies fans to expose their backsides to Big Papi during his first at-bat in his last game at Yankee Stadium Thursday night. ""If ten people moon Big Papi, they'll be arrested,"" MoonBigPapi.com informs. ""If ten thousand people Moon Big Papi, they'll tell their grandchildren they were there.""The designated hitter completes one of his best campaigns of a 20-year career. He leads the American League in doubles, slugging percentage, and OPS. Although slumping in his last series in Yankee Stadium, Ortiz boasts a .316 average, 37 home runs, and 124 RBI. He broke Dave Kingman's the major-league record for home runs in a final season in 2016 and once again helped lead the Boston Red Sox from worst to first.SIGN UP"
