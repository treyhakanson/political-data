Joni Ernst: Islamic State ‘Growing More Overt in Latin America’	"The Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), as it loses territory in the Middle East, is infiltrating Latin America, warns Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) in a letter sent to President Barack Obama this week.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSen. Ernst is urging President Obama to take action.Obama is heading to Peru today for his last Asia-Pacific trade summit as U.S. president. Breitbart News, citing U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) and other sources, has repeatedly reported that ISIS and other jihadist groups, namely Iran's narco-terror proxy Hezbollah, maintain a presence in Latin America. SOUTHCOM is in charge of U.S. military activity in the region. In the November 14 letter sent to President Obama ahead of his visit to Peru, Sen. Ernst wrote: ISIS and its sympathizers are growing more overt in Latin America. Their increased use of messaging in Spanish and Portuguese, coupled with calls for terror in the region, exemplify ISIS's unwavering determination to change and imbed in new surroundings...

Who was to blame for the vast and constant fluctuations in temperature before man came along?Nonetheless, the August deaths of more than 300 wild reindeer after being struck by ""unusually severe lightning"" in Norway, as well as the untimely demise of some 2,000 reindeer from anthrax in July are being attributed to the cosmic bugaboo of global warming.According to a new study published in the journal Biology Letters, more than 80,000 reindeer in the Arctic died of starvation in the Novembers of 2006 and 2013 as a result of warmer, wetter Arctic falls and winters resulting from climate change.Yet as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has noted, many of the recent climatological events and trends ""can be explained by the natural variability of the climate system,"" without excluding an indeterminate influence from atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses. In the same report, the WMO said that, at this time, researchers have not yet been able to ascertain ""the respective roles being played by climate variability and human-induced climate change.""And as Nature magazine explained in 2012, ""climate attribution"" -- the attempt to link singular weather events to manmade global warming -- ""rests on a comparison of the probability of an observed weather event in the real world with that of the 'same' event in a hypothetical world without global warming."" As critics have observed, such attribution claims ""are unjustifiably speculative, basically unverifiable and better not made at all.""The editors of the journal conclude that ""Better models are needed before exceptional events can be reliably linked to global warming.""Undaunted, the Christian Science Monitor eerily warns that the annihilation of myriad reindeer in polar regions may serve as ""an omen of what is to come with climate change.""As difficult to predict as is the weather, we can be certain of one thing: temperatures will continue rising among climate alarmists.Follow Thomas D.

He has done more to protect the jobs and enhance the wages of black workers than anyone in either house of Congress over the last 10 years,"" Kirsanow told Breitbart.Indeed, arguably no U.S. lawmaker has worked more tirelessly than Jeff Sessions to uphold the legacy of Civil Rights leader and late-Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan-who, in arguing for immigration reductions, famously declared that immigration policy ""ought to be a place where the national interest comes first, last, and always.""""Of all the Senators and public officials that I've dealt with, I cannot think of anyone who has been more devoted to issues related to wages and employment levels of all Americans, but particularly black American workers,"" Kirsanow said of Sessions.It's a matter that we have discussed in several Congressional hearings-- the most recent of which was in March of this year. He has chaired the [Senate] subcommittee dealing with the impact of... immigration on the employment levels of black Americans.""He is a man of tremendous integrity. I think it was an inspired pick,"" Kirsanow added. ""He's going to be a marvelous Attorney General.""""Senator Sessions has been a leader in the fight for preserving American jobs and ensuring opportunities for African American workers,"" civil rights attorney and founder of the Black American Leadership Alliance, Leah Durant, told Breitbart News.William Smith, the first Republican African American to serve as Chief Counsel on the Senate Judiciary committee, similarly applauded the announcement:I had the opportunity to work with Senators Sessions for close to 10 years.  Throughout that time, he was more a friend and confidant than the boss.  I believe he hired me as the first ever Republican African American Chief Counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee and I'm not sure there has been another one since me.  After I moved to Alabama to practice law and then returned to Washington, Senator Sessions offered me the position of Chief Counsel on the full Judiciary Committee and then basically created a position for me on his Senate Budget Committee, where I continued as his Chief.""Jeff Sessions is a man of high character and great integrity. He would make an outstanding Attorney General and I'm excited to support him 100 percent,"" Smith continued:[N]ot once did Senator Sessions ever say anything to offend me.  Instead, time after time, he stood by me and the conservative causes I was out to support. I remember spending several late nights in the office, not talking about working, but talking about life and family.  Senator Sessions was always concerned for my well being.  Because he is such a great man, one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made was leaving his employment.  In his kindness, he told me if I wanted to come back, I could.  He, Mary and his children have treated me like family and I'll always be grateful for that.Both Kirsanow and Durant flatly rejected corporate media's efforts to cast Sessions as anything less than a true champion of black working Americans. ""It's scandalous that they're trying to say he's a racist,"" Kirsanow told Breitbart:They are trying to demonize the Alabama of 2016 as somehow being the Alabama of 1946. And they are trying to similarly falsely caricature Sen. Sessions. But that is not the case. I've gotten the opportunity to deal with him on a regular basis and he is a wonderful human being.While corporate media is now recycling smears used 30 years ago to deny Sessions a federal judgeship in the 1980s, even individuals who voted against Sessions' confirmation at the time ultimately came to regret their decision.""My vote against candidate Sessions for the federal court was a mistake because I have since found that Sen. Sessions is egalitarian,"" said the now-deceased Democratic and Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, Arlen Specter.As the Weekly Standard's Mark Hemingway reports, the smear campaign against Sessions collapses upon even a cursory review of Sessions' actual record, which includes desegregating schools and taking on the Klan in Alabama.For instance, Sessions ""was one of the only Republican senators to support Eric Holder's nomination for attorney general,"" Hemingway notes:As a U.S. Attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in Alabama. And he also prosecuted the head of the state Klan, Henry Francis Hays, for abducting and killing Michael Donald, a black teenager selected at random. Sessions insisted on the death penalty for Hays. When he was later elected the state Attorney General, Sessions followed through and made sure Hays was executed. The successful prosecution of Hays also led to a $7 million civil judgment against the Klan, effectively breaking the back of the KKK in Alabama.Similarly, as a U.S. Senator, Sessions has led the fight to defend the jobs and wages of American workers--in particular, those of black American workers.A full two years before Trump eventually heeded Sessions' call and proclaimed that under his leadership the GOP would become a ""worker's party,"" Sessions urged the Republicans to ""becom[e] the Party of Work"" by advancing America first policies--particularly on the issues of immigration and trade-- that would prioritize and advance the interests of the working American men and women of all backgrounds and legal immigrants already here.Sessions led the fight against the Paul Ryan-backed controversial expansion to the H-2B visa program, which a 2015 Buzzfeed expose revealed is being used to disproportionately lay off and replace black American workers.Perhaps more than any other lawmaker on Capitol Hill, Sessions' office sought to give sunlight to the discriminatory hiring practices exposed by the Buzzfeed investigation.According to the report, a supervisor at Hamilton Growers told workers amid mass layoffs: ""All you black American people, f**k you all ... just go to the office and pick up your check."" The report noted:According to a lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, about 80 workers, many of them black, were simply told: 'All you Americans are fired."" [...] Time after time, the grower filled the jobs with foreign guest workers instead [of American workers]... many businesses go to extraordinary lengths to skirt the law, deliberately denying jobs to American workers so they can hire foreign workers on H-2 visas instead.Sessions also used his position as Chairman of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee to expose the plight of American workers suffering from other visa policies favored by corporate special interests-- such as the H-1B visa and the J-1 visa program. Bernie Sanders has described the J-1 visa program as a ""low-wage jobs program [that] allow[s] corporations to hire cheaper foreign labor"" over American workers. Sanders explained that this visa program is helping to create ""a permanent underclass"" of disadvantaged American youths, particularly Americans youths in the inner cities.The J-1 visa program allows corporations to replace young American workers with cheaper labor from abroad. http://t.co/tSCEuFkTeX-- Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) June 20, 2013On the issue of white-collar immigration, ""Senator Sessions has been the leader in pushing for H-1B reform,"" said Professor Ron Hira, who teaches at Howard University, the prominent historically black college located in the heart of Washington D.C.""[Sessions'] H-1B reforms would help create jobs and raise wages for Americans, and would especially help workers from underrepresented groups [in the technology industry] such as Hispanic-Americans and African-Americans,"" Hira told Breitbart.Sessions was also near single-handedly responsible for leading the conservative movement's opposition to globalist trade pacts, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership, which the AFL-CIO suggested would turn black Americans in the inner cities into ""American refugee[s]"" in their own communities.Indeed, although it tends to go unreported by corporate media, Sessions has done-and has risked more professionally-than perhaps any lawmaker in Washington to advance the interests of American workers.For instance, while corporate media celebrates far-left Senator Elizabeth Warren and tries to paint her as an advocate for working families, corporate media almost never reports on Warren's decision to join a coalition of special interests and billionaires. That coalition included the Koch Brothers, Mark Zuckerberg, the Chamber of Commerce, Rupert Murdoch, George Soros, and Michael Bloomberg, and was intended to push policies that would flood the labor market with foreign workers and drive down wages for American working families.As Kirsanow has previously explained, ""competition from immigration accounts for approximately 40 percent of the 18-percentage point decline in black employment in recent years... That's nearly a million jobs lost by blacks to immigrants.""By contrast, Sessions opposed the low-wage, high-immigration donor class policies supported by both Elizabeth Warren and Paul Ryan.For years, Sessions has worked as a vocal advocate for the America worker against special moneyed interests--often taking on his Party's own members and donors.Significantly, unlike Sen. Warren, Sen. Sessions has gored sacred cows of his own Party.As one political operative previously told Breitbart, Warren's views represent a brand of ""George Clooney populism,"" in which one expresses views and sentiments that will be widely cheered by celebrities, entertainers, and media institutions that dominate the commercial culture.By contrast, in his now-famous 2014 Masters of Universe speech, Sessions called out billionaires and immigration expansionists Mark Zuckerberg, Carlos Slim, and Rupert Murdoch. Similarly, following Microsoft's announcement that it was firing 18,000 workers, Sessions took to the Senate floor to expose the ""super billionaires"" -- such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Sheldon Adelson, for continuing to push for more H-1Bs and cheap labor while laying off American workers.Many have suspected that as recompense for his willingness to take on his own party, GOP leadership pushed Sessions out of his Budget Committee Chairmanship in favor of Republican leadership ally, Mike Enzi.Indeed, in his outspoken- and ultimately successful- crusade to stop special interests from flooding the nation with foreign workers, Sen. Sessions collected more hours speaking on the Senate floor than any other Senator in 2013. According to the Los Angeles Times, Sessions spoke for more than 33 hours that year.In his Masters of the Universe speech, Sessions spoke about how the donor class' immigration agenda would hurt job and wage opportunities for the ""single mom... [that's] trying to raise a family"" or the ""unemployed father."" Sessions argues that Americans--not foreign nationals--should have the first right to an American job.In this regard, an Attorney General Jeff Sessions will provide a marked contrast to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who made clear that she does not believe in basic job protections for American workers.It was Sessions' tough prosecutorial style of questioning of Lynch during her confirmation hearing that prompted her to admit her belief that foreign nationals illegally present in the United States are entitled to the same rights as American citizens to get U.S. jobs. Sessions pointed out that her view on this matter was not only directly at odds with our immigration laws, but it also represented an affront to American workers.""With Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, American workers will finally have a seat at the table in Washington D.C.,"" said civil rights attorney Sara Blackwell, who represents high-skilled American workers of all backgrounds, races, and ethnicities that have been displaced and discriminated against in their own country by virtue of their American nationality.""Senator Sessions has stood up against the globalists to defend the dignity and basic rights of all American workers,"" black, brown and white, Blackwell added. ""His appointment gives me hope that American workers will finally get the protections they deserve, and I know his appointment will give hope to countless hardworking American families all across the country.""It's a matter that we have discussed in several Congressional hearings-- the most recent of which was in March of this year. He has chaired the [Senate] subcommittee dealing with the impact of... immigration on the employment levels of black Americans.I had the opportunity to work with Senators Sessions for close to 10 years.

We have also pondered the likely contours of the 2018 midterm elections and how Republicans might think about solidifying their Congressional majority.  Now, we will take a look, through the prism of history, at the 2020 presidential election.  1. A New Yorker in the White House First, some background: The New York Republican presidential candidate was controversial--that's for sure.  The Democratic establishment disliked him, the media loathed him, and legions of sometimes violent street-protestors hated him.  And yet the American people liked him--after all, they had elected him president.  He had campaigned on popular themes, notably, extrication from foolish foreign entanglements, ""law and order,"" and a general routine to normalcy after eight years of increasingly bizarre left-wing Democratic dominion in the White House.  Still, because the opposition was so intense, his popular-vote percentage, even in victory, was in the mid 40s. And yet during his first term, he proved to be an effective advocate for his right-of-center policies.  Thus he consolidated his political base and won over many moderate Democrats.Furthermore, after his first victory, the New York Republican's re-election chances were greatly boosted when the Democrats went off the deep end, lurching far to the left.  Specifically, they nominated a far-left candidate who was obliterated in the voting.  And so the president sailed to a second term, winning a massive re-election landslide.Am I describing Donald Trump here?  No, I'm not, at least not yet.  None of us, here on earth, can know the future.  The best we can do is gather clues as to what will come next, and the best source of clues, as Virgil has argued, is the pattern of the past. One such pattern is a sequence of events from the relatively recent past: the 1968 election and the 1972 re-election of our 37th president, Richard Nixon.  Indeed, the parallels are instructive, and so they might serve usefully to illuminate Trump's path in the quadrennium ahead.  Trump, as we all know, was elected this year with a comfortable majority in the electoral college, but with less than a plurality of the popular vote, at last count, 46.7 percent.  So it's no wonder, then, that opponents are already saying that Trump has no true mandate.  And that, of course, is a prelude to the further effort to de-legitimize his presidency.  To be a sure, a determined Trump supporter might be quick to riposte, Give us time.  That is, since Trump has accomplished so much already, by winning as a long-shot candidate, it would be be a serious mistake to underestimate him in the future.   And thus, once again, the battle is joined.  So with Trump's future in mind, let's learn from our history. Let's consider, as a case study, how Nixon traversed from election squeaker to re-election stomper.  That is, how he went from winning 43 percent of the vote in 1968 to winning almost 61 percent in 1972.  And oh yes, Nixon won an even more spectacular victory in the electoral college--521 electoral votes, the third-largest total in U.S. history.   Nixon, of course, was originally not a New Yorker at all--he was a  Californian.  He was elected to the U.S. House from the Golden State in 1946, and then to the U.S. Senate in 1950.  Then, after eight years as Dwight Eisenhower's vice president, he suffered defeats in the 1960 presidential election and the 1962 California gubernatorial election.  After that, it was generally believed that he was washed up, politically, especially after he moved to Manhattan to take up a law practice. And so when he did decide to return to the political arena in 1968, few observers thought he could win.  As always, he was reviled by the press as ""Tricky Dick"" and dismissed by the Eastern establishment as an interloper. Yet Nixon was smart.  He could see things other couldn't see: Unlike the liberal Republican elite--epitomized by then-New York State Governor Nelson Rockefeller and New York City Mayor John Lindsay--he could see that middle-class America was horrified by the impact of liberal policies on the nation.  The impact, that is, on both personal safety, on national security, and on general sanity.   Yet at the same time, unlike the conservative ideological elite--epitomized by Barry Goldwater, the badly defeated nominee of 1964, and by William F. Buckley, the publisher of the then-influential National Review--he could see that most Americans were not ideologically right-wing; they had no desire to launch more wars abroad or to repeal the New Deal at home, including such building-block programs as Social Security and the more recently enacted Medicare.  So we can see: In terms of ideology, Nixon wasn't a liberal, but he also wasn't a right-winger; he was a man of the realistic center-right.  Thus Nixon went through the middle to win the 1968 election: He was in the middle of the GOP in the primaries, and he went through the middle of country to win the general election.  And it's in the middle, of course, where victory is most often found--either center-right or, gulp, center-left.  (In 2014, an astute observer here at Breitbart reviewed a memoir about Nixon's comeback, as recalled by no less a first-hand observer than Pat Buchanan.) And yet at the same time, as a matter of personal style, Nixon was always, at the same time, tough-minded.  He liked to call himself a ""nut cutter,"" someone who never hesitated to ""pick off the scab.""  Nixon was probably born tough, and he was made tougher by adversity in his early life, and then he was toughened even more by a searing experience early in his political career.  In the late 1940s, the lawyerly freshman Congressman led the investigation of Alger Hiss, the Soviet spy.  Yes, Hiss was a perjuring communist, but he was also a golden boy of the establishment. So in going after Hiss--in effect, prosecuting this golden member of the elite--Nixon confronted the liberal establishment, which was always strangely eager to cover up communist subversion in its midst.  Thus Nixon put himself in the left's crosshairs, and he would remain their target for the rest of his life.  Not to put too fine a point on it, the establishment despised Nixon, and Nixon despised them right back.  Yet for all his personal edge--his enemies would say, his personal demons--Nixon was, at the same time, a supreme pragmatist.  And so, for example, in the late 1960s, he could see that the then-raging Vietnam War--however well intentioned its origins might have been when launched by his predecessors--had turned into a practical failure. The common phrase back then was ""quagmire.""Thus on January 20, 1969, a new president, promising a new approach, was inaugurated as president, and Nixon's running mate, Spiro Agnew, was sworn in as vice president. Let's consider the many similarities between Nixon's situation then and Trump's situation now: *Unpopular foreign entanglements, courtesy of a Democratic predecessor?  Check. *Slow economy?  Check. *Ferocious Democratic opposition in Congress and around the country? Check.*The smug view of the establishment that the new president was somehow a mistake, even illegitimate?  Check. *Relentlessly hostile media coverage?  Check.*Motley crews of sometimes violent protestors everywhere? Check. Nixon knew well--perhaps too well--that he had lots of enemies.  Yet even so, pragmatist that he was, he set about solving major problems facing the country.  And how he went about that problem-solving is instructive, even to this day.  Indeed, it's even possible that Nixonian pragmatism might anticipate  the sort of master deal-making that Trump loves.  So as part of our case study, let's focus on the biggest policy challenge that Nixon confronted.  2. Vietnam as a Foreign Policy Issue and as a Political IssueThe hottest controversy in the country in 1969 was the Vietnam War, which the 37th president had ""inherited"" from the 36th president, Lyndon B. Johnson.   As noted, Nixon could see that the war was unwinnable, because under the palsied ""rules of engagement"" established by Johnson, the North Vietnamese could endlessly resupply and replenish their offensive forces in South Vietnam.  Moreover, the the Chinese, and the Soviets, could endlessly resupply North Vietnam. Yet by 1969, with more than half-a-million troops in the jungle, the American public was in no mood to consider further escalation as a way of possibly winning the war.  Such escalation would have meant carrying the fight directly into North Vietnam, with an eye toward disrupting those crucial supply lines.  Such an escalation, of course, would have brought the risk of a direct confrontation with China and the USSR, and thus possibly even World War Three.  It was clear to everyone that South Vietnam simply wasn't worth that sort of planetary gamble.  After all, the war had been sold to the American public as a limited war, not as an unlimited war. So again, President Nixon could see that Vietnam had to end with something short of all-out American victory.  And in fact, the collective national decision to exit Vietnam had been made the year before, in 1968, in the wake of the Tet Offensive.  Indeed, back in May 1968, under the Johnson administration, peace talks in Paris had commenced.  However, those those talks proved to be their own kind of diplomatic quagmire, as the negotiators spent months wrangling, for example, over the shape of the conference table. Why this bogging?  Because the Hanoi government, hardened by two decades of fighting and confident of ultimate victory, was simply in no mood to negotiate anything other than American and South Vietnamese capitulation.   Yet for his part, Nixon, joined by most--although by no means all--Americans, believed that America couldn't simply cut and run.  That is, we couldn't just evacuate our troops from South Vietnam, Dunkirk-style.  Painful as the war was, we still needed to maintain our national prestige and strategic credibility; we needed to achieve, as Nixon had pledged during the campaign, ""peace with honor."" Thus Nixon launched a three-track strategy: The first track was the slow and careful de-escalation of U.S. participation in the fighting.  The second track was the seeking out a new diplomatic solution to end the fighting through talks at the bargaining table.The third track was the handling of the radical anti-war protestors who wanted, as they bragged, to ""bring the war home.""  As we shall see, the protestors, often violent, played into Nixon's hands.Stepping back, we can gather that Nixon had a challenging task--but then, being president is never easy.  So now let's look at each of these three tracks in turn. First, the de-escalation track.  This was hardly an ideal approach, because it meant continuing a war, albeit at a tapering pace, that few Americans believed in.  And yet for reasons of Grand Strategy, Nixon had little choice.  Yes, Vietnam was a terrible predicament for America--and a tragedy for the GIs doing the fighting and the dying--but Nixon had to deal with the world as it was, not as he wished to be.  And that meant carrying on the fight. As Nixon said in a speech on April 30, 1970, the US had no choice but to gut it out, lest it be dramatically humiliated in the eyes of the world: If, when the chips are down, the world's most powerful nation, the United States of America, acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions throughout the world. We can further observe, with sorrow, that sometimes, as a matter of bitter necessity, good leadership means presiding over bad outcomes.  (It helped, however, that Nixon had himself served in the Pacific Theater during World War Two--nobody could accuse him of being a ""chickenhawk."") So from the perspective of nearly half a century, one can best say this:  If you see a Vietnam vet, give him a hug, because without a doubt, he got a raw deal.  In the words of the famous Tennyson poem about another misbegotten but nonetheless heroic military operation, ""Theirs not to reason why/ Theirs but to do and die."" Second, the diplomatic track.  Nixon could see, as Johnson could not, that direct negotiations with the North Vietnamese were never going to succeed.  So Nixon and his top foreign-policy aide, Henry Kissinger, hit upon a masterful stratagem that didn't seem to have occurred to the Johnson administration: They would go over the heads of the North Vietnamese and parley, instead, with Hanoi's ultimate masters in Beijing and Moscow. To be sure, these negotiations ""at the summit"" were long and torturous, especially since we did not, in those days, have diplomatic relations with China.  Yet during Nixon's first term, U.S.-China relations began to thaw, culminating in Nixon's historic trip to Beijing in February 1972.  And that historic journey was followed by a less-remembered, but also vitally important, visit to Moscow in May 1972.  In the case of both capitals, it was the first-ever trip by an American president.   In those high-stakes meetings, Nixon and Kissinger worked out a new understanding with both the Chinese and the Russians--namely, that in the near future, the U.S. would bomb North Vietnam with an intensity that had never been seen before.  This was a big deal because, in the past, the U.S. had held off such bombing out of fear that American ordnance would kill Chinese or Russian nationals on the ground in North Vietnam--of whom there were plenty.  As noted earlier, the larger fear was that such escalation could escalate into nuclear war.Yet once Nixon's new understanding with China and Russia had been worked out, the U.S. could proceed militarily against North Vietnam.  Hence the extremely intense U.S. bombing campaigns of 1972 were met, not with Chinese or Russian outrage, but, rather, with aloof indifference.  That was the difference Nixon's diplomacy had achieved.  The message to Hanoi was clear: You're on your own, now.  So you'd better negotiate in good faith with the U.S. government.The result was the Paris Peace Accords of January 1973.  And so, after a dozen years of fighting and more than 58,000 Americans dead, the war was finally over.   Unlike some more recent recipients, Kissinger had actually earned his Nobel Peace Prize.  To be sure, the deal was not completely satisfactory, but then in this world, what deal ever is?   Still, it's more than likely that the Paris Accords would have held firm, at least for a long time, were it not for the fact that Nixon was forced to resign, as a result of Watergate, in 1974.  Once Nixon was gone, the dramatically empowered Democrats--who, as a party, had flipped, going from hawkish to dovish during the Nixon years--voted in Congress to abandon South Vietnam.  Thus in 1975, the relentless North Vietnamese--bolstered, once again, by China and the Soviet Union--were finally triumphant. So we can look back and be reminded of just how consequential the Watergate scandal was: Most obviously, it ended the Nixon presidency, but, in addition, it doomed the South Vietnamese and gave the USSR a geopolitical momentum that lasted throughout the 1970s, till the coming of Ronald Reagan.   And now we can pause to consider how Trump might draw inspiration from Nixon's geopolitical genius.  We might also note that in comparison, the Watergate scandal, serious as it was at the time, will be remembered as a mere unfortunate footnote. Third, the handling-the-protestors track. In the late '60s and early '70s, many millions of Americans honorably and decently opposed the Vietnam War.  In fact, opponents of the war were a majority.  However, within this anti-war majority, major splits emerged as to how to extricate Uncle Sam from the conflict.  As noted, Nixon had said that we shouldn't just turn tail, that we should seek an honorable way out--and most Americans agreed with him.Yet for a hard core of anti-war protestors, any delay was unacceptable.  And so they took to the campus quads and to the streets demanding, ""Get Out Now!"" Moreover, a considerable number of noisy anti-war protestors went further than that--much further.  They took their activism around the bend, as it were, morphing into full-blown anti-Americans.  They were haters, and they delighted in burning the American flag to prove it.  These angry people proclaimed themselves to be ""revolutionaries,"" forming themselves into groups such as Students for a Democratic Society and the Weather Underground.They vandalized public buildings, terrorized ordinary people, and organized themselves into pro-communist terrorist cells, from which they committed further crimes.  (One of the best known of these radicals was Bill Ayers, who later became a mentor to Barack Obama.)Meanwhile, the entire youthful counter-culture descended into a self-indulgent orgy of drugs, sex, and rock-and-roll.Of course, all this craziness was appalling to most Americans.  And so for every self-identified member of ""Woodstock Nation,"" there were a hundred who continued to play by the rules, pay their taxes, and serve their country. Thus we can see an emerging political dynamic: The antics of the hippies, and the crimes of the Weathermen, did not, as they said back then, play well in Peoria.  And for his part, Nixon, crafty politician that he was, soon realized that he could take advantage of the situation--that is, use the protestors as a foil.  Nixon made the case to Middle America: Who should run the country: The elected president, along with other constitutional officers, or these radical protestors?  The opinion numbers associated with that dichotomy weren't even close: Nixon had the greater majority with him, even among moderate and conservative Democrats (there were plenty back then) who didn't like Nixon. Yes, Nixon skillfully played his hand.  In a televised speech to the nation on November 30, 1969, he asked the ""silent majority"" to stand with him, and with America as we had known it--and not with the radicals. That phrase, ""silent majority,"" was used only once in the speech, but it had an electric effect across the country.  The folks at home knew that Nixon was talking to them, just as FDR had three decades earlier, in his famous fireside chats. Meanwhile, that same year, the popular country and western song, Merle Haggard's Okie from Muskogee, also struck a resonant chord in the popular culture: We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take our trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
We like livin' right, and bein' freeThus a new center-right consciousness was born.  And at the end of 1969, Time magazine named ""The Middle Americans"" as its Man and Woman of the Year.Thus politically, Nixon was on his way.  He was the leader of what was called ""the emerging Republican majority.""  And unlike, say, an ideologue such as Goldwater, Nixon was careful not to antagonize public opinion: In office, he was no enemy of labor unions, and he even increased Social Security by initiating an annual inflation-based Cost Of Living Allowance for retirees.  (A smart take on the making of the Nixon majority can be found here at Breitbart.)In addition, beginning in 1969, Nixon unleashed Vice President Spiro Agnew to attack the biased media.  Agnew's famous volleys of angry alliteration--referring to the pundits, for example, as ""nattering nabobs of negativism,"" were political gold, and became part of political folklore.  Indeed, Agnew's adversarial stance has provided the template that's been used ever since by Republican/conservative critics of the MSM.  (In 1973, Agnew was forced to resign because of a personal financial scandal, unrelated to Watergate.) Yet because of his personality, as well as the polarized opinion of that era, Nixon himself was never truly popular, and after June 1972, the Watergate scandal, avidly stoked by the Democrats and the media, began to take its toll. And yet at the same time, Nixon benefited from the nuttiness of his enemies.  As Virgil has described, the Democrats, swept up in anti-war/countercultural enthusiasm, veered way to the left.  And so their presidential nominee in 1972 was the hopelessly unelectable Sen. George McGovern. Despite the bleeding from Watergate, Nixon carried 49 states that November, garnering 60.7  percent of the popular vote.  Considering that he had won just 43.4 percent of the vote in 1968, that was a 17-point jump.  In fact, it was, and still is, the largest percentage increase for a single president in U.S. history--not bad!   And oh, by the way, in '72 Nixon won 73.7 percent of the vote of Merle Haggard's proud Okies in the Sooner State.3. The Nixon Lesson: Implications for Trump Trump, born in 1946, obviously remembers all this history--he was there to see it. Today, as the soon-to-be 45th president prepares to take power, the U.S. doesn't face a foreign military crisis as severe as was Vietnam in Nixon's day.  And yet still, there are plenty of crises that could benefit from fresh strategic thinking.  We can start with the grim situation in Afghanistan and Iraq, which count as the two mini-Vietnams that Trump has inherited from Barack Obama. But first, let's take a moment to consider the challenge of waging a counterinsurgency, whether it be in Vietnam in the '60s and '70s, or in  Afghanistan and Iraq in the '00s and '10s. Here's a general rule for policymakers: If the counter-insurgency is aimed at an insurgency that can be resupplied and replenished from a contiguous country, it's highly unlikely that the counter-insurgency will prevail.  To put this point more bluntly, the counter-insurgent force must isolate the insurgents--or else, admit defeat.  We can add that failure to isolate the insurgents was the mistake that the U.S. made in Afghanistan.  Yes, it was easy enough for American forces to occupy Kabul in 2001, thus ejecting the Taliban regime.  And yet in the years after, as the American mission morphed from legitimate punitive expedition in the wake of 9/11 to an amorphous goal of ""nation building,"" the original successful mission became, sadly, a ""mission impossible.""  That is, so long as the Taliban, scattered as it was, could be resupplied through Afghanistan's porous border with Pakistan, it was never going to be defeated--at least not by the U.S., with its finicky rules of engagement.  And since Pakistan, population 180 million, has close ethnic- and religious ties to most of the Afghan people, there will never be a shortage of new Taliban fighters.  Unless, of course, Pakistan chooses, on its end, to cut off the supply. In addition, it pains Virgil to observe that the same doleful dynamic crippled the U.S. military in another war, Iraq.  That is, so long as the Iraqi fighters, both Sunni and Shia, could be resupplied and replenished from neighboring countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, we were never going to win there, either.  Thus we can see: If the American government had truly wished to succeed in Afghanistan and Iraq, it would have thought strategically, in advance of both invasions, about how truly to isolate the insurgents, through whatever possible military or diplomatic means.  And so today we can see: There's no way that we will ever achieve anything close to ""peace with honor"" in Afghanistan without the full and honest cooperation of the Taliban's masters in Pakistan.  Thus we can further see a better course of action in 2017: Just as Nixon went over the heads of the North Vietnamese to cut a deal with China and Russia, so President Trump might wish to go over the heads of the Taliban to cut the needed deal with Pakistan.  That is, the road to peace in Afghanistan runs through Islamabad, not Kabul.  We can also make the same point about Syria.  The solution will not be found in peace talks between combatants who would prefer to be killing each other--and certainly not in ""free elections,"" as Secretary of State John Kerry has laughably suggested.  (Imagine: warring combatants will call a time out to vote!)  Instead, the solution will come from Syria's patrons, Iran and Russia. And finally, a word about Iran.  That country is now firmly embedded in a Eurasian alliance with Russia and China.  Indeed, the Iranians and the Russians are currently negotiating yet another arms deal--this one for a reported $10 billion.  Thus we can see: We aren't going to get anywhere trying to muscle Iran if it has powerful patrons protecting it; in fact, China now has larger economy than the U.S.So if the goal is to deal toughly with Iran, it will require the acquiescence of Beijing and/or Moscow.  Otherwise, as in Vietnam, the U.S. is unlikely to risk a great-power confrontation.  And so gaining that acquiescence to act firmly against Iran, if it can be gained, will take the same sort of direct high-level diplomacy that Nixon and Kissinger used more than four decades ago.  Here, Virgil will venture an informed guess about the near future: President Trump will see world diplomacy as an extension of what he has done best all his life--make deals.  If so, that instinct will serve him well, as he differentiates himself from his failed predecessors and launches a new era of high-level give-and-take.Most likely, a President Trump will treat China and Russia as great powers to be dealt with as potential partners, not as bad actors to be ""reformed"" by America.  That is, it isn't necessary to personally be fond of a leader, or to approve of his or her regime, to nonetheless get things done. In diplomatic terminology, this pragmatic approach is known as realism, or realpolitik, and, in the end, it's the only approach that works.  After all, a leader must deal with the world as it is, not as he or she wishes it to be.   From Lyndon Johnson to George W. Bush to Barack Obama, we've had too many presidents who wished to ""improve"" other nations by force--and it almost never works.  Meanwhile, on the domestic front, Trump faces a situation that also echoes Nixon's.  During the 2016 campaign, Trump's invocation of ""law and order"" recalled the 1968 campaign, and moreover, Trump's hymn to ""the forgotten man"" was in keeping with Nixon's tribute to the ""silent majority."" Meanwhile, as if they are determined to keep this parallelism going, the Democrats today are reprising their McGovern-era leftward lurch.  The likely election of Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) as the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee is one such sign, and so, too, is the reappearance of street protestors (although this time around, many of them seem to be funded by various George Soros front groups).  It's hard to see how the Democrats are on a track to nominate anyone other than a left-winger in 2020.  So that's Trump's trump card: He has a huge electoral advantage, being baked into the political cake right now.Nevertheless, President Trump will still face all the challenges that he pledged to fix during the campaign.  And so even if he is already the favorite to be re-elected, his place in the hearts of the American people, and in the pantheon of history, will be determined by his deeds in the years to come.  Thus as he readies himself for the awesome responsibility of the Oval Office, he might give some thought to the great foreign-policy successes of the last Republican president from New York.  And of course, at the same time, he has surely long ago resolved never to make any of Nixon's many mistakes. 
If, when the chips are down, the world's most powerful nation, the United States of America, acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions throughout the world.

We like livin' right, and bein' freeSIGN UPIn earlier installments, we examined the 2016 elections and their impact on the Democrats.  We have also pondered the likely contours of the 2018 midterm elections and how Republicans might think about solidifying their Congressional majority.  Now, we will take a look, through the prism of history, at the 2020 presidential election.  the 2016 electionsimpact on the Democrats2018 midterm electionsRepublicans might think about solidifying their Congressional majority1. A New Yorker in the White House First, some background: The New York Republican presidential candidate was controversial--that's for sure.  The Democratic establishment disliked him, the media loathed him, and legions of sometimes violent street-protestors hated him.  And yet the American people liked him--after all, they had elected him president.  He had campaigned on popular themes, notably, extrication from foolish foreign entanglements, ""law and order,"" and a general routine to normalcy after eight years of increasingly bizarre left-wing Democratic dominion in the White House.  Still, because the opposition was so intense, his popular-vote percentage, even in victory, was in the mid 40s. Am I describing Donald Trump here?  No, I'm not, at least not yet.  None of us, here on earth, can know the future.  The best we can do is gather clues as to what will come next, and the best source of clues, as Virgil has argued, is the pattern of the past. Virgil has arguedOne such pattern is a sequence of events from the relatively recent past: the 1968 election and the 1972 re-election of our 37th president, Richard Nixon.  Indeed, the parallels are instructive, and so they might serve usefully to illuminate Trump's path in the quadrennium ahead.  Trump, as we all know, was elected this year with a comfortable majority in the electoral college, but with less than a plurality of the popular vote, at last count, 46.7 percent.  So it's no wonder, then, that opponents are already saying that Trump has no true mandate.  And that, of course, is a prelude to the further effort to de-legitimize his presidency.  To be a sure, a determined Trump supporter might be quick to riposte, Give us time.  That is, since Trump has accomplished so much already, by winning as a long-shot candidate, it would be be a serious mistake to underestimate him in the future.   And thus, once again, the battle is joined.  46.7 percentSo with Trump's future in mind, let's learn from our history. Let's consider, as a case study, how Nixon traversed from election squeaker to re-election stomper.  That is, how he went from winning 43 percent of the vote in 1968 to winning almost 61 percent in 1972.  And oh yes, Nixon won an even more spectacular victory in the electoral college--521 electoral votes, the third-largest total in U.S. history.   43 percent of the vote in 196861 percent in 1972Nixon, of course, was originally not a New Yorker at all--he was a  Californian.  He was elected to the U.S. House from the Golden State in 1946, and then to the U.S. Senate in 1950.  Then, after eight years as Dwight Eisenhower's vice president, he suffered defeats in the 1960 presidential election and the 1962 California gubernatorial election.  After that, it was generally believed that he was washed up, politically, especially after he moved to Manhattan to take up a law practice. And so when he did decide to return to the political arena in 1968, few observers thought he could win.  As always, he was reviled by the press as ""Tricky Dick"" and dismissed by the Eastern establishment as an interloper. Yet Nixon was smart.  He could see things other couldn't see: Unlike the liberal Republican elite--epitomized by then-New York State Governor Nelson Rockefeller and New York City Mayor John Lindsay--he could see that middle-class America was horrified by the impact of liberal policies on the nation.  The impact, that is, on both personal safety, on national security, and on general sanity.   Yet at the same time, unlike the conservative ideological elite--epitomized by Barry Goldwater, the badly defeated nominee of 1964, and by William F. Buckley, the publisher of the then-influential National Review--he could see that most Americans were not ideologically right-wing; they had no desire to launch more wars abroad or to repeal the New Deal at home, including such building-block programs as Social Security and the more recently enacted Medicare.  So we can see: In terms of ideology, Nixon wasn't a liberal, but he also wasn't a right-winger; he was a man of the realistic center-right.  Thus Nixon went through the middle to win the 1968 election: He was in the middle of the GOP in the primaries, and he went through the middle of country to win the general election.  And it's in the middle, of course, where victory is most often found--either center-right or, gulp, center-left.  (In 2014, an astute observer here at Breitbart reviewed a memoir about Nixon's comeback, as recalled by no less a first-hand observer than Pat Buchanan.) Nixon's comeback, as recalled by no less a first-hand observer than Pat BuchananAnd yet at the same time, as a matter of personal style, Nixon was always, at the same time, tough-minded.  He liked to call himself a ""nut cutter,"" someone who never hesitated to ""pick off the scab.""  Nixon was probably born tough, and he was made tougher by adversity in his early life, and then he was toughened even more by a searing experience early in his political career.  In the late 1940s, the lawyerly freshman Congressman led the investigation of Alger Hiss, the Soviet spy.  Yes, Hiss was a perjuring communist, but he was also a golden boy of the establishment. Alger Hiss, the Soviet spySo in going after Hiss--in effect, prosecuting this golden member of the elite--Nixon confronted the liberal establishment, which was always strangely eager to cover up communist subversion in its midst.  Thus Nixon put himself in the left's crosshairs, and he would remain their target for the rest of his life.  Not to put too fine a point on it, the establishment despised Nixon, and Nixon despised them right back.  Yet for all his personal edge--his enemies would say, his personal demons--Nixon was, at the same time, a supreme pragmatist.  And so, for example, in the late 1960s, he could see that the then-raging Vietnam War--however well intentioned its origins might have been when launched by his predecessors--had turned into a practical failure. The common phrase back then was ""quagmire.""Thus on January 20, 1969, a new president, promising a new approach, was inaugurated as president, and Nixon's running mate, Spiro Agnew, was sworn in as vice president. Let's consider the many similarities between Nixon's situation then and Trump's situation now: *Unpopular foreign entanglements, courtesy of a Democratic predecessor?  Check. *Slow economy?  Check. *Ferocious Democratic opposition in Congress and around the country? Check.*The smug view of the establishment that the new president was somehow a mistake, even illegitimate?  Check. *Relentlessly hostile media coverage?  Check.*Motley crews of sometimes violent protestors everywhere? Check. Nixon knew well--perhaps too well--that he had lots of enemies.  Yet even so, pragmatist that he was, he set about solving major problems facing the country.  And how he went about that problem-solving is instructive, even to this day.  Indeed, it's even possible that Nixonian pragmatism might anticipate  the sort of master deal-making that Trump loves.  So as part of our case study, let's focus on the biggest policy challenge that Nixon confronted.  2. Vietnam as a Foreign Policy Issue and as a Political IssueThe hottest controversy in the country in 1969 was the Vietnam War, which the 37th president had ""inherited"" from the 36th president, Lyndon B. Johnson.   As noted, Nixon could see that the war was unwinnable, because under the palsied ""rules of engagement"" established by Johnson, the North Vietnamese could endlessly resupply and replenish their offensive forces in South Vietnam.  Moreover, the the Chinese, and the Soviets, could endlessly resupply North Vietnam. Yet by 1969, with more than half-a-million troops in the jungle, the American public was in no mood to consider further escalation as a way of possibly winning the war.  Such escalation would have meant carrying the fight directly into North Vietnam, with an eye toward disrupting those crucial supply lines.  Such an escalation, of course, would have brought the risk of a direct confrontation with China and the USSR, and thus possibly even World War Three.  It was clear to everyone that South Vietnam simply wasn't worth that sort of planetary gamble.  After all, the war had been sold to the American public as a limited war, not as an unlimited war. So again, President Nixon could see that Vietnam had to end with something short of all-out American victory.  And in fact, the collective national decision to exit Vietnam had been made the year before, in 1968, in the wake of the Tet Offensive.  Indeed, back in May 1968, under the Johnson administration, peace talks in Paris had commenced.  However, those those talks proved to be their own kind of diplomatic quagmire, as the negotiators spent months wrangling, for example, over the shape of the conference table. Why this bogging?  Because the Hanoi government, hardened by two decades of fighting and confident of ultimate victory, was simply in no mood to negotiate anything other than American and South Vietnamese capitulation.   Yet for his part, Nixon, joined by most--although by no means all--Americans, believed that America couldn't simply cut and run.  That is, we couldn't just evacuate our troops from South Vietnam, Dunkirk-style.  Painful as the war was, we still needed to maintain our national prestige and strategic credibility; we needed to achieve, as Nixon had pledged during the campaign, ""peace with honor."" Thus Nixon launched a three-track strategy: The first track was the slow and careful de-escalation of U.S. participation in the fighting.  The second track was the seeking out a new diplomatic solution to end the fighting through talks at the bargaining table.The third track was the handling of the radical anti-war protestors who wanted, as they bragged, to ""bring the war home.""  As we shall see, the protestors, often violent, played into Nixon's hands.bring the war homeStepping back, we can gather that Nixon had a challenging task--but then, being president is never easy.  So now let's look at each of these three tracks in turn. First, the de-escalation track.  This was hardly an ideal approach, because it meant continuing a war, albeit at a tapering pace, that few Americans believed in.  And yet for reasons of Grand Strategy, Nixon had little choice.  Yes, Vietnam was a terrible predicament for America--and a tragedy for the GIs doing the fighting and the dying--but Nixon had to deal with the world as it was, not as he wished to be.  And that meant carrying on the fight. As Nixon said in a speech on April 30, 1970, the US had no choice but to gut it out, lest it be dramatically humiliated in the eyes of the world: speech on April 30, 1970If, when the chips are down, the world's most powerful nation, the United States of America, acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions throughout the world. We can further observe, with sorrow, that sometimes, as a matter of bitter necessity, good leadership means presiding over bad outcomes.  (It helped, however, that Nixon had himself served in the Pacific Theater during World War Two--nobody could accuse him of being a ""chickenhawk."") So from the perspective of nearly half a century, one can best say this:  If you see a Vietnam vet, give him a hug, because without a doubt, he got a raw deal.  In the words of the famous Tennyson poem about another misbegotten but nonetheless heroic military operation, ""Theirs not to reason why/ Theirs but to do and die."" Tennyson poemSecond, the diplomatic track.  Nixon could see, as Johnson could not, that direct negotiations with the North Vietnamese were never going to succeed.  So Nixon and his top foreign-policy aide, Henry Kissinger, hit upon a masterful stratagem that didn't seem to have occurred to the Johnson administration: They would go over the heads of the North Vietnamese and parley, instead, with Hanoi's ultimate masters in Beijing and Moscow. To be sure, these negotiations ""at the summit"" were long and torturous, especially since we did not, in those days, have diplomatic relations with China.  Yet during Nixon's first term, U.S.-China relations began to thaw, culminating in Nixon's historic trip to Beijing in February 1972.  And that historic journey was followed by a less-remembered, but also vitally important, visit to Moscow in May 1972.  In the case of both capitals, it was the first-ever trip by an American president.   In those high-stakes meetings, Nixon and Kissinger worked out a new understanding with both the Chinese and the Russians--namely, that in the near future, the U.S. would bomb North Vietnam with an intensity that had never been seen before.  This was a big deal because, in the past, the U.S. had held off such bombing out of fear that American ordnance would kill Chinese or Russian nationals on the ground in North Vietnam--of whom there were plenty.  As noted earlier, the larger fear was that such escalation could escalate into nuclear war.Yet once Nixon's new understanding with China and Russia had been worked out, the U.S. could proceed militarily against North Vietnam.  Hence the extremely intense U.S. bombing campaigns of 1972 were met, not with Chinese or Russian outrage, but, rather, with aloof indifference.  That was the difference Nixon's diplomacy had achieved.  The message to Hanoi was clear: You're on your own, now.  So you'd better negotiate in good faith with the U.S. government.The result was the Paris Peace Accords of January 1973.  And so, after a dozen years of fighting and more than 58,000 Americans dead, the war was finally over.   Unlike some more recent recipients, Kissinger had actually earned his Nobel Peace Prize.  To be sure, the deal was not completely satisfactory, but then in this world, what deal ever is?   Still, it's more than likely that the Paris Accords would have held firm, at least for a long time, were it not for the fact that Nixon was forced to resign, as a result of Watergate, in 1974.  Once Nixon was gone, the dramatically empowered Democrats--who, as a party, had flipped, going from hawkish to dovish during the Nixon years--voted in Congress to abandon South Vietnam.  Thus in 1975, the relentless North Vietnamese--bolstered, once again, by China and the Soviet Union--were finally triumphant. So we can look back and be reminded of just how consequential the Watergate scandal was: Most obviously, it ended the Nixon presidency, but, in addition, it doomed the South Vietnamese and gave the USSR a geopolitical momentum that lasted throughout the 1970s, till the coming of Ronald Reagan.   And now we can pause to consider how Trump might draw inspiration from Nixon's geopolitical genius.  We might also note that in comparison, the Watergate scandal, serious as it was at the time, will be remembered as a mere unfortunate footnote. Third, the handling-the-protestors track. In the late '60s and early '70s, many millions of Americans honorably and decently opposed the Vietnam War.  In fact, opponents of the war were a majority.  However, within this anti-war majority, major splits emerged as to how to extricate Uncle Sam from the conflict.  As noted, Nixon had said that we shouldn't just turn tail, that we should seek an honorable way out--and most Americans agreed with him.Yet for a hard core of anti-war protestors, any delay was unacceptable.  And so they took to the campus quads and to the streets demanding, ""Get Out Now!"" Moreover, a considerable number of noisy anti-war protestors went further than that--much further.  They took their activism around the bend, as it were, morphing into full-blown anti-Americans.  They were haters, and they delighted in burning the American flag to prove it.  These angry people proclaimed themselves to be ""revolutionaries,"" forming themselves into groups such as Students for a Democratic Society and the Weather Underground.Of course, all this craziness was appalling to most Americans.  And so for every self-identified member of ""Woodstock Nation,"" there were a hundred who continued to play by the rules, pay their taxes, and serve their country. Thus we can see an emerging political dynamic: The antics of the hippies, and the crimes of the Weathermen, did not, as they said back then, play well in Peoria.  And for his part, Nixon, crafty politician that he was, soon realized that he could take advantage of the situation--that is, use the protestors as a foil.  Nixon made the case to Middle America: Who should run the country: The elected president, along with other constitutional officers, or these radical protestors?  The opinion numbers associated with that dichotomy weren't even close: Nixon had the greater majority with him, even among moderate and conservative Democrats (there were plenty back then) who didn't like Nixon. Yes, Nixon skillfully played his hand.  In a televised speech to the nation on November 30, 1969, he asked the ""silent majority"" to stand with him, and with America as we had known it--and not with the radicals. silent majorityThat phrase, ""silent majority,"" was used only once in the speech, but it had an electric effect across the country.  The folks at home knew that Nixon was talking to them, just as FDR had three decades earlier, in his famous fireside chats. fireside chatsMeanwhile, that same year, the popular country and western song, Merle Haggard's Okie from Muskogee, also struck a resonant chord in the popular culture: Thus a new center-right consciousness was born.  And at the end of 1969, Time magazine named ""The Middle Americans"" as its Man and Woman of the Year.Man and Woman of the YearThus politically, Nixon was on his way.  He was the leader of what was called ""the emerging Republican majority.""  And unlike, say, an ideologue such as Goldwater, Nixon was careful not to antagonize public opinion: In office, he was no enemy of labor unions, and he even increased Social Security by initiating an annual inflation-based Cost Of Living Allowance for retirees.  (A smart take on the making of the Nixon majority can be found here at Breitbart.)the emerging Republican majorityhereIn addition, beginning in 1969, Nixon unleashed Vice President Spiro Agnew to attack the biased media.  Agnew's famous volleys of angry alliteration--referring to the pundits, for example, as ""nattering nabobs of negativism,"" were political gold, and became part of political folklore.  Indeed, Agnew's adversarial stance has provided the template that's been used ever since by Republican/conservative critics of the MSM.  (In 1973, Agnew was forced to resign because of a personal financial scandal, unrelated to Watergate.) Yet because of his personality, as well as the polarized opinion of that era, Nixon himself was never truly popular, and after June 1972, the Watergate scandal, avidly stoked by the Democrats and the media, began to take its toll. And yet at the same time, Nixon benefited from the nuttiness of his enemies.  As Virgil has described, the Democrats, swept up in anti-war/countercultural enthusiasm, veered way to the left.  And so their presidential nominee in 1972 was the hopelessly unelectable Sen. George McGovern. Virgil has describedDespite the bleeding from Watergate, Nixon carried 49 states that November, garnering 60.7  percent of the popular vote.  Considering that he had won just 43.4 percent of the vote in 1968, that was a 17-point jump.  In fact, it was, and still is, the largest percentage increase for a single president in U.S. history--not bad!   And oh, by the way, in '72 Nixon won 73.7 percent of the vote of Merle Haggard's proud Okies in the Sooner State.3. The Nixon Lesson: Implications for TrumpTrump, born in 1946, obviously remembers all this history--he was there to see it. Today, as the soon-to-be 45th president prepares to take power, the U.S. doesn't face a foreign military crisis as severe as was Vietnam in Nixon's day.  And yet still, there are plenty of crises that could benefit from fresh strategic thinking.  We can start with the grim situation in Afghanistan and Iraq, which count as the two mini-Vietnams that Trump has inherited from Barack Obama. But first, let's take a moment to consider the challenge of waging a counterinsurgency, whether it be in Vietnam in the '60s and '70s, or in  Afghanistan and Iraq in the '00s and '10s. Here's a general rule for policymakers: If the counter-insurgency is aimed at an insurgency that can be resupplied and replenished from a contiguous country, it's highly unlikely that the counter-insurgency will prevail.  To put this point more bluntly, the counter-insurgent force must isolate the insurgents--or else, admit defeat.  We can add that failure to isolate the insurgents was the mistake that the U.S. made in Afghanistan.  Yes, it was easy enough for American forces to occupy Kabul in 2001, thus ejecting the Taliban regime.  And yet in the years after, as the American mission morphed from legitimate punitive expedition in the wake of 9/11 to an amorphous goal of ""nation building,"" the original successful mission became, sadly, a ""mission impossible.""  That is, so long as the Taliban, scattered as it was, could be resupplied through Afghanistan's porous border with Pakistan, it was never going to be defeated--at least not by the U.S., with its finicky rules of engagement.  And since Pakistan, population 180 million, has close ethnic- and religious ties to most of the Afghan people, there will never be a shortage of new Taliban fighters.  Unless, of course, Pakistan chooses, on its end, to cut off the supply. In addition, it pains Virgil to observe that the same doleful dynamic crippled the U.S. military in another war, Iraq.  That is, so long as the Iraqi fighters, both Sunni and Shia, could be resupplied and replenished from neighboring countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, we were never going to win there, either.  Thus we can see: If the American government had truly wished to succeed in Afghanistan and Iraq, it would have thought strategically, in advance of both invasions, about how truly to isolate the insurgents, through whatever possible military or diplomatic means.  And so today we can see: There's no way that we will ever achieve anything close to ""peace with honor"" in Afghanistan without the full and honest cooperation of the Taliban's masters in Pakistan.  Thus we can further see a better course of action in 2017: Just as Nixon went over the heads of the North Vietnamese to cut a deal with China and Russia, so President Trump might wish to go over the heads of the Taliban to cut the needed deal with Pakistan.  That is, the road to peace in Afghanistan runs through Islamabad, not Kabul.  We can also make the same point about Syria.  The solution will not be found in peace talks between combatants who would prefer to be killing each other--and certainly not in ""free elections,"" as Secretary of State John Kerry has laughably suggested.  (Imagine: warring combatants will call a time out to vote!)  Instead, the solution will come from Syria's patrons, Iran and Russia. Secretary of State John Kerry has laughably suggestedAnd finally, a word about Iran.  That country is now firmly embedded in a Eurasian alliance with Russia and China.  Indeed, the Iranians and the Russians are currently negotiating yet another arms deal--this one for a reported $10 billion.  Thus we can see: We aren't going to get anywhere trying to muscle Iran if it has powerful patrons protecting it; in fact, China now has larger economy than the U.S.arms dealSo if the goal is to deal toughly with Iran, it will require the acquiescence of Beijing and/or Moscow.  Otherwise, as in Vietnam, the U.S. is unlikely to risk a great-power confrontation.  And so gaining that acquiescence to act firmly against Iran, if it can be gained, will take the same sort of direct high-level diplomacy that Nixon and Kissinger used more than four decades ago.  Here, Virgil will venture an informed guess about the near future: President Trump will see world diplomacy as an extension of what he has done best all his life--make deals.  If so, that instinct will serve him well, as he differentiates himself from his failed predecessors and launches a new era of high-level give-and-take.Most likely, a President Trump will treat China and Russia as great powers to be dealt with as potential partners, not as bad actors to be ""reformed"" by America.  That is, it isn't necessary to personally be fond of a leader, or to approve of his or her regime, to nonetheless get things done. In diplomatic terminology, this pragmatic approach is known as realism, or realpolitik, and, in the end, it's the only approach that works.  After all, a leader must deal with the world as it is, not as he or she wishes it to be.   From Lyndon Johnson to George W. Bush to Barack Obama, we've had too many presidents who wished to ""improve"" other nations by force--and it almost never works.  Meanwhile, on the domestic front, Trump faces a situation that also echoes Nixon's.  During the 2016 campaign, Trump's invocation of ""law and order"" recalled the 1968 campaign, and moreover, Trump's hymn to ""the forgotten man"" was in keeping with Nixon's tribute to the ""silent majority."" Meanwhile, as if they are determined to keep this parallelism going, the Democrats today are reprising their McGovern-era leftward lurch.  The likely election of Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) as the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee is one such sign, and so, too, is the reappearance of street protestors (although this time around, many of them seem to be funded by various George Soros front groups).  It's hard to see how the Democrats are on a track to nominate anyone other than a left-winger in 2020.  George Soros front groupsSo that's Trump's trump card: He has a huge electoral advantage, being baked into the political cake right now.Nevertheless, President Trump will still face all the challenges that he pledged to fix during the campaign.  And so even if he is already the favorite to be re-elected, his place in the hearts of the American people, and in the pantheon of history, will be determined by his deeds in the years to come.  Thus as he readies himself for the awesome responsibility of the Oval Office, he might give some thought to the great foreign-policy successes of the last Republican president from New York.  And of course, at the same time, he has surely long ago resolved never to make any of Nixon's many mistakes. "

Alito said part of the consideration that will go into gun rights decisions should be ""What would Scalia do?""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAlito said the same question should be asked in arriving at all decisions regarding matters of liberty and government overreach.According to The Washington Post, Alito summed up the such matters as ""constitutional fault lines,"" saying, ""Sometimes the earth starts to tremor and people get worried about what's coming.""He pointed to District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) as one of the times when the tremors could be felt. Americans watched and waited and the court ruled that ""the Second Amendment actually means what it says,"" according to Alito. It reaffirmed that the right to keep and bear arms is an individual right possessed by Americans from birth.Alito cited Justice Stephen G. Breyer's dissent in Heller, which he said ""provides a road map for denaturing Heller without actually overruling it."" He said such a guide for gutting the ruling is alarming, as is the opposition Democrat Senators have shown via their ""[willingness] to amend the Constitution to overturn the court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, which held that restrictions on corporate and union political spending violated free-speech rights.""He rhetorically asked, ""What would that amendment do? It would have the effect of granting greater free-speech rights to an elite group -- those who control the media -- than to everybody else.""Alito said he spoke to a Federalist Society chapter at Columbia University and was given a t-shirt with the letters, ""WWSD?""

Professors are responsible for preparing these students for war.Students GuardAt the Ukraine's Taras Shevchenko National University, a safe space does exist on campus. Students often will stand there, shoulder-to-shoulder, in complete silence. The space is reserved for photos and tributes to students who, answering the nation's call to duty, failed to return.For Ukrainian college students, no other safe space exists.Tom Brokaw described America's World War II generation as our greatest. Sadly, most members from that generation have now left us. But, it is probably just as well, for they undoubtedly would be horrified to know their sacrifices have given rise to a pampered generation of ""bubble children"" unable to cope with life's basic realities."

""Rhee, who has identified as a Democrat throughout her career, is a strong supporter of school choice (including vouchers), which appears to be the top K-12 priority for Trump.""Rhee, however, who was D.C. schools chancellor from 2007 to 2010, is a Common Core supporter, a fact that does not mesh with Trump's stated goal of finally getting rid of any federal mechanisms that are keeping the boondoggle going.The Federalist's Joy Pullmann writes that Rhee ""doesn't fit Trump at all.""""For one, she's highly skeptical of school choice,"" Pullmann says, and continues:She strongly supports charter schools, a good but highly managed government alternative to traditional public schools, and prominently reversed her opposition to vouchers in 2013. Yet she still supports a highly regulated version of vouchers driven by applying the tests to them that public schools use, which undercuts their very premise. We don't want to use vouchers to mold private schools into the public schools whose failure justifies vouchers in the first place, but to provide diversity of parent choice in education. That requires light regulation.""There are a lot of people out there who sort of believe, the free market, let the free market reign, the market will correct itself -- give every kid a backpack with their money in it and let them choose wherever they want to go,"" Rhee said in a 2012 interview with Education Week. ""I don't believe in that model at all.""""Instead, she supports highly limited and highly regulated voucher programs just for poor families, not all taxpayers,"" says Pullmann.Pullmann observes the all-important distinction among methods of bringing about school choice, and vouchers are a means that have been shown to create the greatest amount of regulation to private and other schools that agree to accept them for low-income students.A recent Education Next poll shows that while overall support for school choice is high in the United States, support for the use of vouchers to access choice programs has declined.""Program design matters,"" Lindsey Burke, education fellow at Heritage Foundation, told Breitbart News. ""The poll results found a drop in support for school vouchers, which could reflect recent experiences in states that have heavily regulated their school voucher programs, leading, paradoxically - as the regulations were promulgated in the name of accountability - to lower participation among high quality private schools.""In a 2010 study at the Cato Institute, Andrew Coulson found that voucher programs are more likely to ""suffocate the very markets to which they aim to expand access"" because state funds--which invariably invite state regulation--are directly transferred, in the form of vouchers, to parents to spend in an alternate education setting.""Instead, tax credit scholarships and education savings accounts are fast becoming the more popular means to create school choice.But the possible consideration of Rhee as U.S. education secretary raises other concerns.Rhee is married to current Sacramento Mayor and former NBA star Kevin Johnson, who was the focus of considerable scandal in 2015.In a piece titled ""The Comeuppance of Creepy Obama Crony Kevin Johnson,"" conservative author Michelle Malkin highlighted published reports by the Sacramento News & Review on Johnson's alleged ""use of public resources for personal gain."" Sports site Deadspin had also slammed Johnson for allegations of ""sleazy financial dealings and personal perversities.""Malkin continued, ""Among Deadspin's damaging scoops: an exclusive interview with accuser Mandi Koba and video of her 1996 police interview in which the then-17-year-old victim graphically described repeated sexual molestation by Johnson, then 29 and a star member of the Phoenix Suns.""Having reported on similar behavior by Johnson in 2011, Malkin writes that then-federal inspector General Gerald Walpin of the Corporation for National and Community Service uncovered other examples of ""inappropriate contact"" between Johnson and several high school students while also probing into misuse of about $1 million in AmeriCorps funds at St. HOPE Academy of California, the charter school organization founded by Johnson.Malkin reported Walpin concluded Johnson used AmeriCorps funds for his own political and personal purposes. Additionally:Johnson's attorney, Kevin Hiestand, approached at least one of the (St. HOPE) students describing himself only as ""a friend of Johnson's,"" and ""basically asked me to keep quiet."" She had complained to St. HOPE officials that Johnson groped her sexually after instructing her to grade papers with him in her apartment. According to her interview with Walpin's investigators, ""about one week later, Kevin Johnson offered her $1,000 a month until the end of the program, which she refused to accept.""Walpin's office also found that Rhee, who was Johnson's fiance at the time and a St. HOPE board member, ""played the role of a fixer, doing 'damage control'"" for Johnson, Malkin wrote.""The White House, which so ostentatiously crusades against sexual harassment and the War on Women, looked the other way,"" she wrote. ""The Obamas and Johnsons are close pals. Reminder: Johnson donated the maximum individual amount to Obama for America, campaigned across the country for Obama in 2008, and bragged to California media during his mayoral run about his friendship and access to both Barack and Michelle Obama.""Rhee now chairs the board of St. HOPE Public Schools, the charter school organization her husband started.She strongly supports charter schools, a good but highly managed government alternative to traditional public schools, and prominently reversed her opposition to vouchers in 2013. Yet she still supports a highly regulated version of vouchers driven by applying the tests to them that public schools use, which undercuts their very premise.

Obama bemoaned the emergence of mainstream media outlets, such as Drudge and Breitbart and Facebook-shared conservations, that do not take their orders from establishment politicians, experts and institutions.What frustrated Obama and his staff [in the 2016 campaign] was the knowledge that, in large measure, they were reaching their own people but no further. They spoke to the networks and the major cable outlets, the major papers and the mainstream Web sites, and, in an attempt to find people ""where they are,"" forums such as Bill Maher's and Samantha Bee's late-night cable shows, and Marc Maron's podcast. But they would never reach the collective readerships of Breitbart News, the Drudge Report, WND, Newsmax, InfoWars, and lesser-knowns like Western Journalism--not to mention the closed loop of peer-to-peer right-wing rumor-mongering.... That marked a decisive change from previous political eras, [Obama] maintained. ""Ideally, in a democracy, everybody would agree that climate change is the consequence of man-made behavior, because that's what ninety-nine per cent of scientists tell us,"" he said. ""And then we would have a debate about how to fix it. That's how, in the seventies, eighties, and nineties, you had Republicans supporting the Clean Air Act and you had a market-based fix for acid rain rather than a command-and-control approach. So you'd argue about means, but there was a baseline of facts that we could all work off of. And now we just don't have that"" ...""I have complete confidence in the American people--that if I can have a conversation with them they'll choose what's right. At an emotional level, they want to do the right thing if they have the information."" And yet in an age of filter bubbles and social-media silos, he knew, the ""information"" that reached people was increasingly shaped by what they wanted to be true. And that was no longer in his hands or anyone else's.Obama's assessment of his own powers of persuasion may not be fully justified. For example, he has completely failed to persuade Americans that his vision of high immigration and low wages is preferable to low-immigration, high wage alternative. He also failed to persuade Americans to support his government directed healthcare system or to support Hillary Clinton in 2016.Remnick is already on record complaining that his own elite publication was sidelined by Breitbart in the 2016 election.Surely, Breitbart News, a site of vile conspiracies, could not become for millions a source of news and mainstream opinion... the information loop had been shattered. On Facebook, articles in the traditional, fact-based press look the same as articles from the conspiratorial alt-right media. Spokesmen for the unspeakable now have access to huge audiences. This was the cauldron, with so much misogynistic language, that helped to demean and destroy Clinton. The alt-right press was the purveyor of constant lies, propaganda, and conspiracy theories that Trump used as the oxygen of his campaign...But despair is no answer. To combat authoritarianism, to call out lies, to struggle honorably and fiercely in the name of American ideals--that is what is left to do. That is all there is to do.Read Remnick's interview here.

Jeff Sessions was selected by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as his Attorney General, putting him in line to become the top law and order position of the Trump administration.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHere are six things you need to know about Jeff Sessions:1: The First U.S. Senator to Endorse Donald Trump for PresidentSessions was already familiar with Trump when the developer came to Capitol Hill to testify about proposed renovations to the U.N. headquarters in 2005. Trump argued that the proposed $1.5 billion cost was outrageous estimating that the actual cost could be done with $700 million.Sessions called Trump's testimony ""a breath of fresh air"" and thanked him for showing Congress how to save money.In September 2015, Trump traveled to Washington D.C. to attend a rally against the Iran deal. He met with Sessions afterward, prompting speculation that the veteran senator was open to endorsing Trump.In February 2016, Sessions appeared at a rally with Trump in Mobile, Alabama and endorsed him for president, a blow for his senate colleague Ted Cruz who was also running for president.""I told Donald Trump this isn't a campaign, this is a movement,"" Sessions said. ""Look at what's happening. The American people are not happy with their government.""In August 2016, Sessions wore a 'Make Mexico Great Again Also' hat while Trump outlined his tough positions on illegal immigration.Great again. pic.twitter.com/34TJbUAz96-- Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) November 18, 20162: Leading opponent of amnesty:Sen. Jeff Sessions is undoubtedly the biggest opponent of amnesty for illegal immigrants.Sessions repeatedly denounced establishment members of both parties who worked hand in hand with top members of the business community as ""Masters of the Universe"" who worked behind closed doors to plot the legalization for illegal immigrants in Congress.He has a drawing of He-man and Battle Cat hanging in his office together with a transcript of remarks he made in 2007, after delivering a speech denouncing President George W. Bush's efforts for immigration reform.He reused his ""Masters of the Universe"" talking points again in 2013, opposing the amnesty pursued by the Gang of Eight, an effort that was widely supported by Silicon Valley tech giants including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.3. Led populist revolt against TPPSessions was adamantly against the Transpacific Partnership trade deal, a deal that most Republicans were happy to work with Obama to get passed.""For too long the United States has entered in the trade deals, on the promise of economic bounty only to see workers impoverished, industries disappear, manufacturing jobs declined,"" Sessions said in a speech against a vote to give Obama authority to negotiate the trade deal.Sessions was one of only five Republican senators who voted against giving Obama the authority to negotiate the deal.4. Leftist Attacks:When President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions in 1985 to serve as a federal judge in Alabama, Democrats were ready. Sessions was accused of being racially insensitive, and unfit to serve, as former employees testified against him.Sen. Ted Kennedy denounced Sessions as ""a throwback to a shameful era which I know both black and white Americans thought was in our past.""Moderate Republican senator Arlen Specter later admitted that his vote against Sessions was ""a mistake.""""I have since found that Sen. Sessions is egalitarian,"" he told reporters in 2009.5. Record of supporting civil rightsThe Trump campaign reacted on Friday to accusations that Sessions was too controversial a nominee.They pointed out that as attorney general in Alabama, Sessions filed desegregation lawsuits and supported the 30-year extension of the Civil Rights Act. The Trump team noted that Sessions voted to confirm Attorney General Eric Holder and proposed awarding the Congressional Medal of Honor to Rosa Parks.6. Criminal Justice reform and the Crack Cocaine thing:During confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice nominee Sonia Sotomayor, Sessions told one of the witnesses that he was supportive of lowering criminal penalties for users of crack cocaine.""Sen. Leahy and I are talking, during these hearings, we're going to do that crack cocaine thing that you and I have talked about before,"" he said as the room erupted in laughter. After Sessions realized how funny his statement sounded, he grinned and corrected the record.In 2010, the Washington Post endorsed a bill proposed by Sessions and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin to do exactly that.""Assistant Senate Majority Leader Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) deserve credit for hammering out the compromise and shepherding the bill through the Senate,"" the editorial noted.Great again. pic.twitter.com/34TJbUAz96

While Bannon seems to relish the left seeing him as ""Darth Vader"" or ""Satan,"" he describes himself as ""Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom The Hollywood Reporter:What he seems to have carried from a boyhood in a blue-collar, union and Democratic family in Norfolk, Va., and through his tour of the American establishment, is an unreconstructed sense of class awareness, or bitterness -- or betrayal. The Democratic Party betrayed its working-man roots, just as Hillary Clinton betrayed the long-time Clinton connection -- Bill Clinton's connection -- to the working man. ""The Clinton strength,"" he says, ""was to play to people without a college education. High school people. That's how you win elections."" And, likewise, the Republican party would come to betray its working-man constituency forged under Reagan. In sum, the working man was betrayed by the establishment, or what he dismisses as the ""donor class.""To say that he sees this donor class -- which in his telling is also ""ascendant America,"" e.g. the elites, as well as ""the metrosexual bubble"" that encompasses cosmopolitan sensibilities to be found as far and wide as Shanghai, London's Chelsea, Hollywood and the Upper West Side -- as a world apart, is an understatement. In his view, there's hardly a connection between this world and its opposite -- fly-over America, left-behind America, downwardly mobile America -- hardly a common language.This is partly why he regards the liberal characterization of himself as socially vile, as the politically incorrect devil incarnate, as laughable -- and why he is stoutly unapologetic. They --liberals and media -- don't understand what he is saying, or why, or to whom. Breitbart, with its casual provocations -- lists of its varied incitements (among them: the conservative writer David Horowitz referred to conservative pundit Brill Kristol as a ""renegade Jew,"" and the site delighting in headlines the likes of ""Trannies 49Xs Higher HIV Rate"" and ""Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy"") were in hot exchange after the election among appalled Democrats -- is as obtuse to the liberal-donor-globalist class as Lena Dunham might be to the out-of-work workingman class. And this, in the Bannon view, is all part of the profound misunderstanding that led liberals to believe that Donald Trump's mouth would doom him, instead of elect him.Bannon, arguably, is one of the people most at the battle line of the great American divide -- and one of the people to have most clearly seen this battle line.He absolutely -- mockingly -- rejects the idea that this is a racial line. ""I'm not a white nationalist, I'm a nationalist. I'm an economic nationalist,"" he tells me. ""The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f--ed over. If we deliver--"" by ""we"" he means the Trump White House ""--we'll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we'll govern for 50 years. That's what the Democrats missed, they were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. It's not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about.""In a nascent administration that seems, at best, random in its beliefs, Bannon can seem to be not just a focused voice, but almost a messianic one:""Like [Andrew] Jackson's populism, we're going to build an entirely new political movement,"" he says. ""It's everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy. I'm the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. With negative interest rates throughout the world, it's the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up. We're just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution -- conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.""Read the rest of the story here.SIGN UP"

Mike Pompeo (R-KS) as CIA director merits exploring some interesting facts about the congressman.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER1. Pompeo, 52, graduated first in his class at West Point in 1986, with a major in mechanical engineering. His Army service included patrolling the Berlin Wall before it came down. ""My generation was the tail end of the Cold War,"" Pompeo said during a 2014 visit to Kansas State, where he discussed the battle against the Islamic State. He added:Before that, you had Nazism. This will ultimately be this generation's fight, this battle where radical Islam continues to want to take on the West in fundamental ways, in the same way these other ideologies wanted to do before. I think we're going to be at this for a while. We ought to be vigorous and thoughtful and effective in the way we respond.In a 2011 profile of soldiers in Congress published by the Association of the United States Army, Pompeo is quoted as saying, ""I still remember the first acronym I learned, BLUF: Bottom Line Up Front. I still try to communicate that way. No reason to dance around getting to the point.""2. He continued his education at Harvard Law School after completing his active-duty Army service in 1991, and was an editor at the Harvard Law Review. He worked as a lawyer in Washington for several years, at the powerful law firm Williams & Connolly.""When he arrived here after graduating first in his class at West Point and serving with distinction as an Army officer, he was bent on going into politics,"" law professor Mary Ann Glendon recalled in a 2011 interview, continuing:When he went into business instead, I felt real regret to see yet another young person of great integrity and ability swerve from his original path. But in fact he didn't. Mike waited until he and his wife, Susan, had raised their son and assured a sound financial footing for the family. This past November, he was elected to the U.S. Congress from the 4th District of Kansas.3. As Professor Glendon said in her interview, Pompeo did not go into politics immediately after his time as a D.C. lawyer. Instead, he returned to his hometown in Orange County, California, and founded a company called Thayer Aerospace with some friends from his West Point days. After serving as Thayer CEO for more than a decade, he sold Thayer and became president of Sentry International, a Wichita-based company that sells oil field equipment.One of the minor investors in Thayer was Koch Venture Capital. Given the Left's deranged obsession with the Koch brothers as the focus of big-money evil in modern politics, we can expect to hear a great deal about this, even though Pompeo has said their investment was less than 2 percent of Thayer's total funding. There will also be some caterwauling about Koch support for Rep. Pompeo's congressional campaign. Pompeo wrote an op-ed in 2012 chastising Democrats for ""harassing the Koch brothers,"" specifically on the Keystone XL pipeline issue. ""The Democrats' obsession with the Kochs as a political target is, indeed, additional evidence of a truly Nixonian approach to politics,"" he said.4. Given this background, it is no surprise that Pomepo serves on both the House Intelligence and House Energy and Commerce committees. He was also appointed to the House Select Benghazi Committee. 5. Perhaps surprisingly, given his business background, Pompeo's net worth is rated below average by various public interest sites - 69 percent below the average member of Congress, according to InsideGov, which pegs his net worth at $345,011.6. Pompeo was elected to Congress in 2010 on the Tea Party wave and is now serving his third term. He was, at one point, seen as a dark-horse challenger to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) for Speaker of the House. There were also rumors he was considering a Senate run.""While we have had our share of strong differences - principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi - I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a C.I.A. director,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), ranking Democrat on House Intelligence Committee, said in praise of Pompeo on Friday morning.7. Pompeo was originally a supporter of Senator Marco Rubio's (R-FL) presidential bid, moving his support to Trump after it became clear he would be the GOP nominee. He is close to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, having served with him when Pence was in Congress. During a breakfast for Kansas delegates to the Republican National Convention in July, he called Pence a ""friend and mentor"" whose ""values ... are very much like those of us in Kansas.""""You have seen him make good decisions in his business life, his family life - with his children, so I am excited for a commander in chief who fearlessly puts America out in front,"" Pompeo said of Trump at the same event.8. He is a strong critic of the Iran nuclear deal, remarking just Thursday on Twitter that he is ""looking forward to rolling back this disastrous deal with the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism."" Among other actions, he has sponsored bills to increase sanctions on Iran and to require the Obama administration to investigate Iran for violating the Geneva Convention in its treatment of ten captured American sailors last year. He also unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a visa to visit Iran and observe its most recent round of elections.9. Pompeo has supported online surveillance programs. He has said former NSA contractor Edward Snowden should be ""brought back from Russia and given due process."" He stated, ""I think the proper outcome would be that he would be given a death sentence"" because he ""put friends of mine, friends of yours who serve in the military today at enormous risk because of the information he stole and then released to foreign powers.""10. Pompeo has been accused of ""Islamophobia"" by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, for statements such as this one, made after the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013: ""When the most devastating terrorist attacks on America in the last 20 years come overwhelmingly from people of a single faith, and are performed in the name of that faith, a special obligation falls on those that are the leaders of that faith.""  He continued, ""Instead of responding, silence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts and more importantly still, in those that may well follow.""Before that, you had Nazism. This will ultimately be this generation's fight, this battle where radical Islam continues to want to take on the West in fundamental ways, in the same way these other ideologies wanted to do before.

And they will never forgive you for it.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has been forced to walk back false claims that Bannon -- now the incoming White House Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor -- is an antisemite. It has also dropped the false claim that Breitbart is the ""premier"" alt-right website.But the ADL launched those defamatory claims and let them fester for days, while journalists busied themselves scaring the American public and slandering Breitbart readers as ""white supremacists and anti-Semites.""The bigger issue is that they cannot accept that Bannon, and Breitbart, understand the American public better than they do. They are seeking their revenge -- not just against Breitbart News itself, but against our growing audience.That is an audience of 45 million unique visitors to Breitbart.com over the past 30 days. That is an audience that likely includes many of Trump's 61 million voters. And it is an audience that includes Democrats, too -- those who demand reform within their own party.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) -- the victim of Democrats' election-rigging -- tweeted before the election: ""I do not believe that most of the people who are thinking about voting for Mr. Trump are racist or sexist ... most are people who are hurting.""Left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore, who warned Democrats about Trump's appeal in the Upper Midwest, told MSNBC after the election: ""They're not racists. They twice voted for a man whose middle name is Hussein. That's the America we live in.""Liberal intellectual Thomas Frank laid the blame for Trump's victory at the feet of the media, who pretended ""[w]orking-class people weren't supporting Trump. And if they were, it was only because they were botched humans. Racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the Republican candidate.""Frank added: ""The fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus. They chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them.""The media have learned nothing from their defeat. They are recycling the exact same false allegations that were used against Bannon, and Trump, during the election -- and which voters ignored at the polls.On Sunday morning, CNN's Brian Stelter, host of Reliable Sources, called for ""serious media soul-searching"" because viewers were ""having a very hard time trusting this channel."" Yet by Sunday evening, he was claiming, falsely, that Breitbart is ""a website that thrives with white nationalist rhetoric.""They simply cannot help themselves. Blinded by hatred, they will lie about anything, and anyone, to reverse Election Day.Hillary Clinton called Trump voters ""the basket of deplorables ... the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it.""

Bannon (or, for those who want to maximize their SEO, Steve Bannon) -- president-elect Donald Trump's pick for White House chief strategist -- expressed his political philosophy long before joining Trump's insurgent populist presidential campaign. Now, Americans can reflect on what issues Bannon may take on within a Trump White House -- and it does not look good for the culture of corruption in Washington, DC.In 2011, Bannon spoke at an event for ""The Liberty Restoration Foundation"" in Orlando, Florida, talking to attendees about his recent film The Undefeated and the Tea Party movement.In the roughly twenty-four minute speech, Bannon bucks several conservative orthodoxies of the day. For one, he says that Barack Obama is not the problem; he is a symptom of the problems in America's leadership. Similarly, he warns not to dismiss ""the Occupy Wall Street kids"" but to listen to them -- for, if the conservative grassroots does not take a stand, the twisted view of college-indoctrinated activists becomes the nation's future.Ironically, he predicts that anyone who may actually make the hard decisions to clean up DC's financial and ethical messes will be ""vilified"" and ""called every name in the book."" Immediately after Trump announced Bannon's White House appointment, establishment media falsely labeled him an anti-Semite and white supremacist.The system lacks the political courage to actually take it on [the looming federal debt crisis, included trillions in unfunded liabilities]. The hardest, nastiest days -- if you look at Europe, just look what's happening. Look what happened in the House of Commons yesterday when some conservatives stood up and said, ""We've had it with Europe. We want out. We want out of this whole mess."" And they turned on each other. I said this on Hannity back in February 2010, when he had me -- they had a special for Generation Zero, the first time outside The Passion of the Christ they'd ever taken an hour for one movie.And I said all the easy choices are in back of us. All the easy decisions were years ago. Everything from here on in is gonna be hard and nasty and ugly and you're gonna be called every name in the book. You're gonna be vilified. [emphasis added]A key portion of the speech lays out Bannon's populist indictment of Washington, DC's ""crony capitalism and permanent political class"" and a profile of the ""anger"" that drives the Tea Party movement:These are the people that are, as Rick Santelli so brilliantly observed: They're those who carry the water, not those who drink the water. They're the ones that hold our social organizations together, build our cities, run our little leagues, fight our wars, right? It's the backbone of this country. And they're enraged, and here's why they're enraged. They understand we have a system now that has socialism -- as you pointed out so eloquently -- we have socialism for the very poor, right -- a system that, a trillion dollars a year in welfare state benefits with no taxes, right? And sixty percent of the country getting that. And we have socialism for the very wealthy, right?The anger of the Tea Party is not racism, they're not homophobes, they're not nativist; what they are is common-sense, practical middle-class people that understand that they're paying for their own and their children's destruction. Right? And that's the rage.You know, the bonus pool this year, the bonus pool on Wall Street -- of all the financial firms, in 2007, the year before -- in 2006 and 2007, the two years where all the transactions that imploded in 2008, the bonus pool is gonna be about the same this year. Right? You know, TARP -- if our business, if your business or your business had gotten in trouble and Goldman Sachs, where I was trained, had come in and given you a financing? Trust me, you would have been wiped out and you would have been fired. Right? They weren't. All their stock is still worth a ton of money because they weren't. We basically gave them free money and bailed them out.There's no recession in the Hamptons. There's no recession in Georgetown. The other day, the Washington Post reports, five of the seven wealthiest counties in the country are the suburbs of Washington, DC. The per capita income in Washington, DC, for the first time in history, is greater than Silicon Valley. That is not a random event.What Sarah Palin -- the reason I wanted to make the movie -- Sarah Palin went up against the political class in Alaska and Big Oil. Because it wasn't that it was corrupt -- there's always gonna be corruption, there's always gonna be bad guys taking  money. That's human nature. Read Plutarch; that happened back in Greece and Rome. We have something much worse: a compromised political class. Crony capitalism and a permanent political class, right?It's quite simple: how does a guy go to Washington, basically making a hundred thousand dollars a year as a lawyer in some locality, and at the end of ten years, on $165,000 and another 15,000 by federal money he can make, having to keep basically, sometimes, two locations -- how is his net worth five million dollars? And in ten years, like Harry Reid, how is Harry Reid's net worth fifteen million dollars? That's not even mathematics, that's just arithmetic. How does that work? That's what the Tea Party, that's what this revolt is about.On Sunday, president-elect Trump announced that Bannon would serve as White House Chief Strategist alongside RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who will become White House Chief of Staff. Since then, establishment media and top Democrats -- including Harry Reid, who Bannon name dropped as a curiously wealthy example of DC corruption -- have slung mud at Bannon, stoking fear of racism.On Thursday, two wildly different voices defied the hysteria from the progressive left and establishment journalists: Israeli ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer and comedian Jon Stewart. Dermer released a statement saying: ""we [in the Israeli government] look forward to working with the Trump administration, with all of the members of the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon, and making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.""Stewart relayed in an interview that he has told his co-workers freaking out about Bannon that they don't ""know our history"" and that America has survived and even lionized liberal presidents such as Lyndon Johnson, who espoused racist sentiments.The system lacks the political courage to actually take it on [the looming federal debt crisis, included trillions in unfunded liabilities].

Bannon to a top White House post.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROne reporter questioned Obama about Bannon's appointment during the president's press conference on Monday in the White House briefing room, before his trip to Greece.The reporter asked:What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments that were expressed by President-elect Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I'm talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the so-called alt-right movement, what many call the white nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under President Trump as his chief strategist and senior advisor. What message does that send to the country, to the world?But Obama refused to engage with the ongoing criticism of Bannon, citing his responsibility to promote a smooth transition of power.""I think it's fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the President-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we're going to try to facilitate a smooth transition,"" Obama replied.In Greece, Obama was asked during a press conference with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, specifically about ""the fact that Stephen Bannon was made as chief strategist"" questioning whether the president-elect could be a reliable partner with Europe as a result.Obama replied he was ""cautiously optimistic"" that Trump could shift from campaign mode to governing mode.""[T]here's something about the solemn responsibilities of that office, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States, not just by its own people but by people around the world, that forces you to focus, that demands seriousness,"" he said.Obama was again offered the chance to criticize Trump's staff picks again during a press conference in Germany.""I'm wondering, as well, if you've advised your successor to be extra mindful of what you see as some very worrisome trends, particularly when it comes to making his own potentially powerful staff picks,"" one reporter asked Obama during his press conference on Thursday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Obama replied that Trump ran an ""extraordinarily unconventional campaign,"" that resulted in ""the biggest political upset in perhaps modern political history."" He admitted that Trump needed to unify the country with his decisions as president, but did not refer specifically to his staff choices.Obama is unique among Democrats in not outrightly condemning Bannon's appointment, falsely accusing Trump of putting a white supremacist and a white nationalist into the White House.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid both blasted Bannon, demanding that Trump rescind his decision for Bannon to serve as his adviser.""If Trump is serious about seeking unity, the first thing he should do is rescind his appointment of Steve Bannon,"" Reid said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""Rescind it. Don't do it. Think about this. Don't do it.""Pelosi denounced the decision in a statement to reporters on Monday.""Bringing Steve Bannon into the White House is an alarming signal that President-elect Trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign,"" she said.Pelosi also asked Vice president-elect Mike Pence for Donald Trump to reconsider his decision to appoint Bannon to his staff, during a private meeting at the Capitol.SIGN UP"
