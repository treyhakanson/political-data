Another statement said five villages were taken north of Mosul, where Peshmerga fighters are also being deployed.Islamic State militants has been fighting off the two-week offensive with suicide car bombs, snipers and mortar fire.They have also set oil wells on fire to cover their movements and displaced thousands of civilians from villages toward Mosul, using them as human shields, U.N. officials and villagers who spoke to Reuters have said.Worst-case United Nations forecasts see up to 1 million people being uprooted by the fighting, which U.N. aid agencies said had so far forced about 17,500 people to flee -- a figure that excludes those taken into Mosul by the retreating militants.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

But since Russia began to intervene in the Syrian civil war last year in an attempt to protect the regime of President Bashar Assad, things have changed.One particular worry, the report said, was the impending arrival of the Admiral Kuznetsov (pictured), Russia's flagship aircraft carrier, which is on its way from the North Sea to the Middle East, and is expected to anchor off the Mediterranean coast of Syria in the coming weeks.The Kuznetsov force is made up of some 1,900 sailors, more than 50 advanced fighter jets, the latest aeronautical defense systems, radars and among the world's best electronic warfare capabilities. The force has anti-submarine capabilities and boats with a wide range of missiles for aerial photography and intelligence-gathering.Read more here.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

But if he had intercourse with a minor, ""he could be looking at 5 to 25 years.""Ms. Pelosi knows that a separate, joint FBI-Justice Department probe of the Clinton Foundation is being led by Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Pelosi should also be aware that, as law enforcement sources told CNN, Bharara pushed in September for a subpoena of Weiner's cell phone and other records.SIGN UP"	['Pelosi', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

I got the earliest endorsement ever from the National Rifle Association, the NRA... We are going to save your Second Amendment. We are going to save your Second Amendment, you don't have to worry about it.As the crowd applauded, Trump said he will ""protect the right to keep and bear arms.""Trump's pro-gun message resonates because he has been consistently pro-gun throughout the presidential campaign.On April 11, 2015 -- as all the would-be Republican primary field was taking shape -- Trump told Breitbart News:It is so important that we maintain the Second Amendment and that we maintain it strongly. And one of the main reasons is because the good people, the upstanding people, follow laws and norms but the bad ones don't. So if the Second Amendment weren't there to protect our rights and someone tampered with them, the good people would be affected but the bad people wouldn't care-they couldn't care less.It is absolutely imperative that we maintain the Second Amendment in its strongest form.Moreover, Trump is a lifetime member of the NRA and a concealed carry permit holder who believes concealed carry ""is a right, not a privilege."" In a September 18, 2015, position paper, Trump explained that ""the right of self-defense doesn't stop at the end of your driveway"" and contended that the right to defend one's life is viable wherever a person goes. He said, ""I have a concealed carry permit and...tens of millions of Americans do too. That permit should be valid in all 50 states. A driver's license works in every state, so it's common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state.""He said, ""I have a concealed carry permit and... tens of millions of Americans do too. That permit should be valid in all 50 states. A driver's license works in every state, so it's common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state.""Trump opposes an ""assault weapons"" ban and a ban on ""high-capacity"" magazines. He said:Opponents of gun rights try to come up with scary sounding phrases like ""assault weapons,"" ""military-style weapons"" and ""high capacity magazines"" to confuse people. What they're really talking about are popular semi-automatic rifles and standard magazines that are owned by tens of millions of Americans. Law-abiding people should be allowed to own the firearm of their choice.On October 9, 2016, Breitbart News reported that Trump countered the push to ban ""assault weapons"" by simply stating that Americans should be able to own the ""the firearm of their choice.""In addition to being consistently pro-gun, Trump has also stayed the course in warning Americans that Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment.On May 10, 2016, Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin responded to Trump, saying, ""Of course Hillary Clinton does not want to repeal the Second Amendment."" But after saying this, Schwerin hedged his bets by reminding everyone that Clinton does disagree with the District of Columbia v Heller (2008) ruling; that ruling reaffirmed the individual right to keep and bear arms. Huffington Post quoted Schwerin as he stressed that Clinton ""believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.""This proves Trump's point, which is not that Clinton wants to repeal the Second Amendment but that she wants to gut it.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

Harry Reid said in a public letter to the FBI director, released Sunday, Oct. 30.""I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law,"" Reid claimed.Comey is unfairly aiding the GOP candidate, Reid claimed, by hiding critical information about Russian support for Donald Trump even as he also raises suspicions about Hillary Clinton:The double standard established by your actions is clear.In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government - a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity.

In 2012, Reid falsely claimed that GOP presidential candidate Gov. Mitt Romney had not paid his federal taxes for a decade. The statement was untrue, but Reid remains unapologetic for participating in the Democratic effort to smear Romney. In September 2016, Reid was asked about his statement by the Washington Post, and he replied:People bring that up, it's one of the best things I've ever done. Why? Because I knew what he had done was not be transparent and forthright about his taxes and to this day he hasn't released his tax returns. ... Did I want to do that? No. I had the information, I tried to get somebody else to do it. I tried to get somebody in the Obama 'reelect,' I tried to get one of the senators, I tried to get one of the outside groups, but nobody would do it. So I did it. And with that, like everything, I think in life, here's something I learned from my father, if you're going to do something, don't do it half-assed, don't play around. With the Mitt Romney stuff, I didn't play around.Read the Senator's letter here. The double standard established by your actions is clear.

Given other considerations, 63 percent say it makes no difference.Those who say the issue makes them less apt to back Clinton overwhelmingly back Trump in the first place. But what's key in a close contest is whether the disclosure give Trump supporters further motivation to turn out for him - and whether it demotivates reluctant Clinton backers...In earlier ABC News tracking poll results, a broad 60 percent of likely voters disapproved of how Clinton has handled the email issue, including three in 10 of her own supporters - and 93 percent of Trump's. Nearly all of them disapproved strongly, and that was before Comey revived the issue Friday.Today, a small number of Clinton's supporters, 7 percent, say the matter makes them less likely to support her. About one in seven in some of her key support groups, such as Democrats (13 percent) and liberals (15 percent), say so, rising much higher among groups already predisposed not to vote for her, including 47 percent among conservatives and 52 percent among Republicans and evangelical white Protestants alike.See full results here.

8	8	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/30/michael-novak-catholics-hillary-unvotable/	Theologian Michael Novak: For Catholics, Hillary Is Simply ‘Unvotable’	"Leading conservative intellectual Michael Novak has defined Hillary Clinton as ""unvotable"" for Catholics in the upcoming presidential elections because she and her party oppose everything that Catholics hold most dear.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn an interview with the Italian online journal Tempi on the so-called ""Catholic vote"" in the 2016 elections, Novak admits that Trump is not the candidate of his dreams, but given the options, he stands head and shoulders above his opponent.""It is clear that Trump is not exactly the candidate by whom a Catholic would want to be represented. But in politics you elect a president, not a saint, or a bishop or the Pope,"" said Novak, the author of the international bestseller The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism and a point of reference for many Catholic thinkers.Along with other Catholic intellectuals, Novak considers Hillary to be simply unvotable. ""She's a woman who has lied, violated national laws and anyone else would end up in prison for these things,"" he said. ""As for me, I cannot vote for a candidate so favorable to abortion, to the secularist agenda in the moral sphere and such a ferocious adversary of religious freedom.""Asked about Trump's spat with the Pope over building a border wall with Mexico, Novak said it is a problem that affects Italians but not one that has resonated particularly with American Catholics.""Here, no one pays the slightest attention,"" he said, ""while illegal immigration is a real problem, strongly felt by the Americans who want to uphold the law.""Novak acknowledged that it isn't easy for Europeans to see the elections the way Americans do. ""The truth is that if Clinton wins we risk losing our freedom, because Democrats are increasingly illiberal with those who don't think the way they do,"" he said.Regarding the popularity of the Republican candidate with middle America, Novak said that Trump is ""very good at talking to the gut feelings of the country"" and always repeats the same message to Americans: ""they have betrayed you, it is time to change.""""If he is successful it is because he simply speaks a great truth. All Americans know very well that they have been betrayed. But this betrayal did not happen in a day, it started 60 years ago,"" he said.Gradually, ""we started to divide values from life, values from law, through many small compromises. And Catholics have a great responsibility in this. Education has failed, because the universities have all fallen into the hands of the left and we have pulled down a whole generation, the so-called millennials, into a vacuum of values and meaning,"" he said.""When I think that this should be the main theme in this election and that no one talks about it, it makes me shudder,"" he said.Novak is noteworthy for having refused to sign a letter released by Catholic intellectuals and pundits during the Republican primaries last March, in which they called Trump ""manifestly unfit to be president of the United States"" and urged their fellow Catholics and fellow citizens ""to reject his candidacy.""Although the letter was intended to sway the primaries away from Trump, once he won the nomination, it left the letter's signers in the problematic position of having already come down firmly against the Republican candidate, thereby hobbling their opposition to the Clinton campaign.This, in turn, left Novak as a sort of standard-bearer for Catholic intellectuals firmly opposed to a Hillary Clinton presidency, especially since, as a political realist, he understands -- as some of his colleagues seem not to -- that there are only two serious candidates in the election. For all its poetic grandeur, voting a ""third party"" candidate equates to abstention from the democratic process.In other words, the essay portion of the exam is over. Now it's multiple choice.Novak said that he believes that one of the essential dividing lines between the two parties today revolves around the liberal indoctrination received in American higher education and the subsequent control over U.S. culture.""The main issue in this election is the divide between those who are college educated and those who have not attended,"" says Novak. ""The former have a firm grip on the country. They control the TV stations, newspapers, radio, universities, all the great vehicles of culture.""""Some argue that they have formed a new social class, under the hegemony and control of the Democratic Party. They have drunk from a secular teaching that draws its content from New York Times editorials,"" he said.Catholics ""are regarded with suspicion"" by the academic elites, Novak said, ""because the new politically correct class looks down on all those who do not think as they do, accusing them of sexism and racism.""""If ordinary people are still realistic and live with their feet on the ground, the elites--well represented by the Democrats--are outside the world,"" he said.""In short, they have control of culture, but not of the neighborhoods, not of the streets,"" he said.Follow Thomas D.

Whereas unlawful aliens traditionally sought to evade border agents in hopes of reaching U.S. cities where they could illegally fill American jobs, reports document how many of these new migrants are now turning themselves in to border patrol agents believing they'll be allowed to stay permanently. This 2016 influx of migrants from Central America had exceeded 117,000 by Oct. 1, marking a new record, Breitbart News reported.Many additional thousands of illegal aliens continue to pour across the border via smuggling routes that try to bypass the border patrol. In the 12 months up to October 2016, 271,000 illegal immigrants were caught trying to sneak across the border--but many others escaped arrest and made their way to U.S. workplaces and cities.ICE is the agency responsible for enforcing federal immigration law by identifying and removing illegal aliens within the interior of the nation, as well as removing aliens apprehended at the border by border patrol. After an alien is apprehended by border patrol, the alien is then turned over to ICE, which processes and detains the alien.Although the surge has been largely ignored by corporate media and unacknowledged by the administration, ""the public's safe is in jeopardy,"" the agent warned. Migrants with histories of prior criminal offenses, plus ""would-be perpetrators or terrorists whose intent is to harm Americans or our country as a whole"" could be among those being released from ICE's custody, the agent said.The officer said he believes the reason corporate media refuse to cover the crisis is because ""it's an election year and [the media] have a politically-driven agenda. I don't know why else it wouldn't be covered--this is the worst we've ever seen it,"" the agent said:This is a crisis situation that is not being acknowledged by the administration or the media. I know we had a crisis situation in 2014, but this has this by far surpassed that. Our officers are overworked and overrun. We have had to move several officers from our interior enforcement programs in order to address and assist the officers who have to process all of the illegal border crossers and who are getting hammered by the crisis we're facing down here.""The safety of the American public is at risk,"" the officer warned.Would-be perpetrators have much more of a chance to make it through the system and into our communities. That's a huge concern for us. I don't understand why the administration and the media are not recognizing this as a crisis because that's what it is. By removing officers from enforcement programs, the threat to the American public has increased exponentially... However many officers we move from enforcement programs to help address this crisis means that there are that many fewer people trying to find criminal aliens, and that poses a threat to public safety. It's infringing upon our efforts to keep the American public safe.""In my book, if we miss one criminal alien who goes not to victimize one American citizen, that's one too many,"" the agent said. ""But with the scale we're talking about here, it's likely lots of criminal aliens will to be able to slip through the system. So many Americans could potentially be affected by this.""However, the agent's view does not seem to be shared by many lawmakers. For instance, both Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton have shunned the American victims of illegal alien crime. Similarly, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who last year voted to grant federal funding to Sanctuary Cities, literally fled from grieving mothers, who were forced to bury their children as a result of open borders, as they sought to give him a letter begging him to enforce the nation's immigration laws.""There are lots of aliens we should be removing, but we can't do it because we're handcuffed by policies,"" the agent explained. ""The surge is worse than it was in 2014. Our southern border is not secure. It's so porous. We have people working seven days a week just meet the demand and workload that's being created by this administration's policies.""""The administration's policies have created the influx and the crisis situation because people overrun our border knowing they have a chance to stay,"" the officer said. ""The workload, the number of people, we've had to deal with has by far surpassed any amount we've ever had to handle before.""The Office of Refugee Resettlement is at capacity. The continued influx is going to put us way over capacity,"" the officer explained. ""Once they're processed, we have to either find placement for them or release them, and right now we don't have any place to put them... If we have nowhere to house them, they're going to be released into the public--hundreds of bodies will be released.""The officer continued:In just the past two days alone we're talking in the neighborhood of 200 bodies or more that we need to either find placement for or that will be released from our custody. This figure doesn't include all of the other people that we have yet to process--at ports of entry they have close to 500 aliens to process who have yet to come into our custody. I'm hearing that they're even pulling border patrol agents to assist them because they don't have enough to keep up with processing all of the aliens.""And mind you,"" the officer added, ""that figure is just the number of people that come over as a family unit--this doesn't include the unaccompanied children or illegal adults who cross the border.""This is significant because Hillary Clinton has pledged to ""end family detention and close private immigrant detention centers.""""Hillary believes we should end family detention for parents and children who arrive at our border in desperate situations. We have alternatives to detention for those who pose no flight or public safety risk, such as supervised release,"" reads Clinton's campaign website.The agent described such a proposal as ""ridiculous"" and dangerous--as her plan could enable criminal aliens to enter the country and victimize innocent Americans. ""If we think we have a mass migration problem now, and she's trying to propose something like that, it's only going to further overrun our borders and our officers,"" the agent said.""Does she propose we just release them?"" the agent asked. ""It sounds like she wants to create just another avenue for criminal aliens to re-enter the country and commit more crimes, and victimize more people while they're here... Her proposal seems pretty far-fetched and seems to lack any knowledge of what the real issues are... There have been many instances where the men that we're processing, who arrive with their family unit, have some criminal offenses in their history--is she proposing that we not investigate that?""In September, the National ICE Council, which represents the nation's roughly 5,000 frontline ICE officers, agents, and personnel endorsed Donald Trump over Clinton and ""urged all Americans, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support Donald J. Trump, and to protect American jobs, wages and lives."" The endorsement marked the ICE Council's first-ever endorsement of any candidate for any elected office.In a statement announcing the endorsement, the council's president warned against Clinton's ""radical plan"" of ""total amnesty plus open borders"" that ""would result in the loss of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S. borders."" The ICE Council president warned that the agenda of non-enforcement, favored by Clinton, ""results in the daily loss of life.""This is a crisis situation that is not being acknowledged by the administration or the media. I know we had a crisis situation in 2014, but this has this by far surpassed that. Our officers are overworked and overrun. We have had to move several officers from our interior enforcement programs in order to address and assist the officers who have to process all of the illegal border crossers and who are getting hammered by the crisis we're facing down here.Would-be perpetrators have much more of a chance to make it through the system and into our communities.

He was met with a resounding ""No!""He then speculated that one of the two main reasons for declining NFL ratings this seasons was interest in politics.The other reason, he said, was Colin Kaepernick, the second-string quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers who has protested the Star-Spangled Banner in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.At the mention of Kaepernick's name, the crowd booed loudly.Trump had emerged onstage holding a rainbow flag, on which the words ""LGBTs for Trump"" had been written.Earlier in the day, at a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, he had held up a homemade sign reading: ""Latinas for Trump.""Trump spent several minutes quoting negative things said about Hillary Clinton by her associates and allies.He quoted Clinton campaign manager John Podesta: ""He speaks so badly about her -- she -- ugh, I won't even say it. He says things about her that I wouldn't say about her. I would fire the guy so fast.""He also quoted Barack Obama -- ""Hillary will say anything, and change nothing"" -- and referenced Michelle Obama's comment about Hillary Clinton being unable to manage the White House, since she could not manage her own house.Trump also promised to bring back mining jobs to Colorado and neighboring Wyoming, and warned that a Clinton administration would ban fracking. He said that mining and oil development could be balanced with environmental quality: ""We want work, we want air, and we want safety.""As he has done in other states, Trump described a local case in which an illegal alien had committed murder, promising to deport all criminal illegal aliens and to build a wall along the border.He said that he would support legal immigration.

Multiple field offices have been involved in the investigation.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA report in Sunday's Wall Street Journal (WSJ) by Devlin Barrett revealed that agents assigned to the New York field office have been carrying the bulk of the work in investigating the Clinton Foundation. They have received assistance from the FBI field office in Little Rock according to ""people familiar with the matter, the WSJ reported. Other offices, including Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., have been collecting evidence regarding ""financial crimes or influence-peddling.""As far back as February 2016, FBI agents made the presentation to the Department of Justice (DOJ), the WSJ's sources stated. ""The meeting didn't go well,"" they wrote. While some sources said the FBI's evidence was not strong enough, others believed the DOJ had no intention of going any further from the start. Barrett wrote that the DOJ officials were ""stern, icy and dismissive of the case.""Barrett wrote, ""'That was one of the weirdest meetings I've ever been to,' one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter.""It appears there was a rift between the FBI and the DOJ about how to move forward with the investigation. Agents in the Washington office were directed to focus on a separate issue related to the actions of former Virginia Governor and Clinton Foundation Board member Terry McAuliffe. Agents inside the FBI believed they could build a stronger case if the investigation of McAuliffe and the foundation were combined.FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe seemed to be caught in the middle of the fight between DOJ officials who appeared to want to slow down or shut down the investigation, and FBI agents who were eager to pour more resources into the investigation.Barrett wrote, ""'Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?' Mr. McCabe asked, according to people familiar with the conversation. After a pause, the official replied, 'Of course not,' these people said.""Some of the WSJ sources told Barrett that a ""stand down"" order had been given to the FBI agents by McCabe. Others denied that such an order was given.Preet Bharara, an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, appears to have taken an interest in moving forward from the DOJ side, the Daily Caller's Richard Pollock reported in August.Pollock wrote:The New York-based probe is being led by Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Bharara's prosecutorial aggressiveness has resulted in a large number of convictions of banks, hedge funds and Wall Street insiders.He said prosecutorial support could come from multiple U.S. Attorneys Offices and stated this was a major departure from other ""centralized FBI investigations.""The story gets more complicated when you factor in that McCabe's wife, Dr. Jill McCabe had received a $467,500 campaign contribution in 2015 for a state senate race from McAuliffe.CNN also reported that multiple field offices were ""in agreement a public corruption investigation should be launched"" with Clinton Foundation officials as a target.

'revolt' and made a sexually suggestive joke about Mr. Weiner,"" the Times reported.(The Times described the joke as follows: ""'As Podesta said, she's got bad instincts,' Mr. Trump said, distorting a comment in one of the thousands of Mr. Podesta's hacked emails recently released by WikiLeaks. 'Well, she's got bad instincts when her emails are on Anthony Weiner's wherever.'"")Now, however, evidence appears to be emerging to support Trump's claim.According to the Journal report, the number of emails the FBI wants to search on Anthony Weiner's laptop computer is 650,000. It is not clear how many of the 650,000 emails involve Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton; how many of those e-mails are work-related; or how many of them may have contained classified information.The FBI is apparently awaiting for a warrant to search the computer for emails relating to the Clinton investigation. Currently it only has a warrant to search for child pornography, the Journal reports.The report also confirms that the FBI has been investigating the Clinton foundation -- and internal disagreements about how to proceed.Some of those disagreements, according to sources cited by the Journal, revolve around FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, received nearly $500,000 in campaign funds from Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton ally.Joel B.

""While Tinder strongly supports such testing, the billboard's statements are not founded upon any scientific evidence and are incapable of withstanding critical analysis.""Earlier this year, Tinder added an STD testing locator to its app.Josh Bloom of the American Council on Science and Health said that the rise in syphilis among gay men is due to the fact that there are drugs that allow HIV-positive people to have unprotected sex without passing it on to uninfected partners.In women, the rise in syphilis is due to the fact that women are using forms of protection during sex other than condoms.""Kids are a lot more afraid of getting pregnant than getting a disease that only needs a little cipro,"" Kay Hymowitz of the Manhattan Institute said.Syphilis is hard to detect because its symptoms can mimic other diseases.

He says the evidence included 60,000-plus pages of written documents, video and ""hours and hours"" of tape recordings, all of which are still under lock and key.During the interview, which aired on this reporter's talk radio program, ""Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,"" Schippers, unprompted, raised questions about the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. He further claimed, ""We know that there were people who disappeared.""Regarding his stated fear of Hillary, Schippers said:""Today, I am still terrified of Hillary. Absolutely I am terrified. Because if she gets into office. In fact, I've told my wife, I said, 'If Hillary gets elected, look for the FBI or somebody to come and pick me up the next day.'""And I think I'm the only one left. [Former Congressman] Henry Hyde is dead. [Independent Counsel Kenneth] Star didn't really hurt her. Yeah. I was scared when I was out there... I've been terrified ever since. Because things happen. Things happen.""Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, had asked Schippers, a Democrat, to lead the House impeachment probe.During the interview, Schippers raised questions about the death of Foster, whose body was discovered on July 20, 1993 in Virginia's Fort Marcy Park. An autopsy concluded the cause of death was a ""perforating gunshot wound mouth-head.""Without offering proof, Schippers said he believed that Foster was a ""weak link in the chain of evidence,"" and that his investigative committee was barred from probing the lawyer's death.He stated:""Vince Foster was probably as close to Hillary as anybody on the face of the Earth. He knew all about the (Rose) law firm. He knew all about Whitewater. He knew all about the money she made, the $100,000 she made overnight in the commodities market. He knew everything.""And I think he was a weak link. In my opinion, he was a weak link in the chain of evidence. And obviously, we could never have called him as a witness. But I was going into that investigation. I was going to call FBI agents. I was going to call the Park Service. I was going to call the coroner and everybody else. We weren't allowed to do it. We were stymied. Just stopped dead in our tracks. And I don't know why.""Five official or governmental investigations concluded that Foster committed suicide. The nature of Foster's work, as well as the six days it took before Foster's suicide note was found, led to speculation and conspiracies about his death.I asked Schippers, ""Are you saying, if I am hearing you correctly, that there are legitimate questions that you believe should be asked about the deaths surrounding the Clintons, like Vince Foster and others?""""Absolutely. Absolutely,"" he replied.Schippers further claimed that ""We know that there were people who disappeared.""He continued:""When we started our investigation, Henry Hyde said, 'How wide do you want to go?' And I said, 'Get us an open investigation. We have so many things that we want to investigate.' And we got an open investigation where we were permitted to investigate as far as whatever came up in the impeachment inquiry.""Immediately after the 1998 election, the leadership in the House put the brakes on. We had a meeting and Henry Hyde said the House has told us that we've got Monica Lewinsky and we can go no further. We are not permitted to do any additional investigation. And I said, 'My God, we've got at least three murders and other things that we are going into.' And he says, 'I'm sorry we can't do it.'""Schippers described the room at the Ford House Office Building where the evidence was housed during the impeachment probe as having armed guards outside. He said those who were permitted to enter were not allowed to bring anything in or out.He said he was one of the few people who actually reviewed all of the evidence in the impeachment case. He said that only 65 House members accepted an invitation to review the evidence in the room and that all senators declined before they voted against impeaching Clinton.Asked about the specifics of the evidence, Schippers said he is barred from answering the question.

This does not account for the damage caused by those who hurt or kill under the influence of drugs, the blood-borne diseases spread by sharing dirty needles, and the inherent violence involved in building a drug-trafficking enterprise.Drug abuse and addiction problems are damaging many communities across the country, said Trump's release, published Friday. ""People managing debilitating chronic pain get hooked on powerful prescription drugs and even turn to heroin on the street when it becomes too difficult to obtain new prescriptions. It afflicts urban and rural, young and old.""In campaign speeches around the country, Trump frequently talks of the devastation that the raging heroin epidemic wreaks on families and young Americans in particular.Nearly all of the heroin used in the U.S. is brought across the border by Mexican traffickers, who are almost always illegal aliens. ""The open border policies of Hillary Clinton, including catch and release, another terrible practice, have allowed a massive influx of drugs into New Hampshire, and frankly, to states all over our country. Almost every state. And it's really fueled the tremendous drug and heroin crisis that we have,"" Trump said in a New Hampshire speech earlier in October.Trump also slammed Obama and Clinton for their lenient crime positions which he says perpetuates the drug epidemic. ""President Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories. Hillary Clinton promises to continue this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals,"" Trump said.The Obama administration already released 30,000 convicts in federal prison while following revisions in sentencing guidelines, and the administration may release another 40,000, according to Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton.The first step Trump outlined in his plan: Controlling immigration. A Trump administration would work to strip federal funds from cities which provide legal sanctuary to illegals, it would ""aggressively prosecute"" drug traffickers, deport illegal alien cartel members and drug traffickers, and build a southern border wall.Trump also promised to close ""shipping loopholes"" that allow China to ship fentanyl, a lethal opioid 50 times stronger than heroin that's much cheaper to produce, or its components into U.S. communities.An internal Drug Enforcement Administration briefing analyzed by the Wall Street Journal in June stated that China was the ""primary source"" of of fentanyl and its building blocks:China's sprawling chemicals industry has helped foster this booming trade. So has spotty regulation in China and beyond. While U.S. law limits and monitors trade in key ingredients used to make fentanyl, the chemicals are unregulated in China or by United Nations conventions that police the global drug trade. U.S. law requires that any import or export of pill presses be for ""legitimate uses"" and reported to the DEA, but China and Canada's federal government don't regulate their trade. These gaps allow some traffickers in the Americas easier access to materials that help them set up their own clandestine labs.Along with cracking down on fentanyl arriving from overseas and Mexico, Trump said he would restrict the number of opioids like fentanyl produced and sold in the U.S.Trump said he supports the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, signed by Obama in July, which proponents call the first piece of federal legislation dealing with drug addiction in decades.He also stated his administration would ""expand incentives to use drug courts and mandated treatment,"" ""expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment,"" and ""distribute widely naloxone/narcan (opioid antidote to treat OD) to first responders and caregivers"" in order to revive drug users dying from an overdose.China's sprawling chemicals industry has helped foster this booming trade.

A Donald Trump likeness stands proudly outside the cell with a ""thumbs up"" sign of approval.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSan Jacinto County Republican Party Chairman Dwayne Wright built the satirical jail, located just a few feet outside the 100' electioneering boundary, on Monday - before the latest revelation of the FBI's re-opening of the Clinton email investigation. Wright led a successful revolution over the past few years to turn the historically blue East Texas county red.""Some of the few remaining Democrats in our county cried foul and called in a Houston television station,"" Wright told Breitbart Texas on Saturday. ""The funny thing is, we have had many other people we know are Democrats come by and laugh and take their photos with the make-believe  jail.""Wright show his own video of the Houston ABC affiliate's news coverage.
""I think they're trying to influence or depress the vote with this,"" San Jacinto County Democrat Michaela Ellis told KTRK's Steve Campion. ""This is extreme.""""Extreme?"" Wright responded. ""I call it political satire. Political satire has been around  for centuries. And besides, as the county's GOP chair, isn't it my job to try and influence voters?""The jail mock-up is directly across the street from the entrance to the election administrator's office where early voting has been underway since Monday. ""We have had record numbers of people showing up to vote. Judging from the number of thumbs up we are seeing from voters and the number of people who go out of their way to come over and talk to us, we are winning in this county again.""Wright live-streamed another video on Periscope showing voters reactions to the jail mockup.Breitbart Texas observed several people coming over to take pictures and comment on the imprisoned Hillary Clinton cutout.One man came over, a local black man who identified himself as a Democrat, and laughed while taking a picture of the jail. ""Y'all can come up with some funny stuff.""Another voter, Julie Perrill, a woman from a part of Cleveland, Texas located in southern San Jacinto County, came over for a photo. As she was leaving she revealed her political position as she exclaimed, ""May the best MAN win!""Photo: Bob Price/Breitbart TexasWright said people have come as far as Flagstaff, Arizona, to stop by and visit the jail. ""The response has been incredible. After the word got out on Twitter and Facebook, we have people driving in to see what we are doing.""""This is really about free speech,"" Wright explained in response to the offended Democrats. ""You aren't exercising your first amendment rights if you only make non-controversial statements.""A local Hispanic couple came by and posed for a photo with Hillary and Trump. ""Lock her up!"" the woman said. She said she has been a Trump supporter for a long time.Wright received a photo of another jail cell that featured Hillary in lockup from a Republican activist in another state. ""There is no copyright on this idea,"" the GOP chairman said. ""I hope people will replicate this idea all across the country. While the image is funny, the reality that people could elect a person who might really be headed to jail is very scary.""Facebook photo via Dwayne WrightSince being elected as chairman of the county's Republican Party in 2014, Wright has established a record of effective leadership. He has led the charge to not only removed Democrats from office via the polls in the historically blue county, but to also hold elected Republicans accountable for following party principles.His team has now set its sights on replacing popular Democrat constable in Precinct 4 Alvin Wyatt with Republican Haney Wilkerson. The race drew the attention of the Republican Party of Texas and Toni Anne Dashiell, the Texas National Committeewoman to the Republican National Committee, visited the county in September to present a $1,500 campaign contribution to Wilkerson from the state party's candidate resource committee.""This race will be tight,"" Wright conceded, ""but if we can win this one, there is not a safe Democrat position left in the county.""Wright said his jail cell, which features a Hillary Clinton cutout complete with an inmate number on her jacket, will remain in place throughout early voting and on Election Day.

""... Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it more expensive -- in fact, much more expensive. My contract with the American voter includes a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.""Trump also slammed the Iran deal, inviting the audience to consider the spectacle of $1.7 billion in cash being offloaded from cargo planes. He promised to lower taxes to expand business and jobs; to suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program; and to build a wall along the border.But his most strident attacks focused on Clinton's email scandal. Trump reserved particular attention for Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whom he speculated had been offered re-appointment in a Hillary Clinton administration, in her infamous secret meeting with Bill Clinton before the FBI's June decision on whether to recommend prosecution.""What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and we are all equal under those laws,"" he said, adding later: ""We have one ultimate check on Hillary's corruption, and that is the power of the vote. The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote,"" he said.Trump also cited James O'Keefe -- ""a very talented young man,"" he said -- and Wikileaks' expose of Democrats' efforts to incite violence at his rallies.From the stage, he also directed staff to assist a woman who had taken ill, and invited her back when she felt better.And he held aloft a supporter's homemade sign that read: ""Latinas for Trump."" Then he invited the sign's owner onstage.The woman, who said she was originally from Mexico, said that she supported Trump because he supports law and order. ""You have to come into this country legally,"" she added, to cheers.One of those supporters, Enrico Jimenez, 26, came dressed in a convict costume, with a Hillary Clinton mask, and posed for pictures with other Trump supporters.""Like most people, it pisses me off that politicians are corrupt and commit felonies and get away with it, as if they are above the law.The FBI re-opening the case gives me a little hope. In the words of Hillary Clinton: 'There should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too big to jail'.""In front of the media pen, several dozen women faced the television cameras holding ""Women for Trump"" signs. Laura, from Las Vegas, said, ""We're facing you because we think you ignore us. No matter how many people."" Another chimed in: ""We're alive and well!""James Barber of Arizona drove up to attend the rally, and said he was confident about Trump's chances. ""I think he will do well, because of the hidden Trump supporters -- what I call the 'hiding' Trump supporters,"" he said.""I'm a Trump supporter but I will not put a bumper sticker on my car because I'm afraid it will be vandalized.""He was wearing a Rush Limbaugh T-shirt -- ""I'm a Hillary deplorable"" -- and holding a homemade sign that read: ""Escapee from the Democrat plantation.""Barber explained: ""I voted for Clinton in 1992. In 1993, he passed a retroactive tax increase that took 75% of my raise that I worked hard to get. I heard Bill Clinton say that he knew better than I did how to spend my money. That's when I became a Republican, and I have been one for the last 23 years.""As for those Republicans who felt that Trump did not represent their party, he said: ""They would rather have a liberal Supreme Court.""Another attendee, Yaakov Kalman of Washington, D.C., was highly visible in a bright orange yarmulke and t-shirt.Asked how he felt about recent charges that Trump -- or his supporters -- were antisemitic, Kalman said: ""The most important issue is support for the security and longevity of Israel. Of the two candidates, he's best for Israel.""I think in his heart he is not antisemitic. However, some of the things he says can be misconstrued and misinterpreted.""Warm-up speaker Wayne Allen Root -- who has appeared for Trump at numerous local rallies -- led cheers of ""Lock her up!"", and touted the news that the FBI would re-open its investigation into Clinton's emails, calling it ""Christmas in October ... Merry Christmas, deplorables!""He joked that Hillary Clinton had been done in by a ""leaking Weiner,"" and accused the pollsters of ""premature prognostication."" The combative Root closed: ""We will never accept defeat ... I will give you my country when you pry it from my cold, dead hands.""Another speaker, Danny Tarkanian -- son of local basketball legend Jerry Tarkanian, and a candidate for Congress in Nevada's 3rd congressional district -- had a different approach. When the crowd started chanting ""Lock her up!"", he responded, to cheers: ""I've got something better ... why don't we just vote her down?""Organizers informed fans throughout the rally that there were buses outside the Venetian to take them to the polls for early voting and bring them back.The Venetian is owned by Sheldon Adelson, a ""megadonor"" to Republican and pro-Israel causes, as well as a philanthropist who has established a network of addiction clinics with his wife, Miriam.Trump thanked both of the Adelsons at the start of his speech, to cheers from the audience.Joel B.

Mr. DiGenova eviscerated the way Comey conducted his investigation and explained that he believes it has tarnished the FBI director's reputation permanently, telling Breitbart News:The original so-called 'investigation' was not an investigation. It was not thorough. It was not professional. As far as we know there was no grand jury, which an ordinary investigation would have. There were no grand jury subpoenas, there were no search warrants. Immunities were given out like candy. Attorneys were allowed to represent multiple witnesses and defendants which is completely inconsistent with federal policy and ethical standards. The list is endless.The original investigation was not intended to be a real investigation. Comey decided -- for political reasons- that he wanted to exonerate Hillary Clinton and the only answer to why he wanted to do that was because he didn't want to be responsible for recommending the prosecution of the first female nominee of a major political party for President of the United States.They followed none of the protocols that they ordinarily would have attained in such a prosecution. And the proof that that is the case is the letter that he sent to Congress, in which he announced that he was basically reopening the case because they had newly discovered evidence which was evidence on the laptop shared by Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. If the original investigation had been conducted properly they would have known about that laptop, and they would have known about the tens of thousands of emails that related to the earlier investigation.It is inconceivable to me that they did not learn about that other device, given the fact that Huma Abedin was interviewed, she allegedly gave up certain devices -- but apparently not this one.It's no wonder that people who I have spoken to inside the Bureau and outside the Bureau view Comey as a dirty cop because they believe he has brought disrepute on the agency. The letter he sent just shows how bad the first investigation was.People in the FBI are very disappointed in Comey's leadership. They believe that he is unfit to serve, they believe he has no moral authority to lead the Bureau, they believe that he has created a double standard of justice established by his investigation into Clinton, that he has undermined the rule of law, that he has no credibility, and that he has become an embarrassment to the Bureau.That is generally the thought certainly among former Bureau people, and it is certainly among the field agents and among the people in that building in Washington. There just is no doubt that the manner in which he has conducted himself has really, really sent a shiver through that building. And had it not been for that letter that he sent the other day, that he would be probably be facing a joint-Congressional resolution of no confidence in his leadership of the Bureau.Ask whether the increasingly loud drumbeat of leaks coming from within the FBI were a factor in Comey's decision to send the letter to Congress that started the firestorm of controversy, DiGenova pulls no punches in his assessment.Well, he didn't have any choice. He had to send the letter once he was confronted with the evidence of the New York investigation. If he hadn't sent the letter, there would have been leaks out of New York and he would have been embarrassed. So, he sent the letter because he didn't have any choice and it's as simple as that. I mean, they were gonna leak it, and he knew it.Clinton campaign chair John Podesta told reporters on Saturday that the campaign continues to stand with Huma Abedin but DiGenova believes that the continuing investigation is unlikely to bode well for Abedin.Huma Abedin is facing the possible criminal charges involving the laptop -- what was on it, how it got there, what's the classification. She may have lied to the FBI, denying the existence of such a laptop. So there's all sorts of things; false statements, prosecutions, classified information.Mr. DiGenova believes that had he not succumbed to political pressure, director Comey still could have served the interests of justice without Hillary Clinton's presidential run.Comey missed a golden opportunity in the original investigation. Here's what he should have done, instead of trying to be Sir Lancelot and trying to free Hillary Clinton from this. What he should have done was said ""Here's what we're gonna do, Lorreta Lynch. These people have violated the law, clearly and thoroughly. Let's offer everybody a misdemeanor. They all get to keep their civil rights, she can keep running for President, but we will have accountability.""When you go back and look at it, you have to ask yourself ""does this guy have half a brain?"" He really thought that people were stupid and they weren't gonna understand what he was doing? He found out very quickly inside the Bureau that people were pretty smart and they didn't like what he did.DiGenova made it clear to Breitbart News that he believes that Comey has now painted himself into a corner, primarily by botching the first investigation so thoroughly and now by incurring the wrath of the Clinton campaign, with no clear pre-election exit strategy.He has obviously succumbed to pressure, he folded like a cheap suit by sending a letter because of the manifestly improper decision that he made originally to not prosecute. He shouldn't say anything further, in light of his statement. If they conclude the investigation in the next few days and he comes out publicly and says there's nothing there, I don't know what will happen inside the Bureau. The place is seething right now. Some of the more senior former FBI officials are absolutely livid.You may have seen former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom's comments, in which he was just extremely critical of Director Comey. I would hope that we don't hear anymore from Comey, but at this point he appears to be under some mental stress and he may very well top it and say something additional about it, but then that will show the investigation he's now conducting was just not through again. So it's hard to say what he's gonna do, I think the guy's in some sort of downwards spiral.While the Clinton campaign appears to have waged all-out war on Comey and the FBI in the wake of Friday's bombshell, DiGenova told Breitbart News that he believes the strategy will backfire because of resistance from within the FBI.I think there's going to be leaks. If this is gonna be the Democrat's strategy to save Hillary Clinton, there will be further leaks. There will be leaks of substance, there will be leaks about emails. Comey cannot control the investigation in New York. The reason the first investigation was a flop was that, it wasn't a real investigation, he kept it at headquarters, he kept it at his office, so there were no field agents involved even though there were a lot of people assigned to it they were given very limited rolls. You look at the 302s, which are questions from the FBI, these are interview notes, the questions are sophomoric, there's no follow up.Hillary Clinton says she can't remember 39 times in her interviews. They went to Comey and said she can't remember because she had a head injury -- alright, let's get her medical records. Comey said absolutely not, we are not subpoenaing her medical records. So it's fairly obvious that he cut them off at the pass, he didn't allow them to do their job and they all knew that.Since Comey has no real allies at the moment facing Republicans who are still upset about the first investigation, the Clinton campaign and Democrats digging in for battle, and anger still boiling in the ranks of the FBI, DiGenova says he thinks tougher times are likely ahead for the FBI director.It's not at all surprising that the institution which is known for it's integrity, known for it's professionalism, it's thoroughness, reacted violently to his incompetent inscription of their investigation. Comey has a mutiny on his hands. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna get really roughed up.The original so-called 'investigation' was not an investigation. It was not thorough. It was not professional. As far as we know there was no grand jury, which an ordinary investigation would have. There were no grand jury subpoenas, there were no search warrants. Immunities were given out like candy. Attorneys were allowed to represent multiple witnesses and defendants which is completely inconsistent with federal policy and ethical standards. The list is endless.
The original investigation was not intended to be a real investigation. Comey decided -- for political reasons- that he wanted to exonerate Hillary Clinton and the only answer to why he wanted to do that was because he didn't want to be responsible for recommending the prosecution of the first female nominee of a major political party for President of the United States.
They followed none of the protocols that they ordinarily would have attained in such a prosecution. And the proof that that is the case is the letter that he sent to Congress, in which he announced that he was basically reopening the case because they had newly discovered evidence which was evidence on the laptop shared by Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. If the original investigation had been conducted properly they would have known about that laptop, and they would have known about the tens of thousands of emails that related to the earlier investigation.
It is inconceivable to me that they did not learn about that other device, given the fact that Huma Abedin was interviewed, she allegedly gave up certain devices -- but apparently not this one.
It's no wonder that people who I have spoken to inside the Bureau and outside the Bureau view Comey as a dirty cop because they believe he has brought disrepute on the agency. The letter he sent just shows how bad the first investigation was.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);People in the FBI are very disappointed in Comey's leadership. They believe that he is unfit to serve, they believe he has no moral authority to lead the Bureau, they believe that he has created a double standard of justice established by his investigation into Clinton, that he has undermined the rule of law, that he has no credibility, and that he has become an embarrassment to the Bureau.
That is generally the thought certainly among former Bureau people, and it is certainly among the field agents and among the people in that building in Washington. There just is no doubt that the manner in which he has conducted himself has really, really sent a shiver through that building. And had it not been for that letter that he sent the other day, that he would be probably be facing a joint-Congressional resolution of no confidence in his leadership of the Bureau.Well, he didn't have any choice. He had to send the letter once he was confronted with the evidence of the New York investigation. If he hadn't sent the letter, there would have been leaks out of New York and he would have been embarrassed. So, he sent the letter because he didn't have any choice and it's as simple as that. I mean, they were gonna leak it, and he knew it.Huma Abedin is facing the possible criminal charges involving the laptop -- what was on it, how it got there, what's the classification. She may have lied to the FBI, denying the existence of such a laptop. So there's all sorts of things; false statements, prosecutions, classified information.Comey missed a golden opportunity in the original investigation. Here's what he should have done, instead of trying to be Sir Lancelot and trying to free Hillary Clinton from this. What he should have done was said ""Here's what we're gonna do, Lorreta Lynch. These people have violated the law, clearly and thoroughly. Let's offer everybody a misdemeanor. They all get to keep their civil rights, she can keep running for President, but we will have accountability.""
When you go back and look at it, you have to ask yourself ""does this guy have half a brain?"" He really thought that people were stupid and they weren't gonna understand what he was doing? He found out very quickly inside the Bureau that people were pretty smart and they didn't like what he did.He has obviously succumbed to pressure, he folded like a cheap suit by sending a letter because of the manifestly improper decision that he made originally to not prosecute. He shouldn't say anything further, in light of his statement. If they conclude the investigation in the next few days and he comes out publicly and says there's nothing there, I don't know what will happen inside the Bureau. The place is seething right now. Some of the more senior former FBI officials are absolutely livid.
You may have seen former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom's comments, in which he was just extremely critical of Director Comey. I would hope that we don't hear anymore from Comey, but at this point he appears to be under some mental stress and he may very well top it and say something additional about it, but then that will show the investigation he's now conducting was just not through again. So it's hard to say what he's gonna do, I think the guy's in some sort of downwards spiral.I think there's going to be leaks. If this is gonna be the Democrat's strategy to save Hillary Clinton, there will be further leaks. There will be leaks of substance, there will be leaks about emails. Comey cannot control the investigation in New York. The reason the first investigation was a flop was that, it wasn't a real investigation, he kept it at headquarters, he kept it at his office, so there were no field agents involved even though there were a lot of people assigned to it they were given very limited rolls. You look at the 302s, which are questions from the FBI, these are interview notes, the questions are sophomoric, there's no follow up.
