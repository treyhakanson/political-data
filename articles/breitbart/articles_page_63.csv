Also on the line is the Obama administration's theory that the extremists can be defeated in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere without American ground troops doing the fighting.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFor more than two years, the administration has stuck to its argument that the only path to a sustained victory over the Islamic State group is for locals, not Americans or other outsiders, to bear the main responsibility for the fighting and for governing after the extremists are removed.President Barack Obama has taken a lot of political heat for that approach, which critics say has allowed IS to expand its international reach and influence.The viability of Obama's strategy has been widely doubted. In May 2015, after months of US bombings in Iraq and while in the midst of Americans training and advising Iraqi ground troops, the Iraqis lost the city of Ramadi. Defense Secretary Ash Carter publicly said he doubted the Iraqis' will to fight. Since then, the US support role has grown and the Iraqi security forces have managed to retake key parts of western and northern Iraq, including Ramadi.Mosul is different, not least because it is the place where Islamic State leaders in 2014 announced their intent to create an Islamic-run state after taking a large swath of Iraq and Syria in a lightning surge.White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Monday called Mosul a new measure of Obama's strategy.""And I think the president would be the first to acknowledge that this is a significant test,"" he said, given the size of the city and its importance to IS. ""Dislodging them from the city would be a significant strategic gain,"" Earnest said.US airpower played a key role in the run-up to the fight for Mosul by taking out Islamic State defenses, cash resources, supply routes and some of the group's leaders. The US is now providing air cover as Iraqi security forces and members of the Kurdish militia begin their attempt to retake the city over the next several weeks. American advisers are working with Iraqi troops, but the outcome will be determined largely by the Iraqis.Mosul may answer the question: If IS loses a crown jewel of its so-called caliphate, will that be a decisive and sustainable victory for Iraq? Or will Baghdad once again falter, allowing sectarian and political divisions to destabilize the country and permit a return of extremists?That likely won't be known before Obama's successor takes office. The next president also will inherit the broader problem of Syria -- not just the IS presence there, including in its self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa, but also the civil war with its complications involving Russia, Iran and Turkey.Iraq remains deeply divided, and the grievances among the country's Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish populations that allowed IS to rise to power in the first place have not been resolved. Even if the Mosul campaign is successful militarily, there is a risk of violence erupting again in the form of revenge killings or clashes between groups once allied against a common enemy.Seth Jones, a defense and security expert at the RAND Corp., says the combat phase of the battle for Mosul, while difficult, will be ""much easier"" than the aftermath.""I think there's a strong possibility that a lot of the political grievances actually get accentuated,"" he said in an interview Friday.David Petraeus, the former Army general who commanded U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq in 2007-08, calls the Obama approach in Iraq and Syria ""a new way of fighting.""""It's much more sustainable in terms of blood and treasure than obviously having our forces have to do it,"" Petraeus, who also served as Obama's CIA director, said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week.""Obama began sending small numbers of US military advisers to Iraq in the summer of 2014, after the Islamic State had swept into Mosul and also captured much of western Iraq, including cities like Ramadi and Fallujah where American ground troops had spilled much blood before all US troops left Iraq in 2011. The rise of IS in Iraq was a stinging blow to Obama, whom critics accused of giving up hard-fought gains.He initially insisted there would be no US ""boots on the ground,"" but he authorized a gradual expansion of the US training and advising effort to complement a US-led coalition air campaign. He was supported in his cautious, go-slow approach by his top military adviser at the time, Gen. Martin Dempsey, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when IS moved into Iraq and when Obama began returning US advisers to Baghdad.Dempsey counselled patience. Give the Iraqis time to heal their internal divisions and fight their own battles, he argued. Resist the temptation to grab control of the contest against the Islamic State. Dempsey believed an enduring victory would require a unified Iraq supported by neighbors.""If we were to take control of this campaign, I mean literally seize control of the campaign, then there's no doubt in my mind we would probably defeat ISIL on, let's say, a faster timeline,"" but it would not last, he said in June 2015. ""Maybe ISIL goes away, maybe they're defeated militarily, and two years from now another group with another name and another ideology ... will just be back,"" he said.In the Obama view, Iraq is more likely to regain, and retain, control of its territory if it is not relying on US troops to do the fighting. Mosul is the biggest test of that theory.SIGN UP"

According to Harbi, this had a positive impact on Saudi Arabia's image in the world, since ""the unfortunate incidents that preoccupied public opinion and whose shameful echoes reached the global media have almost completely stopped.""The success of these measures, wrote Harbi, should spur the government to make similar reforms to the driving ban.""This important and courageous decision instantly broke through an imaginary barrier that for years had prevented us from becoming a normal modern society like all the other societies in the world today,"" he writes.Reversing the ban would also allow people to stop thinking that ""Islam is opposed to development, planning, and the protection of human rights,"" he advises.In 2014, proposals to lift the prohibition were put forward by King Abdullah's advisory board. They include allowing women over the age of 30 to drive during daytime hours, but so far nothing has been implemented.SIGN UP"

Patrick Kennedy Must Resign After Asking FBI to Help Him Bury Requested Benghazi Docs	"The campaign spokesman for Donald J. Trump released a statement Monday afternoon demanding that Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy resign after a public release of FBI interview summaries, which included a description of a deal with the FBI that Kennedy proposed.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Today's release of the FBI notes on their investigation into Clinton's secret email server is deeply disturbing,"" said Trump senior spokesman Jason Miller.""The news that top Clinton aide Patrick Kennedy tried to engage in a blatant quid pro quo for changing the classification level of several of Clinton's emails shows a cavalier attitude towards protecting our nation's secrets. Kennedy must resign from the State Department immediately and Clinton must state he has no place in her administration if she is elected President,"" he said.
Kennedy's behavior came to light with the FBI's release Monday of more ""302"" summaries from its interviews relating to Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton's private email account and server scheme. The summaries, typed up on FD-302 forms, are the only records of FBI interviews. FBI interviews are not recorded nor videotaped, and the 302's are typed up after the interview.In one interview conducted July 30, 2015, the FBI interviewed [redacted], who worked at the FBI's Records Management Division, Winchester, Virginia.The individual told the FBI that he received a call from the bureau's International Operations Division, who pressured him to change the classification of an email from classified to unclassified, according to the 302 summary. The caller said that Patrick Kennedy had called him to offer an quid pro quo.Kennedy offered the International Operations Division a deal, according to the interview notes. In exchange for declassifying the email, Kennedy would lift restrictions preventing the FBI from sending agents to countries where the State Department forbade the FBI.Soon after the conversation, the man interviewed told the FBI that he was in a meeting presided over by Kennedy with representatives from Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and other agencies. At one point in the meeting, which was called to address the issue of Clinton's handling of sensitive electronic correspondence, someone asked Kennedy if any of the emails Clinton handled on her private email arrangement were classified.Before Kennedy answered, he made eye contact with the interviewee and then said: ""Well, we'll see.""The interviewee told the FBI that he felt Kennedy was making a direct reference to his proposed swap.In another interview conducted Sept. 30,2015, the FBI spoke to [redacted], a retired official at the International Operations Division who told the agents that in May or June of 2015, he found a note that Kennedy was trying to reach him.This retired IOD official said it was surprising because he and his top aides had been trying to reach Kennedy for months.When the retired IOD official reached Kennedy, the undersecretary had a request about classification-this time, he wanted IOD to classify an email dealing with the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on American personnel and facilities at Benghazi, Libya.Kennedy's ask was for IOD to re-class the email at B9, which the agent's note says could make the document exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests.The IOD interviewee told the FBI: ""Kennedy further stated that the B9 classification would allow him to archive the document in the basement of the State Department never to be seen again.""After a conversation with the bureau's Counterterrorism Division, who had originally classified the email, IOD told Kennedy they would not meet his demand.Miller said Kennedy was exposed disrespecting national security.Not only should Kennedy, a career Foreign Service Officer, resign; Trump's Democratic rival must commit that he will not return to government service, if she is elected president, he said.SIGN UP"

In addition, another 46,893 young men, youths and boys -- dubbed ""unaccompanied alien children"" or ""UACs"" -- from Central America presented themselves at the border to apply for asylum under Obama's migration process.That's a total of 117,190 Central American migrants in the 12 months since October 2015, which is almost double the prior year's inflow of 62,720 Central American migrants who used Obama's asylum rule. It also tops the Oct. 2013 to Sept. 2014 inflow of 113,320 Central American migrants. From Oct. 2012, to Sept. 2013, another 22,715 Central Americans walked across the border to seek asylum.That adds up to 305,845 Central American migrants since October 2012.Those numbers exclude large number of border-crossing Mexicans adults, youths and children. Mexicans aren't supposed to be allowed to apply for asylum, and should be quickly returned home, according to administration officials.The numbers also exclude roughly 280,000 illegal immigrants from many countries were caught at the border in the last 12 months. That's up from roughly 275,000 would-be illegals caught in 2015, not counting the 62,720 central Americans who crossed in 2015 seeking asylum.So far, very few of Obama's Central American migrants have been sent home, despite public opinion. That's partly because the GOP-led Congress has not used its spending power to limit Obama's welcome for the migrants. In fact, top GOP leaders welcome the arrival of more foreign workers to work in favored low-wage industries.Before Obama changed the rules in 2010 and 2011, Central American migrants who tried to sneak across the border were routinely sent home by the border patrol. Since Obama quietly changed the rules, migrants from Central American -- chiefly El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala -- are now welcomed across the border to legally begin the years-long process of requesting asylum, and are sent to local bus stations so they move to cities around the nation.While they're waiting for their court dates, Obama allows the migrants to compete against Americans for jobs and also to crowd into already-failing American schools in California and Maryland, Massachusetts and Colorado and many other states. Obama has even set up a process where Central Americans can apply to the local U.S. embassy for approval to migrate into the United States.Obama is a progressive, and he has repeatedly said that Americans have no moral or legal right to restrict migration, and he has repeatedly said that migrants make America better.But he knows his migration is deeply unpopular, so he's only offering the asylum deal to Central Americans under the media-magnified claim that they're fleeing violence. In contrast, the cross-border flow of Mexicans has been kept down, in part, because they're not supposed to be allowed file for asylum. For example, the number of Mexican youths who crossed the border in 2014 was 15,634, and was just 11,926 in 2016.Roughly speaking, if all of the Central American migrants are granted asylum, they will cost American taxpayers more than $192 billion over the next 75 years, Those costs include welfare, wage subsidies and K-12 education for the migrants' children. Very few of the Central American migrants have useful skills for a high-tech economy.Those 75-year costs of the 300,000 migrants could be paid if the federal government were to deposit $69 billion in cash into an interest-bearing bank account this year, according to a recent study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.However, the federal government is already running a huge deficit of $578 billion in 2016. So it will pay the cost of each migrant year-by-year over the next 75 years.That year-by-year payment drives up the cost of each unskilled migrant to roughly $640,000 in spending over the next 75 years, according to an analysis by Robert Rector at the Heritage Foundation.The two formula predict the cost of the 300,000 Central American migrants will be rise from $69 billion if fully paid this year, to above $192 billion if paid year-by-year, according to the National Academies' study and cost-calculator, and Rector's year-by-year analysis.All that spending on migrants is a huge boon for teachers' unions and also business, because it means taxpayers' dollars will be routed via the migrants towards the companies that own shops and restaurants, furniture-makers, auto-sellers and advertising companies. It is also good for Spanish-language media companies, and for media eager to report growing vibrant diversity in the United States.The academies' cost estimate per migrant is buried deep in its new 495-page report, which says the ""75-year present value""  cost estimate for each unskilled immigrant is $231,000, assuming current federal spending plans continue without substantial change.The ""231"" number is found in the right-hand side ""No Budget Adjustments, Total Impact, 25-64"" column.The term, 'present value,' is a way of describing how much money must be deposited in an interest-bearing bank account to pay for the near-term and far-term economic costs of migrants over the next 75 years. That costs include the healthcare, policing, educating and retirement cost of all average migrants. Roughly speaking, it means that every American with a job has to put $660 today into a bank to pay their share of the $102 billion in ""present value"" cost of Obama's migration.The problem with a ""present value"" calculation is that the government does not set aside money in interest-bearing accounts. Instead, it pays the costs year-by-year, aided by a relative trickle of taxes from the new immigrants. Over their lifetime, however, the year-by-year per-person total cost of unskilled migrants balloons to $640,000, says Rector, an economist at the Heritage Foundation. In a recent article, Rector wrote;However, a rough estimate of the future net outlays to be paid by taxpayers (in constant 2012 dollars) for immigrants without a high school diploma appears to be around $640,000 per immigrant over 75 years. The average fiscal loss is around $7,551 per year (in constant 2012 dollars) ... Converting a net present value figure into future outlays requires information on the exact timing of future costs that are not provided by the National Academies. However, a rough estimate of the future net outlays (benefits minus taxes) for the 4 million adult immigrants without a high school degree who have entered the U.S. since 2000 is perhaps $2.6 trillion.Overall, unskilled immigrants now cost state and local governments roughly $1,600 per person per year, says the report.Those fiscal costs co-exist with the salary cuts caused by cheap-labor immigration.The huge scale of legal and illegal immigration over the last few decades has flattened wages and salaries for many Americans. That government-engineered labor supply has flooded the labor market, so imposing an ""immigration tax"" of roughly 5.2 percent, or $500 billion per year, on wages and salaries earned by Americans and establishment immigrants, according to the National Academies' report.In turn, that $500 billion is transferred to the the newest cheap-labor immigrants, and to the employers, investors and shareholders who gain from lower salaries. That 'immigration tax' hits white-collar professionals as well as blue-collar laborers.The Department of Homeland Security press release includes this data for Central American migration. Data about the migration of ""family units"" before 2015 is obscured.The DHS press release also includes two charts showing the rise of the migration. The black lines show the 2016 inflow. However, this data include many Mexicans, who are not supposed to be allowed to claim asylum.

Taylor apparently expressed concern that, in her testimony to the House Oversight Committee, Richards was to stress that Planned Parenthood's ""healthcare"" business was not related to its political lobbying.Hornbrook wrote:Amy Taylor just called me back. After consulting with their lawyers and discussing further internally they are now NOT comfortable moving forward with the event on Monday.

""Plus, if it happens on Monday, the very next day is their digital day of action so we could roll right into that and get a nice bump on digital as well.""In the updated email, Abedin asked, ""They say yes?"" and Latham responded:yep - that's what I pulled Alex from your office about>>>John spoke to Cecile, she was thrilled with the idea, he didn't promise we'd do, said we were thinking about it, had time on Monday probably only an hour / described the roundtable etc and asked for contact so our advance team etc could figure it out""Excellent,"" Abedin replied.Hornbrook then wrote, ""Just spoke with Amy.

Over the years, other parts of the tapes were made public, but some of the contents received little news media attention. Key segments of the tapes have largely not been properly vetted by the news media.In the section of the tape in question, the topic of conversation was a lawsuit filed by former Clinton insider Larry Nichols, who claimed he was improperly dismissed by Clinton from a state job. In the lawsuit, Nichols alleged that Clinton diverted state funds to engage in extramarital affairs with five women, and he named Flowers, Sullivan and three others, including former Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen. Nichols would later drop his lawsuit, but the charges helped form the basis for tabloid stories alleging that Clinton engaged in extramarital affairs.During the recorded conversation with Flowers, Clinton recounted being read the list of women, and he jokes, ""I've got good taste"" and ""I kinda hate to deny that.""Shortly thereafter, Clinton wondered how some of the women made the list. And he made the remark that Sullivan ""darkened my door.""BC: I mean the guys that sort of (inaudible) the whole thing was just sort of weird, you know, who they picked and why. And I couldn't... I mean, I literally have no, and I haven't even... I mean, I've talked to Elizabeth Ward, who got on that list, maybe three times in my whole life.GF: Wow!BC: I don't have any idea how she made the grade.GF: Huh.BC: At least Lencola Sullivan is a friend of mine even though that I don't, haven't ever slept with her. She does come to see me when she's in town, so I can see why, you know (inaudible) she's darkened my door.GF: Well, who knows. You know... You can't, you can't reason. They were just, you know... they picked people that are reasonably high-profile, too, if you'll noticed. Names that people would probably recognize ...which was pretty smart.To ""darken someone's door"" is an idiom that usually means to come to visit or make an appearance. At times the expression is used to refer to an unwanted appearance.At various points in the tape, Clinton mentions he is in direct contact with Sullivan about the affair claims and that Sullivan assured him that she would remain silent.""Not only that,"" he said. ""I mean, this is just crazy. If nobody's...can... there are not going to be any stories; nobody said anything. Lencola told me they tried to call her...""At another point, Clinton mentions Sullivan again:GF .... I haven't talked to anybody.BC: Well, one of these people tried to call Lencola and she didn't call 'em back. Cause she called me the other day to tell me.GF: Well.BC: She said, you know, if they ever get me, I'll talk to them and tell them it's just BS but I don't think I should cooperate with them.In 1997, L.D. Brown, a former Arkansas state trooper who protected Clinton, alleged in a deposition that he had ""heard"" that Clinton had an affair with Sullivan but he could not recall the source of the purported information.Sullivan could not be reached by Breitbart News for comment.Throughout the tapes, meanwhile, Clinton stressed the importance of the women, including Flowers, refusing to speak to the news media.MIKE NELSON/AFP/GettyFlowers says she was Bill Clinton's mistress for 12-plus years.Flowers says she never sought to go public. Her name was put out there against her will as a result of Nichols' lawsuit. Three days after Star Magazine mentioned Flowers as Clinton's alleged mistress, Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared in January 1992 side by side on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied a relationship with Flowers.Clinton later admitted to one sexual encounter with Flowers in a 1998 deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit.After Clinton denied the affair during the 60 Minutes interview, Flowers held a press conference the next day, where excerpts of the tapes were played.Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

""I think Matt was hoping there would be something done on the floor of the convention"" to nominate Kasich over Trump.Despite supporting Trump for a while in public, Becker said that Borges ""about two weeks ago he did a 180 and said he doesn't know if he would even vote for him himself. So I asked him myself, and Matt said I'm not sure"" if he would vote for Trump.Becker said that her county office in Butler County doesn't have needed resources from the state party, including phones.""People want to make calls and do phone-banking but we don't have any phones,"" she said. ""It's been a frustrating couple months.""""Mr. Borges was hired to do a job, elect Republicans. And he is not helping to elect the top Republican on the ticket.""Asked if Trump supporters will fight on in defiance of the state party, Becker said, ""Oh yeah.""Meanwhile, local blog Third Base Politics reports that it has caught Ohio Republican Party (ORP) executive director Katie Eagan running a parody Twitter account attacking Bob Paduchik, Trump's campaign chief in Ohio.

At the 1:43 mark she follows her own comments on Australia's gun ban by saying, ""I think it worth considering doing it on the national level, if that could be arranged.""PolitiFact admits that ""Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns. The government offered a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the firearms at fair-market prices."" They also admit that those who refused to turn in their guns during the ""grace period"" became ""subject to strict penalties"" if caught with the firearm later.In other words-the buyback was not voluntary. Australians had up to a year to turn in their guns, thereafter those who possessed them were criminalized.Yet even after admitting this, PolitiFact points to the fact that Clinton also mentioned ""Cash for Clunkers"" while speaking at Keene State-and because ""Cash for Clunkers"" was a voluntary program, they suggest Clinton was talking about a voluntary national-buyback.They quoted Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin, who said, ""Of course Hillary does not support national mandatory gun buyback programs, including those modeled after Australia's program. She was discussing voluntary buyback programs, which are drastically different than what occurred in Australia and are regularly run by cities across the America.""But the irony is lost on the NRA and others who watched the Keen State town hall. After all, Clinton's statement that Australia's gun ban is ""worth considering"" came about a minute after ""Australia's a good example, Canada's a good example, the UK is a good example"" of how ""stricter gun laws"" were implemented following a high profile gun crime.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Meanwhile, the White House and its allies are using their regulatory powers to revise sentencing guidelines sand so release tens of thousands of criminals back onto the streets.But now Senate majority whip John Cornyn is signaling he's willing to pass the sentencing-rollback bill in 2017, even without a mens rea reform.A reporter covering Cornyn's speech to a local Chamber of Commerce on Oct. 12 noted that the Texas senator will continue to push the sentencing rewrite, even if passage of a controversial law also gives a boost to a new Democratic administration..@JohnCornyn says, regardless of prez elex, one area where parties can come together is criminal justice reform, esp prison reform #txlege-- Sean Walsh (@SeanCWalsh) October 12, 2016In January 2016, Cornyn said he didn't want mens rea reform to stop the SCRA from becoming law. ""I worry that if we begin to add additional things to that legislation, it is going to weigh it down to the point where we will not be able to pass anything this year,"" he said at a Senate hearing.The GOP's top leader in the Senate, Sen. Mitch McConnell, still opposes the rollback bill, say sources.But Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has also repeatedly stated he wants to pass the sentencing rewrite, even as violent crime--particularly murder--rises dramatically, and a heroin epidemic fueled by uncontrolled illegal immigration kills tens of thousands of Americans.Conservatives have slammed Republicans, such as Cornyn, for offering crucial aid for the left, even if Democrats keep control of the White House in 2017.""Republicans like [Cornyn] already have a game plan in place if and when Hillary is elected: make Hillary's presidency a great success,"" wrote conservative critic Daniel Horowitz. ""In other words, nothing too different from the GOP's modus operandi during the Obama presidency.""Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke has harshly criticized the bill as well, saying it would fuel crime, addiction, and dysfunction.""Let me disabuse of the idea of the 'low-level drug offender.' If you're a single mom, living in the American ghetto, and you're doing everything that you can to try to keep your child and your children away from the dope dealer who stands on the corner every day, or runs a dope house just down the street from yours, it is a huge relief for her to have that person taken out of circulation,"" he said at a May press conference. ""'Low-level'? Much of the violent crime we're talking about -- armed robberies, burglaries, drive-by shootings -- are the result of drug war disputes. So forget about the thought of this 'low-level drug offender.'""Middle class and lower-income Americans, including minorities, have become increasingly concerned about crime in their communities: In 2014, 39 percent told Gallup they were worried ""a great deal"" about crime, and only two years later in April 2016, that number rose sharply to 53 percent..@JohnCornyn says, regardless of prez elex, one area where parties can come together is criminal justice reform, esp prison reform #txlege

This is something that has been going on steadily since 1965,"" Eberstadt explained. ""It's almost like a straight line down. And now we have a lower rate of work for men in America than we had in 1940, at the tail end of the Depression. I'm glad that the New York Times finally caught on. Welcome to the party the rest of the world is having.""This sardonic comment was a reference to the New York Times editorial published on Sunday, entitled ""Millions of Men Are Missing from the Job Market."" ""It's obviously a big, enormous change in American life, so there are lots of things involved,"" Eberstadt continued. ""Some of it is change in the economy. Some of it is change in family breakdown. Some of it has to do with the increasing disposition to accept a no-work lifestyle, and to finance it through government and other sources. And part of it is the rise of criminality in America. We now have 20 million ex-cons, people with felonies in their background, who are in the society at large, not behind bars, or one of eight adult guys. It's much more difficult for those people to get back into the mainstream.""He said this crisis is obviously ""not invisible to the people who are suffering from it.""""It's not invisible to people who live in the bottom half of America. If you live in a bubble in Washington, you're in the talking class and the deciding class, you may not know anybody who is affected by it. But yes, it's very evident in America, just not to our elites and our deciders.""Eberstadt said readers of his book will see ""there is now an army of 7 million guys, between the ages of 25 and 54, who are neither working nor looking for work, that there are three times as many of them as unemployed men - guys who are out of a job and actually looking for work, that the guys who are checked out from the economy are also checked out from civil society. They don't do volunteering. They don't do religious activities. They don't even do much in the way of care or help around the house.""""They're spending a full-time 2,000 hours a year or more in front of TV, video, and the Internet,"" he continued. ""We now know some more, of course, about the pain pill aspect of this, but other people knew about that, of course, already, via oxycodone and other opioid explosion.""""The criminality aspect of it, I think, is also important - the huge increase in the number of Americans who have felonies in their background. The government, for some reason, for some unfathomable reason, just has not collected information over the last fifty years on what happens to people once they are out of jail, but also out of trouble. We don't know anything, really, about their health, their income, their living arrangements, or their employment,"" Eberstadt said.He said he was ""pretty light on policies"" in his book, seeking mainly to outline the problem, ""since I want to get lots of people in to recognize the problem and offer their own solutions.""However, he suggested ""three big avenues for government and a couple of avenues outside of government"" to resolve the Men Without Work crisis.""Number one, we've got to revitalize small business,"" he said. ""We now have a net business death environment in America, more businesses closing than opening each year. Obviously, that's part of the problem.""""Number two, we've got a very badly broken government disability system. It incentivizes people for raising their hand and saying they're helpless, rather than having a work-first principle in trying to get people back into the game,"" Eberstadt continued.""Number three, we've got to do something about trying to reintegrate people who have paid their debt to society back into society,"" he urged. ""We don't even have the evidence for evidence-based policies on this."" ""There are lots of things government can do. One of the things government can't do is to fix the broken American family,"" he warned. ""That's something that can only happen in civil society. And another thing related to that is obviously the whole question of faith in America. People of faith can help to create strong communities to get men back to work. I sure wouldn't want a government Ministry of Religion doing this, but I think that people in America can think about this, and see how it goes.""Marlow found it interesting that Eberstadt's work focused on the problems facing men in society, when most of our political debate and cultural conversation is focused on problems facing women ""and how women are just so oppressed in American society.""Eberstadt says he focused solely on men because ""it's the elephant hiding in the room. It's the enormous social problem in America that's connected to so much of the other bad, sad things that are happening to our country.""""It's connected to the slow growth, to the widening of economic gaps, to the bigger budget deficits and greater government dependence, to the lower mobility, to the weaker families. It's almost at the epicenter of so many things that are wrong in America today,"" he said.Eberstadt agreed with the proposition that ""American men, especially of working age, are not a designated victim class, and maybe that's one of the reasons that our friends in the media have not focused on this as much as they should have over the past fifty years.""""It's also true that the bubble in America, as my friend Charles Murray at AEI describes, has become so thick that people in Washington don't know, personally, so many of these millions and millions of people who are affected. If we didn't have that bubble, and we didn't have these preconceptions about victim classes, maybe we would be more effective in looking at the real problems in our country,"" he suggested.Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.LISTEN:SIGN UP""The Invisible Crisis goes back two generations.

""It's obviously a big, enormous change in American life, so there are lots of things involved,"" Eberstadt continued. ""Some of it is change in the economy. Some of it is change in family breakdown. Some of it has to do with the increasing disposition to accept a no-work lifestyle, and to finance it through government and other sources. And part of it is the rise of criminality in America. We now have 20 million ex-cons, people with felonies in their background, who are in the society at large, not behind bars, or one of eight adult guys. It's much more difficult for those people to get back into the mainstream.""He said this crisis is obviously ""not invisible to the people who are suffering from it.""""It's not invisible to people who live in the bottom half of America. If you live in a bubble in Washington, you're in the talking class and the deciding class, you may not know anybody who is affected by it. But yes, it's very evident in America, just not to our elites and our deciders.""Eberstadt said readers of his book will see ""there is now an army of 7 million guys, between the ages of 25 and 54, who are neither working nor looking for work, that there are three times as many of them as unemployed men - guys who are out of a job and actually looking for work, that the guys who are checked out from the economy are also checked out from civil society. They don't do volunteering. They don't do religious activities. They don't even do much in the way of care or help around the house.""""They're spending a full-time 2,000 hours a year or more in front of TV, video, and the Internet,"" he continued. ""We now know some more, of course, about the pain pill aspect of this, but other people knew about that, of course, already, via oxycodone and other opioid explosion.""""The criminality aspect of it, I think, is also important - the huge increase in the number of Americans who have felonies in their background. The government, for some reason, for some unfathomable reason, just has not collected information over the last fifty years on what happens to people once they are out of jail, but also out of trouble. We don't know anything, really, about their health, their income, their living arrangements, or their employment,"" Eberstadt said.He said he was ""pretty light on policies"" in his book, seeking mainly to outline the problem, ""since I want to get lots of people in to recognize the problem and offer their own solutions.""However, he suggested ""three big avenues for government and a couple of avenues outside of government"" to resolve the Men Without Work crisis.""Number one, we've got to revitalize small business,"" he said. ""We now have a net business death environment in America, more businesses closing than opening each year. Obviously, that's part of the problem.""""Number two, we've got a very badly broken government disability system. It incentivizes people for raising their hand and saying they're helpless, rather than having a work-first principle in trying to get people back into the game,"" Eberstadt continued.""Number three, we've got to do something about trying to reintegrate people who have paid their debt to society back into society,"" he urged. ""We don't even have the evidence for evidence-based policies on this."" ""There are lots of things government can do. One of the things government can't do is to fix the broken American family,"" he warned. ""That's something that can only happen in civil society. And another thing related to that is obviously the whole question of faith in America. People of faith can help to create strong communities to get men back to work. I sure wouldn't want a government Ministry of Religion doing this, but I think that people in America can think about this, and see how it goes.""Marlow found it interesting that Eberstadt's work focused on the problems facing men in society, when most of our political debate and cultural conversation is focused on problems facing women ""and how women are just so oppressed in American society.""Eberstadt says he focused solely on men because ""it's the elephant hiding in the room. It's the enormous social problem in America that's connected to so much of the other bad, sad things that are happening to our country.""""It's connected to the slow growth, to the widening of economic gaps, to the bigger budget deficits and greater government dependence, to the lower mobility, to the weaker families. It's almost at the epicenter of so many things that are wrong in America today,"" he said.Eberstadt agreed with the proposition that ""American men, especially of working age, are not a designated victim class, and maybe that's one of the reasons that our friends in the media have not focused on this as much as they should have over the past fifty years.""""It's also true that the bubble in America, as my friend Charles Murray at AEI describes, has become so thick that people in Washington don't know, personally, so many of these millions and millions of people who are affected. If we didn't have that bubble, and we didn't have these preconceptions about victim classes, maybe we would be more effective in looking at the real problems in our country,"" he suggested."

Robert Spitzer, S.J., in designing the free-to-use resource.""The Catholic Curriculum Standards are only supplemental standards and are able to be used in addition to any set of typical academic standards common in most schools,"" Guernsey tells Breitbart News. ""These are supplemental standards that address what Catholic schools should be doing 'in addition to' what is already present in most standards and textbooks.""""While we do not recommend use of the common core, it is possible with much thought, adaptation, and revision of the Common Core to use these in addition to it to try to make the best of things,"" he explains. ""We recommend adding these Catholic standards to more successful and proven academic standards such as those developed by Dr. Sandra Stotsky.""Stotsky is a vocal critic of the Common Core standards and is credited with developing one of the country's strongest sets of academic standards for K-12 students while serving as senior associate commissioner in the Massachusetts Department of Education from 1999-2003. Though invited to be a member of the Common Core Validation Committee in 2009, Stotsky refused to sign off on what are now highly unpopular standards.""We also recommend using original texts and chapter books and staying away from anthologies or pre-packaged reading programs, as the problems with modern secular education and textbooks preceded the development of the Common Core and will sadly remain after it is but an unhappy memory,"" Guernsey says.Donohue also tells Breitbart News, ""While supplemental standards, they are also foundational standards for Catholic schools to use as a guide to selecting the most appropriate standards to advance their mission.""The Catholic standards and their accompanying list of recommended resources propose to Catholic educators what students in Catholic schools should be taught in English language arts, math, science and history - beyond what is now being taught in secular schools.The release of the new standards comes on the heels of the publication of a study by Pioneer Institute and American Principles Project titled ""After the Fall: Catholic Education Beyond the Common Core."" The authors of that project - some of whom also consulted on the Newman Society standards - concluded that the ""workforce development"" goal of the Common Core is incompatible with the higher goals of Catholic education.In place of Common Core, the study's authors recommend building upon ""the long Catholic educational tradition, including recent Church and papal writings, to present a positive foundation for moving Catholic schools forward in a post-Common Core world.""They continue:The workforce educational model currently being promoted by the government relies heavily on the concept of training. It aims to train students in certain skills of information-processing and mathematical abilities that transfer rather directly to today's world of work. Training consists of learning how to accomplish a task and ""getting the job done."" At the heart of the Common Core agenda is a century-old dream of Progressive educators to redirect education's mission away from engaging the young in the best of human thought and focusing instead on preparation for ""real life."" While a reasonable but quite secondary goal, workforce-development is dwarfed by Catholic schools' transcendent goals of human excellence, spiritual transformation, and preparation for ""the next life"" as well.Guernsey and Donohue say in a statement about the Catholic curriculum's design:The standards cover English language arts, math, scientific topics, and history, focusing on unique Catholic insights into these curricular areas and complementing the Church's standards for religious instruction. They are broadly grouped into two grade levels, K-6 and 7-12. They express student outcomes of learning, inviting educators to assign or develop materials and choose subject matter that serve the unique mission of Catholic education.We built the standards on the solid foundation of Church documents, the educational philosophies of faithful Newman Guide colleges, and many writings on Catholic, liberal arts, and classical education. We consulted with many leading Catholic scholars, school leaders, and standards experts to ensure the highest quality resource.The Cardinal Newman Society has joined many Catholic parents and educators in raising serious concerns about the Common Core's suitability for Catholic schools.In 2013, with approximately 100 out of 195 Catholic dioceses in the United States embracing Common Core for its schools, more than 130 Catholic scholars sent a letter to the U.S. Catholic bishops requesting that they abandon any implementation of the Common Core standards.The letter read:Promoters of Common Core say that it is designed to make America's children ""college and career ready."" We instead judge Common Core to be a recipe for standardized workforce preparation. Common Core shortchanges the central goals of all sound education and surely those of Catholic education: to grow in the virtues necessary to know, love, and serve the Lord, to mature into a responsible, flourishing adult, and to contribute as a citizen to the process of responsible democratic self-government.In fact, we are convinced that Common Core is so deeply flawed that it should not be adopted by Catholic schools which have yet to approve it, and that those schools which have already endorsed it should seek an orderly withdrawal now.""For too long, many Catholic schools have relied heavily on secular government standards like the Common Core to measure school success and on similarly focused standardized tests to measure student outcomes,"" says the Newman Society. ""These distract Catholic educators from their core mission, because they ignore key aspects of human formation and often depend on philosophies of education that are contrary to the Catholic faith.""Guernsey notes that, thus far, two Catholic dioceses are using the new standards to launch discussion of standards in their schools.The workforce educational model currently being promoted by the government relies heavily on the concept of training. It aims to train students in certain skills of information-processing and mathematical abilities that transfer rather directly to today's world of work.
