SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThat means the voters who cast their ballots on election day are more likely to be independent, pro-GOP and working age, says the survey of 2,263 people who have already voted by mail or in person. The Democratic skew towards early voting is highlighted by a chart showing how the early voters tend to trust Hillary Clinton more than Donald Trump on a variety of issues.The nation's growing polarization under President Barack Obama -- who ran in 2008 promising unity, hope and change --  is shown by the number of voters sho say they are very unhappy with their choice of candidates. According to the Morning Consult statement, Despite winning on the issues, nearly a third of early voters (including 66 percent of Republicans) say they will be ""scared"" if Clinton wins the election. But that number is 15 points higher for Trump, at 46 percent (including 73 percent of Democrats).

The Field Poll reveals the Attorney General leads in all major regions of the state, among both men and women, across voters in all age ranges and educational backgrounds.Sanchez only holds a 1 point advantage over Harris among Republicans and conservative voters. Given that over half of those voters do not expect to vote for any Senate candidate on November 8, Sanchez has the backing of only about one in four Republicans and conservatives.With 2 years to go in the Attorney General's term if Harris is victorious, Governor Brown would be kingmaker - subject to confirmation by the Democrat controlled Legislature - to pick a successor for one of the state's most powerful and influential positions. He would also give a Democrat the huge advantage of incumbency for the 2018 election campaign.The last statewide gubernatorial appointments were Arnold Schwarzenegger nominating Bruce McPherson as Secretary of State in 2005 and Abel Maldonado as Lieutenant Governor in 2010. Both lost to Democrats in subsequent elections, with McPherson losing to Debra Bowen in 2006 and Maldonado losing to Gavin Newsom in 2010.Democrat strategist Katie Merrill told the Los Angeles Times, ""I would think that the governor would make less of a political decision and more of a decision of who could step in and run the office and hit the ground running on day one.""But Brown could also use the Attorney General appointment to clear a pathway to the 2018 governorship, when he is termed out of office. Both Brown, his father Pat Brown, and Republican George Deukmejian all successfully used the Attorney General office as a stepping-stone to the governor's mansion.The viable candidates in the governor's race - Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Treasurer John Chiang, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer - would all appreciate Brown picking a ""caretaker"" attorney general, happy with keeping that job.The rumor mill seems to expect Brown to appoint Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg as Attorney General. Steinberg served as President Pro Tem of the California Senate from 2008 to 2014, when the legislature suffered several corruption scandals. He is a huge Brown ally and has stated a desire to get back into state politics.But there are also whispers that Brown could defy the state's constitutional term limits forcing him out of office in 2018 by appointing his wife, Anne Gust Brown, as Attorney General. She is a former corporate attorney with sterling legal credentials.Gust Brown was Brown's most influential aide during both his governorship and his previous stint as attorney general. Jerry Brown is by far the most powerful Democrat fundraiser in California. With Brown's cash machine and their shared deep power within the party, Gust Brown would quickly become the odds-on favorite to be the next governor.SIGN UP"	['Sanchez', 'Harris', 'Boxer']	[]

Ryan.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe closed-door, May 12, 2016 meeting at the RNC's headquarters in Washington between Trump and Ryan featured scores of supposed anti-Trump protesters outside being filmed by the news media.The news media largely featured the protesters as legitimate anti-Trump activists.The email captured by Wikileaks, however, betrays a different story.The May 10, 2016 correspondence was titled, ""Action in front of RNC on Thursday morning for Trump/Ryan meeting.""In the message, Eric Walker, Deputy Communications Director at the DNC, discussed staging protests at the RNC's headquarters in Washington during the meeting between Trump and Ryan.The email, sent to two other DNC staffers, reveals Walker suggested ideas for anti-Trump signs to be brandished by the alleged protesters:We should come up with signs to pass out. A few ideas (throw some ideas down here if you have them):* Reject the Trump-Ryan Agenda*Donald Trump: Dangerous, Divisive, Disgraceful (my favorite)*Dump Trump*Love Trumps Hate (HFA tagline)* Say No to Bigotry / Say No to Trump* Trump = Make America Hate Again (2nd choice)Walker further relates he ""discussed"" planning for the purported protest with Creamer.He writes:Discussed with Creamer, et. al. today.We are calling through allied groups to get some folks out front of the RNC before 9 a.m.There will be a separate action in front of the NRSC at 11:30 with the message being ""Don't Let Republicans Trump the Supreme Court"" - mostly being handled by woodhouse / groups that have been engaged on SCOTUS push.The supposed protest outside the RNC meeting made headlines.The Washington Post published a story on the event that included video of a handful of supposed anti-Trump protesters outside the RNC confab brandishing anti-Trump placards.The Hill reported on the purported protestors: ""The scene outside Republican National Committee (RNC) headquarters on Thursday was chaotic, with protesters and supporters of Donald Trump showing up in response to the presumptive presidential nominee's meeting with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).""""Protesters, Media Outside Trump-Ryan Meeting,"" was the title of a USA Today online video of the event.NPR reported that ""Colorful protests surrounded Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., Thursday morning as Donald Trump met with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other officials inside.""Creamer, meanwhile, stepped back from his responsibilities working with the campaign after a video released by James O'Keefe and his organization, Project Veritas Action, reportedly showed the Democratic operative hiring people to protest at Trump events and allegedly to incite violence.Creamer's associations with Clinton's presidential campaign came in the form of activism on behalf of his organization, Democracy Partners, a progressive consulting group, and Creamer's position as leader of Mobilize, which was contracted with the DNC.Following O'Keef's video, Creamer released a statement that he is ""unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing Hilary Clinton, and defeating Donald Trump in the upcoming election... As a result I have indicated to the Democratic National Committee that I am stepping back from my responsibilities working with the campaign.""Creamer told CNN that he was referring to work for Clinton's campaign, and he confirmed to the news agency that he was ""fully integrated"" with the campaign.Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Not the [person receiving the gun], but the person who failed to go to a gun shop.He said these things after first admitting he had initially supported Question 1-then he read it. Upon reading it he realized the onus would be on the soldier who was leaving the gun; that the soldier would be guilty for not going to a gun store to get government approval to leave a gun with his fiancee or friend.Wynn said he also discovered that Question 1 could cancel gun purchases for persons who have been accused of crimes, ""but not convicted."" And it could also stop recreational marijuana users from making private gun purchases.On August 31 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a ban on gun sales to marijuana card holders is constitutional. Form 4473 of the background check process asks if the would-be firearm purchaser is ""an unlawful user of...marijuana."" No one who answers ""yes"" to that question can purchase a gun.Wynn is simply observing that by expanding the instances in which background checks occur, Nevadans will be unwittingly diminishing the number of people who will be able to exercise Second Amendment rights. Ironically, Wynn's comments come a day before Nevadans also get to vote on Question 2, an initiative to legalize recreational marijuana in Nevada.People who vote ""yes"" for Question 1 and Question 2 may be surprised to learn that Question 1 will block the exercise of their Second Amendment rights if they smoke the marijuana they voted to legalize.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

The graffiti is on a wall facing one of the facility's parking lots.The violent message was so disgusting, even a Hilary supporter called it ""ridiculous.""""I think it's ridiculous. It's violent and unnecessary,"" Hillary voter Lovett-Perkins told the paper. ""I think it's overkill on how we view each other as people. It's outrageous where we've gotten to as a nation.""Massachusetts State Representative Geoff Diehl told the Herald that this sort of violence from the left has become all too common this year.""It's been a disturbing trend in this presidential cycle,"" Diehl said, ""that there's been people recruited from the left to attack Trump rallies and now we're seeing what is turning into desperation on the side of the Clinton campaign to bully Trump voters into not coming out on Tuesday.""This type of graffiti is only par for the course as the left ramps up attacks against Trump supporters across the country. Not only have businesses and private homes been defaced by anti-Trump property destruction, so, too, have many GOP and Trump campaign offices across the nation.In the last few months, several campaign offices have been defaced by liberals angry over the election. Most recently the GOP office in Denver, Colorado, was defaced twice in the same day. In addition, two offices in North Carolina were attacked, one in Allamance County and the other in Hillsborough. Outrageously, the Hillsborough campaign office was firebombed and destroyed by anti-Trumpers.Violence against Trump supporters and vandalism of homes has also been common this campaign season. Reports have been seen of attacks on individuals, including a shocking video showing two young, white Trump fans being attacked and beaten by a large group of Hispanics in California.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Warner']	[]

Terry McAuliffe has illegally granted voting rights to 60,000 convicted felons in the key swing state of Virginia, a move that could give Hillary Clinton a victory in that state--and possibly the White House--unless supporters of Donald Trump get out to the polls on Election Day.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLike many states, the Virginia Constitution provides that if a person commits a felony, with their lawbreaking, they forfeit the right to vote for candidates who will make and enforce those laws. But it also grants the Virginia governor clemency power to pardon criminals and commute sentences, including the power to restore voting rights.But Gov. Terry McAuliffe--one of Hillary Clinton's oldest and most loyal supporters--declared on April 22 of this year that he was using this pardon power to restore voting rights to 206,000 convicted felons in Virginia. This was a political bombshell, because felons vote overwhelmingly in favor of Democrats, and Virginia is a swing state (made all the more so by Clinton's tapping Sen. Tim Kaine from that state as her running mate).Virginia lawmakers sued, and the Virginia Supreme Court held in Howell v. McAuliffe that the Clinton ally's political move was an unprecedented power grab that previous governors of both parties had acknowledged was illegal.Among other things, Virginia Chief Justice Donald Lemons wrote that ""power could be exercised only in particular cases to named individuals for whom a specific grant of executive clemency is sought,"" and only after an individualized assessment of the felon's case and character.In response to this stinging rebuke by his state's highest court, McAuliffe granted 13,000 restorations anyway, claiming he had somehow examined all of those cases in just a few days, and promised to restore as many as possible before Election Day. He also sent voter registration information to each of these criminals accompanying their letter of pardon.Incredulous at McAuliffe's brazen defiance of the Virginia Supreme Court, lawmakers in the Old Dominion filed a motion asking for the governor to be held in contempt of court, but the Virginia court backed down from this assault on its authority to interpret the supreme law of the state, and denied the motion without a hearing or an explanation.Continuing unabashed in his efforts to mint Democratic voters, as of last week, McAuliffe had illegally granted voting rights to 60,000 serious criminals in Virginia. It is not yet known how many felons registered or will cast a ballot, but with Trump and Clinton statistically tied in Virginia, these criminals could make all the difference.There are multiple ways for Trump to win the White House without Virginia, but in a close election neither candidate is taking anything for granted.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

However, moments before he spoke, Trump's campaign manager, veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway, tweeted the results of a poll that have Trump one point ahead of Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania.#PA #poll: #Pennsylvania, @trfgrp Poll (11/3-5)Trump 48% (+1)

This agrees with a 2012 Congressional Research Services (CRS) report showing the firearm-related homicide rate in the U.S. fell sharply as private gun ownership began soaring post-1994.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMore recently-on October 22-The Telegraph reported that the U.S. is number one on the list of Top 10 countries for private gun ownership, yet the U.S. does not even crack the Top 10 list for countries with most firearm deaths.Synopsis: UNODC presents U.S. as approximately 92nd in the world for homicides, CRS reports rate of homicides in U.S. began falling sharply as gun ownership expanded post-1994, and the Telegraph shows U.S. does not even crack the Top 10 of countries with most firearm deaths.But here comes CNN, countering all this information by claiming the U.S. has ""one of the highest rates of death by firearm in the developed world."" They try to bolster this claim with a link to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) chart based on the work of debunked Harvard researcher David Hemenway. And John Lott Jr. points out that CNN relies on the Small Arms Survey as well, which means the number of guns owned in the U.S. versus other countries is skewed to begin with.Moreover, Lott's Crime Research Prevention Center (CRPC) points out that CNN's total of U.S. gun deaths includes suicides, which makes the actual number of homicides appear ""70%"" higher than they really are.CRPC reports:CNN makes the completely false claim that the US has ""one of the world's highest rates of death by firearms.""  Note most countries don't report their firearm homicide rates, and there are many other problems that make the US's rate look worse compared to other countries...Admittedly the CNN claim is based on total firearm deaths and most of those are suicides in the US, but the firearm homicide rates are so massive in other parts of the world that they swamp firearm suicides in the US.CRPC explains, ""If you use murders (not homicides that include justifiable homicides), suicides account for about 70% of firearm deaths in the US.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

She neglects, however, to mention any of the accusations of sexual predation and cover-up aimed at Hillary Clinton and her husband.Not to mention the allegations of sexual exploitation lodged against Planned Parenthood itself. Writing at National Review, Lila Rose, president of pro-life organization Live Action, observes:For nearly ten years, our team at Live Action has investigated Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry. During our investigations, we exposed Planned Parenthood facilitating the sexual exploitation of minors and covering up human trafficking. We've watched as Planned Parenthood deceptively counseled women with false medical information to convince them to have abortions to boost its bottom line. We've seen Planned Parenthood promote child sexual abuse, dangerous sex advice to children, and gendercide.Richards, however, stands to lose federal funding for her business and restrictions on the primary service she offers, should Trump be elected. The president of the abortion industry giant writes about Trump:He wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If this happens, those under 26 will no longer be guaranteed coverage under their parents' plans. Insurance companies will no longer be required to cover birth control with no copay, which costs one person up to $600 per year just on birth control pills. Preventive care -- like cancer screenings and annual exams -- will no longer be guaranteed without out-of-pocket costs. And over 20 millions Americans could lose their health care altogether.At the same time, he is attacking providers who support communities by providing low-cost care. Both Donald Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, have vowed to defund Planned Parenthood. What this really means is that millions of women who rely on critical federal health programs will lose access to breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, well-woman exams, and other preventive care at Planned Parenthood health centers. For many, these health centers are the only health-care provider they will see all year.According to Planned Parenthood's own 2014-2015 annual report, however, while taxpayer funding of the abortion business was increased last year, the group's total number of services dropped by 11 percent. The ""cancer screenings"" and other preventive services have fallen by 27 percent in just one year, and by 57 percent since 2010. Similarly, Planned Parenthood's contraceptive services dropped by almost 18 percent in just one year.As for 20 million Americans who ""could lose their health care altogether,"" it's become obvious to most Americans many of these ""newly insured"" largely have health insurance cards, but little, if any, access to real health care. This has been accomplished by the fact that major health insurers have either left Obamacare or have managed their costs by severely restricting health ""choices"" to customers. For someone who seems to value the word ""choice,"" Richards is quick to disregard it when it comes to saving her abortion chain's federal funding.Richards and her comrades in the abortion industry want low-income American women to believe they won't be able to obtain birth control, ""cancer screenings,"" and other ""preventive services"" if Planned Parenthood is defunded. The fact is there are 13,000 Federally Qualified Health Centers that provide more comprehensive medical services without performing abortions - a figure that outnumbers Planned Parenthood facilities by 20 to 1.Planned Parenthood's CEO, however, says Hillary Clinton's fight to expand abortion services is what most women want, and the proof is that in the last presidential debate, ""according to a CNN focus group...the most favored moment of the entire debate"" was Clinton's ""embrace"" of ""reproductive rights.""""For the generation coming of age now, there's a lot at stake in this election,"" Richards writes. ""Put simply, it's a choice about what kind of country we want to be, what kind of future we want for this generation and the next one. Do we want a president who has worked her entire career to expand opportunities for women and families, who has made the health and well-being of children her priority?""Clinton, however, is clearly not concerned about the ""health and well-being"" of unborn children. She has said unborn persons have no constitutional rights, that she would work to repeal the longstanding Hyde Amendment, forcing Americans to pay for more abortions for black and Hispanic women through the Medicaid program. Clinton also vows to appoint pro-abortion Supreme Court justices.Nevertheless, a recent Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll found a full 81 percent of Americans favor some restrictions on abortion -- including limiting the procedure after the first three months -- and a continued ban on public funding of abortion.In the survey of 1,700 Americans, even 66 percent of respondents who identify themselves as pro-choice say, ""Abortion should be allowed, at most, in the first trimester, in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, or never permitted.""For nearly ten years, our team at Live Action has investigated Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry. During our investigations, we exposed Planned Parenthood facilitating the sexual exploitation of minors and covering up human trafficking.

John Fields said between 30 and 50 voter registrations from both schools were late in arriving at the Glynn County Board of Elections due to Hurricane Matthew.The report, sent to Breitbart News, states Glynn County board of education member Venus Holmes had contacted assistant superintendent Dr. Jim Pulos about the NAACP's request to assist with a student registration drive.As a result of Holmes contacting Pulos, the NAACP was permitted to set up voter registration at Glynn Academy.Shierling reports that in the Facebook photo below, from the account of the Glynn County Democrat Party, two of the women seated at the table during the voter registration drive on September 27 are current Glynn County board of education members Holmes and Democrat candidate for the board of education Linda Bobbitt:""Democrat write-in candidate for the First Congressional District Seat, Nathan Russo, is standing behind the women,"" writes Shierling. ""In posted comments, Democrat Party Chair Audrey Gibbons thanks those in the photo for their efforts with the Party's GOTV (Get Out the Vote).""According to Dr. Scott Spence, principal of Glynn Academy, the regular student voter registration procedure is handled by the social studies department at the school each year in April.Spence reportedly added that the district has no policy regarding student voter registration drives and - as far as he knows - no third party group has ever requested to conduct a voter registration drive within the school.""When asked why did the school system allow a third party (NAACP) to leave campus with students' registrations and personal data, Dr. Spence said, 'We handed the voter registration forms to a BOE member, Venus Holmes,'"" says the report.About 25 student voter registration forms were reportedly handed to Holmes from seniors who completed them in economics and literature classes because, according to Spence, seniors leave campus during lunch and would not likely be attending the NAACP lunchtime voter drive.Holmes said she handed the registration forms to candidate Russo, who was to turn them over to Rev. Fields. However, Fields said he kept the forms from September 27 and 28 in his church office and that the board of elections did not receive them until October 13, two days after the deadline, because they were included with forms from other voter registration drives and he wanted to hand them in all at once.Another situation, however, has raised more concern about the student registration drives.Shierling reports that one parent of a Glynn Academy senior was alarmed when her teen called her, concerned about being asked to sign a voter registration form on November 1.Jolee Benoit said her daughter was asked to complete the voter registration form in classes on November 1 and backdate the form to September 26. The teen called her mother, expressing concern that she was being asked to backdate and sign a form that also warned it is a felony to ""knowingly give false information in registering.""""Thankfully, my child was smart enough to call me before signing,"" Benoit told the Islander. ""Most students would go forth with whatever the school is advising.""She added that when she called the school about the concern, she was told the NAACP and/or the Democrat Party had conducted the drive in September and that ""the directive to backdate the forms came from a higher up on the Glynn County Board of Education and that the Board of Elections would accept the backdated forms.""The Islander reports the state says it will investigate the matter for potential violation of the rules for voter registration by private groups. Patty Gibson, board of elections secretary, told Shierling the late applications will be held until after Election Day and then entered into the voting system.""The bottom line is that no one who registered in September to vote at either Glynn Academy or Brunswick High School either in class or at the NAACP registration drive is eligible to vote on November 8,"" concludes Spierling.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

All the ingredients have fallen perfectly into place for ""Trexit,"" our own version of Brexit starring Donald Trump.My final prediction? It's the same one I told personally to Donald Trump a week ago. I was opening speaker at Trump's rally in Las Vegas in front of 10,000 fans. When I saw Donald backstage I told him, ""Here's my prediction...You will win by a 10-point landslide...but Democrats cheat by 8 points...so the final official election results will show you won by 2.""My prediction is based on three things: Brexit, Goldman Sachs and what I call the ANGRY WHITE ELECTORATE effect. Let's start with Goldman Sachs.It was only two weeks ago that Goldman Sachs actually felt the need to issue a report arguing this was not Brexit.It was very clear to me at that moment, the very fact that the most powerful and politically-connected company on Wall Street felt the need to publicly debunk the Brexit angle was proof positive this was in fact Brexit.Here's the safest bet in life- when the powerful and connected of DC, or Wall Street, or the mainstream media, deny anything, you know it's 100 percent true. Ask Hillary about her deleted emails, or Benghazi, or the Clinton Foundation, or whether she rigged the Democrat primary against Bernie Sanders. When they strongly deny, they always lie.But I digress. Back to the Goldman Sachs report. Their argument two weeks ago was simple: this could not be Brexit because Brexit was closer in the polls than Trump. They claimed that Trump was losing badly.In every poll before the shocking Brexit result, Brexit was trailing by an average of 4.4 points. But a few million white working class voters either weren't on the pollsters radar, or weren't talking publicly about their vote. Brexit shocked the pollsters and ""experts"" and won.Skip ahead to today. Trump trails by 2, 3, or 4 in every single poll- ABC, CBS, Fox, Rasmussen, Bloomberg. The Real Clear Politics average of all polls shows Hillary leads by 2.6 points.Hey Goldman, don't look now, but that's dramatically LOWER than the 4.4 point average before Brexit.None of this takes into account the most accurate poll of 2012 that predicted Obama's victory exactly on the number. The IBD/TIPP poll reports Trump UP by 2 points nationally as of today. The USC/LA Times poll (the only poll to factor in enthusiasm and intensity) has Trump UP by 5 points.I've made two predictions since day one. First that there is a 5-point ""Hidden Trump factor"" missing from every poll. There is 5 percent of the population that is unwilling or embarrassed to say in public (in the face of nonstop biased-liberal media derision) that they support Trump. Add in that 5 percent and Trump wins the election, now that every poll is within 2 to 4 points. I disagreed with Goldman Sachs two weeks ago, but they are clearly dead wrong today. This is our version of Brexit.My second prediction was that Trump would win based on the biggest turnout of white voters in history, combined with low turnout for blacks. Both patterns appear to be happening based on early voting patterns.I wrote the book ""ANGRY WHITE MALE."" I predicted the greatest turnout of angry white working class and middle class males in history. I was only partially correct. At last Sunday's Trump rally in Las Vegas the audience was 60 percent or more white women. Trump is loved by white males, but it appears white females feel the same way. This isn't the ANGRY WHITE MALE election. It's the ANGRY WHITE ELECTORATE election. Both white men and women will come out in record numbers for Trump.I have predicted from day one that black voters can't stand Hillary and would never come out for her in the same numbers they voted for Obama. If black turnout is down substantially, Trump wins. Its all about turnout, which is precisely why the USC/LA times poll shows Trump up by 5 points.Now we come to the electoral college. Elections aren't won by popular vote. They are won state by state. If Trump wins Ohio, Florida and North Carolina, it's over for Democrats. It's that simple. Trump is winning or within 1 point in all three crucial battleground states.But Trump is also winning, tied or very close in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico. Mitt Romney lost all of those states. Trump could win all of them. But if he wins only half, plus Ohio and either Florida or North Carolina, he's the President of the United States.The best sign of all that Trump is on his way to a Brexit victory is the mock presidential election in Minnesota- one of our five most ultra-liberal states. High school kids across the state gave Trump a 34-32 victory a few days ago. In Minnesota!Something special and shocking is happening folks. The mainstream media, Democrats, government and mainstream media haven't a clue what's about to hit them.I call it Trexit.My final prediction: Trump wins by 10, Democrats cheat by 8, he wins by 2.SIGN UP"	['Trump', 'Sanders', 'Romney', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]

I have lost nearly all of my photography business in my home town because liberals here do not agree with me supporting Mr. Trump. I estimate that I have lost over $30,000 -40,000 in my construction business because of the time I have taken to do the events. All I know is I support Mr Trump 100% and will do all I can to help him get elected. I have sold things and borrowed money at times so I could drive to the events.





On January 15, 2015, my mom, 73 years old, died in a nursing home because part of her medication was taken due to Obamacare changes. My sister died on July 18, 2015, because of the Obamacare rules. She was 52 and had two doctors tell her four days before her death that she would die without a particular respiratory test. Her oxygen to her brain was being cut off and Obamacare did not consider this an emergency and declined the test. When Obamacare went into effect, the cost of my personal healthcare insurance increased by over $500 a month so I was left with no healthcare coverage. 





This makes me proud to know I am doing my part to get Mr Trump elected. I had worked for 2 local (liberal) newspapers for over 13 years and now they refuse to print any of my photos because I openly support Mr. Trump. I know Mr. Trump is the only person that can save our country and our future depends on him being elected.






My goal is to photograph Mr. Trump as our next president. Celebrating victory on election night in New York City is going be an exciting conclusion to my small role in this campaign.

""The occupation government is striving to politically assassinate Abbas and to blacken his good name in preparation for his physical elimination.""Official PA daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida published an editorial last week directly linking recent remarks made by Israeli Minister of Defense Avigdor Liberman - to whom the article refers to as the ""Israeli Minister of Death"" - and the impending murder.""Israeli Minister of Death (sic., Minister of Defense) Avigdor Liberman gave an extensive political interview to the Al-Quds newspaper... in which he attacked [PA] President Mahmoud Abbas and called to 'replace him' with a new leadership,"" the editorial read.""Anyone who will go back and review what happened to the late president, the symbol Yasser Arafat... can understand the Israeli method of dealing with the Palestinian leaders in general and with the decision makers in particular. There is no need to remind the Palestinians and the Israelis of the cruel campaign against the symbol Yasser Arafat, until he was brought for burial after being poisoned by the Israeli intelligence and the mercenary henchmen,"" it concluded.In the same paper, Fatah Revolutionary Council member and Director-General of the PA Commission for Information and Culture Muwaffaq Matar described the alleged assassination attempt in greater detail, warning against ""the political assassination operation, after which will come the physical assassination of [PA] President and Commander-in-Chief Mahmoud Abbas as part of the preparation for the assassination of the spirit of the national project.""""The Israeli statements regarding President Abbas are most dangerous and testify to an Israeli plot in the region and exploitation of the situation in order to eliminate Abbas politically and physically.""SIGN UP"	['Israel']	[]
