After all, the Heller decision was simply a reaffirmation of the Founding Father's conviction that America's have an individual right to keep and bear arms, but Clinton believes the Supreme Court got it wrong.According to The Guardian, Clinton's opposition to Heller has gun owners fearful that ""she will re-open the door for cities and states to ban private ownership of handguns."" And such a fear is not unfounded when you consider the fact that the Heller ruling overturned the Washington, D.C. handgun ban.Moreover, Chicago v McDonald (2010) followed, overturning the handgun ban in Chicago as well.Clinton opposes both decisions.On August 23, author and Conservative Leaders for Education chairman William Bennett warned:[Heller and McDonald] were each decided by just one vote. Given the opportunity, a liberal Court wouldn't hesitate to overturn those decisions. We got a glimpse of this in June, when the notoriously liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Second Amendment does not permit the public to carry concealed firearms. A liberal Supreme Court would certainly uphold this ruling and continue to hack away at the rest of the Second Amendment.The Guardian article indicates gun owners have no reason to reject warnings like the one issued by Bennett, and this is largely because Clinton and/or members of her campaign have said as much themselves.Because of this, the Guardian wonders aloud ""why Clinton has taken a more aggressive line in questioning Heller than mainstream gun control groups have done."" And they point out that gun owners are not fooled when Clinton tries to sell herself as pro-Second Amendment at this point in the race. They quote UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, who said, ""If you were to say, 'I support abortion rights, but I'm for overturning Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey,' then what kind of abortion rights are you supporting?""Volokh's point: Clinton opposes Heller, McDonald, ""assault weapon"" ownership, ""high capacity"" magazine ownership, and gun sales as they have been done since 1791. It is not logical to believe someone who holds these positions can also be pro-Second Amendment.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

""That is unacceptable.""Carter did not release a timeframe for the suspension, but said it would be in place until he was ""satisfied that our process is working effectively.""California National Guard officials offered soldiers re-enlistment bonuses of $15,000 or more because of a troop shortage at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars through a Recruiting Assistance Program.In 2010, the Obama Administration conducted an investigation that determined there was a problem with RAP enlistments where thousands of dollars in ""improper payments"" were made to California National Guard soldiers.

The ads have a six-figure buy behind them, and are running on Facebook, YouTube, and Google aiming for undecided voters in swing states, according to a release.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe first ad, ""She Knows Putin Too Well,"" walks through how Hillary Clinton knows Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, ""a little too well.""""Hillary Clinton talks tough on Russia for the cameras and the crowds, but privately, she chose to personally profit from a deal with Putin - by arranging the sale of twenty percent of United States' uranium to Russia. Hillary Clinton feigns outrage over the actions of other countries' horrific human rights records while the Clinton Foundation rakes in cash from those same foreign governments,"" Hogan Gidley, Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC's communications director, said in a statement. ""Hillary recently bragged about having 'both a public and private position' on issues. What's shocking is that her private positions are this hypocritical, this corrupt, this greedy, and this dangerous.""The Putin ad includes a headline from the New York Times from April 2015 from reporters Jo Becker and Mike McIntire that states clearly, ""Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal."" That Times piece, which was based partially on Peter Schweizer's bestselling book Clinton Cash but independently verified and expanded upon by the Times, details how Hillary Clinton is responsible for letting Putin obtain control of a fifth of the United States' uranium deposits. Becker and McIntire wrote that ""Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, had taken over a Canadian company with uranium-mining stakes stretching from Central Asia to the American West"" back in 2013, a deal celebrated in the Russian propaganda media Pravda:""The deal made Rosatom one of the world's largest uranium producers and brought Mr. Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain,"" Becker and McIntire wrote in the New York Times. ""But the untold story behind that story is one that involves not just the Russian president, but also a former American president and a woman who would like to be the next one. At the heart of the tale are several men, leaders of the Canadian mining industry, who have been major donors to the charitable endeavors of former President Bill Clinton and his family. Members of that group built, financed and eventually sold off to the Russians a company that would become known as Uranium One.""The Times reported that not only did Hillary Clinton herself, as secretary of state, sign off on the deal--but that Bill Clinton, her husband and the former president, was greased up with cash from the Russians while all this went down.Becker and McIntire wrote:Beyond mines in Kazakhstan that are among the most lucrative in the world, the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies. Among the agencies that eventually signed off was the State Department, then headed by Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.They went on to assert:As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One's chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well. And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.Now that this ad is out, this story, one of the biggest of this election that hasn't been told, will find its way into the hearts and minds of swing voters.The other ad, ""Pay-to-Play,"" goes in depth into more elements of Clinton Cash corruption, hammering Bill Clinton for the paid speeches and Hillary Clinton for her actions that occurred simultaneously at the State Department:Beyond mines in Kazakhstan that are among the most lucrative in the world, the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States.

6	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/26/cnbc-misleads-renewable-energy/	CNBC Misleads on Renewable Energy	"CNBC viewers are being snookered.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe business news network featured an article in the ""Sustainable Energy"" section of its Website that proclaimed: ""Renewables surged past coal in 2015 to become world's biggest source of electricity: IEA.""In reading that headline, one might get the impression that wind turbines and solar panels produced more electricity last year than coal. But the fine print actually reveals a very different picture.The opening paragraph of the article by ""Freelance digital reporter"" Anmar Frangoul gives a clue as to the sleight of hand being used. Frangoul cites the International Energy Agency (IEA) as reporting that ""Renewable energy moved past coal in 2015 to become the biggest source of global electricity capacity."" The key word there is ""capacity.""What's noteworthy is that capacity is far different from actual production. The average wind turbine has a maximum rated capacity of roughly 2 megawatts. That means, if the wind is blowing between 26-56 mph, the turbine can spin up to its peak generating capacity. In such moments, the wind turbine can produce its full 2 megawatts.However, wind turbines, like solar panels, offer only intermittent power generation. Wind turbines can only produce power when there is sufficient wind--and when they are not shut down due to cold weather, repairs, or high winds. And solar panels only produce electricity during periods of direct sunlight. Thus, while a wind turbine can have a maximum capacity of 2 megawatts, its typical output may often be far less, or even 0 megawatts (on a windless day).In contrast, and as the IEA itself notes, coal provided 40.8 percent of worldwide power generation in 2014. The renewables that Frangoul crows about--defined by the IEA as ""geothermal, solar, wind, heat, etc.""--produced only 6.3 percent of all power.Thus we see some of the misleading language in the CNBC article.Frangoul talks about renewables producing 23 percent of world power generation in 2015--which is only possible when hydropower's robust 16.4 percent is added to renewables' paltry 6.3 percent share. And while the IEA says that ""renewables represented more than half the new power capacity around the world"" in 2015, one has to remember their frustrating intermittency. Wind turbines only generate roughly 20 percent of their installed capacity, and solar panels yield an even more meager 10 percent.So, while Frangoul is happy to tout all of this new power plant construction, one has to consider that it represents investments that will often sit idle.Such imprudence might seem naive. But the IEA astutely notes that ""renewable power expanded at its fastest-ever rate in 2015, thanks to supportive government policies.""Indeed, it is these very subsidies that have triggered a rush to wind and solar, despite abundant evidence of their limitations. It would be interesting, then, for reporters like Frangoul to further examine these much-touted renewable projects, and see if ""capacity"" actually meets expectations.SIGN UP"

On Monday, O'Keefe and Project Veritas released a video showing Creamer claiming that Hillary Clinton had personally approved one of his stunts, involving an activist dressing up as Donald Duck and trying to provoke Trump supporters.In the new video, Creamer goes even further, saying: ""Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters ... I am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising."" He also mentions a conference call discussing a woman potentially coming forward to accuse Trump of inappropriate behavior.Creamer, a seasoned Chicago activist, also talks about his work with Barack Obama, whom he says he has known since the 1980s, when Obama was a community organizer in Chicago: ""He's a pro, I've known the President since he was a community organizer in Chicago.""Elsewhere, Creamer adds: ""I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the... the health care bill, for trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.""In the new video, O'Keefe also reveals that Project Veritas arranged for a donation of $20,000 to be wired to the Americans for United for Change super PAC from Belize, via a bank account provided by Creamer. He adds that Americans United for Change suddenly returned the donation once the first Project Veritas videos were released last week.Creamer is married to Rep.

This is in that tradition.""He explained:What's really happening here is simple. You've got large financial institutions on Wall Street, you've got banks like Bank of America, who have in some cases committed financial crimes. I think some of them are real, some of them may not be, but set that aside for a minute. The Department of Justice has gone after them and basically said, 'You committed these offenses, you've got to pay restitution in the form of billions of dollars.' Okay, they committed the crime, they ought to pay that.Now, ostensibly that money, those billions of dollars, are supposed to go to the victims of their financial crimes. If your Wall Street broker committed fraud, you're supposed to be made whole with this money, and the rest of it is supposed to go to taxpayers.The problem is the Obama Justice Department has been diverting literally more than $650 million to left-wing groups.

I think some of them are real, some of them may not be, but set that aside for a minute. The Department of Justice has gone after them and basically said, 'You committed these offenses, you've got to pay restitution in the form of billions of dollars.' Okay, they committed the crime, they ought to pay that.
Now, ostensibly that money, those billions of dollars, are supposed to go to the victims of their financial crimes. If your Wall Street broker committed fraud, you're supposed to be made whole with this money, and the rest of it is supposed to go to taxpayers.
The problem is the Obama Justice Department has been diverting literally more than $650 million to left-wing groups.

Swamp	"I have been politically active for 40 years and during this time I have watched as many Republicans made campaign promise after campaign promise as candidates, then once elected they made grand excuses on why they couldn't keep their promises. Case in point, the GOP controlled the White House, Senate, and House from January of 2003 until January of 2007. We were disappointed to find that the Republicans passed no meaningful reforms that conservatives clamored for, but instead were mired in corruption scandals. K Street lobbyists had their hooks into elected Republican Leadership and prevented them from passing meaningful change. This was never more evident then when T.A.R.P, aka ""Wall Street Bailout"", passed with the support of Democrats, President George W. Bush, and some Republicans in Congress. There were many Republicans opposed to TARP and fought it, but Republican Leadership beat the opposition back. Conservatives were infuriated by this and rightly so. That was one of the catalysts for the Tea Party Movement that was founded in February of 2009. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMake no mistake about it, the ruling elite in both the Republican and Democrat parties have been corrupted for decades by deep pocketed special interests like big banks, Wall Street and the military industrial complex. The grassroots in both major political  parties have been overpowered for decades by the big bucks of these special interests. I have witnessed many liberty minded warriors promising to fight the corrupt system be elected to Congress, only to be co-opted by the special interests that troll the halls of the U.S. Capitol after only a few short years. For decades, the big money of special interests have successfully entrenched corruption in our nation's Capitol. There are some Republicans that stand with the conservative grassroots to fight this corrupt system, but they are vastly outnumbered by those more concerned about getting elected than working in the best interests of their constituents. Jack Abramoff once told me something chilling. He said it would be just a matter of time before lobbyists had their hooks into even the best intentioned Congressman and Congresswoman.I often reach across the aisle and work with activists on the left on issues we agree on.

Trump doesn't need the money of K Street and he has proven he doesn't back down. I don't agree with everything Trump has said or done, but one thing is unmistakable, and that is he will fight to drain the swamp in D.C. and make real changes. He is a champion for Main Street voters of both parties sick of the corruption. One only has to look at the way the ruling elite of the Republican party, corrupt main stream media, and special interests are opposing Trump with all their might to show just how much they are fighting to hang on to their corrupt system. Trump going after the corruption has also awakened voters into being politically active that have normally shunned the political process in their lifetimes. Despite my longtime political activism, my 36 year old daughter Ashley has never cared about the political process and has infrequently voted. Trump has changed all that. She is now fully engaged in the political process and it is because of Trump. She even sent me a text yesterday morning apprehensive about whether or not WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was still alive. She is excited to be able to vote for someone that is willing to take on the corrupt system and bring about needed change. I spoke to a friend of hers this past weekend named Justin. Justin told me that he is 40 years old and has never at one time voted because he felt that all politicians were crooks and the process was corrupt. He will cast his first ballot for Donald Trump and has become fully engaged in the political process. He has become obsessed with electing Trump President and has even began to read conservative blogs everyday like Breitbart. I have no doubt that there are millions of others like my daughter and her friend Justin that aren't being polled because they aren't listed as likely voters. I also believe strongly that there will be some on the left, concerned about corruption, that will cast their vote for Donald Trump once they get in the voting booth. I have personally talked to some Democrats that will.

So far, those claims have been made by Donna Brazile, the interim head of the Democratic National Committee, and by Sen. Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's choice for her vice-president.On Tuesday, for example, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday that ""I can't verify the integrity of these emails,"" when he was asked about an email which showed Clinton's staff knew that President Barack Obama was communicating with Clinton via her secret home-made email system. The email contradicts Obama's March 2015 claim that he learned about Clinton's server at ""the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.""But Breitbart News used commercial software and a basic e-mail verification system to confirm that the Clinton staff email -- ""he has emails from her -- they do not say state.gov"" -- is valid, true and unmodified. These Wikileaks emails come from an account used by John Podesta, the chairman of Clinton's presidential campaign. He has suggested some of the emails are faked, and he has also tried to distract journalists from the revelations by complaining about Russian's possible role in the hacking. 3. Don't have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked...-- John Podesta (@johnpodesta) October 7, 2016But each email contains a unique digital key, which is actually a unique number so huge that it is almost impossible to guess, fake, or copy. The key, which is automatically created by the email server at Clinton's organization, is added to each email as it is first sent, so that if the message is later altered, the key will show other email servers that the original message did not come from the claimed server, or that it has been altered.The proper name of the process is ""DomainKeys Identified Mail,"" which is shortened to DKIM.DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) lets an organization take responsibility for a message that is in transit.  The organization is a handler of the message, either as its originator or as an intermediary. Their reputation is the basis for evaluating whether to trust the message for further handling, such as delivery. Technically DKIM provides a method for validating a domain name identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication.The digital keys in the messages fit into a widely used encryption system that is not controlled by Wikileaks or any other group.When security experts test the Wikileaks' email keys against the shared encryption system, they find that the emails are unmodified. The DKIM key is practically impossible to forge, Robert Graham, a principal at Errata Security told Breitbart News. Readers can conduct the DKIM tests themselves. For example, the commercial email program Thunderbird allows a ""DKIM"" add-on, which automatically checks the key in each message against the shared encryption system.Breitbart, for example, tested the email which contains apparent drafts of Hillary Clinton's speeches to Goldman Sachs. The email was sent by Clinton staffer Tony Carrk to Podesta.  The test showed that Carrk's DKIM key was correct, and his message -- which included the speeches -- from Clinton's server was judged ""valid.""Here is another message validation provided by Graham, which bolsters evidence that Brazile leaked a townhall debate question to Clinton during the primaries.Security experts have successfully tested many of the messages via different versions of the DKIM process.Some of the messages failed some DKIM tests but passed also passed other other DKIM tests. Security experts blame the few failures on the process by which Wikileaks's source may have copied and disseminated the emails. But they warn if a message is validated by even one test, then that message is valid and unchanged.""There are lots of reasons"" why a valid message released via Wikileaks might fail a few DKIM tests, said Graham. For example, the Wikileaks process may drop digits from buried code in the message, he said. ""DKIM is super finicky. If someone at wikileaks accidentally hit tab, or spacebar or whatever and then saved it, that's enough for DKIM to fail,"" said another person checking the emails.This post on /r/wikileaks brings up that a number of recently released e-mails failed DKIM verification.I can confirm that the e-mails in this post did fail DKIM verification. (And I thank the user for taking the time to check them and bring it to our attention!) However, there are a number of explanations for this.This e-mail (25226) is one of the ones that fails DKIM verification.Fortunately, this e-mail (600) is later in the same e-mail chain. That means everything in e-mail 25226 is included in e-mail 600.E-mail 600 passes DKIM verification. Therefore, everything in 25226 has been verified by 600.Multiple Democrats are insisting that the emails released by Wikileaks are untrustworthy because they may have been altered.When pressed by Megyn Kelly on Fox to explain an email from her account that shows she revealed a question to be asked at a CNN TV-debate, Brazile evaded. ""I am not going to try and validate falsified information,"" she said. As a Christian woman, I understand persecution ... Your information is totally false ... you're like a thief that wants to bring into the night the things that ... I have seen so many doctored emails. I have seen things that come from me at two in the morning that I don't even send. There are several email addresses that I once used ... This has not been verified ... This is under investigation.
Similarly, Kaine dismissed the Wikileak messages after the site announced via Twitter it will release a surprise related to Kaine.""I don't know whether it was doctored or whether the person sending it didn't know what they were talking about,"" he said Oct. on ""Meet The Press"" Sunday TV show. ""But, clearly, I think there's a capacity for much of the information in them to be wrong.""The Wikileaks site subsequently repeated its claim.@MeetThePress @timkaine We have a surprise for @TimKaine #TKSurprise-- WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 20163.

Mr. Trump, who has lashed out at the speaker for being critical of him, has privately said that Mr. Ryan should pay a price for his disloyalty, according to two people close to Mr. Trump who insisted on anonymity to describe internal campaign discussions.Mr. Trump's campaign chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, the provocative chairman of Breitbart News, made Mr. Ryan a frequent target of its coverage while he ran the website and is said to be particularly intent on forcing Mr. Ryan out. And Mr. Bannon, who declined to be interviewed for this article, would be able to pick up at Breitbart where he left off: as a persistent irritant to the Republican establishment.In interviews, Mr. Trump's supporters said they were determined to harness the anti-establishment energy that Mr. Trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the Republican leadership in Congress -- a target many of them seem just as eager to take down as they are to bring down Mrs. Clinton.

The complainant implied that Flowers was only hired because of her alleged relationship with Clinton.From December 1990 to December 1991, Flowers famously recorded a series of conversations with Clinton during the period he was Governor of Arkansas and considering a run for the presidency.On October 1991, Clinton announced his bid for the Oval Office, with rumors of extramarital affairs threatening to derail his campaign.Flowers recently provided this reporter with complete original cassette recordings of her taped conversations with Clinton, recordings that take on renewed significance as the issue of Clinton's alleged treatment of women has reemerged during the 2016 presidential campaign.The sections of the audio recordings related to the state job are not exclusive to Breitbart News. Those excerpts were played for the news media in 1992, one day after Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared side by side on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied a relationship with Flowers.Clinton later admitted to one sexual encounter with Flowers in a 1998 deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit.The audio segments about the state job were widely reported by the news media in the 1990's. However, the details may warrant revisiting amid numerous Clinton financial scandals that have since surfaced alleging pay-for-play, including those tied to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.In one section of the audio, which can be heard above, Flowers discusses the grievance filed against her and informs Clinton that she was being questioned about how she obtained the position.Clinton says ""Good for you,"" when Flowers tells him that she found out about the job from a newspaper advertisement and pursued it from there.Here is a transcript of that part of the audio:GF - But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It's just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, ""Well, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,"" and then uh, ""they told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there.BC - Good for you.GF - Well, it caught me off guard 'cause I... at first I just didn't know... I just didn't expect that for some reason. I thought about a whole lot of things about my qualifications and all that business, but I didn't think about that.BC - Yeah.In the next section of the audio, Flowers expresses concern that the news media, which was asking her questions about the alleged affair, could find out about the state job.GF: Yeah. We had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an X-ray. And she went and had it checked again and it wasn't cancer. And it's been almost, it'll be two years in May that she's now diagnosed cancer free. My stepfather has been through two angioplasties, but he's doing good. And I am, I'm really, Bill what I'm afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that I'm working for the state.GF - They're going to make a big deal of it.In a subsequent conversation, Clinton specifically counsels Flowers to say ""no"" if she is asked about whether she discussed the state job with him.Here is a transcript:GF - Well the only thing that concerns me, where I'm, where I'm concerned at this point is the state job.BC - Yeah. I never thought about that, but as long as you say you've just been looking for one, you'd uh, check on it. If they ever asked if you'd talked to me about it, you can say no.GF - Well and I would. But I'm... here is the thing I've got to consider, too, is I've gotta go in there to work every day. You know what I mean?BC - Yep.GF - And if, and if these people start talking or someone in the press...BC - Well, have they been nice to you there?GF - Yeah they have been. But I don't, you know, I mean, I just want you to know what's going on. And I'll be glad to hang in there.BC - Has the, has the...GF - But if it gets real...BC - Has the grievance committee ruled yet?GF - No. Not that I am aware of. Uh, I forget the guy's name that appeared to be the head of it. Dudley or Dewey. Is there a Dudley or a Dewy or somebody? Do you know?BC - I don't know.GF - Don Barnes was there. And of course...BC - Is he happy with you?GF - Well sure. (Laughter.) I'm good. I'm good at what I do, Bill.BC - I know.GF - But Don was, you know. He... He pretty much... When this guy was trying to beat up on me a little, said, ""hey, I don't see the relevance of this"" and dadada. And then the head of the grievance committee said ""I don't either and I think we need to go on and you know go, not go along with this line of questioning."" And then that was about it except for just some other minor questions. But I found that curious that he would ask me how I found out about the job.GF - Now maybe at this point I'm paranoid but I mean no one has mentioned anything about it to me at all but I just found that, that I found interesting.In another conversation, Clinton tells Flowers that he will ""nose around"" to see if he can find out more about the issue, and he asked her whether the person who filed the grievance was being represented by a lawyer.BC - Alright. I'm gonna nose around, if I find out anything I'll call you. And meanwhile, uh, I can understand this grievance thing. I'll, I'll run that down.GF - Well I don't think there'll be any problem there from what I understand, you know, that her deal was to either have my job or for them to create a position equal to mine.BC - Uh huh.GF - But it's my understanding that then it'll go to... even if they say yes, created position for her.GF - That's the same as Gennifer's. Don Barnes can always say, ""No, I won't"" and period. That's it.BC - That's right. I mean that's my understanding. So...BC- Yeah. And then she could sue, but I doubt if she will. Was she there with a lawyer or a representative of any kind?GF - She had a guy that works for the tribunal represent her which I thought was very inappropriate.BC - Uh huh. Well, I guess maybe they do that for people...Contacted yesterday by Breitbart News, Flowers explained why she says she turned to Clinton for help securing the state job.She stated:I found out my Mom had cancer and decided I wanted a regular job so I would have my weekends to spend with her. I was performing six nights a week and wouldn't of had time. I asked to get me the job and he did.In her deposition for the Paula Jones case, Flowers detailed Clinton's alleged involvement in helping her secure the state job.Here is her affidavit on that matter:In early 1990 I told Bill Clinton that I wanted a job with the state. Bill Clinton told me to contact his assistant Judy Gaddy who would assist me with the application for employment. I met with Judy Gaddy in her office and she provided me with the details of what needed to be on the application. Judy Gaddy also told me to contact Clara Clark who set up a job interview for me. I was eventually employed by the state as an administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.Shortly after I was employed by the state, another woman who had applied for my job filed a grievance or some sort of complaint in which she alleged that she was more qualified and implied that the only reason I got the job was because I had had an affair with Bill Clinton. I was called to testify before a panel in connection with this proceeding. When I learned that I would have to testify, I did not know what to do, so I called Bill Clinton. I told him that I had been called to testify and asked what I should say. He told me to deny that we had ever had an affair. During the proceeding, when questions came up about my relationship to Bill, Don Barnes, his appointee and head of the commission, stopped the questioning.In 1992, Michael Isikoff reported at the Washington Post that Clinton's office admitted that it helped Flowers obtain the job in June 1991, while denying allegations that Flowers was Clinton's mistress. Clinton's office maintained that Clinton only helped Flowers because the politician felt bad that she was being hounded by the media over the sex allegations.Isikoff reported:Gov. Bill Clinton's office said today that Clinton assigned a member of his staff to help Gennifer Flowers find a state job in September 1990 after she asked for his assistance.Michael Gauldin, Clinton's press secretary, also released two handwritten notes he said Flowers had written to Clinton. The first, in 1986, said she would appreciate his help in finding a job. The second, dated Feb. 23, 1991, complained that the assistant assigned to help her was not being very ""successful."" ...Gauldin said Clinton was interested in helping her in part because he ""felt responsible for all the women"" who were being hounded by reporters after they were named in an unsuccessful 1990 lawsuit in which a state employee alleged the governor had used state funds in furtherance of extramarital affairs.In the 1986 letter, Flowers enclosed a resume, said she ""certainly enjoyed speaking with you by phone,"" and said ""anything you can do"" to help with employment would be ""appreciated.""In the 1991 ""Dear Bill"" letter, Flowers complained that the staff aide Clinton assigned to the matter, special assistant Judy S. Caddy, ""has not been very successful in the job hunting area.""""Bill, I've tried to explain my financial situation to you and how badly I need a job,"" Flowers wrote. She said she was enclosing ""some correspondence that will be of interest to you"" - a letter written by a lawyer she had hired threatening to sue a local radio station for repeating the 1990 allegations. The letter, which had previously been released by Clinton, said the allegations were untrue.""Unfortunately, it looks like I will have to pursue the law suit to hopefully, get some money to live on until I can get employment,"" Flowers ended the note. ""Please be in touch.""In 1998, the Washington Post again reported on the matter:Flowers said her affair with Clinton had been over for at least a year but that about the time of the Nichols suit, she was looking for a job and turned to the governor.Clinton agreed to help find her a position at an Arkansas state agency, Flowers said, and enlisted a political appointee named Don Barnes. Efforts to contact Barnes last night were unsuccessful.""I don't know Vernon Jordan, and I don't know whether he is or is not telling the truth,"" Flowers said. ""But it reminds me of [1990] in regard to a position that Vernon Jordan supposedly arranged for Monica Lewinsky.""Flowers was hired by the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal, a state agency, after an interview Barnes arranged and sat in on, according to Flowers' 1995 written account of her relationship with Clinton.Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

18	http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/10/26/judge-approves-nearly-15-billion-volkswagen-emissions-settlement/	Judge Approves Nearly $15 Billion Volkswagen Emissions Settlement	"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal judge approved the largest auto-scandal settlement in U.S. history Tuesday, giving nearly a half-million Volkswagen owners and leaseholders the choice between selling their cars back or having them repaired so they don't cheat on emissions tests and spew excess pollution.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERU.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the nearly $15 billion deal ""adequately and fairly"" compensates consumers and gets the polluting vehicles off the road as soon as possible.The German automaker acknowledged last year that about 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-liter, four-cylinder diesel engines were programmed to cheat on emissions tests.Under the agreement, owners can choose to have Volkswagen buy back their vehicle regardless of its condition for the full trade-in price on Sept. 18, 2015, when the scandal broke, or pay for repairs. Either way, Volkswagen also will pay owners $5,100 to $10,000, depending on the age of the car and whether the owner had it prior to Sept. 18 of last year.Volkswagen has agreed to spend up to $10 billion compensating consumers and could start buying back the cars as early as next month. Regulators have not approved any fixes.The settlement also includes $2.7 billion for unspecified environmental mitigation and $2 billion to promote zero-emissions vehicles.""We're going to sell it back as soon as humanly possible and try to put this behind us,"" said Joe Azam, a 35-year-old attorney in New York who owns a 2014 Jetta wagon.Still, Azam said he thought Volkswagen ""got off easy"" in how much it was paying vehicle owners.Blair Stewart, a 2012 Jetta wagon owner in Palo Alto, California, said Volkswagen should have paid owners the full purchase price of their vehicle, given the company's fraud.""This is not enough to deter the kind of behavior they did,"" he said.Breyer concluded that affected car owners were not entitled to a full refund because many had ""received a great deal of use out of their vehicles."" He also raised the specter of bankruptcy for Volkswagen if it had to pay the full purchase price.The scandal has damaged Volkswagen's reputation and hurt its sales. The company is still facing potentially billions more in fines and penalties and possible criminal charges. It also will pay up to $332.5 million in attorney fees and costs and up to $1.2 billion to its U.S. dealers.The settlement's approval ""is an important milestone in our journey to making things right in the United States,"" Hinrich J. Woebcken, president and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America Inc. said in a statement. ""Volkswagen is committed to ensuring that the program is now carried out as seamlessly as possible for our affected customers and has devoted significant resources and personnel to making their experience a positive one.""The lead attorney for car owners, Elizabeth Cabraser, said in a statement that the deal ""holds Volkswagen accountable for its illegal behavior and breach of consumer trust."" More than 330,000 people have signed up for settlement benefits, with about 3,200 opting out, she told the judge last week.Peggy Schaeffer, a North Carolina librarian with a diesel 2010 Jetta wagon, said she was pleased with the settlement terms and has submitted her buyback paperwork. She expects to get close to $15,000 for a car she bought for $16,000 in 2010.""It's hard to be grumpy about that,"" she said.The company said in April that it has set aside $18.2 billion to cover the cost of the global scandal, which erupted last year when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Volkswagen had fitted many of its cars with software to fool emissions tests. Car owners and the U.S. Department of Justice sued.The software recognized when the cars were being tested on a treadmill and turned on pollution controls. The controls were turned off when the cars returned to the road. The EPA alleged the scheme let the cars spew up to 40 times the allowable limit of nitrogen oxide, which can cause respiratory problems in humans.Through September, VW Group's sales in the U.S. are down nearly 7 percent from 2015 figures, to just under 386,000 vehicles. The Volkswagen brand fared worse, with sales down 12.5 percent, to just over 231,000 vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. The VW Group includes the Audi, VW, Bentley and Lamborghini brands.The settlement releases legal claims from most of the 2-liter engine owners, but it doesn't affect larger 3-liter, six-cylinder diesels, which also cheated on tests. It also doesn't end claims against parts supplier Robert Bosch, which drew up the cheating software.SIGN UP"

The rest will be shielded from most or all of those price increases by ObamaCare subsidies, which increase alongside the rising premiums....In a call with reporters on Monday, officials with the Obama administration stressed that the new numbers don't reflect what most people will end up paying.""We think [consumers] will ultimately be surprised by the affordability of the product,"" said Kevin Griffis, assistant secretary for public affairs for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).Since Obamacare has essentially made more Americans eligible for Medicaid, most who have signed up for the healthcare program through the federal website healthcare.gov will not see the steep hikes because other Americans will be paying for them. That's what a ""subsidy"" is - someone gets something ""for free"" because the government forces other people to pay for it.Nevertheless, those on Obamacare who receive subsidies will still have to deal with the very limited - and, in some cases, practically non-existent - choices in insurance plans. Those customers with subsidies who have chronic medical conditions may not see an actual out-of-pocket cost hike, but they will likely find they are forced to switch plans - and doctors - because some of the major national insurance companies have left the program.""Enrollees may need to change doctors or drugs when they switch insurers,"" said Caroline Pearson of the consulting firm Avalere Health.The upshot is even those whose health insurance is mostly paid for by other Americans won't be able to keep their doctor, if they like their doctor.Chris Jacobs writes at National Review:Even as it stands now...the exchanges are little more than Medicaid-like ghettoes, attracting a largely low-income population most worried about their monthly costs. To moderate premium spikes, insurers have done what Medicaid managed-care plans do: Narrow networks. Consultants at McKinsey note that three-quarters of exchange plans in 2017 will have no out-of-network coverage, except in emergency cases. And those provider networks themselves are incredibly narrow: one-third fewer specialists than the average employer plan, and hospital networks continuing to shrink.Obama and Hillary Clinton are betting on low-income Americans' satisfaction with subsidies ""shielding"" them from increased costs, while their actual access to care is compromised.The premium hikes will directly hit the 16 percent of people with ObamaCare plans who do not currently receive subsidies. The rest will be shielded from most or all of those price increases by ObamaCare subsidies, which increase alongside the rising premiums.

In September 2016, however, three Syrian refugees were resettled in Reno by the Northern Nevada International Center  the local affiliate of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, one of the nine politically powerful voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) who are paid more than $1 billion per year by the federal government to operate the refugee resettlement program.During the first 25 days of FY 2017, 17 Syrian refugees have been resettled in Reno by the Northern Nevada International Center, 6 have been resettled in Las Vegas by Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada.The Office of Refugee Resettlement and the State Department recently indicated it will be expanding the resettlement of refugees to smaller communities around the country.Last November, Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve said ""she never let her formal support for the application by the Northern Nevada International Center to begin the [Syrian] refugee resettlement program [in Reno],"" the Reno Gazette-Journal reported:Reno could begin accepting Syrian, Iraqi, Cuban and other refugees who have undergone extensive federal screening as early as next summer if a local non-profit organization's application to become a resettlement agency is approved.
The center's application, which coincidentally was sent just hours before news of the unfolding terrorist attacks in Paris reached the United States, claims support from Schieve and the Reno city manager's office.The center's application to become an ""affiliate refugee resettlement agency of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants"" was first reported by Reno Gazette-Journal columnist Jon Ralston.Schieve said several months ago she had reached out to the center to learn more about how Reno might become part of the humanitarian effort to relocate more than 20,000 Syrian refugees who have been referred to the United States for resettlement consideration. No more than 10,000 could actually be resettled through the U.S. State Department and its partner agencies.But when it came time for the center to file the application, Schieve had yet to ask the full Reno City Council to approve a resolution of support--a resolution Schieve said would be necessary for the city to formally back the effort.""The one thing we are in support of are any humanitarian efforts,"" Schieve said. ""At the same time, we don't condone anything to do with terrorists, of course. We have to take pause to make sure this vetting process is exactly what the federal government needs it to be, especially in light of the Paris attack.""Under the Refugee Act of 1980, the federal government and the director of Office of Refugee Resettlement are required to consult with state and local officials prior to the resettlement of refugees within their jurisdiction.The federal government, however, has for the most part, failed to comply with the ""consultation clause"" of the Refugee Act of 1980, and several states, including Texas, Alabama, and Tennessee, are suing the federal government for that violation of the law. Tennessee, which has withdrawn from the federal refugee resettlement program, is also suing on Tenth Amendment grounds.Though no local government has yet filed a similar lawsuit, L. Brooks Patterson, County Executive for Oakland County, Michigan, said last month he intends to sue the federal government for its failure to comply with the Refugee Act of 1980's ""consultation clause,"" and the trustees of Waterford Township in Michigan recently unanimously passed a resolution stating the township would not cooperate with the refugee resettlement program.The number of refugees resettled in Nevada has increased steadily each year since 2011. If the current pace of the first 25 days of October continues for the balance of FY 2017, about five times as many refugees would be resettled in the state in FY 2017 (1,528) as were resettled in FY 2011 (325).Nevada withdrew from the federal refugee resettlement program in 1994. Since that time, the federal refugee resettlement program has been operated under the statutorily questionable Wilson Fish alternative program, when the federal government selected Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada to be the resettlement agency to manage the program in the state on its behalf.On its website, Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada says:On average, we welcome 2,200 refugees per year into Las Vegas. Migration and Refugee Services (MRS) helps refugees from all over the world rebuild their lives after they have been forced to leave their families, homes, and countries behind because of racial, religious, or political persecution, often fleeing for their life. Our goal is to help refugees become self-sufficient and lead independent lives as quickly as possible.The number cited at the website, 2,200 refugees per year, is actually a combination of several different legal categories of federally assisted immigrants, which the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement refers to as ""all served populations"": (1) refugees who are purportedly fleeing war or instability in their home country (2) parolees from countries like Cuba, which are in a special category (3) asylees,  (4) certified Victims of Trafficking, and (5) Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders from Iraq and Afghanistan.""Catholic Charities serves as both the State Refugee Coordinator (SRC), and a local resettlement agency but it wasn't until FY 2011, that they separated these roles by creating two distinct departments within Catholic Charities.  Catholic Charities, Nevada Office for Refugees (CCSN/NOR)  now serves as the designated State Refugee Coordinator's office for Nevada,"" an attorney familiar with the refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News.Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, in a letter to President Obama in November, expressed concern over Syrian refugees that were being resettled in the state.""I am specifically concerned about the background checks performed for Syrian refugees sent to Nevada for resettlement, and would appreciate further guidance on the benefits eligibility of such persons while they reside here,"" Sandoval said.The Washington Post reported that Sandoval was ""taking the middle ground"" approach to the arrival of Syrian refugees, implying a willingness to concede to the federal government once he is satisfied with the vetting.Sandoval's letter to President Obama appears to have had little impact on the subsequent resettlement of Syrian refugees in Nevada.Reno could begin accepting Syrian, Iraqi, Cuban and other refugees who have undergone extensive federal screening as early as next summer if a local non-profit organization's application to become a resettlement agency is approved.

In an October 24 interview with the Washington Examiner, Mackowiak stated that Fox News' Sean Hannity should only have paid consultants on his nationally syndicated radio show.""We need to get to a point where Hannity only has paid contributors on. He doesn't need to have elected officials on,"" Mackowiak told the Examiner.He went on to ask readers to fight back against advertisers on conservative news sites, naming Breitbart specifically.""Someone needs to be making sure that if you want to go open $50,000 [in ads] on Breitbart, that there is, that you get a phone call that follows that up and makes clear you're not helping.""Noting his inability to deliver his message of frustration, Mackowiak continued, saying that as long as conservative luminaries ""have an audience, there's a limit to what you can do.""This is not Mackowiak's first outrageous comment or attack on conservatives. As recently as last week, Mackowiak tweeted a message questioning the credentials of Donald Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson saying, ""She's slept her way to the middle Zero moral or ethical character @KatrinaPierson.""She's slept her way to the middle
Zero moral or ethical character @KatrinaPierson https://t.co/go7d3MhsKe-- Matt Mackowiak (@MattMackowiak) October 19, 2016In what appears to be an effort to increase his television bookings, his attack on the character of a conservative black Republican woman came on the same day he was appearing on MSNBC for coverage of the last presidential debate in Las Vegas.Pierson is not the only Republican woman to draw character assassination fire from Mackowiak's tweets. On August 31, Mackowiak put conservative author Ann Coulter in his crosshairs tweeting, ""Cocaine is a powerful drug,"" in response to Coulter's tweet about a Trump speech where he compared the GOP candidate to Winston Churchill. ""I hear Churchill had a nice turn of phrase, but Trump's immigration speech is the most magnificent speech ever given,"" she wrote.

Mackowiak's history of attacking women goes back further. In September 2014, he called cases of sexual violence against women, rape and incest, ""minor issues"" and said they do not deserve attention in the abortion debate because ""Texas is a strong pro-life state,"" the Burnt Orange Report stated. He went on to call then-gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis' revelation about her own abortion ""subhuman instinct,"" the article states.The comments became fodder for the Davis gubernatorial campaign. In response, Mackowiak tried to minimize the impact of his outburst claiming in an email to Politifact that he was not saying rape and incest are minor issues. ""Rather, I said that rape and incest are a small percentage of abortions,"" he told the fact-checking organization. The campaign for Greg Abbott quickly distanced itself from Mackowiak's remarks. Spokesperson Amelia Chasse told Politifact via email that ""Mackowiak hasn't been employed or paid by Abbott's campaign.""Mackowiak has his own truth meter page on Politifact. The organization listed 75 percent of his statements they had checked as either ""Mostly False"" or ""False.""In response to Mackowiak's interview calling for the targeting of advertisers on conservative media, one Twitter user, @MorganWarstler stated, ""@HeyTammyBruce finally @MattMackowiak what's DISGUSTING is you don't get GOP base DRIVES Drudge, Hannity, Rush, Trump.""

The self-proclaimed consultant has managed to become a model archetype for an otherwise manufactured ""War on Women"" narrative when he is not debasing himself with low brow NeverTrump rhetoric. For his good deeds, Mackowiak continues to be rewarded with weekly features in POLITICO tipsheets and token MSNBC panel positions. Without those activities, one wonders what else occupies the Republican's time, given that his company website does not appear to have been updated since 2012 and his official Facebook page has been dedicated to selling his personal home to all 97 of its fans.Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
