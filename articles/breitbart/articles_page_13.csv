SMU told her and her mother ""that the demonstration could be deemed insensitive.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe University sent the communication to back out saying they were doing so because the volleyball program ""feels that in light of recent events and diversity within the SMU community,"" ""the demonstration could be deemed insensitive.""The honorary serve to honor her father, slain officer Sgt. Michael Smith, was to occur on Saturday, November 12.The subject line in the email from SMU read simply, ""Smith Family.""Facebook PhotosAs reported by Breitbart Texas in a live coverage all night July 7 and during the early morning of July 8, five police officers were killed, and five more wounded after former Houston New Black Panther member and Nation of Islam sympathizer, Micah Xavier Johnson ambushed the officers as a Black Lives Matter protest was concluding. A mother of four was also wounded.Shetamia Taylor said of the officers that helped protect her and her son, ""They were really heroes for us,"" reported Breitbart Texas. She held a press conference at the hospital where she was treated and broke down sobbing. She said, ""I am celebrating my kids being alive and I am listening to them, telling each other how an officer didn't make it."" That officer helped protect her, and other officers covered her and her son with their bodies to protect them. Officers also put her and her son in the back of a police car to take her to the hospital. The patrol car ""was riddled with bullets"" and was on its rims, Taylor said.Johnson was killed by a robot that carried a bomb to where he was hiding. The Dallas police were the first in the nation to kill a suspect with a robot, as reported by Breitbart News. A search of his home afterwards revealed that Johnson had, in the words of Dallas Police Chief David Brown, enough explosives in his home to ""have devastating effects throughout our city.""Heidi Bradley Smith, the wife of Sgt. Smith, and the mother of the young teenage girl who was scheduled to do the honorary serve in her father's memory, posted this message from the University on her Facebook page.Mrs. Smith's Facebook post, written on Thursday, November 10th at 7:44 p.m., has as of the time of publication of this article, received approximately 1,000 responses, and 1,860 shares.Dallas Police Association President Frederick Frazier was reported to say, ""I don't know who made the decision. I don't really care who made the decision at SMU. But the president at SMU needs to come out himself and call that little girl and tell her that this was a mistake and it was his fault and this will never happen again.""After negative publicity hit the university, SMU has now apologized and re-extended the invitation to have the honorary serve in Sgt. Michael Smith's memory.Fox 4 reported that the university issued the following statement in part, ""This incident does not reflect SMU values. Due to a change in staffing, there was a breakdown in communication that led to this unfortunate situation. The invitation was intended to help a family heal, and we very much look forward to Victoria's first serve in the volleyball match Saturday.""As you can see from Mrs. Smith's Facebook post, the University, in addition to saying that ""the demonstration could be deemed insensitive,"" also claimed in the original email that ""The volleyball program was not correctly informed that this would be taking place at the game.""Mrs. Smith said she and her daughter would not be attending. The widow of the slain officer said, ""Victoria feels like the disrespect is already there. And I think at her age, being 14, that's just too much for her to deal with,"" Fox 4 reported.Mrs. Smith added, ""To me, that was a cowardly way of saying the results of this election. I really feel like the decision was made out of fear of what evil might come of it instead of the good that could have come out of it.""Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

On Friday, Breitbart Texas reported a 37 percent increase in FMUA apprehensions in October. That same month saw a 19 percent increase in UAC apprehensions. Total border apprehensions increased by 17 percent along the southwestern border between Mexico and the U.S. These statistics were reported by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh Johnson Thursday evening.In response to the surge, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials announced the temporary deployment an additional 150 Border Patrol agents to the Rio Grande Valley Sector in South Texas.""Illicit networks facilitate the majority of cross-border activity and smugglers prey on migrants by extorting money, confining them in deplorable conditions, and often physically and sexually assaulting them,"" Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Marlene Castro wrote in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas Saturday morning. ""Despite these risks, migrants continue to entrust their lives each day to these unscrupulous criminals.""The agents will temporarily be transferred from the Tucson, San Diego, and Del Rio Sectors to the McAllen and Weslaco Centralized Processing Centers. Their duty will be to increase the screening and processing of the unauthorized immigrants with a focus on UACs and FMUAs, she stated.Earlier this month, Breitbart Texas reported that cartel smugglers were using the U.S. elections as a ""marketing tool"" to bring more illegal immigrants to the U.S. border. That marketing ploy was apparently successful.During the month of October, the apprehensions of FMUAs increased by nearly 37 percent over September, according to information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials by Breitbart Texas. Those numbers have been increasing nearly every month leading up to the election since January. October also saw an increase in the apprehensions of UACs by nearly 19 percent. Those numbers also were increasing nearly every month during 2016. Total apprehensions of all illegal aliens crossing the border in October rose by nearly 17 percent.""In October a total of 46,195 individuals were apprehended between ports of entry on our southwest border, compared with 39,501 in September and 37,048 in August,"" Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. ""Within these totals, we have seen corresponding increases in the numbers of unaccompanied children and individuals in families apprehended. We've also seen increases in the numbers of those who present themselves at ports of entry along the southwest border seeking asylum.""Johnson said the flood of immigrants has increased the population in detention facilities to about 41,000. This represents an increase of 7,000 to 10,000 people over normal average detentions. ""I have authorized Immigration and Customs Enforcement to acquire additional detention space for single adults so that those apprehended at the border can be returned to their home countries as soon as possible,"" the DHS secretary stated.""The smugglers learned in 2014 that they could tie up Border Patrol agents as babysitters and keep us from our primary mission of stopping illegal border crossings and drug smuggling,"" U.S. Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera told Breitbart Texas in his capacity as president of National Border Patrol Council Local 3307 in an interview on October 26. ""When are we going to get back on the border?""Total apprehensions of all illegal immigrants who crossed the borders outside of designated ports of entry were 46,195. This represents a nearly 17 percent increase over September. Those numbers had also been increasing nearly every month (with the exception of the summer months of June and July). Of the total number in October, nearly half (49 percent) were apprehended in the RGV Sector and 35,210 were apprehended in the six Texas sectors.Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The Parties and the Pendulum2. The Presidency and the PendulumSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFor the Democrats, the news is bad--and it's about to get worse.  Why?  Because the ideological pendulum is swinging the Democrats to a far-left place, and a political party doesn't win from the wings.To be sure, no ideological swing is permanent, but for the next four years, it seems likely that the Democrats will push themselves leftward, to un-electability at the presidential level.I'll get to this pendulum-swinging in a moment, but first, let's establish the current partisan baseline: In addition to Donald Trump winning the White House, the House Republicans will have 238 seats in the next Congress, and Senate Republicans will have 51.  Meanwhile, out in the states, the GOP will control 33 governorships and 67 legislative chambers.To further illustrate the hole that the Democrats find themselves in, here's a chart from The Washington Post, which shows that in the last eight years, Democrats have lost 10.2 percent of their Senate seats, 19.3 percent of their House seats, 20.3 percent of their legislatures, and 35.7 percent of their governorships.  We can add: These are the lowest Democratic numbers since 1928.In the caustic words of Post reporter Philip Bump, ""That whistling sound you hear is the party Thelma-and-Louise-ing.""  Movie fans will recognize that as a reference to the ending scene in the 1991 movie Thelma and Louise, in which the title characters drive off a cliff, plunging to their death.So what happened?  It seemed like only yesterday that the MSM, and the chattering classes overall, were certain that Hillary Clinton was destined for a decisive victory, possibly even a landslide.  Yet now, not so much.So today, the Democrats have something they didn't particularly wish for: the opportunity for an ""agonizing reassessment.""  The problem is that such reassessments don't always end up improving the situation--sometimes they make things worse.As former CNN pundit Bill Schneider liked to say, an election defeat gives the losing party a chance to ""fix"" whatever went wrong.  The big question, of course, is, ""What needs fixing?""  And now the post-mortem ""autopsy"" reports as to the needed fix are coming, one might say, fast and furious.To be sure, a few Hillary loyalists declare that their woman lost because of ""sexism,"" or some other retrograde ""-ism.""  Many more Clintonites blame FBI Director James Comey; shadowy Clinton operative Sidney Blumenthal has gone so far as to claim that the election was a ""coup d'etat"" staged by ""a cabal of right-wing agents of the FBI in the New York office attached to Rudy Giuliani.""  Okay, so that's the thinking of a few Clintonite dead-enders.Meanwhile, most Democrats, and their barely-undercover allies in the MSM, are coming around to the view that Hillary was a deeply flawed candidate.  Here, for example, is the analysis of Politico's Glenn Thrush, writing that the failure of Clinton's campaign was:...proof that a conventional candidate can do practically everything by the numbers (win debates, raise the most cash, assemble the greatest data and voter outreach effort in history) and still fall to a movement impelled by raw emotion, not calculation.We might pause to say that other observers would dispute Thrush's assertion that Clinton won all the presidential debates; it surely seemed that Trump punched through, for example, with, ""You'd be in jail,"" thereby highlighting Clinton's home-brew e-mail scandal.Yet we could also add that a significant advantage that Clinton had going for her was the active collusion of the MSM, including, yes, the very same Glenn Thrush.So now, with the benefit of hindsight, all the defects of Clinton, and the Democrats, and associated ""experts,"" have been made manifest.  Writing the day after the election, Politico's Michael Grunwald observed:The experts, it turned out, had no idea what they were talking about.  And that, it seems, was what last night's Trumpquake was about, a revolt against the experts, against the elites, against the out-of-touch inside-the-Beltway insiders.Again, it's funny how, after the fact, everyone can see the handwriting on the wall.Meanwhile, across the country, Democratic activists, who lean well to the left, are conducting their own ""reassessment,"" and that's sure to affect inside-the-beltway thinking, as well as future party personnel.A post-election poll, for example, commissioned by a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders, concluded that the Vermont socialist would have defeated Trump by an ""historic margin."" Others might question the plausibility of the poll--after all, it's the ultimate instance of an unprovable hypothetical--and yet at the same time, it's obvious that Democratic activists are eager to believe it.  Even today, just days after Clinton's defeat, the Sanders people are already gearing up to take control of the state parties.Also in the wake of the election, a tide of street protest is roiling the country, and that anger is contagious, at least to the left.  Here're the words of one young protestor in San Francisco:As a white, queer person, we need unity with people of color, we need to stand up.  I'm fighting for my rights as an LGBTQ person. I'm fighting for the rights of brown people, black people, Muslim people.A Republican can dismiss such sentiments as just the ranting of a loony lefty.  And yet a Democrat can't, because such voices are numerous, perhaps even predominant, at the Democratic grassroots. Moreover, the institutional Democrats in D.C., frozen out of power in the capital as they are, now lack any sort of political bulwark from which to repel the activist onslaught.Indeed, the new trend of radical thinking has already bled into D.C.  We can see this from a November 10 news item in The Huffington Post: It seems that a Green activist working at the Democratic National Committee stood up in a DNC meeting and heckled Donna Brazile, the outgoing DNC chair.  As the young man, identified only as ""Zach,"" said to Brazile, ""You are part of the problem,"" referring to Brazile's early support for Clinton over Sanders.  And then Zach added this nutty oratorical fusillade:You and your friends will die of old age and I'm going to die from climate change.  You and your friends let this happen, which is going to cut 40 years off my life expectancy.Whereupon Zach stalked out of the room.  Now that crazed bit of speechifying performance-art might strike most Americans as insane, but this is the mindset of Democratic activists these days: Losing has a way of running some people off the rails (assuming they were ever on them).And so now we see the ideological predicate for that big pendulum swing looming dead-ahead in the Democrats' future: Democratic activists, enraged by what's happened in the last week, and blaming the establishment, are determined to ""fix"" the party's problem, even if, in their shortsightedness, such ""fixing"" actually makes the problem worse.Thus we come to Rep. Keith Ellison, the left-wing African-American Muslim Congressman from Minnesota.  A Friday headline in Politico tells us what's likely in Ellison's future: ""Warren: Ellison would make a 'terrific' DNC chair.""  That would be, of course, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's endorsing Ellison to be the next leader of the Democratic National Committee, succeeding Brazile.Indeed, later that same day, Sen. Bernie Sanders--whom most Democratic activists see as the Great Victim of 2016, as he was so obviously robbed by the Hillary-controlled DNC--endorsed Ellison.  Also endorsing was Sen. Chuck Schumer, the incoming leader of the Senate Democrats.  So as we can see, looking toward the DNC election in January, Ellison has genuine momentum.So who is Keith Ellison?  For one thing, he's the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus; indeed, he has a vote-rating of zero (on a zero to 100 scale) from the American Conservative Union.Under the headline, ""Democrats Embrace Their Radicalism,"" Commentary's Noah Rothman delves into him further:Ellison, a former disciple of Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, has compared the 9/11 attacks to the Reichstag fire, implying that its effects--the empowering of the Bush administration to prosecute the Global War on Terror--was the attack's design.And so the rest of us might ask: How could the Democrats want this radical man as their partisan spokesperson--especially in 2017, when so few other Democrats will have the national stage?  In what electoral universe is Ellison an asset?  Surely Ellison's brand of out-there politics isn't helpful to Democratic fortunes in the whole of Minnesota, to say nothing of the whole United States.And yet the Democrats want him, because they're in a radical mood.Of course, not all Democrats are fiery radicals.  And they can't be happy about the Ellison-ization of their party.  Yet at the same time, when a wave is crashing, it's often safer meekly to seek shelter, as opposed to standing up and confronting it at high noon.  So moderate Democrats are likely to remain well hidden during the DNC contest.In addition, it must be said that relatively few Americans, now or in the future, will ever be able to name the DNC Chair.  So in that sense, perhaps moderate Democrats are safe as they quietly seek re-election in 2018, even as their party's ideological hothouse gets hotter.Yet beyond next year's DNC race, there's a deeper dynamic at work.  That is, the choices that the Democrats make in 2017 will almost certainly be an early indicator of where they are headed in 2020.To explore this further, we can go back to Bill Schneider's point about a party's ""fixing"" what went wrong.  That is, the Democrats' collective understanding of why they lost in '16 will guide them as they seek to win in '20.  We can further observe: If the Democrats diagnose their problem correctly, they are perhaps more likely to win in four years.  But if they don't get it right, then they are more likely to be disappointed once again.This is the lesson of political pendulum-swings: Parties need strong situational awareness if they are to have a chance to win, and yet in the tumult of blame-assigning and vengeance-taking, clarity of thought is oftentimes lost.  This dynamic, we can further say, applies to both parties--although today, it's the Democrats' turn to swing.We can offer a thesis statement about this pendulum-swing phenomenon:After a party loses the White House, the old guard--the insider establishment--is, by definition, discredited in the eyes of party activists.  After all, they lost!  And at the same time, it's hard for the activists to admit that something might be wrong with themselves and their beliefs.  Instead, activists typically scapegoat the losing candidate, and the campaign team, for the defeat.  And so power in the party reverts to the ideological base, as activists, having absolved themselves of any fault, proceed with full confidence that they are absolutely in the right.  Thus they nominate, for the next presidential election, a candidate molded in their own image--a candidate of the base.  And base candidates almost never win.  In other words, there's a reason most incumbent presidents win a second term--they draw a weak challenger. Now, to be more party-specific, we can say that for Democrats, this revert-to-the-base phenomenon entails nominating a true-believing liberal--or, as left-wing Democrats prefer to call themselves these days, a ""progressive.""  And by the same token, for the Republicans, base-reversion means nominating a true-believing conservative.  And yet true believers on either side of the aisle, God bless 'em, usually have a hard time getting to 51 percent.We can recall how this pendulum-swing plays out in political history.  In 1960, for instance, Richard Nixon, the incumbent vice president, was defeated by John F. Kennedy.  Nixon's defeat--even in a close election that might, in fact, have been stolen--was a discrediting not only of Nixon, but also of the entire Eisenhower-era Republican establishment.  And so party activists, instinctively and ideologically anti-establishment, gathered around the iconic Sen. Barry Goldwater as they looked ahead to the next election in 1964.The problem for Republicans, of course, was that Goldwater, ideologically ""pure"" as he might have been, was seen as too extreme by the country as a whole.  And so whereas Nixon the establishmentarian lost narrowly in '60, Goldwater the anti-establishmentarian lost in a landslide in '64.We can quickly observe: In this election year, the country was looking for an outsider, and yet sometimes, as in '64, the country is looking for an insider.  The challenge for any candidate is to read correctly the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age.  This year, as we know, Trump read it right, and half-a-century ago, Goldwater read it wrong.Interestingly, after Goldwater's defeat, it was the conservative activists' turn to be discredited, allowing the GOP establishment to make a comeback in the following four years.  Indeed, in 1968 the Republicans nominated... Richard Nixon.  Yes, Nixon, a pillar of the GOP, was the party's choice a second time around.  And, in fact, Nixon won the November election.  Thus we can see the pendulum had swung again, this time in the opposite direction, back to the establishment.Yet of course, our purpose here is not to dope out a possible scenario for the next eight years, but rather, only for the next four years--in particular, what will the Democrats be up to between now and 2020?  And what sort of figure will they choose as their standard-bearer? And so to further illustrate the pendulum-swing phenomenon and where it leads, we can look back to history yet again, this time to the Democrats.The losing Democrat in 1968, Hubert Humphrey, had, like Nixon in 1960, been the incumbent vice president.  In other words, Humphrey was in the bosom of the establishment--at least he was, until he lost.And in fact, Humphrey was interested in running again in 1972.  And yet the Democratic activists--having pushed the establishment aside in an operation mirroring the rise of Republican activists after 1960--weren't interested in Humphrey.  Not in the least.Instead, Dem activists had their hearts set on Sen. George McGovern, who was a bit of a Democratic Barry Goldwater.  That is, McGovern sang sweet music to the party base in the primaries, and so he won the '72 nomination, and yet he was far too ideologically extreme to win the general election.We can observe that this pattern is consistent across the decades, in both parties.  Again: After the ""in"" party loses, the ideological activists take over and nominate one of their own--and that ideological candidate loses even bigger than had the establishment candidate.Thus we can see why so many presidents--most recently, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama--have been two-termers.  That is, in his re-election campaign, the incumbent president is challenged by a base candidate who is simply too extreme to win.Here at this point some might object that the GOP candidate in 2012, Mitt Romney, was no conservative.  And that's true--but he pretended to be one.  That is, Romney attempted to embrace, as he said so awkwardly, ""severely conservative"" positions that a) were not popular with middle-of-the road voters, and b) everyone knew he didn't really mean, anyway.  So no wonder Romney lost badly, and has not been missed since.By contrast, in 2016, while Trump was no establishmentarian, he also didn't pretend to be an orthodox conservative.  Instead, having rejected libertarian Republican dogma on such key issues as immigration and trade, he came across as pragmatic and centrist, even as he retained his populist edge.  And that's why he carried states that hadn't voted Republican since the 1980s.So now we can look ahead, with more clarity, at 2020.  As we have seen, the Democrats are moving left, and they're likely to take their next presidential nominee along with them.  Indeed, all the guiding stars in their firmament--the PC protestors, some of them violent, the growing energy around lefty champions such as Sanders and Warren, the likely election of Keith Ellison to the DNC--are aligning to produce a far left-wing Democratic nominee in four years.And that, of course, is great news for President Trump if he seeks re-election....proof that a conventional candidate can do practically everything by the numbers (win debates, raise the most cash, assemble the greatest data and voter outreach effort in history) and still fall to a movement impelled by raw emotion, not calculation.The experts, it turned out, had no idea what they were talking about.  And that, it seems, was what last night's Trumpquake was about, a revolt against the experts, against the elites, against the out-of-touch inside-the-Beltway insiders.As a white, queer person, we need unity with people of color, we need to stand up.

""If you listened to us in the closing days of this campaign, whether it was crisscrossing America or crisscrossing Wisconsin, we were making an appeal to our fellow citizens and to all Republicans to come home to unify.""However, Ryan's fawning regard for the president-elect on Wednesday seems markedly different from the Republican Speaker's tone just one day prior to Tuesday's election.On Monday, Ryan joined strident #NeverTrump-er Wisconsin talk radio host Charlie Sykes to discuss the next day's election.""Although Donald Trump won the nomination 'fair and square,' the GOP is not his party, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Monday on a local radio show,"" The Hill reported in a piece titled, ""Ryan: GOP Not Donald Trump's Party.""""It is no one person's party.

And he won this fair and square,"" Ryan added. ""But no one person controls this party. This is a bottom-up, organic grassroots party based on conservative principles.""Ryan decision to appear on Sykes' show and declare that Trump does not control the Republican party is interesting, as Sykes has spent months attacking Trump on Wisconsin talk radio.In turn, Sykes- who was relatively unknown on the national stage prior this election- has appeared on MSNBC to attack the then-Republican nominee, now president-elect Trump.As Sykes was repeatedly denouncing the party's chosen standard bearer, Ryan took to Twitter to thank Sykes for his ""commitment to advancing conservative principles in WI & nationally.""Thanks @SykesCharlie for a great run on MKE radio. We appreciate your commitment to advancing conservative principles in WI & nationally.-- Paul Ryan (@PRyan) October 4, 2016Despite Sykes' and Ryan's repeated denunciations of the Republican nominee, Trump not only won the presidential election (which Ryan was unable to do when he was on the GOP ticket), but he also won Ryan's home state of Wisconsin (which Ryan was also unable to do when he was on the GOP ticket).Trump ran on a platform that is in direct opposition to Ryan's personal agenda- particularly on the key issues of trade, immigration, and crime. Ryan now says that Trump has earned a ""mandate"" from the American people.It is unclear whether the conservative House Freedom Caucus- led by Congressman Jim Jordan- will vote for Ryan to remain as House Speaker in light of the fact that Trump was given a ""mandate"" to enact policies that are the exact opposite of Ryan's open borders, trade, and immigration agenda.Following Trump's victory, Sykes tweeted that he was ""eating crow.""Well, at least I know what's for breakfast this morning. pic.twitter.com/YNjawdnRWF-- Real Charlie Sykes (@SykesCharlie) November 9, 2016In October, Sykes announced that he plans to retire from his daily radio show by the end of this year.Thanks @SykesCharlie for a great run on MKE radio.

The review shows that since 1988, issues coverage was rarely less than 114 minutes and was usually over 200 minutes of air time on the three networks combined. But for the 2016 campaign the nets had given the issues a scant 32 minutes of air time two weeks before Election Day.Instead of reports on guns, health care policy, terrorism prevention plans, security, economics and the like, the networks centered their reports on fitness for office, honesty, trustworthiness, controversies, stamina, the candidates' health, and other such issues.""With just two weeks to go,"" Tyndall wrote on October 25, ""issues coverage this year has been virtually non-existent.

Portland police tried to maintain with tear gas and flash bangs, but did little to deter the anti-Trump crowd that remained in the streets for hours.As TV station KGQ reported:The protest began as a peaceful rally at City Hall at 5 p.m. before protesters split into what appeared to be three groups at around 7 p.m. There were at least 1,000 protesters and police said there were reports of vandalism and assault. Several people have been arrested.One group, organized by Portland's Resistance, stayed at the rally in City Hall. Despite pleas from police earlier in the day, some protesters began marching on Southwest 4th Avenue, only to be stopped by police, who advised the crowd to march on a facilitated northbound route.A second group followed police orders and began marching north.

Several people have been arrested.
One group, organized by Portland's Resistance, stayed at the rally in City Hall. Despite pleas from police earlier in the day, some protesters began marching on Southwest 4th Avenue, only to be stopped by police, who advised the crowd to march on a facilitated northbound route.
A second group followed police orders and began marching north.

Congressional leadership seems poised to give Donald Trump a blank check. Together, they could send our country back decades, undoing so much of the progress we've made.Their wish list is long, and every item on it is devastating: Repealing the Affordable Care Act, filling Supreme Court seats with justices who've vowed to overturn Roe v. Wade, taking rights and protections away from women, LGBTQ folks, people of faith, and people of color.Trump and the next Congress need to know -- right now -- just how strong our movement is. They need to be reminded that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, that a majority of voters chose her progressive, inclusive vision for America -- not theirs. They need to see that we will never back down when it comes to people's health and rights. That we will fight with everything we have.Richards asks supporters to sign the following pledge, which echoes Democratic leaders' reliance on rallying diversity groups into a national coalition.To lawmakers and others who think they have a ""mandate"" to push policies that punish and attack women, people of color, the LGBTQ community, people of faith, people with disabilities, and others and strip away their rights, hear this:We are bigger and stronger and more powerful and more committed than you know. We won't shrink or hide away. We're standing strong -- ready to fight. For our lives. For our health.

We will not stand for attacks and discrimination based on color of skin or religion. Americans also understand that immigration is good for our country and want immigrants treated with dignity and respect.In short, you may occupy powerful positions now.

And we have no intention of letting you abuse your power to take us back.We are the majority, and we will show up and shut down any attempts to take away our rights, harm us and our loved ones, and jeopardize our future.In an interview Wednesday, Richards admitted the Supreme Court decision in the case of Roe v. Wade ""was on the ballot in this election"" on Tuesday.Richards, who actively campaigned for Hillary Clinton - the first candidate Planned Parenthood ever endorsed in a primary election - told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that she ""absolutely"" thinks the overturn of Roe v. Wade is possible in a Donald Trump administration.""I mean, I think that Roe vs. Wade was on the ballot in this election,"" she continued, according to CNSNews.com. ""I know that Mr. Trump has said that in his acceptance speech that he was going to govern for all Americans - not just ones that voted for him - and I hope that includes women.""Richards, however, has testified before Congress that ""abortion is health care,"" an idea that is denounced by many of the very pro-life Americans who voted for Trump.While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to repeal and replace Obamacare and to appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices. The president-elect has also said Planned Parenthood should be defunded.Planned Parenthood has been attempting to justify its abortion business and taxpayer funding, especially over the past year since the release of videos that allege the group has illegally sold the body parts of babies it aborts in its clinics for a profit.Abortion proponents have experienced melt-downs following Trump's stunning victory, even to the extent of urging women to have IUDs implanted prior to the president-elect's inauguration in order to obtain them for ""free,"" or, on the taxpayer's dime.Richards also noted during the interview that supporters ""have been dropping off baked goods"" at Planned Parenthood clinics following the Nov. 8 elections.As a candidate, Donald Trump laid out a dangerous and divisive agenda that could hurt tens of millions of Americans.

12	http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/11/12/president-mexico-wants-negotiate-wall/	President of Mexico wants to Negotiate that “Wall”	"Although Donald Trump's election was shocking to the Mexican government, President Enrique Pena Nieto was one of first world leaders to congratulate President-elect Trump and seems ready to negotiate a new economic deal to prevent a trade war.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMexico is very worried that President Trump will actually follow through on his promises to conduct massive deportations, to apply new trade tariffs and to demand renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Pena Nieto's invitation for Trump to make an official Mexican visit in August now seems brilliant.The Mexican government promised to intervene in currency markets to prevent any disruptive fall in the peso from the U.S. elections. But Mexico's financial markets have been hammered since Election Day, with their peso currency crashing by 13 percent.This week's panic selling was worse than the start of Mexico's 1994 ""Tequila Crisis."" That disaster came a year after the signing of NAFTA in December 1993 by Mexico's President Carlos Salinas and U.S. President Bill Clinton.NAFTA suddenly opened unlimited access to Mexico's formerly protected consumer and industrial markets. The ensuing U.S. export boom saw America's balance of payments surplus with Mexico spike over 1,000 percent to $29.4 billion in 1994. But the resulting capital flight forced Mexico's central bank to raise interest rates, dramatically.Mexican banks began to collapse as borrowers could no longer pay loans. The Mexican government was forced to let the peso's exchange rate ""float."" With the peso suffering a 50 percent devaluation and Mexico about to default, the country had to ask the U.S. for a bailout. Mexico still has access to a $90 billion IMF credit line granted 22 years ago.Mexico has huge risk in a trade war with President Donald Trump and the United States. About 90 percent of U.S.-based fortune 500 companies now have made substantial investments in Mexico. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis' report from 2012, U.S. multinational enterprises employed 1,106,700 people in Mexico, but Mexican companies only employ 68,800 in the United States.America's trading relationship with Mexico is not equal, but a number of U.S. companies and their workers do benefit from NAFTA. Mexico is America's second-largest export market, with $236 billion, or 15.7 percent, of all U.S. exports in 2015. That is up 468 percent since NAFTA was signed in 1993.But NAFTA has been so remarkably successful that Mexico, with $400 billion in exports, is now the 12th largest export economy in the world. That has only been possible because 80 percent of Mexico's exports go to the United States.Mexico's finance minister recently announced a 2017 budget of about $234 billion. That number is 2 percent less than this year's budget, and does not provide any of the $12 billion to build a 50-foot-high concrete wall along the 1,989 mile U.S./Mexico border for which Donald Trump promised Mexico would pay.Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto's phone call to President-elect Trump early on the morning of November 9 has already sparked agreement for a meeting before President-elect Trump is inaugurated in January, according to Stratfor Global Intelligence.The outreach seems to indicates that Mexico values their its relationship with the U.S. and will be ""flexible"" in negotiations to maintain it.SIGN UP"

Trump stunned political insiders, beltway prognosticators, and global elites when he emerged victorious as President-elect of the United States of America.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHis success represented a repudiation of corporate media, a repudiation of the ""America last"" policies of transnational ""Kingmakers,"" and a repudiation of the entrenched Washington establishment-- which Trump repeatedly described as a ""swamp"" he intends to ""drain"" as President.His success also represented the final victory of late-conservative icon and grassroots legend Phyllis Schlafly, who passed away just two months before the candidate--whom she viewed as the culmination of a grassroots movement she had led for over half a century--ascend to the highest office in the nation.Schlafly was one of Trump's earliest and most influential endorsements. With her backing, the populist billionaire went on to win more votes in a Republican primary than any GOP nominee in U.S. history.Schlafly devoted herself fully to her effort to inspire conservatives to unite and propel Trump to victory on November 8th. Her final book, released the day after she passed away, was titled The Conservative Case for Trump and was penned as a final rallying cry from the woman who spent more than one quarter of all American history leading the conservative grassroots into battle.""The revolution to take back America starts now,"" Schlafly wrote. ""Donald Trump might seem an unlikely candidate to some, but he offers the American public something it's been yearning for: 'a choice, not an echo'; a candidate not intimidated by political correctness or the liberal media. Donald Trump is our choice for president not only because he can win... but also because when you examine what he says and believes, you discover an American patriot with policies that will make America great again.""Similarly, her final video message to her followers urged voters to defy the ""Kingmakers"" and corporate media by supporting Trump for President.""Don't listen to the Kingmakers or the media as they try to mislead you and scare you,"" the godmother of the conservative movement told viewers. ""Donald Trump is the strong leader America needs at this time. He will make us proud. I'm Phyllis Schlafly and I'm voting for Donald Trump.""Unfortunately, the 92-year-old conservative warrior did not live long enough to cast her vote for the man and the movement that she saw as the realization of her life's work for her country. Yet, her work is reflected in his victory, prominent nation-state conservatives tell Breitbart.In September, Trump himself explained that Schlafly's endorsement made all the difference to his success. ""Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago when it wasn't necessarily something that was so easy to do. And she was incredible. She was so brave,"" Trump said. ""And I will never forget that. [Her endorsement] had a huge impact. She was a great, great powerful woman with a tremendous heart.""""Thank you, Phyllis,"" nationally syndicated talk radio host and vocal Trump supporter Laura Ingraham said after Trump's victory on election day.""I have no doubt that Phyllis is looking down on this victory and smiling,"" Ingraham added. ""I bet her prayerful intercession on our behalf really helped and I know her decades of work for the founding principles of America helped make this win possible.""""Phyllis Schlafly, in her vast political wisdom, knew the winning issues and messaging that would win the hearts and minds of Americans,"" said Ed Martin, President of Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense Fund. Schlafly had hand-picked Martin going into the 2016 election to help her in her efforts to shape the Republican party platform.""She recognized, years ago, that job-exporting free traders and globalists had infiltrated the Republican Party and alienated the blue-collar, working Americans of our great industrial nation,"" Martin added. ""[On election] night, Phyllis's support of Donald Trump and prediction of his election was fulfilled... We continue to be astounded by Phyllis's political foresight and wisdom, and we will continue to work to advance her legacy of fighting for America first.""As Schlalfy's son said at his mother's funeral mass, ""My mother... saw in him the embodiment of her classic work that she wrote in 1964, A Choice Not An Echo. As she was telling me last year, this person [i.e. Trump] is the choice, not an echo.""Indeed, Schlafly repeatedly explained that she viewed Trump as the ""only hope to defeat the Kingmakers""-- i.e. a bipartisan clique of international elites who control the political system and who, for their own personal pocket-book reasons, support ""America Last"" policies that prioritize the needs of other nations and international corporations above the needs of America and her citizens.""Trump is the only hope to defeat the Kingmakers,"" Schlafly told Breitbar News almost precisely one year ago. ""Because everybody else will fall in line. The Kingmakers have so much money behind them.""""The Kingmakers have a vested interest in preventing-- at all costs--the election of a president... who will... curtail the foreign giveaway programs"" and whose policies ""will serve the best interests of the United States of America"" rather than global special interests, Schlafly wrote in 1964.Schlafly explained that the Kingmakers have at their disposal unimaginable resources to aid in the enactment of their agenda, not least of which is their control of corporate media. In particular, Schlafly singled out the New York Times, which she described in 1964 as the ""chief propaganda organ of the secret Kingmakers.""Schlafly believed that Trump's ""America first"" platform was diametrically opposed to the Kingmaker's ""America Last"" agenda. She predicted that Trump would be successful because the American people wanted ""a fighter"" and because he represented ""everything the grassroots want,"" particularly on the issues of immigration and trade. Schlafly said:The Establishment- the people I call the Kingmakers- have been picking our candidates for so many years and they've given us a whole bunch of losers. And I think people want a fighter. The Kingmakers [have picked] one loser after another because they were more interested in maintaining their flow of money from the big donors and their cooperation with the Democrats--their bipartisanship--and that's not my goal. I'm for America [Schlafly slammed her hand on table] and America first [slammed her hand down again].""I think that we need to respect the will of the majority. Republicans ought to be a grassroots party. And the grassroots certainly agree with Donald Trump on most issues, but certainly on the immigration issue... I certainly think he represents everything the grassroots want,"" Schlafly told Breitbart News last year.Schlafly shared what she viewed as Trump's compassion for the ""forgotten"" working-class men and women of the country who have been overlooked by politicians controlled by corporate special interest donors. As Schlafly explained in 2009--seven years before the grassroots defied the odds and secured Trump's historic victory--she believed her legacy and the lesson of her fabled career in political activism was that ""the grassroots can organize, and take on all the powers that be and defeat them.""""That is the lesson,"" Schlafly said.Interestingly, while Schlafly's chosen candidate has pledged to ""make America great again,"" in 1963 the publisher of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat wrote: ""Phyllis Schlafly stands for everything that has made America great and for those things which will keep it that way.""As was custom for Schlafly, she never shied away from a principled fight even if it meant she had to take on members of her own party. In championing Trump's candidacy, Schlafly took on--what Pat Buchanan has described as-- the ""Davos conservatives"" at the National Review (whom Schlafly herself denounced as no ""authority on conservatism""), she took on Fox News, she took on Bill Kristol and the editors of the Weekly Standard, she took on Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, and she was even forced to confront opposition from members of her own family.She did all of this because she saw 2016 as America's ""last chance""-- explaining that if immigration is not curbed, ""we're not going to be America anymore.""In September, Donald Trump attended and spoke at Schlafly's funeral mass. He was joined by his wife Melania, his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, his deputy campaign manager David Bossie, and his campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon. Perhaps symbolic of her patriotism and her undying love of country, Schlafly's funeral mass concluded with attendees being led in singing ""America the Beautiful.""""In all of her battles, she never strayed from one guiding principle: she was for America, and it was always, always America first. People have forgotten that nowadays. For Phyllis, it was America first,"" Trump said at Schlafly's funeral. The President-elect went on to say:She never wavered, never apologized, and never backed down in taking on the kingmakers. She never stopped fighting for the fundamental idea that the American people ought to have their needs come before anything or anyone else. She loved our country, she loved her family and she loved her God. Her legacy will live on every time some underdog, outmatched and outgunned, defies the odds, and delivers a win for the people. America has always been about the underdog, and always been about defying the odds. The idea that so-called ""little people"" or the ""little-person"" that she loved so much could beat the system- often times the rigged system... that the American grassroots is more powerful than all the world's special interests put together- that's the way Phyllis felt. She's always felt that way. That's the romance of America. That's the story of the mother and the patriot that we honor here today... Phyllis, who is rejoined with her late husband Fred, is looking down on us right now and I'm sure she's telling us to keep up the fight, no doubt. Phyllis we love you, we miss you and we will never ever let you down.The Establishment- the people I call the Kingmakers- have been picking our candidates for so many years and they've given us a whole bunch of losers.

""You're supposed to be able to vote in peace! It's supposed to be part of our democracy. And what happened is, I vote for somebody, and I get beaten, robbed, and my car stolen, and I have no way of getting my wife to and from work safe anymore,"" he told the Chicago Tribune's news crew.The attack came as Democrats lashed out at Americans for their surprise defeat on Nov. 8. For example, retiring Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid said Friday that Trump has ""emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry"" and ""has directed crowds of thousands to intimidate reporters and assault African-Americans.""Wilcox, 49, said the shocking attack happened after a black Sedan scraped the side of his vehicle on Wednesday.""What's your reaction as you watch this?"" a Chicago Tribune reporter asks Wilcox as he's shown the cellphone-recorded video of the attack.""I was scared,"" Wilcox said. ""The car pulled up next to me. We side-swiped each other. But they hit my car,"" he continued. ""I put the car in park. The light was red. I got out of the car.""That's when Wilcox says he was targeted for the violent beating and carjacking.""One of the guys, an African American at the bus stop, said: 'Yeah, that's one of those white boy Trump supporters,'"" he said. ""And I said: 'What does that have to do with this accident? I just want to exchange insurance.'""""Next thing I know, the guy said, 'Don't worry about it, we're gonna beat his ass!' And then punches were thrown, and the next thing I know, I have five people on me. And I fell to the ground; I was kicked in the head. They were in my car, stealing all my stuff,"" he said.""I tried to go to the car. I got hit some more. I tried to get into a defensive stance to ward off them off a little bit, hold them back, and then another guy said, 'Get the car! Get the car!'"" Wilcox continued. ""And then when he started up the car, my driver's window and my childproof back window was open, and I put my arm around it. The guy took off--he took off and he was doing 70 or 80 [miles per hour] down Roosevelt [Road], swerving.""""He was trying to get me to fall off, and I knew if I somehow let go, I was gonna die."" Wilcox said. When the car slowed, Wilcox let go, and rolled into oncoming traffic several times.He was stunned that he was profiled and targeted for what the mob assumed was his private decision in the voting booth.""It's a predominantly African American neighborhood,"" he continued.They started yelling things like, 'Oh, there's one of those Trump white boys.' And then, I did make a comment and say, 'What does that have to do with it? So what if I support Trump?'  You know, he might not speak perfect--I didn't say that to them, but he might not speak perfectly politically correct, but he's the best man for the job. He's the one that's going to bring back jobs, the trade, get the people that are here illegally out, bring back jobs for people that deserve the jobs that have been there their whole lives, that might not have a full education and can't get a job.Breitbart News has previously reported how the press has portrayed Trump and his supporters as racist, sexist, Islamaphobic, a demagogue, Hitler, subconsciously Hitler, and not Hitler but Mussolini. Meanwhile, even conservative sites attack his working class white supporters, saying ""deserve to die,""  and ""deserve to be beaten.""The press scoffed at the countless death threats made at Trump, gave generous airtime to would-be assassins, in one instance calling an illegal alien who stole a cop's gun to take a shot at Trump ""a good guy with a gun.""Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton denigrated Trump's supporters on the campaign trail, calling one half of them ""racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it,"" who belong in what she calls ""the basket of deplorables."" Some of his American supporters are ""irredeemable"" and ""not America,"" she added. They started yelling things like, 'Oh, there's one of those Trump white boys.'

Trump -- the name really has a sweet ring to it! -- has earned a mandate unlike any predecessor in more than 30 years.He overcame all the odds, beat back both political parties, jumped around all the powerful special interest industries that own Washington and scored an unprecedented victory for the people.And he did it all while circumventing the massive media machine that worked in lockstep unison to block him at every turn. Every mainstream newspaper and television outlet -- after months of gorging themselves at the profit trough of his monster ratings -- shirked all pretense of covering the election fairly.Mr. Trump -- excuse me, President-elect Trump -- was smeared as a racist, xenophobic misogynist with tiny hands and a small bank account.Then he beat the last GOP standard-bearer among blacks and Hispanics. Even Hillary Clinton's much ballyhooed appeal to women shrank a bit from President Obama's levels in the past two elections. Those right there are the single most devastating statistics out of the whole election. The mainstream media has cried wolf for the last time. Nobody is listening to any of them anymore.The only people left believing these liars and slime artists are these melting snowflakes calling in sick and hovering in safe places under their beds -- the dopes marching in the streets demanding civility as they shout threats to grab Trump by his genitals.Or these thug criminals beating the tar out of a Trump voter at a street intersection.These snowflakes need to tread very, very carefully because these kinds of wild and violent and ugly demonstrations will only strengthen President-elect Trump and his now-vocal majority.Anyway, these people have no one to blame but themselves and the outgoing current President, Barack Obama, who promised them the world and promised all of us a healed country. ""Post-racial"" they were calling it in 2008.Well, he has surely failed on that score. Race relations in this country have not been this ugly and strained in decades. The president's divisive, racialist language and posture throughout his presidency has set the country back many, many painful years.Now we have a new president.

Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump hasn't yet publicly named a chief of staff, but already, a major tea party group is warning him against naming one of his reported top choices.

The Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund warned against a ""Washington insider"" to run Trump's White House, specifically naming Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who is said to be one of Trump's top two choices.
Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of TPPCF, told CNN in a statement that the group wants Trump to ""drain the swamp.""

""No Washington insider, regardless of who it is, should serve as President Trump's chief of staff,"" Martin said. ""Appointing Reince Priebus (or any other DC establishment insider) would make it more difficult, not less, for President Trump to achieve the change the people voted for. It's time to drain the swamp -- not promote insiders beholden to the Washington establishment who helped create it.""

Trump's choice for chief of staff is coming down to two men who have closely advised him, but whose backgrounds and political styles could not be more different: Priebus and Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign CEO and executive chairman of Breitbart News.

Priebus would be a reassuring presence to establishment Republicans still uncertain about what a Trump White House will look like.
He would also bring decades of political experience and understanding of the wheels of power -- as a Washington insider.

Massie further indicated that if no conservative steps up to run to fill Ryan's job, he'd be open to doing it himself.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""We need change,"" Massie explained. ""If it came to that, I would do it.""""In just a few days [November 15th] there'll be the nomination, and the constitutional election will happen on January 3rd. Presently Paul Ryan does not have my vote,"" Massie said in a podcast with Reason's Nick Gillespie.When Gillespie pressed him on whether he would run to fill Speaker Ryan's job himself, Massie said: ""Somebody has to. I'm not saying I will do it, but we need change. I would rather give my vote to somebody who will support the platform [that upholds regular order], but if it came to that, I would do it.""The nation is facing ""a constitutional crisis... thanks to Paul Ryan,"" Massie explained:The next Speaker needs to let Congress debate whether we should be involved in all these military conflicts. We've got a constitutional crisis right now thanks to John Boehner and thanks to Paul Ryan, where we're involved in military conflicts around the globe that have not been authorized by Congress, and these are not short term conflicts.While Massie noted that his own opposition to Ryan's Speakership stems largely from procedural issues rather than specific policies, other conservative lawmakers have expressed concern that Ryan's policy agenda, as well as his demonstrations of poor leadership throughout the election season, have made him unfit to run the Republican party in Congress.In particular, some lawmakers have pointed to Ryan's efforts to seemingly undermine Trump's campaign. Last month, Congressman Mark Meadows said that a lot of conservatives ""question the loyalty of the Speaker"" in light of Ryan's treatment of Trump and said that the push to remove Ryan as Speaker was ""picking up some steam.""Moreover, on particular policies, while Ryan himself has acknowledged that Trump has ""earned a mandate"" from the American people, Trump was given a ""mandate"" to enact policies that stand in direct opposition to Ryan's personal agenda on pivotal issues like trade, immigration, and crime.For instance, Trump ran on a platform of immigration controls, whereas Ryan has been an active champion of open borders. According to Pew polling data, 92 percent of the GOP electorate oppose Ryan's vision for expanding immigration levels and instead want to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.Similarly, Trump ran against globalist trade policies, whereas Ryan supports the multinational trade policies backed by the Republican Party's donor class. Ryan even worked as President Obama's ""partner"" to fast track the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. According to polling data from a recent POLITICO Pro-Harvard survey, 85 percent of GOP voters disagree with Speaker Ryan's vision on the issue of trade and believe that so-called ""free trade"" has lost the U.S. more jobs than it has created.Massie told Gillespie that, while he was not initially a Trump supporter, he ""decided to get on the Trump train"" after he became the party's nominee.""Trump may have been the only one [of the 17 Republican candidates] on that stage who could win Pennsylvania and Michigan while not losing Florida. And it's got some interesting ramifications for the Republican party,"" Massie said. Trump's victory ""represents an implosion of the Republican party and maybe a realignment.""Massie continued:There has been a religion in the Republican Party and it's called free trade and if you did anything to question some of the trade deals you immediately got branded as a protectionist... there's always sort of been this holier-than-thou, ""you're a protectionist"" if you start talking about the rules of trade... [But] Trump captured Pennsylvania, and Michigan and Ohio--the Rust Belt, if you will--by talking about this issue and challenging some of those assumptions.Indeed, by running against Speaker Ryan's agenda on trade, immigration, and crime, Trump was not only able to win the presidential election (which Ryan was unable to do when he was on the GOP ticket), but he was also able to win Ryan's home state of Wisconsin (which Ryan was also unable to do when he was on the GOP ticket).Trump now ""has a mandate,"" Massie said -- particularly on the issue of immigration and building a wall along the southern border. Massie explained that if Congress were to get in Trump's way on this issue, he believes ""the next stage will be pitchforks and torches in Washington.""I think there are a couple things that Trump has to do and if he doesn't do these things, or if Congress gets in the way of him doing these things, the next stage will be pitchforks and torches in Washington D.C. One of those things is repeal and replace Obamacare... The other thing I think... is I think he's got to start building a wall. He's got a mandate there... he said he was going to build a wall, he got elected with over 300 electoral votes and I think it's going to start happening or else some people are going to be very upset.In recent days, Ryan has ducked answering questions about whether he will now champion Trump's proposed border wall along the southern border. Ryan has also not said whether, in light of Trump's ""mandate,"" he now recants his former statements denouncing Trump's plan to enforce immigration law and allow ICE officers to do their job by removing individuals in the country unlawfully.""I was not surprised [when Trump won],"" Massie said. ""And let me tell you something that really insults me and most of middle America: is when the media keeps calling it a stunning upset. How can it be a stunning upset if fully half of the country thought that he could or would win? It's not a stunning upset. What's stunning is their inability to get outside of their bubble and see that he could win--and that's not even stunning that's just par for the course.""For his part, Ryan seemed to express surprise in the aftermath of Trump's victory, declaring: ""Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard.""By ""no one else,"" Ryan seems to be referring to beltway elites and party insiders, including himself, who failed to listen to the people's desires on some of the most seminal issues addressed during the election and who instead championed open borders trade and immigration policies opposed by the Republican and American electorate.It is unclear whether the House Freedom Caucus, led by Jim Jordan, will support Ryan and allow him to remain as the Republican leader in Congress given the fact that Ryan stands opposed to roughly 9 in 10 GOP voters on the key issues of immigration and trade.The next Speaker needs to let Congress debate whether we should be involved in all these military conflicts. We've got a constitutional crisis right now thanks to John Boehner and thanks to Paul Ryan, where we're involved in military conflicts around the globe that have not been authorized by Congress, and these are not short term conflicts.There has been a religion in the Republican Party and it's called free trade and if you did anything to question some of the trade deals you immediately got branded as a protectionist... there's always sort of been this holier-than-thou, ""you're a protectionist"" if you start talking about the rules of trade...

Video provided to Breitbart News shows two suspects ripping down a Trump sign before driving away:WATCH: Prince told Breitbart News that the two suspects caught trespassing and destroying his property on tape, who were later arrested, were working for the local government on a contract and committed these crimes on company time and the taxpayer's dime.""This out-of-state contractor employs illegals and underbids legit Virginia businesses while displacing legal Americans from work,"" Prince said. Trump won on Tuesday because of incidents like this, Prince said, ""because people see that all over the place and they say enough is enough.""It's a priority of Prince's to ensure the illegal alien is deported after being charged and convicted. If illegal aliens are caught committing a crime while in the country illegally, they should be subject to automatic deportation, he said.Under the outgoing Obama administration, deportations dramatically fell overall, especially deportations of illegal aliens who went on to commit more crimes on U.S. soil -- those have dropped sixty percent since 2011. U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) also released over 86,000 criminal illegal aliens from custody since 2013, many of whom had committed violent crimes.The administration's ""Priority Enforcement Program"" all but ignored the vast majority of illegal aliens and would have allowed 87 percent of the 11 million to 20 or 30 million illegal aliens remain in the U.S.SIGN UPhis out-of-state contractor employs illegals and underbids legit Virginia businesses while displacing legal Americans from work,"" Prince said.

And he pledged to organize his campaign to ensure every voice is heard--particularly for those who have been ignored or left behind.""Further, Villaraigosa took the opportunity to take a shot at President-elect Donald Trump. His press release wrote that he former mayor, ""noted his entry into the race for governor just two days after Donald Trump was elected president created a clear contrast between a California vision of shared prosperity and the national political climate.""In an interview with KQED on Thursday, Villaraigosa said he has spent recent weeks on a ""listening"" tour around the state. He reportedly said, ""What I've heard is that people want their voices heard, so this campaign and this candidacy is about giving voice to every Californian -- and particularly after this election, I think my candidacy is particularly poised to be an answer to the divisive nature of our politics. We need to be promoting unity, not division, and the answer to fear is hope.""California Lieutenant Gov.

Tom Price (R-GA) proposed to repeal and replace Obamacare, introducing the ""Empowering Patients First Act,"" which provided for those with pre-existing conditions. ""[T]o make sure no one is priced out of the health insurance market because of a pre-existing illness or injury, the Empowering Patients First Act provides for the creation of robust pooling plans that would ensure that any one person's health status does not increase his or her costs or the costs of others in the same pool,"" he wrote at the time.Coverage for pre-existing conditions, and coverage for young people, are relatively minor parts of the overall architecture of Obamacare. Conservatives have long been willing to accept such provisions as compromises, the better to shore up political support for dismantling the system as a whole.Trump merely stated the obvious.Photo: feilJoel B.

Huelskamp: Speaker Ryan Does Not Have 218 Votes	"The chairman of the House Tea Party Caucus and one of the first men to come out against Speaker John A. Boehner told Breitbart News that he does not think Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R.-Wis.) has the votes to keep his gavel.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""I just don't think he has the votes,"" said Rep. Timothy A. Huelskamp (R.-Kansas), who lost his primary Aug. 2 and returns to private life after this session of Congress.Huelskamp said he is concerned that the House Republican leadership is in a hurry to, first, get itself rubber-stamped inside the conference and then to proceed with an aggressive lame duck agenda.Many House conservatives have called for the leadership elections to be moved forward from the scheduled Nov. 15 event, he said.It is important to watch what the GOP leadership does before returning Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers to their posts, he said.The conference elections are by voice vote, which masks the weakness of Ryan's support with House Republicans and could be chaotic if and when he fails to reach the required 218 votes when the new Congress meets.""There is no doubt Ryan has the support of the majority of the conference, but we will not find out if he has enough until January,"" he said.""You got to have 218,"" the congressman said. ""Just because you have 215 doesn't get you 218.Huelskamp said he does not know who could possibly emerge as a rival to Ryan, but that also does not matter because the House rules do not require an opponent for someone to lose; all that is required is the 218 threshold.""I was surprised over the years that when Boehner was on the ropes, no one would step forward,"" the congressman said. ""Paul Ryan? He wanted it and he got it.""It was also a surprise to Huelskamp that the chairman of the House Finance Committee, Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R.-Texas), a former chairman of the House GOP Conference, never made a run for it.""Hensarling was always the guy that I thought would do it, could do it, and would have had the votes,"" he said. ""Hensarling loves his job, but he knows the leadership will never let him take on Dodd-Frank."" Dodd-Frank is the financial services reform legislation, Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The Kansan said that, in the lame duck session itself, he expects to see two bills come up that no one is expecting--the Internet Sales Tax and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, negotiated by President Barack Obama with our Pacific trading partners.Before the current recess, the speaker led House Republicans to believe that he would not push for the TPP deal, but Huelskamp said if you read between the lines, Ryan actually left the door open. ""He said it was not good enough, it needs to be renegotiated-it needs this, it needs that-but, he did not say: 'We are not going to do it.'""For six years, Republicans have blocked Democratic attempts to pass an Internet Sales Tax that would circumvent the 1992 Supreme Court Quill Decision, which ruled that the Quill office supply company was not obligated to collect sales taxes for states other than the state in which it was located.Huelskamp said there is an Internet Sales Tax bill all ready to go, written by the staff of the House Judiciary Committee and supported by the GOP leadership.The tax bill is set to be sprung without warning, he said. ""No discussion before we went home. No discussion of that at all, not on the agenda-sounds like a typical insider lame duck deal.""For his own swansong, the congressman said he is ready to make a privileged motion forcing a vote on the impeachment of the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.In September, Huelskamp and his fellow member of the House Freedom Caucus Rep. John Fleming (R.-La.), a candidate for the Senate, were ready to make the motion, but the night before they had planned to execute the plan he announced that they would wait until after the election. One of the reasons House Conservatives were counting on Huelskamp and Fleming was that both men were leaving the House at the end of the session and would be immune from retribution from the House Republican Leadership.Because the motion is a privileged motion, it must be voted on at once without debate or amendments, but Capitol Hill sources have speculated to Breitbart News that leadership looks to table the motion either in a vote or decision by the presiding officer.Huelskamp said it was not his decision to stand down, but he went along with it because other conservatives begged him not to go through with it owing to the extreme pressure they were receiving from the leadership.""I was strongly discouraged by House Freedom Caucus members, who said, 'Now is not the time-we've got an understanding with Paul Ryan and the rest of the GOP leadership.'""It was all at the last minute, he said. ""I thought it was a mistake not to do it, but I didn't do it out of respect for those who have to deal with Paul Ryan.""A part of him suspects that the real reason members of the House Freedom Caucus lost their nerve was that they were afraid they would win, he said.Regardless of the deals made in September, Huelskamp said he is making the motion for impeachment, when Congress returns from its current recess and before Congress leaves for its Thanksgiving recess.The congressman, who holds a PhD in agricultural legislation, said he has not decided if he will run for Congress again after his term ends. He is convinced he was right on the issues, but he could not overcome the $2 million from outside the district that overwhelmed the voters beyond his own ability to get his message through.""I am not sure what I am going to do.""SIGN UP"

Her loss has already changed the political landscape:Just days after Donald Trump surprise victory, U.S. officials said Republican congressional leaders had made clear that they wouldn't consider the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership in the remainder of Mr. Obama's term. The White House had lobbied hard for months in the hope of moving forward on the pact if the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, had won.The TPP had faced opposition from both left and right. On the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and others criticized TPP for the same reasons they have long opposed free trade agreements -- namely, they are concerned that unionized American workers would face competition from lower-wage counterparts abroad, and that countries with fewer environmental regulations would attract American industries.Conservative opposition to the TPP focused on the secret nature of the negotiations, as well as growing mistrust of Obama's conduct in foreign affairs, where he was seen to have misled the public about key aspects of the Iran nuclear deal.Trump, long a critic of free trade agreements -- though a professed supporter of free trade -- slammed TPP frequently on the campaign trail. Hillary Clinton had praised the deal, but flip-flopped on the agreement as it lost ground to Sanders's campaign.Obama himself was a late convert to free trade, having opposed earlier agreements in the Senate.Joel B.

28	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/11/clinton-supporters-hope-shock-ending-electoral-college/	Clinton Supporters Hope for Shock Ending in the Electoral College	"Liberals have lost faith in the Electoral College (EC), with Hillary Clinton having narrowly won the popular vote nationwide.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAs petitions to abolish the EC whizzing across the Internet, over at the Huffington Post, we see this declaration blossom into a plan to use the Electoral College to overturn the election and install someone else as President:The requirement here is modest: a small group of Republican electors must be persuaded to vote their conscience. No question that many of these are appalled at the prospect of a Trump presidency; surely a few are courageous enough to cast a vote for someone else. (Most if not all would vote for another Republican, of course; it doesn't seem likely that many would choose Hillary Clinton.) Depending upon how current recounts turn out, somewhere between a minimum of ten and a maximum of thirty-seven electors would have to defect in order to bring Trump's count down to less than 270.If neither party ends up with 270 votes, then the decision passes to the House of Representatives, and a vote in that chamber determines the winner. The House is permitted to choose from among the three candidates who receive the most votes in the Electoral College. Hence, dissenting electors can rest assured that they -- and the voters they represent -- will end up with a Republican president.This is, of course, presented as a bipartisan initiative that ""responsible Republicans"" should join, as well as bitter, emotionally unstable Democrats. It is noted that electors cast their ballots anonymously, which ""shields individuals from retribution.""Confusingly for members of MoveOn.org, which suddenly doesn't seem all that interested in ""moving on,"" the left-wing group is circulating a petition to muscle ""faithless electors"" into turning against Trump, as well as a petition to abolish the Electoral College altogether.It's beyond hilarious to read screeds against the evils of ""direct democracy"" coming from the party that was, just two years ago, telling us the midterm elections were meaningless because President Obama should be an absolute dictator certified by democratic vote, and maybe it was time to do away with midterm elections, or possibly even Congress.Obama himself announced that not only was direct democracy super-awesome, as long as it empowered him, but he didn't even need to see the ballots, because he can read the minds of people who don't vote, and would defy the authority of Congress on their behalf.Is this scenario even possible? Well, as everyone pushing it notes, 21 states don't actually require their electors to vote for the pledged candidate, and the others mostly have laws that punish faithless electors, rather than preventing them from changing their votes. Michigan and Minnesota are the only states that automatically nullify the votes of renegade electors, and there is some debate in legal circles over whether any of the punitive laws could actually be enforced.The New York Times reviewed the history of the Electoral College on Election Day, and noted that while there have been examples of faithless electors, most of them are from long ago, and they've never affected the final result of a presidential election.The Times quoted the federal archives' declaration that ""throughout our history as a nation, more than 99 percent of electors have voted as pledged.""The last example of a faithless elector was an unknown soul from Minnesota who voted for John Edwards instead of John Kerry in 2004, which doesn't exactly cover the faithless electorate in glory.More recently, the 2016 election produced two threats of faithless Electoral College voting... from two Washington State Democrats who said they wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton, if she won the general election. One of them flatly refused to vote for her, the other refused to commit to voting for her. The one who said ""no, no, no on Hillary, absolutely not, no way"" was an American Indian, Robert Satiacum.  He said he was hoping the election would come down to a swing vote, and give him the chance to personally torpedo her candidacy.Cold water was showered upon the Electoral College revolt Friday from the surprising dark cloud of Vox, which declared that ""realistically, considering how big a lead Trump has, who the electors are, how their votes are counted, and hundreds of years of American democratic norms, it's a silly fantasy that is just in no way, shape, or form going to happen.""Vox hits on the most important reasons why, including the sheer magnitude of the task awaiting those who think they can bully enough Republican electors - they tend to be stalwart party men and women - into switching their vote, and the severe unlikelihood of the Republican House deciding to unleash nationwide chaos and intra-party Armageddon by throwing the election to someone other than Trump.The Huffington Post sneers dismissively that ""Trump supporters will scream; there will likely be violence, and perhaps riots"" if the Electoral College overturns the election. (Crack a window, kids - we've got that from Clinton supporters right now.)There's nothing desirable about unleashing the kind of uncertainty that an eleventh-hour shock ending to the 2016 election would create, especially since faith in our government institutions is already at low tide. Plenty of people who aren't big fans of Donald Trump would be outraged by a maneuver that disenfranchised millions of voters, and threw the election to someone who wasn't even on the ballot. Aren't liberals supposed to be deeply, deeply concerned about disenfranchisement?No, Clinton fans, you're only courting heartache by dreaming of a miraculous Electoral College revolt. Better to kick back with few bottles of your favorite adult beverage and denounce the Electoral College as a tool of white supremacy and sexism. You can rejoin the rest of America in the real world after you sober up.The requirement here is modest: a small group of Republican electors must be persuaded to vote their conscience.

One source said that some in Virginia left for the border on Wednesday, the day Donald Trump was declared the winner,"" Paul Bedard reports in the Washington Examiner.As President-Elect Trump stated in a major policy speech in Phoenix, Arizona in August, every illegal alien in the U.S. is subject to deportation. There will be ""zero tolerance"" for illegal immigration under a Trump administration.""Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation - that is what it means to have laws and to have a country,"" Trump said.The 1.4 million illegal aliens who signed up for Obama's amnesty are prime targets for deportation. The incoming Trump administration will get their identities and addresses, along with their open admission that they broke into the country.""Four years ago I pointed out the fundamental problem with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program: Anyone who signed up for DACA would be adding their names to a list of self-identified illegal aliens. Should a future administration decide that it would start enforcing the law, the DACA program would provide list of prime candidates for deportation,"" writes John Miano at the non-partisan Center for Immigration Studies (CIS).""At the time, this was so obvious that I was surprised anyone would be stupid enough to sign up for DACA and DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans). Yet apparently hundreds of thousands of people did so anyway,"" he added.One million of the illegal aliens who got temporary amnesty are from Mexico. Over half  live in California or Texas.The news also destroys the media's false choice of either mass legalization or mass deportation of illegal aliens. Enforcing immigration laws across the board will gradually encourage many illegals to return to their home countries.And as a poll commissioned by CIS shows, majorities of Americans of every race support across-the-board enforcement and a reduction in immigration rates. The poll found that 54 percent of voters want immigration reduced by half or shut down completely, while 58 percent said that illegal aliens should not be allowed to remain in the U.S., even if they do not commit a ""serious crime.""SIGN UP"
