John McCain (R-AZ) refused to allow her to do so after they had pulled their resources out of the state.She then briefly considered ""going rogue"" and campaigning in Michigan anyway. That phrase became the title of her subsequent memoir, Going Rogue: An American Life, where she described her thoughts and feelings at the time.Palin recalled:Obama was leading by double digits [in Michigan], but the Grand Rapids meeting gave me hope that we could bounce back and turn the state around. I got to tell Michigan, ""Thank you for taking care of my son--now he's taking care of you!""...We kicked the next morning off with a lot of prep for the day's events, including an on-camera interview atop the hotel with Fox News reporter Carl Cameron, with the St. Louis Gateway Arch framed in the shot behind me. Among his other questions, he asked what I thought of the campaign pulling out of Michigan.""Yes, I read that this morning,"" I answered, then said I wished we weren't pulling out of Michigan--that every single person and every single vote mattered, and I sure didn't want anyone to give up anywhere. No harm giving a little shout-out to the Great Lakes State, I thought. No one had mentioned to the VP staff or me that the campaign was even considering pulling out of Michigan, much less that we already had. So when I was asked about it, I was caught a bit off guard, but I answered truthfully about having read about it in the newspaper. We moved on to the next question and wrapped up the interview. No big deal.But we soon heard that back at headquarters, it was a big deal. The word came hurtling down that I had been ""off script"" with Cameron. Of course, it's pretty easy to issue candid, off-script messages when there is no script to begin with. It wasn't the end of the world, though, and I hoped headquarters would forgive me and move on.They didn't. One or more McCain senior staffers would later anonymously tell reporters that I was ""going rogue.""The VP team had been scheduled to do another event in Michigan, but it was canceled, disappointing a lot of us who had appreciated that September 17 town hall meeting with John. Still, we understood that funding was limited, so I suggested to the VP staff that the next time we had an official event near Michigan, we pass the hat for gas money and just do a quick trip across the border to snap one off-the-record photo at a cafe or gas station, maybe hold a quick grassroots rally. I thought we would send a positive message to the state that way, show the people that our campaign really did care about their votes.It would be fast, it would be free, it would be...mavericky. What was the worst that could happen? We'd maybe get a few more votes? Headquarters said no. With the strange pushback we were getting by then, we were tempted just to sneak across the border. More than once, Nicolle had summarized the campaign organization well when, during chaotic moments, she turned to the B Team and said with a resigned smile, ""Welcome to the pirate ship."" But we didn't want our throats cut, so we dropped the road trip idea and tried to find a copy of the script so we could stay on it.I can't help but think of Michigan--the state where I ""went rogue"" trying to reach out to during the campaign. Some of the people in Michigan are hurting the most right now in our economic downturn.
Michigan is a good example of why we must stand up and not give up! We must fight for reform and fight to reclaim these places suffering under the weight of decades of failed big-government policies--the very policies that now threaten to overtake us all. We can't abandon Michigan and places like it. We're Americans. We don't give up on each other.I've been asked a lot lately, ""Where are you going next?"" Good question! I'll be heading home to Alaska, of course. Back to that kitchen table. We'll discuss the day's news and the next stop. I always tell my kids that God doesn't drive parked cars, so we'll talk about getting on the next road and gearing up for hard work to travel down it to reach new goals. I'm thinking when I get back I'll bake the kids a cake. And I'll pull out a road map--I want to show Piper the way to Michigan.Update: Palin has released a statement on Facebook:Going Rogue, again! Finally.Hitting the trail with Willow and Piper to get out the vote for our next President, Donald J. Trump.

When UK's Channel4 asked Zizek which presidential candidate he would vote for if he were American, Zizek quickly replied, ""Trump.""""I'm horrified at him,"" Zizek elaborated, ""[but] I'm just left thinking Hillary is the true danger. Why? She built an impossible, all-inclusive coalition. Look, the one point when I fully agreed with Trump was, you remember, when Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary? ... Trump said it's like somebody from Occupy Wall Street endorsing Lehman Brothers"":Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.-- Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016Zizek explained that Trump has been able to ""disturb"" the entrenched political system and argued that a Trump win could set into motion ""new political processes"":In every society, there is a whole network of unwritten rules, how politics works, and how you build consensus. And Trump disturbed this. If Trump wins, both major parties-Republicans and Democrats-would have to return to basics, rethink themselves, and maybe some things can happen there. ... It will be a kind of big awakening. New political processes will be set in motion, will be triggered.Zizek, who has been described as ""the Elvis of cultural theory,"" rejected the narrative that a Trump presidency would introduce fascism in America. ""Look, America is still not a dictatorial state. He will not introduce fascism,"" Zizek said.While the rockstar Lacanian Marxist professor, who has been described as a ""leftist rabble-rouser,"" said he was concerned by Trump's pledge to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices, Zizek explained that, in his view, the threat of a conservative court pales in comparison to the danger posed by a Hillary Clinton presidency:Listen, Trump has openly said ... he will nominate right-wingers [to the Supreme Court], so there are dangers [to a Trump presidency]. I'm just afraid that Hillary stands for this absolute inertia, the most dangerous one, because she's a cold warrior, and so on, connected with banks pretending to be socially progressive.Far-left progressive Jill Stein has similarly attacked Clinton for pretending to be socially progressive-describing her as a ""corporatist hawk"" who is ""hostile"" to the desires of progressives. Stein has warned that the role of corporate Democrats like Clinton is to ""prevent progressives from defying corporate rule.""Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

A recent test by Morning Consult, for example, shows that an estimated 7 percent of college graduates hide their support for Trump by telling phone-call pollsters that they support Clinton. If Trump wins in Michigan, he'll get the 270th Electoral Vote he needs to become president, providing he also wins the states where he's now edging Clinton. Both sides are rushing surrogates into the state help push up their support and to get their voters to the polls. President Barack Obama won the state's 16 Electoral Votes by 9.4 percentage points in 2012.The Free Press poll was released Friday, and it shows Clinton at 42 percent and Trump at 38 percent. According to the newspaper: Hillary Clinton is hanging onto a narrow 4-point lead over Donald Trump in Michigan heading into the last weekend before Tuesday's election, with a new Free Press poll showing clear momentum for the Republican nominee in a state that several weeks ago was believed all but decided for the Democrat.The poll, done exclusively for the Free Press by EPIC-MRA of Lansing, shows Clinton's support steady at 42% -- up a point from where it was late last month. But it also clearly shows Republicans and some independents rallying around Trump in the waning days of the campaign season, with his support up four points from two weeks ago to 38%.Meanwhile, the number of undecided voters -- 13% -- remains extraordinarily high for this late in an election cycleThe poll interviewed 600 likely voters, and it has a 4-point margin of error, meaning there's a 95 percent chance that each result is actually within 4 points of the true number. Also tracking poll by Fox 2 in Detroit showed Trump 3 points behind Clinton on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3. The poll was conducted by the Mitchell Poll of Michigan and quizzed 1,150 likely voters, and concluded:In the four-way ballot question that includes Libertarian Party candidate former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, it is Clinton 47% - Trump 44% - Johnson 4% - Stein 3% while 2% are undecided ... The percentages are almost exactly the same as they were the night before. ""Clinton's weakness with 65 and older white women continued again last night and Trump maintained his small lead with men,"" said a statement from Steve Mitchell, the CEO of Mitchell Research & Communications. The firm's Nov. 2 and Nov. 3 tracking polls showed how:Clinton did take back most of the support she lost with Democrats on Tuesday night.  Although she stanched the bleeding, Clinton's problems are taking a toll on her candidacy in Michigan and the state is now in play.  That is likely the reason we have we have seen most of the Trump family including the candidate in Michigan along with former President Bill Clinton.  Tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will be in town campaigning, more evidence of a close race.The Mitchell poll has a error margin of 2.89 percent, meaning each of the numbers may vary by 2.89 percent.On Nov. 2, a GOP polling firm, Strategic National, showed a gap of only 1 point in its poll of 500 Likely Voters in Michigan. The poll records Clinton's support at 45 percent, while Trump's support climbed to 44 percent. On Nov. 3, Trump drew level with Clinton, according to John Yob, CEO of the Strategic National polling firm.""Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are tied in Michigan and we truly have a dead heat going into the final weekend,"" Yob said in a statement to Breitbart News. Trump is over performing in key segments of the electorate especially in rural areas and Macomb County while Clinton is failing to get the numbers she needs out of the city of Detroit.  Michigan is likely to be very busy this weekend and could be the state that determines the next President of the United States.  Republicans have come a long way since Mitt Romney lost it by nearly 10 points just four years ago.The poll's error margin is 4.4 percent, meaning each of the numbers in the poll could be 4.4 percent high or lower.Currently, the Real Clear Politics polling site shows Clinton safely in the lede, with a 5.4 percent gap in a four-way race and a 4.6 percent advantage over Trump in a two-way race.Hillary Clinton is hanging onto a narrow 4-point lead over Donald Trump in Michigan heading into the last weekend before Tuesday's election, with a new Free Press poll showing clear momentum for the Republican nominee in a state that several weeks ago was believed all but decided for the Democrat.

However, the Republican-controlled House and, perhaps, a continuing Republican-controlled Senate, mean the passage of new controls will be nearly impossible. That takes us to option B, which is where Clinton might nominate an anti-Heller justice to SCOTUS, thereby positioning the court to re-open the door to municipal and federal district gun bans so that municipalities can enact more gun control whether or not Congress agrees.Moreover, Newsweek quotes Representative Elizabeth Esty (D-CT-5), who suggests, ""Clinton could appoint new leaders at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who could challenge the interpretation of the Dickey Amendment, which limits gun violence research."" In truth, however, gun violence research is already being conducted, and in 2013, CDC/National Academy of Sciences published observations that undercut many aspects of the gun control movement.Clinton, however, is all-in for gun control; it is one of her consistent campaign promises. She has what Newsweek describes as ""an ambitious gun-control agenda.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

""Now nine out of ten British women terminate when they receive a positive diagnosis.""The result is that only 40,000 people with Down syndrome are left in the UK.The situation could still get worse. In countries where the new diagnosis has been applied across the board, the number of Down syndrome babies aborted has gone up significantly. In Iceland, for instance, 100 percent of pregnant moms with a diagnosis of Down syndrome in the last five years have aborted, and no child with Down syndrome has been born.Phillips finds it especially troubling that doctors and other medical professionals routinely paint a grim picture of life with a Down child, leading many parents to choose to abort their children.In the documentary, one fetal medicine expert tells Phillips: ""I have learned over the years, that for some people, having a baby with Down's is an intolerable event.""""They live for many years, so if we think of it as a burden to society, it is a burden that is going to last for a long time,"" to which Phillips replies that she would never have thought of her son Olly as ""a burden that is going to last for a long time.""""What's so very dreadful to the world about Down syndrome?"" Phillips asks, noting how her own life was improved by the birth of her son, despite what doctors had told her.""I expected tragedy and got comedy,"" Phillips quips, noting that ""a majority of people with a Down syndrome family member are really happy with their lot.""According to the actress, the question comes down to: ""What sort of world do we want to live in and who do we want in it?""""If we're heading for a world where we choose more who gets born, we need to think about what it is that we value,"" she said.This isn't the first time Sally Phillips has waded into the debate on Down syndrome and abortion.During a radio interview last May, Phillips noted the similarities between this sort of selective abortions and eugenics.""If you think of people with Down's syndrome as being a particular race. Then it's utterly unacceptable isn't it?"" she asks.Phillips said that it is important to extend the debate, bringing in the witness of people with first-hand experience.""People with Down's Syndrome have never been included in the debate,"" Phillips said. ""They've never been asked, because of course it's preposterous to ask a person with Down's Syndrome--who tend to really enjoy their lives--whether or not they ought to have a life.""An article appearing in the Washington Post last year made a similar point, wondering aloud how certain selective abortions are still legal.""But while governments (rightly) ban gender selection, selective abortion continues to be encouraged for children with Down syndrome,"" the article stated. ""In the United States and abroad, screenings are a routine part of health-care programs, and the result is the near-elimination of these children.""The controversial BBC documentary has received mixed reviews.The Guardian, for instance, objected to the choice of Phillips as a spokesperson, claiming that the actress lacks impartiality.""When a subject is so close to the presenter's heart that it is indivisible from it, the result is impassioned but not impartial,"" the review stated.One can only suppose that in the reviewer's mind, in making a documentary about apartheid or child abuse, actors and directors should also maintain absolute impartiality.Follow Thomas D.

""It makes me uncomfortable to support a candidate who is potentially in the pocket of big corporations.""Similarly, Tom Eberhardt of Wisconsin said about Clinton, ""I'm not crazy about the fact that she's such an establishment politician.""Sullivan responded to Tanden, ""I am for you working up some ideas. I am into this.""I know we have to get through Nevada and South Carolina, but after that, can we do a big speech, maybe near Congress, on changing the way we do business?

The newspapers, he said, had written: ""It looks like trump could lose New Hampshire."" He won in a ""landslide,"" he recalled.Trump then spoke about heroin and drug addiction, speaking of the impact the stories of New Hampshire residents had on him.He departed from the prepared text on the TelePrompTer as he spoke about those stories -- which he has often mentioned at other stops on the campaign trail, in other states.A man called out: ""Save us!""Trump responded: ""We're gonna save ourselves.""Trump went on to pledge to protect New Hampshire's environment.

Kathleen Healey-Tilton of Salem, New Hampshire, told Breitbart News that she expected Trump to win the state, not only because he is leading in recent polls, but because ""some people will not answer survey questions,"" and because voters in general were fed up with both parties.""I want him to go in there and blow up all the corruption, not just on the Democratic side."" She said she thought Trump's recent push for term limits in Congress was ""awesome.""After Quigley, Former Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) warmed up the audience, entertaining them with a dead-on impression of Bill Clinton endorsing Trump.""If Hillary goes to prison, I'll be free as a bird!"" he laughed.Next was former governor John Sununu, who addressed the Trump rally last week in Manchester just before the FBI's decision to re-open the investigation into Hillary Clinton became known.Sununu recalled that moment, telling the audience that there would not be a ""smoking gun"" in the investigation before the election, but that the news ""ripped the scab"" off the truth that thanks to the Clintons, ""the Democratic Party has been infused with a culture of corruption for the last 25 years.""He said that Trump supporters should reach out to supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on that basis:""Corruption cost Bernie the nomination, and its up to us to tell his supporters they're out of their minds if they vote for Hillary Clinton.""Sununu, a member of the Bush family circle and a prominent surrogate for Mitt Romney in 2012, also explained why he became a Trump supporter after opposing him.""How can you support Donald trump after giving him a hard during the primary? The answer is: Hillary Clinton makes it damned easy.""As some chanted, ""Lock her up,"" one man shouted: ""Execute her."" Sununu interrupted his remarks to rebuke the man, who protested: ""For treason."" Sununu repeated his rebuke, and continued with his speech.Hillary Clinton ""will continue the Obama-inspired slide to socialism,"" Sununu said.Mike, from Sandown, called the election ""the most important in my lifetime."" He said he was hopeful Trump would win, since he had more votes than anyone in the history of the New Hampshire primary.Steve Lewis, of Rochester, said the most important issue for him was the state of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals.""The VA is worse than it's ever been,"" he said.""I get a kick watching people who wanted Obamacare. It's the same as we've been living with ... they don't give a crap if you live or die.""Asked whether he was afraid, as Hillary Clinton says, that Trump would privatize the VA, he said: ""No, that's what we need.""A string of recent polls has Trump tied with, or slightly ahead of, Clinton in the Granite State.The Trump campaign will visit several more states Friday, ahead of a busy travel and campaign weekend.Joel B.

Here it is:SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDo you want to work at Taco Bell? If so, vote for Hillary Clinton. She's your woman!The new jobs report is out and it's another clunker. We added another 425,000 Americans NOT in the workforce.We also found out that multiple jobholders- meaning Americans forced to hold 2 or 3 jobs just to make ends meet- just rose to 8.05 million, the highest of this century.We also found out that between March of 2010 and today, under Obama, our economy has gained 547,000 low-wage bartender and waiter jobs, while losing 36,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs. The economy is a disaster. The GDP for the past 8 years is the worst in the history of America. 94 million working age Americans aren't working. More than 100 million Americans are on welfare checks. More Americans have joined the food stamp rolls under Obama than have joined the job rolls. More businesses close each day than open, for the first time in the history of America.And here's a great one- of the 1 million net jobs created for women in the past decade- all one million went to foreigners. That stat comes from the Labor Department. Don't blame me, or Trump, or ""a vast right wing conspiracy."" That stat is straight from Obama's Labor Dept. And that same Labor Dept. admits they don't keep track of who is legal or illegal. All they know is every net job for women went to ""foreigners.""That means almost every net job in America for women went to illegals for the past decade.Or do you think our country is bursting at the seams with legal foreigners from Austria and Canada and New Zealand? Have you met any foreigners from Iceland? I haven't.So now we know this entire economy is built just for low-wage jobs for illegal aliens. Great news!Now we have the final coup de grace. Taco Bell just announced this morning...in the midst of another awful jobs report...that it is expanding. Taco Bell is the one company hiring. Everyone else is laying off, or standing pat.Even high tech companies in Silicon Valley have announced massive layoffs in recent weeks. Even famous names like Twitter are laying off a large percent of the workforce. No job options there.But good 'ole Taco Bell is ready to hire you. Happy days are here again.College costs $100,000 to $250,000 for four years. Grad school adds another $100,000-plus. And after six or seven years of hard work and an investment of your parent's life savings, and massive debt that you'll never pay back in your lifetime, you're now almost 30 years old and your choices are:Taco Bell, or your parent's basement.Or didn't you know more young adults are living in their parent's basement than at any time since the Great Depression?Or that student loan debt is the highest in history?Or that one third of students aren't making any payments (meaning they are in default)?So you can sit at home, live in a basement, and legally smoke pot in many states, in order to forget how broke you are...Or take a job for minimum wage at Taco Bell.Because it has become painfully clear under the Democrat Party of Obama and Hillary, those are your only choices.That's been my argument for eight long years. The massive tax/massive regulations/massive welfare state/""Obamacare for everyone"" policies of Obama, Hillary and the Democrat Party have created a nation of low wage, minimum wage, no benefit jobs.Yes, Obama has created jobs. They are cleaning toilets, washing dishes, mowing lawns, or slinging burgers.It's an entire economy for illegal aliens with no education or skills. These jobs are so pathetic, you don't even need to know English to take them.So the choice is clear. If you like the choices you have right now...and you want to work at Taco Bell...Vote for Hillary.SIGN UP"

""Take this week's news that Obamacare premiums are set to go up over 20 percent across the country. Yet leadership in Washington is determined to take up the highly controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership in the December lame-duck.""Earlier this week, Obama's U.S. trade representative Michael Froman predicted that Congress likely has the votes to pass the TPP if Congressional leaders were to bring it up for a vote. Additionally, a Clinton campaign email- made public by WikiLeaks- revealed that a Clinton campaign surrogate privately indicated to supporters that Clinton plans to betray labor and union members, and support the TPP if she's elected President.A recent POLITICO Pro-Harvard poll found that among voters who have heard of the multinational trade pact, 63% oppose it and 68% ""think it should not be voted on until the new Congress comes into office after the lame-duck session."" An astounding 85% of Republicans believe that so-called ""free trade"" has lost more U.S. jobs than it has created. Only a vanishing 8% of Republicans think free trade has led to higher wages for American workers.""Why are we pushing this trade agenda over and above the top concerns of the American people during an unaccountable lame-duck session?"" Brat asks. ""If this deal truly benefits the American people, why not pursue it in the broad daylight of regular order?""""Despite its potentially massive impact, the American people aren't being asked for their input on this deal,"" Brat explains. ""We aren't getting an opportunity to examine it under the cold light of day.""""American workers have been dealt a body blow by political elites who agree to deals that keep their wages low, and threaten their very livelihoods. And then the elites, who benefit at the expense of hard-working Americans, have the audacity to call this lopsided setup 'free trade,'"" Brat writes:I have a PhD in economics and I support the theoretical merits of free trade. Free and fair trade occurs when both trading partners gain from trade due to specialization and a broadened, deeper market. Historically, when we had freer markets, trade enriched the world. However, today, truly free markets are hard to find -- in any sector... TPP proponents argue that consumers benefit from trade deals, due to lower prices for goods. That's all very well -- but goods are hard to buy if you do not have a job or if you now have a low-paying, part-time service job. And recent labor force data show very weak labor markets and a marked shift to lower skill, lower paying jobs.Brat said that the American people rightly feel that Republican leadership has not done much to ""fight on their behalf"".I came into office after President Obama's unconstitutional amnesty helped undercut the wages of American workers, and I vividly remember leadership in Washington saying they would fight tooth and nail to overturn this policy.The American people were furious -- and remain so, because they cannot point to much of any fight on their behalf. That is the issue.I hear from small business folks, the people behind 70 percent of our jobs, every day. Their number one concern is not a massive trade deal -- it's Obamacare, which is literally putting them out of business. This huge market distortion takes up 1/6 of our economy and America wants to know: What is Washington going to do to fight for them?...Government interference in healthcare has been a disaster, and businesses are suffering under a constant alphabet soup of regulations, from EPA and FDA rules and the overtime rule and the fiduciary rule and the franchisee rule. All of this constricts our economy and hurts hard-working Americans, who are being sold a false bill of goods under the title ""free market."" They're fed up; and they are right to be furious with the priorities of Washington's elites.Brat said that while he's asked Washington leaders ""whether TPP will help struggling Americans,"" he has yet to receive an answer. He noted that is also ""concerned by chapters that constrict industries, and sections with potential to alter federal law that raise major sovereignty issues.""Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders used their platforms to spread the message that current U.S. policy does not benefit all Americans. Competitive large firms, wealthy cronies with lawyers and lobbyists with seats at the table during negotiations in Washington, D.C., will undoubtedly benefit from a deal like TPP. They all get their special line somewhere in the 5,500 pages of the deal. To get my vote, though, I need to see evidence that these massive trade deals benefit middle class Americans -- those men and women in my district who work hard all day, every day, holding up their part of the bargain.

In fact, we are one of only seven countries in the world that allows abortion on demand after 20 weeks of pregnancy - putting us in the ranks of notorious human rights violators North Korea and China. We are one of the least safe places on earth for babies in the womb.And yet, our laws could still get worse. A lot worse. And soon.It's entirely possible that every single federal or state statute that protects women from being pushed into abortions without informed consent, or parents from abortionists who would perform secret abortions on their daughters, or taxpayers from paying for abortion despite their opposition to it, would be wiped off the books. It really depends on who gets elected.If pro-abortion politicians gain office, they will work to repeal pro-life laws and appoint and/or approve pro-abortion judges who will strike down any law that limits or regulates abortion.How do we know this? The Democratic Platform tells us.It states, ""We will continue to oppose--and seek to overturn--federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman's access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment.""And what constitutes an impediment to abortion access? According to advocates of legal abortion, it's anything that prevents a girl or woman from entering a clinic and receiving an abortion on the spot.The Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton decisions in 1973 made abortion for any reason legal through all nine months of pregnancy. But since that time, states have enacted various laws to try to establish parameters around the boundless, unregulated minefield created by the Court.For instance, according to the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute, 19 states have enacted their own laws protecting children from partial-birth abortion. While the gruesome partial-birth abortion procedure is a federal crime, state laws allow state authorities to prosecute those who would perform an operation that amounts to infanticide.Forty-three states provide some protection for children in later stages of pregnancy, with exceptions for the mother's physical or emotional health, after the child is able to live outside the womb.Thirty-two states protect, with limited exceptions, taxpayers from being forced to pay for Medicaid abortions. Such measures have been shown to save 37 percent of the babies who otherwise would have been aborted had public funding been available.Thirty-seven states let parents know when their daughters are seeking abortions; 25 require abortionists to obtain parental consent for this momentous, life-altering operation while 12 require parental notification.Twenty-seven states provide a waiting period prior to an abortion, usually giving a mother a 24-hour reflection period after she receives information on the abortion procedure and fetal development.Thirty-eight states require by law that only a licensed physician can perform an abortion.All of these laws and more, along with the various federal restrictions on abortion funding, would be gone if the Democratic Party holds sway. What's more, we can expect that Planned Parenthood, which kills over 325,000 babies per year, will receive even more than the over $500 million in taxpayer money that it's already handed.Beyond pro-life laws being eliminated, we could see more pro-abortion laws enacted and upheld.The right of religious non-profit groups (including the ones I lead, like Priests for Life) to exclude abortion-inducing drugs from their employee health insurance coverage would be in jeopardy. The Supreme Court could revoke the First Amendment rights of pro-life sidewalk counselors if it were to overturn the McCullen v. Coakley decision. So-called ""buffer zone"" laws that persecute those who pray for women at abortion clinics could become the norm.We are already seeing pregnancy resource centers being forced to refer women for abortions.The list of potentially horrendous developments is almost endless, but the time to prevent them is short. Next Tuesday is not just Election Day, it's the day you can help determine which direction our abortion laws take. Do not sit home -- lives are depending on what you decide.SIGN UP"

Maggie Hassan with Ayotte at 46 percent and the governor at 44 percent, he said.The poll also asked a series of questions to gauge the mood of the New Hampshire electorate.Fifty-five percent of New Hampshire voters said that Obamacare was not a success and 35 percent said it was a success.Asked: Why do you think FBI Director James Comey chose to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State after the agency recently uncovered thousands of emails on the laptop used by Clinton's closest adviser? Sixty-two percent said Comey found something of significance and 36 percent said Comey was trying to effect the election.Yet, 56 percent of poll participants said the reopening of the investigation into Clinton's handling of the emails had an impact on their vote.Asked:  Should President Obama publicly announce before the election that if Hillary Clinton is elected, he will not pardon her for any crimes prior to the election? Forty-one percent of the respondents said the president should announce that he will not pardon Clinton. Twenty-eight percent said he should not and 32 percent were unsure.Forty-three percent of respondents said Clinton should announce that she would not accept a pardon, while 49 percent said Clinton should pledge not to pardon herself. On the other side, 28 percent said she should not announce that she would not accept a pardon and 26 percent said should not pledge not to pardon herself.The poll was conducted with combination of interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users with results weighted to match a proprietary turnout model.New Hampshire (November 3, 2016) v1 by breitbartnews on ScribdSIGN UP"

William Owens, who is endorsing the Republican candidate as a private citizen, says Trump deserves the chance to prove himself to Christian voters, including those in the black church. He asserts the Democrat Party has offered blacks nothing but failed policies.Owens is planning to hold a press conference about his decision on Monday in the swing state of Nevada.He states:When I was first called to help others, I began an organization called the ""Give Me a Chance Ministry."" Our goal was to provide scholarships, tutoring and mentoring programs to underserved students. One of the keys to that remarkably successful program was the fact that we asked nothing from the university involved other than that they give these students a chance to excel. That is the position that I find myself in today when looking at the best candidate for President. Donald Trump has humbly asked the African American community to give him a chance. After witnessing 50 years of failure from the Democratic Party, compounded by a growing hostility to religion in their platform, I feel that it is definitely time that we give Mr. Trump that chance to prove he can be a great President.Owens, a black minister who marched with Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the civil rights movement, has launched an ad campaign urging black voters to abandon the failed policies of the Democrat Party.In an open letter to black voters, Owens states:It is time we faced the truth. The policies embraced by the Democrats have failed us for decades. They have destroyed our communities, weakened our families, and doomed us to a future of dependency. What's more, the Democrats now take our votes for granted and ignore our voices in favor of other interest groups.""Be honest,"" Owens addresses black voters. ""Can you really say that Hillary Clinton speaks for you? Or understands the African American experience? We're told that we should vote for her because ... well, because blacks have always voted for Democrats.""Owens says he came to the realization that his relationship with the Democrats was ""completely one-sided.""""They ask for everything--support, votes, unquestioning loyalty--and give nothing back,"" he writes. ""If we want to reclaim our power as voters, then African Americans need to demonstrate that we won't allow ourselves to be used.""Owens has been a fierce opponent of abortion and same-sex marriage. The black leader has condemned the narrative created by President Barack Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder that black civil rights is analogous to the agenda to achieve same-sex marriage.""President Obama is a disgrace to the black community,"" Owens told Breitbart News in March of 2015. ""He is rewriting history. We didn't suffer and die for gay marriage. We marched for opportunity, equality, justice, freedom from oppression. We are the true heirs of the civil rights movement.""CAAP has since launched a new initiative called RISE, a grassroots network that seeks to unite ""people of every race, creed, culture, and background,"" to focus on defending faith, family, and justice.Owens cites the issue of Supreme Court appointments as a major factor in his decision to endorse Trump.""The simple truth is that the next President will appoint at least one Supreme Court justice, thereby shaping this country for decades to come,"" he states. ""By promising to nominate only constructionist jurists to the Supreme Court, Donald Trump has demonstrated that people of faith can trust him to defend religious freedom and traditional values.""""On the issue that matters most, Mr. Trump is the only candidate that I could consider voting for,"" Owens concludes.When I was first called to help others, I began an organization called the ""Give Me a Chance Ministry."" Our goal was to provide scholarships, tutoring and mentoring programs to underserved students.

But it might not be the one you're thinking of, as you consider the various slogans you have heard: ""Make America great again,"" ""Repeal and replace Obamacare,"" ""Crooked Hillary.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNo, there is another pitch -- and it is something you hear every single time he speaks, though it is not something he actually says.It is the Rolling Stones song, ""You Can't Always Get What You Want."" It plays at the end of every Trump speech, no matter what the circumstances might be.It was there at the end of his nomination speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, as the ocean of balloons dropped.It was there on Thursday night at The Farm in Selma, North Carolina, as fireworks exploded above an audience of 17,500 supporters.And it has been at almost every campaign stop in between.The song is an odd way to end a big political speech. First of all, it is a ballad, and runs much slower than typical Stones fare. Second, it begins with a choir -- not pounding drums, or screaming guitars.Most politicians prefer to go out with a bang, or at least a beat. But ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" is more a kind of wistful consolation, an intimate word.Yet there is a purpose to the song, and it lies in the lyrics. Not in the verses so much -- though there is a reference to a woman with ""blood-stained hands"" -- but rather in the chorus, which repeats the title of the song:You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You get what you needThat is the subliminal message Trump has been quietly broadcasting into our nation's collective brains over the past several months, and more.And it makes sense, actually.For conservatives, especially the ""#NeverTrump"" faction, Trump is far from the ideal candidate.He is not the second coming of Ronald Reagan. He is not the fulfillment of the constitutionalist restoration that the Tea Party movement imagined, in its heyday. He is a former Democrat who still has big government instincts on several fundamental issues.To liberals, Trump symbolizes everything they tell themselves they are against.He is coarse, and politically incorrect. His policies on immigration and Islam reject the left's multicultural ideal. He has attacked the central tenets of the leftist faith, from climate change to the war on cops. And, of course, he is now a Republican, which means he is, by extension, a racist and a fascist.But the alternative has become intolerable.Hillary Clinton is the first major presidential candidate to be under criminal investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation during an election. That is not the FBI's fault, or anyone else's, except for Hillary Clinton herself. And the fact that the Democratic Party nominated her is a sign that her party is almost incapable of renewal.Clinton also remains responsible for the deaths of four Americans at Benghazi -- as does her boss, President Barack Obama. They have both said that they ""take responsibility,"" which is Washington's way of ducking blame. But the fact is that the decisions they made before Benghazi allowed the attack to happen, and the decisions they made afterwards destroyed public trust.Whoever wins the White House, America is about to face some very serious challenges -- the overdue hangover of the Obama administration, whose negative consequences have been concealed by the media and ignored by the public.Collectively, we wanted to feel good about the fact that we elected Obama, and so we turned away from what he has actually been doing to the country.Starting Wednesday, you will begin to hear about the $20 trillion in debt, the stagnating economy, the calamity that health insurance has become, the imminent entitlement crisis, the growing threat of China and Russia and Iran and terrorism, and more.As we face these problems -- each one, a crisis on its own -- we cannot trust the same people who are responsible for them. Nor can we trust the same policies.We need someone new. And while Trump may not be the ""someone"" many of us imagined, he represents the only possibility of new leadership.There is a relevant lesson here from the Biblical story of Noah, which Jews around the world will read in weekly services this Saturday.The Bible describes Noah as a man who is righteous ""for his generation."" (Genesis 6:9) It is a subtle criticism: Noah was not good in an absolute sense.But in a generation of bad people, he was good enough.When God is fed up with the corruption of the world, it falls to Noah, the best of a rotten lot, to save humanity by building the ark. (A big, beautiful ark.)To some Americans, Trump is exactly what they want. They love him, and he loves them.But Trump's core supporters are a committed minority. For everyone else, there is Noah. Or the Rolling Stones.You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you just might find you get what you need.Cue the fireworks. And the rainbow.Joel B.

For any cop that is aware of this level of wrongdoing, and they have veterans in their family, or deceased veterans in their family, they owe it to them to stand up, to stand and be counted today, and shine the light of truth on this great evil.""""From what I understand, up to the commissioner or at least the chief level in NYPD, they wanted to have a press conference, and DOJ, Washington people, political appointees have been exerting all kinds of undue pressure on them to back down,"" he added. Marlow suggested that some of those involved in keeping the details quiet might want to avoid accusations of politicizing the case and seeking to influence the presidential election.""Sure, that's it. That's the argument for it,"" Prince agreed. ""But the fact is, you know that if the Left had emails pointing to Donald Trump visiting, multiple times, an island with underage sex slaves basically, emails, you know they'd be talking about it. They'd be shouting it from the rooftops."" ""This kind of evil, this kind of true dirt on Hillary Clinton - look, you don't have to make any judgments. Just release the emails,"" he urged. ""Just dump them. Let them out there. Let people see the light of truth.""Prince dismissed the claims of people like Clinton campaign CEO John Podesta and DNC chair Donna Brazile that some of the damaging emails already released by WikiLeaks were fabricated, noting that ""forensic analysis done shows that, indeed, they are not fabricated; they are really legitimate.""""This is stuff coming right off a hard drive that was owned by Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, Hillary's closest adviser for the last 20 years,"" he said of the new bombshells. ""This is not from some hacker or anybody else. This is a laptop seized from a warrant in a criminal investigation.""Prince confirmed that based on his information, Abedin is most likely looking at jail time, unless she cuts a deal with prosecutors.""There's a minimum of obstruction of justice and all kinds of unlawful handling of classified information,"" he said. ""Because remember, this laptop was in the possession of Weiner, who did not have a security clearance. And many, many of those emails were from her Yahoo account, which had State Department emails forwarded to them, so she could easier print these messages, scan them, and send them on to Hillary. That's the carelessness that Hillary and her staff had for the classified information that the intelligence community risks life and limb to collect in challenged, opposed areas around the world.""""That's not who you want in the White House,"" Prince declared."

She says her father is closing the gap and taking the lead in many swing states across the country. ""It's been amazing for me the past 24-hours. I've been in North Carolina, Michigan and now New Hampshire and the spirit and enthusiasm for a Trump presidency is enormous and it's incredibly exciting.""In the past week, Trump has narrowed his opponent's lead in many key battleground states like Virginia and Colorado, according to recent polls. The Republican nominee even took the lead this week in new polls in North Carolina, Florida and New Hampshire.Ivanka Trump noted a statistic that roughly 70 percent of voters believe the country is heading in the wrong direction, and explained that the polls are now reflecting that people see her father as an antidote to that.""It's great we are seeing it now in the polls, but really in a more meaning personal level, I feel it in every community I enter, every highway I drive down where you see the signs,"" she explained, adding:It's a message of change, but really I allow my father to speak for himself...he's had a consistent platform from the beginning of his campaign. He's been an advocate for better trade deals, for putting this country back to work, for school choice and repealing common core and bringing education back to a local level. There's so many things and...his side of the [issues] really resignate with the people.""""The enthusiasm, the passion and the love is so heart felt,"" Ivanka added. ""And the optimism about what this country has the potential to be under the right leadership.""Ivanka and her siblings -- Don Jr., Eric, and Tiffany -- have been campaigning hard for their father with each of them holding a number of events across the country in battleground states this week.She went on to praise her father for his leadership capabilities, saying there are really few great leaders in both business and politics.""I like to share with people who he is as a person, who he was as a father and who he is leader at the Trump Organization,"" Ivanka told Breitbart News, adding that she's learned so much from him both personally and professionally as a role model.It's hard to be a great leader. It's hard to be an inspiring leader. There are a lot of people who manage...but they're not leaders and my father really is a leader. He sets a very bold and a very big vision for what he wants to accomplish and then he puts in place the people who will be able to execute upon that ambitious goal and he helps them a long the way and he often times realizes in people their potential.""He's been a great inspiration in that regards and as a father our family is very close. As a parent now myself...I no longer take for granted that it's easy to be a good parent,"" she noted on a personal level. ""It's tough to be a good parent and to have a connected loving family. He's been an unbelievable father to me and my siblings and I feel very blessed for that and very grateful.""It's a message of change, but really I allow my father to speak for himself...he's had a consistent platform from the beginning of his campaign.

Roe and his partner are working on three Michigan congressional races, a state Supreme Court justice race and two county-wide contests.""I was at a Trump rally in Warren, right down the street from me here Monday-he packed them in and enthusiastic crowds like you've seen everywhere else,"" he said.The former congressional chief of staff said polls done for a client running for Congress in Macomb County had good news for the New York City developer.""In Macomb County, Trump is winning big,"" he said. ""Trump's number are great, they are great. I would say double-digits. If you look at the public that's been put out from Macomb County, every one of them shows Trump with a big lead.""Macomb County is a critical county for Republicans running statewide, he said. ""Most people are comfortable saying that Trump is going to win here-the only question is how big the margin's going to be.""In the battle for the states that turns America into a national chessboard, there was speculation that Trump was making feints into states that were solid for President Barack Obama in 2012, such as Maine or Michigan, in an attempt to draw Clinton away from states he really needed to win.Roe dismisses any talk of Trump making Michigan a diversion tactic.""You know? I personally believe he is doing it because he believes he's got a chance to win this this-across the industrial Midwest,"" he said. ""Look at Pennsylvania, he is making a play for Wisconsin-Trump believes it and I think he is right.""Roe said, ""You don't deploy your top to places you don't think you can win. All the top surrogates and Trump himself are coming here.""In addition to Clinton's rally Friday, her husband President Bill Clinton has been a constant visitor to the state, including his private meeting Wednesday in Detroit with African-American ministers, he said.""They are totally concerned here-as they should be-and across the country that African-American turnout is not what it needs to be for Hillary Clinton,"" he said.""The Democrats are scared to death right now and the Republicans are on offense,"" he said.In the 2012 election cycle, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney told Republicans that he would put Michigan in play, because he grew up in the state, where he father was the governor in the 1960s. But, when the ballots were counted, President Barack Obama beat Romney with 54 percent of the vote to the governor's 45 percent.Roe said despite his promises and his family history in the state, Romney did not contest the state.""You'd think that a guy would make a play for the state where he was born,"" he said.""Romney didn't play for Michigan,"" he said. ""He did not visit Michigan one time post-convention. Ryan came here once in September and that was the only visit that we got."" Rep. Paul Ryan (R.-WI) was Romney's running mate in 2012. ""I don't think Romney spent any money in Michigan.""The big difference between 2012  and 2016 is that Trump is making a solid effort to win a state Romney ignored, he said.Another part of it is that Romney did not resonate with Michigan residents, while Trump is completely in synch with them, Roe said. ""Particularly on trade and secure borders and national security, he is in line with where the people of Michigan in a big way, particularly where I live, Macomb County, the home of the Reagan Democrats, very blue collar and they are embracing Trump hugely here.""SIGN UP"

Saudi and Iranian OPEC delegates also declined official comments.Saudi Arabia has increased output since 2014 to record highs of around 10.5 million-10.7 million barrels per day and adding extra supply would only worsen the global glut, which has already seen prices more than halving from $115 a barrel since mid 2014.The Saudi threat followed objections by Iran, which said it was unwilling to freeze its output, the same OPEC sources said. Iran has argued it should be exempt from such limits as its production recovers after the lifting of EU sanctions.The Saudi threat will revive memories of a pump war that Riyadh embarked on at the end of 2014 to claw market share back from higher-cost producers. Iran along with other OPEC price hawks have severely criticized the Saudi strategy.Riyadh has softened its stance since the appointment of Khalid al-Falih as energy minister in May this year.In September, OPEC agreed at a meeting in Algeria on modest preliminary oil output cuts in the first such deal since 2008, with special conditions given to Libya, Nigeria and Iran, whose output has been hit by wars and sanctions.A new rise in tensions observed during the meeting of experts last week highlights the fragile nature of OPEC agreements. The group has a long way to go before it turns its preliminary Algerian accord into a real deal.The Saudi threat to raise output came as a surprise even to Riyadh's Gulf OPEC allies, sources who attended the meeting of experts on Oct. 28 said.One source said the Saudi OPEC delegation has asked to call off the next day's meeting with non-OPEC producers, including Russia, on Oct. 29 since Iran was objecting to a deal. But they were convinced by other members to attend it in order not to embarrass the group.""We felt as if they (the Saudis) wanted the meeting to fail,"" said a third, non-Iranian OPEC source.""WAR FRONT""The Saudi OPEC delegation told their Iranian counterparts that Tehran should freeze output at 3.66 million bpd - the latest estimates of Iranian output by OPEC experts, known as secondary sources.Iran has reported its output at 3.85 million bpd in September and said it would only cap its output at 12.7 percent of OPEC's total ceiling - or 4.2 million bpd.Iran's counter-argument at the meeting was that Saudi Arabia has raised its output by almost 1 million bpd since 2014, and is now trying to convince others it would cut output by 400,000 bpd to get a deal, though in reality Riyadh has already won extra production and revenue, according to OPEC sources.Iranian comments after meeting to domestic media indicated tensions were high.""Working in oil industry is like operating at war fronts and we have to preserve our trenches by raising our production capacity as much as we can,"" Ali Kardor, managing director of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), told the oil ministry's news agency Shana.""The next OPEC meeting is near and we will never cease to recapture our quota in the organization,"" he said on Monday, adding that Iran's crude oil output was nearing 4 million bpd.OPEC sources have said Saudi Arabia offered to reduce its output from summer peaks of 10.7 million bpd to about 10.2 million if Iran agreed to freeze production at around levels of 3.6 million-3.7 million bpd.The Saturday meeting with non-OPEC producers went ahead though they made no specific commitment.The High Level Committee of experts will meet again in Vienna on Nov. 25 to finalize the details ahead of the next meeting of OPEC ministers on Nov. 30.OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo has said he is ""optimistic"" a final agreement will be reached.An OPEC delegate, who attended Friday's meeting, said he still hoped for a deal in November.""People can look at it from different angles. The fact that discussions are still going on is a positive one. They are going to work on it, close to the ministers' meeting,"" the delegate said.SIGN UP"
