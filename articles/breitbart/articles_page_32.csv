Trump has tied his rival Hillary Rodham Clinton there.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe University of Denver poll, released Wednesday evening, shows Trump and Clinton tied at 39 percent while Libertarian Gary Johnson gets five percent and the Green Party's Dr. Jill Stein gets four percent. The survey, conducted from Oct. 29 to Oct. 31--after the FBI announced it was reopening the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's illicit home-brew email server set up in violation of State Department guidelines--has a margin of error of 4.2 percent.Colorado's nine electoral votes would easily put Trump over the top of the necessary 270 electoral votes if the New York billionaire businessman can hold Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Nevada, and Iowa--all of which he's leading in--and the red states, among other states in which he is surging. Surveys out this week have shown Trump trending upwards into the lead in Virginia and close to Clinton inside the margin of error in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Other states, like Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and New Mexico, have tightened as well--while Maine's second congressional district is moving in Trump's direction.Veteran Colorado pollster Floyd Ciruli, who conducted the poll, told the Denver Post that the results are ""reflective of the fact that this environment has turned negative for Clinton""--specifically in the wake of the fact the FBI has reopened the email investigation. It has also been confirmed the FBI is investigating the Clinton Foundation in recent days.Early voters in Colorado benefit Clinton, according to the poll, per the Denver Post's John Frank.""Among voters who already cast ballots, Clinton sits in a much better position at 45 percent to 38 percent for Trump -- a number that appears to support early voting figures showing Democrats with a 23,000 ballot advantage,"" Frank wrote of the survey. ""But among those who have not yet voted, the numbers flip -- which gives Republicans hope that its voters will close the gap in the final days.""Recent polling out of Colorado shows the state has become a key battleground over the last month, and Clinton's campaign--which originally abandoned Colorado during the summer--has now gone up with six-figure television ad buys in Colorado and elsewhere to try to regain the states they have lost.This survey confirms other polls in recent days, from CBS/YouGov, Remington Research, and Emerson College--each of which showed statistical ties between Trump and Clinton in Colorado. Breitbart News/Gravis Marketing polling from early October was the first to show Colorado tightening again after the party conventions, but then it reopened for Clinton over the course of October, only to close back up again to a tight race in the end.SIGN UP"

Is the insurgency associated with Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders a flash in the pan, or is it something real?SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER1.  Populism: Right, Left--and Together?   The answer to that question, of course, depends on who does the answering.  Most of the Republican establishment, along with the Democratic establishment--which some describe as the ""Uniparty""--would prefer to believe that the populism of Trump and Sanders is temporary, that is, a nightmare from which they will soon awaken.  Meanwhile, the Trumpians and the Sandersistas see themselves as part of a long-term force, even the winning force, within their respective parties.Yet now comes an author with an arresting argument: He believes that the Trump and Sanders groups, currently in different political parties, might yet find themselves fighting on the same side--perhaps even in the same party.Yes, that's the conclusion of veteran journalist John B. Judis, in his new book, The Populist Explosion: How the Great Recession Transformed American and European Politics.  Judis is emphatic that populism--under the banner of Trump, Sanders, or others--is here to stay. Judis himself is an interesting figure.  He is undeniably a man of the left, and yet he is a man of the old left--the left that feels closer to Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and the proletarian consciousness of mid-century America, as opposed to Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the new breed of liberal billionaires. That old left felt genuine affection, even admiration, for the ""horny handed sons of toil""--that is, the blue-collar workers and small farmers who paid the taxes, fought the wars, and generally upheld our society, even as they tried to make it better.  To the old leftists, such working-class concepts as community and solidarity--including labor unions--were not only meaningful, but are worth preserving.   So as we can see, Judis is badly out of step with the new Democratic Party, the party of the Clintons, which is more interested in financialism, multiculturalism, and green Malthusianism, and which sees factory workers, for example, as ""retro"" and ""not progressive"" at best, and as carbon-dioxide-producing beneficiaries of ""white privilege"" at worst.  Indeed, as both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have said (in speeches to fundraisers, where they seem to feel most comfortable and thus most free to speak their minds), the working-and middle class is either to be pitied as ""bitter clingers"" or else scorned as ""deplorable.""  Yet in Judis' book, there is none of that sort of condescending hostility.Instead, Judis examines populism on both the right and the left, with a focus on finding the strengths and unities within both.  And so while Judis favors left-populism, he is sympathetic to much of right-populism.   Indeed, what's most refreshing and persuasive about his book is its ""ecumenicalism""--that is, the author's ability to identify the underlying commonalities of right and left populism.  In his mind, identifying those similarities is the key to building a majoritarian populism--a populism that can win. In his opening, Judis gets right to the point: Populist parties and candidates are on the move in the United States and Europe.  Donald Trump has won the Republican nomination.  Bernie Sanders came in a very strong second to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.  And these candidacies came on the heels of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements.  In Europe, populist parties in France, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland are contending for power or are already part of the government. Indeed, the news is moving so fast--faster than the publisher's deadlines--that were Judis able to update this book with the latest populist developments, he would probably have added Germany, where the Alternative for Germany Party has done well in recent elections, and Iceland, where the Pirate Party (yes, that's really its name) has surged and toppled the incumbent government.  And yet while the history of European populism composes roughly half of Judis' book, we can confine ourselves, here, to the other half, concerning the United States. Judis starts with the basic question: What is populism? ""The logic of populism,"" he answers, is ""the concept of a 'people' arrayed against an elite that refused to grant necessary reforms.""  We can note immediately that such a conception of populism is race-neutral.  In US history, populists have often built trans-racial coalitions, although, sadly, on other occasions, populism has sunk into the dismal swamp of racism.  As Judis also notes, across our history, such regrettable behavior has been thoroughly bipartisan. And yet as the author makes clear, the ultimate point of populism is about economics, not race.  Thus it was that the 1896 Democratic Platform, for example, denounced ""foreign pauper labor."" That is, as the platform language makes clear, the Democrats were against low-wage labor, wherever it might come from.Moreover, the author's focus on economics leads him to zero in on issues that have the potential to unite people of all races.  One such economic issue is hostility to free-trade agreements; as Judis explains, on trade, the elites have gone one way, while the masses have gone the other way:In the United States, both parties' leaders embraced ""free trade"" deals only to discover that much of the public did not support these treaties.Thus already we can see part of the explanation for Trump's sudden rise in 2016: While most of his opponents were embracing an increasingly unpopular pro-trade orthodoxy, Trump, on his way to the nomination, was un-embracing it.  We can add that a similar process took place on the Democratic side: Hillary Clinton probably staved off Sanders only because she flip-flopped on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.   2. The Populism of the 19th Century Next, Judis explores the history of American populism.  Although some might argue that populism goes back to the American Revolution--or at least to the Whiskey Rebellion of 1791-1794, or to the election of Andrew Jackson to the White House in 1828--Judis situates its origins more recently: to the rise of the People's Party in 1891.  Judis chooses the late 19th century as his starting point precisely because he is so focused on the economics of populism.  Indeed, he links the rise of populism to the emerging public demand for a major economic-policy shift--that is, for a new response to new conditions.  And at the end of the 1800s, such big economic shift was happening.  Those years saw the industrialization of much of the country, in particular, the rapid rise of the railroads.  In those days, the railroads were central to the economy; that is, before autos and air, the rails were the only significant form of national transportation.  Yet at the same time, they were a series of local monopolies, barely touched by governmental supervision or regulation.  And as we all know, monopoly power, unchecked by any sort of countervailing force, is a formula for abuse and exploitation.  As Judis explains, ""The rise of the People's Party was the first major salvo against the worldview of laissez-faire capitalism.""  Moreover, the farmers of that era were having a particularly hard time.  In addition to suffering at the hands of the rapacious railroads, farmers were hurting because prices for their crops had been falling since the 1870s, in part because of the federal government's deflationary monetary policies.  Here we can pause to note that deflation might sound nice, insofar as falling prices are nice for consumers, but deflation can be ruinous for producers.  Moreover, because farmers typically had heavy debt as they borrowed to pay for their land and to harvest their crops, many hard-working agriculturalists found themselves slipping into debt peonage.  And yet because of deflation, they had an even harder time paying back their debts, because as the price level fell, they found themselves forced to pay back in ""more expensive"" money.  The result was a wave of bankruptcies and foreclosures across the Farm Belt; in Kansas, for example, the banks ended up owning 45 percent of the land.  The populist policy prescription, therefore, included enough inflation to get the price level back at least to where it had been two decades earlier; their preferred policy lever to raise prices was the additional coinage of silver as a way of getting more money into circulation.  Since the US was already on the gold standard, this proposed addition of silver was known as ""bi-metallism."" Yet the People's Party had other goals, too, on its agenda.  These included railroad regulation, of course, as well as other causes, such as limits on immigration, the direct election of senators, and even an income tax.Amidst this gathering economic and political crisis, the presidential administration of Democrat Grover Cleveland was coldly unsympathetic: As Cleveland's Secretary of Agriculture, Julius Sterling Morton, pronounced, ""The intelligent, practical, and successful farmer needs no aid from the government.  The ignorant, impractical, and indolent farmer deserves none."" By some abstract and austere economic criterion, such a philosophy might make a cruel sort of Darwinian sense, but it was disastrous politics, because farmers have more votes than bureaucrats. In addition, the Cleveland administration, joined by the Republicans of that era, was firmly on the side of the gold standard, and gold only.  Meanwhile, the farmers were organizing--organizing beyond the farm.  As Judis explains, the People's Party (more commonly known as the Populist Party) extended its reach to the cities. That is, the Farmers Alliance, active in the South and West, joined with the Knights of Labor, concentrated in the East and the Great Lakes.  As the Texas Farmers Alliance put it, there is a ""perfect unity of action"" between rural and urban. Thus the Populists agitated against incumbent Republicans in Republican areas, and against incumbent Democrats in Democratic areas. We might pause to observe that such cross-regional cooperation has always been hard to achieve, and just as hard to sustain. And yet as as a matter of electoral mathematics, the various regions needed each other--they could't win if they weren't united.  This same logic, we might add, still applies today.  And this is a point that Judis dwells on: For populism to win, it has to be us against them--and as a matter of numbers, there must be more us than them.  Yet at the same time, this is not a formula for violence or revolution; neither the Populists then, nor Judis today, are revolutionaries.  Instead, it's a formula for political victories.  If there are, in fact, two Americas--the big and the small, rural and urban--then the small need to be able to see their situation clearly, and to explain their situation clearly to others.  That's the essence of peaceful political change through the democratic process.    So yes, in the context of the time, the Populists were demanding a radically different policy agenda.  And yet in important ways, they were conservative.  After all, in the farm areas, they were themselves property owners--albeit barely hanging on to their property.  They were simply men and women who wanted a better deal from the system, not the overthrow of the system.  As Judis observes, ""Except for a few scattered leaders, the populists were not socialists. They wanted to reform rather than abolish capitalism."" Indeed, the head of the Socialist Party back then condemned the Populists as ""bourgeois.""In fact, most Populists saw themselves as hard-working people who were threatened from both above and below.  That is, they felt squeezed from above by predatory plutocrats who finagled the system at their expense, and squeezed from below by itinerant tramps, who would work for lower wages--when they weren't trying to steal.   Moreover, a strong Christian faith animated many Populists; in the rural areas, they were mostly Protestants, and in the urban areas, mostly Catholic.  Yet in both locales, clergymen were often leaders of the movement; they were godly fighters for economic justice for their flocks. In July 1892, the Populists, convening in Omaha, nominated James B. Weaver of Iowa, a former Republican Congressman, as their candidate for president, and James G. Field, the former Democratic Attorney General of Virginia, to be the vice-presidential nominee.  As Ignatius Donnelly, a former Republican Congressman from Minnesota, wrote in the party's platform, ""We seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people.'""So the platform was moderate enough, although sometimes, in the heat of the fight, the Populists' rhetoric grew apocalyptic: In the fiery words of Tom Watson, a former Democratic Congressman from Georgia, ""Never before in the history of the world was there arrayed at the ballot box the continuing forces of democracy and plutocracy.""In November 1892, the Weaver-Field ticket won the electoral votes of five states: Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, and North Dakota.  Meanwhile, Democrat Grover Cleveland won a second term in the White House. Then in 1893 came a severe recession.  And after that, populism took off.  Indeed, the Populists became so powerful that they soon took over the Democratic Party, wresting control from President Cleveland and the Democratic establishment.  At the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, a 36-year-old former two-term Congressman from Nebraska, William Jennings Bryan, delivered a barn-burning address to the delegates, ending with these resonant words: Having behind us the commercial interests and the laboring interests and all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.Those closing words, ""You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold""--that is, Democrats must embrace silver, too--so electrified the convention that Bryan, young as he was, swept to the nomination.  Yet there was still a ceiling on Bryan's popularity: He lost that November to Republican William McKinley. Still, Bryan, dubbed ""The Great Commoner,"" was so popular with Democrats that he received their presidential nomination twice more after 1896--in 1900 and 1908.  And while Bryan never won the White House, he stands as one of the most influential figures of the early 20th century, because he transformed the Democratic Party in a populist direction and thereby influenced the direction of the country.  To be sure, the rival Republicans were dominant back then, and yet the only reason they stayed dominant is that President Theodore Roosevelt, who succeeded McKinley in 1901, adopted many of Bryan's reformist ideas. Meanwhile, the Populist Party soon withered away; in a sense, it was destined to fade because it had fulfilled its mission.  It had taken over one of the two major parties--the Democrats were now the populist party.  As has been said of third parties, they are like bees: They sting once to make their policy point, and then they die. 3. Populism in the 20th Century Three generations later, another Democratic populist, George Wallace of Alabama, found himself in a somewhat similar position to that of Bryan.  That is, he ran for president three times--as a Democratic insurgent in 1964, as a third-partier in 1968, and again as a Democratic insurgent in 1972--until he was shot and grievously injured, forcing him out of the race, So while Wallace never gained the White House, he is nonetheless to be remembered as a transformative figure.  He transformed one of the two major parties--only this time, in the late 20th century, it was the other party, the Republicans, that he changed.  Without a doubt, Wallace was a racist.  He first came to national prominence--make that notoriety--in his 1963 gubernatorial inaugural address in Montgomery, when he roared, ""Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!"" And there was also the provocative way that he pronounced the word ""negro,"" taking it up to the edge of that other ""n"" word.  Judis clearly chronicles, and clearly laments, this defining characteristic of Wallace, as should we all.However, it's also true that Wallace struck a chord with many voters, many of whom were not themselves racist--they were justifiably angry.  The 1960s were, after all, a decade in which the crime rate soared, in which government spending ballooned, in which the big cities burned, and in which it seemed as if the federal government, under Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, was actively siding with the most radical and militant black groups, notably, the Black Panthers.So when Wallace spoke out against government-subsidized Great Society chaos, he found a wide audience.  That is, if the Democrats were no longer interested in--or hostile to--the concerns of ordinary voters, well, the Republicans were interested.  In 1968, Richard Nixon, who had a positive record on civil rights, was elected to the White House on a platform that included ""law and order.""  To be sure, liberal critics jibed that Nixon's phrase was racially coded, but to most Americans, it was simply race-neutral common sense: our cities should not be war-zones.So that was Wallace's major effect: to move Southern Democrats into the Republican Party.Yet at the same time, as Judis details, Wallace was anything but a conservative--he was never, after all a Republican.Indeed, on most issues, fully reflecting his Alabama heritage, he was, in fact, an unapologetic New Dealer; that is, he ran on the traditional lunch-bucket issue of good jobs at good wages.  For example, Wallace extolled the dams built by the New Deal-era Tennessee Valley Authority.  The TVA was revered in the South because it had brought relief from floods and water-borne disease; in addition, the inexpensive hydropower that the dams generated had attracted industry and jobs.  It is this part of Wallace--the economic part--that Judis obviously admires.Meanwhile, Wallace displayed the sort of class-consciousness that one might expect from an old-line Democrat, plus the newer realization that the middle class was carrying too much of the governmental load.  As he said:We're sick and tired of the average citizen being taxed to death while these multibillionaires like the Rockefellers and the Mellons and Carnegies go without paying taxes.Indeed, as Judis notes, Wallace was such a New Dealer that he was even friendly to labor unions--not always a popular position in Right-to-Work Dixie.  In 1967, when asked who he might appoint to his Cabinet if elected president, Wallace mentioned the heads of the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers.So while Wallace was, in many ways, a loyal Democrat till the day he died, he was deeply out of sync with the national Democrats on civil rights.  And amidst the political convulsions over his presidential candidacies, most of his supporters shifted from the Democrats to the Republicans, at least at the national level.  In 1972, President Richard Nixon won a 49-state re-election landslide; probably every living Wallace voter pulled the lever for him. Yet even so, pro-Wallace populists across the country stayed mostly Democratic, at least for a while.  Thus in his quest for the 1972 Democratic nomination, the Alabaman won many Democratic primaries in Southern states, but also won in Maryland and Michigan.  (And then, of course, he was shot and forced to leave the race.) To help explain this ticket-splitting phenomenon, Judis introduces us to another important figure; although a professor, not a politician.  That would be the Michigan sociologist Donald I. Warren, who, in the mid-1970s, studying the blue-collar workers in the Wolverine State and taking note of their suspicion of both parties, coined the phrase ""Middle American Radicals"" (MARs).  These MARs felt alienated from both the Democrats and the Republicans.  That is they, despised contemporary Democrats for their stance on such issues as school busing and gun control, and yet they revered the old Democrats for their emphasis on jobs and Social Security. (No wonder Judis, old-line leftist that he is, feels such sympathy for MARs.)Moreover, like the Populists of the previous century, the MARs felt unfairly squeezed from both above and below--that is, to use the parlance of that era, by ""limousine liberals"" and by ""welfare queens.""  As Warren explained, the MARs believed that ""the rich are giving in to the demands of the poor, and the middle-income people have to pay the bill."" Warren estimated that MARs, nationwide, represented about 25 percent of the electorate.  And so here we can pause to make the same point we made about the Populists: In a pluralistic country, in order to win, a faction must unite with other factions.  Yes, 25 percent is a big number, but it is not the 50.1 percent needed to win an election.  So the MARs needed allies elsewhere in the electorate.  (And to the extent that the MARs are the ancestors of the Trump vote, the same point holds: a movement doesn'tt just need to be big, it needs to be big enough to win. In that same decade of the 1970s, as Judis deftly chronicles, labor unions, long a main pillar of the Democratic Party, were facing new pressure--and getting virtually no help from national Democrats.  Most notably, this new pressure was coming from international competition.  By the 70s, the countries that had been devastated in World War Two had been rebuilt--typically with generous assistance from the US.  And now, those same countries, notably Japan, were burgeoning into significant economic rivals, taking away market share, and thus jobs, from America.  Thus it was that in 1971, the US ran a trade deficit for the first time in the 20th century--and we have had a trade deficit virtually every year since.  Indeed, the cumulative trade deficit over the last 45 years has totaled more than $12 trillion.  And what has the impact of that trade deficit been on US economic growth?  Well, the standard formula for gross domestic product (GDP) is private consumption spending, plus savings, plus government spending, plus (or minus, as the case may be) the balance of trade.  And so we can see that our cumulative trade deficit has subtracted $12 trillion from the US economy since the 70s.  That's a lot of lost jobs.  Yet the policy response to his import-surge was interesting--and not at all what the unions, so loyal for so long to the Democrats, had been hoping for.  As Judis ably describes, the Democrats' response was the new emerging doctrine of ""neoliberalism""--that is, a greater faith in free trade, with little or no concern for the trade deficit.  A synonym for ""neoliberalism,"" perhaps more familiar to Breitbart readers, is ""globalism."" Yet if the American economy, as a whole, was being diminished by chronic trade deficits, different sectors were faring differently--and some were faring quite well.  For example, many multinational corporations were taking advantage of this new neoliberal policy regime by moving their factories overseas to build their wares at lower wages.  This trend accelerated dramatically with the opening of China in the 1980s.And yet American labor, of course, was not mobile.  That is, the factories could go overseas, but the workers couldn't--they were simply left stranded.  Thus began the dolorous slide in domestic manufacturing, and, of course a similar slide in jobs and wages.So it's little wonder that free trade--and its close cousin, open borders for immigration--were popular with owners and unpopular with workers.  This top-down split led to some curious situations, as the leaders outmuscled the led.  Judis recalls attending (as a journalist) a Christian Coalition meeting in the 90s, in which Coalition honchos Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed pushed the organization to endorse the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), even though rank-and-file members were opposed.  As Judis reports, opposition among the plebeians was ""universal."" (The Christian Coalition no longer exists.)  Indeed, national polls from the 90s showed pluralities of Americans opposed to NAFTA and also opposed to most-favored-nation trading status for China.  And yet both of those trade deals, as well as others, sailed through the Republican-controlled Congress, to the delight of a Democratic president.  One might be tempted to say, The Fix Was In.And because of accelerated international trade, domestic American businesses were under yet more intense competitive pressure--they had to cut costs to survive.  Even a kindly or sentimental boss who wanted to keep the company workforce together might soon be booted by money-minded shareholders, dictating decisions from some faraway financial citadel.  Thus in this wave of cost-cutting and union-busting, the whole support system for a middle-class lifestyle for millions came undone.  For example, here's how, in 2001, The New York Times summarized the fate of meatpacking workers: Until 15 or 20 years ago, meatpacking plants in the United States were staffed by highly paid, unionized employees who earned about $18 an hour, adjusted for inflation.  Today, the processing and packing plants are largely staffed by low-paid non-union workers from places like Mexico and Guatemala.  Many of them start at $6 an hour.  Out of such wrenching economic damage, it's easy to see why the ranks of the populist MARs were increasing. The only thing missing was political leadership--and we'll get to that. Yet as Judis details, if the former middle class was losing ground, other sectors and classes were gaining ground. One triumphant sector was Wall Street, which profited enormously as financiers financed all the offshoring and outsourcing to other countries.So even as blue-collar Americans were becoming more Republican, white collars were becoming more neoliberal or globalist, and so, as a consequence, becoming Democratic--that is, Clinton/Obama-style  Democrats.  Indeed, as more Americans made their living from the global economy--or simply felt that they wanted to be ""citizens of the world,"" focused on such issues as human rights or ""climate change""--they felt less and less connected to such ""old"" concepts as citizenship in the United States.So we can see the makings of a new neoliberal/globalist consensus at the top.  Leading Republicans supported it because it served the interests of outsourcing corporations, while leading Democrats supported it because it served their ""one world"" ideology--and oh yes, also because it served the interests of those same outsourcing corporations, which were themselves becoming increasingly Democrat-friendly.  And, of course, both party establishments were backed up by their respective retinues of Beltway courtiers, journalists, and think-tankers. As a result, according to Judis, recent elections--intensely fought as they might have been--were curiously silent about the biggest issue, neoliberal globalism, for the simple reason that the two parties agreed.  As Judis puts it, Electoral battles would almost invariably leave the heights of the neoliberal approach untouched, and focus instead on social policies such as abortion or gun control and on relatively marginal differences over social spending and taxes.  In other words, whichever party won, the same not-too-popular policies of trade and immigration would nevertheless remain in place.  So again, we can see where populism comes in.  Back in the late 19th century, the leaderships of the two major parties were united in their support for the gold standard.  And then, in the late 20th century, both parties were united in their support for globalism.  In both instances, the fuse of populism was lit.Indeed, in the 1990s the populists were on fire.  The year 1992 began with the insurgent candidacy of Pat Buchanan, who sounded William Jennings Bryanesque as he challenged President George H.W. Bush in the Republican presidential primary: As transnational corporations compete ever more ferociously, First World workers become expendable.  . . . What has global competition done for the quality of life of Middle America?  What, after all, is an economy for, if not for its people?   Later that same year came another populist, Ross Perot, who also made opposition to NAFTA a centerpiece of his independent bid. Continuing with his history, Judis next walks us through a discussion of the Tea Party.  The origins of the Tea Party might have been libertarian--mostly, opposition to Obamacare.   And yet more recently, as many Tea Partiers have become Trump-ized, the movement has taken on a new focus: opposition to both oppressive Big Government and globalist Big Business.   And oh yes: Perhaps the hottest single issue of the last decade has been opposition to unlimited immigration and also to Beltway-spawned  ""comprehensive immigration reform.""  And it's that anti-immigration stance, Judis notes, that also animates right-populists all across Europe. 4. Populism in the 21st Century Speaking of prominent populists, now Judis comes to Donald Trump. The author doesn't hide his disdain for the man, describing him as ""bigoted,"" even as he empathizes with his supporters; Judis clearly sees the movement as more important than the man.  (Meanwhile, Trump supporters, of course, will disagree with Judis' characterization of Trump.) Still, Judis carefully assesses the overall arc of Trump's career, observing that populism has always been a part of his persona.  Back in 2000, for example, he dismissed both George W. Bush and Al Gore as ""establishment politicians."" Indeed, as with Wallace, Judis allows that Trump could be a paradigm-shifting figure, whether or not he wins the White House.  As Trump said earlier this year: Five, ten years from now--different party.  You're going to have a workers' party.  A party of people that haven't had a real wage increase in 18 years, that are angry.Here I would be remiss if I didn't add that Judis also devotes considerable attention to the evolution of left-populism, culminating in the 2016 candidacy of Bernie Sanders, to whom Judis is sympathetic.  Yet as he notes, for all of Sanders' talk about ""democratic socialism,"" he isn't really a socialist--at least not any more.  As Sanders has said:To me socialism doesn't mean state ownership of everything by any means.  It means creating a nation and a world, in which all human beings have a decent standard of living.  We might observe that that's the language of a social democrat, as opposed to a socialist.  That is, while Sanders is assuredly on the left,  he's not on the farthest left--he's no collectivist.  For his part, Judis probably more akin the social democrats of Europe--although, again, he is also sympathetic to the right-populism of, for example, Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party.By now we can see that Judis' purpose in writing this book is to envision a future unity between the Trumpian populist right and the Sandersian populist left.  Indeed, some elements of a possible new synthesis are already present: Sanders agrees with Trump on trade, and, in the past at least, before he was shouted down by the open-borders activists, has said hawkish things about immigration.  In any case, Sanders is 75 years old.  The real issue is not what he thinks, but rather what his supporters think.Looking at the Sanders coalition, we can stipulate that the politically correct ""Social Justice Warriors"" are hopeless--that is, hopelessly in love with crazy schemes that Judis, also, doesn't seem to have time for.  Yet at the same time, one can look elsewhere in the Sanders coalition and see potential allies.  That is, the young Starbucks baristas looking for their first real job--the job that will empower them to, say, buy a house.  Meanwhile, pro-Sanders blue-collar workers--the ones who are probably mostly voting for Trump--are  looking to keep their jobs.  So those two latter groups, the baristas and the blue collars--joined by, for example, Uber drivers, and others struggling in the ""gig"" economy-- might be potentially amenable to some sort right-left populist fusion.  And that's the synthesis that Judis hopes to see: the marriage of Sandersism and Trumpism.But will it ever happen?  Beyond the vagaries of this current presidential election, Judis argues that neoliberalism can't survive, and so it will have to be replaced by something else:The circulatory system of trade deficits, recycled dollars, and private and public debt that sustains neoliberalism won't go on forever, and when it does cease, or fray to the point of breaking, there will be a reckoning, for which the Perot,  Buchanan, Sanders, and Trump campaigns will have prepared the way.  But we must ask: The populist insurgencies of recent years have prepared the way for what?  Well, that is the mega-question.  And the short answer is that nobody knows, exactly, how a 21st-century populist will govern.  Yet in the meantime, Judis makes a strong argument that the near future will, in fact, be shaped by populism, not elitism.  Probably a lot of Breitbart readers would agree. 
Populist parties and candidates are on the move in the United States and Europe.  Donald Trump has won the Republican nomination.  Bernie Sanders came in a very strong second to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.  And these candidacies came on the heels of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements.  In Europe, populist parties in France, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland are contending for power or are already part of the government. 

In the United States, both parties' leaders embraced ""free trade"" deals only to discover that much of the public did not support these treaties.

Having behind us the commercial interests and the laboring interests and all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.

We're sick and tired of the average citizen being taxed to death while these multibillionaires like the Rockefellers and the Mellons and Carnegies go without paying taxes.

Until 15 or 20 years ago, meatpacking plants in the United States were staffed by highly paid, unionized employees who earned about $18 an hour, adjusted for inflation.  Today, the processing and packing plants are largely staffed by low-paid non-union workers from places like Mexico and Guatemala.  Many of them start at $6 an hour.  

Electoral battles would almost invariably leave the heights of the neoliberal approach untouched, and focus instead on social policies such as abortion or gun control and on relatively marginal differences over social spending and taxes.  

As transnational corporations compete ever more ferociously, First World workers become expendable.  . . . What has global competition done for the quality of life of Middle America?  What, after all, is an economy for, if not for its people?   

Five, ten years from now--different party.  You're going to have a workers' party.  A party of people that haven't had a real wage increase in 18 years, that are angry.

To me socialism doesn't mean state ownership of everything by any means.  It means creating a nation and a world, in which all human beings have a decent standard of living.  

The circulatory system of trade deficits, recycled dollars, and private and public debt that sustains neoliberalism won't go on forever, and when it does cease, or fray to the point of breaking, there will be a reckoning, for which the Perot,  Buchanan, Sanders, and Trump campaigns will have prepared the way.  
SIGN UPYes, that's the conclusion of veteran journalist John B. Judis, in his new book, The Populist Explosion: How the Great Recession Transformed American and European Politics.  Judis is emphatic that populism--under the banner of Trump, Sanders, or others--is here to stay. The Populist Explosion: How the Great Recession Transformed American and European PoliticsJudis himself is an interesting figure.  He is undeniably a man of the left, and yet he is a man of the old left--the left that feels closer to Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and the proletarian consciousness of mid-century America, as opposed to Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the new breed of liberal billionaires. That old left felt genuine affection, even admiration, for the ""horny handed sons of toil""--that is, the blue-collar workers and small farmers who paid the taxes, fought the wars, and generally upheld our society, even as they tried to make it better.  To the old leftists, such working-class concepts as community and solidarity--including labor unions--were not only meaningful, but are worth preserving.   So as we can see, Judis is badly out of step with the new Democratic Party, the party of the Clintons, which is more interested in financialism, multiculturalism, and green Malthusianism, and which sees factory workers, for example, as ""retro"" and ""not progressive"" at best, and as carbon-dioxide-producing beneficiaries of ""white privilege"" at worst.  the working-and middle class is either to be pitied as ""bitter clingers"" or else scorned as ""deplorable.""  Yet in Judis' book, there is none of that sort of condescending hostility.bitter clingersdeplorableInstead, Judis examines populism on both the right and the left, with a focus on finding the strengths and unities within both.  And so while Judis favors left-populism, he is sympathetic to much of right-populism.   Indeed, what's most refreshing and persuasive about his book is its ""ecumenicalism""--that is, the author's ability to identify the underlying commonalities of right and left populism.  In his mind, identifying those similarities is the key to building a majoritarian populism--a populism that can win. In his opening, Judis gets right to the point: Populist parties and candidates are on the move in the United States and Europe.  Donald Trump has won the Republican nomination.  Bernie Sanders came in a very strong second to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.  And these candidacies came on the heels of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements.  In Europe, populist parties in France, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland are contending for power or are already part of the government. Indeed, the news is moving so fast--faster than the publisher's deadlines--that were Judis able to update this book with the latest populist developments, he would probably have added Germany, where the Alternative for Germany Party has done well in recent elections, and Iceland, where the Pirate Party (yes, that's really its name) has surged and toppled the incumbent government.  And yet while the history of European populism composes roughly half of Judis' book, we can confine ourselves, here, to the other half, concerning the United States. Judis starts with the basic question: What is populism? ""The logic of populism,"" he answers, is ""the concept of a 'people' arrayed against an elite that refused to grant necessary reforms.""  We can note immediately that such a conception of populism is race-neutral.  In US history, populists have often built trans-racial coalitions, although, sadly, on other occasions, populism has sunk into the dismal swamp of racism.  As Judis also notes, across our history, such regrettable behavior has been thoroughly bipartisan. And yet as the author makes clear, the ultimate point of populism is about economics, not race.  Thus it was that the 1896 Democratic Platform, for example, denounced ""foreign pauper labor."" That is, as the platform language makes clear, the Democrats were against low-wage labor, wherever it might come from.Moreover, the author's focus on economics leads him to zero in on issues that have the potential to unite people of all races.  One such economic issue is hostility to free-trade agreements; as Judis explains, on trade, the elites have gone one way, while the masses have gone the other way:In the United States, both parties' leaders embraced ""free trade"" deals only to discover that much of the public did not support these treaties.Thus already we can see part of the explanation for Trump's sudden rise in 2016: While most of his opponents were embracing an increasingly unpopular pro-trade orthodoxy, Trump, on his way to the nomination, was un-embracing it.  We can add that a similar process took place on the Democratic side: Hillary Clinton probably staved off Sanders only because she flip-flopped on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.   2. The Populism of the 19th Century Next, Judis explores the history of American populism.  Although some might argue that populism goes back to the American Revolution--or at least to the Whiskey Rebellion of 1791-1794, or to the election of Andrew Jackson to the White House in 1828--Judis situates its origins more recently: to the rise of the People's Party in 1891.  Judis chooses the late 19th century as his starting point precisely because he is so focused on the economics of populism.  Indeed, he links the rise of populism to the emerging public demand for a major economic-policy shift--that is, for a new response to new conditions.  And at the end of the 1800s, such big economic shift was happening.  Those years saw the industrialization of much of the country, in particular, the rapid rise of the railroads.  In those days, the railroads were central to the economy; that is, before autos and air, the rails were the only significant form of national transportation.  Yet at the same time, they were a series of local monopolies, barely touched by governmental supervision or regulation.  And as we all know, monopoly power, unchecked by any sort of countervailing force, is a formula for abuse and exploitation.  As Judis explains, ""The rise of the People's Party was the first major salvo against the worldview of laissez-faire capitalism.""  Moreover, the farmers of that era were having a particularly hard time.  In addition to suffering at the hands of the rapacious railroads, farmers were hurting because prices for their crops had been falling since the 1870s, in part because of the federal government's deflationary monetary policies.  Here we can pause to note that deflation might sound nice, insofar as falling prices are nice for consumers, but deflation can be ruinous for producers.  Moreover, because farmers typically had heavy debt as they borrowed to pay for their land and to harvest their crops, many hard-working agriculturalists found themselves slipping into debt peonage.  And yet because of deflation, they had an even harder time paying back their debts, because as the price level fell, they found themselves forced to pay back in ""more expensive"" money.  The result was a wave of bankruptcies and foreclosures across the Farm Belt; in Kansas, for example, the banks ended up owning 45 percent of the land.  The populist policy prescription, therefore, included enough inflation to get the price level back at least to where it had been two decades earlier; their preferred policy lever to raise prices was the additional coinage of silver as a way of getting more money into circulation.  Since the US was already on the gold standard, this proposed addition of silver was known as ""bi-metallism."" Yet the People's Party had other goals, too, on its agenda.  These included railroad regulation, of course, as well as other causes, such as limits on immigration, the direct election of senators, and even an income tax.Amidst this gathering economic and political crisis, the presidential administration of Democrat Grover Cleveland was coldly unsympathetic: As Cleveland's Secretary of Agriculture, Julius Sterling Morton, pronounced, ""The intelligent, practical, and successful farmer needs no aid from the government.  The ignorant, impractical, and indolent farmer deserves none."" By some abstract and austere economic criterion, such a philosophy might make a cruel sort of Darwinian sense, but it was disastrous politics, because farmers have more votes than bureaucrats. In addition, the Cleveland administration, joined by the Republicans of that era, was firmly on the side of the gold standard, and gold only.  Meanwhile, the farmers were organizing--organizing beyond the farm.  As Judis explains, the People's Party (more commonly known as the Populist Party) extended its reach to the cities. That is, the Farmers Alliance, active in the South and West, joined with the Knights of Labor, concentrated in the East and the Great Lakes.  As the Texas Farmers Alliance put it, there is a ""perfect unity of action"" between rural and urban. Thus the Populists agitated against incumbent Republicans in Republican areas, and against incumbent Democrats in Democratic areas. We might pause to observe that such cross-regional cooperation has always been hard to achieve, and just as hard to sustain. And yet as as a matter of electoral mathematics, the various regions needed each other--they could't win if they weren't united.  This same logic, we might add, still applies today.  And this is a point that Judis dwells on: For populism to win, it has to be us against them--and as a matter of numbers, there must be more us than them.  Yet at the same time, this is not a formula for violence or revolution; neither the Populists then, nor Judis today, are revolutionaries.  Instead, it's a formula for political victories.  If there are, in fact, two Americas--the big and the small, rural and urban--then the small need to be able to see their situation clearly, and to explain their situation clearly to others.  That's the essence of peaceful political change through the democratic process.    So yes, in the context of the time, the Populists were demanding a radically different policy agenda.  And yet in important ways, they were conservative.  After all, in the farm areas, they were themselves property owners--albeit barely hanging on to their property.  They were simply men and women who wanted a better deal from the system, not the overthrow of the system.  As Judis observes, ""Except for a few scattered leaders, the populists were not socialists. They wanted to reform rather than abolish capitalism."" Indeed, the head of the Socialist Party back then condemned the Populists as ""bourgeois.""In fact, most Populists saw themselves as hard-working people who were threatened from both above and below.  That is, they felt squeezed from above by predatory plutocrats who finagled the system at their expense, and squeezed from below by itinerant tramps, who would work for lower wages--when they weren't trying to steal.   Moreover, a strong Christian faith animated many Populists; in the rural areas, they were mostly Protestants, and in the urban areas, mostly Catholic.  Yet in both locales, clergymen were often leaders of the movement; they were godly fighters for economic justice for their flocks. In July 1892, the Populists, convening in Omaha, nominated James B. Weaver of Iowa, a former Republican Congressman, as their candidate for president, and James G. Field, the former Democratic Attorney General of Virginia, to be the vice-presidential nominee.  As Ignatius Donnelly, a former Republican Congressman from Minnesota, wrote in the party's platform, ""We seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people.'""So the platform was moderate enough, although sometimes, in the heat of the fight, the Populists' rhetoric grew apocalyptic: In the fiery words of Tom Watson, a former Democratic Congressman from Georgia, ""Never before in the history of the world was there arrayed at the ballot box the continuing forces of democracy and plutocracy.""In November 1892, the Weaver-Field ticket won the electoral votes of five states: Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, and North Dakota.  Meanwhile, Democrat Grover Cleveland won a second term in the White House. Then in 1893 came a severe recession.  And after that, populism took off.  Indeed, the Populists became so powerful that they soon took over the Democratic Party, wresting control from President Cleveland and the Democratic establishment.  At the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, a 36-year-old former two-term Congressman from Nebraska, William Jennings Bryan, delivered a barn-burning address to the delegates, ending with these resonant words: Having behind us the commercial interests and the laboring interests and all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.Those closing words, ""You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold""--that is, Democrats must embrace silver, too--so electrified the convention that Bryan, young as he was, swept to the nomination.  Yet there was still a ceiling on Bryan's popularity: He lost that November to Republican William McKinley. Still, Bryan, dubbed ""The Great Commoner,"" was so popular with Democrats that he received their presidential nomination twice more after 1896--in 1900 and 1908.  And while Bryan never won the White House, he stands as one of the most influential figures of the early 20th century, because he transformed the Democratic Party in a populist direction and thereby influenced the direction of the country.  To be sure, the rival Republicans were dominant back then, and yet the only reason they stayed dominant is that President Theodore Roosevelt, who succeeded McKinley in 1901, adopted many of Bryan's reformist ideas. Meanwhile, the Populist Party soon withered away; in a sense, it was destined to fade because it had fulfilled its mission.  It had taken over one of the two major parties--the Democrats were now the populist party.  As has been said of third parties, they are like bees: They sting once to make their policy point, and then they die. 3. Populism in the 20th Century Three generations later, another Democratic populist, George Wallace of Alabama, found himself in a somewhat similar position to that of Bryan.  That is, he ran for president three times--as a Democratic insurgent in 1964, as a third-partier in 1968, and again as a Democratic insurgent in 1972--until he was shot and grievously injured, forcing him out of the race, So while Wallace never gained the White House, he is nonetheless to be remembered as a transformative figure.  He transformed one of the two major parties--only this time, in the late 20th century, it was the other party, the Republicans, that he changed.  Meanwhile, Wallace displayed the sort of class-consciousness that one might expect from an old-line Democrat, plus the newer realization that the middle class was carrying too much of the governmental load.  As he said:We're sick and tired of the average citizen being taxed to death while these multibillionaires like the Rockefellers and the Mellons and Carnegies go without paying taxes.Indeed, as Judis notes, Wallace was such a New Dealer that he was even friendly to labor unions--not always a popular position in Right-to-Work Dixie.  In 1967, when asked who he might appoint to his Cabinet if elected president, Wallace mentioned the heads of the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers.So while Wallace was, in many ways, a loyal Democrat till the day he died, he was deeply out of sync with the national Democrats on civil rights.  And amidst the political convulsions over his presidential candidacies, most of his supporters shifted from the Democrats to the Republicans, at least at the national level.  In 1972, President Richard Nixon won a 49-state re-election landslide; probably every living Wallace voter pulled the lever for him. Yet even so, pro-Wallace populists across the country stayed mostly Democratic, at least for a while.  Thus in his quest for the 1972 Democratic nomination, the Alabaman won many Democratic primaries in Southern states, but also won in Maryland and Michigan.  (And then, of course, he was shot and forced to leave the race.) To help explain this ticket-splitting phenomenon, Judis introduces us to another important figure; although a professor, not a politician.  That would be the Michigan sociologist Donald I. Warren, who, in the mid-1970s, studying the blue-collar workers in the Wolverine State and taking note of their suspicion of both parties, coined the phrase ""Middle American Radicals"" (MARs).  These MARs felt alienated from both the Democrats and the Republicans.  That is they, despised contemporary Democrats for their stance on such issues as school busing and gun control, and yet they revered the old Democrats for their emphasis on jobs and Social Security. (No wonder Judis, old-line leftist that he is, feels such sympathy for MARs.)Moreover, like the Populists of the previous century, the MARs felt unfairly squeezed from both above and below--that is, to use the parlance of that era, by ""limousine liberals"" and by ""welfare queens.""  As Warren explained, the MARs believed that ""the rich are giving in to the demands of the poor, and the middle-income people have to pay the bill."" Warren estimated that MARs, nationwide, represented about 25 percent of the electorate.  And so here we can pause to make the same point we made about the Populists: In a pluralistic country, in order to win, a faction must unite with other factions.  Yes, 25 percent is a big number, but it is not the 50.1 percent needed to win an election.  So the MARs needed allies elsewhere in the electorate.  (And to the extent that the MARs are the ancestors of the Trump vote, the same point holds: a movement doesn'tt just need to be big, it needs to be big enough to win. In that same decade of the 1970s, as Judis deftly chronicles, labor unions, long a main pillar of the Democratic Party, were facing new pressure--and getting virtually no help from national Democrats.  Most notably, this new pressure was coming from international competition.  By the 70s, the countries that had been devastated in World War Two had been rebuilt--typically with generous assistance from the US.  And now, those same countries, notably Japan, were burgeoning into significant economic rivals, taking away market share, and thus jobs, from America.  Thus it was that in 1971, the US ran a trade deficit for the first time in the 20th century--and we have had a trade deficit virtually every year since.  Indeed, the cumulative trade deficit over the last 45 years has totaled more than $12 trillion.  And what has the impact of that trade deficit been on US economic growth?  Well, the standard formula for gross domestic product (GDP) is private consumption spending, plus savings, plus government spending, plus (or minus, as the case may be) the balance of trade.  And so we can see that our cumulative trade deficit has subtracted $12 trillion from the US economy since the 70s.  That's a lot of lost jobs.  Yet the policy response to his import-surge was interesting--and not at all what the unions, so loyal for so long to the Democrats, had been hoping for.  As Judis ably describes, the Democrats' response was the new emerging doctrine of ""neoliberalism""--that is, a greater faith in free trade, with little or no concern for the trade deficit.  A synonym for ""neoliberalism,"" perhaps more familiar to Breitbart readers, is ""globalism."" Yet if the American economy, as a whole, was being diminished by chronic trade deficits, different sectors were faring differently--and some were faring quite well.  For example, many multinational corporations were taking advantage of this new neoliberal policy regime by moving their factories overseas to build their wares at lower wages.  This trend accelerated dramatically with the opening of China in the 1980s.And yet American labor, of course, was not mobile.  That is, the factories could go overseas, but the workers couldn't--they were simply left stranded.  Thus began the dolorous slide in domestic manufacturing, and, of course a similar slide in jobs and wages.So it's little wonder that free trade--and its close cousin, open borders for immigration--were popular with owners and unpopular with workers.  This top-down split led to some curious situations, as the leaders outmuscled the led.  Judis recalls attending (as a journalist) a Christian Coalition meeting in the 90s, in which Coalition honchos Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed pushed the organization to endorse the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), even though rank-and-file members were opposed.  As Judis reports, opposition among the plebeians was ""universal."" (The Christian Coalition no longer exists.)  Indeed, national polls from the 90s showed pluralities of Americans opposed to NAFTA and also opposed to most-favored-nation trading status for China.  And yet both of those trade deals, as well as others, sailed through the Republican-controlled Congress, to the delight of a Democratic president.  One might be tempted to say, The Fix Was In.And because of accelerated international trade, domestic American businesses were under yet more intense competitive pressure--they had to cut costs to survive.  Even a kindly or sentimental boss who wanted to keep the company workforce together might soon be booted by money-minded shareholders, dictating decisions from some faraway financial citadel.  Thus in this wave of cost-cutting and union-busting, the whole support system for a middle-class lifestyle for millions came undone.  For example, here's how, in 2001, The New York Times summarized the fate of meatpacking workers: Until 15 or 20 years ago, meatpacking plants in the United States were staffed by highly paid, unionized employees who earned about $18 an hour, adjusted for inflation.  Today, the processing and packing plants are largely staffed by low-paid non-union workers from places like Mexico and Guatemala.  Many of them start at $6 an hour.  Out of such wrenching economic damage, it's easy to see why the ranks of the populist MARs were increasing. The only thing missing was political leadership--and we'll get to that. Yet as Judis details, if the former middle class was losing ground, other sectors and classes were gaining ground. One triumphant sector was Wall Street, which profited enormously as financiers financed all the offshoring and outsourcing to other countries.So even as blue-collar Americans were becoming more Republican, white collars were becoming more neoliberal or globalist, and so, as a consequence, becoming Democratic--that is, Clinton/Obama-style  Democrats.  Indeed, as more Americans made their living from the global economy--or simply felt that they wanted to be ""citizens of the world,"" focused on such issues as human rights or ""climate change""--they felt less and less connected to such ""old"" concepts as citizenship in the United States.So we can see the makings of a new neoliberal/globalist consensus at the top.  Leading Republicans supported it because it served the interests of outsourcing corporations, while leading Democrats supported it because it served their ""one world"" ideology--and oh yes, also because it served the interests of those same outsourcing corporations, which were themselves becoming increasingly Democrat-friendly.  And, of course, both party establishments were backed up by their respective retinues of Beltway courtiers, journalists, and think-tankers. As a result, according to Judis, recent elections--intensely fought as they might have been--were curiously silent about the biggest issue, neoliberal globalism, for the simple reason that the two parties agreed.  As Judis puts it, Electoral battles would almost invariably leave the heights of the neoliberal approach untouched, and focus instead on social policies such as abortion or gun control and on relatively marginal differences over social spending and taxes.  In other words, whichever party won, the same not-too-popular policies of trade and immigration would nevertheless remain in place.  So again, we can see where populism comes in.  Back in the late 19th century, the leaderships of the two major parties were united in their support for the gold standard.  And then, in the late 20th century, both parties were united in their support for globalism.  In both instances, the fuse of populism was lit.Indeed, in the 1990s the populists were on fire.  The year 1992 began with the insurgent candidacy of Pat Buchanan, who sounded William Jennings Bryanesque as he challenged President George H.W. Bush in the Republican presidential primary: As transnational corporations compete ever more ferociously, First World workers become expendable.  . . . What has global competition done for the quality of life of Middle America?  What, after all, is an economy for, if not for its people?   Later that same year came another populist, Ross Perot, who also made opposition to NAFTA a centerpiece of his independent bid. Continuing with his history, Judis next walks us through a discussion of the Tea Party.  The origins of the Tea Party might have been libertarian--mostly, opposition to Obamacare.   And yet more recently, as many Tea Partiers have become Trump-ized, the movement has taken on a new focus: opposition to both oppressive Big Government and globalist Big Business.   And oh yes: Perhaps the hottest single issue of the last decade has been opposition to unlimited immigration and also to Beltway-spawned  ""comprehensive immigration reform.""  And it's that anti-immigration stance, Judis notes, that also animates right-populists all across Europe. 4. Populism in the 21st Century Speaking of prominent populists, now Judis comes to Donald Trump. The author doesn't hide his disdain for the man, describing him as ""bigoted,"" even as he empathizes with his supporters; Judis clearly sees the movement as more important than the man.  (Meanwhile, Trump supporters, of course, will disagree with Judis' characterization of Trump.) Still, Judis carefully assesses the overall arc of Trump's career, observing that populism has always been a part of his persona.  Back in 2000, for example, he dismissed both George W. Bush and Al Gore as ""establishment politicians."" Indeed, as with Wallace, Judis allows that Trump could be a paradigm-shifting figure, whether or not he wins the White House.  As Trump said earlier this year: Five, ten years from now--different party.  You're going to have a workers' party.  A party of people that haven't had a real wage increase in 18 years, that are angry.Here I would be remiss if I didn't add that Judis also devotes considerable attention to the evolution of left-populism, culminating in the 2016 candidacy of Bernie Sanders, to whom Judis is sympathetic.  Yet as he notes, for all of Sanders' talk about ""democratic socialism,"" he isn't really a socialist--at least not any more.  As Sanders has said:To me socialism doesn't mean state ownership of everything by any means.  It means creating a nation and a world, in which all human beings have a decent standard of living.  We might observe that that's the language of a social democrat, as opposed to a socialist.  That is, while Sanders is assuredly on the left,  he's not on the farthest left--he's no collectivist.  For his part, Judis probably more akin the social democrats of Europe--although, again, he is also sympathetic to the right-populism of, for example, Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party.By now we can see that Judis' purpose in writing this book is to envision a future unity between the Trumpian populist right and the Sandersian populist left.  Indeed, some elements of a possible new synthesis are already present: Sanders agrees with Trump on trade, and, in the past at least, before he was shouted down by the open-borders activists, has said hawkish things about immigration.  In any case, Sanders is 75 years old.  The real issue is not what he thinks, but rather what his supporters think.Looking at the Sanders coalition, we can stipulate that the politically correct ""Social Justice Warriors"" are hopeless--that is, hopelessly in love with crazy schemes that Judis, also, doesn't seem to have time for.  Yet at the same time, one can look elsewhere in the Sanders coalition and see potential allies.  That is, the young Starbucks baristas looking for their first real job--the job that will empower them to, say, buy a house.  Meanwhile, pro-Sanders blue-collar workers--the ones who are probably mostly voting for Trump--are  looking to keep their jobs.  So those two latter groups, the baristas and the blue collars--joined by, for example, Uber drivers, and others struggling in the ""gig"" economy-- might be potentially amenable to some sort right-left populist fusion.  And that's the synthesis that Judis hopes to see: the marriage of Sandersism and Trumpism.But will it ever happen?  Beyond the vagaries of this current presidential election, Judis argues that neoliberalism can't survive, and so it will have to be replaced by something else:The circulatory system of trade deficits, recycled dollars, and private and public debt that sustains neoliberalism won't go on forever, and when it does cease, or fray to the point of breaking, there will be a reckoning, for which the Perot,  Buchanan, Sanders, and Trump campaigns will have prepared the way.  But we must ask: The populist insurgencies of recent years have prepared the way for what?  Well, that is the mega-question.  And the short answer is that nobody knows, exactly, how a 21st-century populist will govern.  Yet in the meantime, Judis makes a strong argument that the near future will, in fact, be shaped by populism, not elitism.  Probably a lot of Breitbart readers would agree. "

He worries that it could torpedo Hillary Clinton's hopes to win the White House.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAppearing on the Tom Joyner Morning Show, Obama urged black Americans to get to the polls.

But the African-American vote, right now, is not as solid as it needs to be,"" he said according to The Hill newspaper.The President went on to scold black voters into going to the polls if they care at all about his legacy.""If you really care about my presidency and what we've accomplished, then you are going to go and vote,"" Obama said. He then told black Americans to urge their friends to vote, too, by telling them Obama ""personally asked you to vote.""""It's not that hard, and I know it's not that hard because we've done it before,"" Obama added.It has been said that Obama owes his 2012 win to an energetic turnout of black voters, including early voters.But on November 1, The New York Times published a story that alarmed many liberals, including, it now appears, President Obama.The ""Old Gray Lady"" worriedly reported that trends in early voting suggest black voters are not very energized for Hillary Clinton and early numbers are way down from 2012.The lower turnout of black Americans is being recorded in Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio among other states according to reports.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

And as he concluded his speech with his signature line, ""Make America great again,"" a pyrotechnic crew behind the stage set off a fireworks display behind the stage, over the Pensacola Bay.In between, he promised to boost military spending, pledging to ""build the 350-ship Navy that our admirals have been asking for, that our country has been asking for."" He also said he wanted new aircraft for the Naval Air Station Pensacola, where the Navy trains many of its pilots.He also promised to support the Blue Angels -- the Navy stunt air team that is based in Pensacola -- saying that they would ""continue to inspire our national will.""Trump also praised the crowd -- which numbered at least 5,000, with more arriving as darkness fell -- and contrasted their warm behavior with that of the Democratic Party operatives who had been sent to incite violence at past rallies.Referring to Robert Creamer -- the political consultant and convicted felon whose firm, Democracy Partners, had organized the disruptions, Trump said: ""He visited the White House, I think, like 344 times, and he was like, 'Yes, but I only saw the president 44 times, and I'm sure that the president doesn't know anything about the violence, right?'""Eight members of the Forsley family, spanning three generations, came to see Trump speak. Asked why she supported Trump, Nicole Forsley, 27, cradling one of her five sons, told Breitbart News: ""'Cause we're not idiots.""Her father, Richard, was more loquacious.""It's a simple decision here: do we want an honest president, or do we want another dishonest president?""The Pensacola stop was the third of four events the Trump campaign had scheduled in Florida for Wednesday and Thursday. Trump addressed rallies in Miami and Orlando earlier in the day, and will speak in Pensacola at noon on Thursday.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBy Tuesday, registered Republicans had cast 208,219 early or absentee votes, while registered Democrats had cast 238,816 votes and independents had cast 114,867 votes. That's almost sixty percent of the 1 million ballots cast in 2012. The registration of the early voters who have cast their ballots so far is 37.1 percent Republican, 42.5 percent Democratic, and 20.4 percent independent.But some Republicans are going to vote Clinton, and some Democrats are going to vote for Trump, and independent votes are going to be split for both candidates. Pollsters working for Investor's Business Daily and the The Washington Post have come up with a poll-tested measure of the splits.The Daily's national poll predicts Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton each keep 87 percent of their partisan supporters in Florida, gain 4 percent or 5 percent from the other party, and lose 8 percent or 9 percent to third-party candidates. According to IBD's estimates, Trump gets 44.2 percent of Nevada's early votes, while Clinton grabs 45 percent of the early votes, and third party candidates are left with 10.6 percent.The Post's estimated splits, however, predict a Trump win, of 46.6 percent to Clinton's 45.7 percent, leaving 7.6 to the third-party candidates. The Post predicts Trump gets 88 percent of Republicans, plus 6 percent of Democrats, plus 51 percent of independents. Clinton gets 87 percent of Democrats, plus 8 percent of Republicans, plus 36 percent of independents. Generally, Democrats need to rack up big wins in the main urban county in the state, Clark County, which includes the city of Las Vegas, to grab the state's 6 electoral votes. In 2012, that county cast 692,262 votes, or roughly 68 percent of the state's ballots.In turn, Trump needs to maximize his expected wins in the rural counties and in the second-largest county, Washoe, which is home to the city of Reno and almost 18 percent of the state's voters.In 2012, the Democrats led in early voting, and the final Democratic advantage in Clark County was 97,000 votes, or roughly 16 percent of the county and city. Gov. Mitt Romney lost the state in 2012 with 47.4 percent of the vote to President Barack Obama's 50.5 percent.The average of surveyed polls at Real Clear Politics show Trump with a 1.4 percent lead over Clinton.

"For every argument the media make against Trump, Hillary's worse.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER(1) Eleven years ago, Trump said on a secretly recorded tape that celebrities can do anything -- even grab a woman's p*ssy.Hillary, born-again Victorian virgin, campaigns with Beyonce, who performs a duet with the words ""curvalicious, p*ssy served delicious.""Hillary is thrilled to have the support of Madonna -- who has publicly offered to give blow jobs to anyone who votes for Hillary. (She'll even remove her teeth!)Hillary's campaign has deployed Miley Cyrus to canvas for her -- when Cyrus is not busy inviting men in the audience to reach up and grab her p*ssy. (Here's a video of delicate flower Miley Cyrus in action.)When Vernon Jordan was asked by CBS' Mike Wallace what he talked about while golfing with Bill Clinton -- aka Hillary's husband -- he answered: ""P*ssy.""Oh, and 11 years before Teddy Kennedy ran for president as the Conscience of the Democratic Party -- he killed a girl. After grabbing her p*ssy.(2) Trump's a sexual predator!Hillary's husband is a well-established rapist, groper and pants-dropper. She's his fixer.Unlike the serial predations of her husband, leveled repeatedly throughout the decades, the timing of these 11th-hour allegations against Trump make them highly suspect.Recall that The New York Times spent months investigating Trump's treatment of women earlier this year. The Newspaper of Record put its best reporters on the job, interviewed a dozen women, and the paper splashed the story on its front page. But the best the Times could come up with was a story about Trump, as a bachelor, publicly praising a model for looking great in a bikini at his pool party. Then they dated. The horror.Five months later, just days before the election, there doesn't seem to be a female Democrat who isn't claiming to have been groped by Trump -- and getting loads of fawning publicity.(3) Trump doesn't give enough to charity.The media only counts ""charitable giving"" if it can be taken as a tax deduction with the IRS. When Trump spent time and money saving a Georgia family farm from foreclosure in the 1980s, for example, he didn't get any tax write-off.Hillary, by contrast, was a big philanthropist because, at about the same time, she was taking a deduction for donations of Bill's used underwear -- the modern equivalent of smallpox-laden blankets. Today, the munificent Clinton Foundation spends less than 10 percent of its revenues on actual charity, using about 90 percent for salaries, offices and travel.(4) Several of Trump's businesses went bankrupt.Trump has created or helped create hundreds of businesses. Fewer than 10 went bankrupt. Hillary had one business, Whitewater Development Corp., and it went bankrupt -- after ripping off scores of ordinary Americans. Also, a dozen prominent Arkansans went to prison in connection with sleazy financial transactions involving Whitewater.(5) Trump University was a scam!Approximately 10,000 graduates of Trump University were thrilled with the program and said so in writing. But a law firm that paid Hillary and Bill Clinton $675,000 for three speeches managed to find a handful of disgruntled students to be the named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against it.Trump University was a minuscule portion of Trump's portfolio. Whitewater was a huge part of Bill and Hillary's get-rich-quick schemes, scamming the elderly, retirees and working-class Americans for the money-hungry Clintons.As described by The Washington Post, people who bought property from the Whitewater Development Corp. were required to submit a down payment, followed by monthly payments, until the entire purchase price of the property was paid off. But if buyers missed a single payment for any reason, the entire transaction would be deemed null and void, and the property, as well as all prior payments, would be forfeited to the Whitewater corporation. No foreclosure proceeding, no court hearing, no due process.More than half of Whitewater's customers lost their entire investment. (See ""Whitewater Repossessions; Sales Practice Benefited Clintons, Partners,"" The Washington Post, April 21, 1994.)Though Hillary had long claimed to have nothing to do with the operation of the business, when the books were finally opened, it turned out that the monthly checks were mailed to the Whitewater Development Corp. -- ""care of Hillary Rodham Clinton."" (See ""Records Show Wider Role for Hillary Clinton; Whitewater Papers Detail Involvement,"" The Washington Post, April 21, 1994.)(6) We can't allow Trump access to nuclear codes!Hillary is the one who is champing at the bit to go to war with Russia, which, I am reliably informed, is a nuclear power.At least Hillary's adept at dealing with sensitive digital information. Huma! Quick! Are the nuclear launch codes on my Blackberry, my desktop thingy or my Facebook page?Compared to Hillary, we'd be safer if the nuclear codes were held by Miley Cyrus (unless she kept them in her p*ssy).(7) Trump's temperament will get us into World War III.Hillary's temperament drove her to push for intervention in the Libyan civil war against Moammar Gadhafi for the sole purpose of giving her a foreign policy success that could be all her own.Obama was skeptical. Libya was Hillary's baby. (Sidney Blumenthal's email to Hillary: ""First, brava! This is a historic moment and you will be credited for realizing it."")After Gadhafi was killed, Hillary's temperament led her to go on TV and laughingly say, ""We came. We saw. He died.""Unfortunately, Hillary hadn't given the slightest thought to what would come next. What came next was: the Muslim Brotherhood, the murder of Americans in Benghazi and millions of refugees pouring into Western Europe.(8) Trump failed to denounce David Duke with the ferocity deemed sufficient by our media.No one even knows if Duke actually exists or is just a phantom produced by the media every four years to smear Republicans.I know that no one has ever been incited to commit murder after listening to a David Duke speech. Lots of people have been murdered by someone who'd just heard an Al Sharpton speech: seven at Freddy's Fashion Mart in Harlem, and one Orthodox Jew, plus one Italian mistaken for a Jew, in Crown Heights.Hillary has not disavowed Sharpton -- nor would our media be so rude as to ask.The mother of Ferguson thug Mike Brown, Lesley McSpadden, campaigns with Hillary -- she even took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. The father of Omar Mateen, the Orlando nightclub shooter, appeared on stage behind Hillary at a rally.If the media won't ask her to ""disavow"" the relatives of criminals and terrorists featured at her events, could they at least ask her if she approves of their parenting techniques?(9) Trump is a ""racist"" because of his plan to remove Muslim jihadists, Mexican drug dealers and rapists from our country.Apart from the fact that ""drug dealer,"" ""rapist"" and ""jihadist"" are not races, we didn't do anything to Muslims or Mexicans, except send them billions of dollars in foreign aid. The only ""racism"" Americans care about is that toward black Americans. We did something to them.Hillary asks blacks to vote for her, then vows to bring in millions of Muslims and Mexicans to take their jobs -- the ones that ""Americans just won't do."" That's racism.(10) Trump ""fat-shamed"" Miss Universe!No, he didn't -- he saved her crown and she was grateful. It's on tape.But more importantly, the Miss Universe in question is Alicia Machado, well-known in Venezuela as a publicity-seeking clown.Machado is credibly accused of: driving the getaway car in an attempted murder; threatening to kill a federal judge; and being the baby mama to drug cartel kingpin Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez, who was on the State Department's ""Most Wanted"" list under -- let's see, checking my notes -- Hillary Clinton.Until 1975, everyone would have realized that it's stupid to bring in single mothers with no marketable job skills, to add to the dependent class. If we did bring them in, politicians wouldn't proudly introduce them at rallies.But Machado is Hillary's model immigrant. Her only job skill is voting. Upside: Hillary gets another vote. Downside: You'll be supporting Machado and her anchor baby for the rest of their lives, America.(11) Trump is challenging the very foundation of our democracy by saying elections are rigged!They are rigged -- ask former Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, whose 2008 election was provably stolen from him when more than a thousand ineligible felons voted for Al Franken in a race Coleman lost by 312 votes. (At least it wasn't an important election: Franken provided the 60th, and deciding, vote to pass Obamacare.)In any event, Hillary says the election is rigged, too -- by the Russkies!The Democrats and the media have gone full John Birch Society on us. There's a fifth column in America -- and their leader is Donald Trump!!!This is a marked departure from their previous cosmopolitan sangfroid about communism. We could have really used this fighting spirit during the Cold War. Instead, we got Jimmy Carter warning Americans about their ""inordinate fear of communism.""Today, bad-ass, eye-rolling journalists are somberly announcing: ""I have in my hand a list -- a list of Donald Trump supporters, who are a conscious, articulate instrument of the Russian conspiracy ...""(12) Trump is shallow, has a microscopic attention span and has not studied political issues deeply.On the other hand, he has a good heart, good judgment and wants the right outcome for America: limits on immigration, fair trade deals, the elimination of Wall Street tax breaks and no more pointless Middle East wars.Hillary doesn't want any of these things. She is good at memorizing all her little facts, but is deeply evil. She wakes up early in the morning to make sure she does the wrong thing for America.(13) Trump has personal baggage.This election is not about Trump. It's never been about Trump. Anyone running on his platform of putting Americans first would be torn to shreds.There are probably lots of bad things Trump's done in his personal life in the past. The ruling class wants Hillary to do bad things to our country in the future.SIGN UP"

Charles Grassley and Gov. Terry Branstad, told Breitbart News the momentum is with Donald J. Trump in Iowa.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERGiuliani said he loved traveling with Trump and spent 110 days with the GOP nominee for president, opening up his rallies, but now they split up to cover more ground in the last two weeks of the election.This is the former mayor's fifth presidential campaign as a leading surrogate and he thinks the crowds and the enthusiasm are greater than anything he has seen in Iowa or any of his other stops. ""The enthusiasm level is way-way-way above what it was in 2012 or 2008, or even in 2004, when President George Bush won.""The New Yorker said while the mood on the campaign is positive, he is deeply disturbed by the uptick in violence against law enforcement, especially after finding out Wednesday morning that two Des Moines police officers were shot dead two miles from his hotel. ""I want to send my condolences and sympathies to the police officers and their families.""The mayor said his group was sleeping during the 1 a.m., ambush, so no one heard the sirens or commotion.Still, for a man who attended so many funerals of police officers and firefighters, it always hits him when he learns an officer has fallen, he said.""I feel a special connection to them,"" he said.Police officers also feel a connection to Giuliani and many times, while traveling, officers pull him aside to share their anxiety about the hostility towards them in the media and from politicians, he said.""There isn't a place I go where a police officer does not come up to me and say they feel like there is a target on their back,"" he said.""They thank me for supporting Donald Trump,"" he said. ""One group told me they think that 95 percent of the police officers in America are going to vote for him.""Giuliani said he did not want to comment on the situation in Des Moines, which is still under investigation, but he did want to say that Trump's Democratic rival Hillary R. Clinton and President Barack Obama have been irresponsible in their feeding of the hostility towards law enforcement.""This year-before this shooting-police shooting deaths by criminals were up 45 percent-45 percent? That's an astounding increase in the number of police officers shot and killed in one year,"" he said.""That 45 percent increase is no doubt in my mind generated by the anti-police hatred that is promulgated by these racial arsonist groups-and not sufficiently disciplined by people like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the people who jump on top of these situations before the facts are in and say: 'The police are wrong. The police are racist.'""The former federal prosecutor said Clinton has been particularly irresponsible in her statements about law enforcement.""Hillary Clinton described the police as being implicitly prejudiced,"" he said. ""Then, she went on to say that we are all implicitly prejudiced-well, you know? I'm not. I don't know about her. Maybe she should look in the mirror and figure out she is saying things like that.""Four of Giuliani's uncles were police officers and he said he was raised to have a special respect for law enforcement. ""I was brought up that the police because they were doing something special. They were putting their lives at risk to protect us.

""The City of Philadelphia has lost more than one-third of its manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization -- another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.""""For the average Rust-belt voter, Trump's sentiment on trade hits home in a personal and powerful way,"" wrote the Washington Post's Chris Cillizza in a piece praising Trump's King of Prussia speech titled, ""Donald Trump gave a very, very good speech today in Pennsylvania"".""It resonates. There's no question about it,"" former Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell has said about how Trump's message is received by Pennsylvania voters.Indeed, as Bernie Sanders' campaign pointed out earlier this year, Pennsylvania has been devastated by Clinton's trade policies:The North American Free Trade Agreement cost 850,000 good-paying jobs in the United States, including 26,300 in Pennsylvania. Normalized trade relations with China which led to the loss of 3.2 million jobs including 122,600 in Pennsylvania. Sanders opposed both agreements while Secretary Clinton supported them.Clinton supported NAFTA, the WTO, and China's entrance into the WTO. Even as recently as the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton defended her husband's globalist trade policies of the 1990s, insisting: ""I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.""When Trump attacked NAFTA and described it as ""the single worst trade deal,"" Clinton defended the trade agreement, declaring, ""Well, that's your opinion.""Sanders' campaign has explained that the result of these trade policies have ""been that Pennsylvania workers lost jobs that went to Mexico, China and other low-wage countries.""Sanders highlighted how Pennsylvania has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs as corporations have shifted production to Mexico in pursuit of cheaper foreign labor.In February, just a few days after Carrier Corporation in Indiana announced the lay-off of 1,400 Indiana workers, ""Cardone, the Philadelphia auto-parts rebuilder which calls itself the city's largest remaining manufacturing company, [announced it] will shift 1,336 workers from its brake caliper plants [in Philadelphia]... to a plant in Matamoros, Mexico,"" Philly.com reported. ""The company, which has been shifting production from Northeast Philly to the lower-wage Texas-Mexico border region for years, told the Pennsylvania Department of Labor last month about the layoff plan.""Since the early 2000s, Cardone's headquarter office in Philadelphia reportedly shrank by roughly 3,000 workers. The report noted that ""the company was moving the brake work to Mexico because the 'entry level' manufacturing work is 'particularly sensitive' to cheap foreign competition.""In 2015, Allegheny Technologies shuttered two steel plants in Pennsylvania, ""laying off 600 workers due to a surge in cheap imports from China,"" Sanders' campaign said.In 2013, General Electric got rid of 950 jobs for Pennsylvania workers from its plant in Eerie, Pennsylvania and shifted the jobs to Mexico, Sanders' campaign similarly noted.In 2011, ""Baldwin Hardware, the internationally renowned maker of high-end brass fixtures that has been based in Reading [Pennsylvania] for more than a half-century, [announced it] no longer will make those products locally and 159 employees will lose their jobs... it plans to close and vacant the plant [in Reading] and transfer most manufacturing to Mexico,"" the Reading Eagle reported.In 2009, Hershey laid off 300 Pennsylvania workers when it moved its York Peppermint Patties Plant from Reading, Pennsylvania to Monterrey, Mexico, ""where workers are paid a fraction of what they were paid in Pennsylvania,"" Sanders campaign highlighted.At the time, ABC reported that Hershey ""is building a 1,500-employee factory in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey to replace plants it closed in the USA and Canada."" The report explained that one of the big reasons for the move is cheaper labor, noting that ""workers in Mexico's processed food industry earn an average of $2.70 an hour"" as opposed to a skilled machinery operator in Hershey, PA who ""earns $19 to $25 an hour.""In 2008, Sony laid off 560 workers when it closed its last television plant in the United States. Sanders' campaign noted that the company moved the plant, which had been located in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, to Baja, Mexico.As President of the Steel Workers Union Leo Gerard has observed, ""in the first decade of this century, America lost 56,190 factories, 15 [factories] a day.""During his June speech addressing the issue of trade, Trump explained that Pennsylvania workers have been ""betray[ed]"" by politicians like Hillary Clinton, who have pursued a policy of globalization that has shipped Pennsylvania jobs to Mexico. Trump said:The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape. But our workers' loyalty was repaid with betrayal. Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization - moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas. Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache. When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians do nothing. For years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment. Many of these areas have still never recovered. Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families... Many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair. This wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class.  It doesn't have to be this way. We can turn it all around - and we can turn it around fast.Trump has warned that if Clinton were elected president, she would continue to expand upon her husband's legacy on trade by approving the Trans-Pacific Partnership.""NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere but certainly ever signed in this country and now you want to approve Trans Pacific Partnership,"" Trump said during the first presidential debate. ""You were totally in favor of it and then you heard how I said how bad it was and if you win, you would approve it and it would be almost as bad as NAFTA.""Clinton played a ""leading part in drafting"" the TPP, according to Bloomberg, and is on record of having praised the agreement at least 45 times, according to CNN.While Clinton now claims to oppose the deal, in a private speech made public by WikiLeaks, Clinton made clear that she believes politicians need to have ""both a public and a private position"" on every issue. During a closed-door speech delivered to Goldman Sachs executives, Clinton declared that her ""dream"" is for a ""hemispheric common market with open trade.""Indeed,  Bill Clinton said that the case for approving the TPP is ""clear"" during a CNBC interview last month. Similarly, Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, recently seemed to leave the door open to the possibility that a Hillary Clinton administration would pass an Asian trade deal similar to the TPP, declaring ""you never close the door"" on passing this type of multi-national trade deal.In 2015 alone, Pennsylvania suffered a net loss of nearly 70,000 jobs due to the U.S. trade deficit with TPP countries, according to the Economic Policy Institute.Clinton's support for globalist trade policies has earned her criticism from both conservatives and liberal progressives alike.Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein has explained how the TPP will be ""NAFTA on steroids"" and will ""enrich wealthy corporations by exporting jobs and pushing down wages."" She and her party have argued that the deal essentially amounts to a ""global corporate coup"" that ""would give corporations more power than nations"" by letting them ""challenge our laws.""Following Sanders' eventual decision to endorse Clinton, Trump made an open appeal to working-class Democrats, whom- Trump argued- Sanders had ""abandoned"" by endorsing ""pro-TPP"" Hillary Clinton.""Bernie Sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton,"" Trump tweeted. ""Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.""""To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first,"" Trump added.The North American Free Trade Agreement cost 850,000 good-paying jobs in the United States, including 26,300 in Pennsylvania. Normalized trade relations with China which led to the loss of 3.2 million jobs including 122,600 in Pennsylvania. Sanders opposed both agreements while Secretary Clinton supported them.The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape. But our workers' loyalty was repaid with betrayal. Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization - moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas.

Clinton lied to Patricia Smith, mother of Sean Smith, at the ceremony Clinton and President Barack Obama staged at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, when the four flag-draped caskets were transferred to the families for burial.Clinton is the most despicable person to ever run for office, except for her husband President William J. ""Bill"" Clinton, and nothing informed his opinion more than the way the former secretary of state treated the families of the Benghazi dead, he said.""This woman stood in front of you at the coffin ceremony-what did she say specifically?"" he asked Smith.""Specifically? I asked her what happened: 'Just tell me what happened, tell me why my son is dead,' she told told me it was the fault of a video. I said, 'What video?' I had no knowledge of a video,"" Smith said.""Over my son's coffin-she told me-she lied to me-everyone knows it was not the fault of the video,"" she said.Schilling said when Clinton was confronted about her lying to the Benghazi families at the Andrews ceremony, she ""basically lied"" and said it never happened.""Not basically,"" Smith said. ""She went on the air and said one of us is lying and it wasn't her.""In the attacks on Benghazi there were two facilities; one was the diplomatic compound that had been established as a makeshift consulate and the other was a CIA facility, where roughly 30 analysts and operatives functioned less than one-mile away. In the first of at least four attacks, two on each site, Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and Smith, who was a State Department computer and communications specialist traveling with the ambassador, were killed, when the house they were holed up in was set ablaze by attackers using diesel fuel. Both men were lost in the thick black smoke from the burning fuel as a diplomatic security agent was guiding them to the roof.In the fourth attack and the second on the CIA annex, former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were killed by a single mortar round that landed between them.Although internally the federal government knew that the Benghazi attacks were carried out by local militiamen, in the first week after the attacks, the government put forward the narrative that they were a spontaneous reaction to a YouTube video that portrayed the Prophet Mohammad in a negative light.Smith told Schilling maybe it would be a good idea to give Clinton a donation in exchange for telling her the truth.""I am sure there was a reason, but nobody knows it except her,"" she said.Listen to Whatever It Takes weekdays from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., online at Breitbart.com.Watch Patricia Smith at the 2016 Republican National Convention:Call into the show: (877) 240-1776SIGN UP"

Yet Clinton has indicated that if she were elected president, she would expand Muslim migration by admitting an additional 65,000 Syrian refugees during the course of a single fiscal year. Clinton has made no indication that she would limit her proposed Syrian refugee program to one year.Adding Clinton's 65,000 Syrian refugees to the approximately 149,000 Muslim migrants the U.S. resettled on green cards in the course of one year means that Clinton could permanently resettle roughly 214,000 Muslim migrants in her first year as president. If Clinton were to continue her Syrian refugee program throughout her presidency, she could potentially resettle roughly 1.7 million Muslim migrants during her first two terms.These projections suggest that after seven years of a Hillary Clinton presidency, the U.S. could have a Muslim population that is larger than France's current Muslim population of 4.7 million.These projections are rough estimates, and the population size could be impacted by additional various factors-- including births, deaths, and conversions.Hillary Clinton's support for open borders is shared by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.Ryan has championed policies to expand Muslim migration into the United States. Last year, Ryan voted to increase Muslim migration and fund visas for nearly 300,000 (permanent and temporary) Muslim migrants in a single year.While polling data shows that his constituents overwhelmingly back proposals to temporarily pause Muslim migration, Ryan has also repeatedly ruled out the possibility of making any cuts to Muslim migration-- insisting that ""that's not who we are,"" and that such a proposal is ""not reflective of our principles.""Neither Ryan nor Clinton have explained how importing hundreds of thousands of migrants that come from nations which may hold sentiments that are anti-women, anti-gay, anti-religious tolerance, and anti-America, benefits the United States or helps to protect our Western liberal values.Many have warned if the U.S. continues at its current record pace of Muslim migration--or if pro-Islamic migration politicians, such as Ryan and Clinton, further increase Muslim migration--the U.S. risks following in Europe's footsteps.As Sen. Jeff Sessions has previously explained, ""It's an unpleasant, but unavoidable fact that bringing in large unassimilated flows of migrants from the Muslim world creates the conditions possible for radicalisation and extremism to take hold, just like they're seeing in Europe.""France's struggle to curb the spread of Islamic extremism has been well documented. As Time has reported:Some 1,800 people left France to join ISIS and other militant groups in Iraq and Syria as of May 2015, according to the Soufan Group, a security firm based in New York, citing estimates from the French authorities... Jihadist groups find fertile ground for recruitment in France and Belgium due to those states' staunch secularism ""coupled with a sense of marginalization among immigrant communities, especially those from North Africa,"" according to the report from the Soufan Group.Almost precisely one year ago, the Paris terror attacks killed 130 people and injured more than 360 others in what was the deadliest day of attacks on French soil since World War II. Last month, the Telegraph reported that ""the majority of the ISIL extremist who carried out the November 13 Paris attacks entered Europe... [and] slipped through Hungary's borders while posing as migrants.""Similarly this summer, 84 people were killed and hundreds were injured in Nice when a Tunisian native mowed down civilians with a 19-ton truck as the civilians were watching a fireworks display to celebrate Bastille Day.Multiple reports have also documented a rise in anti-Semitism throughout France, which has pushed French Jews to ""flee"" in record numbers.As USA Today reported in September:""The number of French Jews immigrating to Israel rose from 1,900 in 2011 to nearly 8,000 last year, said Jacques Canet, president of La Victoire, the great synagogue of Paris. He said the country's 500,000 to 600,000 French Jews -- the third largest Jewish population in the world -- ""feel threatened.""""Increasingly, Jews in Paris, Marseilles, Toulouse, Sarcelles feel they can't safely wear a kippah (yarmulke, or skull cap) outside their homes or send their children to public schools, where Muslim children bully Jewish children,"" Canet said.A poll by the French Institute of Public Opinion in January showed 43% of France's Jewish Community are considering a move to Israel, and 51% said they have ""been threatened"" because they are Jewish.Under current federal policy, Pew projects that the number of Muslims in America will outnumber Jews by 2040- however, as projections based on DHS data have suggested, under a President Hillary Clinton, that date could likely come much sooner.Some 1,800 people left France to join ISIS and other militant groups in Iraq and Syria as of May 2015, according to the Soufan Group, a security firm based in New York, citing estimates from the French authorities... Jihadist groups find fertile ground for recruitment in France and Belgium due to those states' staunch secularism ""coupled with a sense of marginalization among immigrant communities, especially those from North Africa,"" according to the report from the Soufan Group.""The number of French Jews immigrating to Israel rose from 1,900 in 2011 to nearly 8,000 last year, said Jacques Canet, president of La Victoire, the great synagogue of Paris.

Rat droppings were also common.Once CPS decided to remove the children from the ""abuse and neglect,"" upon further examination of the children, CPS workers found marks, cuts, and bruises on the children's arms.On New Year's Eve in 2015, the six-year-old boy told CPS workers that his parents gave him and his sisters what he called ""feel good medicine"" injected with a needle.""He and his sisters usually go to sleep after getting the medicine,"" the boy told a CPS worker, according to court documents.Officials drug-tested the children and found heroin in the systems of the boy's two younger siblings.When CPS officials questioned McIver about whether he injected the children, he said that ""the babysitter may be responsible.""Ten months later, prosecutors pressed charges on the couple when they took McIver and Hutt into custody in September.Hutt and McIver are being held on $100,000 bond each, according to Pierce County Corrections booking records.Hutt has a court date scheduled for December 20, while McIver has a court date set for February 16, 2017.The judge also issued a restraining order that prohibited both parents from contacting their children or being within 1,000 feet of their residences, schools, or future places of employment, citing a ""serious and imminent threat"" to the children.All three children are in foster care.SIGN UP"

The survey of 802 Virginians, taken from Oct. 26 through Oct. 30--meaning it was conducted both before and after the FBI announced its reopening of the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's illicit home brew email server--found Trump at 44 percent and Clinton at 41 percent.A release from the University notes that Trump had already started closing the gap in Virginia before FBI director James Comey's announcement, in his letter to Congress, but that Clinton was ahead by a small margin then. It was after the FBI announcement that the bottom dropped out of Clinton's campaign in Virginia, boosting Trump way over her.""The HU Center for Public Policy poll was conducted October 26-30, 2016, and at the start of the poll, Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had a two point lead prior to the release of the email news story breaking on Friday, October 28th,"" Hampton University's CPP said in the release:After the FBI email news story, the numbers changed dramatically, and following the five day tally, Clinton now trails Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by three percentage points. It must be noted that this poll began on the evening of Wednesday, October 26th and in the two days of data collection before the FBI email news story, the majority of interviews were completed. In that time, the data reflected a slim lead for Clinton over Trump (43% to 42% with 15% undecided). In the three days of data collection after the news, 257 interviews were conducted which reflected a wider Trump lead over Clinton of 48% to 39% with 13% as yet undecided. After all of the numbers from the 5 day poll were added, averaged and weighted, the total puts Trump ahead.Overall, this is a 15-point swing away from Clinton towards Trump from the most recent previous Hampton University CPP poll conducted back in late September and early October, where Clinton was up 12 points.A Trump aide told Breitbart News this week that it seems like Virginia is definitely in play. This individual highlighted previous election cycles -- Ken Cuccinelli's run for governor and Ed Gillespie's run for Senate -- where polls underestimated Republican candidates in both cycles.Now that Trump has pulled into the lead in Virginia, a five-alarm fire alarm is surely going off in Clinton's campaign headquarters in Brooklyn. In fact, before this poll came back, Clinton's campaign changed up the candidate's schedule to deploy her to Michigan--another state that has gone blue in the last several presidential elections but seems to be trending towards Trump--and announced new six-figure ad buys in many blue-leaning states, including Virginia.If Trump locks down Virginia's 13 electoral votes, Clinton's firewall for the White House is significantly diminished, and he is well on his way to becoming the next president of the United States. Trump has already now pulled ahead in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Nevada, Iowa, and more. Winning those, plus the red states and Virginia, would ensure Trump the White House with a comfortable win well above 270 electoral votes and many more states like Michigan, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Maine's second congressional district, Colorado, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and more still in play on the chessboard.The fact that Virginia is back in contention this late in the game, after Clinton previously thought she had it locked in, is particularly embarrassing for her running mate. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), who once served as the state's governor. Kaine has been a lackluster vice presidential candidate who, after a poor showing in the vice presidential debate against Mike Pence in Virginia, has canceled rallies after generating embarrassing headlines with his small crowd sizes.Other recent surveys have also shown Virginia tightening, and it is ultimately unclear exactly what will happen on election day. But if past is prologue--looking back in recent years at the polling in both the Cuccinelli and Gillespie races versus the actual results--then this contest is coming down to the wire between Trump and Clinton in the Old Dominion.After the FBI email news story, the numbers changed dramatically, and following the five day tally, Clinton now trails Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by three percentage points. It must be noted that this poll began on the evening of Wednesday, October 26th and in the two days of data collection before the FBI email news story, the majority of interviews were completed.

""I really mean that. For the country's sake, to be honest with you. But in this case, four years ago, we produced a course that's still available online called MuslimBrotherhoodInAmerica.com. And Hillary's right-hand woman, Huma Abedin, featured prominently in it as an example - just one example, but as an example of Islamist influence operations inside the United States government."" ""I made that contention on the grounds that Huma Abedin, at that time, was known to have essentially her entire family involved in what was a Muslim Brotherhood front group called the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs,"" he explained. ""And the question occurred to me - and, in due course, to several members of Congress, led by Congresswoman Michele Bachmann - that hey, wait, maybe if you have somebody that's got that kind of personal investment in Islamic supremacism, it might have something to do with the fact that the State Department (and the Obama administration, more generally, but specifically the department in whom Huma Abedin then worked as a deputy chief of staff to Hillary Clinton) was aligning its policies so dramatically with the dictates of the Brotherhood, on a whole host of issues.""Gaffney provided some examples of those issues: ""You know, letting in Tariq Ramadan, something Hillary Clinton personally did. One of the, you know, sort of capo de capos of the Muslim Brotherhood, the grandson of its founder. Engaging the Brotherhood and suppressing freedom of speech. Helping overthrow friends of ours, such as they were, in the Middle East in favor of Muslim Brotherhood regimes or jihadist groups of other stripes. And on and on.

And we now know, thanks to WikiLeaks explorations of John Podesta's emails, that John Podesta and the Clinton team took credit for setting John McCain up to that,"" Gaffney revealed. ""And the real message here - and why I feel regretful about this vindication, such as it is - is poor Michele Bachmann, who simply was doing her job in Congress, suffered the consequences of it.

We are asking for your immediate assistance in this effort as the need for facilities continues to grow,"" the email continued.On June 2, 2014, the Obama administration released a Presidential Memorandum, Response to the Influx of Unaccompanied Alien Children Across the Southwest Border, ""for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies,"" which stated, ""The influx of unaccompanied alien children (UAC) across the southwest border of the United States has resulted in an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated Federal response"":Accordingly, I have directed the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to establish an interagency Unified Coordination Group to ensure unity of effort across the executive branch in responding to the humanitarian aspects of this situation, consistent with the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 (Management of Domestic Incidents)(HSPD-5), including coordination with State, local, and other nonfederal entities.The Secretary shall establish and manage this Unified Coordination Group. . . The Secretary has advised me that he will direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Administrator), subject to the oversight, direction, and guidance of the Secretary, to serve as the Federal Coordinating Official who shall lead and coordinate the Unified Coordination Group consistent with the functions of the Administrator . . . As the Federal Coordinating Official, the Administrator (or his designee) shall lead and coordinate Federal response efforts to ensure that Federal agency authorities and the resources granted to the departments and agencies under Federal law (including personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, and managerial, technical, and advisory services) are unified in providing humanitarian relief to the affected children, including housing, care, medical treatment, and transportation.Though the June 2014 Presidential directive references ""the influx of unaccompanied alien children (UAC),"" Swartz's October 26 email uses a different term to refer to the children: simply ""unaccompanied children (UC)."" Swartz dropped the word ""alien"" from her email.On a conference call Monday to identify new properties for ORR's use through this Facilities Task Force on Monday, Swartz, who was an executive with the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, one of the largest and most politically powerful voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) in the refugee resettlement industry, prior to joining ORR, began with a long roll call of more than thirty cooperating departments and agencies, some of whom were not present but for whom Swartz offered an update.The roll call included the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, the Department of Treasury, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Agriculture, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Energy, the Department of Interior the Veterans Administration, the GSA (General Services Administration), the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Management and Budget, and the National Security Council.Neither ORR's Swartz nor any of the bureaucrats representing more than two dozen departments and agencies who participated used the words ""unaccompanied illegal alien children,"" ""unaccompanied children,"" ""unaccompanied minors,"" or ""illegal aliens"" on the conference call, even though the purpose of the call was to provide the intergovernmental ""Facilities Task Force"" headed up by ORR (under the direction of FEMA) with a list of federal facilities which can be used on an emergency basis to house the flood of ""unaccompanied alien children"" who have entered the country illegally.Only two agencies-the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-offered new properties for ORR's use to house unaccompanied illegal alien minors.FEMA offered an unused facility in South Carolina.A representative of NOAA said the agency had identified a property on Monday morning it owns in Colorado that has ""12 acres, 3,000 square feet, and boat access"" that is also ""near the Denver airport.""One representative from NIH suggested using Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia, where the Boy Scouts of America held eight consecutive quadrennial national Scout jamborees between 1981 and 2010, to temporarily house the influx of unaccompanied alien children.But a representative from the Department of Defense quickly discouraged that suggestion, noting that Ft. A.P. Hill is used as a temporary FEMA staging facility when not in use for the Boy Scout Jamboree.Two additional conference calls will be held later this week.On Wednesday, the call will focus on older properties previously considered as inappropriate.Swartz told the participants on the call that the deadline to complete the Facilities Task Force report was this Friday.The June 2014 Presidential Memorandum directs ""All Federal departments and agencies . . . to provide their full and prompt cooperation, resources, and support, as appropriate and consistent with their own responsibilities for addressing this situation, and shall cooperate with the Secretary and the Federal Coordinating Official to ensure a unified Federal response. The Secretary shall lead the coordination of the Federal response to this urgent humanitarian situation and other departments and agencies supporting this effort shall provide support to address this situation as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law.""Notably, the memorandum ""does not obligate any agency to reimburse another agency for the resources used to address the UAC humanitarian situation nor does it limit the use of the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535), as appropriate.""In other words, the funds to provide these emergency housing services to unaccompanied alien children (UAC) come out of appropriations of the agencies that are required to cooperate, not the appropriations of ORR or FEMA.As Breitbart News reported recently, ""A record number of illegal aliens have crossed the U.S.- Mexico border and are in U.S. Border Patrol custody in Texas' Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV), according to the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC).""Earlier this month, Breitbart News reported:A report from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson reveals the number of illegal border crossing apprehensions of Family Units from Central America and Mexico hit the highest level on record.

Honestly. for instance, a great story given out to the media they'll make it look as bad as possible - as bad possible.Trump remarks led the crowd to break out into a chant of ""CNN sucks,"" to which Trump responded by pointing out the dismal earnings figures for The New York Times.""So sad - parenthetically and very sadly, earnings for The New York times are down 97 percent this year they just announced. I feel so badly for them. Ninety-seven percent, oh they're doing great. And they tell you who to vote for -- who to vote for, they want crooked Hillary. This isn't about me. It is about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again and talking about it all over the world.""Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorSIGN UP"

The country faces a possible constitutional crisis should Hillary win the election. With a federal criminal investigation of the possible president-elect underway, President Obama might well issue a preemptive presidential pardon on his way out the door. Imagine that. Pardoned before inaugurated. Or she will find a way to pardon herself for ""the good of the country."" It will simply never end.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIf the past portends the future, we should ponder that which came before. The tale of four partners of the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas is a good place to start. They came to Washington, DC with Bill Clinton in 1993. You couldn't turn a corner in the West Wing without bumping into one or all of them. Webster Hubbell became Associate Attorney General of the United States. He ended up in a federal pen. Vince Foster became Deputy Counsel to the President and he was found dead by gunshot in Fort Marcy Park. Bill Kennedy became an Associate White House Counsel and was neck deep in Filegate and Travelgate. He also oversaw the ubiquitous Craig Livingstone, the former bar bouncer personally chosen by the First Lady to head the Office of White House Security. Together, Bill Kennedy and Craig Livingstone were the ones to officially identify the body of Vince Foster. I knew them all. Of the four partners, only one is left standing. She is currently running for president of the United States.I am struck by the ""none so blind as those who will not see"" syndrome. The Clintons live and breathe and count on those who choose to ignore that which they already know to be true. It has worked for over thirty years and it is working now. She is under federal investigation and blames the investigators. It is reminiscent of her evisceration of Ken Starr, the Independent Counsel appointed by Bill Clinton's Attorney General who ultimately became the scapegoat for virtually all their momentous scandals. It worked then and it may work now.Hillary's incessant scandals over decades have morphed into an odd sort of national vaccination, immunizing her from accountability while hypnotizing much of the nation. In the face of pervasive corruption, it has been reduced to so much white noise. With much of the country asleep at the wheel, she is days away from likely becoming our 45th President. The colossal Clinton con will have achieved riches, greatness and immortality and that is unthinkable to those of us who knew them both.Few noticed when we learned that Bill Clinton accepted a million-dollar birthday gift from Qatar, a major Islamic state and world terrorism sponsor. Or the countless other questionable mega donations from sketchy countries. Or the backroom deals guaranteeing him personally many millions of dollars over time from dubious sources. It's all emblematic of the Clintons' unbridled quest for power and vast wealth. At any cost. That few care is the power of the Clintons in a nutshell. It's just a peek at the thick thread of self-enrichment artfully woven through everything they do and it is one that will become more obvious over time.The Clintons have become enormously enriched through their own unique form of philanthropy. Money is their very own personal Holy Grail. For sale to the highest bidder, they care little about the source and much more about the cash. When questions of impropriety arise, they simply mop up the brief political fallout and move on ""for the good of the country."" And we allow them to do so. It is why, as the election nears, those of us who know how deeply corrupt the Clintons are can only shake our heads in despair.These Masters of the Universe parading as elder statesmen are painfully close to retaking the White House. The People's House.And speaking of that venerated house, one of the more enduring symbols of our democracy: It is an alternative universe when the Clintons can claim the moral high ground on virtually anything. So, the mesmerizing inscription carved into the mantle of the fireplace in the State Dining Room takes on new significance. The words are from a letter John Adams wrote to his wife Abigail in 1800: ""I pray to heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this house, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men rule under this roof."" Over two hundred years later, this prayer now seems uncannily prophetic. As the nation prepares to place an individual so absolutely corrupt in a position of such absolute power, these words should give us all pause.Behind closed doors, it was not just the constant vulgarity, the obscenities, or the alarming denigration of vast groups of their own supporters. It was not just the Hillary scandals from Filegate to Travelgate, to Whitewater and Vince Foster, to massive illegal campaign contributions, to the selling of anything that wasn't nailed down. It wasn't even their unbridled greed or their politics of personal destruction. That was where any perceived enemy or opponent found themselves treated to a uniquely chilling kind of Clinton retaliation. All courtesy of her bona fide secret police. That was just part of it.Equally egregious was her vocal disdain for vast groups of people of faith and her utter contempt for the members of all the armed services. There were too many examples to cite, but my introduction to Hillary occurred in the Oval Office corridor as she headed back upstairs to her own West Wing office. An army officer dressed in Class A uniform had made the mistake of being seen in her presence. Her loud, ""Get these f-king uniforms the f-k out of my sight!"" floored just about everyone.Over time the staggering profanity coming from both Bill and Hillary became expected. As the wife of an army officer for twenty years with a career at the Department of Defense spanning that long, this particular outburst offended me the most. The language coming from a First Lady was deplorable enough, but it was the harsh sentiment that was stunning. This from one who believes she is fit to be Commander-in-Chief. In any case, that was only part of it.It was also the smoke and mirrors that meant virtually everything they said publicly bore no resemblance to what was said privately. She and her closest aides share a contempt for most of the electorate. This has been true since I knew them in the first Clinton administration. Her pathological secrecy arose from a need to conceal not only this but also the money trail. The country has had a glimpse through leaked information of the person behind the mask. The Oscar worthy public candidate who appears quite fit to be president bears no resemblance to the actual person seeking the job. Hillary Clinton is incapable of telling the truth. The truth would not get her elected. In the face of years of documented corruption, that she is on the brink of becoming President defies any logic at all.This past year highlighted the Hillary I know in action. The private server. The classified emails on the unprotected server. The destruction of laptops and phones with a hammer. The actual risk to our national security and the lives of many, all for personal gain. Many involved with this server holding not a whisper of a security clearance. The bizarre immunity deals granted to just about everyone in her periphery when a grand jury had not even been impaneled. The manipulation and the destruction of the emails while under a congressional subpoena. The secret tarmac meeting between the Attorney General and Bill Clinton just before the FBI's curiously tortured findings were unveiled.Then came a charade of enormous proportion. The startling split-screen image of FBI Director Comey, flanked by flags and the power of his office, announcing his peculiar non-indictment indictment alongside arguably the most powerful symbol of the presidency, Air Force One. So, as Director Comey circuitously announced his conclusion, Air Force One sat in all its iconic glory waiting to whisk the president and his president-in-waiting off to a campaign event. Pure political theater. And a not so subliminal message signaling not only the strength and might of the presidency but also their defiant solidarity. It flaunted their triumph over those who had believed justice might actually be served. This symbolic joint jaunt to a Hillary campaign event on this particular day would never have been allowed to occur had there been any doubt of the outcome. He knew. She knew. They knew. That this is not chilling to much of the nation is the most chilling of all.Hillary spent a year firmly assuring the country that nothing would come from of the FBI investigation. During this active and ongoing investigation, she spoke with confidence and conviction. She answered in the affirmative when asked by a television host whether she thinks there is ""zero chance"" she would be indicted.  ""Absolutely. That's what I'm saying. That happens to be the truth,"" Clinton said. This authority came from a knowledge only she had. In the end, a cabal of political players ostensibly working for 370 million people served just one. This is corruption. Half the country is ok with it.I believe the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play was the sole reason for having a private server in the first place. A ""mistake"" is a mismatched pair of socks. Make no mistake, the server was no ""mistake."" The server was the ""intent."" That it was discovered at all was the goof. Hillary risked it all solely to shield from public view that which was most important to her. The sensational amounts of money pouring into the foundation and her involvement in all of it had to be hidden from view. The server was her personal guarantee that none of this would ever see the light of day. Nothing was more important. Nothing will ever be more important.In the wake of all of this, thanks to the president, his Justice Department and a helpful FBI director, Hillary suffered no consequences. There was no accountability for deeds that would have had monumental and life changing consequences for virtually anyone else. These are acts punishable by law and include the real possibility of prison. We will see as more is leaked that the behemoth that is the Clinton Foundation dwarfs even the White House, and the Clintons will protect it at all costs. It represents serious cash, one which has taken in over two billion dollars since it began. It served as their calling card for multi-million dollar speeches, earning the two of them in excess of $230 million since they left the White House. Primarily for selling the promise of access and favor. But the pattern began many years ago.Compared to today, the Hillary Clinton I knew dealt in small potato corruption. She thinks bigger these days. It was unsurprising to me when they exited the White House years ago the very same way they entered, mired in scandal and corruption. And consumed by money.Few remember the looting of the White House, but it was a fitting end to their scandal plagued reign. Hillary exited the White House with furnishings that had already been designated official White House property. When caught red handed, they begrudgingly returned just some of it, admitting no culpability of course, but saying the return was in an abundance of caution. This garnered short lived attention in the press. I could only shake my head as I recalled her graphic objection to protocol concerning official gifts from around the world. In her uniquely expletive-deleted way, the First Lady made her position known to anyone within shouting distance. What she ultimately did with, as she said in my presense, ""our f-king sh-t not the f-king country's f-king sh-t,"" is beyond me.But as Hillary was loading the moving trucks and making history while doing it, she was busy on another front. That was when she distinguished herself as the only First Lady in history to actively solicit high ticket ""gifts"" from her legion of wealthy mega donors on her way out the door. Of the many luxurious gifts this not so blushing bride asked for and received, most remarkable was the modest cigar humidor from of all people, Walter Kaye.He is best remembered as the wealthy donor who had the dubious distinction of placing a young girl named Monica Lewinsky as an intern in the White House years before. Not the most extravagant donation but the tasteless cigar commemoration was meaningful nonetheless.The Bonnie and Clyde of politics never miss a payday and it didn't start with the foundation. They had years of peddling access and influence and it paid well. They discovered their own personal gravy train as they blurred the lines between public service and public opportunism. A loss in this election would mean the end of the Clinton foundation. There would literally be nothing left to sell.As we face the real possibility of an unprecedented pardon should Hillary win the election, it reminds us of how little was made of Bill Clinton's own pardon business during his last days in office. And a gainful business it was. It was textbook Clinton. In fact, it was a real family affair with his shady brother and even shadier brother-in-law in on the lucrative action. These two shifty characters generally flew below the radar but they were an embarrassing presence in the Clinton White House and their hands were always in the till. They are found in other questionable but highly lucrative activities as they gleefully traded on their powerful siblings. These siblings condoned it all privately but condemned some of it publicly when these things surfaced.By now we've forgotten the most infamous pardon of them all. That was bestowed on Marc Rich, the notorious perpetrator of the greatest tax fraud against the United States in history. Among other things. As a permanent resident on the FBI's Most Wanted List, fugitive from justice Rich was probably the least likely person on the planet one might expect to receive a presidential pardon. Unless you knew the Clintons. So, let's review. Denise Rich paid close to half a million dollars to the Clinton Library.She paid at least $70,000 to Hillary's senate campaign and even donated $10,000 to Bill Clinton's Legal Defense Fund as he futilely fought the Paula Jones lawsuit. And that is all we know about. All in a day's work for the Clintons. Few paid attention. Sure, short lived outrage ensued, but our Pravda-esque media ensured the pardon coverage was brief. Most importantly, the Clintons' paydays were never in any jeopardy.There are potential whistleblowers today in the State Department, the Justice Department, and the FBI. They know they have an obligation to expose corruption at the highest levels of our government. They are aware they could expose not only Hillary Clinton but also those she has corrupted in her wake. Their silence is testimony to the real fear of Clinton retaliation. That this may sound melodramatic or suggestive of the KGB of old does not make it less true. Few dare cross the Clintons and those who do are never completely whole again. And this is happening not in Venezuela, but in America.In the end, unethical behavior hung over the Clintons like a noxious cloud, permeating their reign from day one. The scandals were of their own making, each borne of an arrogance, an inordinate greed, and a deep-seated contempt for the rule of law. It continues today. It is what we have to look forward to in a second Clinton presidency. God help us.To many who knew the Clintons behind closed doors, it is unimaginable that she may be elected to the highest office in the land. There is a good chance she will actually become the most powerful person on the planet. John Adams must be spinning in his grave at the mere thought. One thing is true: Many have tried to hold them accountable. All have been thwarted at every turn.It would be easier to catch a cloud than to stop the Clintons. It should scare us all. In the end, it is impossible to make people pay attention to that which they refuse to see. The Clinton con works. Spectacularly. And as with any good con, the hapless mark is left holding the bag. That would be us. With the election mere days away, those who know the Clintons are left with the feeble hope that divine intervention will miraculously lift the electorate's blinders in time.SIGN UP"

communications that include words of express advocacy or the functional equivalent of express
advocacy or that republish campaign materials. However, the plain language of FEC regulations
suggest that a campaign may collaborate with a Super PAC on communications that lack express
advocacy or its functional equivalent, do not republish campaign materials, and air more than 120
days before the primary in each state.1 We believe that such collaboration is legally permissible.Under this theory, the campaign could collaborate on television ads sponsored by Priorities USA
Action more than 120 days before the primary in each state, as long as the ads lacked express
advocacy, its functional equivalent, or republished campaign materials. The advertisements
would focus on a public policy issue; praise your position on the issue or criticize an opponent's;
and urge viewers to take an action in support of your position (or in opposition to your
opponent's). The advertisements would not focus on your qualifications or fitness for office, and
would not refer to elections, candidacies, political parties, or voting by the general public.
Finally, while your campaign may have significant input on such a communications program,
Priorities ultimately would have to direct and control it.While we believe that such a program is legally permissible, it would be breaking new ground -
more so than what CTR is doing. As evidenced by the press scrutiny of CTR's announcement,
the media reaction to such a program could be toxic. In 2011, the FEC divided 3-to-3 on a
request by American Crossroads to engage in a similar coordinated issue advocacy program; that
division between the commissioners has persisted over the past four years. The FEC cannot find
a violation without the support of four commissioners, so the ongoing deadlock reduces (though
by no means eliminates) the likelihood of adverse action by the FEC. However, the Department
of Justice and both houses of Congress retain separate authority to investigate alleged campaign
finance violations, and there is no indication of what their views are on this issue.It would appear they may have been willing to bend current campaign laws to the point of risking a court test to determine whether or not they may actually be breaking them.Yesterday, The Intercept website reported that Neera Tanden, President of the Center for American Progress had expressed concerns in May over the campaign's coordination with at least one Super PAC: ""That's fine. But skirting if not violating law doesn't help her INMHO"".More via The Intercept:But as a recently released email chain shows, even Tanden was concerned in May last year that plans of a pro-Clinton Super PAC to directly coordinate with the campaign were ""shady"" and ""skirting if not violating [the] law.This is a developing story.Madame Secretary,SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER
