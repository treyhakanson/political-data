In doing so, I wish to assure President-elect Trump that a strong and viable Assyrian Christian community in the Middle East will be a stalwart friend and steadfast ally of the United States.All the Christian leaders who spoke to Breitbart News congratulated Mr. Trump for being elected president of the United States on November 8.'Property of Islamic State - Christian home' tagged on a wall in Iraqi Christian town of Bartella. Photo: HudsonSyriac Catholic Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem Joseph III Younan told Breitbart News he is optimistic Mr. Trump will secure a safe future for Christianity in its historical cradle, the Middle East.He said:The Christians and other minorities in Iraq and Syria have suffered catastrophic genocide, persecution, abuse and killings. I witnessed with my own eyes the destruction taking place in our communities. It is no longer acceptable nor permissible to close one's eyes to the atrocities that are being allowed in the 21st century. We hope that American politicians can echo this message throughout the country and speak about this injustice. The Christians in Iraq and Syria are hopeful President-elect Trump and his incoming administration will help secure peace throughout the region for all people and for the sake of humanity.To the ire of his critics, President-elect Trump made a campaign promise to be a defender of Christians across the world.""The Christians are being treated horribly because we have nobody to represent the Christians,"" he told Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in May 2015, referring to the deterioration of the Christian religion in the Middle East. ""Believe me, if I run and I win, I will be the greatest representative of the Christians they've had in a long time.""'We defeated crusaders [Christians] and Rawafid [Shiite] with God's greatness' tagged on a wall in Iraq. Photo: HudsonHe told Breitbart News:We are looking forward to Mr. Trump fulfilling his promises in supporting and strengthening the existence of small ethnic and religious components that faced genocide by terrorist ISIS. The Chaldean Syriac Assyrian people voted massively in favor of Trump for those promises that we wait to be fulfilled in near future. Breitbart News recently reported that the Iraqi Christian militias have reached an agreement to unify their armed groups to seize and secure the Nineveh Plain, their historical homeland in northern Iraq's Nineveh province, which fell into the hands of ISIS in 2014.Youkhana, one of the Christian militia leaders who signed the agreement, told Breitbart News:Today, the Assyrian Christian community in the Middle East is under siege and threatened with annihilation. But we are confident that, with the support of the United States and other allies, we can create a strong community that will be a bastion of liberty and democracy in the region. It is our fervent hope that President-elect Trump will recognize the potential benefit to America, and to the world, of supporting the establishment of a strong Assyrian policy in the Middle East and that, upon taking office, he will take the steps necessary to fulfill that potential.Although the U.S. has acknowledged, in large part due to due efforts by Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE), that Christians and other religious minorities are facing genocide at the hands of ISIS, the number of Muslim refugee admissions has outpaced admissions of Christian refugees.'There will be no crusaders [Christians] here with God's permission.

Washington Controls the Money’	"SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERStephen K. Bannon (or, for those who want to maximize their SEO, Steve Bannon) -- president-elect Donald Trump's pick for White House chief strategist -- made his pet issues known long before joining Trump's insurgent presidential campaign. Now, Americans can reflect on what issues Bannon may take on within a Trump White House -- and it does not look good for the culture of corruption in Washington, DC.In January 2013, Bannon appeared on Fox News' Hannity with Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer for a special called ""Boomtown."" This report, covered extensively in Breitbart at the time, shines a light on his view of what is wrong with our nation's capital. At the time, Bannon was Executive Chairman of both Breitbart News and GAI.Bannon and Schweizer argued that the ""permanent political class"" in Washington ""extracts"" power from the rest of the country so they can make money without producing actual goods. ""There is a business model there,"" Schweizer says of DC.Some key quotes from Bannon's own words show that he, a former Wall Street banker, sees the problem as Washington controlling the money, ""not that money controls Washington"":The rest of the country is in a financial and economic crisis. Much of the country is almost in a depression. And, yet, you have Washington with the three richest counties bordering it seven out of top 10, the big number, per capita income is now higher than Silicon Valley. The great technology engine in the United States....And this is a bipartisan problem, this is not just beat down on Democrats although they have the party of big government. This is a permanent -- class that has now kind of formed an aristocracy. And that aristocracy, that's why nothing changes in Washington, that's why you have these budget debates. And like you said, you're talking about cuts and growth rates of budgets, not cut in the budgets. It's not a downside.It's not that money controls Washington. Washington controls the money. They have an industrial logic to this business model just like any other business model. And that is to extract power from the rest of the country in money into centralized location which is Washington.With Bannon's painting of a bulls-eye on bipartisan corruption and politicians' self-enrichment, it is easy to see why establishment media is slinging so much mud at him right now.The rest of the country is in a financial and economic crisis. Much of the country is almost in a depression. And, yet, you have Washington with the three richest counties bordering it seven out of top 10, the big number, per capita income is now higher than Silicon Valley. The great technology engine in the United States.

""It's what I said, I think, June 16th, when I wrote the first article about Donald Trump, right after he gave his speech at Trump Tower, and he came down, and he announced that he was running. Everyone else thought it was, you know, either a joke or ridiculous or whatever that was - except a bunch of us. This is a battle for the soul of America, Alex - as you can see, even in terms of what's happening now in the media, the attacks on Steve Bannon.""Davi said it was ""powerful and wonderful"" to see Donald Trump's presidency fulfilling Andrew's ""what's happened, what the Democrats have done, they've gerrymandered the whole election process by breaking us down into special interests, unweaving the tapestry of E Pluribus Unum into this kind of separatist thing,"" he said, tweaking the Democrats for their current obsession with gerrymandering as an alleged Republican tool for rigging elections.""And then education, starting with Bill Ayers,"" Davi continued. ""The whole dictum of Bill Ayers in the sixties was bringing down every institution, meaning law enforcement. They were blowing them up at the time. Now what they're doing is, they blew them up from inside.""""The subversive infiltration that our youth has had is astounding. I've got five kids out there, Alex. I've seen how education has been indoctrinated over the last several decades. My twins that are 15 now, they go to private Catholic school, but still when they go to public school - my one son went to public school for a couple of years - it was astounding to me the indoctrination that they were receiving,"" he said. ""We will lose this country. This was it. This was our shot,"" Davi warned. ""Now, I believe we have to attack education, not only the media again and expose them for what they are. I'm in Toronto right now because I have to do a concert Friday night, and they don't have Fox at this hotel. They had just CNN. And I'm gonna tell you, I'm watching that news network - if I just had CNN, if I didn't have Fox, you'd be so drugged into a kind of absolute brainwash, that they do one after another after another. Even their pundits that they have, to take the opposing side, are nice people, but their positioning, or the way that they combat the other announcers, is very weak."" ""So we're having exactly what Andrew had said. We're seeing that come to fruition now. It's been exposed over the years. This is what we have to battle for,"" he said.Davi's travels gave him reason to worry about America's standing in the world and hope that Trump might be able to restore it.""I was in Turkey just a couple of weeks ago. I gave a concert there for their Academy Awards,"" he recalled. ""They had a lot of American stars there. I was sitting at lunch, and they knew; they were hip. They knew that I was for Donald Trump. And a lot of these reporters were talking to me about it. Then they secretly said, 'You know, we like Trump a lot; we're for him, too.' And they wrote a story that just came out two days ago in Turkey, three days ago, that was very favorable. But the odd part about it all is when Erdogan, when Turkey had the coup attempt, Trump has property there. People that worked on that property told me what a great guy he was."" ""This happened to me everywhere I traveled, in Germany and different places: Italy, Estonia, Latvia, Sweden, Budapest. The worldview that Hollywood gives of how certain other countries perceive America is so biased. They're not getting the real story,"" he said.In a recent column for Breitbart News, Davi discussed how Donald Trump can ""revive Reagan's informed American patriotism."" Marlow asked him to define that brand of patriotism and how America can get back to it.""The final speech that Reagan gave America, when he left the White House, and the final point he wanted to make, was that he was worried that the new American patriotism that his administration, his eight years had engendered, and the feeling of that - in other words, all these Trump rallies, this America First feeling, for the first time we've had that in, I don't know how many years, we've had a feeling that America can come back,"" Davi said. ""That feeling is what Ronald Reagan left the country with,"" he explained. ""He said that he was worried that through education, are we doing enough in education around the dinner table, in our public discourse, in our culture? Will we continue to do enough to not be besieged by an American amnesia? Because we've been indoctrinated. The kids have been confused. Again I go back to, just look at the news on CNN, or MSNBC. It takes part of history, distorts it, and then lobotomizes or removes the other aspect that would balance it out. It's almost like what radical Islam does. It's another form of radical Islam, what the Left does, in a politicized way. It's just the gutting out of a nation,"" he contended.""So how do we get back to that? Donald Trump has already started to do that. It's amazing what the movement has done and what Breitbart has been doing over the years. That's been an informed patriotism. Absolutely that.

It's because these kids at an early age have been taught and have been indoctrinated. I call it the feminization of America. It's not just a gender thing. It's not just a male-female thing. I mean, the strength of America has been taken away because of this lack of American exceptionalism, that they just want to talk about warts and all.""Davi recalled an eighth-grade orientation speech he attended with his daughter a decade ago at a ""good private school,"" in which a teacher made it sound as if the focus of the ""warts and all"" American history curriculum would be on the warts, and the teacher was very much looking forward to dwelling on them.""I couldn't hold myself back any longer,"" he recalled. ""I said, 'Excuse me, when you say you're going to look at America from all angles, and then warts and all, it's like you prefaced that as if that was going to be the main thing.' I says, 'America is an exceptional nation.' This is now eight or nine years ago with my daughter in school. And he said, 'Well, well, well, what I meant was, we're gonna take a look at this and that and the other thing.' I can't tell you how many parents came up to me and said quietly, 'Thank you for speaking up because that got us concerned.'""""That's what they're doing in our education,"" Davi warned. ""It's ... concerted - make no mistake about it. It's absolutely just the same thing they're doing in media. Van Jones and these guys that are coming on these CNN shows with such a bias. They should have a tattoo on their foreheads, so this way, when someone speaks, we can see where they're really coming from.""Davi stressed that American culture was in need of repair, along with the education system: ""Back in the day, you had TV that had family values. There was family values. Now we have the deconstruction of family values in popular culture. That's what's hip and easy. So they deconstruct family values, over and over again, and people are confused.""Davi said many in Hollywood are not taking the election results well, citing Robert DeNiro's outburst that Trump's victory made him ""feel like I did after 9/11,"" and Bryan Cranston's heated reaction to Election Day (although Cranston has reportedly changed his stance and now wishes Trump ""success"" at ""unifying our wounded country"").""And Bill Maher - I mean, look at this absurdity, look at this absolute absurdity. I did not agree at all with President Obama when he was elected. I did not agree philosophically, but I respectfully disagreed. I wrote about it on Breitbart. I wrote about it at the Hill. I met President Obama. I said, 'God bless you, Mr. President.' There was not one bit of vitriol or wanting to see him fail. I didn't want to see him fail. These guys are calling for subversive action against our President-elect of the United States,"" he said incredulously. ""They misread him since Day One, which was astounding,"" Davi said of Hollywood. ""And now, they're attacking Steve Bannon. Now, they've got to find something to attack. It is such a cesspit. It's a cesspit that needs to be flushed in some way because they've been indoctrinated. There is something so infecting, and what I think it is, Alex, they're pure globalists, you see.""He noted that Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin has purchased six major Hollywood studios, accelerating a globalist trend that benefits top Hollywood talent and financiers, but leaves the many lower-level people involved in film production out in the cold. ""He just bought Dick Clark productions. He already owns a lot of it. They're building an $8 billion studio in China. Now, that's all good for Bryan Cranston, and de Niro, and myself. They can hire me for a film, and I can fly there. But what about the key grips? What about them? What about the makeup artists? What about the transportation guys? What about the set builders? What about the dry cleaners, and the restaurateurs?"" Davi asked. ""There are two big exports America had: wheat, and American entertainment, besides the car industry,"" he observed. ""So they're globalists, you see? And all the studio heads and the directors, all the above-the-line guys, can go anywhere. They're needed. They don't give a red rat's ass about the American worker."" He said the Republicans were clearly becoming the party of the forgotten American worker, in what he described as an ""amazing shift.""""What Donald Trump has done is, he has just extended this whole Republican party. He's rejuvenated the Republican Party. He's given it a rebirth. Believe it,"" said Davi. ""I left the Republican Party. I became an independent, more than several years ago, because of the frustration. I had gone on Hannity many years ago, saying that both the Left and the Right have failed America. I wrote O'Reilly an email before 9/11 saying we need another Boston Tea Party because the frustration that I saw happening in our government, slowly, this incremental frog - put the frog in the pan and turn up the heat - no one had done anything. No one had said anything.""He saw this frustration as the genesis of the Tea Party movement and saluted Andrew Breitbart as one of the few who saw and understood Americans' growing disenchantment with their political class. However, the signs were there long ago, for those who cared to look, as Davi recalled reading a New York Times article about mass layoffs in the steel industry that ""scared the hell"" out of him because the laid-off workers were expected to deal with the loss of 25-year careers.""And then my own dad lost his job after 20-something years, and he had to go do something else,"" Davi recalled. ""So I saw that firsthand. It started slow, the dissolvement of the American worker and our industries and everything leaving America, being sold, whatever it was. Globalism was on the march.""""This, to me, is why these Hollywood types, they have no concern. They don't see past their nose. They don't see past their cultural little circle. They go to the fundraisers, and they can talk among themselves, and that's the agenda,"" he said. ""I mean, George Lopez, all these guys coming out, saying these terrible things, instead of wanting to say, 'Let's make America great again. Let's go together on this. This sounds exciting.'"" ""We've got some fresh blood. We've got an energized human being. They're just worried about not being able to continue the destruction of our nation because that's what was happening.

There is something so infecting, and what I think it is, Alex, they're pure globalists, you see.""He noted that Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin has purchased six major Hollywood studios, accelerating a globalist trend that benefits top Hollywood talent and financiers, but leaves the many lower-level people involved in film production out in the cold. ""He just bought Dick Clark productions. He already owns a lot of it. They're building an $8 billion studio in China. Now, that's all good for Bryan Cranston, and de Niro, and myself. They can hire me for a film, and I can fly there. But what about the key grips? What about them? What about the makeup artists? What about the transportation guys? What about the set builders? What about the dry cleaners, and the restaurateurs?"" Davi asked. ""There are two big exports America had: wheat, and American entertainment, besides the car industry,"" he observed. ""So they're globalists, you see? And all the studio heads and the directors, all the above-the-line guys, can go anywhere. They're needed. They don't give a red rat's ass about the American worker."" He said the Republicans were clearly becoming the party of the forgotten American worker, in what he described as an ""amazing shift.""""What Donald Trump has done is, he has just extended this whole Republican party. He's rejuvenated the Republican Party. He's given it a rebirth. Believe it,"" said Davi. ""I left the Republican Party. I became an independent, more than several years ago, because of the frustration. I had gone on Hannity many years ago, saying that both the Left and the Right have failed America. I wrote O'Reilly an email before 9/11 saying we need another Boston Tea Party because the frustration that I saw happening in our government, slowly, this incremental frog - put the frog in the pan and turn up the heat - no one had done anything. No one had said anything.""He saw this frustration as the genesis of the Tea Party movement and saluted Andrew Breitbart as one of the few who saw and understood Americans' growing disenchantment with their political class. However, the signs were there long ago, for those who cared to look, as Davi recalled reading a New York Times article about mass layoffs in the steel industry that ""scared the hell"" out of him because the laid-off workers were expected to deal with the loss of 25-year careers.""And then my own dad lost his job after 20-something years, and he had to go do something else,"" Davi recalled. ""So I saw that firsthand. It started slow, the dissolvement of the American worker and our industries and everything leaving America, being sold, whatever it was. Globalism was on the march.""""This, to me, is why these Hollywood types, they have no concern. They don't see past their nose. They don't see past their cultural little circle. They go to the fundraisers, and they can talk among themselves, and that's the agenda,"" he said. ""I mean, George Lopez, all these guys coming out, saying these terrible things, instead of wanting to say, 'Let's make America great again. Let's go together on this. This sounds exciting.'"" ""We've got some fresh blood. We've got an energized human being. They're just worried about not being able to continue the destruction of our nation because that's what was happening. They were destroying our nation,"" Davi charged."

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe use of earmarks was banned in a 2010 spending reform imposed by former House Speaker John Boehner. But GOP legislators may decide in a secret vote on Wednesday whether to revive earmarks. According to Heritage's publication, The Daily Signal:Reps. John Culberson of Texas, Mike Rogers of Alabama, and Tom Rooney of Florida are listed as sponsors of the amendment, a copy of which was obtained by The Daily Signal.The earmark term is jargon for the practice of steering taxpayers' dollars into a legislator's home district, for example, the construction of a new bridge.Without earmarking, the money is appropriated to programs that are run by federal agencies, which then have some ability to steer the funds to the highest priority, and to make companies bid for contracts. For example, a federal or state transportation agency might calculate that the construction funds which a legislator wants for his home-district bridge would be better spent building a road elsewhere. ""The problem of earmarking goes far beyond the actual pork projects set aside for a specific politician,"" said Dan Horowitz, the editor of Conservative Review.The problem is that the GOP leadership will use earmarks to bribe and threaten unwilling legislators to follow the leaders on big issues, such as increasing the nation's debt or boosting overall spending, said Horowitz, editor of Conservative Review and author of Stolen Sovereignty: How to Stop Unelected Judges from Transforming America.""The problem is not about the relatively low cost of a single earmark,"" he said.It's about the $500,000 earmark that is used to buy off a conservative vote for a $1 trillion omnibus, farm bill, bailout, or some other terrible transformational legislation.  The earmarks are used as the magic ""grease"" to garner majority support for big-government legislation.  Once we reinstate the practice of earmarking, we will never be able to mobilize a majority within the conference to oppose any big-government legislation.  Most of them will be seduced into supporting bad legislation through personal earmarks for their districts.  This is the ""multiplying factor"" of earmarks.  Throw in a personal perk for each district, and you can get a majority of the House to vote for anything.The earmark process can be also used by top leaders to win political goals that are strongly opposed by voters, Horowitz warned.It's not just fiscal issues either.  Say they'd want to pass an expansive immigration bill or legislation empowering judges to reduce sentences for criminals.  GOP leaders could [use earmarks to] buy off members one by one, who would otherwise be circumspect of the legislation, simply because they want the bragging rights of bringing home a project to their districts.When he was a Senator, Jim DeMint, now the president of the Heritage Foundation, prodded and pushed his Senate peers to bar earmarks. ""This was an enduring legacy of Jim DeMint,"" Horowitz said.  ""And it has made it easier for us to stop all sorts of bad legislation.""One way to fix the problem of earmarks is to move spending decisions out of Washington, Horowitz said. ""We need to give the responsibility and revenue for surface transportation back to the states,"" he said. ""This will obviate the need for earmarks and make the system much more efficient.  If you want to satisfy the local transportation needs, you allow the states to craft their own highway policies.""Reps. John Culberson of Texas, Mike Rogers of Alabama, and Tom Rooney of Florida are listed as sponsors of the amendment, a copy of which was obtained by The Daily Signal.

And if he were to sign a bill making national reciprocity the law of the land, it would automatically override the limits on concealed carry that exist in states like CA, IL, NY, and NJ, and would allow a concealed permit holder from Oklahoma to legally carry his gun in California for self-defense.It would allow a concealed permit holder in Wisconsin to carry a gun in Chicago for self-defense-something currently banned by Illinois law-and it would allow a concealed permit from Texas to legally carry a gun in New York for self-defense. Likewise, a concealed carry permit holder from Colorado or Idaho would be able to carry a gun for self-defense in New Jersey.Seen in this light, national reciprocity would really serve as a preemption law; a law that would bar states from rejecting a license that had been granted federal recognition. It is very similar to the way things work with a driver's license.Trump first made his support for national reciprocity clear when he released a position paper on his gun policy in September 2015. In that release he wrote:The right of self-defense doesn't stop at the end of your driveway. That's why I have a concealed carry permit and why tens of millions of Americans do too. That permit should be valid in all 50 states. A driver's license works in every state, so it's common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state. If we can do that for driving - which is a privilege, not a right - then surely we can do that for concealed carry, which is a right, not a privilege.National reciprocity in a crucial step toward ensuring Americans with concealed carry permits have the ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights regardless of their geographic location.

Whites fell victim in the second largest hate crime demographic slot, with a total of 734 offenses. Hispanics, however, suffered 379 offenses.Americans of Middle-Eastern descent saw far fewer hate crimes in 2015 than other races/eternities with 47 offenses reported by law enforcement.With respect to hate crimes that are motivated against a victim's religious belief, Jewish Americans saw more than double the hate crimes against them than Muslim Americans. In 2015, Jews saw 695 total offenses, while Muslims experienced less than half that amount with 301 reported offenses.Americans with ""other religions"" and Catholics were some of the others likely to have hate crimes committed against them.Gay men, which Breitbart Tech Editor Milo Yiannopoulos has warned, are under threat due to a spike in Muslim migration to the country, have seen disproportionately high hate crime incidents against them when compared to other sexual orientation cohorts. Men, specifically, suffered 758 offenses due to their sexual orientation, a slight increase from 2014 levels. Roughly 18 percent of all hate crimes were because of a bias against a sexual orientation.For Americans with disabilities, physical and mental, hate crimes decreased from 2014 with 88 offenses, compared to the previous 95.Liberal-leaning states have largely higher hate crime levels than traditional red states.

The remaining 5 percent went to other candidates.In elite coastal county after elite coastal county, especially those in Washington, D.C. and its Virginia and Maryland suburbs where so many federal government workers and federal contractors live, Clinton won by margins ranging from four to one to two to one.Votes cast in the 52 elite coastal counties where Clinton dominated accounted for only 14.4 percent of the estimated 127.7 million total votes cast in the country.In contrast, the 3,084 counties in America's heartland, where Trump dominated with a healthy 7 point margin, accounted for 85.6 percent of all votes cast.Clinton's 671,066 popular vote margin across the entire country, 61,047,027 votes to Donald Trump's 60,375,961 votes (according to Politico's election results website as of Tuesday morning) arose from this huge advantage wracked up in these elite coastal counties.Clinton received 47.7 percent of the estimated 127.7 million votes cast nationwide, while Trump received 47.2 percent of those votes. Five percent went to other candidates.Trump campaigned very little in the 23 elite coastal counties in the West Coast states of California, Oregon, and Washington, and only vigorously campaigned in five Northern Virginia counties and Philadelphia on the East Coast.It is worth noting that virtually all members of the mainstream media reside within this narrow band of elite coastal counties.Clinton won the 161 electoral college votes in nine of these ten states, as well in the District of Columbia. Among these ten states, Trump won only Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral college votes.But these nine states experienced the same kind of bimodal divide seen in the rest of the country.In eight of these nine states (all but Massachusetts) Trump was tied or slightly ahead of Clinton in the popular vote in those counties outside the coastal elite.Here is the full list of these 52 elite coastal counties:(California: Alameda, Contra Costa, Humboldt, Los Angeles, Marin, Mendocino, Monterey, Napa, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Solano, Sonoma, and Ventura; Oregon: Multnomah and Washington; Washington: King and Snohomish; Virginia: Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William (and the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, and Falls Church); Washington, D.C.; Maryland: Baltimore, Charles, Howard, Montgomery, and Prince George's (and the city of Baltimore); Pennsylvania: Delaware and Philadelphia; New Jersey: Essex, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Passaic, and Union; New York: Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, and Westchester; Connecticut: Fairfield, Hartford, and New Haven; and Massachusetts: Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, and Suffolk.)SIGN UP"

""We have to reclaim it.""The forum, which continues on Wednesday, is organised by the MiSK Foundation which aims to generate youth initiative.It was founded by 31-year-old Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who in April launched the wide-ranging Vision 2030 plan for enhancing the role of the private sector as part of economic diversification.SIGN UP"

He has been particularly concerned with the dangerous trend of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel sentiment on U.S. college campuses. While at Breitbart, he pitched countless articles on these and other themes in defense of the Jewish state.""Breitbart's Joel Pollak made similar remarks: ""I have worked with Stephen K. Bannon, President-elect Donald Trump's new chief strategist and senior counselor, for nearly six years at Breitbart News. I can say, without hesitation, that Steve is a friend of the Jewish people and a defender of Israel, as well as being a passionate American patriot and a great leader.""Pollak pointed to his ""credentials"" to comment on the matter: ""I am an Orthodox Jew, and I hold a Master of Arts degree in Jewish Studies. My thesis at the Isaac and Jesse Kaplan Centre at the University of Cape Town dealt with the troubled status of Jews in an increasingly anti-Israel, and anti-Semitic, post-apartheid South Africa. I believe myself to be a qualified judge of what is, and is not, anti-Semitic.""Pollak asserted it ""defies logic that a man who was a close friend, confidant, and adviser to the late Andrew Breitbart -- a proud Jew -- could have any negative feelings towards Jews.""""As I can testify from years of work together with Steve in close quarters, the opposite is the case: Steve is outraged by anti-Semitism. If anything, he is overly sensitive about it, and often takes offense on Jews' behalf.""Yesterday, Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) President Morton A. Klein released a statement calling the anti-Semitism claims ""painful"" while describing Bannon as a defender of Israel:It is painful to see Anti-Defamation League (ADL) president Jonathan Greenblatt engaging in character assassination against President-elect Trump's appointee Stephen Bannon and Mr. Bannon's company, Breitbart media. ADL/Greenblatt essentially accused Mr. Bannon and his media company of ""anti-Semitism"" and Israel hatred, when Jonathan Greenblatt/ADL tweeted that Bannon ""presided over the premier website of the 'alt right' - a loose-knit group of white nationalists and anti-Semites."" ...ZOA's own experience and analysis of Breitbart articles confirms Mr. Bannon's and Breitbart's friendship and fair-mindedness towards Israel and the Jewish people. To accuse Mr. Bannon and Breitbart of anti-Semitism is Orwellian. In fact, Breitbart bravely fights against anti-Semitism. Here are a few of the many examples:Stephen Bannon joined ZOA in fighting the anti-Semitic rallies at CUNY by requiring his Breitbart reporters to call CUNY officials and Gov. Cuomo aides urging them to do something about it.Mark Levin took to his radio show on Monday to argue that the allegations of anti-Semitism against Bannon are ""absolutely ridiculous.""Breitbart reported Levin said that while he has ""strong disagreements"" with Bannon's support of the ""nationalist/populist movement,"" charges of anti-Semitism against ""absolutely outrageous."" Levin continued, ""He's in partnership over there at Breitbart, the guy he has a partnership with, he's a Jew. He's been all Trump, pretty much, even though they pretended for Cruz, but he's been all Trump, and Trump's son-in-law's an Orthodox Jew. Ivanka Trump converted to Orthodox Judaism."" Levin added that Bannon had been pro-Israel as long as he's known him.He continued, ""Now, it is true that this alt-right crowd, which I find repulsive, repulsive, has white supremacist leanings and white supremacists in it. I am unaware that Bannon and the rest are part of that movement. It's not the same thing as the populist movement.""Levin also pointed to the establishment of Breitbart Jerusalem, which is headed by Klein, during Bannon's tenure at the site.SIGN UP"

They each took turns holding a yellow ball and expressed a gamut of emotions from happiness and sadness to despair to hopelessness about the future.""The students described in the article are nine years old. It is unclear whether any were allowed to express emotions other than fear and despair.In some cases, rather than prepare children for the election by explaining that there are two parties, and that one party cannot win all of the time, educators either passively or actively allowed students to believe that one side represented Light and Truth, while the other side represented The End of the World.The Palm Springs Desert Sun, for example, reported before the election:For some teachers, this election causes them pause. Forty-three percent of teachers surveyed said they were hesitant to teach about the 2016 presidential election and some reported avoiding the subject altogether, according to theSPLC. But for others, the election is a call to action.Two weeks ago, 10 former state and national Teachers of the Year published an open letter acknowledging the tradition of political neutrality in the classroom but saying that to remain silent would be to become morally complicit. The letter described Trump as a ""danger to our society in general and to our students in particular.""The result, after Election Day: anger, fear, and outrage among children who have been ill-prepared for the result.High school students in Palo Alto, for example, disrupted traffic on Monday afternoon -- and had clearly been misinformed about the election and the positions of the candidates.One 16-year-old told the San Jose Mercury News:DeMartini said the discourse during the campaign and Trump's ideals affect her personally as a young woman of this generation, and that it goes against all the advances for women her own mom fought for years ago.""I'm learning in history class about women's rights,"" DeMartini said, ""and I'm more aware now of how the decisions people in power make affect women. It's scary.""Students have staged walkouts across the Bay Area and in Los Angeles to protest the results of the election. While police have warned that students who leave school can be arrested, teachers and principals have tolerated, and in some cases encouraged, the demonstrations.One student told the Mercury News about the traffic disruption: ""Our school's motto is 'Strength in Diversity,' ... Our principal told us today she'd support us and provide a safe space for us to express ourselves. It felt really, really good to do something.""Joel B.

Earmarks were the stock and trade of congressional leaders in both houses and both parties, but in the last decade, they became a symbol of flagrant spending and corruption.Speaker of the House John Boehner made the abolition of earmarks one of his personal agenda items when he first entered Congress in 1991 and before his 2015 retirement from Congress, he claimed victory.In a 2008 speech to the National Urban League's annual legislative policy conference, Boehner said:The Democrat-controlled Congress last December slashed funding for the bipartisan Reading First initiative from $1 billion to $393 million.  At the same time, Congress spent billions of taxpayer dollars on earmarks requested by Members of Congress for their congressional districts, even endorsing construction of a taxpayer-funded ""hippie museum"" in Woodstock, NY at the request of Sen.

The video, along with a second video that does not have sound, but shows what appears to be the start of the man being dragged as someone else speeds off in the car, was posted by the Chicago Tribune.The Tribune identifies the man as David Wilcox, 49, who said it started when a black sedan grazed his vehicle and, after he got out to ask for insurance, the beating began. Wilcox said he tried to get back in his car, but someone else got into the driver's seat. As Wilcox tried to get him out, he grabbed onto the door frame and was dragged as the car drove off - the driver driving at high speeds, attempting to get Wilcox to fall off of the car.Now the Public Interest Legal Foundation is charging the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate the altercation with two letters sent to DOJ officials.In a release regarding the letters, the Foundation recounts the attack and shouts from bystanders including one Wilcox recalled, ""it's one of them white boy Trump guys."" Wilcox has said that he did vote for Trump in the November 8, 2016 presidential election.The Foundation sent one letter to Chris Herren, Chief of the Voting Section of the U.S. Department of Justice. That letter states, in part, ""The statements of those encouraging the beating would support an investigation under Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act, now codified at 52 U.S.C. Section 10307(b)."" Wilcox has said the altercation began with the contact between the vehicle, but the release notes the egging on of the bystanders and goes on to state, ""The attackers follow these racially and politically motivated suggestions.""Letter to Voting Section Chief [4] by Breitbart News on ScribdThat letter goes on to allege that ""that the Department has different standards for enforcing the law depending on the nature of the victim and the nature of the perpetrators.""A comparison is then made to a DOJ investigation into the altercation between Michael Brown and officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri that ultimately resulted in evidence vindicating officer Wilson, but not before his career with the police department was ended. ""Your Section has an opportunity here to help resolve that question with the attack on Mr. Wilcox. If the Division does not vigorously pursue an investigation into whether the Voting Rights Act was violated - as vigorously as it pursued other recent high profile racially charged cases such as in Ferguson, Missouri - it raises profound questions about the Section's suitability to fairly enforce the laws as currently composed.""The Foundation sent a second letter to Paige Fitzgerald, Acting Chief of the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. DOJ. The second letter makes similar comparison to the Ferguson investigation as to this case.Criminal Section to Criminal Section Chief [2] by Breitbart News on ScribdThe second letter focuses in on the issue of voter intimidation, reading, in part:Considering the Section's prior enforcement activities, this incident was a likely violation of 18 U.S.C.

Christian Adams, President of the Public Interest Legal Foundation. ""Americans should not have to fear political violence because they voted for Donald Trump, and this Justice Department needs to start enforcing the law no matter who the victim is.""Chicago chief police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said following the incident that the department was taking the case very seriously and ""that type of divisive rhetoric is not acceptable"" according to the Tribune.

When Magal quit the Knesset amid allegations of sexual harassment, Roy Folkman of the Kulanu party took over efforts to pass it.Read more here.SIGN UP
