We have no growth in this country. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. We're down to 1 percent. And that's like no growth. We're going lower in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world. And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it's so important, one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.""She,"" of course, refers to Hillary Clinton. Trump was speaking in the context of his own plan to lower taxes to spur economic growth, versus Clinton's plan to raise taxes.Trump said U.S. GDP growth is ""down to 1 percent."" In fact, GDP growth was originally reported as 1.1 percent for the second quarter of 2016, and later revised up to 1.4 percent. Trump's statement is very close to the original number, and only a bit of an overstatement for the revised number.As for Trump's assessment of the U.S. as having ""just about the highest"" taxes in the world, he did leave himself a bit of wiggle room by saying ""just about."" More importantly, to assess the truth of his statement, we must consider which taxes he's talking about. There are numerous countries with higher income tax rates - America is not even Top 10 on that score. But U.S. does have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world - currently the third highest, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. Given Puerto Rico's unique status, it would be fair to say the United States has the second highest tax rate of any nation.America's top marginal corporate tax rate is 35%, while the world average is only 22.5%, and the European average is about 19%. Trump wants to dramatically reduce the U.S. rate to 15%.Given the context of his remarks, it seems fair to assume he was talking about corporate tax rates when he said America's were among the highest in the world, although he did not explicitly state that.

However, media commentators denied Trump the outright win, or said it would not matter.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCNN's Jake Tapper, for one, said tt the debate was a ""wash."" His colleague, Gloria Borger, said: ""He may have done enough to stop the bleeding. I'm not sure any minds were changed at this debate tonight. I think so much has occurred over the last 48 hours and this last week that people have to digest all of this, including the debate tonight, to see where they stand.""

But Smerconish added that Trump had fallen short, regardless: ""Did he grow the tent? I can't see that there was any outreach.""Trump beat Clinton despite facing a three-on-one press from his opponent and from the moderators, who were at least as biased as they had been in any of the previous debates. CNN's Anderson Cooper fired repeated follow-ups at Trump while leaving Clinton largely alone. But he, at least, brought up tough questions for Clinton on occasion. ABC News' Martha Raddatz actively debated Trump at times, and silenced the audience when it cheered for Trump -- though not for Clinton.Still, Trump overcame that hostility and pressed Clinton effectively on the issues, as well as on her weakest points -- the email scandal, Benghazi, and Obamacare. He was on better ground than Clinton when it came to citing facts, and he forced her into repeating the rather serious lie that the only emails she deleted from her private server were personal in nature. He also stood his ground on substantive policy questions while maintaining his cool -- for the most part -- when she tried personal attacks.The media had largely declared the presidential race for Hillary Clinton Saturday, after many Republicans criticized Trump over comments he made in 2005 about groping women. The comments were captured by a live mic and surfaced Friday. Chuck Todd, political director of NBC News, said ""the presidential race is over,"" according to Republicans with whom he spoke. Despite Trump's debate win, the media will be reluctant to let go of that narrative, with many cheering for his demise.At the first debate, Trump refrained from placing any of the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual impropriety in the front row, despite threatening to do so. This time, with the media and the Hillary Clinton campaign hitting Trump over his old remarks, Trump more than delivered on the threat, holding a press conference with four of Bill Clinton's accusers -- who also accused Hillary Clinton of trying to silence and slander them -- before the debate, and placing them in the front row.The Donald Trump that debated Hillary Clinton in St. Louis was better prepared, more passionate, and more focused on the issues than he was two weeks ago. He won, under incredible pressure.The voters will see it, even if the media will not.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

In June, the Washington Post gave her copious benefit of the doubt for being in favor of the concept behind the bill, but if she played any role in winning congressional approval, it was ""hidden"" and ""debatable.""""By all accounts, the prime mover behind CHIP was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He was inspired by a similar Massachusetts program and then enlisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) as his partner in the effort. The idea was to fund children's health care with money raised from taxes on tobacco products. Bill Clinton endorsed the idea in his 1997 State of the Union address but then backed off when it appeared that the concept would imperil budget talks with Republicans. With urging from the president, a Senate vote in May doomed the plan,"" said the Washington Post fact-check.Efforts to fact-check Hillary Clinton's role in pushing the bill have produced conflicting accounts - which, in and of itself, refutes her claim of bold bipartisan leadership. If Clinton was the driving force behind getting Democrats and Republicans together on CHIP, rather than Kennedy and Hatch, there wouldn't be any real dispute about her role.Also, the accounts that do give her credit for helping with the bill are mostly words of appreciation from friendly Democrats, such as Kennedy's office. For example, a senior health adviser to Kennedy, Nick Littlefield, said of Clinton: ""She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions. But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.""That encomium hardly supports Clinton's claim of playing a leading role in rallying congressional support; she was, at best, useful for encouraging her husband's White House to stick with the bill.Clinton has occasionally claimed to have played a role in creating the CHIP legislation, a claim no knowledgeable contemporaneous source seems willing to support. More damningly, a 2008 review by the Boston Globe - fact-checking Clinton's claims during her primary run against Barack Obama - found that Clinton ""had little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress, according to several lawmakers, staffers, and healthcare advocates involved in the issue.""Orrin Hatch himself said of Clinton, ""I do like her. We all care about children. But does she deserve credit for SCHIP? No - Teddy does, but she doesn't."" (""Teddy"" is a reference to Senator Ted Kennedy.)BREITBART LIVEDuring the second presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed to have had a leadership role in rallying bipartisan support for the Children's Health Insurance Program with bipartisan, which was signed into law in 1998 by her husband, President Bill ClintonFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEClinton has frequently made this claim on the campaign trail, so media organizations have already had an opportunity to vet it. In June, the Washington Post gave her copious benefit of the doubt for being in favor of the concept behind the bill, but if she played any role in winning congressional approval, it was ""hidden"" and ""debatable.""Washington Post""By all accounts, the prime mover behind CHIP was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He was inspired by a similar Massachusetts program and then enlisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) as his partner in the effort. The idea was to fund children's health care with money raised from taxes on tobacco products. Bill Clinton endorsed the idea in his 1997 State of the Union address but then backed off when it appeared that the concept would imperil budget talks with Republicans. With urging from the president, a Senate vote in May doomed the plan,"" said the Washington Post fact-check.Efforts to fact-check Hillary Clinton's role in pushing the bill have produced conflicting accounts - which, in and of itself, refutes her claim of bold bipartisan leadership. If Clinton was the driving force behind getting Democrats and Republicans together on CHIP, rather than Kennedy and Hatch, there wouldn't be any real dispute about her role.Also, the accounts that do give her credit for helping with the bill are mostly words of appreciation from friendly Democrats, such as Kennedy's office. For example, a senior health adviser to Kennedy, Nick Littlefield, said of Clinton: ""She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions. But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.""That encomium hardly supports Clinton's claim of playing a leading role in rallying congressional support; she was, at best, useful for encouraging her husband's White House to stick with the bill.Clinton has occasionally claimed to have played a role in creating the CHIP legislation, a claim no knowledgeable contemporaneous source seems willing to support. More damningly, a 2008 review by the Boston Globe - fact-checking Clinton's claims during her primary run against Barack Obama - found that Clinton ""had little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress, according to several lawmakers, staffers, and healthcare advocates involved in the issue.""Boston GlobeOrrin Hatch himself said of Clinton, ""I do like her.

And I'm hoping that whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a big piece of legislation you're going to have, those will be remedied and we can really take a hard look at what's succeeding, fix what isn't, and keep moving forward to get to affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada."" (January 2015)What Clinton says in public is often very different than what she tells her private speaking audiences. For example, she recently said she thought single-payer would ""never, ever happen,"" but she was making a prediction and saying that ObamaCare repairs couldn't wait for a single-payer system to be created, not expressing her own policy preference: ""I want you to understand why I am fighting so hard for the Affordable Care Act. I don't want it repealed, I don't want us to be thrown back into a terrible, terrible national debate. I don't want us to end up in gridlock. People can't wait! People who have health emergencies can't wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass.""During Clinton's primary run against Bernie Sanders, the New York Times found her moving to the left on health care and saying she was ""in favor of what's called the public option, so that people can buy into Medicare at a certain age."" Sanders was explicitly in favor of single-payer health care... and described it as ""Medicare for all.""New York Times"	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	['healthcare']

A child rape victim says she cannot forgive Hillary Clinton for defending her rapist in court 40 years ago, saying the Democratic presidential candidate attacked her credibility despite knowing that her assailant was guilty - and later laughed about it in a taped interview.
Kathy Shelton was just 12 years old when a 41-year-old drifter raped her on the side of a desolate Arkansas road in 1975.
Now, four decades later, she has agreed to be named and pictured for the first time in this Daily Mail Online exclusive because she is furious that her rapist's defense attorney - Hillary Clinton - has been portraying herself as a lifelong advocate of women and girls on the campaign trail.
'It's put a lot of anger back in me,' said Shelton, now 54, in an exclusive interview at her Springdale, Arkansas, home in August. 'Every time I see [Clinton] on TV I just want to reach in there and grab her, but I can't do that.'
In 1975, Clinton served as the defense lawyer for Thomas Alfred Taylor, a 41-year-old factory worker accused of raping Shelton after luring her to his car.
Taylor pleaded down to 'unlawful fondling of a minor' and served less than a year in prison after Clinton was able to block the admission of forensic evidence that linked her client to the crime.

The NYT reports that Mastramico tried other supplements but to no avail.After she went to an industry group meeting for cannabis entrepreneurs, she got a medical marijuana card and tried two edible oils made from cannabis on her cat with successful results.The NYT reports that regulators have not approved these cannabis-based treatments, but pet owners have used the treatments on their dogs, cats, pigs, horses, and domesticated wild animals.The Food and Drug Administration, for example, has not approved marijuana-based treatments for animals because there is little research showing the drug's effectiveness.Veterinarians are not allowed to write prescriptions for cannabis-based products and are hesitant to discuss the idea in states where marijuana is illegal.Last year, a bill that would legalize marijuana for sick pets was defeated in the Nevada state legislature, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.But this hasn't stopped pet owners from giving cannabis-based products to their pets.Cate Norton, 36, of Springfield, Vermont, where medical marijuana is legal, gives her 3-year-old dog Leia a cannabis-based product for her seizures.Norton said, ""there has been a great reduction in the severity of her seizures"" over the eight months she had been treating her dog.""My vet would like to do it but can't legally touch it,"" she said.Pet owners in California, where medical marijuana has been legal for two decades, have bucked the trend in pets getting medical marijuana treatments.Melinda Hayes, 39, runs a full-service medical marijuana delivery service that works with animals as well as people.Hayes gets most of her calls about pet care and tries to see as many animals as possible.""I go as often as I can to meet the pet,"" Hayes said.
