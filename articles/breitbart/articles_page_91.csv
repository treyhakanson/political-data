At its peak that day, Matthew's 160 miles-per-hour winds were as powerful as Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, which is rated as ""the most destructive storm in the U.S. modern history."" However, the storm weakened in the last 24 hours to a still-ferocious Category 4 storm, with winds of up to 150-mph winds.As the most ferocious Atlantic hurricane in almost a decade, the double-eyed Matthew is set to hit land at the Southern tip of impoverished Haiti on Tuesday morning.With Hurricane Matthew moving at a 6 mile-per-hour clip, the U.S. National Weather Service expects the storm to dump an average of between 15 to 25 inches of rain on Haiti, with as much as 40 inches in some areas.""This rainfall will produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,"" the National Weather Service warned on Sunday, ""Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.""Civil protection officials throughout the Caribbean are broadcasting warnings of a coming storm surge, stating that southern low-lying areas will be ""highly threatened"" from the approaching storm system and urging people to prepare emergency survival kits.According to the US National Hurricane Center's (NHC) latest projection, Matthew is expected to remain a powerful hurricane through at least Monday night. After hitting Haiti and Jamaica on Tuesday morning, Matthew is expected to reach Cuba by late evening.The current track indicates Matthew will smash directly into the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, or Gitmo. The Naval command is evacuating hundreds of personnel, family members and non-essential staff from Gitmo to a Florida base, according to Stratfor Global Intelligence.""The remaining military and civilian personnel will shelter in place and be able to support recovery efforts once safe to do so following the storm's passage,"" the Navy said in a press release.The exact path of the monster storm is indeterminate at this time, and Matthew's destructive power could increase substantially if it veers out to warm ocean waters, where it would pick up huge strength before veering back to clobber the East Coast.At a minimum, Hurricane Matthew will begin moving up the U.S. southern East Coast with winds of at least 110 miles-per-hour on Thursday morning. The U.S. National Weather Service predicts dangerous swells, coastal flooding, and beach erosion as far north as Virginia, but warns that the Mid-Atlantic and New England states could be affected within two weeks.

Bush Daughter Seen at $5K Per Ticket Clinton Fundraiser	"It appears that there is another member of the Bush clan supporting Hillary Clinton for president after reports surfaced that George W's daughter, Barbara, attended a Saturday night fundraiser for Hillary. The $5,000 per ticket event allowed partygoers the opportunity to hobnob with Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBarbara Bush spent the night of October 1 rubbing elbows with Abedin in Paris, France, at a special Clinton fundraiser held during the City of Light's famed Paris Fashion Week. According to The Daily Mail, Bush ""paid at least $5,000 for the privilege.""The party featured Abedin, Hollywood actress Dakota Fanning, and other celebrities. Black Eyed Peas band member Will.i.am also participated in events during the weekend geared at ""mobiliz[ing] the expat vote with just five weeks to go.""Left to right: Huma Abedin, Derek Blasberg, Barbara Bush, actress Dakota Fanning, and hostess Lauren Santo Domingo (Instagram / @thelsd)The special party was co-hosted by Vogue magazine's editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and concluded with a dinner at American socialite Lauren Santo Domingo's Paris home with tickets costing $5,000 per seat ($10,000 to ""co-host"" with ""preferred seating"").Huma Abedin, Hillary's long-time top aide, has been in the news quite a bit lately. She was embarrassed yet again by the sexual abuse allegations against her husband, Anthony Weiner. The one-time Congressman is now under investigation for soliciting sex from a 15-year-old girl. He was also condemned for allegedly using his infant son as a ""chick magnet"" to get women.But more worrisome is Abedin's troubling involvement with Hillary's email scandal. During an FBI investigation, for instance, Abedin told agents she had no knowledge of Hillary's illegal email server yet released documents suggests she lied to the FBI.Despite all these scandals, young Barbara Bush was seen mingling with Abedin and, according to The Daily Mail, shelling out big dollars for Hillary's campaign to do so.Barbara is hardly the first Bush said to be refusing to support the duly nominated candidate for the Republican Party, Donald Trump, and supporting Clinton instead. Many were aghast when her grandfather, former President George H.W. Bush, was reported as telling a member of the Kennedy clan that he was voting for Hillary.The former President is only one of the Bush clan seemingly acting the turncoat to his own party. H.W.'s son, former Florida Governor and failed GOP presidential candidate, Jeb Bush, has also been on record as refusing to support his own party.Even after Donald Trump essentially won the GOP nomination for president, for instance, Jeb petulantly insisted that he would never vote for Trump. And at the end of September, Jeb reiterated his refusal to support the party by insisting that Republicans should stay home in November because, in his estimation, not voting would make a ""powerful political statement.""Jeb's super rich, establishment donors have followed their preferred candidate's lead, too. One Bush donor pledged to donate a whopping $2 million to Hillary's Latino outreach program to help her get elected in November.Still another Bush has also been reticent to support the party's nominee. Texas Land Commissioner and Texas GOP Victory Chair George P. Bush, Jeb's son, initially said he would never vote for Donald Trump. But only a few months later it appears he softened his stance by saying it is important to stop Hillary so Republicans should ""swallow a bitter pill"" and vote Trump.But not everyone in the Bush family orbit have turned against the Republican Party. Recently no less than 50 Bush appointees came out with a bold and forceful endorsement of Donald Trump.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

The attempted robbery occurred at the Jones Road store at about 9 p.m. Friday night, according to KHOU CBS11.The gun owner, who is legally licensed to carry a handgun drew his weapon and entered the store as the would-be robbers were demanding cash from the store employees. He demanded the three suspects drop their weapons and get down on the ground.He then held the suspects at gunpoint while Harris County Sheriff's Office deputies were called to the scene. When the deputies arrived they took the three failed robbery suspects into custody.No shots were fired and no one was injured in the incident.KHOU stated the deputies praised the LTC licensee for his actions in stopping the robbery before anyone was hurt. Deputies said they do not; however, recommend that people take this action as it could cause a shootout and someone could get hurt.The three suspects will likely face felony charges of Aggravated Robbery with a deadly weapon in one of Harris County's State District Courts. No bond information is available at this time on the suspects who were taken to the Harris County Jail for processing.Texas law allows a person with a LTC license to carry a handgun openly or concealed. The law also allows a person to use deadly force, or the threat of deadly force, to protect their own life or the life of others.Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

In other words, their post-tax profit was higher than their pre-tax profit.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Sunday brushed off comments unearthed this weekend in which his former rival, Hillary Clinton, said that his supporters were ""still living in their parents' basement."" His answer: they are.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERClinton's comments, recorded at a fundraiser in McLean, VA in February and published by the Washington Free Beacon, also included several other digs at Sanders and his fans, saying that he was offering them a ""false promise."" But Sanders, far from taking offense, confirmed Clinton's condescending remarks.Clinton had said (emphasis added):Some are new to politics completely. They're children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents' basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don't see much of a future.Appearing on CNN's State of the Union with Jake Tapper, Sanders said (emphasis added):Well, I agree with her. What she is saying is what I suggested a moment ago. There are young people who went deeply into debt, worked very hard to get a good education, and yet they are getting out of school and can't find decent, paying jobs. And that is a major problem. They are living in their parents' basements. So that's the point there. So I personally do believe we do need a political revolution. That we do need to transform this society; create decent, paying jobs, make sure Donald Trump and his billionaire friends start paying their fair share of taxes; do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, address the crisis of climate change; transform our energy system, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do; raise the minimum wage to a living wage; and have pay equity for women. So I think that Secretary Clinton -- and by the way, as I said, I just talked to her a few days ago, she is prepared on all of those issues to move forward within the first 100 days of her administration. And on top of that, unlike Donald Trump, she understands that Citizens United Supreme Court decision is undermining American democracy. It has got to be overturned. She will be supporting the constitutional amendment to do that so that billionaires cannot continue buying elections in this country.Asked by Tapper what he would say to a supporter who found it condescending to be described as a ""basement-dwelling barista that is buying false promises from Bernie Sanders,"" Sanders said that supporters should choose between the candidates based on their positions on the issues.Joel B.

As the online record of who is in custody in Washington County shows, the 34-year-old suspect is currently facing 18 charges.Even more shocking: a lawsuit filed on behalf of the 87-year-old victim claims that many of the assaults could've been prevented had the hospital where the accused rapist worked acted after the 94-year-old victim told the hospital she had been raped back in June.The lawsuit alleges that Providence St. Vincent Medical Center:knew and had reason to know that Adeladilew Mekonen had abused and was likely to again sexually abuse ill and elderly female patients, including plaintiff, if he were allowed to be alone with them in their rooms, and yet defendant Providence directed and allowed Mekonen to continue to attend such female patients, including plaintiff, under such circumstances.As the 87-year-old woman's attorney Greg Kafoury told Portland TV station KOIN: ""When you get an accusation as serious as this, you're really supposed to do something about it,"" Kafoury said about the hospital's actions. ""You're not supposed to look for the first door out and try to look for a way to say it never happened.""It is unclear what happened in June after the lawsuit claims the 94-year-old woman told the hospital she had been raped but Providence St. Vincent gave KOIN 6 News this statement:Providence has been working closely with law enforcement and prosecutors in this ongoing investigation. As additional patients contacted us, we worked with Washington County detectives to connect patients with investigators and conduct interviews. We played a direct part in helping detectives take action in these new cases. Providence is committed to the safety of our patients and their families. In all of our hospitals, we have a team of people working to review and investigate any patient concerns we receive. We work every day to earn the trust of our patients, just as we have been doing for 160 years.The suspect's neighbor, Jeff Reed, expressed dismay to news station KATU, telling the station he was shocked to hear the allegations after Mekonoen's arrest. ""I thought he was a very nice guy, family oriented,"" said Reed, who lives across from Mekonen at an apartment complex in Southeast Portland.Mekonen had been working at the hospital since May, just a month before the first rape was allegedly reported.Breitbart News has confirmed with the Washington County authorities that the suspect, Adeladilew Mekonen, told a detective that he came to the United States from Ethiopia in 2011.knew and had reason to know that Adeladilew Mekonen had abused and was likely to again sexually abuse ill and elderly female patients, including plaintiff, if he were allowed to be alone with them in their rooms, and yet defendant Providence directed and allowed Mekonen to continue to attend such female patients, including plaintiff, under such circumstances.Providence has been working closely with law enforcement and prosecutors in this ongoing investigation.

It is unacceptable that ""international bodies should make financial aid to poor countries dependent on the introduction of laws to establish 'marriage' between persons of the same sex,"" he said.In that same letter, Francis slammed gender theory for its denial of ""the difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman,"" and for its dream of ""a society without sexual differences.""""An appreciation of our body as male or female,"" he said, is ""necessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves."" Efforts to cancel out sexual differences based in anatomy are a symptom of a sick society that ""no longer knows how to deal with it,"" he wrote.This past August, after the Pope once again decried the introduction of gender theory into schools, LGBT activists reacted strongly, accusing Francis of butting in where he doesn't belong.Francis DeBernardo, the executive director of New Ways Ministry, a Catholic LGBT advocacy group, said that the Pope was ignorant about gender issues.""Nobody chooses a gender identity. They discover it,"" he said. ""Transgender people come to know themselves in a process is [sic] similar to the way that lesbian, gay, and bisexual people discover their sexual orientation.""DeBernardo added that ""most reputable scientific experts say that allowing children to transition in youth is both a physically and psychologically healthy thing for them to do in most cases.""That same month, however, the American College of Pediatricians issued a position paper warning that gender ideology is harmful to children.Failing to identify with one's biological sex signals a psychological disorder that must be dealt with, not pandered to, the physicians argued.""A person's belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking,"" the paper states. ""When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such.""Follow Thomas D.

But rather they do not really want to tinker with the memory so I apologize profoundly and deeply to the Jewish (people).""It was never my intention but the problem was I was criticized using Hitler, comparing to me. But I was very emphatic. I will kill the three million.""Duterte, 71, won elections in May in a landslide after a campaign dominated by his pledge to eradicate drugs in society by killing tens of thousands of people.Since taking office on June 30, police have killed more than 1,200 people and about 1,800 others have died in unexplained circumstances, according to official figures.While issuing his qualified apology on Friday, Duterte continued to lash out at Western critics and warned he was willing to kick all American troops out of the Philippines.""The Americans, I don't like them.... they are reprimanding me in public. So I say: 'Screw you, fuck you, everything else. You are stupid',"" he said.Duterte threatened to cancel a defense accord with the United States, the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), that went into force in January.That agreement, sealed under the administration of Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino, allows US forces access to five Philippine bases to help counterbalance a growing Chinese presence in the South China Sea.""This EDCA is an official document... but it does not bear the signature of the president of the republic,"" Duterte said.""Better think twice now because I will be asking you to leave the Philippines altogether.""The United States and the Philippines are longtime allies bound by a mutual defense pact.However Duterte has repeatedly threatened to move away from the United States and forge closer ties China and Russia.Duterte last month branded US President Barack Obama a ""son of a whore.""Duterte on Sunday also hit out at the Europeans saying: ""These stupid lawyers in the EU... well, screw you. I will kick you.""SIGN UP"

He also has two sisters, Nurhayat and Fazilet. Their current whereabouts are not known.In July, the authorities arrested Gulen's nephew Muhammet Sait Gulen in the eastern city of Erzurum, long seen as one of the hubs for his supporters.Another nephew, Ahmet Ramiz Gulen, was arrested in August in the southeastern city of Gaziantep.But this is believed to be the first time a brother has been detained.Turkey has asked the US authorities to extradite Gulen to face justice back home and expressed impatience with the slowness of the procedure. But Washington has insisted the full judicial process should be observed.SIGN UPISTANBUL (AFP) - "

Diplomatic efforts to stem the bloodshed have failed.""The healthcare system in eastern Aleppo is all but obliterated,"" O'Brien said, after the largest hospital in the rebel-controlled area was hit by barrel bombs on Saturday.""Medical facilities are being hit one by one,"" he added.O'Brien urged warring parties to at the very least allow medical evacuations for the hundreds of civilians in urgent need of care.The UN has said that water and food supplies in eastern Aleppo are running low, while efforts to bring in aid convoys through the Turkish border have been stalled by the fighting.The UN had hoped it could restock east Aleppo during a ceasefire negotiated last month by the United States and Russia, but security conditions to allow those deliveries were not met and the ceasefire quickly collapsed.With many basic medications now unavailable most supplies are running short, patients are being turned away from health centres and the need for evacuations is likely ""to rise dramatically in the coming days,"" O'Brien said.The battle for Aleppo has sparked some of the most brutal violence since the beginning in March 2011 of Syria's conflict, which has killed more than 300,000 people and displaced over half the population.SIGN UPGENEVA (AFP) -  "

Trump lambasted his opponent Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton for a secret tape recording of her bashing supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont--and even called for Clinton to be placed in prison and questioned as to whether she has been loyal to her husband former President Bill Clinton.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTrump said in the speech on Saturday night:A new audio tape that has surfaced just yesterday from another one of Hillary's high roller fundraisers shows her demeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. You know, and I'll tell you something we have a much bigger movement that Bernie Sanders ever had. We have much bigger crowds than Sanders ever had. And we have a more important movement than Bernie Sanders ever had because we're going to save our country, okay? We're going to save our country. But I can tell you Bernie Sanders would have left a great, great legacy had he not made the deal with the devil. He would have really left a great legacy. Now he shows up and 120 people come in to hear him talk. Bernie Sanders would have left a great legacy had he not made the deal, had he held his head high and walked away. Now he's on the other side perhaps from us and we want to get along with everybody and we will--we're going to unite the country--but what Bernie Sanders did to his supporters was very, very unfair. And they're really not his supporters any longer and they're not going to support Hillary Clinton. I really believe a lot of those people are coming over and largely because of trade, college education, lots of other things--but largely because of trade, they're coming over to our side--you watch, you watch. Especially after Hillary mocks him and mocks all of those people by attacking him and his supporters as 'living in their parents' basements,' and trapped in dead-end careers. That's not what they are.Also in his speech on Saturday night, Trump summed up exactly what came out in the latest Hillary Clinton tapes in which she mocks Sanders supporters:She describes many of them as ignorant, and [that] they want the United States to be more like Scandinavia but that 'half the people don't know what that means' in a really sarcastic tone because she's a sarcastic woman. To sum up, and I'll tell you the other thing--she's an incompetent woman. She's an incompetent woman. I've seen it. Just take a look at what she touches. It never works out, and you watch: her run for the presidency will never ever work out because we can't let it work out. To sum up, Hillary Clinton thinks Bernie supporters are hopeless and ignorant basement dwellers. Then, of course, she thinks people who vote for and follow us are deplorable and irredeemable. I don't think so. I don't think so. We have the smartest people, we have the sharpest people, we have the most amazing people, and you know in all of the years of this country they say, even the pundits--most of them aren't worth the ground they're standing on, some of that ground could be fairly wealthy but ground, but most of these people say they have never seen a phenomenon like is going on. We have crowds like this wherever we go.WATCH THE FULL SPEECH:Later in the speech, Trump came back to the tape again and hammered her once more for it.
""Hillary Clinton all but said that most of the country is racist, including the men and women of law enforcement,"" Trump said. ""She said that the other night. Did anybody like Lester Holt? Did anybody question her when she said that? No, she said it the other night. [If] you're not a die hard Clinton fan--you're not a supporter--from Day One, Hillary Clinton thinks you are a defective person. That's what she's going around saying.""In the speech, Trump questioned whether Clinton has the moral authority to lead when she considers the majority of Americans--Trump supporters and Sanders supporters--to be ""defective"" people. And he went so far as saying that Clinton ""should be in prison."" He went on:How on earth can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has nothing but contempt for the people who live in this country? She's got contempt. First of all, she's got so many scandals and she's been caught cheating so much. One of the worst things I've ever witnessed as a citizen of the United States was last week when the FBI director was trying so hard to explain how she away with what she got away with, because she should be in prison. Let me tell you. She should be in prison. She's being totally protected by the New York Times and the Washington Post and all of the media and CNN--Clinton News Network--which nobody is watching anyway so what difference does it make? Don't even watch it. But she's being protected by many of these groups. It's not like do you think she's guilty? They've actually admitted she's guilty. And then she lies and lies, 33,000 emails deleted, bleached, acid-washed! And then they take their phones and they hammer the hell out of them. How many people have acid washed or bleached a Tweet? How many?He returned to the secret Clinton tape a little while later:Hillary Clinton slanders and attacks anyone who wants to put America First, whether they are Trump Voters or Bernie Voters. What she said about Bernie voters amazing. Like the European Union, she wants to erase our borders and she wants to do it for her donors and she wants people to pour into country without knowing who they are.Trump later bashed the media as ""dishonest as hell"" when calling on the reporters at his event to ""turn your cameras"" to show the crowd that came to see him.""If they showed the kind of crowds we have--which people can hear, you know it's interesting: you can hear the crowd when you hear the television but if they showed the crowd it would be better television, but they don't know much about that. But it would actually be better television,"" Trump said.Trump also questioned whether Hillary Clinton has been loyal to her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton has been known to cheat on Hillary Clinton with a variety of mistresses and has been accused of rape and sexual assault by some women.""Hillary Clinton's only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself,"" Trump said. ""I don't even think she's loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. And really, folks, really: Why should she be, right? Why should she be?""Throughout the speech, Trump weaved together references to his new campaign theme about Clinton--""Follow The Money""--with details about the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. He said:We're going to take on the corrupt media, the powerful lobbyists and the special interests that have stolen your jobs, your factories, and your future--that's exactly what's happened. We're going to stop Hillary Clinton from continuing to raid the industry from your state for her profit. Hillary Clinton has collected millions of dollars from the same global corporations shipping your jobs and your dreams to other countries. You know it and everybody else knows it. That's why Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100 percent approve Trans Pacific Partnership--a total disastrous trade deal. She called the deal the 'gold standard.' The TPP will bring economic devastation to Pennsylvania and our campaign is the only chance to stop that and other bad things that are happening to our country. She lied about the Gold Standard the other night at the debate. She said she didn't say it--she said it. We want to stop the Trans Pacific Partnership and if we don't--remember this, if we don't stop it, billions and billions [of dollars] in jobs and wealth will be vacuumed right out of Pennsylvania and sent to these other countries. Just like NAFTA was a disaster, this will be a disaster. Frankly I don't think it'll be as bad as NAFTA. It can't get any worse than that--signed by Bill Clinton. All of us here in this massive room here tonight can prevent this from happening. Together we can stop TPP and we can end the theft of American jobs and prosperity.Trump praised Sanders for being strongly opposed to the TPP:I knew one man--I'm not a big fan--but one man who knew the dangers of the TPP was Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. He was right about one thing, only one thing, and that was trade. He was right about it because he knew we were getting ripped off, but he wouldn't be able to do anything about it. We're going to do a lot about it. We're going to have those highways running the opposite direction. We're going to have a lot of trade, but it's going to come into our country. We are going to start benefitting our country because right now it's one way road to trouble. Our jobs leave us, our money leaves us. With Mexico, we get the drugs--they get the cash--it's that simple.Hillary Clinton, Trump noted, is ""controlled by global special interests.""""She's on the opposite side of Bernie on the trade issue,"" Trump said. ""She's totally on the opposite side of Bernie.""He circled back to trade a bit later in the more-than-hour-long speech, hammering TPP and Clinton cash connections. Trump continued:Three TPP member countries gave between $6 and $15 million to Clinton. At least four lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign. I'm just telling you Pennsylvania, we're going to make it. We're going to make it. We're going to make it if we have Pennsylvania for sure. It'll be easy. But you cannot let this pass. NAFTA passed. It's been the worst trade deal probably ever passed, not in this country but anywhere in the world. It cleaned out New England. It cleaned out big portions of Pennsylvania. It cleaned out big portions of Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina--you can't let it happen.Trump even called the politicians like Clinton ""bloodsuckers"" who have let America be drained out of millions upon millions of jobs.""These bloodsuckers want it to happen,"" Trump said. ""They're politicians that are getting taken care of by people that want it to happen. Other countries want it to happen because it's good for them, but it's not good for us. So hopefully you're not going to let it happen. Whatever Hillary's donors want, they get. They own her. On Nov. 8, we're going to end Clinton corruption. Hillary Clinton, dishonest person, is an insider fighting for herself and for her friends. I'm an outsider fighting for you. And by the way, just in case you're not aware, I used to be an insider but I thought this was the right thing to do. This is the right thing to do, believe me.""
A new audio tape that has surfaced just yesterday from another one of Hillary's high roller fundraisers shows her demeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. You know, and I'll tell you something we have a much bigger movement that Bernie Sanders ever had. We have much bigger crowds than Sanders ever had.

We're going to stop Hillary Clinton from continuing to raid the industry from your state for her profit. Hillary Clinton has collected millions of dollars from the same global corporations shipping your jobs and your dreams to other countries. You know it and everybody else knows it. That's why Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100 percent approve Trans Pacific Partnership--a total disastrous trade deal. She called the deal the 'gold standard.' The TPP will bring economic devastation to Pennsylvania and our campaign is the only chance to stop that and other bad things that are happening to our country. She lied about the Gold Standard the other night at the debate. She said she didn't say it--she said it. We want to stop the Trans Pacific Partnership and if we don't--remember this, if we don't stop it, billions and billions [of dollars] in jobs and wealth will be vacuumed right out of Pennsylvania and sent to these other countries. Just like NAFTA was a disaster, this will be a disaster. Frankly I don't think it'll be as bad as NAFTA. It can't get any worse than that--signed by Bill Clinton. All of us here in this massive room here tonight can prevent this from happening. Together we can stop TPP and we can end the theft of American jobs and prosperity.

I knew one man--I'm not a big fan--but one man who knew the dangers of the TPP was Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. He was right about one thing, only one thing, and that was trade. He was right about it because he knew we were getting ripped off, but he wouldn't be able to do anything about it. We're going to do a lot about it. We're going to have those highways running the opposite direction. We're going to have a lot of trade, but it's going to come into our country. We are going to start benefitting our country because right now it's one way road to trouble. Our jobs leave us, our money leaves us. With Mexico, we get the drugs--they get the cash--it's that simple.

Three TPP member countries gave between $6 and $15 million to Clinton. At least four lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign. I'm just telling you Pennsylvania, we're going to make it. We're going to make it. We're going to make it if we have Pennsylvania for sure. It'll be easy. But you cannot let this pass. NAFTA passed. It's been the worst trade deal probably ever passed, not in this country but anywhere in the world. It cleaned out New England. It cleaned out big portions of Pennsylvania. It cleaned out big portions of Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina--you can't let it happen.
SIGN UPNEW YORK CITY, New York -- In a lengthy speech on Saturday night in Manheim, Pennsylvania, Republican nominee for president Donald J. Trump lambasted his opponent Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton for a secret tape recording of her bashing supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont--and even called for Clinton to be placed in prison and questioned as to whether she has been loyal to her husband former President Bill Clinton.Trump said in the speech on Saturday night:A new audio tape that has surfaced just yesterday from another one of Hillary's high roller fundraisers shows her demeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. You know, and I'll tell you something we have a much bigger movement that Bernie Sanders ever had. We have much bigger crowds than Sanders ever had. And we have a more important movement than Bernie Sanders ever had because we're going to save our country, okay? We're going to save our country. But I can tell you Bernie Sanders would have left a great, great legacy had he not made the deal with the devil. He would have really left a great legacy. Now he shows up and 120 people come in to hear him talk. Bernie Sanders would have left a great legacy had he not made the deal, had he held his head high and walked away. Now he's on the other side perhaps from us and we want to get along with everybody and we will--we're going to unite the country--but what Bernie Sanders did to his supporters was very, very unfair. And they're really not his supporters any longer and they're not going to support Hillary Clinton. I really believe a lot of those people are coming over and largely because of trade, college education, lots of other things--but largely because of trade, they're coming over to our side--you watch, you watch. Especially after Hillary mocks him and mocks all of those people by attacking him and his supporters as 'living in their parents' basements,' and trapped in dead-end careers. That's not what they are.Also in his speech on Saturday night, Trump summed up exactly what came out in the latest Hillary Clinton tapes in which she mocks Sanders supporters:She describes many of them as ignorant, and [that] they want the United States to be more like Scandinavia but that 'half the people don't know what that means' in a really sarcastic tone because she's a sarcastic woman. To sum up, and I'll tell you the other thing--she's an incompetent woman. She's an incompetent woman. I've seen it. Just take a look at what she touches. It never works out, and you watch: her run for the presidency will never ever work out because we can't let it work out. To sum up, Hillary Clinton thinks Bernie supporters are hopeless and ignorant basement dwellers. Then, of course, she thinks people who vote for and follow us are deplorable and irredeemable. I don't think so. I don't think so. We have the smartest people, we have the sharpest people, we have the most amazing people, and you know in all of the years of this country they say, even the pundits--most of them aren't worth the ground they're standing on, some of that ground could be fairly wealthy but ground, but most of these people say they have never seen a phenomenon like is going on. We have crowds like this wherever we go.WATCH THE FULL SPEECH:Later in the speech, Trump came back to the tape again and hammered her once more for it.
""Hillary Clinton all but said that most of the country is racist, including the men and women of law enforcement,"" Trump said. ""She said that the other night. Did anybody like Lester Holt? Did anybody question her when she said that? No, she said it the other night. [If] you're not a die hard Clinton fan--you're not a supporter--from Day One, Hillary Clinton thinks you are a defective person. That's what she's going around saying.""In the speech, Trump questioned whether Clinton has the moral authority to lead when she considers the majority of Americans--Trump supporters and Sanders supporters--to be ""defective"" people. And he went so far as saying that Clinton ""should be in prison."" He went on:How on earth can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has nothing but contempt for the people who live in this country? She's got contempt. First of all, she's got so many scandals and she's been caught cheating so much. One of the worst things I've ever witnessed as a citizen of the United States was last week when the FBI director was trying so hard to explain how she away with what she got away with, because she should be in prison. Let me tell you. She should be in prison. She's being totally protected by the New York Times and the Washington Post and all of the media and CNN--Clinton News Network--which nobody is watching anyway so what difference does it make? Don't even watch it. But she's being protected by many of these groups. It's not like do you think she's guilty? They've actually admitted she's guilty. And then she lies and lies, 33,000 emails deleted, bleached, acid-washed! And then they take their phones and they hammer the hell out of them. How many people have acid washed or bleached a Tweet? How many?He returned to the secret Clinton tape a little while later:Hillary Clinton slanders and attacks anyone who wants to put America First, whether they are Trump Voters or Bernie Voters. What she said about Bernie voters amazing. Like the European Union, she wants to erase our borders and she wants to do it for her donors and she wants people to pour into country without knowing who they are.Trump later bashed the media as ""dishonest as hell"" when calling on the reporters at his event to ""turn your cameras"" to show the crowd that came to see him.""If they showed the kind of crowds we have--which people can hear, you know it's interesting: you can hear the crowd when you hear the television but if they showed the crowd it would be better television, but they don't know much about that. But it would actually be better television,"" Trump said.Trump also questioned whether Hillary Clinton has been loyal to her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton has been known to cheat on Hillary Clinton with a variety of mistresses and has been accused of rape and sexual assault by some women.""Hillary Clinton's only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself,"" Trump said. ""I don't even think she's loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. And really, folks, really: Why should she be, right? Why should she be?""Throughout the speech, Trump weaved together references to his new campaign theme about Clinton--""Follow The Money""--with details about the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. He said:We're going to take on the corrupt media, the powerful lobbyists and the special interests that have stolen your jobs, your factories, and your future--that's exactly what's happened. We're going to stop Hillary Clinton from continuing to raid the industry from your state for her profit. Hillary Clinton has collected millions of dollars from the same global corporations shipping your jobs and your dreams to other countries. You know it and everybody else knows it.

All of us here in this massive room here tonight can prevent this from happening. Together we can stop TPP and we can end the theft of American jobs and prosperity.Trump praised Sanders for being strongly opposed to the TPP:I knew one man--I'm not a big fan--but one man who knew the dangers of the TPP was Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. He was right about one thing, only one thing, and that was trade. He was right about it because he knew we were getting ripped off, but he wouldn't be able to do anything about it. We're going to do a lot about it. We're going to have those highways running the opposite direction. We're going to have a lot of trade, but it's going to come into our country. We are going to start benefitting our country because right now it's one way road to trouble. Our jobs leave us, our money leaves us. With Mexico, we get the drugs--they get the cash--it's that simple.Hillary Clinton, Trump noted, is ""controlled by global special interests.""""She's on the opposite side of Bernie on the trade issue,"" Trump said. ""She's totally on the opposite side of Bernie.""He circled back to trade a bit later in the more-than-hour-long speech, hammering TPP and Clinton cash connections. Trump continued:Three TPP member countries gave between $6 and $15 million to Clinton. At least four lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign. I'm just telling you Pennsylvania, we're going to make it. We're going to make it.

It's been the worst trade deal probably ever passed, not in this country but anywhere in the world. It cleaned out New England. It cleaned out big portions of Pennsylvania. It cleaned out big portions of Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina--you can't let it happen.Trump even called the politicians like Clinton ""bloodsuckers"" who have let America be drained out of millions upon millions of jobs.""These bloodsuckers want it to happen,"" Trump said. ""They're politicians that are getting taken care of by people that want it to happen. Other countries want it to happen because it's good for them, but it's not good for us. So hopefully you're not going to let it happen. Whatever Hillary's donors want, they get. They own her. On Nov. 8, we're going to end Clinton corruption. Hillary Clinton, dishonest person, is an insider fighting for herself and for her friends. I'm an outsider fighting for you. And by the way, just in case you're not aware, I used to be an insider but I thought this was the right thing to do. This is the right thing to do, believe me."""

Nonetheless, the students later admitted they had made the incident up after hearing about other cases on the Internet.But, that's not keeping the police chief from taking the matter seriously.""If there is someone out there that thinks this is some type of fun prank that gives you attention you so strive, let me warn you now, that if you do ANYTHING that disrupts the safe learning environment for our kids, we will find you and charge you criminally with all of the laws at our disposal up to and including terrorizing,"" Lentz wrote in his public message on Facebook.""We are not clowning around,"" Lentz ended the message.Months ago, nearly 30 children living in an apartment complex told police officials in South Carolina that they had spotted clowns enticing them to go into the woods.Then, just weeks ago, Breitbart News reported an incident where a man dressed as a clown had traveled across multiple states, threatening to abduct children from schools specifically in Georgia.In Louisiana, there have been no credible reports by law enforcement officials of clowns luring children into woods.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Comey responded that the FBI is ""still working on it,"" but that it looks like Dahir Ahmed Adan, 20, appears to have been motivated ""by some sort of inspiration from radical Islamic groups.""He said investigators are not yet sure which groups may have inspired Adan or how, adding that investigators still are reviewing Adan's electronics.Minneapolis FBI spokesman Jeff Van Nest declined to elaborate on Comey's comments when reached by phone Wednesday. He said he'd let the FBI director's statement speak for itself.Dahir Adan was originally resettled as a refugee in Fargo, North Dakota in the 1990s, along with his father, Ahmed Adan, and, presumably, other members of his family, according to Valley News Live, the NBC television affiliate in Fargo.Subsequently, Dahir Adan and his father moved from Fargo to St. Cloud, Minnesota, where he graduated from Apollo High School in 2015.Adan's brother, Abdullahi, who claims a St. Cloud, Minnesota residence, is currently in a jail in Fargo, North Dakota on drug charges with an ICE detainer. He and ""Semereab Tesfaye, 25, of Fargo were charged with Class A felonies and were booked into the Burleigh County Detention Center,"" in November ""after a North Dakota Highway Patrol trooper stopped their red Mazda sedan on Interstate 94 for a traffic violation. A search of their vehicle yielded 1.75 pounds of marijuana and $1,400 cash.""Abdullahi Adan is appealing that arrest to the North Dakota Supreme Court. He was subsequently released on bond, but in June was arrested again in Fargo on drug charges, the same month his younger brother Dahir quit his security guard job with a company called Securitas in St. Cloud.Ninety-seven thousand three hundred and eighty-five Somali refugees have been resettled in the United States in the fifteen years since FY 2002, of which 15,710 were resettled in Minnesota, more than any other state in the country, according to the Department of State's interactive website.Trailing Minnesota in the top ten states for Somali refugee resettlement since FY 2002 are Ohio (7,551), Texas (7,195), New York (6,169), Arizona (5,682), Georgia (4,113), California (3,731), Missouri (3,246), Massachusetts (3,156), and Tennessee (2,958).Minnesota also leads the country in the number of Somali refugees resettled over these fifteen years on a per capita basis, with 286.2 Somali refugees resettled per 100,000 residents of the state. (The state's 2015 population was 5.5 million).Only two states come close to Minnesota's per capita Somali refugee resettlement number: North Dakota and Maine.North Dakota experienced a 131.7 Somali refugee resettlement rate per 100,000 residents (997 refugees over fifteen years in a state with a 2015 population of 756,927).Maine experienced a 117.9 Somali refugee resettlement rate per 100,000 residents (1,568 refugees over fifteen years in a state with a 2015 population of 1.3 million).""Minnesota has the nation's largest Somali community, with census numbers placing the population at about 57,000,"" the Associated Press reported:Young Somalis have been a target for terror recruiters. Since 2007, more than 20 young men have joined the militant group al-Shabab in Somalia. In addition, roughly a dozen people have left to join militants in Syria, and nine Minnesota men face sentencing on terror charges for plotting to join the Islamic State group.Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Florida Republican, asked Comey if Minnesota was the top source of U.S. fighters for the Islamic State group. Comey said he wasn't sure, but that this ""sounds about right.""Comey said he suspects one reason is because Minnesota is one of the few areas in the country with a large concentration of people who may be susceptible to terror recruiting. Still, he said, the number is small, noting there aren't many Islamic State fighters from the U.S.Stopping recruiting has been a high priority in Minnesota, with law enforcement investing countless hours in community outreach and the state participating in a federal project designed to combat radical messages.""National Review's Ian Tuttle visited Minneapolis's Somali community and described the problems of a refugee policy that eschews assimilation,' "" John Fonte wrote recently at National Review in an article titled ""The Obama-Clinton Immigration Agenda Will Mean the Balkanization of America.""Tuttle reported that the ""self-ghettoized"" Somali community exists ""in tension with its adopted home."" He noted the ""terror problem"" this tension has caused, as ""more than 60 young [American-born] Somali men and women have left Minnesota to join"" Islamist terrorist groups.Issues surrounding terrorism and ""radicalization in communities"" are of concern in neighboring North Dakota as well.In July, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) ""announced federal funds available to help local communities counter violent extremism by building bridges and encouraging dialogue."":To make sure towns across North Dakota and the country remain strong and safe, we need to be tough and smart on terrorism to prevent radicalization in communities.

The center was formerly called the United Somali Women of Maine.Maine U.S. Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins say the immigration resource center will create, maintain and expand sexual assault services for East African sexual assault victims who live in southern Maine.The senators say the money will help provide culturally specific services to ensure that members of Maine's East African community have support and education about sexual assault and domestic violence.In light of FBI Director Comey's statement that Somali refugee Dahir Adan's attack in the St. Cloud, Minnesota mall was motivated ""by some sort of inspiration from radical Islamic groups,"" it is not surprising that trouble in the Somali refugee community in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Maine, the three states with the highest per capita rates of Somali refugee resettlement, has caught the attention of federal lawmakers from those states.While testifying for hours before the House Judiciary Committee in Washington, Comey was asked whether authorities had confirmed that the attack earlier this month in a mall in St. Cloud was an act of terrorism.
