Stein explained that the reason they do so is ""because they're huge donors to her foundation.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERStein put members of corporate media, who have failed to cover her own ""people-powered campaign,"" on notice, declaring, ""Your silence to our voices speaks volumes.""""Why does the corporate media prop up Hillary and smear her opponents? Because they're huge donors to her foundation,"" Stein wrote on Twitter, linking to a Politico report titled, ""Clinton Foundation Donors Include Dozens of Media Organizations, Individuals"".""90% of the US media is controlled by 6 corporations.

The donations, which range from the low-thousands to the millions, provide a picture of the media industry's ties to the Clinton Foundation at a time when one of its most notable personalities, George Stephanopoulos, is under scrutiny for not disclosing his own $75,000 contribution when reporting on the foundation. The list also includes mass media groups like Comcast, Time Warner and Viacom, as well a few notable individuals, including Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecom magnate and largest shareholder of The New York Times Company, and James Murdoch, the chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox. Both Slim and Murdoch have given between $1 million to $5 million, respectively.Stein has repeatedly attacked ""corporate media"" for not covering her campaign-a campaign, which, she says, presents voters with a clear alternative to Washington's corporatist ""uniparty.""Indeed, while third party Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson has received quite a bit of media attention throughout this election, Stein says that she has experienced a virtual media ""blackout."" Stein has suggested that the reason for the media blackout is that, unlike Johnson, she is an effective messenger against Washington's ""uniparty.""""Despite a near-blackout by corporate media we are reaching millions of Americans who are ready to build a new major party,"" Stein wrote.Help us #BreakTheBlackout from corporate media - go to https://t.co/XKgRNM7Pa9 and sign up to join our team! #GreenTownHall-- Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) October 12, 2016 Who is the #debate media blackout really hurting?

One officer faced additional surgery on Saturday morning. Police say the two officers are recovering but are still in critical condition.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBoston Police Officers Richard Cintolo, a 27-year police veteran, and Matt Morris, a 12-year veteran responded to a domestic disturbance call on Wednesday night. Police officials say that Kirk Figueroa, 33, was reported to be threatening his roommate with a knife, Breitbart Texas reported on Wednesday.When the officers arrived and entered the home, Figueroa reportedly appeared with a tactical shotgun and wearing body armor. He opened fire, striking one officer in the leg and the other in the upper body. Other officers responded quickly and dragged the two wounded officers to a safe place were life-saving first aid could be applied. Other officers returned fire, striking and killing Figueroa.The officers were transported to the hospital, but officials credited the quick action of a fellow officer who stuck his finger in the leg wound of Officer Morris, pinching off the severed femoral artery. Another officer applied a tourniquet allowing Morris to be safely transported. Both officers underwent surgery on Wednesday but were listed in ""extremely critical"" condition at that time.Following a second round of surgery on Friday, police told the Associated Press (AP) the officers were recovering but were still in critical condition.Boston police officials tweeted that Morris underwent additional surgery on Saturday morning. The surgery was completed and Morris is listed in critical but stable condition.Both officers remain in critical but stable condition at this time.

(@bostonpolice) October 15, 2016The AP reported that Officer Morris received the state's highest award for bravery, the Hanna Medal of Honor, for his actions in 2006 when he and his partner talked down a masked gunman who was firing on a crowded bus. The two officers were able to peacefully take the man into custody and save those on the bus.The Boston Herald reported that Officer Cintolo has been described as ""the guy you want to be pulled over by.""""If there was a bird on the ground, he'd stop the cruiser and push the bird to the side of the road,"" Mike Anderson, the service manager of Nu-Tread Tire & Auto Service Center in Eastie's Orient Heights neighborhood told the local newspaper., Anderson said Cintolo would frequently stop by his East Boston home.Cintolo is a second generation Boston police officer.

AG Ken Paxton urges that ""Both the law and sound public policy against the chilling of protected speech demand dismissal of Waller County's claim. He also urges that the Waller County court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBreitbart Texas has been following the controversy and the protests by Second Amendment advocates over the right for concealed handgun license holders to have guns in a government building. The Waller County, Texas complex houses courtrooms and judicial chambers and court staff offices as well as the County Clerk Office and other county offices.Officials for Waller County urge that the courthouse is legally off-limits to licensed gun holders. They say allowing citizens to carry inside the courthouse in violation of state law is dangerous because it subjects witnesses and litigants, judges, lawyers, prosecutors, peace officers and others, ""to an unnecessary and unjustifiable risk."" District Attorney Elton Mathis told Breitbart Texas, ""The commissioners court is adamant that guns will not come in the courthouse."" The District Attorney said his clients, the officials in the county, do not believe that the Texas Legislature has intended the ""sweeping interpretation"" that the Second Amendment advocates are giving it.Waller County filed a lawsuit against San Jacinto County resident Terry Holcomb Sr., founder of Texas Carry. Holcomb sent the County a notice complaining that county officials were in violation of Texas law by excluding licensed to carry (LTC) holders, as reported by Breitbart Texas.D.A. Mathis says the new law that allows LTC holders to carry in government buildings and around courthouses needs to be legally interpreted in the court system. The County sued Holcomb in order to have the rights and duties under Texas law legally declared by a judge. ""All Texans should welcome this resolution,"" he said. Waller County's lawsuit states that the issue is whether signs posted at courthouses violate section 411.209 of the Government Code. Section 46.03(a) of the Texas Penal Code prohibits an individual from entering a courthouse carrying a prohibited weapon or firearm. The petition states that a related question is whether this Penal Code section ""prohibits an individual from carrying firearms and other weapons throughout the entire building in which a court or court office is located or only in an actual courtroom or court office.""Section 411.209 prohibits state agencies and political subdivisions from wrongfully excluding handgun license holders from property owned or leased by the government. The law prohibits a governmental entity from providing notice by a communication described in Texas Penal Code SS 30.06, or by any sign expressly referring to that law or to a concealed handgun license, that a license holder carrying a handgun is prohibited from entering or remaining on a premises or other place owned or leased by the governmental entity unless the license holder is prohibited from carrying a handgun on the premises or other place by Texas Penal Code SSSS 46.03 or 46.035.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton writes in his amicus curiae brief (Latin for ""friend of the court""), ""Allowing this suit-in which the County has sued a citizen based on lawful exercise of his right to grieve-to proceed is an affront to the constitutional rights afforded by The Texas Constitution and will not resolve the County's liability under SS 411.209. The Court should dismiss the County's claim for lack of jurisdiction.""Breitbart Texas was in Waller County when gun rights advocates descended on Waller County in August to support their fellow Second Amendment advocate after he was sued by the County. During the open carry protest, they went to the Waller County Clerk's Office to file their own complaints against the County. A video of them bringing their complaints to the County Clerk is included in the article.Right before the protest, Texas Attorney General (AG) Ken Paxton sent Waller County officials a notice that they were in violation of the law. The AG gave county officials 15 days to cure the violation and put it on notice that the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) may file suit and seek $1,000 - $1,500 for the first violation, and not less than $10,000 - $10,500 for any second and subsequent violation. Each continuing day constitutes a separate violation under Texas law. As reported by Breitbart Texas, the AG filed a lawsuit on August 29th in Travis County, Texas. Austin, the State Capital, is in Travis County.The Attorney General argues in his brief that the Travis County district court in which the AG has filed suit ""is where Waller County's liability, or exemption therefrom, will be determined.""Holcomb told Breitbart Texas after the AG filed the amicus brief, ""We are very pleased that Attorney General Ken Paxton has taken such a strong stand against this bully of a County Judge. It's obvious he is used to simply running over people. This is a blatant violation of our very basic right to redress our grievances with the government.""The Texas Carry founder said he will litigate all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. He argues that if they do not do so, it could encourage ""anti-gun officials"" who want to silence the voices of gun owners defending their Second Amendment rights.Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

By 2040, they expect to see explosive population growth.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERACBJ, the parent company of the Dallas Business Journal, generated these statistics for 933 metro and micropolitan regions based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the University of Virginia's Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service.Of those Texas cities on the Top 10 list of America's fastest growing metros, Austin came in first place. ACBJ foresees the Austin-Round Rock area to nearly double its population from two million to four million in the next 24 years. This reflects a 98.5 percent increase in residents. Although Austin is poised to become the fastest growing U.S. city, it is not the largest. Following Austin on the list were Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land (5), San Antonio-New Braunfels (6), Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington (7), and McAllen-Edinburg-Mission (10).Two of the Top 10 fastest growing cities in the country were in Florida -- Cape Coral-Fort Meyers (2) and Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford (4). Raleigh, NC (3), Charleston-North Charleston, SC (8), and Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO (9) also made the list.Within Texas, Houston just may overtake Dallas as the state's largest metropolis in 2040. Currently, 7.1 million people reside in Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington (DFW). The Dallas Business Journal reported DFW could swell to 10.9 million people, a 53.5 percent population increase. However, the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land population should balloon to 11.1 million, up 66.7 percent from its current 6.6 million.In March, the U.S. Census Bureau released figures tracking the Texas population boom fueled by nearly half a million people relocating to the Lone Star State over the one year period of July 2014 to July 2015. That is more than any other state in the nation. Statistical growth patterns in that report, lead by Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land and closely followed by DFW, mirror ACBJ's projections.According to ACBJ, smaller Texas cities like McAllen-Edinburg-Mission may see its population jump 51.3 percent by 2040. The area's roughly 842,000 population could soar to 1.275 million. El Paso should experience a 17.5 percent uptick from 839,000 to 985,476 residents. Midland could have a 75 percent growth spurt, jumping from today's 167,000 residents to nearly 300,000. Odessa is poised for 67.4 percent growth. Its population will grow from around 159,400 to 266,860.Nationally, ACBJ expects New York City to remain the most populated large metro area in 2040, even though Los Angeles grows at a faster pace. The Big Apple will have 22.5 million city dwellers while Tinseltown, in second place, may only reach 15 million. Houston and Dallas will take the third and fourth spots, respectively. Chicago, with 9.7 million residents today, will likely drop to fifth place. ACBJ also anticipates Philadelphia, currently seventh, will sink to 11th place by 2040. Phoenix, and California's San Francisco-Oakland and Riverside-San Bernardino will surpass Boston, now in 10th place and expected to drop to 13th.Demographers called Myrtle Beach, SC, the hottest growth prospect in smaller cities with 500,000-999,999 residents in 2040. They estimate the city will expand by over 85 percent to a population of 800,000.Earlier in October, WalletHub named DFW suburb Frisco the nation's fastest growing mid-size U.S. city with 154,407 residents. The upscale sprawling urban community is home to the Dallas Cowboys corporate headquarters and state-of-the-art practice facility called the Star, an estimated $1.5 billion venue on a 91-acre compound that boasts two outdoor practice fields, underground parking, plans for an Omni hotel hotel, retail, and a Baylor, Scott & White sports therapy research center. It opened in late August. California companies like Jamba Juice and Toyota transplanted their headquarters to Frisco. The Japanese automaker's massive 100-acre campus expects to be operational mid-2017. In May, Breitbart Texas reported Frisco was one of five Texas midsize cities to rank on the nation's fastest growing between 2014-15.Last year, Breitbart Texas reported on a study released by the Office of the State Demographer. It predicted if migration patterns continued on the same pace as in 2000 to 2010, Texas would see explosive population growth - up to 54.4 million people, based on immigration and migration patterns as people continue to pour in from other U.S. states.Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.SIGN UP	['Cooper']	[]

""As long as Trump can bring his message of change straight to the people, I think you're going to see more black people voting for Trump than have voted for a Republican presidential nominee in decades.""For years, at Tampa's Glory to Glory Church, Bishop Shines has brought his brand of God's gospel to millions of people. His strident political advocacy for Trump, he says, is rooted in the proud history of the Republican party and starts with educating voters on the hidden history of the Democratic party.""I ask people to ask themselves a question: are you better off after having supported the Democratic party that has given you slavery?"" Shines says. ""Are you comfortable, blacks and Latinos particularly, in knowing that you have been part of a political party that has a legacy of lynching, the KKK, Jim Crow laws? Or are you just not aware of these facts?""Last month, Shines produced a powerful and provocative video exposing the Democratic party's unsavory history on civil rights and much more. The video, titled, ""Black Pastors Do Not Support Hillary Clinton,"" features quotes from people who've shaped the Democratic Party and those who've influenced its 2016 presidential nominee.Shines says now that he's created the video, he's looking to leverage faith leaders and social media to amass a new generation of conservative converts.Speaking candidly, Shines said the video is meant to ask ""my white Christian brothers and sisters and my white faith leaders a question: are you comfortable knowing that every time you vote for a Democrat, you're voting for a party that believes in the abortion and genocide of an entire ethnicity?""Indeed, there are more than 20 comprehensive healthcare clinics for every 1 Planned Parenthood facility. And, according to a map published by Breitbart News that shows many Planned Parenthood facilities within walking distance of black and Latino neighborhoods, it's no surprise that non-Hispanic black women who made up about 6.6 percent of the population accounted for 35.7 percent of the abortions performed in 2010.""If they are not aware of their party's horrid racial history, that's one thing,"" Shines said. ""But to know the Democratic party's history of slavery and their current support of abortion and black genocide, calls into question whether they understand what being an American is all about. As Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King put it, that type of infanticide and barbaric behavior is something that shouldn't be supported by anyone.""One of the few black faith leaders publicly supporting Trump, Bishop Shines said his support for the White House hopeful ""was never a question.""""Once Trump became the Republican nominee, I was going to vote for the party's candidate,"" he said.""I'm not blind to some of the personal challenges and some of the positions that Trump has held in the past, that were not in keeping with conservatism,"" Shines said. ""However, the moment that Trump explained his position on Supreme Court justices and federal judges and said here's where I stand on school choice, etc., I don't know why it's taken any elected Republican as long as it has to endorse his candidacy.""Trump faced a barrage of criticism last week over lewd remarks he made about women in a caught-on-tape conversation in 2005 with former Access Hollywood anchor Billy Bush.Trump apologized for his comments, but not before a bevy of establishment Republicans withdrew their support of his candidacy and demanded he leave the presidential race.Shines says, simply, ""shame on those Republicans abandoning Trump.""""Shame on them. I look at some of the congressmen and senators and governors who have pulled their support of Trump following the fallout from his hot mic remarks, and I think their abandonment is deplorable and despicable,"" Shines said.""They may not like Trump's politically incorrect tone,"" he continued, ""but the reality is we're not voting for a man, we're voting for a platform. When I look at the Republicans who've abandoned Trump, I think to myself, 'who's your second choice?' And if they really adhere to the Christian values of forgiveness -- and Trump has apologized and has said 'I was wrong' -- then why not forgive, instead of showing so much disdain for him?""Shines says the Republicans who've betrayed Trump for his transgressions rarely exhibit the same level of anger after they fail to stop legislation ""that wreaks havoc on America.""""Where is this moral outrage when they're passing bills that take our tax dollars to fund abortion and Planned Parenthood, and other legislation that wreaks havoc on America?"" Shines asked. ""Where was this same outrage when they failed their constituents after Obamacare passed? Sure, Obamacare is falling apart. But they could've saved the American people from this pain by defunding it. The House of Representatives has the power of the purse. They could've starved Obamacare. But they didn't want to look bad.""Shines continued: ""A group of clergy spoke about how repulsed they were at the comments Trump had made in 2005. I said, have we forgotten that the very business that we're in is to forgive and redeem those who, according to Hillary Clinton, are not redeemable? Trump, again, has asked for forgiveness. Who are we to deny him now?""So I think it's silly. I think it's childish,"" Shines said. ""I think it's very petulant, that so many of our leaders are not standing up with Donald Trump to make sure that we have a Republican president sitting in the Oval Office who will be able to governor as a conservative.""After entering the presidential race last June, Trump, beating out 16 other contenders, clenched the Republican party's presidential nomination in July.Shines says Trump can credit much of his meteoric rise to the top of the Republican presidential ticket to his unabashed willingness to call illegal immigration a gambit that betrays American workers -- and in doing so, he's embarrassed both the Republican establishment and the so-called civil rights community.""Illegal immigration matters a lot if you consider poverty among many black and Latino Americans,"" Shines said. ""Illegal immigration, and even President Obama has admitted this in the past, has caused increased unemployment in the black community.""Shines points to people like Peter Kirsanow, an official with the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, who's long-argued that illegal immigration has severely depressed the labor force participation rate of low-skilled black Americans, only to be routinely ignored by President Obama and the Congressional Black Caucus.""Granting work authorization to millions of illegal immigrants will devastate the black community, which is already struggling in the wake of the recession that began in 2007 and the subsequent years of malaise,"" Kirsanow wrote to Obama and the Congressional Black Caucus in 2014. ""Illegal immigration has a disparate impact on African-American men, because these men are disproportionately represented in the low-skilled labor force.""Shines contends that the president's past statements expose his current hypocrisy on illegal immigration.""Obama himself talked about the straining of the social safety net and the added burden illegal immigration places on the welfare system,"" Shines said, referencing Obama's autobiography, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, where he lays out a strong case that illegal immigration suppresses wages.""There's no denying that many blacks share the same anxieties as many whites about the wave of illegal immigration flooding our Southern border--a sense that what's happening now is fundamentally different from what has gone on before,"" then-Senator Obama wrote in his 2006 autobiography.""The number of immigrants added to the labor force every year is of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century,"" Obama wrote. ""If this huge influx of mostly low-skill workers provides some benefits to the economy as a whole--especially by keeping our workforce young, in contrast to an increasingly geriatric Europe and Japan--it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue-collar Americans and put strains on an already overburdened safety net.""Shines says, ""under Obama, black unemployment has skyrocketed. Household median income, the wage gap"" are all going in the wrong direction.However, Shines' indictment of the Democratic party's failed social policies dates back decades.""The trillions of dollars in payments from various poverty programs that have trickled down to black people since the '60s, what has it gotten them?"" Shines asks. ""What do they have to show for it?""""Thanks to Democrats, black people, by and large, don't have school choice. But the majority of Congressional Black Caucus members send their children to private schools,"" Shines continued. ""Hillary Clinton sent her child to private school.""Roughly 70 percent of America's k-12 students attend ""assigned public schools."" What's more, recent public polling proves that black voters in several states strongly support school-choice and suggests that many minority voters favor the option to send their children to charter schools.""Again, Democrats don't want black parents to send their children to the school of their choosing,"" Shines said. ""That shouldn't be Hillary Clinton's decision to make.""""There's great irony in these Democratic party positions,"" he said. ""The same big government liberals who want to put a man in the bathroom stall standing next to our young daughters also wants to mandate where our children are educated.""""The Democratic Party is fractured, it's broken. The Republican party has the answers.""Bishop Shines believes Trump's candidacy has the potential to make history for the Republican party.""I know pastors that have never, ever voted for a Republican, who will be voting for Donald Trump."" Shines said. ""Why? They feel betrayed by Barack Obama. The president's push for same-sex marriage. These life-long Democratic voters have buyers remorse.

""That was when I realized exactly what this was: I realized it's the government against the people.""""As naive as I was then, I now know that politicians like Hillary are not out to do what's right for the people of America; they're out to do what's right for the people who donate money to them,"" Emmons said.""Hillary Clinton does not care about American working families. I don't believe she cares for any American,"" Emmons added. ""Even with all the issues regarding Trump's personal life, his stance on American workers is a thousand-fold better than Clinton's. ... Without a doubt, Donald Trump is the first presidential candidate that made me feel heard-that paid attention to working people.""""Working Americans are the ones that should really care [about this election],"" Emmons said. ""If you're a working American, Trump is the only person who is going to work for us.""The story of citizens like Mike Emmons and his colleagues has become an all-too-familiar one: American tech workers are gathered together for a meeting with their executives--in this case, by Siemens in Lake Mary, Florida, in 2002. The unsuspecting workers are then informed that, despite their stellar performance record and years of service to the company, they're all being fired and replaced by predominantly foreign-born Indian workers. However, before they are to be officially let go, they'll be forced to train their foreign replacements. If they refuse, the American workers will not receive their severance. Companies like Siemens, Disney, Southern California Edison, Xerox, Northeast Utilities, and countless others are able to do this through forming contracts with India-based outsourcing firms like Tata that import thousands of foreign workers into the country on L-1 and H-1B visas and use them to supplant American workers who had been working there previously.By all accounts from the workers who have dared to risk their future in the tech industry by speaking out, the experience of training their foreign replacement is nothing short of traumatic.One American worker, who wrote an op-ed for Breitbart News on the condition of anonymity, said he felt ""betrayed."" He spoke of the alienation he felt as he endured the ""humiliat[ing]"" and ""disgraceful"" experience of having no choice but ""to watch a foreign worker completely take over my job.""""Workers tell me that they feel physically sick as they're forced to train their replacements,"" said attorney Sara Blackwell, who runs an organization that represents high-skilled American workers replaced by low-wage foreign workers. ""They go home and vomit; they cry every single night; they go into counseling; they're admitted to hospitals; there are divorces; we've seen two suicides as a result of these cheap labor practices.""This business model, Blackwell said, ""has single-handedly destroyed American families by the thousands.""Emmons had a front row seat to the devastation.Although Emmons, as a contractor, was not formally displaced and was eventually able to land on his feet, he watched as some of his friends-unable to find new employment-were forced into early retirement. Others, far too young to retire, were forced to abandon their trade and leave the tech industry altogether-even though that meant letting years of specialized schooling and experience in the high-skilled sector go to waste. For many of those workers, their last opportunity to use the specialized skills they had spent decades cultivating was when they had to ""transfer"" that career's worth of knowledge to their lesser-skilled foreign replacements, who would work for a fraction of the cost.Emmons recalled one coworker, who after twenty years in the IT industry, was forced to go into landscaping to make ends meet.""The more I learned, the more upset I got,"" Emmons said. ""As a contractor, Siemens never trained me. They didn't pay me to train myself. I learned it all myself. And it upset me that I'm having to give away my hard-earned knowledge-an education and training, which I had paid for out of my own pocket so I could then train my replacements who were much less qualified.""Emmons' job was to be filled by-not one, but-three foreign workers, each of whom made a fraction of Emmons' salary and each of whom he had to train to ""learn a different facet of [his] job."" While Emmons made roughly $90,000 a year, he said the foreign workers' contract salary ultimately came out to roughly $1,000 a month.""It was the most demoralizing time of my life,"" Emmons said, who was concerned about how losing his job would affect his ability to care for his young daughter, who had been born with a serious medical disability. ""All I could think about is: how am I going to keep her insurance? It was about $930 a month at the time, which was almost the equivalent of [the foreign workers'] salary.""Emmons knew he couldn't sit by and watch. Instead, he launched what has been described as ""a ferocious one-man campaign against the practice of offshore outsourcing and supplanting American workers with foreigners on temporary work visas.""While still at Siemens, Emmons copied Tata's 800 documents on the Siemens shared drive and set up an encrypted tunnel between Siemens' server and his home server, so that he could communicate important information to the news media and expose what Tata was doing to American workers. Emmons' tireless efforts to bring attention to what was happening resulted in a local Orlando WKMG CBS expose and Emmy-nominated series, titled, Where Did the Jobs Go?Around that time, Emmons also reached out to the office of then-Senator Clinton seeking representation.""I sent her office reports, CDs, data. We had spoken over telephone and in written correspondence. We had emails going back and forth. I told her specifically about what Tata had done and how we had to train our replacements,"" Emmons said.""We Americans, just the normal Americans that work for a living need the help of Senator Clinton,"" Emmons wrote in a 2003 letter to Clinton congressional staffer, Erin Ashwell, an exclusive copy of which Breitbart News has obtained. ""She needs to realize what this company and many [Tata]-like companies from India are doing. They are just taking jobs from Americans. ... We desperately need help,"" Emmons wrote. Emmons told Clinton's office of his fears about how he would be unable to provide for his seven-year-old handicapped daughter, whose disability required expensive medical care. ""What are we supposed to do?"" Emmons wrote in his letter to Clinton's staffer. ""As a parent of a handicapped child, Hanna, born with spina bifida L4-5, all I wanted to do was pay my $930/month medical insurance premiums. Hanna is 7 years old and has had 8 surgeries.""""Please help stop these American Worker Replacement Programs,"" Emmons begged.Ultimately, however, ""Hillary didn't care,"" Emmons said. ""Hillary only cares about Hillary.""Emmons said Clinton not only ignored his repeated pleas, but she joined forces with Tata to help open a data systems office in Upstate New York.""About a month after I spoke to her office, Hillary went to Buffalo to get her pockets lined by Tata at their grand opening,"" Emmons explained.Indeed, as the Los Angeles Times reported at the time, Clinton's deal with Tata ""signaled that Clinton, who portrays herself as a fighter for American workers, had aligned herself with Indian American business leaders and Indian companies feared by the labor movement.""Making matters worse in Emmons' view, a press release issued by Tata announcing the opening revealed that the deal was, in fact, ""the brainchild of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.""In public, Clinton became a vocal champion of the Indian corporation, repeatedly defending the company's anti-American worker business model.Howard University Professor Ron Hira observed that during the ten-year period FY2005-2014, Tata imported an incredible 27,193 H-1B guest workers and likely more than 10,000 L-1 workers. That is tens of thousands of ""jobs that American workers should have been hired for or in many cases were already doing ... and got replaced"" by lower-wage foreign labor, Hira told Breitbart News.Interestingly, Tata has given tens of thousands of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. The Clintons also have financial ties to the India-based consulting firm responsible for the replacement of scores of American workers at Disney in Orlando, Florida.Yet Clinton's questionable financial and political ties to powerful Indian outsourcing corporations have received little media attention this election cycle. Emmons said he firmly believes that is because ""the mainstream media is totally in bed to get Clinton into office. The media are afraid of what Trump might do because he's not one of them,"" Emmons explained.Indeed, in 2007, Clinton's extensive ties to Indian donors, who support the outsourcing of American jobs and the insourcing of foreign labor to replace American workers, were thrust into national media spotlight following a hard-hitting memo issued by then-Senator Barack Obama's campaign.""It's all about the money,"" the Obama campaign wrote about Clinton's ties to India.In the memo, the Obama campaign labeled his opponent, ""Hillary Clinton (D-Punjab)""-implying that Clinton represents foreign nations and foreign citizens, rather than her own American constituents. The dig was a reference to a joke Clinton had previously made in which she told a group of Indian Americans that she saw herself as the elected representative of foreign citizens in the Indian region of Punjab. ""I am delighted to be the Senator from Punjab as well as from New York,"" Clinton said.""Hillary doesn't care about America,"" Emmons told Breitbart. ""She doesn't even really want us to be America. ... She wants a one-world government. That's all I can say. I can't comprehend why she takes all this money from foreign governments, or why she'd joke that she's 'the Senator of Punjab.'""The Clintons have repeatedly articulated their support for globalist policies, including ""open borders""-which Bernie Sanders has described as a radical position supported by wealthy donors that ""says essentially there is no United States"" by ""doing away with the concept of a nation state."" Sanders warned that open borders would allow wealthy corporations to ""bring in all kinds of people [who] work for $2 or $3 an hour"" and ""would make everybody in America poorer.""A recent WikiLeaks release revealed that in a private speech to foreign bankers, Hillary Clinton said, ""My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.""As the Los Angeles Times observed in 2007, the Clintons' praise for ""open borders"" frequently comes when they are speaking before foreign audiences and wealthy donors. The Los Angeles Times noted that, in particular, the Clintons have often sought to ""telegraph"" their support for open borders and a globalized world to ""wo[o] wealthy Indian American"" donors who have ""close ties to their native country and an interest in protecting outsourcing laws and expanding access to worker visas.""Emmons explained that in contrast to Clinton's allegiances to foreign nations and donors, Donald Trump will represent the interests of America and her citizens. ""This election is all about jobs, the economy, eradicating ISIS, the borders, and most importantly, loving America. ... Donald Trump will be on our team-the American team,"" Emmons said. ""When he becomes president, he's going to do what's best for Americans.""SIGN UP"	['Sanders', 'Hanna', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
8	8	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/15/republican-party-leaders-plot-purge-civil-war/	Republican Party Leaders Plot Purge, Civil War	"Just when you think Republican Party leaders can't possibly get more cynical, more hypocritical or more suicidal, they surprise you.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROver the past week, a few dozen prominent Republicans, led by 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain and joined by Utah's Senator Mike Lee and Colorado's Cory Gardner, dropped their support for Donald Trump and called on Republican voters to vote for other, ""down ticket"" candidates but not Trump.The New York Times on October 9 published a list of ""160 Republican Leaders who do not support Trump,"" and newspapers everywhere trumpeted the newest addition to the list.That chorus was joined briefly by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said he would vote for Trump but would not campaign for him or with him. Ryan also advised the entire Republican congressional delegation to do the same.This betrayal of the party's presidential nominee by top echelons of party leadership can only be called overt sabotage. Whether successful or not in denying Trump a victory on November 8, it undoubtedly is the opening shot in a civil war that will erupt full scale on November 9.The attempted take down of Trump was explained as an effort to ""salvage the dignity of the party"" in the aftermath of the public release of a recording of lewd remarks about some women made by Trump in 2005. When asked if the recording revealed anything about Donald Trump they did not know before, they had no answer. It is clear that the party leaders who have jumped ship are using the 2005 video recording as the excuse to do something they had been contemplating since Trump won the party nomination in July.No one citing the recording as an excuse for opposing Trump can say Trump's lewd remarks are more offensive than the known sexual conduct of former President Bill Clinton -- and many other White House occupants. Lewd and crude language is not exactly unknown in the halls of the West Wing, the Rayburn Building, RNC headquarters -- or Fox television sound stages.Are the American people turning against Donald Trump because of remarks he made in private eleven years ago? No. Might they turn against him if every Republican senator and congressman attacked him for those remarks? Yes, quite possibly. In that case, what would be the cause of the defeat, Trump's remarks or the party establishment's treason?The answer lies in looking at the facts, not Glenn Beck's self-indulgent rants. The latest Rasmussen poll shows that 69 percent of voters think Trump's attitude and remarks about women are either no worse or the same as Bill Clinton's, and only 23 percent think they are worse. That is a 3-to-1 margin saying it is not an important issue for the large majority of voters.So, if moral Puritanism is not a credible explanation for he organized insurrection against the party's presidential nominee, what is the explanation? Why this open declaration of war on the millions of voters who selected Trump as the party's candidate? The actions of Paul Ryan, McCain and the other party bigwigs only make sense if it is a signal of a planned purge of Trump supporters by the US Chamber of Commerce globalists.The hypocrisy of the Republican establishment's attempted take down of the Trump campaign is astonishing even by 2016 standards. After insisting that candidate Trump take the pledge to support the eventual nominee, many refused to accept the verdict of the presidential nomination process. It took months for Senator Cruz to endorse Trump, and Ohio's Gov. Kasich is still silent.The other element of hypocrisy is the fear of a Trump victory.After arguing for a full year that Trump couldn't possibly win and would lead the party to a catastrophic defeat, many of the same Republican leaders saw Trump steadily gaining ground on Hillary Clinton and decided a Trump victory would be even more catastrophic than a defeat. Immigration enforcement, an America First foreign policy, and sensible international trade treaties must not be allowed to prevail over globalist ambitions of the party establishment. Trump had to be stopped.That is why the sabotage did not occur earlier. Trump is only a mortal danger to the establishment if he has a chance of winning. As long as he was losing badly in the polls, the saboteurs could remain silent. But after mid-September when polls started showing Trump in a virtual tie with Clinton and gaining ground in all the ""battleground states,"" the knives were out. Why do you think the 2005 video was released when it was, when the liberal media certainly had it for months?It is beyond question that the Republican establishment fears a Trump victory more than a Trump defeat. They are more comfortable with Hillary Clinton in the White House than Trump. Only people who have been living on another planet for the last 18 months believe that Washington insiders are opposed to Trump because of his crude language or alleged chauvinistic attitudes toward women.So the Republican civil war is under way. Whether Trump wins or loses, the party establishment will use every weapon in its arsenal to purge the party not only of Trump's policy ideas but Trump's followers as well.On November 9, the order of the day will be -- business-as-usual. The party establishment and its allies in the Chamber of Commerce and the media will be working overtime to guarantee there will be no recognition or acknowledgement of the patriotic rebellion against the ""go along to get along"" mentality of Republican lawmakers that fueled first the Tea party revolt in 2009-2010 and then the Trump bandwagon.What the Republican establishment does not understand or will not accept is that Donald Trump is only the symptom, not the cause, of the grassroots rebellion against establishment thinking. Donald Trump gave voice to those concerns, those very justified concerns, about our nation's direction and our nation's very survival.Donald Trump the man and Trump the candidate has flaws and warts and weaknesses that were understandably exploited by opponents. But win or lose on November 8, the grassroots rebellion that fueled the Trump campaign will continue.That rebellion is now an open civil war within the Republican party, and that is a shame. But at least it is a war over real issues, real concerns, and real worries over the safety and survival of our nation. And that, my friends, will always be a war worth fighting.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'McCain', 'Cruz', 'Kasich', 'Paul']	[]

Two months ago, the Palestinians tried to sway Obama to begin the process immediately after the presidential elections in November, but their attempts have yet to yield any results.""At a moment when Israel's plan for new construction has seriously disappointed the government, which warned that Israel is doing everything to harm American interests in the region, we hope that the U.S. will lead this process,"" said the source.

This is a rare window of opportunity in which the entire international community can be recruited to a process that will aim at putting an end to the Israeli occupation.""According to the source, as part of the intensified contacts in the last few days, the Palestinians attempted to determine whether the U.S. might adopt the so-called French peace initiative or attempt to create a consensus in favor of a new process that would be a mix between the Arab and French efforts.""We are doing all we can, together with our friends in the government and with our partners in the EU, to convince the U.S. to begin this process,"" said the source.

The men were traveling to Mexico and allegedly had plans to travel on to Iraq or Syria.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERJason Michael Ludke, 35, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Yosvany Padilla-Conde, 30, an illegal alien who has been living in Wisconsin, were arrested on October 5 by Tom Green County Sheriff David Jones and a team of federal agents, according to Joe Hyde, president of San Angelo Live.Sheriff Jones told Hyde he had received a warning from the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) that the two suspected ISIS recruits could be heading through his county in route to Mexico. After surveilling the two men for a short time, deputies, Texas Department of Public Safety troopers, and FBI agents conducted a traffic stop and the two men were taken into custody.Sheriff Green stated Ludke was detained on an outstanding warrant from Wisconsin. His traveling companion, Padilla-Conde, having been identified asn an illegal alien, was held on immigration charges.Information provided by the Department of Justice's Eastern District of Wisconsin stated the two men were traveling to Mexico after having pledged their allegiance to ISIS. Their ultimate goal was to travel to Iraq or Syria and join up with the terrorist organization.Ludke's activities were discovered by the FBI when he contacted an undercover agent on Facebook. He sent the agent a friend request. The agent was assigned to monitor social media and search for ISIS recruiting activities. Shortly after the initial contact, the agent began instant messaging conversations with the suspect and learned of his plans. He told the agent he ""wants to make ""hijra"" (or migration) away from ""darul kufr"" (Land of the Infidel)"" Hyde reported.Ludke, going by the Muslim names Muhammad Nassir, Muhammad Abdun Naasir Al-Hannafi, and Abuz Sayyaf, told an undercover agent he had ""pledged his allegiance to the leader of ISIL (ISIS) (the purported ""Caliph""), Al-Baghdadi,"" according to the criminal complaint obtained by San Angelo Live. He reportedly pledged his love of Muslims and hatred towards infidels ""for Allah's sake.""He later sent the undercover FBI agent a video of himself pledging allegiance to the ISIS leader, Al-Baghdadi.Thinking the agent was an ISIS recruiter in the Middle East, Ludke told him he was making plans to come ""there."" He admitted to having a criminal history and said he would have to travel via Mexico where he would be able to purchase travel documents.According to court records obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Eastern District of Wisconsin, Ludke was convicted in 2010 on charges of threatening to kill a federal judge. He sent a series of threatening letters to the court of Federal District Court Judge William Griesbach in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The fourth letter, for which he pleaded guilty, states:Allow me to willfully leave to Istanbul, Turkey or 1will have no choice but to hunt you down and kill you and your staff!

At that time Padilla-Conde was going by the name AbuZaid Haddaf.The duo remained in contact with the undercover agent as they traveled from Wisconsin to Texas. They continued to discuss their plans to travel and join up with ISIS.Padilla-Conde had previously told the undercover agent he was having difficulties earning a living by working cash jobs and that they  were about to be evicted from their apartment. He told the agent he asked for, and received, permission to camp out in the parking lots of area mosques as they were traveling south, Hyde reported.He later admitted he was not really interested in joining ISIS and was using Ludke to make his way back to Mexico. He told officials he planned to dump Ludke once they crossed the border into Mexico.The duo was headed to El Paso when they were arrested in San Angelo. Padilla-Conde's brother-in-law had advised him that would be an easy place to cross back into Mexico.Sheriff Jones told San Angelo Live the arrest was all in a day's work. He expressed his gratitude to the FBI and the JTTF for their coordination with his agency. He said he was happy they were stopped before becoming a threat to the U.S. and American citizens.""Terrorism remains the FBI's top priority in keeping Americans safe,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge Justin Tolomeo said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. ""The arrest of these two individuals from Wisconsin, underscores how the real threat of terrorism can occur anywhere, at anytime.

But they didn't do that. And they didn't do that for a simple reason: Because it never happened, twelve years ago. Never complained, never talked to the bosses.So that's the way it is. I just want to tell you folks, it is a campaign that's amazing, and I'm not going to be talking about it much because we're talking about other things, and we have to talk about other things. But if affects five percent, or two percent, or ten percent, or--it's all false stuff. It's all a concerted effort. And I think it's the only way they're going to stop us. The only way. And I don't think that's going to happen.This election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy, but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system, and our system is rigged. This is reality, you know it, they know it, I know it, and pretty much the whole world knows it. The establishment and their media enablers will control over this nation through means that are very well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe, and morally deformed,"" Trump said in West Palm Beach, Florida. ""They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and your family, they will seek to destroy everything about you, including your reputation. They will lie, lie, lie, and then again they will do worse than that, they will do whatever is necessary. The Clintons are criminals, remember that. They're criminals.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Revenues are supposed to cover costs, and political interference on where post offices and other facilities are located is supposed to be removed from the process.The Postal Service has monopoly power over delivery of first-class mail and access to Americans' mailboxes, slots, etc. It uses these advantages and the tremendous delivery network and cost advantages of its unique ""monopoly-plus"" status - no property taxes, no vehicle taxes, income taxes payable only to itself, etc. - to compete with shipping and other businesses in what it calls its competitive lines.As a quasi-independent entity, the Postal Service provides its own benefits for employees and retirees. Since these benefits are promised and taxpayers are the backstop for it if the Postal Service cannot meet its obligations, it's only fair the Postal Service be required to prefund benefits.But the Postal Service has not paid a dime into the fund for six years and is now tens of billions of dollars behind. And now it wants Congress to give permission for it to skip out on this obligation altogether. It would do this by herding its retirees into Medicare, which is not expected to be solvent beyond 2029 already.A recent report from the Government Accountability Office found those covered only by Medicare averaged costing the system $8,100 per year on medical care. Those with Medicare and Medigap cost the system $15,600, and those with Medicare and employer wraparound coverage cost $14,400.And in a new paper from The Heritage Foundation, health care expert Walton Francis explained why this would be a problem.If retirees want to keep their doctors, insurance and choice through the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, they would have to enroll in Medicare Part B under the House legislation. This will mean an extra premium for people on fixed incomes for insurance they don't need and, if they live overseas, can't use at all. They would get some relief early on from the usual $1,460 per year payment, but premiums would ramp up and total more than $15,000 over 10 years.The legislation would increase healthcare payments for some retired workers, which is why the National Association of Retired Federal Employees opposes the legislation.If the 93,000 postal annuitants are forced into Part B, Francis said, this would increase Medicare spending by about $130 million now and $1.5 billion over a 10-year period - again, for something the Postal Service gets for free that its competitors have to pay for. And who would make up this difference? Taxpayers and other federal retirees who would see their costs go up.Postal employees account for a fifth of all federal employees and a fourth of current annuitants. Almost all retirees are enrolled in Medicare Part A hospital benefits, which, when doctors and drugs are counted, amounts to a $4,500 annual subsidy from Medicare to FEHBP plans.As of now, retirees would not have to pay the 10 percent-per-year penalty for waiting beyond age 65 to enroll. They would be ""deemed"" to have enrolled so they would not lose their FEHBP coverage, but the Social Security Administration, Department of Health and Human Services or Office of Personnel Management would have to locate them and somehow sign them up for Part B.This proposal would move postal workers into their own risk pool and out of the pool for all federal employees and annuitants. This is about a $700 million-per-year mistake, Francis wrote, because postal employees' average costs per family are $1,700 a year higher than those of non-postal families because they are older and get sick more.Francis suggests instead of moving postal retirees into Medicare, Congress should fix FEHBP. First, he says, quit subsidizing the purchase of the most expensive plans by ending cost-sharing of premiums and removing the pre-tax premium subsidy. Move toward a defined-contribution formula by, among other things, changing payment formulas, and address the way risk is absorbed.More importantly, he said, the onus should be on fixing FEHBP, not requiring postal retirees to purchase additional insurance they do not need.In other words, it's up to the Postal Service to get out of businesses it doesn't know how to run and to quit paying for its business mistakes by foisting retiree health costs on taxpayers and other annuitants.And no amount of reform legislation this year is going to change that.SIGN UP"	[]	['healthcare']

(Actually, the villain was also the blackguard.)Apparently it is acceptable to call someone a revolting slug if they're not a member of Parliament, although it's unclear from the Sydney Morning Herald's coverage if Rosie O'Donnell's variation, ""orange slug,"" would pass muster.None of it passed muster with Tony Abbott. He did say that Trump's 2011 videotaped comments were ""absolutely disgusting,"" and the tapes were ""gross beyond belief"" and ""completely indefensible,"" but the NSW motion was an ""exercise in moral vanity.""""Posturing of any sort is something which is not really fitting for a parliament,"" he added.""The point that I want to make is that the vast majority of Trump supporters are not deplorables, they really aren't. They are decent people who want to see change inside their country and that's fair enough,"" Abbott continued, referring to Hillary Clinton's dismissal of half of Donald Trump's supporters as a ""basket of deplorables.""He added that ""many of the Trump positions are reasonable enough,"" which sounds a bit like when Barack Obama told Hillary Clinton she was ""likable enough,"" and those two seem to be getting along well enough these days, so Abbott's comments ought to be good enough to keep him on Trump's sunny side.Abbott also declared himself an ""admirer"" of America, and stressed the international community's need for a ""great and strong"" United States, because it is ""the one country in the world with the strength and goodwill to be a relatively acceptable arbiter of all the problems the world faces.""The Sydney Morning Herald said Abbott's defense of Trump ""will be interpreted by his colleagues as another attempt to reach out to far-right voters who abandoned the Liberal party at the last election following the installation of the moderate Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister, and a further sign he is jockeying to be returned to the leadership.""Strangely, the SMH didn't say anything about the NSW lawmakers using their condemnation of Trump as a stunt to reach out to left-wing voters, even though the author of the motion, Jeremy Buckingham, is noted for such previous stunts as setting a river on fire to highlight environmental issues.

Clinton 2016	"SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt was always going to be this way: Bush vs. Clinton 2016.From the very start, the media tried to rig this election to be a showdown between the Republican Party's polite and uptight Bush clan and the Democratic Party's shameless and self-serving Clinton mafia.Only the Bush they had in mind -- Jeb! -- did not have the stamina to keep up with the exclamation point his campaign deployed to put a little pep in his step. The poor little punctuation mark hung like a sad, shriveled carrot, dangling there beyond the end of his name in hopes of spurring him toward dynastic destiny.Some eight wild months after Jeb! finally surrendered and began a long nap, in swoops Billy Bush to rescue the dynasty by slaying the family's greatest threat: a Republican NOT named Bush.The Bush family motto has always been if not a Bush, then how about a Clinton? We've all heard how, on long, overnight plane trips together, Bubba gives Poppy the bed.Oh, dear.But, back to the tape. Listening to Mr. Bush enthusiastically encourage Mr. Trump's vulgar and absurd approach to picking up women, it is clear that Mr. Bush needs no help from an exclamation point. He is so excited in the recording that he is practically panting as he trots alongside Mr. Trump as the billionaire lover dazzles with all his fantastical boasting.But let's be honest, in the locker room, there are talkers and there are doers. These are the words of a talker.After playing the tape over and over and over, the media then sits up and screams, ""Put the kids to bed!"" Finally, they can caution parents to keep their children away from Donald Trump.But have they forgotten what our children have already been exposed to in the great modern American political debate?In September 1998, The Washington Post reported:""A few hours before President Clinton began his videotaped grand jury testimony Aug. 17, the FBI laboratory informed Starr's office that the president was the source of the DNA taken from Monica S. Lewinsky's navy blue dress 'to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.'""""Daddy, what is a DNA sample?"" the child asks. ""And how did it get onto her blue dress? What is an intern?""Or about this gem from 1997:""Mommy, what does 'distinguishing characteristic' mean? And how do you get Peyronie's disease? What's an affidavit?""Seriously, people, you have dragged America's children through far worse.The question I still have is how is it possible that Mr. Bush and Mr. Trump could have been recorded saying such things and, for 11 years, NBC News took no action whatsoever against its reporter? Does NBC News, owner of the Access Hollywood program, condone such behavior and comments from their ""on air talent""?And when they finally decided to take action, did company officials actually discuss ways of releasing the tape of Mr. Trump's comments while covering up for Mr. Bush?And how long exactly did the company sit on the tape before dropping the bombshell ""October surprise"" just weeks before the election?We won't hold our breath waiting for answers to these questions.But it all reminds us that it is beyond high time that we grab the Republican Party by the Bush and grab theDemocratic Party by the Clinton and toss them all out into the gutter where they belong.* Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Hurt']	[]

It's easy to see why this should be so. It cannot possibly be to any living thing's advantage to be confused about male and female.

Men and women differ down to their very hair, as anyone can perceive who looks at a woman's smooth chin or a man's bald pate.Ordinary and healthy people love that it is so, and on those exceedingly rare occasions when you cannot determine someone's sex from a glance or from one moment on the telephone--and some people will go through their entire lives without a single such experience--we feel that it is strange and disconcerting, just as we would feel if we were in the presence of someone who was born without arms. We are not talking about a mere statistical norm here, but about what is paradigmatically human.To pretend, therefore, that we do not know what we immediately and urgently perceive is to do violence at once to human nature, language, the possibility of a shared life, and the intellect's capacity to apprehend reality.

Burwell,"" the big case about whether or not Obamacare is constitutional, which progressives were concerned about.The Hillary Clinton campaign took its cue from Tanden, the president of the left-wing Center for American Progress. Here's part of an email that Tanden sent to top Clinton campaign officials and former State Department officials:oops!I mentioned this to John some time back, but think it's a bit more current now.  It is most likely that this decision has already been made by the Court, but on the off chance that history is repeating itself, then it's possible they are still deciding (last time, seems like Roberts went from striking the mandate to supporting it in the weeks before). As Jennifer will remember, it was pretty critical that the President threw the gauntlet down last time on the Court, warning them in the first case that it would politicize the role of the Court for them to rule against the ACA. As a close reader of the case, I honestly believe that was vital to scaring Roberts off. In this case, I'm not arguing that Hillary spend a lot of time attacking the Court. I do think it would be very helpful to all of our interest in a decision affirming the law, for Roberts and perhaps Kennedy to see negative political consequences to ruling against the government. Therefore, I think it would be helpful to have a story of how progressives and Hillary would make the Supreme Court an election issue (which would be a ready argument for liberals) if the Court rules against the government. It's not that you wish that happens. But that would be the necessary consequence of a negative decision...the Court itself would become a hugely important political issue. At CAP Action, we can get that story started. But kinda rests on you guys to make it stick. What do you think? If you want to proceed, we should move soon. Let me know thoughts. And I'm happy to discuss.Neera""I'm into it but defer to Jen on this one,"" said Jake Sullivan, the apparent subordinate of Jen Palmieri.""And to clarify, the candidate wouldn't have to do anything. I think we could move the story with just a nod from the campaign on the strategy,"" Tanden said.""Adding Brian Fallon and Christina,"" Palmieri said. ""She has already been making this an issue. Not sure how in depth you are suggesting but seems like this should be manageable.""""I will talk to our team. But my thought is you guys could even just affirm on background or something.

I mentioned this to John some time back, but think it's a bit more current now.  It is most likely that this decision has already been made by the Court, but on the off chance that history is repeating itself, then it's possible they are still deciding (last time, seems like Roberts went from striking the mandate to supporting it in the weeks before). As Jennifer will remember, it was pretty critical that the President threw the gauntlet down last time on the Court, warning them in the first case that it would politicize the role of the Court for them to rule against the ACA. As a close reader of the case, I honestly believe that was vital to scaring Roberts off. In this case, I'm not arguing that Hillary spend a lot of time attacking the Court. I do think it would be very helpful to all of our interest in a decision affirming the law, for Roberts and perhaps Kennedy to see negative political consequences to ruling against the government. Therefore, I think it would be helpful to have a story of how progressives and Hillary would make the Supreme Court an election issue (which would be a ready argument for liberals) if the Court rules against the government. It's not that you wish that happens. But that would be the necessary consequence of a negative decision...the Court itself would become a hugely important political issue. At CAP Action, we can get that story started. But kinda rests on you guys to make it stick. What do you think? If you want to proceed, we should move soon. Let me know thoughts. And I'm happy to discuss.

Staffers had been considering arranging photo ops depicting Hillary doing everyday jobs.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAn email addressed to Clinton's campaign chief John Podesta and high-ranking staffers Jennifer Palmieri and Charlie Baker, titled ""a humble suggestion,"" was sent to help Team Hillary ""combat the meme"" that she is ""out of touch"" with the American people.The message was sent by liberal talk show host and former Michigan Democratic Governor Jennifer M. Granholm and suggested that Clinton's campaign should start ""taking a page from former Florida Senator Bob Graham, and doing, say, 8 'work days' over the next 15 months.""The Canadian-born Granholm went on to explain how the campaign would go about this scheme to convince Americans that Hillary isn't really a privileged, rich, white woman.She could acknowledge flat-out that she's been in a security/privilege bubble, and is determined to break out of it. Then she selects 8 occupations that she is willing to spend one day working at. She humbles herself, but gives dignity to the workers whose salaries she wants to raise. Perhaps she makes beds in a hotel for a day. Perhaps she busses tables at Denny's or works behind the counter at McDonald's or Chipotle's! Perhaps she works in a nursing home. Or is a janitor in a school cafeteria. Or works at a daycare center. You get the idea -- have her pick some low wage service jobs that she's actually willing to spend 6-8 hours doing (any shorter and she'd be criticized for not putting in a full day).The two-term Democratic Governor and firebrand talk show host insisted that Hillary's fans would ""go wild for it,"" and the fantasy storyline would be an ""acknowledgement that she is determined to 'see' real people, despite her own good fortunes.""Granholm also hoped the massive, artificial photo op project would help Hillary see Americans in a new light, too, saying, ""She would be humbled and inspired by the experience.""Apparently, the Clinton campaign did consider Granholm's scheme to ""humble"" and humanize Hillary as the suggestion seems to have been forwarded to a group of Clinton insiders. But ultimately, It appears that Granholm's artifice was rejected, likely as ludicrous.In the end, it appears that Team Clinton decided that the scheme was just too far-fetched.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.She could acknowledge flat-out that she's been in a security/privilege bubble, and is determined to break out of it.

Do you feel that same leadership and integrity is missing in today's leadership?""Kissinger, standing in front of a mural of the Great Wall of China, answered that in choosing to resign rather than face impeachment over his involvement in the Watergate scandal, Nixon ""set an example that others can follow.""Kissinger, who served as Secretary of State for both Presidents Nixon and Gerald Ford, was the architect of Nixon's China policy and his historic trip to the mainland in 1972.All diplomatic relations, communications and trade between the United States and ""Red"" China had been cut off during the Korean War (1950-1953). Kissinger told the press that Nixon had ""the vision to open to China and to put before the American people a new vision."" He was accompanied by Chinese diplomat Cui Tiankai, who currently serves as the Chinese Ambassador to the United States.Asked for his thoughts on the Library's renovation, Kissinger said: ""I think it's spectacular, educational and honest.""Nixon's daughter Trisha lauded him for ending the military draft, ending segregation and restoring land to Native Americans, among other monumental achievements. She also reminded those present that it was her father who helped save Israel during the Yom Kippur War.She quoted her late father: ""We must seize the moment not just for ourselves but for others. Only if this becomes a better world for others will it be a better world for us, and only when we participate in a cause greater than ourselves can we be true to ourselves.""Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), the U.S. Archivist David Ferriero, and former California Governor Pete Wilson were among those present. Wilson gave a stirring talk about Nixon, recalling all he had done for America and for the world. He described Nixon as ""a conservative reformer"" and a man ""with incredible energy and an indomitable spirit.""A few years ago, Wilson recalled, he took his first trip to Israel,  where an Israeli asked him who he thought the most popular American president is in Israel. ""Well, I'll tell you who: Richard Nixon,"" the Israeli man told him.""He believed that All Americans deserved an equal opportunity. He didn't believe that we should give precedence based on the accident of birth,"" Wilson said. He added, Nixon ""quietly, without fanfare, went about enforcing the desegregation of schools in this nation, and notably in the South.""Nixon was a go-getter, Wilson recalled. ""You have heard that he has said, 'I am not a quitter,'"" he said. ""When under stress, lesser men would have simply capitulated. Not he.""Breitbart News also spoke with Nixon's grandson, Chris Cox, who elaborated on the 37th president's integrity and character. Cox used the 1960 election to demonstrate Nixon's character.""There was certainly a lot of controversy in Illinois and Texas about the veracity of the vote,"" he said. ""My grandfather actually decided not to contest the vote because he thought it wasn't right for the country. He didn't want to put the country through it.""Cox continued: ""Additionally, you mentioned his decision to resign. Again, he didn't want to put the country through a process that would rip the country apart [and leave them] with a president who would be a lame duck, especially with all the issues surrounding the Cold War and the Soviet Union in the mid-1970s.""Fast-forwarding to the current election and today's leadership, Cox told Breitbart News, ""when we look at the rhetoric today, I think that candidates should -- when the election is over -- take a leaf from his book to always be gracious in defeat. Because, one of the candidates will lose. To be gracious in defeat and accept the will of the people. And I have a lot of confidence that both of the candidates will ultimately come to the conclusion that the people have spoken and our democracy will continue. And that's more important than any one man, even the president.""Cox noted that he is supporting Donald Trump for president. Earlier a member of the press corps asked Cox who he thought Nixon would vote for if he were still alive today. Cox said his grandfather voted Republican down the line, suggesting Nixon would also support Trump because he is his party's nominee.Ultimately, Cox said that he knows both presidential candidates well and noted that whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins, ""either of them will bring characteristics to the White House that could make them great presidents so long as they don't give in to the lesser angels of their nature.""Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz

And while you are at it, no use reading Wikileaks either, as the WaPo suggests the leaked emails showing plans for executive action are old news too.The WaPo began by trying to diminish O'Keefe's hidden camera video, saying,The [hidden camera video], dramatically titled ""Russ Feingold: Hillary Might Issue Executive Order on Guns,"" shows O'Keefe suiting up and driving to a Palo Alto, Calif., fundraiser for Feingold. (The Democrat's short stint at Stanford University, and fundraising and California, have been attacked by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson's campaign.) Once there, an unidentified Project Veritas reporter prompts Feingold to talk about guns.They then suggest Clinton and Feingold's support of using executive action for gun control has not been a ""secret."" They point to Feingold's support of President Obama's January 5 executive gun controls and they quoted a Breitbart News story from May, the focus of which was Clinton's plans for executive controls. They took the same approach with the emails released via Wikileaks. They stressed that Clinton's support of using executive action to circumvent Congress on guns was not a secret or else Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon would have refrained from corresponding about it with pollster John Anzalone.The WaPo concludes, ""As with many WikiLeaks-inspired stories on the right, the undercover Feingold tape reveals something any attentive voter or reporter knew already, but it does it with an air of intrigue.""It is interesting to note that the WaPo story conveniently omits the fact that Feingold was not the only person talking about Clinton's gun control plans in the O'Keefe video. Another individual, Amy Rao, also spoke on the hidden camera video. Rao is a friend of Clinton's and hosted the Feingold fundraiser where the video footage was filmed.It's a safe to assume Rao's words are the ones the WaPo does not want readers to read. Rao said, ""Hillary wants to shut it down. She wants to shut it down,"" referring to guns.

It came in an annual report by the Treasury Department and the White House budget office.In the presidential campaign, intractable budget deficits and growing debt have been mostly neglected by Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.The latest figures show that the government is borrowing 15 cents of every dollar it spends. Government spending went up almost 5 percent to $3.9 trillion in fiscal 2016, but revenues stayed flat at $3.3 trillion.Obama came to power after the 2008 financial crisis and as the economy was still emerging from a deep recession, and the deficit spiked to $1.4 trillion, which required Treasury to borrow 40 cents for every dollar spent by the government. It remained above $1 trillion for three more years before declining to $439 billion last year as the U.S. economy continues to slowly grow.""The Obama Administration's agenda has spurred durable economic growth and the longest streak of job growth on record, while sharply reducing the deficit to a sustainable level,"" said Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a statement. ""We have built a solid foundation for continued investment in economic growth and opportunity for all, while maintaining fiscal discipline and using fiscal space appropriately to grow the economy.""Now, the Congressional Budget Office is predicting deficits will, more or less, remain in the $600 billion range for the next several years. Those are eye-popping numbers to the average person, but they represent about 3 percent of the size of the economy, a level many economists say is bearable.Trump is promising tax cuts estimated to cost $6 trillion or so in the coming decade and has criticized congressional Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, for proposing to cut Medicare and other government programs. Clinton promises to increase taxes on the wealthy and spend the money on college tuition subsidies, infrastructure and expansion of President Barack Obama's health care law.""There's no leadership on the campaign trail. What both Clinton and Trump have said, essentially, is, 'Here are the new things that I want to do,'"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a GOP economist and president of the American Action Forum think tank. ""What that's really saying is: 'I have no play to fix the existing problem. None.' So they have no plan.""If Clinton wins, many Washington observers believe the chronically gridlocked capital city will remain unable to act on major issues such as the deficit, taxes or weaknesses in Obama's 2010 health care law.""We just have big philosophical differences,"" Ryan told a home-state group of college Republicans on Friday, adding that a Clinton victory would mean ""having more of the same stalemate.""The deficit issue has largely fallen in prominence in Washington in recent years, due in large part to its fall from record highs and a sense of resignation that Obama and congressional Republicans simply can't agree on ways to cut it after some failed attempts in recent years. Most economists don't believe the deficit is very worrisome in the short term.""It's totally manageable. There's literally nothing there to worry about,"" said left-leaning economist Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""What's the interest rate on 10-year bonds or the 30-year bond? If actors in the financial markets thought there was any plausible probability of this sort of fiscal crisis ... we'd be looking at 10-year rates of maybe 5, 6, 7 (percent).""But the picture over the long run is more problematic, at least under a conventional view that if deficits continue to rise the national debt grows, government borrowing would ""crowd out"" private lending and force up interest rates. And if interest rates go up, the government would have to pay much more to finance the more than $14 trillion in Treasury debt held by investors.""We're going into a debt spiral and, depending how far down you get in that spiral you have a sovereign debt crisis,"" said Holtz-Eakin, a former GOP-appointed CBO director.

Mike Pence's visit to the state on Thursday, a senior campaign official told Breitbart News that the trend is part of the ""movement"" seen at Trump-Pence rallies across the country, of Americans that see the ""world spinning out of control"" under President Obama's foreign policy.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Pennsylvania GOP has registered over 240,000 new voters in the past eleven months according to the state party. In even less time, over the course of 2016 nearly 100,000 Democrats switched their party preference to Republican.When asked about this shift in registration and the flood of new Republican voters, the senior official told Breitbart News, ""I think it's indicative of what we're seeing with [Republican presidential nominee] Donald Trump and Mike Pence, the response at their rallies. You had DT getting 21,000 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Pence's rallies are growing in attendance, the Pensacola rally today in Florida has close to 1,000 registered. We're seeing Democrats, Republicans and Independents coming together and you've heard Gov. Pence say it before, this movement is not about a party, it's about the future of our country and I think that's what you're starting to see and I think these numbers are indicative of that.""Pence made two campaign stops at GOP events in Pennsylvania on Thursday evening as news was breaking of the surge in Republican registrations. Those stops were in Orefield for a Lehigh County GOP event followed by a dinner at the historic Bethlehem Hotel for the Northampton County GOP Dinner. Both were packed events.""People are being drawn to Donald Trump,"" said the official. ""They're interested in fixing the rigged system that's holding our economy back, rebuilding our military, our nation. You can see the world spinning out of control. In Yemen people are firing on warships. These events are the direct result of President Obama's foreign policy and that's why I think you are seeing so many come out to the rallies and register to vote.""""What we started to see with Donald Trump's campaign in the primary election, now we're seeing it take shape through the general election,"" the official said.Hotel Bethlehem managing partner Bruce Haines said of Pence:Gov. Pence's visit assures that our future VP will be included in our Gallery of former distinguished guests in our Tap Room since Sen. Kaine was also here in September. That gallery includes 4 former U.S. Presidents, Winston Churchill, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford & his holiness The Dalai Lama.Gov Pence understands the dilemma that small businesses like ours have faced since Obamacare was implemented. I had the opportunity to discuss that issue during our short visit together before his speech here tonight. He understands the unintended consequences of reduced work hours for employees.We were honored to have hosted Gov. Pence tonight & hope he returns in the future as perhaps our 5th President some day.At the Lehigh County GOP event, Congressman Mike Kelly introduced Pence, telling the crowd that if anyone ever had any doubt as to Trump's judgement, to look at his choice of Gov. Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana Gov.

While acknowledging ""this election has taken some dark--sometimes very dark--turns,"" Ryan ignored for the most part Republican nominee Donald Trump and the controversies surrounding him. Instead Ryan focused on the failures of liberal progressivism.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""The last eight years has been one long liberal progressive experiment,"" Ryan said Friday. ""Time and again, we have been told if we just spend more money, create more programs to live under and more rules to live by, put one more wing on the great palace of government, this will solve all of our problems.""""Yet after all that, we feel less safe and less secure. Less free and less prosperous. As government grows more unaccountable and unresponsive, there is less faith and less trust. And that is because liberal progressivism simply does not work,"" he continued. ""It is the longest con."" 
The Wisconsin Republican went on to ask, directing his sights on this election, ""What vision do Hillary Clinton and her party offer the people?"" ""The America they want does not stand out. It is ordinary. There is a gloom and a grayness to things,"" he continued, saying:In the America they want, the driving force is the state. It is a place where government is taken away from the people, and we are ruled by our betters...by a cold and unfeeling bureaucracy that replaces original thinking.It is a place where the government twists the law--and the Constitution itself--to suit its purposes. A place where liberty is always under assault, where passion--the very stuff of life--is extinguished.
As for what Republicans alternatively offer for the future of America, Ryan says, ""We want an America that values disruption and innovation. Because in a time when you can customize your life, right down to the channels you want, one-size-fits-all designs [referring to Democratic policies] are creaky and worn out.""This is what liberal progressivism does. Even in an age of diversity, it demands conformity and sameness. ...It traps people. It traps people in health care 'exchanges' you can't navigate, rules you can't understand or afford, and a tax code you can't make heads or tails out of unless you hire an army of lawyers.It is not about freeing you--it is about limiting you. There is no room to run, no chance to grow, or to fail for that matter. People are not needed, they are counted and sorted.This is how you can so casually classify whole groups of people as a 'basket of deplorables,' as Hillary Clinton did.
