In a two-way race, ABC News/WaPo reports Clinton 50 percent, Trump 46 percent. With all four candidates in the mix, it's Clinton 47 percent, Trump 43 percent, Libertarian Gary Johnson 5 percent, and the Green Party's Jill Stein two percent.The survey was conducted between October 10 and October 13, with a modest sample size for a national survey, 740 likely voters. 90 percent of respondents said they were following the presidential race very or somewhat closely, and 85 percent said they were absolutely certain to vote.Clinton and Trump had roughly comparable percentages of voters who said they were ""locked in"" and would not change their minds before the election, and comparable levels of enthusiasm from their voters. As in most other surveys, both candidates are ""underwater"" in their favorable/unfavorable ratings, but Trump's were worse - 43 percent to 53 percent for Clinton, 31 percent to 66 percent for Trump. They have nearly identical ratings for honesty, with 34 percent describing each of them as honest and trustworthy.ABC/WaPo's respondents thought Clinton won the second presidential debate by a margin of 45 percent to 32 percent.Interestingly, the two major-party candidates are within a point or two of each other on most of the major issues - the economy, immigration, and terrorism. Clinton is more trusted to handle an international crisis (55 percent to 39 percent) and more trusted to handle ethics in government (45 percent to 37 percent). The latter result must be a great relief to the Clinton campaign, given her history, and the news currently emerging from WikiLeaks.Clinton leads Trump by 69 percent to 22 percent on ""women's rights,"" and 55 percent said Trump's treatment of women was a legit issue in the campaign, which would seem to suggest the big negative news for him has been making an impact... but then only 35 percent of respondents said the videotape of Trump's lewd remarks from 11 years ago made them less likely to vote for him.A similar percentage (34 percent) said that Hillary Clinton's mistreatment of women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment and sexual assault was a relevant issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.SIGN UP"

Here's to another #100YearsStrong.-- President Obama (@POTUS) October 16, 2016Planned Parenthood was founded on October 16, 1916 by eugenicist Margaret Sanger who worked to control the populations of blacks and others she believed to be ""unfit.""Planned Parenthood's annual reports show a consistent decline in legitimate health care services, such as pap smears and sexually-transmitted disease treatment, reports Live Action News. The ""nonprofit"" abortion chain's most recent IRS form 990 for 2014 shows that its president Cecile Richards' salary and compensation jumped to $957,952, double the salary she made just three years ago. In 2011, Richards' reported income was $420,153.Its most recent tax return also shows that Planned Parenthood's 12 highest paid employees all earn six-figure salaries amounting to almost half a billion dollars.Planned Parenthood takes in more than $500 million in taxpayer funding annually - as well as some $186 million in private and corporate donations - and now performs over 300,000 abortions per year in the United States.In 2013, Barack Obama became the first president to ever address Planned Parenthood, promising to stand with the abortion business against efforts to ""turn back the clock to policies more suited to the 1950s than the 21st century.""""Thank you. God bless you,"" the president said to Planned Parenthood and its supporters at a gala event celebrating the organization's 100th anniversary.Consistent with its narrative that women need government protection in order to survive, Planned Parenthood has continually sought protection from the Obama administration against states that have asserted their rights to redirect Medicaid funding away from Planned Parenthood and toward other federally qualified healthcare centers that provide more comprehensive services, but do not perform abortions.The Obama administration has threatened states that have chosen to eliminate Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding, warning that such action could be a violation of federal law, punishable by cutting off of other federal aid.Planned Parenthood has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, who has vowed to work to repeal the longstanding Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding of abortions. Clinton has said that unborn babies have no constitutional rights.For a century, Planned Parenthood has made it possible for women to determine their own lives.

According to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 60 percent of Americans in the marketplaces will be able to choose from three or more insurers with multiple plans to choose from, the Post reports.North Carolina is not the only state where 95 of its 100 counties will only have one insurer to choose from.States such as Oklahoma, Alaska, Alabama, South Carolina and Wyoming only have one insurer to choose from on its exchanges for 2017 statewide.Nearly three-fourths of Florida's counties and more than four-fifths of Mississippi's will also be down to one insurer.Administration officials say that the lack of insurers returns to a pattern that predates Obamacare, where many in rural areas had a lack of coverage options.But in many states, North Carolina being one of them, marketplace shoppers in urban areas will only have one insurer to choose from.Breitbart previously reported that more than a million people are projected to lose their health insurance in 2017 because of insurers departing the exchanges.SIGN UP

The president [Bill Clinton] will no longer be on the board of the foundation. He will no longer raise money for the foundation; we'll no longer have our international programs or our international donors,"" Shalala said in an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis.""Those organizations that we've created will spin off into private charities themselves... and be able to continue their work and continue to raise money, but directly themselves,"" she added.Shalala said the foundation will merge with other organizations in some instances and redirect resources to those other groups.The foundation will also stop directly working internationally and will no longer accept donations from corporate foundations or foreign donors.The Clinton Foundation has long been accused of pay-for-play schemes, which have been detailed in the book Clinton Cash by Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer.Leaked emails from Wikileaks show that right before the book was released, Clinton's campaign staff panicked and told her she had to answer questions from the press instead of hiding behind a video like she had planned to do to address the claims, Breitbart News reported.Since the book was released, there have been numerous calls for the foundation to shut down, including a headline from The Huffington Post that called for the foundation's closure.SIGN UP"

In fact, he's tied with Hillary Clinton in Utah.Donald Trump leads with 37 percent, while Hillary Clinton and Evan McMullin draw 20 percent each, followed by Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson with 7 percent and Jill Stein of the Green Party with 1 percent.The CBS/YouGov poll was taken between 10/12 and 10/14, with a 5.7 percent margin of error. By way of comparison, a slightly older Monmouth poll covering October 10 through 12, with a sample size less than half what CBS News and YouGov used, reported Trump 34 percent, Clinton 28 percent, McMullin 20 percent, Johnson 7 percent, Stein 1 percent. Either these two polls are in significant disagreement about Trump's strength in Utah, or Republican voters in the state are beginning to swing back to Trump.According to CBS News/YouGov, Utah voters are highly engaged in the presidential race, with 65 percent saying they have paid a great deal of attention to the campaign, and fully 91 percent saying they will definitely vote.The ""negative vote"" factor is strong in the state. 56 percent of Trump's voters said they supported him ""mainly to oppose Hillary Clinton,"" while 48 percent of her voters said the same with respect to Trump.A slightly higher percentage of respondents said they would never consider voting for Clinton than Trump (85 percent to 75 percent.) Clinton also fares slightly worse on the question of voters disliking her ""as a person,"" although Clinton and Trump both generate strong personal dislike (74 percent Clinton, 69 percent Trump.)Sixty-five percent of respondents said Clinton was running for President primarily to ""help herself and her friends,"" while only 12 percent thought she wanted to help the country, and 17 percent said it was a mix of both. For Trump, 41 percent said he was running to help himself and his friends, 30 percent said he wanted to help the country, and 22 percent said it was a mix of both.Another poll question reveals Trump gained more ground with Utah voters than Clinton after the second presidential debate. 24 percent said they felt more positive about Trump versus 38 percent more negative, while for Clinton only 10 percent said they felt more positive, and 47 percent had a negative reaction. Respondents were evenly divided on whether the third presidential debate could alter their voting decision.Clinton partisans will be galled to discover Utah voters told CBS News and YouGov that Trump was slightly more prepared to be Commander-in-Chief than she is (35 percent Trump, 31 percent Clinton.) The strongest responses for descriptions of Trump were for ""Would bring change to Washington"" and ""Is a risky choice""... but choosing Clinton was seen as almost as risky.As for the big negative stories hitting both campaigns, 75 percent said Clinton's email scandal and the WikiLeaks revelations reveal that ""her motives in private are different than what she says in public."" For Trump, only 14 percent said the 11-year-old videotape of him using offensive language made it impossible for them to support him, while 52 percent agreed the tape was offensive but it didn't change their vote, and 30 percent thought ""people are making too much out of it.""Considering how much support Trump seemed to consolidate in this poll, respondents were surprisingly ambivalent about whether the Republican Party should rally behind him and help him win the election (43 percent), do nothing and let Trump run on his own (20 percent), or try to convince him to drop out of the race (34 percent).SIGN UP"

""As they say, the apple doesn't fall far,"" Band added.Who is Doug Band?SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe email was triggered by a friendly note from Chelsea Clinton sent to Doug Band and senior Clinton advisor Justin Cooper.Hi Doug and Justin - Just met Clark Winter on our BA flight and he had terrific things to say about Dad and you Doug and CGI generally and it was nice to hear as ever so I wanted to pass along. Sorry for brevity. We're taking off. Hope alls well in Davos Justin.ChelseaClark Winter is likely a reference to investment management consultant Clark Winter, whose biography list him as ""an internationally known investor and commentator on geopolitics and global financial markets.""Doug Band's comment on Chelsea Clinton's email to Podesta and Mills was blunt:She sends me one of these types of emails every few days/weekAs they say, the apple doesn't fall farA kiss on the cheek while she is sticking a knife in the back, and frontMany could argue there are few people in the world who would have a better personal insight into Bill and Hillary Clinton than Doug Band.Longtime Clinton advisor Doug Band is at the center of their world and his comment seems to indicate that he considers either Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton or both to be disingenuous backstabbers as well. The assessment is shocking coming from someone so close to the Clintons.As his official biography says on the website for his company Teneo Holdings:Douglas J. Band is a co-founder and President of Teneo.Mr. Band began working in the White House in 1995, serving in the White House Counsel's office for four years and later in the Oval Office as the President's Aide. In 1999, he was appointed by President Clinton as a Special Assistant to the President before he was made one of the youngest Deputy Assistants ever to serve a President.Mr. Band served as President Clinton's chief advisor from 2002 until 2012, advising him as the Counselor to the President, and was the key architect of Clinton's post-Presidency. He created and built the Clinton Global Initiative, which to date, has raised $69 billion for 2,100 philanthropic initiatives around the world and impacted over 400 million people in 180 countries. On March 1, 2012, President Clinton said of Doug: ""I couldn't have achieved half of what I have in my post-presidency without Doug Band. Doug is my Counselor and a board member of the Clinton Global Initiative, which was created at his suggestion.""While that is Doug Band's description from his own company, a 2013 article in the New Republic entitled Scandal at Clinton Inc. gives more insight into the relationship between Doug Band and the Clintons.He is rarely written about, almost never quoted, and many Clinton associates are loath to discuss him on the record. ""Doug is taboo--no one touches the guy,"" says one person who has had extensive dealings with him. On the handful of occasions he has spoken openly to the media, he has struck an impeccably humble tone. ""The thing I most enjoy in my job is helping people,"" he once told his college alumni magazine. ""I have been able to remain behind the scenes, making a difference and changing people's lives."" But as Band attempts to build a business of his own, the methods he once employed discreetly in the service of his boss have started to attract unwelcome attention.Band himself did not respond to an extensive list of questions for this article, but over the course of nine months, I spoke with more than three dozen people who have worked with him over the arc of his career. Inside the realm known as Clintonland, he is the subject of considerable angst. There are those who worry about the overlap between his work for the Clinton Global Initiative-- which he conceived and helped run for six years--and his energetic efforts to expand Teneo's client base. And there are those who worry about how some of the messier aspects of the charity's operations could create trouble for Hillary Clinton, who has made the family foundation her base as she contemplates a presidential run. But the real cause for these anxieties runs deeper. At its heart, the unease with Band reflects an unease with the phenomenon of post-presidential Clintonism itself.Band's company Teneo Holding also has come under scrutiny for hiring Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin under an employment arrangement that can best be described as unique.As Politico reported:A spring 2012 email to Hillary Clinton's top State Department aide, Huma Abedin, asked for help winning a presidential appointment for a supporter of the Clinton Foundation, according to a chain obtained by POLITICO.The messages illustrate the relationship between Clinton's most trusted confidante and the private consulting company that asked for the favor, Teneo -- a global firm that later hired Abedin. Abedin signed on with the company while she still held a State Department position, a dual employment that is now being examined by congressional investigators.Abedin's status as a ""special government employee"" has been questioned by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who has raised concerns about any overlapping duties and whether they posed potential conflicts of interest. Abedin also worked as an adviser to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit founded by former President Bill Clinton.Following on the revelations in Peter Schweitzer's book and film Clinton Cash  about the tight connection between the Clinton Global initiative and Hillary Clinton's career as Secretary of State, the WikiLeaks drops have provided new information on just how tight those connections really are.As Breitbart News reported, other revelations from Hillary Clinton's emails show that:Doug Band was emailing Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills to set up meetings for big donors, such as Gilbert Chagoury - a close friend of Bill Clinton's who has poured up to $6 million into slush funds like the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. The New York Post notes he was fined $66 million by Switzerland in a 2000 money-laundering case.Another email forwarded to Abedin and Mills by Band explicitly asked for a ""favor,"" and Band told the Clinton team it was ""important to take care"" of the redacted individual, because ""we all have had him on our radar."" Judicial Watch says Band was trying to help Mr. or Ms. Redacted get a job.A request by Breitbart News to Mr. Band for comment at the email address listed returned as bounced.Hi Doug and Justin - Just met Clark Winter on our BA flight and he had terrific things to say about Dad and you Doug and CGI generally and it was nice to hear as ever so I wanted to pass along.

Six hours later the jury did just that.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe sentence follows other recently publicized sentences where people have been convicted for multiple drunk-driving offenses. One Texas man received six life-sentences following his sixth DWI arrest. This incident resulted in a crash when he was pulling into a liquor store. Two people were killed in the crash and a third person received life-altering injuries, the Houston Chronicle reported in late September. Another man in Montgomery County received a life sentence in June for his ninth DWI conviction, Montgomery County Police Reporter's Scott Engle wrote.The Hays County jury handed down the 99-year sentence to San Marcos, Texas, resident Jose Marin following his 8th conviction for driving under the influence. Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Stalbaum said the sentence was the only way to prevent Marin from ever driving drunk again, the San Antonio Express-News reported on Friday.Court records reveal that Marin was convicted in 1983 for his first DWI offense. He piled on a second offence the following year and in 1986 he earned his first jail sentence on his third conviction. That offense landed him in jail for 33 months.Following a seven-year stretch of no arrests, Marin was again arrested and convicted for DWI in 1990. That conviction earned him a 5-year prison sentence, but in 1991 he was busted yet again. In 1998 he was arrested twice for DWI. Those convictions earned him 10 years and 25 years in prison respectively. He was yet again released early from prison after only serving five years.His most recent offense occurred when a Hays County Sheriff's deputy observed Marin weaving while driving 75 miles-per-hour in a 45 mile-per-hour zone.In another case, James Dean Shaw, 44, received six life-sentences for his May 2015 arrest following a crash that left two people dead and another severely injured. Shaw failed to yield as he was turning into a liquor store and crashed into a Jeep Patriot driven by Mindy Beth Richardson, a woman from Hardin, Texas, who was 8-months pregnant at the time of the crash, the Houston Chronicle reported.Two of Shaw's passengers were killed in the crash. Gerald Lynn Potts, Jr., 21, was killed instantly and John Real, Jr., 13, had to be removed from life support 10 days after the crash. Real died six days before his 14th birthday. A third passenger in Shaw's car 13-year-old Joseph Winkelspecht, Jr., received a traumatic brain injury that left him hospitalized for several months. He is now confined to a wheelchair and is only now beginning to speak again.Richardson and her now 1-year-old son Cael survived the crash after Cael was delivered by emergency C-section.Shaw's previous DWI convictions included two in Polk County in the early-1990s, one in Navarro County in the mid-1990s, and two in Oklahoma in 2005 and 2007. He also has other criminal convictions for theft, deadly conduct, and felon in possession of a firearm.Another recent life-sentence for a multiply-convicted DWI offender was handed down in Montgomery County in June 2016. On May30, 2015, Donald Middleton, 56, crashed into a pickup truck driven by 16-year-old Joshua Hayden, the son of Montgomery County Precinct 4 Constable Rowdy Hayden, Engle reported for the Montgomery County Police Reporter.Knowing this was his 9th DWI offense, he fled the scene and tried to convince store clerks to hide them. The witnesses told Hayden who he had hit and he reportedly said he didn't care who he was. His pleas were caught on the store's security system 11 times. He had a blood alcohol level of .184 which is more than twice the legal limit in Texas. Despite his previous multiple DWI convictions, Middleton's Texas Driver License was still valid.Following Middleton's eighth DWI conviction in Harris County, he was sentenced to 13 years in a Texas prison.Following testimony during the sentencing hearing, 359th District Court Judge Kathleen Hamilton wasted no time in coming to a decision. Following a 30-minute contemplation, Judge Hamilton handed down the life-sentence.Surprisingly, Middleton's Texas Driver License was valid at the time of his 8th DWI offense. While Texas law allows a driver convicted of DWI to have their license to drive suspended for up to two years, there currently is no provision to allow the state to permanently revoke the license of someone convicted of multiple DWI offenses, the Houston Chronicle reported.The Houston Chronicle cited a report from Texas A&M University's Troy Walden, an expert on impaired driving, that stated fifty to seventy percent of offenders continue to drive even though their license  has been suspended.Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

In the conversation, he denied that he slept with the women on the list.Clinton was specifically reacting to Flowers recalling her response after she learned about the list of women. ""You know what I said? I said, 'At least he's an equal op...opportunity f*cker!'"" stated Flowers in the recording.In an interview airing Sunday with Breitbart News and this reporter's weekend talk radio program, Aaron Klein Investigative Radio, Flowers reacted to those two sections of the tapes, explaining she felt that Clinton was acting like a ""jackass"" and was being demeaning to women.Listen to the audio here (WARNING - Explicit Language): From December 1990 to December 1991, Flowers famously recorded a series of conversations with Clinton during the period he was Governor of Arkansas and considering a run for the presidency.On October 1991, Clinton announced his bid for the Oval Office, with rumors of extramarital affairs threatening to derail his campaign.Flowers recently provided this reporter with complete original cassette recordings of her taped conversations with Clinton, recordings that take on renewed significance as the issue of Clinton's alleged treatment of women has reemerged during the 2016 presidential campaign.Some sections of those tapes were provided to the news media in the 1990s. Over the years, other parts of the tapes were made public, but some of the contents received little news media attention.  Key segments of the tapes have largely not been properly vetted by the news media.MIKE NELSON/AFP/Getty ImagesBy December 1991, rumors were swirling around Arkansas and nationally that Clinton had had affairs with several women. During a portion of the tapes recorded that month, Clinton discussed claims about his relationship with one woman, whose name was deleted for privacy reasons.Here is a transcript of those remarks:GF: I talked to David Watkins. I have a little company with a guy named (name deleted) and (name deleted) called Concepts Plus, that does jingles...BC: Yeah. Beautiful (name deleted).GF: yes, beautiful...BC: The one I allegedly had an affair with?GF: B.B., (name deleted), uh, anyway. Beautiful (name deleted)...anyway...BC: The only time I ever saw her was at the inaugural. She was so good looking I wished it was true. (laughter)GF: Well she's very, she's very talented, too!BC: Is she?In a previous conversation, in December 1990, Clinton reacted to a list of five women with whom he was accused of having had affairs by joking, ""I've got good taste.""At issue was a lawsuit filed by former Clinton insider Larry Nichols, who claimed he was improperly dismissed by Clinton from a state job.  In the lawsuit, Nichols alleged that Clinton diverted state funds to engage in extramarital affairs with five women. He named Flowers and four others, including former Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen and former Miss Arkansas Lencola Sullivan. Nichols would later drop his lawsuit, but the charges helped form the basis for tabloid stories alleging that Clinton had extramarital affairs.During the recorded conversation with Flowers, Clinton recounted being read the list of women. He jokes, ""I've got good taste,"" and ""I kinda hate to deny that.""Here is a transcript of Clinton discussing the list:BC: Bill Simmons read me the list.  I said, ""God, Bill, I kinda hate to deny that!"" (laughter).GF: (laughter) You know what I said? I said, ""At least he's an equal op... opportunity f*cker!"" (laughter)BC: I've got good taste.In an interview recorded on Friday, Flowers said the recorded conversations took place after she ended the alleged affair with Clinton in 1989 because she started dating another man.Flowers said she thought that Clinton was trying to make her jealous by referring to other women as beautiful.Flowers responded to Clinton's assertion that ""she was so good looking I wished it was true,"" referring to one woman which whom he was accused of having had an affair.Reacted Flowers:""She was one of my best friends. And she is beautiful and she's smart and startling. And I'm like, you know, really? You can tell by the tone in my voice. I said well, yeah, she's not just beautiful, she's smart too.""Because, you know, it wasn't gross locker talk, but it was just kind of that tone. And it was irritating me because but not because it was making me jealous. It was just irritating me that he was doing it. Being disrespectful to her because, you know, she was a great person.""""Understand that when these tapes were made from the very beginning Bill and I were no longer seeing each other,"" Flowers added. ""And I felt like several times in those tapes he was trying to make me jealous because he was talking about other women. About being beautiful. And I clearly felt that he was trying to make me jealous. Because he had let me know that if I change my mind he was there.""Flowers further commented on the section of the tape in which Clinton stated ""I've got good taste"" in response to being read the list of five alleged mistresses.""Well, if I hadn't been recording him, I would have told him that he was a jackass,"" stated Flowers. ""That he could quit talking like that. You know, at that point, I didn't want to make myself look bad, but had I been able to really talk freely, I would have said, 'you can knock that off. It's not funny.'""She added, ""But there was a Miss America. There was a Miss Arkansas. Down there. So, you know, I got why he said that. It was an impressive group of ladies. I get it.""Flowers says she was Bill Clinton's mistress for 12-plus years.Flowers says she never sought to go public. Her name was put out there against her will as a result of the Nichols' lawsuit. Three days after Star Magazine mentioned Flowers as Clinton's alleged mistress, Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared in January 1992 side by side on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied a relationship with Flowers.Clinton later admitted to one sexual encounter with Flowers in a 1998 deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit.After Clinton denied the affair during the 60 Minutes interview, Flowers held a press conference the next day, where excerpts of the tapes were played. Some sections of those tapes were provided to the news media at the time.Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn an email correspondence cited by the Times of Israel and released by WikiLeaks last week, Clinton wrote foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan and campaign chairman John Podesta saying that a ""Potemkin process is better than nothing.""Clinton was responding to an earlier email from Sullivan on March 2015 who sent her a New York Times article about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's apology for his warning that ""Arab voters are going in droves to the polls"" in Israel's elections that year.Sullivan remarked with sarcasm: ""Unsurprisingly, Pragmatic Bibi makes an appearance,"" he wrote.""This is an opening that should be exploited,"" Clinton responded.A large percentage of the latest batch of emails posted by WikiLeaks last week deal with Israel.In another conversation, Stuart Eizenstat, former U.S. diplomat who is close with the Clintons, said that a senior Israeli officials had revealed to him that Netanyahu felt Clinton was ""more instinctively sympathetic to Israel than the White House.""Eizenstat said in the December 2015 email that according to the Israeli official, things were not as they seemed in the media. He was referring to a spat in 2010 when President Barack Obama ordered then-secretary of state Clinton to phone Netanyahu and scold him of housing plans in a Jerusalem neighborhood that lies beyond the Green Line.""The Prime Minister always had a 'surprising good relationship' with Hillary. 'She is easy to work with', and... she is more instinctively sympathetic to Israel than the White House,"" Eizenstat wrote. ""Even during their famous 43 minute phone call, when he felt like slamming down the phone, he felt she was simply heavily scripted and reading from points prepared by the White House.""The phone call's conversation was leaked to the media and showed Clinton berating Netanyahu saying his approval for the settlement building raised doubts about his commitments to peace.Eizenstat also said he and the Israeli official discussed ""possible economic initiatives to help the Palestinians,"" adding that ""the Prime Minister is genuinely interested in doing positive things on the ground."" But Netanyahu said he was not able to do so at present, according to Eizenstat, partly because of the White House's ambiguous position on a UN Security Council resolution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Meanwhile, a poll found that Israelis largely support Clinton over rival Donald Trump despite the fact that they believe the Democratic hopeful will pressure Israel to a greater extent on the Palestinian issue.41.8% of Israelis believe Clinton to be the better option for Israel compared to 23.9% for Trump, the new Peace Index released Sunday by the Israel Democracy Institute showed.However, some 57.2% of respondents (62.7% of Jewish Israelis, 30.1% of Arab Israelis) said Clinton ""will more heavily pressure the Israeli government to renew negotiations with the Palestinians if elected.""SIGN UP"

We need to fix this.""It's incomprehensible that our laws would protect gun makers over Sandy Hook families. We need to fix this. https://t.co/96uBe92wPi-- Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 15, 2016Think about the specifics of the Sandy Hook attack-the AR-15 that Adam Lanza used was legally manufactured by Bushmaster, which is owned by Remington Arms. The gun was legally sold as well and registered to Nancy Lanza, Adam's mother. Determined to do evil, Adam stole the gun from his mother-along with other guns as well-and shot and killed Nancy in her sleep. He then went to Sandy Hook Elementary on December 14, 2012, where he proceeded to shoot and kill 26 innocents.So the suit revolved around a gun that was acquired via thievery then misused in the most heinous way imaginable. Judge Bellis found the suit to be the frivolous type from which gun manufacturers are shielded by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), and she dismissed it. Clinton finds it ""incomprehensible"" that Remington Arms was protected from a suit under such conditions.Breitbart News previously reported that Clinton wants crime victims to be able to sue gun manufacturers for gun crime. She highlighted this on December 29, 2015, at a New Hampshire town hall, where she also made clear her belief that crime victims ought to be able to sue gun sellers as well.How long would the manufacturer and licensed seller of any well-known product be able to survive if they were suddenly held liable for the criminal misuse of their product? The answer-not very long. And this is why Bernie Sanders warned that Clinton's gun control proposals would end gun manufacturing in America if ever enacted.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

""He did spend 17 days in jail and he did lose his job,"" and will be on supervision for the rest of his life.McKeon said he decided not to go with the recommended sentence because the man had support from his family, the girl's mother and grandmother, friends, church, and his employer.Jensen said he disagreed with the sentence, but respected the judge's decision.McKeon is retiring next month after 22 years of serving as a state judge.SIGN UP"

Times Accuses Donald Trump of Dividing America	"The Los Angeles Times published an article Sunday accusing Republican presidential nominee of dividing America with what it called ""scorched-earth campaign,"" objecting to Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCiting an amorphous ""Many who have watched Trump's campaign,"" the Times' Noah Bierman alleges: ""The scorched-earth strategy Trump has adopted risks creating a lasting and bitter divide in American society."" He also worries that Trump's rhetoric will be imitated by others.The word ""Obama"" does not appear once in Bierman's article -- a significant omission, since the 44th president has done more to divide Americans than any of his recent predecessors. Obama has a history of violent rhetoric, telling supporters in 2008 to ""get in their faces"" and that ""If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun."" As president, he rammed Obamacare down the throats of the American people and repeatedly defied the Constitution -- most recently, and brazenly, on the Iran nuclear deal.Obama has also used race to divide Americans, most recently in his support for the Black Lives Matter movement. He has also exploited class divisions, praising the Occupy Wall Street movement and adopting its ""99% vs. 1%"" rhetoric in his re-election effort in 2012. It was Obama who accused his Republican rival in that contest, the strait-laced Gov. Mitt Romney, of killing a former employee's wife. Dividing the country and demonizing opponents has been the rule in Obama's presidency.Bierman also lets Clinton off the hook. Nowhere does he mention her comment that half of Trump's supporters are a ""basket of deplorables"" -- a comment for which she never actually apologized. Clinton has also used racial rhetoric throughout her campaign in an attempt to appeal to Black Lives Matter and its supporters. The day after five police officers were murdered in Dallas, Texas at a Black Lives Matter rally, she spoke about ""systemic racism"" and the need for white people to make amends. Clinton has also adopted Obama's divisive class war, running explicitly on a promise to soak the ""one percent"" with tax hikes.Laughably, Bierman cites -- with horror -- a Trump supporter who says she is willing to join a ""revolution"" if he loses. Yet Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) ran an entire presidential campaign on the promise of a ""political revolution,"" which the Times does not see fit to mention. Bremen also claims Trump ""casually threatened to jail his political opponent"" -- omitting, like many others in the mainstream media who feigned outrage at the second presidential debate, that Trump was referring to appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton's email scandal, which would have put any other American else in jail.Whenever a Republican candidate, or a movement, is effective, the mainstream media claim that the country is being divided, as it did after the Tea Party sweep of 2010.We are already a divided nation -- and the biased media have themselves to blame.Joel B.

Clinton opened up a four-point lead over her GOP rival Donald J. Trump in the campaign to win Florida and its 29 electoral votes, according to the Breitbart/Gravis poll conducted Oct. 11 through Oct. 13 with 1,799 registered voters.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERClinton was the choice of 46 percent to Trump's 42 percent, said Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, the Florida-based polling firm that conducted the poll. The poll carries a 2.3 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence.Kaplan said Libertarian Gary Johnson was the choice of two percent, Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein, one percent.""This is another state where we saw a shift away from Trump,"" he said.In our Oct. 4 poll, Clinton was up 47 to 45, but since then, Trump has lost support and Clinton has held hers, he said.In this poll, the presidential preference was asked once in the middle of the survey.""In a state Obama won by one percent in 2012, the Clinton camp will be celebrating this poll,"" he said.The next chance for Trump to recover his positive momentum is the Oct. 19 Presidential Debate held at University of Nevada-Las Vegas, Las Vegas, moderated by Fox News' Chris Wallace.""Can Trump pull an 'art of the comeback' with Fox host Chris Wallace as the debate host?-Of course,"" he said.The referendum to legalize marijuana for medical use is on the ballot and has the support of 54 percent of the voters with 35 percent opposed. In 2014, a similar referendum garnered 57 percent of the vote, falling just shy of the 60 percent threshold required for the referendum vote to become law.Kaplan said the marijuana poll numbers show a real gender gap.""The 'No' side is effective with suburban women, when they emphasize the effects of marijuana on children,"" he said.""It looks like it will pass this time, but barely,"" he said. ""We believe it will pass based on a younger demographic voting this year and a different campaign run by John Morgan."" Morgan is the founder and senior partner at Morgan and Morgan, a personal injury law firm with more than 300 attorneys in Florida and other states. Morgan has been the state's leading advocate for legalizing medical marijuana, but in the 2016 campaign, he has stepped away from the spotlight.Kaplan said Florida does have a libertarian streak that has become more significant in the last 10 years.In the Senate race, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio leads his Democratic rival Rep.

Twenty percent of the voters have a strongly favorable opinion of Rubio, just about the same as the 19 percent in the Oct. 4 poll.In the Oct. 4 poll, Murphy's strongly favorable was 13 percent and his strongly unfavorable 25 percent.Kaplan said, ""Rubio looks like he is in good shape.""""However, if you add his 17 percent somewhat unfavorable rating to his 33 percent strongly unfavorable-a 50 percent disapproval has to be concerning,"" he said.""Rubio has universal name approval. Murphy does not,"" he said. ""Murphy will try and ride Clinton's coat tails.

According to data from Pew Research Center, 83% of the American electorate would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.Clinton's declaration describing those who want to limit immigration as ""unAmerican"" came in the context of her urging action on ""immigration reform.""""Immigration reform is so important,"" Clinton told the Wall Street executives, as she demanded that Congress ""get immigration reform done.""By ""immigration reform,"" Clinton was referring to the 2013 Rubio-Schumer proposal, which she supported and which would have granted immediate amnesty and eventual citizenship to millions of illegal aliens, would have doubled the annual admission of foreign workers, and would have dispensed 33 million green cards to foreign nationals in the span of a single decade despite current record immigration levels.Clinton went on to suggest that those who oppose such dramatic expansions to immigration are ""fundamentally un-American"":What I really resent most about the obstructionists is they have such a narrow view of America. They see America in a way that is no longer reflective of the reality of who we are. They're against immigration for reasons that have to do with the past, not the future. They can't figure out how to invest in the future, so they cut everything. You know, laying off, you know, young researchers, closing labs instead of saying, we're better at this than anybody in the world, that's where our money should go. They just have a backward-looking view of America. And they play on people's fears, not on people's hopes, and they have to be rejected. I don't care what they call themselves. I don't care where they're from. They have to be rejected because they are fundamentally unAmerican.""This is not the first time she has described sectors of the American electorate as ""unAmerican."" At a September fundraiser earlier this year, Clinton described Trump supporters as ""deplorable,"" and ""irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America,"" Clinton said.During her Goldman Sachs speech, Clinton went on to argue that being ""American"" is not a national identity, but rather is ""an intellectual invention.""""American was an invention,"" Clinton declared. ""It was an intellectual invention, and we have done pretty well for all these years. And these people want to just undermine that very profound sense of who we are. And we can't let them do that. So it's not just about politics or partisanship. It really goes to the heart of what it means to be American.""Clinton's declaration seems to echo a sentiment that has been expressed by mass migration enthusiast Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.Paul Ryan, like Clinton, has previously suggested that America is not a country or a national identity, but is rather an intellectual idea.""America is more than just a country,"" Ryan said just a few months before Clinton delivered her speech to Goldman Sachs. ""It's more than Chicago, or Wisconsin. It's more than our borders. America is an idea. It's a very precious idea.""Ryan's statement came as he was stumping for the Rubio-Schumer immigration agenda in 2013 with open borders advocate Luis Gutierrez, who has since endorsed Hillary Clinton for President over Donald Trump. Gutierrez was also one of the first members of Congress to endorse Ryan for House Speaker-Gutierrez has called Ryan his ""good friend"" and ""guiding light"" on immigration.Ryan's statement is significant because while a country has borders, ""ideas"" do not. If America is an ""idea"" rather than a ""country"" that means that refugees in Somali have as much ""right"" to a job in the United States as the children of the American revolution.Indeed, like Clinton, Speaker Ryan has a long record of pushing to expand record-high immigration levels and advocating for open borders. This goal is shared by Hillary Clinton, who went so far as to privately tell foreign bankers that her ""dream"" was to enact ""open borders.""Several reports have documented how immigration is not the only issue of agreement between Paul Ryan and Hillary Clinton. As Breitbart News has extensively documented, Ryan's views on foreign migration, foreign trade, and foreign wars more closely align with the views of Hillary Clinton than they do with the views of Donald Trump and the Republican electorate. Indeed, Sen. Tim Kaine has predicted that Speaker Ryan will be the key to passing a President Hillary Clinton's agenda-including enacting the largest amnesty in U.S. history within her first 100 days in office.The overwhelming similarities between the goals of establishment leaders in both political parties and the goals of their wealthy corporate donors, like Goldman Sachs, recently prompted Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein to denounce Hillary Clinton as a ""corporatist"" and the face of ""#TheNewRepublicanParty.""""Both Democrats and Republicans are funded by big corporate interests,"" Stein has written, noting that these members of Washington's ""uniparty"" are united in their shared desire to advance the goals of their wealthy donors rather than the desires of the people.Bernie Sanders has previously explained how open borders-backed by both Clinton and Ryan-is a ""Koch brothers proposal"" that would dissolve national sovereignty and ""would make everybody in America poorer"" by allowing corporations to ""bring in all kinds of people [who would] work for $2 or $3 an hour"" and would drive down wages for American workers.By Bernie Sanders' own argument, Hillary Clinton's ""dream"" is to enact a policy that would ""make everybody in America poorer"" and would do ""away with the concept of [the United States as] a nation state.""As a result of current federal policy, every year the U.S. issues one million plus new green cards; admits one million foreign workers, refugees, and dependents; and imports half a million foreign youths sought by college administrators. In 1970, fewer than one in 21 Americans were foreign-born, but today, as a result of the federal government's four-decade-long green card gusher, nearly one in seven U.S. residents was born in a foreign country.Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has explained that, far from being ""fundamentally unAmerican,"" recognizing limits and curbing immigration to protect American jobs and wages is ""rational"" and is the ""mainstream"" view held by most Americans.""It is not mainstream, but extreme, to continue surging immigration beyond all historical precedent. And it is not rational, but radical, to refuse to recognize limits,"" Sessions has explained.Sessions has previously noted that Clinton's desire to expand immigration beyond all-known historical precedent place her at odds with the vast majority of the American electorate. ""Hillary Clinton has embraced a radical and extreme open borders agenda that, properly exposed, will make her un-electable,"" Sessions has said.What I really resent most about the obstructionists is they have such a narrow view of America. They see America in a way that is no longer reflective of the reality of who we are. They're against immigration for reasons that have to do with the past, not the future. They can't figure out how to invest in the future, so they cut everything. You know, laying off, you know, young researchers, closing labs instead of saying, we're better at this than anybody in the world, that's where our money should go.

Trump with 44 percent of the vote to Trump's 39 percent in the fight for Colorado's nine electoral votes, according to the Breitbart/Gravis poll conducted Oct. 12 and Oct. 13 with 1,226 registered Colorado voters.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""In our last poll, conducted Oct. 3 through Oct. 4, Hillary Clinton and Trump were locked up at 40 percent, so we see the aftereffects of a crazy Columbus Day weekend,"" said Doug Kaplan, managing partner of Gravis Marketing, the Florida-based polling firm that executed the poll. The poll carries a margin of error of 2.8 percent with a 95 percent level of confidence.""We see a significant shift in Colorado, which is important this late in the campaign,"" he said. ""If Clinton holds on and wins the state, she owes it to to college-educated white women.""Libertarian Gary Johnson was the choice of six percent of the voters and Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein was the choice of two percent.Kaplan said, ""There are reasons to think that the Republicans have a shot at Colorado in 2016. President Barack Obama beat Romney 51 percent to 46 percent."" In 2012, the GOP nominee was former Massachusetts governor W. Mitt Romney. In 2008, Obama beat GOP nominee Sen. John S. McCain III (R.-Ariz.).Trump has not given up on Colorado. The billionaire will visit the Grand Junction Tuesday for an airport rally. The airport rally is one of the most accurate signals of what a campaign sees as an opportunity to attack or a need to defend. As the presidential campaign reaches its closing days, airport rallies will increasingly dominate each campaign's calendar as both Trump and Clinton convert the country into a 3,000-mile wide chessboard.Both Trump and Clinton have high unfavorables in the poll.Twenty-one percent of voters have a strongly favorable opinion of the New York City developer, with 55 percent saying they have a strongly unfavorable opinion of him.Twenty-three percent of the voters have a strongly favorable opinion of the former first lady, with 51 percent saying they had a strongly unfavorable opinion of her.Because the poll was taken after the Oct. 7 release of a lewd tape of Trump speaking in direct language about his failed courtship of a married woman and his experience with women who want to spend time with celebrities, the poll asked Colorado voters if they accepted the apology from the Republican nominee. Thirty-nine percent of the respondents said they accepted it, but 54 percent said they did not.The poll also revealed an electorate unhappy with the state of affairs. Asked about the direction the country was going, 35 percent said it was going in the right direction and 57 said it was going in the wrong direction.When the voters were asked if Obamacare was a success or failure, only 33 percent said it was a success and 56 percent said it was not.Although the majority of voters polled agreed with the positions of Trump, only 38 percent agreed that America should build a wall along the Mexican border and 53 said we should not.This does not mean that Colorado is at ease with illegal immigration.Participants were also asked: How concerned are you with controlling immigration and securing the southern border? Sixty-nine percent said they were concerned, when you combine the 42 percent who were very concerned and 27 percent who were somewhat concerned. Only 24 percent said they were not concerned.For perspective, there is a 25-percentage-point margin advantage for the concerned position compared to the percentage of voters supporting Clinton.In the Colorado Senate race, Democrat Sen. Michael Bennet leads the GOP challenger Darryl Glenn with 48 percent to the Republican's 38 percent of the voters.The poll was conducted using a combination of automated telephone calls and an internet panel of cellphone users with the results weighted to match a proprietary turnout model.Current Colorado Polling 10:13:16 by Breitbart News on ScribdSIGN UP"

According to the 2010 census, 79 percent of Planned Parenthood's surgical abortion facilities are located within walking distance of black or Hispanic neighborhoods.Some 59 million abortions have been performed in the country since the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, nearly 18 million of them on black babies. As Breitbart News has reported, the Alan Guttmacher Institute also provided data showing that about 30 percent of all abortions in the U.S. are performed on black women, with another 25 percent performed on Hispanic women.Perhaps the most stirring statistic comes from New York City, where more black babies are aborted than are born.Sanger was committed to ensuring every woman could control her own life. But like most visionaries, she was flawed: https://t.co/53HaXVZ3iS pic.twitter.com/7rYqHlcjvn-- Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) October 14, 2016Planned Parenthood has been under congressional investigation for the past year following allegations that it profits from the sale of the body parts of babies it aborts in its clinics.As part of its desperate scheme to defend itself against the allegations, the abortion business has gone so far out of the mainstream of America that it has cemented a relationship with the far-left LGBT agenda, and now even offers ""transgender hormone treatments"" at its clinics.In an attempt to shore up its support from black women, Planned Parenthood is relying on an alliance with Black Lives Matter and similar black activist groups, even to the extent of contorting BLM's claim that law enforcement is racist against blacks into a new social justice cause called ""reproductive justice"" (#ReproJustice ). Once again - it's all about abortion for Planned Parenthood.Justice for #MikeBrown is #ReproJustice. None are safe until we all can be free from violence. h/t @SisterSong_WOC https://t.co/qIfBNcIke7-- Planned Parenthood (@PPact) August 9, 2016Black Christians will have none of it, however.Baltimore Ravens tight end Ben Watson commented on Sanger's bigotry in August.""I do know that blacks kind of represent a large portion of the abortions,"" Watson told TurningPointFriends.org, ""and I do know that honestly the whole idea with Planned Parenthood and [founder Margaret] Sanger in the past was to exterminate blacks, and it's kind of ironic that it's working.""Retired NFL Super Bowl champion Burgess Owens backed up Watson.""Sanger looked at blacks as 'weeds,'"" Owens told Breitbart News, adding that the NAACP was complicit in the decimation of the black community through abortion:The NAACP was not a black-run, black-originated organization. It was run by 21 white, socialist, atheist, Marxist Democrats. It was the antithesis of Rev. Martin Luther King Sr.'s community at that time, which was capitalist, Christian, very pro-life, and pro-America. So, these 21 white people began to put a message through to the black community that Democrats were good, liberalism was good, and they subscribed to the same philosophy that Margaret Sanger believed of blacks at that time.Sanger, who began the Negro Project in 1939 and worked to bring birth control to blacks in an effort to reduce their population, joined with elite and well known African-Americans Mary McLeod Bethune, W.E.B. DuBois, and Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, Sr. The Negro Project was sold as a solution to poverty and high birth rates among the black community. At the same time Sanger promoted her theory of ""eliminating the unfit,"" she also condemned charitable organizations that she believed were elevating the very population that needed to be weeded out.""If you wonder why urban, young, black women are allowing themselves to be victimized by Planned Parenthood, look at BET [Black Entertainment Television], which is owned by very wealthy white Democrats,"" Owens urged. ""Look at the 15 years of messaging that has been gotten through to our urban black communities: anti-white, anti-police, anti-family, and pro-abortion.""""Forty percent of black babies have been given to the altar of abortion,"" he observed. ""In any other society, that would be considered genocide.

""And I will say - consistently and proudly - Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported, and appreciated; not undermined, misrepresented, and demonized.""Clinton, who also said unborn babies have no constitutional rights, added that women have the right to abortion.""Any right that requires you to take measures to access it, is no right at all,"" she said, ""not as long as we have laws on the books like the Hyde Amendment, making it harder for low-income women to exercise their full rights.""Celebrate with us on 10/16/16!

-- Planned Parenthood (@PPact) August 9, 2016The NAACP was not a black-run, black-originated organization. It was run by 21 white, socialist, atheist, Marxist Democrats. It was the antithesis of Rev. Martin Luther King Sr.'s community at that time, which was capitalist, Christian, very pro-life, and pro-America. So, these 21 white people began to put a message through to the black community that Democrats were good, liberalism was good, and they subscribed to the same philosophy that Margaret Sanger believed of blacks at that time.And Planned Parenthood's founder lived until 1966--hardly the stone ages--and continued to spout bigotry and promote eugenics until the very end.

She pointed a gun at him and demanded money. Noel remained calm and looked for an opportunity to act. He said, ""At this time, I'm thinking to find any second to attack her or change the situation and then jump on the table and jump on her.""Noel handed her some cash and the suspect laid down her gun to grab the money. At that point, Noel took the gun and jumped over the counter. He wrestled with the suspect, who was able to get her hand on the gun and fire a shot. The shot missed Noel, who said, ""When me and her were fighting on the floor, she tried to shoot me. I made a move and the shot went to the air and the hallway of the hotel.""A hotel guest helped the clerk by grabbing the gun as the struggle continued. The guest then called 911 and said, ""Hey y'all need to come up here to the Victory Suites hotel. They just shot a **expletive** gun. I got the **expletive** gun. They up here shootin'!""Although the suspect ultimately escaped, the hotel clerk said he is glad he fought back.

In the speeches, Clinton admits that the current political system is designed to protect party establishments, she suggests reworking Senate rules to undercut opposition to Democrats, and states that incumbents tend to not have ""the full interests of the people,"" among other revelations. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAt a private paid speech, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein asked now-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton if the American political system should be entirely scrapped and replaced with a parliamentary system.""But just a general question to start you off on the domestic situation. Is the American political system just hopeless? Should we just throw it away, start over?"" Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein asked on October 29, 2013, during the ""Builders and Innovators Summit."" He went on:You know, go home. Get a parliamentary system. Is it--because I will tell you--I'm kidding. We--talking here, and I didn't do this in a formal survey, but when we ask entrepreneurs, whether they were social entrepreneurs, the people who were talking represented the work they're doing in the cities and the businesses represented here, every conversation referred to either what the government was doing or what the government wasn't doing that it was obvious that they should be doing.And then I guess a corollary question to my first approach, should we chuck it away, will the elections make a differences. The system so gummed up where a single senator can so gum up appointments and basically extort legislation or stop legislation, is the system so screwed up now that really that we just have to have some cataclysm that just gets everybody so frustrated that we de facto start over, you know, or practically start over?Clinton replied that the politics in Washington, D.C. were ""dysfunctional"" during Obama's second term, especially regarding the government shutdown. She said:Well, look, I--I think that everyone agrees that we're in a bad patch in our political system and in Washington. It's--you know, there's a lot of good things happening elsewhere in the country. There are a lot of mayors, you had Mitch Landrieu here, I was with Rahm Emanuel yesterday. There's a lot of innovative, interesting, new ideas being put into practice by mayors, by some governors. So I think when we talk about our political system, we're really focusing more on what's happening in Washington. And it is dysfunctional right now. And it is for a variety of reasons, some of them systemic, as you suggested.Clinton endorsed changing the rules of the Senate so a determined group of Republicans couldn't hold up the confirmation of presidential appointees. She said:You know, I really have come to believe that we need to change the rules in the Senate, having served there for eight years. It's only gotten more difficult to do anything. And I think nominees deserve a vote up or down. Policies deserve a vote up or down. And I don't think that a small handful of senators should stand in the way of that, because, you know, a lot of those senators are really obstructionist. They should get out. They should make their case. They should go ahead and debate. But they shouldn't be able to stop the action of the United States Senate. So I think there does have to be some reworking of the rules, particularly in the Senate.I think that, as has been discussed many times, the partisan drawing of lines in Congressional districts gives people -- gives incumbents certainly a lot more protection than an election should offer. And then they're only concerned about getting a challenge from the left of the Democratic Party or a challenge from the right in the Republican Party. And they're not representing really the full interests of the people in the area that they're supposed to be.California moved toward this non-partisan board, and I think there should be more efforts in states to do that and get out of the ridiculous gerrymandering that has given us so many members who don't really care what is happening in the country, don't really care what the facts are. They just care whether they get a primary opponent.And then it comes down to who we vote for and what kind of expectations we set and who we give money to. Those who help to fund elections, I think it's important that business leaders make it clear, why would you give money to somebody who was willing to wreck the full faith and credit of the United States. I mean, that just makes no sense at all because the economic repercussions would have been very bad, and the long-term consequences with, you know, the Chinese saying, let's de-Americanize the world and eventually move to a different reserve currency wouldn't be, you know, beneficial, either. So I think there are steps that citizens have to take. It's not just about how we rearrange the levers of power and the institutions in Washington.""But there has to be a new ethos,"" Clinton added. ""I mean, we can't let people, as you say, be extortionists. And the President was absolutely right not to negotiate with people who were acting the way that the minority of the minority was acting on the shutdown and the debt limit issue.""You know, go home. Get a parliamentary system. Is it--because I will tell you--I'm kidding. We--talking here, and I didn't do this in a formal survey, but when we ask entrepreneurs, whether they were social entrepreneurs, the people who were talking represented the work they're doing in the cities and the businesses represented here, every conversation referred to either what the government was doing or what the government wasn't doing that it was obvious that they should be doing.

Here's the Cleveland Plain Dealer on Wednesday:Borges had just hung up with Trump when cleveland.com reached the chairman by telephone Wednesday morning. He shared details of their three discussions since Sunday.What did they talk about Wednesday?""I told him we have a path to carry Ohio, so let's just stick together,"" Borges said.""He said, 'OK, I love ya.'""But that wasn't true, and in fact it was some kind of head fake to Trump, Ohio tea party activist Tom Zawistowski told Breitbart News.""The entire State Central Committee was handpicked by Kasich and Borges,"" Zawistowski said, referring to Borges as John Kasich's right-hand man, or consigliere.""Fox News had Borges on, on, like, Thursday afternoon, asking him, 'What did Trump tell you after the tape came out!' The guy is a bald faced liar! He always has been,"" Zawistowski said of Borges. ""He wasn't talking to Trump. We've been dealing with him ever since he won in a rigged election.""Zawistowski said that state party operatives are ""spying"" on the Trump campaign through the new shared Trump-Pence Victory Centers.The Trump campaign has had enough.Trump's Ohio campaign chief Bob Paduchik wrote a letter to the state party on Trump-Pence stationery cutting off all ties with Borges and accusing him of trying to get elected chairman of the Republican National Committee while sandbagging Trump:""The Trump-Pence slate of electors was unanimously approved by the Ohio GOP State Central Committee on September 9th and it has been disappointing that Chairman Matt Borges cannot support that decision,"" Paduchik wrote.""This past week Chairman Borges conducted a self-promotional media tour with state and national outlets to criticize our party's nominee. I have no idea what game he was playing. Some Ohio Republicans have described it as disgraceful, I find it utterly bizarre.""""I spoke with Mr. Trump on Thursday and he is very disappointed in Matt's duplicity. Mr. Trump told me, ""this is why people have lost faith in the establishment and party leaders.""""It's no great secret that Chairman Borges was never fully on board, but his actions over the last week demonstrate that his loyalties to Governor John Kasich's failed Presidential campaign eclipse his responsibility as Chairman of the Ohio Republican Party.""""For the record, Chairman Borges has routinely exaggerated his relationship with the candidate and the campaign. Chairman Borges does not represent or speak for the candidate and he no longer has any affiliation with the Trump-Pence campaign.""Paduchik vowed to fight on with the help of county party chairs operating below the state party level.Activist Zawistowski told Breitbart News that the state party is shutting down Trump campaigning in Lucas County, Ohio.""At the Lucas County Victory Center for Trump,"" Zawistowski said. ""They're literally telling people, don't take Trump materials with you when you go out door to door.""""The guy is literally a thug,"" Zawistowski says of Borges.Breitbart News has obtained an emergency alert sent out by Trump activist Rebecca Clutter in Medina County, where the Kasich establishment is also shutting down the Trump force:ZERO Trump lit is going out at the ORP scheduled ""walks"" in Medina, Brunswick and Wadsworth.

Breitbart News reported:Trump's victory over Kasich was cemented Tuesday when the Ohio Republican Party blasted out a press release announcing that the Trump-Pence ticket had opened 32 new ""Victory Centers"" in the state, and the centers are to be controlled by Trump-Pence. That's significant because Ohio's ""Victory Centers,"" which volunteers and staffers operate out of, used to be controlled by the state party. For a long time even after Trump became the presumptive nominee, those Victory Centers were getting out the vote for Senate candidate Rob Portman but not for Trump.In mid-August, shortly after activists caught some state party officials trying to get signatures to help Libertarian Gary Johnson, the game changed.
