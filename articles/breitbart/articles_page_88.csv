In the wake of these recent media reports, here are five devastating Obamacare facts every American should know.1. 17 of the nation's 23 Obamacare co-ops have already collapsed.2. Obamacare Premiums Continue to Skyrocket Over 50 Percent3. 8.1 Million Americans Have Already Been Slapped with $1.7 Billion in Obamacare Penalties4. Obamacare's Soaring Deductibles Have Rendered People's Health Plans Useless5. Even Bill Clinton and the Liberal NYT Agree Obamacare is BustedSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROnly six of the 23 co-ops launched nationwide remain, according to The Baltimore Sun.The other 17 are closed or are in the process of winding down because they cannot ""attract enough members, draw enough premium revenue and withstand the weight of new and costly regulatory hurdles created under the health reform law,"" The Sun reported.In Minnesota, Breitbart News previously reported that the state is allowing Obamacare premiums to increase by at least 50 percent all the way up to 67 percent in order to keep insurers from leaving the exchanges due to financial losses.For tax returns for the year 2015, 8.1 million Americans received fines from Obamacare's individual mandate that averaged $210 per tax return, totaling $1.7 billion, according to Investor's Business Daily.Over the eight years of Obama's presidency, high deductibles went from being the minority to becoming standard.According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 18 percent of covered workers in 2008 had a deductible of at least $1,000, up from only 10 percent in 2006.  For workers with employer-sponsored plans at small firms, 35 percent had deductibles of $1,000 or more in 2008, up from 16 percent in 2006.In 2016, 51 percent of all covered workers, and 65 percent of workers in small firms, face deductibles of at least $1,000, TIME reported. ""Workers at smaller firms must pay an average of $2,069 out of pocket before insurance payments kick in, versus $1,238 for workers at firms with 200 or more employees,"" the article reported.Former president Bill Clinton called Obamacare ""the craziest thing in the world"" at a rally Tuesday.""So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world,"" Clinton said.The New York Times, in an article Sunday, even said the law has to change in order to be viable.In the wake of Obamacare's disastrous overtaking of America's healthcare system, progressives now say that the only way to fix the broken Obamacare system is for government to seize even more control and move toward a total takeover, or the so-called ""public option.""Yet with Americans suffering from facts like the five above, they will likely have little stomach for more of the same big government policies that created the mess in the first place.SIGN UP"

The conversation generally focused on Clinton's plan to provide federal support for women who are struggling with low-paying jobs, with raising their children, and with gun violence in their neighborhoods. Clinton also said she empathizes with black mothers dealing with law enforcement targeting their children.The former secretary of state said across America women are telling her they need help from the government to pay for their childcare so they can work. Clinton said the governments of so many other advanced countries provide more for women and that, as president, she would work to ensure the United States provides paid family leave and sick days as well.""It should not be so hard to be a young parent,"" Clinton said. ""And it should not be so hard on the other end of the age spectrum to take care of your loved one.""Banks said that, while on the campaign trail, Clinton describes these issues as ""quiet problems"" that tend to keep mothers up worrying at night. Clinton specifically mentioned problems with addictions and mental health issues in families.""People say, 'I can't get the help I need for myself, my spouse, my child,'"" she said. ""There's just not enough help.""""Two-thirds of all minimum-wage earners are women,"" Clinton said. ""And most of them have children.""Attempting to convey an image of herself as a woman other women want to confide in, Clinton said that while voters do ask her questions about ""what's in the headlines,"" they very often want to talk to her about ""what keeps them up at night.""""Women tell me these stories about how hard it is,"" she continued. ""They tell me not only do they have no paid family leave, they have no earned sick days.""Clinton said the nurse who cared for Chelsea and her newborn in the hospital told her women come in to have babies on a Monday but then must return to work by Thursday or Friday of the same week, or else lose their jobs.Clinton added that women have so many stresses on them - from affordable childcare to how to make college affordable.""All of these are issues people have raised with me,"" she said, adding that, as president, she hopes to ""ease some of that burden.""Banks asked Chelsea Clinton about her relationship with her mother, and Chelsea responded that she is ""fiercely proud"" of her and emphasized that her mother is the grandmother of her own two children.""I wish that people really understood that stronger together, that putting families and children first, isn't rhetorical for my mom,"" she said.Chelsea said she is happy to travel and campaign for her mother, though she misses her daughter when she is on the road. She said she can travel with her infant son because she is ""breastfeeding,"" and received a round of applause after she announced she is open about breastfeeding and that there is nothing wrong with it.During the question and answer segment of the forum, one 15-year-old girl told Clinton she, like many girls her age, is concerned about ""body image"" and has seen ""with my own eyes the damage [Republican nominee] Donald Trump has done when he talks about women and how they look."" The teen asked Clinton how she plans to ""undo some of that damage"" as the first female president.""I'm so proud of you for asking that question!"" Clinton exclaimed to the teen, thanking her profusely and adding that, ""Young women are getting messages from the media"" earlier that they should be more concerned with their appearance than their minds.""My opponent insulted Miss Universe!"" Clinton laughed as she spoke. ""I mean how do you get more acclaimed than that? But it wasn't good enough.""""We need to laugh at it. We need to refute it. We need to ignore it. We need to stand up to it,"" she said, calling for an end to women being bullied.""We're not all gonna end up in Miss Universe, I hate to tell you,"" Clinton said, and added that women can be the best they can be in other ways, a statement that drew further applause.""Let's be proud of who we are, and let's support other women and girls and be proud of who they are,"" she urged to more applause.A town commissioner asked Clinton how she would support education at the local level. Clinton responded she has ""thought a lot about"" what happens at the local level.""I want to be the best possible partner of local communities,"" Clinton said, recalling aloud how her husband, when he was president, started federal dollars flowing to communities for police training and rehabilitating school buildings.One of Clinton's campaign methods has been to present herself as the ""maternal federal government,"" swooping in to save the downtrodden from the nasty state governments that refuse to support local communities.Painting the state legislatures as the enemies of local schools, particularly in inner cities, Clinton said many school districts are being ""starved by state governments.""""It takes a village, but the village has to be there for people,"" Clinton said, promising more federal spending in local governments.Chelsea Clinton added that schools should receive more financial support for teaching ""pro-social"" and anti-bullying behavior.When one young teen proudly told Clinton that she played the role of the Democrat nominee during a class debate and won against another student who played Donald Trump, Clinton congratulated her for winning the debate and said, ""That's 2 and 0 now!""The young girl then asked Clinton to explain more about her plan for ""debt-free college.""Clinton again slammed the state legislatures for choosing to build more prisons instead of providing more funding for universities so that students can reduce their loan debt.""The more you invest in higher education, the more prepared the work force will be,"" Clinton said, promising to let the federal government take on a greater role in funding college.Clinton also pushed her goal of achieving a National Service force of volunteers, much like a civilian National Reserve, and said that those who volunteer to serve will be granted student loan forgiveness.Chelsea Clinton also said she hopes, as president, her mother will be able to bring about automatic voter registration when Americans turn 18 ""to encourage more participation"" in elections. Clinton said young people ask her continually about criminal justice reform, student loan debt, and climate change, and they should be able to automatically vote when they turn 18 for leaders who will do what's right on these issues.With the emphasis still on mothers and children, Clinton and her daughter talked about the importance of federal investment in well-child care and pregnancy care, stating that more women are dying during pregnancy, labor, and immediately after childbirth. Clinton expressed concern about the lack of pre-natal care.""We have to look at the whole life cycle,"" Clinton said, ""And I am committed to doing everything I can to keep the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) alive, and to improve the Affordable Care Act.""Ironically, what neither Clinton nor her daughter discussed is that one of the Democrat nominee's main supports is the abortion industry. If elected president, Clinton has promised to provide even greater funding to Planned Parenthood and to eliminate the Hyde Amendment - a federal provision that bars taxpayer funding of abortions. Clinton says she wants the Hyde Amendment repealed so that more low-income women can obtain abortions easily.""An amazing conversation,"" Banks said to both Clintons at the end of the forum. Banks specifically thanked Hillary Clinton for fighting for children and families ""your entire adult life.""SIGN UP"

In that scenario, Libertarian Gary Johnson draws 6%, while the Green Party's Jill Stein gets 2%, even though she did not qualify for the North Carolina ballot and must appear as a write-in candidate.Five percent of North Carolina voters remain undecided.Forty-five percent of respondents said their support for Clinton increased after the first presidential debate, while only 30% said the same for Donald Trump.Pollster J. Ann Selzer nevertheless said North Carolina is ""the kind of situation where third-party candidates could tip the balance.""""It's hard to imagine a battleground state where things could be much closer, both in the overall horse-race number and in the underlying party ideology of the voters,"" Selzer said.""In the two-way presidential race, Clinton receives support from 88 percent of the state's black voters, a group that represented 20 percent of the likely electorate in the survey. Exit polls in 2012 showed blacks casting 23 percent of the state's ballots and Obama receiving 96 percent of their votes,"" Bloomberg reports.Clinton also leads among urban residents, young voters, women, and voters with a college degree, while Trump leads among rural voters, evangelical Christians, and white men without a college degree. He is ahead with the latter group by 51 points, while Clinton leads by 67 points with non-white voters.Trump and Clinton are both underwater on approval with North Carolina voters. His favorable numbers are 44%-53%, while hers are 46%-52%.The North Carolina Senate race is also close, with Democrat Deborah Ross currently leading Republican Richard Burr by 2 points, 46% to 44%.

A total of 1,893 refugees were resettled in the state during the most recent fiscal year that ended on September 30.A local resettlement agency, Exodus Refugee, sued Indiana to obtain funding for the Syrian refugees sent to it by the federal government and resettled in the state without the consent of the state government. Exodus Refugee is the local affiliate of two of the largest voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) currently operating in the lucrative resettlement industry which receives more than $1 billion in federal funding each year -- Church World Service and Episcopal Migration Ministries.The news came just one day before Indiana Gov. Mike Pence,  Republican nominee Donald Trump's running mate, and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's running mate, square off in Tuesday's first and only vice-presidential debate.The issue of Syrian refugee resettlement could be a significant topic in tonight's debate, which will be moderated by Elaine Quijano of CBS News.Recent polls indicate that a vast majority of voters oppose increasing the number of Syrian refugees resettled in the United States. The topic, however, was not raised in the first presidential debate between Trump and Clinton. Should Quijano raise the issue, citing the recent court decision, or should either Pence or Kaine address it, it could prove to be one of several potential flash points in the debate.""The [Seventh Circuit District Court] upheld a lower court judge in barring Pence from interfering with the distribution of federal funds to resettle Syrian refugees in his state. The appeals court panel said that federal law bars discrimination based on nationality,"" NPR reported:In a unanimous opinion, the appeals court said Gov. Pence acted illegally in accepting federal money for refugee resettlement and then refusing to use that money to aid Syrian refugees.The panel rejected Pence's argument that terrorists are posing as Syrian refugees to gain entry into the U.S., calling it a ""nightmare speculation"" based on no evidence. Indeed, the court said, the state presented no evidence that any Syrian refugee had been involved in a terrorist act in the U.S.The court added that resettlement of persecuted refugees is a federal responsibility under the 1980 Refugee Act, which authorizes the president to determine, on the basis of ""humanitarian concerns or ... the national interest,"" how many refugees to admit each year. . .But with Syrian refugees, the state of Indiana refused to use any of the refugee resettlement money it had received from the federal government. Exodus, a private resettlement group that contracted with the state, went to court, represented by the ACLU. It argued that the state's refusal was illegal discrimination.""Pence argued that the state's position was not based on discrimination but on the threat that Syrian refugees pose to the safety of residents of Indiana,"" but Judge Richard Posner, ""Writing for the court . . .  called Pence's argument 'the equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they're black but because he's afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive, he isn't discriminating.' "" NPR reported:Posner went on to add that ""that of course would be racial discrimination, just as [Pence's] targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.""Joining the decision were Judges Frank Easterbrook and Diane Sykes. . . Easterbrook and Posner were appointed by President Reagan, and Sykes was appointed by President George W. Bush. . . Sykes is on Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees.Though appointed by Reagan, Judge Posner's track record is more aligned with liberals than conservatives of late. He recently wrote that he ""sees 'absolutely no value' in studying the U.S. Constitution because 'eighteenth-century guys' couldn't have possibly foreseen the culture and technology of today.""In a recent op-ed for Slate, Judge Posner, a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, argued that the original Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the post-Civil War amendments ""do not speak to today.""""I see absolutely no value to a judge of spending decades, years, months, weeks, day, hours, minutes, or seconds studying the Constitution, the history of its enactment, its amendments, and its implementation (across the centuries -- well, just a little more than two centuries, and of course less for many of the amendments),"" he wrote. ""Eighteenth-century guys, however smart, could not foresee the culture, technology, etc., of the 21st century.""He added, ""let's not let the dead bury the living.""Judge Posner, an outspoken opponent of late Justice Antonin Scalia, also blasted ""absurd"" posthumous encomia for the late conservative.""I worry that law professors are too respectful of the Supreme Court, in part perhaps because they don't want to spoil the chances of their students to obtain Supreme Court clerkships,"" he wrote. ""I think the Supreme Court is at a nadir.The court apparently did not take into account significant evidence that Syrian refugees in Europe have engaged in terrorist activity there. In June, for instance, Germany arrested three suspected Syrian terrorists.Nor, apparently, did the court take into account FBI Director James Comey's recent admission that there is evidence the September 17 attack on ten Americans by a Somali refugee at a Minnesota mall was motivated by ""inspiration from radical Islamist groups.""Under the court's logic, Indiana could, arguably, sue to end the resettlement of Somali refugees now.The court also did not address the public health risk posed to the general public in Indiana by refugees from all countries.As Breitbart News reported previously, four refugees who arrived in Indiana in FY 2015 were diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB). Twenty-six percent of refugees resettled in Indiana that year tested positive for latent tuberculosis infection.Indiana is one of thirty-four states that have joined and not yet withdrawn from the federal refugee resettlement program. Texas recently became the thirteenth state to withdraw from the program. In those states, as well as two states that have handed over operation to the federal government but technically remain in the program, the federal government has selected resettlement agencies to operate the program under the statutorily questionable Wilson Fish alternative program.Tennessee, which has withdrawn from the federal refugee resettlement program, intends to sue the federal government on Tenth Amendment grounds, an argument that would be available to Indiana should it withdraw from the program.Though the appeals court ruled that a state participating in the federal refugee resettlement program may not withhold federally administered funds from any group resettled within its jurisdiction, even the Washington Post conceded in a recent op-ed that a President Trump would have every legal right to do so.In a unanimous opinion, the appeals court said Gov. Pence acted illegally in accepting federal money for refugee resettlement and then refusing to use that money to aid Syrian refugees.
The panel rejected Pence's argument that terrorists are posing as Syrian refugees to gain entry into the U.S., calling it a ""nightmare speculation"" based on no evidence.

Efforts to revive the baby were temporarily successful. Nonetheless, the child died at a Phoenix hospital several days later when life support was removed.Police offered phone records that showed the woman texting her ex about leaving the baby in the tub to lull her to sleep.The text message read, ""I tried putting the baby asleep in laundry room idk if she will fall asleep tho...i'll let her play in tub with water running with drain open.""The woman said she left a rolled towel under the baby's head to keep it above water while she went into another room to have sex when the man arrived at her apartment. It appears the child was left unsupervised for at least 25 minutes.The man, who was unnamed in reports, said he saw water pooling on the floor and then ran to the bathroom and tried to administer CPR to the unresponsive infant.Clark's 15-month child was also in the home during the incident.After police received an autopsy report, the woman was charged with second-degree murder.""After completing a thorough investigation, waiting for the autopsy and the funeral to occur, the Prescott Valley Police Department arrested Clark,"" a police statement said.Clark was booked into the Yavapai County Detention Facility on September 29.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

Moreover, they use numbers from last year, where Chicago homicides were far lower than they have been in 2016, to make their case.In other words, instead of comparing Indianapolis' 144 murders in 2015 to Chicago's 468, The Daily Beast compares the cities' 2015 murder rates: 16.9 per 100,000 in Indianapolis, 16.7 per 100,000 in Chicago. Again, however, this completely ignores the fact that there have been 564 murders in Chicago so far this year, according to the Chicago Tribune (and it is only October 4).Nevertheless, The Daily Beast contends that Pence ought to be called out for signing a bill that allows concealed carry permit holders to keep guns in their cars in school parking lots for self-defense and also ""for arranging for the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard in carrying concealed weapons.""The Daily Beast is also critical of Pence's actions which ""legalized sawed-off shotguns,"" but they fail to note that his actions simply brought Indiana into line with federal law: that people who wish to own a sawed-off shotgun have to go through an extensive background check-including photographs and fingerprints-and have to pay $200 for a federal tax stamp.While calling for Pence to be grilled on Indiana gun violence, The Daily Beast inexplicably points out that Gary, Indiana used to be ""known as the murder capital of America."" That changed on Pence's watch and even The Daily Beast admits one cause behind the drop in homicides is that ""criminals [in Gary] have joined the exodus for better opportunities elsewhere.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

""We've learned all that.""Clinton also admitted that it was harder to enforce ""multi-national trade deals,"" but didn't mention NAFTA or President Barack Obama's proposed trade Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.Donald Trump frequently cites NAFTA as a bad trade deal for America, citing the jobs from companies like Carrier and Ford to Mexico.""I'm going to tell the head of Carrier: 'I hope you enjoy your stay in Mexico folks, But every single unit that you make and send across our border, which now will be real, you're going to pay a 35 percent tax,'"" Trump said during a rally in Dayton, Ohio in June.Lots of space left at this Ohio University rally as Bill Clinton takes the stage -> pic.twitter.com/jMBvOd4dZH

Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Kaine are set to participate in their sole vice presidential debate of this unpredictable campaign season.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAll eyes will be on the picks of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to inform the citizenry of their plans to deal with the problems facing the country. Many people may wish the tickets of both parties could be flipped, to allow these men to be featured at the top. Regardless, the country is hoping to hear a substantial debate rather than political mudslinging tonight.With a campaign as volatile as this one, no one's holding their breath.Over the course of what has seemed like a very long campaign season, we've heard about Hillary Clinton's supposed body doubles, Donald Trump's nether-regions, and - somehow - Rosie O'Donnell. But during a recent Simulated Convention of States, when leaders from all fifty states traveled to Colonial Williamsburg to identify the biggest problems facing our country, we heard common sense proposals that real Americans care about.In preparation for the vice presidential candidates, here's a list of what they should prioritize in their discussion tonight. Below are the six proposed amendments at the Simulated Convention that would balance the power between the federal government and the states. If enacted, these amendments would signal a turning point in our nation's history by putting Washington in check and restoring liberty back to the individual.Raising the public debt would require two-thirds of each house of Congress, and only for a period not to exceed one year. Neither Congress nor the president could compel or coerce any state to appropriate money.Congress could no longer impose taxes or other exactions on income, gifts, or estates without the approval of three-fifths of the House of Representatives and three-fifths of the Senate, and would separately present the proposal to the president. Five years from the date of its ratification, the 16th Amendment would be repealed.Congress would no longer be able to regulate commerce beyond the sale, shipment, transportation or other movement of goods, articles, or persons. It could not regulate activity solely because it affects commerce among the several states.State legislatures would have the power, by a three-fifths majority, to override any provision of federal law, whether issued by Congress, the president, or any other administrative agency. Any rule, decree, statute, order, regulation, opinion, or decision that has been abrogated through this article cannot be reinstated for a period of six years.In order for an executive action by the president to be overturned, one quarter of the members of Congress or the Senate would submit a written declaration of opposition. Then a vote to adopt the president's proposal would have to take place and win a majority vote. If Congress fails to vote within 180 days, the regulation would be vacated. However, no executive order could go into effect without the approval of Congress. Congresses approval or rejection of a rule or regulation would not be subject to presidential veto.No member of Congress could serve more that six full terms and no Senator could be elected past two full terms. These term limits are retroactive and would include the service prior to the article's enactment.So when you pop the popcorn tonight and tune into the debate, see how many of these issues are discussed. If none are, then you'll know it's time to officially retire your faith in politicians, once and for all.Perhaps this campaign cycle has already driven you to that point. Good! A Convention of States is the only way to effectively limit a federal government that has grown too big to voluntarily restrict itself. It's time for all of the states to join Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Tennessee in taking back the reins from the federal government.Mark Meckler is president of Citizens for Self-Governance SIGN UP

Appeals Court.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe international community closely watches. Most Americans, however, remain unaware of the historic case known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which, according to David Rivkin, one of the attorneys arguing against it, ""is not just to reduce emissions, but to create a new electrical system.""The oral argument phase allows the judges to interact with lawyers from both sides and with each other--typically allowing a maximum 60-90 minutes to hear both sides and occasionally, with an extremely complex case, will allow two hours. However, for the CPP, the court scheduled a morning session focusing on the EPA's authority and an afternoon session on the constitutional claims against the rule--which ended up totaling nearly 7 hours. Jeff Holmstead, a partner with Bracewell Law, representing one of the lead challengers, told me this was the only time the full court has sat all day to hear a case.One of the issues addressed was whether the EPA could ""exercise major transformative power without a clear statement from Congress on the issue""--with the 2014 Utility Air Regulatory Group (UARG) v. EPA determining it could not. Republican appointee Judge Brett Kavanaugh noted that the UARG scenario ""sounds exactly like this one.""Judge Thomas Griffith, a Bush appointee, questioned: ""Why isn't this debate going on in the floor of the Senate?"" In a post-oral argument press conference, Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) pointed out that the debate has been held on the Senate floor in the form of cap-and-trade legislation--which has failed repeatedly. Therefore, he said, the Obama administration has tried to do through regulation what the Senate wouldn't do through legislation.""Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, one of Obama's mentors,"" writes the Dallas Morning News: ""made a star appearance to argue that the Clean Power Plan is unconstitutional.""Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, a Bush appointee, concluded: ""You have given us all we need and more, perhaps, to work on it.""The day in court featured many of the nation's best oral advocates and both sides feel good about how the case was presented.For the challengers (who call CPP ""an unlawful power grab""), West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who along with Texas AG Ken Paxton, co-lead the case, reported: ""We said (then) that we were looking forward to having our day in court on the merits. Today was that day. I think that the collective coalition was able to put very strong legal arguments forward, as to why this regulation is unlawful, and why it should be set aside.""But the case has its proponents, too, and they, also, left feeling optimistic. In a blog post for the Environmental Defense Fund, Martha Roberts wrote about what she observed in the courtroom: ""The judges today were prepared and engaged. They asked sharply probing questions of all sides. But the big news is that a majority of judges appeared receptive to arguments in support of the Clean Power Plan."" She concluded that she's confident ""that climate protection can win the day.""The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) summarized the session saying that stakeholders on all sides were left ""parsing questions and reactions, and searching for signs of which way the judges are leaning."" U.S. News reported: ""The judges repeatedly interrupted the lawyers for both sides to ask pointed questions about the legal underpinnings of their positions.""The decision, which is not expected for several months, may come down to the ideological make-up of the court: 6 of the judges were appointed by Democrat presidents and 4 by Republicans. Though, according to WSJ, Obama appointee Judge Patricia Millet ""expressed concern that the administration was in effect requiring power plants to subsidize companies competing with them for electricity demand."" She offered hope to the challengers when she said: ""That seems to be quite different from traditional regulation."" Additionally, in his opinion published in the Washington Post, Constitutional law professor Jonathan Adler, stated: ""Some of the early reports indicate that several Democratic nominees posed tough questions to the attorney defending the EPA.""Now, the judges will deliberate and discuss. Whatever decision they come to, experts agree that the losing side will appeal and that the case will end up in front of the Supreme Court--most likely in the 2017/2018 session with a decision possible as late as June 2018. There, the ultimate result really rests in the presidential election, as the current SCOTUS make up will be changed with the addition of the ninth Justice, who will be appointed by the November 8 winner--and that Justice will reflect the new president's ideology.Hillary Clinton has promised to continue Obama's climate change policies while Donald Trump has announced he'll rescind the CPP and cancel the Paris Climate Agreement.The CPP is about more than the higher electricity costs and decreased grid reliability, which results from heavy reliance on wind and solar energy as CPP requires, and, as the South Australian experiment proves, doesn't work. It has far-reaching impacts. WSJ states: ""Even a partial rebuke of the Clean Power Plan could make it impossible for the U.S. to hit the goals Mr. Obama pledged in the Paris climate deal.""

They do not realize that they are suffering the consequences of global capitalism. And so you have the capitalists like Donald Trump who represent themselves as the savior.Person in crowd: Fuck Donald Trump!DAVIS: Yeah, we can do that. But we also have to figure out how to prevent Donald Trump from being elected next month. Now, as a person who has been involved in radical politics all of my life, I have never seen the electoral arena as a place where I can express my radical, revolutionary politics. And it's kind of hard to imagine being revolutionary within the context of the existing electoral system. Am I right?(Crowd cheers)DAVIS: So I think we need a new party.I think we have to start imagining and building a political party that is not linked to the capitalist corporations. A party that is feminist, a party that is anti-racist, a party that is opposed to the occupation of Palestine by the state of Israel, a party that will represent the true needs of the people, not only of this country but the people of the world.And I could also talk about a party that stands for food sovereignty, a party that recognizes that when capitalist corporations are involved in the production of food, that human beings need to nourish themselves, they're involved for the purpose of generating as much profit as possible. And therefore they destroy the earth, they create untold pain for the animals that they raise in order to provide food for human beings. And so I want a radically different kind of political party. But unfortunately, it's not gonna be possible to build that party between now and election day. So, as much as I would argue that the electoral arena is not a space where we can exercise our radical politics, I will not tell you not to vote. We all have to exercise the the right to vote. We have struggled too long and too hard to give up that right today.Person in crowd: Vote Gary Johnson! (Crowd cheers)DAVIS: I don't know about that.So I want to ask you to think about the best reason for going to the polls next month. The best reason in my opinion is to create the space that will allow us to begin to build our movement, to create flourishing movements and to build that political party that I was talking about a moment ago. And you know what will happen if Donald Trump is elected. You know about the consequences for generations to come. The fact alone that it would be possible to stack the Supreme Court in a way that will reverse so many of the gains for which we struggled over decades, and over generations. So, what does that mean?Person in crowd: Vote Stein!DAVIS: What does that mean? You know if you go to the polls and you- if you have- I have problems with the other candidates. I have problems with Hillary Clinton, I'm sorry. Because I have problems with the Democratic Party that is just as linked to the corporate capitalist structure as the Republican party. But I know that if I vote for Donald Trump, or if I don't vote for anyone, that I will perhaps be contributing to the possibility of increasing oppression over the next decade.And let me tell you I know what oppression is all about. Early in my career as a political activist I was charged with murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy, and faced the death penalty 3 times. And it was only because of the development of a mass movement all over the world, that my life was saved, and that I can be with you this afternoon, reflecting on the possibilities of building a movement that is building a movement to safe-guard our future.And so, let me say that we can not take where we are for granted, it is wonderful that young people are rising up, not only all over this country, but lets remember our movements are connected with what is going on in Brazil, with what is going on in Columbia, with what is happening in Palestine, with what is going on at this very moment in South Africa, because they are struggling again to be able to imagine a future that is a future of freedom. And so let me conclude by saying that there is one river that we have to cross next month. And let's cross that river so that we will be able to begin the process of building a movement that will transform - in a revolutionary manner - the entire society of a United States of America. Thank you very much.Davis' background is much more complex than she lets on in her talk.Davis was a college professor and radical communist. In the 1960s, Angela Davis led events to support the ""Free The Soledad Brothers"" movement. The Soledad brothers are a group of prisoners that included a convicted thug named George Jackson.Another one of George Jackson's biggest supporters was his 17-year-old brother Jonathan Jackson, who was frequently seen at Angela Davis's side during protests to support George Jackson.On August 7, 1970 that devotion turned deadly when Jonathan Jackson entered a Marin County, California courthouse armed with a pistol, an M1 rifle, and a sawed off shotgun -- all weapons that were owned by and registered to Angela Davis.After sitting in a court room for a few minutes, Johnathan Jackson threw a pistol to the Black Panther member who was on trial that day. The two were soon joined by two other prisoners and began taking hostages. A district attorney and three female jurors were tied up with piano wire, while the presiding judge in the courtroom that day -- Judge Haley -- had the sawed-off shotgun taped to his neck.Johnathan Jackson and the three other Black Panther marauders demanded that George Jackson be released by noon that day, even though George Jackson was on trial for killing a prison guard.But Jonathan Jackson's plan went horribly wrong when a police shootout occurred, killing four people and wounding two, including the prosecutor who was paralyzed for life. Jonathan Jackson was killed, and Judge Haley had his head blown off by Angela Davis's shotgun.Jonathan Jackson became a martyr and a hero, and hundreds of people attended his funeral singing his praises.Angela Davis went on the run, and the call went out to free Angela Davis and all political prisoners. The only Black Panther to survive, Ruchell Magee, well, the left wanted to freed him, too.After a nationwide manhunt, Angela Davis was captured by law enforcement.While Angela Davis was awaiting trial in 1971, George Jackson would be killed in a hail of gunfire as he attempted to escape prison.Still awaiting trial, Angela Davis wrote a eulogy for George Jackson and vowed to continue fighting for him. She spoke about her love for the man she had declared her comrade and lifelong husband. Davis said in her eulogy: ""I will try my best to express that love in the way he would have wanted -- by reaffirming my determination to fight for the cause George died defending.""Angela Davis went to trial and was found not guilty of all charges against her, despite testimony that she had bought guns with Jonathan Jackson just days before the Marin County Courthouse massacre.The legend of George Jackson and Angela Davis lives on today in the Black Lives Matter movement. Angela Davis has carried on the cause by promoting an end to ""mass incarceration,"" which is one of the Black Lives Matter movement's key demands.DAVIS: Numbers of people in this country, largely white people, who do not recognize their pain, and their suffering is linked to the pain and to the suffering of black people, latinos, native Americans. They do not realize that they are suffering the consequences of global capitalism. And so you have the capitalists like Donald Trump who represent themselves as the savior.
Person in crowd: Fuck Donald Trump!

""His Nissan Maxima got stuck on a berm and his catalytic converter and muffler ignited dead grass,"" sparking the blaze:The fire swiftly spread and burned 29,322 acres in Kern and Tulare counties, according to Acting U.S. Atty. Phillip A. Talbert. Flames destroyed six homes and triggered mandatory evacuations of several communities in both counties...Ranchers spotted Garcia-Avalos carrying his 4-year-old son on his shoulders west of the Cedar Creek Campground area, where the fire had been reported, according to a U.S. District Court complaint. They suspected he started the fire and offered to help, but he said he was OK. Still, ranchers recorded the conversation with an iPhone.Garcia-Avalos told the ranchers that his car had been stolen and that his son saw the man who took it, and that he was walking home to Delano, which is more than 42 miles away from the Cedar Creek area, according to an affidavit written by U.S. Forest Service Special Agent Brian Adams.The ranchers were able to convince Garcia-Avalos to enter their home so that he could call someone for help. During the visit, they asked him several questions about the fire, and Garcia-Avalos denied responsibility, prosecutors say.At the crash site, fire investigators found a burned vehicle and shoe prints belonging to a small child and an adult. The shoe prints led investigators from the car to Highway 155.Garcia-Avalos was sentenced to seven months in prison for lying to U.S. Forest Service law enforcement officers and six months for starting the Cedar Fire. After serving his 13-month sentence, he will be deported back to Mexico, when he'll start paying back $61 million in damages--at the low cost of only $25 per month, or $300 each year. (At that rate, it would take Garcia-Avalos some 203,333 years to pay the total cost of the damages.)Sequoia National Forest, founded as a national park in 1890, holds the ""greatest concentration of giant sequoia groves in the world,"" according to the U.S. Forest Service. The giant sequoia is the single species in its genus and grows naturally in only one area of the world, the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. These magnificent trees are the oldest and largest living things on Earth.Conservative author Ann Coulter documents the sickening destruction of national parks and forests at the hands of illegal aliens setting up drug farms or attacking law enforcement as they break into the country. ""Despite the evidence adduced by the GAO showing that illegal immigrants are both the single largest cause of wildfires and also the biggest impediment to extinguishing them, the government report dared not suggest building a fence,"" she writes. ""Instead, our government decided that 100 percent of the price of illegal aliens' fire setting should be paid by Americans.""Illegal aliens have little respect for the American tradition of preserving natural wonders and biodiversity, Coulter writes in Adios, America:The environmental damage done to federal parkland by the Mexican pot growers is breathtaking. According to USA Today, the illegals ""scar the landscape by crudely terracing hillsides that erode under winter rain. They spill pesticides, fertilizer and diesel fuel used to power generators that run extensive drip-irrigation systems. They dam creeks for water sources, plant salsa gardens, disfigure trees and leave behind tons of garbage, human waste and litter."" Park officers find deer carcasses hanging from trees, owls impaled on posts, and claws from grisly bears displayed as trophies. Except for one fully brainwashed government official, who said, ""I don't want to single out one group,"" there was no mistaking who was dumping pesticides, chopping down trees, and threatening hikers in our parks...The Mexican assault on America's national parks goes well beyond what is absolutely necessary to cultivate marijuana crops. Reporters who have visited the sites gape in horror at the trash illegal aliens have left behind. Amid the plethora of two (2) New York Times stories on the pot farms, one said that law enforcement officers have found ""elaborate tree-houses, makeshift showers and, invariably, trash and pesticides, much of which ends up in streams and creeks."" The Fresno Bee reported that the illegal immigrants leave behind ""tons of trash"" in addition to poaching deer and other park animals. The Los Angeles Times said of one camp: ""Trash was strewn everywhere-- empty cans, torn packets of noodles, a crusty leather rifle scabbard. A soggy sleeping bag was stuffed behind a tree."" The chief law enforcement officer at Sequoia National Park swept his hand toward the piles of trash, saying, ""Nice, eh? Welcome to your national park.""Garcia-Avalos also holds a criminal record including burglary and car theft charges. American taxpayers will foot the bill for the court costs and to shelter and feed Garcia-Avalos during his sentence, and will likely eat the cost of the forest fire as well.The fire swiftly spread and burned 29,322 acres in Kern and Tulare counties, according to Acting U.S. Atty.

Moore said his order clarified that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges - which struck down laws banning same-sex marriage in Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee - did not automatically indicate the same for Alabama.Moore wrote:Many probate judges are issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in accordance with Obergefell; others are issuing marriage licenses only to couples of the opposite gender or have ceased issuing all marriage licenses. Until further decision by the Alabama Supreme Court, the existing orders of the Alabama Supreme Court that Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment or the Alabama Marriage Protection Act remain in full force and effect.In April of 2015, the Coalition of African American Pastors (CAAP) awarded Moore the ""Letter from Birmingham Jail Courage"" Award for maintaining his stand on marriage between one man and one woman.""Justice Moore is an example for all of us,"" said CAAP president Rev. William Owens. ""By making a principled and persuasive stand for marriage, Justice Moore has singled himself out as someone who is ready to defend our most cherished values and help lead this new civil rights movement.""""By his words and action, he has helped preserve marriage, the family, justice, and the spirit of democracy,"" Owens added.Owens and his coalition had been highly critical of attempts by both President Obama and former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to portray the same-sex marriage movement as another civil rights campaign.In February of 2015, Moore sent Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley a letter, in which he referred to federal court rulings on same-sex marriage as ""judicial tyranny."" He added that the Constitution does not give the federal government the power to ""redefine marriage.""In 2003, UPI reported Moore was removed as chief justice for defying a federal court order banning a large Ten Commandments monument outside the state Supreme Court building.""Justice Moore is intoxicated by his own sense of self-righteousness,"" said far-left Southern Poverty Law Center president Richard Cohen. ""He doesn't seem to understand that we're a nation of laws, not of men.""Though Moore - whose term ends in 2019 - will be unable to run again due to age restrictions, AL.com is suggesting that the suspension may likely be a political win for him for a potential gubernatorial bid.According to AL.com:Moore, the now suspended Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, was served the penalty by the court for what it described as his defiance in ordering probate judges not to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples even after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage.By being suspended, Moore can say that he stuck to his convictions - a quality that appeals to voters in a political climate that favors authenticity over establishment politicians. And by being once again thrust into the national spotlight, Moore's already sky-high name recognition will only grow.""This could be the beginning of the gubernatorial 2018 race,"" said political science professor Natalie Davis of Birmingham-Southern College. ""If you're looking for the elected official or political figure in the state who has the most favorable ratings, it's Roy Moore. So he starts off even with this hanging over him in a pretty good position if he seeks the governorship.""A poll commissioned by the Alabama Forestry Association and conducted in July found that Moore was most favored of 10 possible candidates for governor by 600 likely GOP primary voters. He received 28.2 percent of support, while Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange received18.6 percent. The remainder of the candidates trailed substantially, and more than 23 percent of those surveyed were undecided.""He has, in politics what we like to call universal 'name ID,'"" said the Forestry Association's director of political affairs Bill Harris. ""He has good favorable, and high negatives. I think with Judge Moore, you either like him or you don't like him.""Many probate judges are issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in accordance with Obergefell; others are issuing marriage licenses only to couples of the opposite gender or have ceased issuing all marriage licenses.

In the ensuing year, she has stood by that proposed policy, one that her Republican rival for the Presidency, Donald Trump, vigorously opposes.More than 45 percent of the refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2016, 38,556 out of 84,995, were Muslim, according to the Department of State's interactive website. Of the 12,587 Syrian refugees who were resettled in the United States in FY 2016, more than 99 percent, 12,487, were Muslim.""The Democrats have rejected patriotic assimilation in favor of aggressive multi-culturalism masquerading as 'integration,'"" John Fonte wrote recently at National Review.Hillary Clinton has made it clear that she supports and will expand President Obama's immigration policies. These policies are by now well known: executive amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants (and eventual citizenship); the end (for practical purposes) of border-visa enforcement; large increases in low-skilled immigration (through ""comprehensive immigration reform""); and increased numbers of un-vetted Syrian refugees and young Central American immigrants.Though Clinton has publicly called for increasing the number of Syrian refugees allowed to enter the United States from the 12,587 who entered in FY 2016, she has not specifically commented publicly on President Obama's proposal to increase the total number of refugees coming in to the United States in FY 2017 from 85,000 to 110,000 per year.Corcoran, who founded the Refugee Resettlement Watch blog in 2007, says:If Clinton is elected, she will certainly bring in at least 200,000 refugees in her first year, the majority of whom will be from Muslim dominated countries. She is on record as supporting an increase in the number of Syrian refugees allowed in to the United States from the 10,000 targeted by the Obama administration in FY 2016 to 65,000 per year. In addition to these 65,000 Syrian refugees, another 135,000, perhaps more are likely to come in to the U.S. under Clinton in FY 2017.Don Barnett, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, agrees with Corcoran's assessment.""I suspect Hillary Clinton will join liberal congressmen who are demanding that 200,000 refugees be resettled to the U.S. annually,"" he tells Breitbart News.
""Secretary Clinton won't make a public statement about the number of refugees she plans to bring in to the United States in FY 2017 because if she told the truth about her plans to bring in 200,000 to 250,000 refugees in FY 2017 if elected, she would almost certainly lose the election,"" Refugee Resettlement Watch's Corcoran adds.""I actually think the number could be higher than 200,000 annually because the Refugee Act of 1980 allows the President to go back to the well for ""emergency"" numbers over and above the annual determination,"" an attorney familiar with the refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News:I think there is extremely high incentive for the resettlement agencies to go along with any number (and they have pushed for even higher numbers in FY17 than what Obama asked for) because it is more money in their pockets.  It's important to remember that this is an industry first and foremost meaning that the more taxpayer money that flows to the local affiliates, the more they can expand their operations and staffs. It is equally important to remember that the refugee component is only a small part of the other categories of humanitarian entrants that taken together are a very very high number of individuals.Corcoran also says:Hilllary Clinton is clearly hiding her real plans from the American people. If she wins the election, she will claim a mandate on this issue where the majority of Americans oppose her plans, and will not only flood the country with refugees from countries that hate us, she will never build a border wall and with the help of a weak Congress, grant citizenship to the more than 11 million illegal aliens already in the country.""Voters strongly oppose President Obama's plan to bring 110,000 Middle Eastern and African refugees to this country next year, up from 85,000 this year, and view that decision as an increased danger to U.S. national security,"" a recent Rasmussen poll concluded:Seventy-four percent of likely voters oppose increasing the number of refugees from 85,000 in FY 2016 to the 110,000 President Obama has proposed for FY 2017. Only 18 percent of likely voters approve of the proposed increase, or think it is too little.Barnett of CIS offers one reason for Clinton's reticence to be up front about her plans to bring in refugees.""The Clintons have experience with refugees and politics. Bill Clinton's only electoral loss was the Arkansas gubernatorial election of 1980, which may have been affected by the placement of Mariel boatlift refugees in Arkansas,"" he notes.""If elected, Hillary Clinton will likely bring in at least 200,000 refugees in FY 2018, as well, though she's not publicly stating that,"" Barnett tells Breitbart News.Breitbart News asked the Clinton campaign four specific questions about her refugee resettlement policies if elected, but has not yet received a response:1. Does Secretary Clinton support President' Obama's proposal to bring 110,000 refugees into the U.S. in FY 2017 under the federal refugee resettlement program?2. Secretary Clinton has already proposed increasing the number of Syrian refugees allowed to enter the U.S. annually to 65,000. Under President Obama's proposed ceiling of 110,000 refugees for FY 2017, this would reduce the number of refugees from countries other than Syria to 55,000. In FY 2016, 72,500 refugees entered the U.S. from countries other than Syria, while 12,500 entered from Syria.If elected President, would Secretary Clinton use the executive authority of the office of the President to increase the number of refugees entering the U.S. in FY 2017 beyond the 110,000 proposed by the Obama administration so as to not reduce the number of refugees coming from countries other than Syria?3. If elected President, what number of refugees would President Clinton allow entry in the U.S. in FY 2017?4. The Refugee Council USA has proposed increasing the number of refugees coming to the U.S. through the traditional refugee resettlement program in FY 2017 to 140,000, while allowing 60,000 refugees to enter the country through non-traditional but legal means, for a total of 200,000 refugees in FY 2017. If elected President, would Secretary Clinton implement the Refugee Council USA's proposals and allow 200,000 refugees to enter the U.S. in FY 2017?The Obama administration and the resettlement agencies, non-profit ""voluntary agencies"" (VOLAGs), that receive more than $1 billion annually from the federal government brought refugees into the country during September, the last month of FY 2016, at a run rate that would bring in well over 110,000 refugees on an annualized basis. There is little indication they intend to slow that pace during the ten weeks funded in this interim budget.In fact, there is every indication that the Obama administration, with the ideological support of the Hillary Clinton campaign team, along with their allies in the politically powerful refugee resettlement industry, continue to aggressively increase both the number of refugees they are bringing in to the United States and the number of locations where those refugees are being resettled.Many former Clinton and Obama administration refugee officials are now executives with the ""non-profits"" who form Refugee Council USA ,the lobbying arm of the refugee resettlement industry. Its members include the nine largest VOLAGs (Church World Service, Episcopal Migration Ministries, Ethiopian Community Development Council, HIAS (formerly Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), International Rescue Committee, Lutheran Immigration And Refugee Service, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops/Migration & Refugee Services, U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, World Relief), as well as more than a dozen related organizations.Both Refugee Council USA and InterAction, an organization of U.S. based international non-profits, told Congress in a statement this August they want 200,000 refugees resettled in the U.S. in FY 2017.Lavinia Limon , who currently heads up the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI), one of the top nine VOLAGs as well as a huge recipient of federal funds, is a champion of the ""aggressive multi-culturalism"" Clinton/Obama policy that rejects traditional American assimilation policy. She began implementation of that ""aggressive multi-culturalism"" policy immediately after being named ORR director in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, as Breitbart reported previously:[S]ince 1975, she's been using the government-supplied flood of unskilled and culturally distant migrants to convert Americans' neighborhoods into ""new American communities."" Most of the targeted neighborhoods are in politically weak towns far from wealthy districts, who are protected from migrant inflows by influential politicians.Limon is part of a circle of Democratic progressive politicians who believe Americans' government should not favor Americans over foreigners, and that all humans -- Americans and Afghans, Christians and Muslims, skilled and unskilled, healthy and diseased -- should be welcomed in the United States. She is allied with various business groups -- plus their GOP supporters -- who use each annual inflow of migrant workers as replacements for prior years' migrants, many of whom flee to better and safer jobs.She was named director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) by President Bill Clinton in 1993, where she worked for Donna Shalala, who was Secretary of Health and Human Services. These days, Shalala is the current president of the Clinton Foundation.Before she left ORR in 2001, Limon funded a 48-page report that published in 2004 by the Migration Policy Institute. That report, titled, ""Building the New American Community: Newcomer Integration and Inclusion Experiences in Non-Traditional Gateway Cities."" is the how-to plan used by migration activists to transform small cities into refugee homes by partnering with local institutions, such as the Chamber of Commerce and community/technical colleges.Secretary Clinton's defenders in the mainstream media have used her failure to publicly specify the number of refugees she will bring in the United States in FY 2017 that reasonable estimates of her plans made by her opponents are ""false.""On September 20 in High Point, North Carolina, GOP nominee Donald Trump, citing a Senate study, said: ""Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term, alone, with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.""Politifact says that ""Clinton has not said she would bring anywhere near that number; that's an extrapolation put together by the Trump campaign,"" even though it acknowledged, ""We asked Clinton's campaign how many refugees her administration would admit in the future and how much it would cost, but a spokesman said they had no new details.""But the 620,000 estimate does not come from the Trump campaign. Instead, it comes from a statement released by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest chaired by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL):Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has announced her desire to admit at least 65,000 refugees from Syria - on top of the existing refugee flow already entering the United States. What Clinton has not explained, however, is that in addition to the clear national security implications related to accepting more refugees, there are massive financial costs that would be borne by federal, state, and local governments.Assuming Clinton's desire to bring in 65,000 Syrian refugees is in addition to the Obama Administration's current goal of admitting 10,000 this fiscal year (out of 85,000 total refugees), that would amount to an increase of 55,000 refugees. 55,000 on top of 85,000 totals 140,000 refugees. The Obama Administration's target for FY 2017 is actually 100,000 refugees, meaning that adding 55,000 refugees to that would result in 155,000 refugees each year.  Due to statutory flaws in our Refugee Admissions Program, the number could be as high as Hillary Clinton desires. Assuming her goal is to admit 155,000 refugees each year during a hypothetical first term in office, a Clinton Administration would admit at least 620,000 refugees in just four years - a population roughly the size of Baltimore.Submit testimony to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, which is holding hearings on the issue this week, here.Refugee Resettlement Watch's Corcoran recently asked rhetorically, ""Will refugee flood gates open even wider if Hillary elected on November 8th?""""Yes, I believe they will,"" she wrote, noting that the Refugee Act of 1980 has an emergency provision Clinton is likely to exercise:There is a very clear provision, which I don't think has been used (the large crush of Vietnamese came before the Refugee Act of 1980 became law), but I think Hillary will use it. By defeating Donald Trump, she will feel she has a mandate to open our borders. There definitely won't be a border fence built and I predict she will use every lawful means available to admit as many migrants as she can, including the emergency provisions of the Refugee Act of 1980.Could she add her 65,000 Syrians to the 110,000 refugees Obama proposed for FY2017, or could she go even higher? Yes, she could knowing that the Congress, even if Republicans still hold the majority, is weak and will be further demoralized by her win. . .Hillary could easily bump our numbers up to a quarter of a million! (That would be in addition to the masses of asylum seekers---phony refugees--now streaming across our southern border.)This past fall, the State Department Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, Anne C. Richard, a former executive with the International Rescue Committee, a leading VOLAG, who was appointed to her current position by then-Secretary of State Clinton in 2012,  said that with their FY 2016 appropriation authorizing 85,000 resettled refugees, they could resettle 100,000 refugees if called on.""We have evidence that Hillary Clinton's old friends at the Department of State have readied nearly 50 new resettlement sites in 49 states which would only be necessary if they were planning for a massive increase in refugee numbers beginning on Clinton's inauguration day,"" Refugee Resettlement Watch's Corcoran tells Breitbart News. Hillary Clinton has made it clear that she supports and will expand President Obama's immigration policies. These policies are by now well known: executive amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants (and eventual citizenship); the end (for practical purposes) of border-visa enforcement; large increases in low-skilled immigration (through ""comprehensive immigration reform""); and increased numbers of un-vetted Syrian refugees and young Central American immigrants.If Clinton is elected, she will certainly bring in at least 200,000 refugees in her first year, the majority of whom will be from Muslim dominated countries.

State television said insurgent shelling killed five people in government-held areas of the city on Tuesday.The army offensive is backed by an air campaign by President Bashar al-Assad's government and its allies that has hit hospitals, destroyed infrastructure and caused hundreds of civilian casualties.Another rebel commander from the Nour al-Din al-Zinki group said the army opened several fronts simultaneously to stretch the rebel forces, and dropped leaflets from helicopters calling on them to surrender.After securing the strategic Handarat camp in the northern edge of the city last Thursday following what rebels described as carpet bombing, the army pressed on south of the camp.It took the ruins of the former Kindi hospital, from where soldiers could control the Jandoul traffic circle, a major road intersection. ""They leveled the ground and our people had no choice but to retreat under the bombing of the Russians,"" the Zinki commander said.Rebels say Kurdish YPG militia controlling the strategic Sheikh Maqsoud district in north Aleppo city have also taken advantage of the army gains to move toward the Shuqayyif industrial area that lies between Handarat and their enclave.That would allow the army and its allied militias to move deeper into rebel-held northern districts of the city, although rebels expect the army thrust will slow in residential areas that offer them more cover from air raids.""The battles inside the city's districts as the regime applies more pressure will be difficult as these areas are better defended and will allow the rebels to hold out,"" said Halabi.In the heart of the city, war planes believed to be Russian and flying at high altitude hit Bustan al Qasr, Hay al Huluk and Fardous neighborhoods with reports of casualties, several rebel contacts said.In the Aleppo countryside, Russian and Syrian war planes dropped incendiary bombs on the towns of Darat Izza and al-Zirba.Separately, rebels fighting Islamic State militants said they killed at least 30 militants after a failed attempt to gain ground in Eastern Qalamoun area, north of Damascus, where fighting has escalated in recent weeks.SIGN UP"

""Some of that expectation is partly answered but you have to understand that if we're going to make a major publication in relation to the United States at a particular hour, we don't do it at 3 AM.""""We have a great many upcoming publications,"" Assange promised, noting that ""Our sources have suffered terrible consequences in the United States."" Assange has implied that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was a Wikileaks source.Assange said that Wikileaks will be publishing once a week for the next ten weeks with a special interest in the ""U.S. election"" and topics like war, surveillance, and Google.""There's been a lot of misquoting of me,"" Assange said when asked if his upcoming publications would destroy Hillary Clinton.""In this particular case, the misquoting has to do with, we want to harm Hillary Clinton, or I want to harm Hillary Clinton."" Assange said that some in the United States want to ""personalize"" his upcoming publications.Expectant watchers filled the comments on Right Side Broadcasting's Youtube livestream of the event with taunts of ""Boring,"" ""ZZZZZZ,"" and ""Assange is a no show."" One commenter compared the event to Geraldo Rivera's ill-fated entry into Al Capone's secret vault, where Rivera found nothing interesting inside.The press conference convened at 4:06 AM Eastern Time in Berlin from a dimly lit auditorium with a rudimentary projection screen.A woman representing Wikileaks introduced a video montage commemorating the organization's biggest hits over its ten-year run, including its publication of documents and videos pertaining to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- some of which were leaked to the group by Bradley Manning -- and the operating procedures at Guantanamo Bay prison. The woman extensively recapped some of Wikileaks' most divisive cases, claiming that the group has endured dDos cyber attacks and ""propaganda attacks"" from enemy forces.The woman, referencing the Democratic National Committee email leak that complicated the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, said that Wikileaks is now getting hit with another major propaganda attack. The woman outright denied that anyone at Wikileaks is a ""Russian spy,"" citing thousands of documents that Wikileaks has published ""exposing"" the regime of Bashar al Assad, a Russian ally.""For us, these kinds of attacks are quite interesting,"" she said. ""The lesson we've learned through these propaganda attacks is just to keep publishing ... And so we will keep publishing.""A small panel ensued, with Wikileaks officials talking about their biggest cases.Wikileaks then showed a video collecting Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and C-SPAN segments in which U.S. politicos, mostly Republicans like Mitch McConnell and Karl Rove, called for Assange's arrest and prosecution. One of Assange's attorneys spoke about Assange's ""indefinite detention"" at the Ecuadorian embassy. The lawyer made reference to the ""smear campaign caused by the DNC leaks"" and to Hillary Clinton's desire, stated in a private meeting, to drone Assange.SIGN UP"

This follows a US announcement that it is suspending its peace efforts with Russia regarding the Syrian conflict.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Syrian government continued to strike besieged, rebel-held parts of eastern Aleppo, hitting the area's largest hospital, according to activists. A monitoring group said more than 400 civilians have been killed in and around Aleppo since the collapse of a US and Russian-brokered cease-fire two weeks ago, mainly in the rebel-held east.In central Syria, meanwhile, two suicide bombers struck the city of Hama close to an office of President Bashar Assad's Baath party, killing three people and wounding at least 11, state news agency SANA said. ISIS claimed responsibility in an online statement.SANA said a suicide bomber detonated his explosives-packed belt in Hama's al-Assi Square, and another suicide bomber struck 15 minutes later. One of SANA's photographers, Ibrahim Ajaj, was wounded as he was covering the explosions, the agency said, adding that he is in stable condition.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the two explosions killed three people and wounded 14.Suicide attacks in government-held areas are not uncommon, but blasts in the city of Hama, which is firmly under the control of Assad's forces, have been rare. The twin bombings came as various insurgent groups have been on the offensive north of the city.Another suicide bombing struck a Kurdish wedding outside the northeastern Syrian city of Hassakeh, killing at least 22 people, according to the Observatory, which said the toll was likely to rise. The Kurdish Hawar news agency confirmed the attack but did not provide a toll. The state new agency SANA said 20 were killed and 55 were wounded in the wedding. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.The death toll among the Syrian rebels near the Turkish border is the highest since Turkey sent troops and tanks into Syria in August to help rebels recapture ISIS strongholds in the area and curb the advance of a Syrian Kurdish militia, which Ankara views as an extension of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish separatists.Turkish military officials said 15 Syrian opposition fighters were killed and about 35 wounded in their offensive, which seeks to capture seven residential districts south of the town of al-Rai. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.The Observatory, which relies on a network of activists across Syria, said 21 rebels were killed and more than two dozen wounded, adding that many of the casualties were due to land mines and booby-traps planted by the extremists.The Observatory said the Turkey-backed rebels are trying to reach the town of Dabiq, which occupies a central place in IS propaganda.The extremists, citing ancient prophecy, believe Dabiq will be the scene of an apocalyptic battle between Christianity and Islam. The group named its online magazine after the town, which it has occupied since August 2014.The Observatory said ISIS has been preparing for the battle in Dabiq for weeks, planting mines and explosives and sending some of its most experienced fighters to defend the town.The epicenter of the civil war remains in Aleppo, however, where Syrian and Russian warplanes have been pounding rebel-held areas since the breakdown of the cease-fire on Sept. 19.The Observatory said Russian and Syrian warplanes, and government artillery, have killed at least 387 civilians in rebel-held Aleppo and its rural surroundings, including 72 children and 24 women, since the truce broke down. In the rebel-held part of the city alone, 294 were killed. The group recorded 19 civilians killed in government-held Aleppo.In the offensive, which includes a limited ground operation, health facilities have repeatedly come under attack.On Monday, Adham Sahloul of the US-based Syrian American Medical Society, which supports various hospitals in rebel-held areas, said a bunker-busting bomb gouged out a 10-meter-deep crater where it landed near the entrance of one of the largest emergency hospitals in the rebel-held part of Aleppo. This is the third time the hospital has hit in a week, including once with several bombs. This time, the attack rendered it ""not salvageable,"" said Sahloul.Sahloul said at least three maintenance staff were killed, including one found 100 meters (330 feet) away, apparently thrown by the impact of the explosion.The workers were carrying out repair work at the hospital following last week's attacks. Rescue workers are still searching for people under the rubble, and there were fears the building would collapse, Sahloul said. He added that since 2014 most of the hospital's facilities were set up underground to protect it.The Observatory confirmed the bombing, but put the death toll at six.In the central Hama province, a medical relief group and the Observatory said airstrikes have damaged and put one of Syria's most secure hospitals, which had been dug into a mountain, out of service.The International Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, or UOSSM, said the Dr. Hasan Al-Araj Hospital--also known as ""Cave Hospital""--was struck twice on Sunday.The Observatory said Russian warplanes carried out the attacks that hit the hospital, adding that it's one of the largest hospitals in rebel-held parts of the country. UOSSM said there were minor injuries from the attack.Dr. Abdallah Darwish, the hospital's director and health care chief in Hama province, was quoted in the UOSSM statement as saying that the hospital was likely struck by ""bunker-buster"" missiles as it was ""well-fortified in a cave and impervious to previous attacks.""The bomb completely destroyed the hospital's emergency ward and caused major damage throughout the facility, he said.""These vicious and atrocious campaigns are literally choking the life out of civilians, they are deplorable and unacceptable,"" said Dr. Khaula Sawah, CEO of UOSSM USA.SIGN UP"

But both underscored deep mistrust and rising tensions between the former Cold War foes, who are increasingly at odds on a number of issues, particularly Syria and Ukraine. In the short term, the end of discussions on Syria deals a potential death blow to efforts to slow the civil war and begin negotiations on possible elections in the country that could mean the ouster of President Bashar Assad.Underscoring the deterioration between the US and Russia, Putin suspended a deal on plutonium disposal hours before the US announcement. The two powers will still continue discussions on the Iran nuclear deal, Ukraine and other non-Syria issues.The Russian Foreign Ministry said the US has ""done all it could to destroy the atmosphere encouraging cooperation."" It cited US sanctions on Moscow over its annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine and NATO's deployment of forces near Russian borders.U.S. officials said that despite the suspension of talks with Russia, they would continue to work for a truce and aid deliveries to Syria in other gatherings, including the International Syria Support Group, a collection of nations, including Russia.The Obama administration said it decided to cut off discussions on Syria because Russia had not lived up to the terms of last month's agreement to restore a tattered cease-fire and ensure sustained deliveries of humanitarian aid to besieged cities, such as Aleppo, which has been under bombardment from Russian and Syrian forces.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, ""What's clear is that there is nothing more for the United States and Russia to talk about with regard to trying to reach an agreement that would reduce the violence inside of Syria and that's tragic.""""This is not a decision that was taken lightly,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments ... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed.""Kirby's statement said that Russia and Syria are pursuing military action in violation of the cease-fire agreement, and pointed to their targeting of hospitals as well as the Sept. 19 airstrike on a United Nations humanitarian aid convoy. The US accused Russia of bombing that convoy, a charge both Russia and Syria have denied.Russia intervened on behalf of its close ally Syria on Sept. 30 last year, joining Assad's bombardment of both anti-Assad rebel groups and militant groups such as the Islamic State and Fatah al-Sham Front, an al-Qaida spinoff formerly known as the Nusra Front. Russia is interested in propping up Assad in part because Russia's only naval facility outside the former Soviet Union is on the Syrian coast.If it had been implemented, the cease-fire deal would have created a joint US-Russian center to coordinate military and intelligence operations. President Barack Obama had overruled Pentagon objections to such cooperation and Secretary of State John Kerry made the offer.According to a senior US official, the Pentagon has ordered troops who had been deployed to set up the joint implementation center -- fewer than 20 -- to return to their bases. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.The suspension will not affect communications between the two countries aimed at keeping their planes from bumping into each other over Syria.In Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova voiced regret about the US move and blamed Washington for the failure to persuade the moderate Syrian rebels it backs to cut ties with extremist groups.""And now, after failing to fulfill the agreements they worked out themselves, they are trying to shift the blame,"" she said.The US had agreed to separate the rebel groups but noted it was an extremely slow process. The US has relatively few personnel on the ground in Syria and even the moderate rebels have said they are frustrated with the pace of US help.Putin's decree on plutonium cited the ""emerging threat to strategic stability as a result of US unfriendly actions,"" as well as Washington's failure to meet its end of the cease-fire deal. It said, however, that Russia will keep the weapons-grade plutonium covered under the agreement away from weapons programs.Under the agreement, which was expanded in 2006 and 2010, Russia and the US each were to dispose of 34 metric tons of plutonium, enough material for about 17,000 nuclear warheads. When it was signed in 2000, the deal was touted as an example of successful cooperation between Washington and Moscow.SIGN UP"

Mike Pence and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine is not a fair fight. Pence will dominate -- while the country will worry anew about Hillary Clinton's health, given her replacement.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBack in July, when Clinton and Donald Trump announced their respective running mates, it seemed that the vice presidential debate might actually overshadow the presidential bouts, given that Pence and Kaine have more impressive resumes in public life than either of the people that selected them. Both men have been governors; Pence built a solid reputation as a leader on Capitol Hill, while Kaine was one of the Democrats' more respected voices on foreign policy on the Sunday talk show circuit.But since then, Pence has rocked the campaign trail, while Kaine has been a wet rag. While Pence has played to packed houses across the country, Kaine has struggled to draw anyone at all, even in swing states where the contest is closest.Thus far, Kaine's only noteworthy contributions to his side's efforts have been his repeated, shrill accusations that Donald Trump is associated with the Ku Klux Klan, and his lies defending Clinton on her mis-handling of classified information.Overall, Pence has been a net positive for the Trump campaign, reassuring the public that Trump will a) appoint competent people to high posts, and b) be replaced by a capable leader, should the worst happen.By contrast, Kaine has been a net negative for the Clinton campaign. He seems to have been chosen for the sole reason that he would not overshadow her on stage. In fact, when they appear together, she seems more likely to lose. It is difficult to imagine Kaine running the country.The pattern is unlikely to change on Tuesday. Kaine will be sent onstage with a set of attack lines against Trump to reinforce Clinton's talking points from the last debate. Pence's job will be to look presidential, a task Kaine will make easier for him.The conventional wisdom is that vice presidential debates do not matter much. But they do affect a campaign's momentum.In 2008, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin stunned a skeptical media, which expected her to fail, by outperforming then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE). The result was renewed zeal on the campaign trail for a ticket that appeared to be flagging since the first debate and the disastrous decision of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) to suspend his campaign during the financial crisis.In 2012, Biden put Barack Obama's re-election effort back on track after the president was beaten badly by Gov. Mitt Romney in the first debate. Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, who had prepared well for a genteel battle of wits and policies, was stunned by Biden's antics and outbursts, which seemed clownish but successfully conveyed contempt for Ryan to a national audience.Pence will not only give the Trump campaign a boost, but also force the media to consider, once again, Hillary Clinton's health issues, which remain shrouded in mystery, as well as her judgment, which Trump has repeatedly called into question.That, in turn, will set Trump up for the remaining two debates -- and, perhaps, for one last, and decisive, surge in the polls.Joel B.

But as he sets his mind to the upcoming debate, the Indiana Governor and VP candidate took time out to slam Kaine for his failures.The governor said he was looking forward to meeting Kaine to compare records. But he went on to give the crowd a first peek at some of his tactics, telling them Kaine wanted to raise taxes by ""four billion."" He also slammed Kaine for failing to pass an important roads bill.In contrast, Pence noted that in Indiana, the ""crossroads of America,"" he ""signed into law $2.5 billion in roads and bridges and infrastructure.""""He left the state $2 billion in the hole,"" Pence said of Kaine's record.

Speaking of Hillary Clinton, he also told his supporters that the Democrats had ""nominated someone with a stale agenda and the most predictable of names.""Pence indulged in a little bit of media bashing, as well.""The media is so busy parsing every word that Donald Trump said in the last thirty minutes, they've been ignoring what the Clintons have been up to for the last thirty years,"" Pence has said.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"
