The bill permits them to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for the kingdom's alleged backing of the 19 hijackers who carried out the plot. Saudi Arabia is staunchly opposed to the measure.Senators voted 97-1 to override Obama's veto. The lone ""no"" vote was Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.A House vote on Obama's veto was expected later in the day Wednesday. If the House also overrides, the bill becomes law. During his nearly two terms in office, Obama has never had a veto overridden by Congress.Despite reversing Obama's decision, several senators said defects in the bill could open a legal Pandora's box, triggering lawsuits from people in other countries seeking redress for injuries or deaths caused by military actions in which the U.S. may have had a role.In a letter delivered Tuesday to Senate leaders, Obama said the bill would erode sovereign immunity principles that prevent foreign litigants ""from second-guessing our counterterrorism operations and other actions that we take every day.""But one of the bill's leading proponents, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, dismissed Obama's concerns as ""unpersuasive."" Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, and other supporters said the bill is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on U.S. soil.""This bill is about respecting the voices and rights of American victims,"" Cornyn said.Families of the victims and their attorneys disputed concerns over the legislation as fearmongering aimed at derailing the legislation that they have long urged Congress to pass.Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, one of the Democrats who broke with Obama and voted to override, said ""the risks of shielding the perpetrators of terrorism from justice are greater than the risks this legislation may pose to America's presence around the world.""The legislation gives victims' families the right to sue in U.S. court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi nationals. Courts would be permitted to waive a claim of foreign sovereign immunity when an act of terrorism occurs inside U.S. borders, according to the terms of the bill.Still, a group of national-security minded legislators pledged to discuss how to repair problem areas during the upcoming lame-duck session of Congress. But the fact that legislation could pass both chambers of Congress without closer scrutiny left at least a few senators chiding themselves for not examining more closely the bill's potential ramifications.The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, moved to the floor of the Senate in May and passed by voice vote. The bill cleared the House earlier this month, also by voice vote.""We didn't pay much attention to this,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. ""And boy is that ever a lesson learned.""Obama vetoed the measure last week, telling lawmakers the bill would make the U.S. vulnerable to retaliatory litigation.In his letter to Reid, the president said other countries could attempt to use JASTA to justify similar immunity exceptions to target U.S. policies and activities that they oppose.""As a result, our nation and its armed forces, State Department, intelligence officials and others may find themselves subject to lawsuits in foreign courts,"" Obama wrote. As an example, U.S. troops, including those involved in counterterrorism operations, ""would be vulnerable to accusations that their activities contributed to acts that allegedly violated foreign laws,"" the president said.In a separate letter sent Monday to a senior House member, Defense Secretary Ash Carter described the potential for foreign litigants to seek classified intelligence data and analysis and sensitive operational information to establish their cases in what could be an ""intrusive discovery process.""If the U.S. were sued overseas, a foreign court would decide whether the information should be protected from disclosure, he said in the letter to Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Paradoxically, the information could be central to a defense against the accusations.""Disclosure could put the United States in the difficult position of choosing between disclosing classified or otherwise sensitive information or suffering adverse rulings and potentially large damage awards for our refusal to do so,"" Carter wrote.Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., voiced his numerous concerns with the bill before the vote but decided to override the president's veto anyway.""I do so understanding that there could be in fact unintended consequences that work against our national interests,"" said Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Missing the vote were Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Tim Kaine, D-Va.SIGN UP"

Blake Farenthold (R-TX) posed at a House Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday focused on oversight of FBI operations.Although the FBI director acknowledged he found ""evidence"" that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton might have violated laws pertaining to the handling of classified information, he determined earlier this year there was insufficient proof of intent to prosecute her.He came to that conclusion after finding that Clinton acted ""extremely carelessly"" in handling classified information on her private email as President Barack Obama's Secretary of State.On Wednesday, Rep. Farenthold asked:How do you respond to people who are saying that this is not how an average Americans would be treated, this only how Hillary Clinton would be treated?The FBI director said in responding:Jane and Joe Smith would not be prosecuted on these facts. Now you'd be in trouble, that's the other thing I've had to explain to the FBI workforce. If you use an unclassified email system to do our business and in the course of doing our business talk about classified topics, you would be in big trouble with the FBI. I'm highly confident of that. I'm also highly confident, in fact certain, you would not be prosecuted.In a joking manner, Rep. Farenthold suggested he would cite Comey's response if he were to get in trouble for mishandling classified information.Something similar is already occurring in the court rooms.""I'm confident that you wouldn't [be prosecuted]... Don't do it. Don't do it, but I guess I can't control Congress. If you work for us don't do it,"" reiterated Comey in response to the Congressman's question, later adding:You can call us wrong. You can call me a fool. You cannot call us weasels, okay. That is just not fair. We hopefully have not gotten to a place in public life where everything has to be torn down on integrity basis just to disagree. You can disagree with this -- there is just not a fair basis for saying that we did it [handled Clinton's email scandal] in any way that wasn't honest and independent.Some government employees, including members of the military, have been prosecuted in connection to cases similar to the one that involved Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.A lawyer representing Maj. Jason Brezler, a decorated U.S. Marine who is being discharged for sending classified information on his personal email account, has now said he intends to cite the precedent set by Clinton's case as part of his defense approach.Meanwhile, U.S. Navy Petty Officer First Class Kristian Saucier cited the Hillary Clinton precedent in his defense, but was still convicted on a felony charge for taking photos of classified systems inside a submarine and sentenced to one year in prison and a $100 fine.In July, Comey said that it would be a ""double standard"" to prosecute Clinton.The director elaborated on that point when questioned by Farenthold.Without explicitly denying the existence of new evidence, Comey maintained Wednesday that Clinton did not break any laws, adding that he is not planning on reopening the FBI case against her.Comey's entire response to the Republican Congressman's question about whether average Americans would be treated any differently by the FBI if they mishandled classified information in the same manner that she did:When people tell you that, that others have been treated differently, demand from a trustworthy source the details of those cases. Because I made a very aggressive investigator, I was a very aggressive prosecutor. I have gone back through 40 years of cases and I'm telling you under oath that to treat- to prosecute on these facts, would be a double standard because Jane and Joe Smith would not be prosecuted on these facts. Now you'd be in trouble. That's the other thing I've had to explain to the FBI workforce. You use an unclassified email system to do our business and in the course of doing our business talk about classified topics, you would be in big trouble with the FBI. I'm highly confident of that. I'm also highly confident, in fact certain, you would not be prosecuted. That's what folks tend to lump together.How do you respond to people who are saying that this is not how an average Americans would be treated, this only how Hillary Clinton would be treated?Jane and Joe Smith would not be prosecuted on these facts.

(For those who stopped watching boxing when Iron Mike Tyson became a cannibal, here's a quick refresher: During a professional prizefight, three judges score who won each round, with the victor getting 10 points and the loser getting nine.  If the fight doesn't end by knockout, then the judges' cards are tabulated after the final round, and the boxer with the most points is declared the victor.)But that's not how elections work.Elections aren't decided by adding-up a series of little things; they're decided by our lasting, long-term impressions of each candidate - i.e. who they are, why they're running, what they believe in, and what they care about.They're decided by big things.Consider: We don't cast ballots immediately after a TV debate.  Instead, we turn-off the television and go to bed.This is critically important when determining who ""won"" a presidential debate, and the reason why Luntz's methodology is a useless evaluator of a candidate's performance: It evaluates the wrong metrics.Donald Trump's goal isn't to win a second-by-second comparison with Hillary Clinton.  It's not to out-jab Clinton on policy points.  And it's not to get random voters to click one way or another on Luntz's machine.Trump's goal is to position his candidacy for victory in November.  Nothing more, nothing less - and if you're missing this distinction, then you're analyzing the wrong metrics.Trump's genius is in branding.  He's probably the best branding expert in modern political history.  He's astonishingly good at it.Jeb Bush is ""low energy.""  Donald Trump is a ""winner.""  Ted Cruz is ""lyin'.""  Hillary Clinton is ""crooked.""  Marco Rubio is ""little"" and a ""choker.""We could argue about the accuracy of his branding, but that's irrelevant.  Political campaigns are a perception-driven enterprise.  And in the first presidential debate, Donald Trump out-branded Hillary Clinton.It wasn't even close.Throughout the GOP primaries, all the so-called political experts on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and the major networks were dumbfounded: How is it that Trump could perform so poorly in the dozen-or-so TV debates, yet continue to win when ballots are cast?  The New York billionaire never won a debate in the eyes of these experts - but inexplicably kept winning elections!  What gives?It's because Trump recognizes that the goal isn't to ""win"" a second-by-second, or minute-by-minute, or point-by-point policy debate.  It's to brand yourself - and also brand others - in a way that positions your candidacy for electoral success.In the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton won a healthy plurality of the minute-by-minute political barbs, especially in the second-half.  She had Trump on the defense.  She stuck to her talking points like her husband sticks to an intern; Trump went off-message and was prone to rambling.So if you were scoring this debate like Luntz did - or if you were scoring it like a Las Vegas boxing judge - then Hillary Clinton won in a landslide.But ask yourself this question: How did Trump brand himself?Well, he's certainly the nontraditional candidate on the ballot.  He's new.  He's an outsider.  He's exciting.  He doesn't talk or act like a traditional politician.  He's a businessman - and he strongly believes that America is heading in the wrong direction, and desperately needs change.How was Hillary Clinton branded?She's the politician who has been talking about the same issues for 30 years... without solving any of them.  She's a member of the political elite.  She talks and sounds just like all the other politicians.  She's smug, smart and self-satisfied, and clearly believes that those of us who are not members of the political elite are beneath her.Yes, Hillary Clinton is prepared - but she's prepared to continue the status quo.Now, ask yourself: After the debate, which of these aforementioned brand attributes were cemented?For Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump... pretty much all of 'em.In politics - and in branding - it's not what you say, but how you make people feel.Trump understands this.  He's a genius at destination branding.This is why Trump tends to do poorly when people like Luntz grade a debate mere moments after it's over, but does much better a few days later, when voters can reflect on their impressions: When we remember all that what was said and done, we recall the emotive elements more clearly than the second-by-second comparisons.Earlier in the primaries, it didn't really matter if Jeb Bush out-talked Donald Trump on policy points.  What mattered was the long-term branding that Trump cemented: Jeb Bush is a boring, low-energy legacy politician, whereas Donald Trump is the fresh-thinking outsider, a savvy, successful businessman, and an Alpha Male with an insatiable desire to make America great again.A similar fate befell Ted Cruz - which was remarkable, because the Texas Senator is an enormously skillful point-by-point debater.  But because of Trump, Ted Cruz - the Tea Party Darling, and stalwart, lifelong conservative who had won arguments before the Supreme Court - was transformed into Lyin' Ted,  a nasty, petty, argumentative fink who doesn't get along with anyone and can't get anything done on Capitol Hill.(Again, this isn't intended as a knock on Cruz or Bush; it's simply noting the potency of Trump's branding.)Political pundits in the mainstream media love to bloviate about a candidate's gender-gap with women, presumably because most of the time, it's the Republican candidate who is trailing.  (You've probably noted that these pundits rarely mention when the Democratic candidate has a similar-sized gender-gap with males.)  But the 2016 election is all about a different kind of gap.This is the gap that will decide the election: An empathy gap.Long after the debate is over, you ""feel"" that Trump understands that the country is headed in the wrong direction.  You ""feel"" that Trump is genuinely outraged by America's decline, and come hell or high water, he'll dedicate his presidency to making America great again.  You ""feel"" that Trump is an authentic, one-of-a-kind outsider with unbridled bravado. You ""feel"" that Trump will shake-up the status quo and implement real, long-lasting changes.  From immigration to trade, from waging war on ISIS to renegotiating trade bills, from creating jobs to restoring law and order, Donald Trump ""feels"" what we feel.That's the brand he built - and is continuing to build.It's an eye-popping contrast to the brand Hillary Clinton is building (both on her own and with Trump's support): Hillary is the ultimate DC insider who knows everything better than we do.  She looks down on people like us.  Yes, she knows all of the issues and all of the problems facing our country... but only because she's been talking about them for 30 years, instead of actually solving them.  She deserves the White House, dammit... and shame on those racist, sexist, xenophobic ""deplorables"" for making her work so hard for it!Her utter lack of empathy is Mrs. Clinton's fatal flaw: We don't care how much she knows, because we know she doesn't care about us.On a visceral, emotive level, we've felt this all along about Hillary.  It's why a junior senator from Illinois came out of nowhere and beat her in 2008.  It's why an over-aged socialist nearly toppled her in 2016: Say what you want about Bernie Sanders, but he was 100 percent authentic in his beliefs - because he genuinely desired to transform America.But Hillary Clinton is all about Hillary Clinton.  Always has been.  Always will be.Donald Trump won the debate, but only if you know what you're looking for.SIGN UP"

And I can prove it.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAs we shall see, when Democrats must choose between their old loyalty, providing jobs for workers, and their new loyalty, favoring politically-correct constituency groups--they choose the PC groups.Indeed, the old assumptions about the Democrats as the party of labor are nowadays so tangled and conflicted that the unions themselves are divided. Some unions are sticking with their blue-collar heritage, but more are aligning themselves with the new forces of political correctness--and oh, by the way, big money.The proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, running through four states--from western North Dakota to southern Illinois--would create an estimated 4,500 unionized jobs.  That is to say, good jobs at good wages: The median entry-level salary for a pipeline worker in North Dakota is $38,924.Yet the advancement of what was once called the ""labor movement"" is no longer a Democratic priority.  The new priorities are heeding the goals of ""progressive"" groups--in this instance, Native Americans and the greens. Indeed, this new progressive movement is so strong that even many unions are climbing aboard the bandwagon, even if that means breaking labor's united front.To illustrate this recent rupture, here's a headline from the The Huffington Post: ""Dakota Access Pipeline Exposes Rift In Organized Labor."" Let's let Huffpo labor reporter Dave Jamieson set the scene:The nation's largest federation of labor unions upset some of its own members last week by endorsing the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota. Some labor activists, sympathetic to Native American tribes and environmentalists, called upon the AFL-CIO to retract its support for the controversial project.In response to the criticism, Sean McGarvey, head of the AFL-CIO's building-trades unions, fired right back; speaking of pipeline opponents, McGarvey declared that they have......once again seen fit to demean and call for the termination of thousands of union construction jobs in the Heartland.  I fear that this has once again hastened a very real split within the labor movement.Yes, it's become quite a fracas within the House of Labor: so much for the old slogan, ""Solidarity Forever!"" We can note that typically, it's the old-style construction unions--joined, perhaps, by other industrial workers, if not the union leadership--who support construction projects, while the new-style public-employee unions side with the anti-construction activists.In the meantime, for its part, the Democratic Party has made a choice: It now firmly sides with the new progressives. To cite just one 'frinstance, we can examine the July 2016 Democratic national platform, released at the Philadelphia convention. That document includes a full 16 paragraphs on ""climate change,"" as well as 14 paragraphs on the rights and needs of ""indigenous tribal nations."" Here's one of those paragraphs; as we can readily see, Democrats are striving mightily to synthesize the demands of both groups, green and red:We are committed to principles of environmental justice in Indian Country and we recognize that nature in all its life forms has the right to exist, persist, maintain, and regenerate its vital cycles. We call for a climate change policy that protects tribal resources, protects tribal health, and provides accountability through accessible, culturally appropriate participation and strong enforcement. Our climate change policy will cut carbon emission, address poverty, invest in disadvantaged communities, and improve both air quality and public health. We support the tribal nations efforts to develop wind, solar, and other clean energy jobs.By contrast, the Democratic platform included a mere two skimpy paragraphs on workers and wages.Some Democrats are troubled by this shift in priorities, away from New Deal-ish lunch-bucket concerns--because, as a matter of fact, it's a shift away from the very idea of economic growth. For example, William Galston, a top White House domestic-policy aide to Bill Clinton in the 90s, had this to say about the Democrats' latest platform:The draft is truly remarkable--for example, its near-silence on economic growth. . . . Rather, the platform draft's core narrative is inequality, the injustice that inequality entails, and the need to rectify it through redistribution.A few days later, another Democrat, urban geographer Joel Kotkin, went even further:Increasingly, liberals, or progressives, are at best ambivalent about economic growth, particularly in such blue-collar fields as fossil fuel energy, manufacturing, agribusiness and suburban homebuilding.Perhaps it seems strange that a political party would lose interest in such an obvious political staple as economic growth. And yet if we look more closely, we can see, from the perspective of the new Democrats, that this economic neglect makes a kind of sense: We can note, for example, that the financial heart of the green movement is made up of billionaires; they have all the money they need--and, thanks to their donations, they have a disproportionate voice.One of these noisy green fat cats is San Francisco's Tom Steyer, who contributed $50 million to Democratic campaigns in 2014 and has been spending heavily ever since. We can further point out: If Steyer chooses to assign a higher value to his eco-conscience than to jobs for ordinary Americans, well, who in his rarified Bay Area social stratum is likely to argue with him?Admittedly, billionaires are few in number--even in the Democratic Party. Yet at the same time, many other groups of Democratic voters aren't necessarily concerned about the vagaries of the economy, because they, too, in their own way, are insulated from its ups and downs. That is, they get their check, no matter what.The most obvious of these groups, of course, are government employees. Some of them, especially in the military and in law enforcement, might well be Republicans. Yet on the whole, public-sector workers have an obvious class-interest in voting Democratic, and they know it--lots of Lois Lerners in this group.Then there are the recipients of government benefits. And here we can immediately stipulate that there's a critical, perhaps even binary, distinction to be drawn--between those who have earned their benefits through work, and those who have not.In the ""earned"" category are the beneficiaries of Security Security and other forms of work-related pensions, such as veterans benefits. For these folks, having spent decades in the workforce, the values of delayed gratification and thrift are likely ingrained in them, and this shapes their outlook in later life--whichever party they might identify with.Meanwhile, in the ""unearned"" category are those who, for lack of a better word, get their money for free--their benefits, however desperately they might be needed, are unearned. And all available evidence tells us that this latter group has a much different mindset, and thus a much different political outlook. So as not to be coy about this point, we can just say it: welfare recipients, for example, are overwhelmingly Democratic. And Democratic politicians, of course, know this electoral calculus full well.Indeed, in this era of slow economic growth, nearly 95 million Americans over the age of 16 are not in the labor force; not all of them are receiving a check from the government, but most are. And that has political consequences.We can take this reality--economic stagnation on the one hand, economic dependence on the other--a step further: If the Democrats can find the votes they need from the plutocrats and the poor--or near-poor, plus public employees--then they can make a strategic choice: They can ignore the interests of working-class people in the private sector, and they can still win.So for this cynical reason, the Democrats' decision to stiff the working stiffs who might have worked on the Dakota pipeline was an easy one.We can sum up the Democrats' strategy more concisely: In socioeconomic terms, they will go above the working class, and also below the working class. That is, they will be the party of George Soros and Al Sharpton. So no room, anywhere, for the blue collars. (Of course, if any of those would-be pipeline workers end up on public assistance, well, they'll have a standing offer to join the Democratic fold.)We can see this Soros-Sharpton coalition in America's electoral geography: The Democrats expect to sweep the upper east side of Manhattan, and, at the same time, they expect to sweep the south side of Chicago. Moreover, this high-low pattern appears everywhere: Greenwich and the ghetto, Beverly Hills and the barrio.  In addition, Democrats can expect to do well in upper-middle class suburban enclaves, as well as college towns. And so if we add all those blocs together, plus the aforementioned public-employee unions, we can see that the Democrats have their coalition--quite possibly, it's a 2016 victory coalition.So now can see the logic of the logic of the Democrats' policy choices.  And we can even add an interesting bit of backstory to the Democrats' 2016 platform. In June, as a concession to the insurgency of Sen. Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton's campaign agreed to include a contingent of Sanders supporters on the 15-member platform-drafting committee.Specifically, the Clinton camp accepted the Palestinian-American activist James Zogby, the Muslim Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the environmental activist Bill McKibben, the African-American activist Cornel West, and the Native American activist Deborah Parker. And yet as the The Washington Post reported, the Clintonites, working through the Democratic National Committee, rejected another of Sanders' proffered appointees, namely, Roseann DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United.  As the Post explained,The DNC informed the campaign it did not want an additional labor representative on the platform-writing committee, since one already sat on the full platform committee.In other words, the unions got a grand total of one name on that 15-member body. Meanwhile, Democratic elected officials, plus various minorities, donors, and activists occupied the other 14 slots. So we can see: Big Labor isn't so big anymore; it is now reduced to token status within the party.Given this new correlation of forces, it's no surprise that top Democrats oppose the Dakota pipeline. Just on Monday, Barack Obama--having blocked the Keystone Pipeline last year-- indicated that he opposes, as well, the Dakota pipeline. Supportively donned in traditional Indian attire, the President praised the anti-pipeline elements of a Native American conclave for ""making their voices heard.""Indeed, the Dakota pipeline is probably already dead: Protestors, unhindered by federal law enforcement, have already effectively stopped its construction. And on September 16, a federal appeals court ruled against it.Thus we can see that a familiar combination of forces, protestors and litigators, stopped the pipeline--even before Democratic politicians could move in to deliver the coup de grace.Interestingly, one Democratic figure loudly opposed to the pipeline is the same Roseann DeMoro, the head of the nurses' union, who was excluded from the DNC platform earlier this year.  Yet even so, she's fully on board with the new order; as she told The Huffington Post,The environmental movement and the labor movement need to join very strong forces . . . The [AFL-CIO] has to turn the corner in a throwdown on the right type of employment, the right type of jobs, and the right type of planet.  This is a zero-sum game.We can pause over those stern last words: ""This is a zero-sum game."" That is to say, in this new era of green-first politics, the anti-pipeline forces must win, and the pro-pipeliners must lose.For his part, McGarvey, the building-trades union leader, issued an angry response. If union leaders choose to regard ""climate change"" as the ""most pressing issue"" he snapped, they can look to themselves first:I suggest they work within their own industries to do their part to combat the problem and not callously and hypocritically take it out on hard working American AFL-CIO members.Still, it seems a safe bet that McGarvey's lament will not change any minds within the Democratic Party.For her part, Hillary Clinton certainly knows where she stands: She's with the new eco- and multicultural Democrats, not the old unionists--who were, after all, mostly ""deplorable."" As she said to a cheering campaign crowd earlier this year, ""We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""To be sure, Clinton has a heart--a taxpayer-funded heart. In fact, she has offered to put all those soon-to-be ex-coal workers on the government dole; she has proposed a $30 billion program for them.Yet whether or not Congress ever approves that $30 billion, it's a safe bet that if Clinton wins, more fossil-fuel workers will need to find some new way of earning a living. After all, just last year, the Obama administration pledged that the U.S. would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. And whereas Donald Trump has promised to scrap those growth-flattening CO2 targets, Clinton has promised to maintain them.Indeed, during Monday night's debate in New York, she promised to install ""half a billion more solar panels"" as part of her plan, she said, to create 10 million new jobs.We can quickly observe that most blue collars don't seem to trust Clinton with their livelihoods; Trump beats her among non-college-educated men by a whopping 59 points.Yet at the same time, we can add that if Trump leads among blue collars by ""only"" 59 points, that might not be enough for him to overcome Clinton's advantage--her huge strength among the Soros-Sharpton coalition. And here we can note, with some perplexity, that the leadership of the industrial unions is still mostly in lockstep with the Democrats. That residual partisan loyalty to the party of FDR might cost their members their jobs now that the Democrats have found policy goals other than mass employment, but hey, perhaps the union bosses themselves can get jobs at Hillary's Department of Labor.So if Clinton wins this November, what will happen to the private-sector blue collars, especially those in the traditional energy sector?Sadly, we already know the answer to that question; the only unresolved matter is how they might react. In the meantime, even as the election outcome is in doubt, we might venture this grimly tongue-in-cheek suggestion if Clinton wins: If gainful employment is no longer an option, perhaps these newly unemployed workers could start a protest movement--they could call it ""Blue Collar Lives Matter.""Such protesting wouldn't get them back their jobs, of course, but at least they could get a government grant.The nation's largest federation of labor unions upset some of its own members last week by endorsing the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota. Some labor activists, sympathetic to Native American tribes and environmentalists, called upon the AFL-CIO to retract its support for the controversial project....once again seen fit to demean and call for the termination of thousands of union construction jobs in the Heartland.  I fear that this has once again hastened a very real split within the labor movement.We are committed to principles of environmental justice in Indian Country and we recognize that nature in all its life forms has the right to exist, persist, maintain, and regenerate its vital cycles. We call for a climate change policy that protects tribal resources, protects tribal health, and provides accountability through accessible, culturally appropriate participation and strong enforcement. Our climate change policy will cut carbon emission, address poverty, invest in disadvantaged communities, and improve both air quality and public health. We support the tribal nations efforts to develop wind, solar, and other clean energy jobs.The draft is truly remarkable--for example, its near-silence on economic growth. . . . Rather, the platform draft's core narrative is inequality, the injustice that inequality entails, and the need to rectify it through redistribution.Increasingly, liberals, or progressives, are at best ambivalent about economic growth, particularly in such blue-collar fields as fossil fuel energy, manufacturing, agribusiness and suburban homebuilding.The DNC informed the campaign it did not want an additional labor representative on the platform-writing committee, since one already sat on the full platform committee.The environmental movement and the labor movement need to join very strong forces . . . The [AFL-CIO] has to turn the corner in a throwdown on the right type of employment, the right type of jobs, and the right type of planet.  This is a zero-sum game.I suggest they work within their own industries to do their part to combat the problem and not callously and hypocritically take it out on hard working American AFL-CIO members.SIGN UP"

Pinck, who became the president of the OSS Society in 2002.The bill, HR 3929, was filed Nov. 4 by Rep. Robert Latta (R.-OH) and now has 319 co-sponsors. Senators passed their companion bill Feb. 22 by unanimous consent.Under the House rules, the Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy could bring up the non-controversial bill for quick approval with limited debate. This ""suspension of the rules"" requires that the measure pass with a two-thirds majority of congressmen present, 288 out of 435, if all are present.Monday, McCarthy brought up 16 bills under suspension, including a bill to name a courthouse at 300 Fannin Street in Shreveport, Louisiana, as the ""Tom Stagg Federal Building and United States Courthouse"" and a bill to restrict the inclusion of Social Security account numbers on documents sent by mail by the federal government.Although the language of the bill says that the gold medal would be presented to the veterans, in practice, congressional gold medals are a single medal, which is actually kept at the Smithsonian Institute for display and duplicates are authorized for sale by the Treasury Department.The society is the legacy organization of the OSS Veterans Society that was founded in 1947 by Maj. Gen. William J. ""Wild Bill"" Donovan. Donovan led the OSS throughout the war, but President Harry S Truman did not ask him to lead the OSS's successor entity, the Central Intelligence Agency.When President Dwight D. Eisenhower heard Donovan died in 1959, he exclaimed: ""What a man! We have lost the last hero.""Pinck said other special groups from World War II have been recognized for their service, such as the fighter pilots, Doolittle Raiders, the Civil Air Patrol and the Monument Men, who worked with the OSS to recover artworks stolen by the Nazis.""People serving in the OSS never really got a lot of recognition,"" he said.""It was a secret organization and it was only around for three-and-a-half years,"" he said. ""It kind of disappeared, so the people, who served in it, haven't been properly recognized.""There is a quote from Donovan that sums it up, he said. ""He said OSS personnel performed some of the bravest acts of the war, but Americans don't know anything about it.""Beyond the recognition to the veterans, the congressional gold medal would also bring long overdue attention to the achievements and sacrifices of these heroes, he said.Today, there are few veterans left, so the membership is made up of descendants of OSS veterans and members of special operations or other intelligence services communities that trace their origins to the OSS, such as the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, he said. There are also associate members, who have an active interest in the craft and the society.Pinck said at its peak, the OSS had roughly 13,000 personnel worldwide.""If there were more than a couple hundred living OSS veterans around, I'd be surprised,"" he said. ""It is critical that this bill be passed this year, so these folks, frankly, can be alive to receive the honor-if we much longer, none of them are going to be alive.""Pinck said his own father, Dan Pinck, served with the OSS, when as a 19-year-old, he was dropped in Japanese-occupied China with a small team of Nationalist Chinese soldiers.""He actually wrote a wonderful book,"" Journey to Peking: A secret agent in wartime China. ""I am a little biased, because I know the author, but I tell people it's the best intelligence memoir written-ever,"" he said.Pinck's father worked as the only American behind Japanese lines in China, where he built up a network of 60 local operatives from his base in Hong Kong. The young spy reported back to his American bosses troop movements and commercial and military shipping information that led to the sinking of Japanese ships.In preparation for the anticipated invasion of Japan, Pinck's father scouted coastal batteries and possible landing sites for U.S. troops on the coastline of Japanese-held China.""One of the things  he told me about was towards the end of the war, he told me that they discovered that the Japanese were hiding thousands and thousands of gallons of fuel in a school,"" he said. ""He said he was preparing to send the coordinates -'But, if I do that thousands of innocent people are going to be killed,' so he said: 'I can't do that,'"" He never sent in the coordinates.""He had a price on his head, but the Japanese never caught him, Thank God,"" he said.""It had to be a formative and harrowing experience for him,"" he said. ""Imagine doing something like that when you are that young?""There were firefights with the Japanese and other adventures, but Pinck said his father's story is not unique.""A lot of what we do for family members is try to help them find out what their parents or grandparents did in the OSS,"" he said.Among the operations the OSS personnel participated in, OSS Detachment 101 operated in Burma and pioneered the art of unconventional warfare. It was the first United States unit to deploy a large guerrilla army deep in enemy territory. It has been credited with the highest kill:loss ratio for any infantry-type unit in American military history and was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.  Its X-2 branch pioneered counterintelligence with the British and established the modern counterintelligence community. The network of contacts built by the OSS with foreign intelligence services led to enduring Cold War alliances.One of the first American actions of the war was Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942, was aided by the networks established and information acquired by the OSS to guide Allied landings.There was also Operation Halyard rescued more than 500 downed airmen trapped behind enemy lines in Yugoslavia, one of the most daring and successful rescue operations of World War II and OSS ""Mercy Missions"" at the end of World War II saved the lives of thousands of Allied prisoners of war whom it was feared would be murdered by the Japanese.Every year, the society awards its Donovan Award at their annual gala. This year, the award goes to retired Air Force Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, who retired in 2012 as the Air Force Chief of Staff, but as a young pilot joined the airlift out of Saigon in April 1975.SIGN UP"

The Center for American Progress convened calls on mass gun violence--one of a number of efforts to follow through on President Obama's exhortation to revive efforts to enact new controls, such as universal background checks or a ban on assault rifles.* The National Security Network released a new policy report entitled Mainstreaming Hate: The Far-Right Fringe Origins of Islamophobic and Anti-Refugee Politics in their handling of the Syrian refugee resettlement.* The Refugee Council USA and some of its members issued calls to action to safeguard the Syrian refugee resettlement program.After the Lynch event, a second Foundations' memo boasted, ""Appearing at the annual dinner hosted by grantee Muslim Advocates, Attorney General Loretta Lynch vowed that her department would vigorously investigate claims of hate speech that could lead to anti-Muslim violence.""The first document relates a specific rapid response deployment of Foundations grantees to combat calls for restrictions on the visa waiver program after it was made public that Tashfeen Malik, one of the San Bernardino attackers, passed three background checks by U.S. immigration officials and was granted a K-1 visa to immigrate from Pakistan as the fiance of attacker Syed Rizwan Farook.The document reveals:Following the San Bernardino shootings in December by a U.S. citizen and his Pakistani spouse, there were additional proposals to limit the immigration of foreign nationals from specific Muslim countries, including restrictions on the visa waiver program.US Programs' Reserve Fund request, already in pipeline since the Syrian refugee crisis erupted last summer, received tentative approval. This request, which includes both c3 and c4 components, will provide communications capacity and advocacy support to refugee groups. It will also bolster immigrant rights groups' ability to respond to anti-Muslim and anti-refugee rhetoric, which has been prominent in the race for the Republican 2016 presidential nomination.The issue of refugee resettlement is central to the Open Society Foundations' domestic aims. As recently reported by Breitbart News, hacked Soros documents state that the billionaire and his foundation helped to successfully press the Obama administration into increasing to 100,000 the total number of refugees taken in by the U.S. annually. The documents reveal that the billionaire personally sent President Obama a letter on the issue of accepting refugees.Meanwhile, another document, titled, ""ISIS Attacks Aftermath"" and dated November 17, 2015, lamented that ""Tuesday brought a more concerted effort to push back against efforts, fueled by key leaders in Congress and governors in over half the states, to bar Syrian refugees from resettlement in whole swaths of the U.S.""According to that memo, among the prescriptions from grantees was:Cities United for Immigration Action, a coalition of nearly 100 mayors, municipalities and counties organized by New York City's Bill de Blasio, sought to counter the wave of governors opposed to allowing in Syrian refugees with a message of welcome and inclusion. ""We should not close our borders to any group of people fleeing the atrocities and horrors of terrorism,"" said Mayor de Blasio.Yet another document listing grantee response to Islamic State attacks, dated January 7, 2016, addressed grantee opposition activism to the domestic surveillance of Muslims. The actions, the document states, included a lawsuit ""contesting the NYPD's surveillance of Muslims in New Jersey, brought by grantees Muslim Advocates and the Center for Constitutional Rights.""Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Early CCTV images of Cetin holding the gun in Macy's appeared to show a ""hunting type"" rifle with a wooden stock, which is a good description of the Ruger 10/22 he allegedly used to carry out the heinous crime.According to KIRO 7, the mass shooting would not have been curtailed in the slightest by Ferguson's ""assault weapons"" prohibition. This is because the Ruger 10/22 is not an AR-15, AK-47, or other type of ""assault weapon."" Rather, it is a small caliber rifle used ""for hunting small game.""Breitbart News previously reported that Ferguson also wants a ""high capacity"" magazine ban. This would not have prevented the Burlington mass shooting either. After all, the Ruger 10/22 ships with 10-round magazines. And even though Cetin allegedly used an aftermarket 25-round magazine in his rifle, a 10-round magazine would have been more than sufficient to kill five people.The type of gun used in the Burlington attack brings up and interesting point; namely, that AR-15s are not the weapon of choice for mass shooters. Contrary to leftist media claims, there is a vast plurality of weapon types used in mass public attacks. The common thread between all such attacks is the effort that goes into choosing victims who cannot fight back and leveraging the element of surprise.For example, in his latest book, The War on Guns: Arming Yourself Against Gun Control Lies, John R. Lott Jr. explains that Nidal Hasam, the November 5, 2009, Fort Hood attacker, was armed with just a pistol and a revolver, yet was able to fire ""220 shots"" because those at whom he shot were not armed with anything. Think about it: 220 rounds from revolver and pistol. Proof positive that finding gun-free victims and leveraging the element of surprise is far more important than the type of gun an attacker might have in his or her hand.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

""However, American Jews are more pro-choice than pro-Israel when voting.""""This doesn't make American Jews anti-Israel, on the contrary, they perceive the Democratic Party as taking a strong pro-Israel stance, proving that progressive Zionism is not an oxymoron,"" he added. ""Thus, we can say that American Jews are more pro-choice than pro-Israel in the voting booth, but pro-Israel nevertheless.""The study notes that since 1928, the overwhelming majority of U.S. Jews - around 70% - have voted for the Democrat in the presidential elections.""Liberalism worked for Jews in the U.S. It gave them extraordinary opportunities and allowed them to enjoy political freedom,"" Troy told the Jerusalem Post.""The degree to which liberalism and liberal ideas have been good for the Jews in America helps explain why so many American Jews think liberalism and Judaism are the same,"" he said.Barack Obama received 78% of the Jewish vote in 2008 and 69% four years later. In the run-up to 2012 elections, comedian Sarah Silverman released a viral video targeting Jewish voters.""If Barack Obama doesn't become the next president of the United States, I'm gonna blame the Jews ... I am,"" Silverman said in the clip.And I know you're saying like, ""Oh my God, Sarah, I can't believe you're saying this. Jews are the most liberal, scrappy, civil rights-y people there are."" Yes, that's true. But you're forgetting a whole large group of Jews that are not that way, and they go by several aliases. Nana, Papa, Zaide, Bubbe, plain old Grandma and Grandpa. These are the people who vote in Florida. And the Florida vote can make or break an election. If you don't think that's true, why don't you think back to two elections ago when a little man named Al Gore got fucked by Florida.The study also found that even though Jews make up only 2% of the American population, they ""stand out politically because there are disproportionate numbers of Jewish office holders and Jewish activists.""""Since the 1930s, American Jews have been woven into the fabric of the American political landscape. From civil rights to women's rights, Jews have been on the frontier of liberal political movements, spearheading social reforms and shaping American policies from within,"" it said. ""Jews in America are disproportionately wealthy, charitable and politically engaged, making them critical donors standing out both among wealthy donors and among more modest mass donors.""The ""disproportionate"" emphasis on the Jewish vote also hinges on Jewish donations. The study found that in this presidential race, as much as 50% of the Democratic party funds come from Jewish donors and 25% to the Republican party.Troy said both Republican officials and scholars have been baffled by the strong connection American Jews have to the Democratic party.""Many American Jews see their liberalism as part of their Jewish inheritance, along with rags-to-riches stories of success, candlesticks from the Old Country, and grandma's matzoh ball recipe,"" he explained.""Understanding the Jewish vote helps explain American Jewish identity,"" he added. Later in the report, he continued: ""American Jewish liberalism has become a mentality, a sensibility, an ideology, a cultural identity.""And I know you're saying like, ""Oh my God, Sarah, I can't believe you're saying this. Jews are the most liberal, scrappy, civil rights-y people there are."" Yes, that's true. But you're forgetting a whole large group of Jews that are not that way, and they go by several aliases.

I don't think there's any getting around it.""What I thought Trump could have done better at was making clear how stark his differences are with her on several of those issues - notably, as you've been talking about, immigration. It's better on trade, I guess,"" Gaffney said. ""This is the moment where the alternative of change, which is clearly what the American people are looking for, is on offer. And I think if he makes that case even better, in debates to come, he's gonna do fine.""Marlow suggested Trump's slam of the Iran nuclear deal as ""one of the worst in history"" was the sort of moment Trump needs more of, given Clinton's inability to respond effectively to the criticism.""There were a number of places where he would have had her really on the ropes, had he pressed the attack or been given the opportunity by Lester Holt to press the attack,"" Gaffney agreed.""Look, the Iran deal, as you know, Alex - Breitbart News has done a wonderful job covering this, as has my colleague Fred Fleitz at the Center for Security Policy,"" he said, continuing:This is national security fraud, of an epic character. And Hillary Clinton's involvement in it, her support for it, her complicity in the Congress going along with it, in a fashion - I mean, these are very powerful indictments, I believe, for a woman who runs on her record of having been this great maven of national security. Ain't so.The conversation turned to the impending handover of Internet control to a foreign body, a topic that should be of major concern to American voters, although Marlow sarcastically observed there was no time for it during the debate because moderator Lester Holt thought it was more important to discuss Donald Trump's thoughts on Barack Obama's birth certificate.""A lot of people in this audience have absolutely no clue why we would do this and can't even interpret what Obama and the globalists are thinking,"" Marlow said.""Well, quite frankly, I'm among them. I can't figure out what the argument is for doing this,"" Gaffney replied. He went on to explain the situation:What they're preparing to do is to cede, or surrender, the last vestige of American control, or even influence, over what is done with critical functions of the Internet. It gets pretty arcane, but the point is, if you think that the freedom of the Internet - whether it's the ability of people to communicate freely information on it, or whether you think of it as an engine for free enterprise, let alone if you understand the contribution that it makes these days to national security - including, by the way, the operations of our critical infrastructure - you will understand that the United States retaining a measure of quality control as to what's going on with how the Internet is populated with names and numbers, domains, websites and the like, is a very important thing.And for absolutely no good reason, other than people - or countries, I should say, like Russia, and China, and Saudi Arabia, and Iran, and North Korea - don't want us to have any say in this and would like to be able to change things around so that they cannot only restrict all the things the Internet does to help their own people become familiar with the terrible they're being subjected to, at the hands of their totalitarian or authoritarian regimes, but they want to take those freedoms - freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of enterprise - away from us, as well.So this is what it comes down to, Alex: there's no good reason for doing this, certainly not in the next three days, which is what's going to happen unless Congress intervenes.And there's an interesting point here: Hillary Clinton could make all the difference on whether that happens or not.Gaffney agreed with Marlow's criticism of how this vital issue was bypassed at the debate, adding that he was hoping Trump would ""jump in on it because he's taken the right line.""""He said don't give this up. Don't surrender something that is really an instrument of American power - really, when you think of it, sovereignty - especially for no good reason,"" Gaffney noted.

I don't think there's any getting around it.This is national security fraud, of an epic character. And Hillary Clinton's involvement in it, her support for it, her complicity in the Congress going along with it, in a fashion - I mean, these are very powerful indictments, I believe, for a woman who runs on her record of having been this great maven of national security.

It gets pretty arcane, but the point is, if you think that the freedom of the Internet - whether it's the ability of people to communicate freely information on it, or whether you think of it as an engine for free enterprise, let alone if you understand the contribution that it makes these days to national security - including, by the way, the operations of our critical infrastructure - you will understand that the United States retaining a measure of quality control as to what's going on with how the Internet is populated with names and numbers, domains, websites and the like, is a very important thing.
And for absolutely no good reason, other than people - or countries, I should say, like Russia, and China, and Saudi Arabia, and Iran, and North Korea - don't want us to have any say in this and would like to be able to change things around so that they cannot only restrict all the things the Internet does to help their own people become familiar with the terrible they're being subjected to, at the hands of their totalitarian or authoritarian regimes, but they want to take those freedoms - freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of enterprise - away from us, as well.
So this is what it comes down to, Alex: there's no good reason for doing this, certainly not in the next three days, which is what's going to happen unless Congress intervenes.
And there's an interesting point here: Hillary Clinton could make all the difference on whether that happens or not.If every one of your impressive audience - and I do think of you as a hotshot, I don't care what they say - this audience is important, and if they will come up on the net, today, with calls into Mitch McConnell urging him not to give up the Internet - don't let this happen, make sure the Continuing Resolution doesn't permit that.Let's call out Hillary Clinton, to find out whether she supports Barack Obama in diminishing our country, undermining our friends and our own interests, and emboldening our enemies.

And I think if he makes that case even better, in debates to come, he's gonna do fine.""Marlow suggested Trump's slam of the Iran nuclear deal as ""one of the worst in history"" was the sort of moment Trump needs more of, given Clinton's inability to respond effectively to the criticism.""There were a number of places where he would have had her really on the ropes, had he pressed the attack or been given the opportunity by Lester Holt to press the attack,"" Gaffney agreed.""Look, the Iran deal, as you know, Alex - Breitbart News has done a wonderful job covering this, as has my colleague Fred Fleitz at the Center for Security Policy,"" he said, continuing:This is national security fraud, of an epic character.

PRRI finds that 35 percent of Americans raised by divorced parents said they are ""religiously unaffiliated,"" as opposed to only 23 percent who were raised by married parents.PRRI further notes:Rates of religious attendance are also impacted by divorce. Americans who were raised by divorced parents are less likely than children whose parents were married during most of their childhood to report attending religious services at least once per week (21% vs. 34%, respectively). This childhood divorce gap is also evident even among Americans who continue to be religiously affiliated. Roughly three in ten (31%) religious Americans who were brought up by divorced parents say they attend religious services at least once a week, compared to 43% of religious Americans who were raised by married parents.The study also finds that religious diversity in the home is also associated with higher rates of disaffiliation. Americans raised in interfaith families are more likely to say they are unaffiliated than those raised by parents of the same faith, 31 percent vs. 22 percent, respectively.PRRI - along with the Religion News Service - conducted the survey with 2,201 Americans between July 27 and August 9, 2016.Researchers Dr. Betsy Cooper, Dr. Daniel Cox, Rachel Lienesch, and Dr. Robert Jones note the study's results in the context of the ""rise of religiously unaffiliated Americans."" They observe that, in 1991, only six percent of Americans described their religious affiliation as ""none,"" but by the end of the 90s, 14 percent were ""unaffiliated."" In 2012, that category was claimed by 20 percent of Americans and, now, a full 25 percent say they are without religious affiliation - making that group ""the single largest 'religious group' in the U.S.""""The growing ranks of religiously unaffiliated Americans have been fed by striking simultaneous losses among white Christian groups,"" says Jones, PRRI CEO and author of The End of White Christian America. ""The religiously unaffiliated now outnumber Catholics, white mainline Protestants, and white evangelical Protestants, and their growth has been a key factor in the transformation of the country over the last decade from a majority white Christian nation to a minority white Christian nation.""Cox, PRRI research director, especially notes the link between family structure and religious identity.""There is no single reason the unaffiliated are growing so dramatically, but this survey finds new evidence that the structure of family life is part of the story,"" he says. ""Americans raised by divorced parents or by parents in interfaith marriages are less likely than those brought up in two-parent or single-faith households to be religiously active as adults."" Rates of religious attendance are also impacted by divorce. Americans who were raised by divorced parents are less likely than children whose parents were married during most of their childhood to report attending religious services at least once per week (21% vs. 34%, respectively). This childhood divorce gap is also evident even among Americans who continue to be religiously affiliated.

And just like the failed Russian ""reset,"" the Libya war, the Iraq pullout and the Iran deal, it is doomed to failure, and irreversible.At the New York Times, Danielle Kehl of New America's Open Technology Institute attempts to make the best case for the handover. She argues that the U.S. always intended to give up control of ICANN, that ICANN works well enough to be given up, and that the new multi-stakeholder model is preferable to one in which governments exert direct control of ICANN.All of these arguments fall apart rather easily. The U.S. may have intended to give up ICANN when it was created, but it has become a strategic asset, and the U.S. will not break any legal or binding commitment by holding onto it. ICANN does not work well enough to be trusted. Earlier this month, the Free Beacon cited congressional testimony in reporting that ICANN has ""has provided official accreditation to people who have transferred technology to Iran, worked with North Korea, and ordered ""murders-for-hire."" Clearly more needs to be done to strengthen accountability and transparency before any change.As for whether the multi-stakeholder model is preferable to the government-dominated model the rest of the world prefers, that is the same fallacious argument the administration used in pushing the Iran deal -- i.e. allowing Iran to develop nuclear weapons in the future is better than no deal at all. The best alternative of all is the status quo.Congress has only three days to stop Obama's surrender of ICANN.

Here are key facts about him:SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER- Oslo accords -Peres was one of the architects of the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians, reached in 1993 and 1995. The agreements provided for limited Palestinian autonomy and were intended to lead to a final peace agreement.Peres was foreign minister under his Labour party rival Yitzhak Rabin. Both men along with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for their work on Oslo.He was also involved in peace efforts with Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab countries with peace treaties with Israel.Peres never lost faith in the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""I think it's the only thing which is possible in order to bring an end to terror, violence and hatred,"" he said earlier this year in an interview with Time magazine.- Hawk turned dove -Peres was a hawk who later became a dove. He said he was converted after 1977, when Egyptian president Anwar Sadat made a historic visit to Jerusalem, leading to the first Arab-Israeli peace treaty.""I didn't change, I think the situation has changed,"" Peres told Time magazine in an interview published in February.""As long as there was a danger to the existence of Israel, I was what you would call a hawk... The minute I felt the Arabs are open to negotiation, I said that's what we prefer too.""- Founding father -He was seen as Israel's last remaining founding father and held nearly every major office in a career spanning five decades.He was prime minister between 1984 and 1986, then again from 1995-1996 after Rabin's assassination. He served as president, a mainly ceremonial role, from 2007-2014.He also served as foreign, defence and finance minister.- Nuclear efforts -As director general of the defence ministry in the 1950s, he oversaw the development of Israel's nuclear programme with assistance from France.Israel is now considered the Middle East's sole nuclear power, but it has never declared it, maintaining a policy of ambiguity.""Dimona (the site of Israel's nuclear reactor) helped us to achieve Oslo,"" he said in the Time interview.""Because many Arabs, out of suspicion, came to the conclusion that it's very hard to destroy Israel because of it, because of their suspicion. Well if the result is Dimona, I think I was right. Anyway, we?ve never threatened anybody with nuclear bombs, and we?ve never tested it.""- Ben-Gurion as mentor -Born in Poland in 1923, Peres emigrated to what was then British mandatory Palestine when he was 11.He joined the Zionist struggle in the 1940s and met David Ben-Gurion, who would become Israel's first prime minister and Peres's mentor.Elected to parliament in 1959, he served almost without interruption until becoming president in 2007.SIGN UP"

The military and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitoring group, said the army had made some gains, but this was disputed by rebels who said they had held them off.A rebel official said insurgents had advanced against government forces in a separate battle further south, in Hama province.
The rebels took over several villages in Hama's northeastern countryside, building on gains they made nearby on Saturday, said Mohammed Rasheed, a spokesman for the Jaish al-Nasr rebel group.The Observatory also reported the advance.""FEROCIOUS CONFRONTATION""Senior combatants on both sides said pro-government forces were massing in several parts of Aleppo, Syria's biggest city before the war, now divided into a western zone held by the army and a smaller, besieged area held by rebels.The commander of an Iraqi Shi'ite militia fighting in support of Assad told Reuters a large force spearheaded by the army's elite ""Nimr"", or Tiger, forces had started to move in armoured vehicles and tanks for an attack on rebel-held areas.Quelling the uprising in the city would give Assad his biggest victory yet of the war and deliver a powerful blow to his enemies.It is far from clear whether an all-out attempt to storm the rebel-held area is planned soon: that would require a massive assault by the army, backed by Lebanese and Iraqi Shi'ite militias, Iran's Revolutionary Guards and Russian air power.The government's strategy in other locations such as Damascus and Homs has been to use years of siege and bombardment to force eventual surrender, rather than attempting to storm well-defended territory.However, Assad's allies now openly say they have abandoned the peace process and are betting instead on military victory.""There are no prospects for political solutions ... the final word is for the battlefield,"" the leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah Shi'ite movement, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, was quoted in a Lebanese newspaper as saying on Tuesday.The head of Iran's National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, was quoted on Tuesday as saying Aleppo's fate would be determined only ""through a forceful confrontation"".Aleppo residents said the ferocious air attacks of previous nights had abated somewhat.State television reported that the army had retaken al-Farafra district in Aleppo's Old City and engineering units were clearing mines in the area.A senior rebel source said the army had taken some positions near that area, but had been forced to withdraw. Neither assertion could be independently confirmed. The army had also been repelled after heavy fighting in assaults on four other fronts, he said, describing it as the biggest wave of ground attacks since the offensive was announced last week.Zakaria Malahifji, a politburo member of the Fastaqim group which is active in Aleppo, said the army had assembled infantry and heavy vehicles in a military buildup in the city.""Until today, thank God, attempts to advance have been blocked,"" he added.The senior rebel official said pro-government forces were mobilising near the rebel-held Sheikh Saeed district on the city's southern outskirts, near the location of the heaviest fighting this summer in Aleppo.""They are working to expand on any opening they create,"" said the official from an Aleppo-based rebel faction, citing reports from his fighters.SIGN UP"

Nasrallah said that the conflict raging in Syria wasn't a sectarian conflict between the rival Sunni and Shiite branches of Islam, but one against Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi school.It wasn't Nasrallah's first diatribe against Riyadh that referred to Israel.

Which is a comfort, of sorts. Except, isn't the most worrying part of the story the plain fact that a member of the university faculty considered making that offer in the first place?As Sam Hooper notes here, ""snarling baby-faced SJW"" students are one thing. But when the authorities become complicit in their precious snowflakery it spells cultural disaster:But when professors provide even the option of leaving the classroom when confronted with learning material that arouses anything but positive emotions, they effectively legitimise the idea that words and ideas can cause actual physical harm, that being exposed to contrary viewpoints or shocking information is somehow dangerous, and that avoidance coping (staying away from things that upset you) actually works. In reality, there is no proof for any of these assertions, and many reasons to suspect that they are complete psychobabble hokum.Indeed. The other big problem, of course, is that it threatens to create a generation of graduates manifestly unqualified to perform effectively in their supposed field of expertise: English literature graduates who can't read the more challenging passages of English literature; law graduates who can't cope with murder cases; battlefield archaeology graduates who are triggered by the site of scary bones of people who died horribly.Brendan O'Neill gives some examples of this depressing phenomenon:The trigger-warning trend, rampant on American campuses, is spreading in Britain. Before UCL's warnings about archaeology, Royal Holloway was telling English Lit students that Ovid's poems describe 'domestic violence and other nasty things', so they'd better brace themselves, or maybe avoid Ovid altogether. At Oxford, law students are warned that lectures on sexual violence can be 'distressing' and are given the 'opportunity to leave'. In the future can we expect lawyers to flee the courtroom, screaming for a safe space, whenever murders are discussed or photos of injuries are shown? In the US, students have demanded trigger warnings on everything from The Great Gatsby (contains 'suicide, domestic abuse and graphic violence') to Shakespeare (some of his plays reference rape, murder, torture. Like Titus Andronicus. As a Penn State professor of literature says, 'Everyone is traumatised by Titus').Really, though, if you're an archaeology student specialising in 20th and 21st century conflicts and you can't handle the psychological trauma caused by studying what happened in battles wouldn't the most sensible thing to do be to change course: kitten studies, maybe; aromatherapy; dolphin watching; whale song composition; advanced nurturing and caringness - something like that, maybe?
If they feel stressed, they can 'step outside' for the rest of the class 'without penalty', though they should catch up by copying the notes of another student.

""It will be a catastrophe. Nothing will be as bad as NAFTA, but this one will be close. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP and the destruction and continued destruction of American jobs.

She's done nothing. She had in the Senate -- she had a couple of named bills and she named a post office, and I think that she named a road. she named something. She did nothing and she was terrible.

""Let's see what happens.""Spectators Look on as Trump Addresses RallyThe GOP nominee reflected on his visit to the Little Havana community in Miami earlier and vowed to push for reforms in communist Cuba.""I will be a voice of freedom that includes freedom for people in Cuba,"" he said. ""Cuba is not -- it's not right what's going. It's not right.""""This afternoon I spent a lot of time in Little Havana -- an amazing place.

But when he did respond, he didn't answer the question:BREITBART NEWS: ""Robby, does Secretary Clinton believe that the president should withdraw the TPP?""ROBBY MOOK: ""Secretary Clinton, as she said in the debate, evaluated the final TPP language and came to the conclusion that she cannot support it.""BREITBART NEWS: ""Does she think the president should withdraw it?""ROBBY MOOK: ""She has said the president should not support it.""Obama is attempting to ram TPP through Congress as his last act as president during a lame duck session of Congress. Clinton previously supported the TPP, and called it the ""Gold Standard"" of trade deals. That's something Brazile, the new chairwoman of the DNC who took over after Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) was forced to resign after email leaks showed she and her staff at the DNC undermined the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and in an untoward way forced the nomination into Clinton's hands, openly confirmed in her own interview with Breitbart News in the spin room post debate. Brazile similarly refused to answer if Clinton should call on Obama to withdraw the TPP from consideration before Congress.Read Brazile's full exchange with Breitbart News:BREITBART NEWS: Secretary Clinton says she's opposed to the TPP now, I wanted to see do you think she should call on President Obama to withdraw the TPP from Congress?DONNA BRAZILE: Well, as you know, we had that debate and that conversation during the Democrat platform process. The platform in our party is very, very strong on where we should go on not just the TPP but on trade deals. In terms of President Obama and what he's going to propose on Capitol Hill during the final months of his presidency, I'm sure he's going to continue to push for it.BREITBART NEWS: And how do you reconcile the differences between President Obama's support for it--DONNA BRAZILE: Because Hillary Clinton is our nominee for President of the United States.BREITBART NEWS: And President Obama is the sitting president.DONNA BRAZILE: But she's not a member of the United States Senate. I think Mitch McConnell made it very clear he may take this issue up and may not take it up in the so-called lame duck session. So I think for now President Obama has to work with the Democrats on Capitol Hill, which include Bernie Sanders and others who say they will fight against the TPP.That wasn't all. Mook and Brazile were hardly the only Clinton sycophants who dodged the question. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon dodged it too in a brief exchange with Breitbart News in the spin room.Read Fallon dodging the question here:BREITBART NEWS: On the TPP, Secretary Clinton says she's opposed to it now. Does she believe that President Obama should withdraw the TPP and not push it through in a lame duck session of Congress?BRIAN FALLON: She is against the TPP at any point, including in the lame duck, and she has further said--or our campaign has said--that she would not prioritize or push any effort to reopen it or try to tinker around the edges to try to salvage it even if she's the president in January.BREITBART NEWS: So does she think that the president should withdraw it since she's opposed to it in the lame duck anyway?BRIAN FALLON: I think that she's been clear in her position that no matter when it comes up, in the lame duck or whenever, she would be against it personally--and she would urge others to defeat it. And she's certainly not going to bring it up to push it if she's in office in January.BREITBART NEWS: Has she had any conversations with the president asking him to withdraw it?BRIAN FALLON: I'm not aware. I'm not aware of that.This all came after during Monday evening's debate, in his response to the opening question on the economy, Trump catapulted trade policy right to the front of the discussion:Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.""During the debate, Clinton falsely claimed she never called the Pacific Rim trade pact that includes such nations as the Sharia Law-compliant Brunei and the child labor abuser Vietnam among other countries the ""gold standard.""""Now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" Trump fired at Clinton during the debate. ""You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.""Here's what happened next:HILLARY CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...DONALD TRUMP: You called it the gold standard.(CROSSTALK)DONALD TRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.HILLARY CLINTON: No.DONALD TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.HILLARY CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...DONALD TRUMP: Not.HILLARY CLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book...Clinton's claim that she never called it the gold standard of trade deals is a demonstrable lie. Fact checkers from Breitbart News to the Washington Post and more proved she lied, because she didn't just hope it would be the gold standard but she said it was the gold standard.""This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field,"" Clinton said of the deal back in 2012 while in Australia, one of the member countries. ""And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.""In addition to Clinton's lies on TPP, her decision to finally--for the first time this election cycle--defend the highly controversial North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) trade deal that her husband signed into law puts her on her heels in middle America.When Trump told her that ""your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry,"" Clinton replied curtly with attitude: ""Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion."" When asked to respond to Mook's dodging of these questions, and to Hillary Clinton's ambivalence on TPP, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) told Breitbart News in the spin room that Hillary Clinton should call on President Obama to withdraw the TPP--and that he should do so. Sessions said:Well, President Obama should withdraw it and she should call for it to be withdrawn. President Obama is not going to withdraw it. She was involved in the early drafting of it. She said 40 times favorable comments about it. And for her to suggest that she sort of had anything other than a political conversion is totally false. Hillary Clinton's view was totally for that treaty until Donald Trump talked to the American people about the flaws in it. It's impacting, adversely, working people. And then she flip flopped, but she left the door wide open so if she's president she can make a few cosmetic changes and then move it through the Senate. That's exactly what's at stake on that issue.Sessions added that he thought Clinton's claims that she opposes TPP--and that she never called it the ""gold standard""--""were disingenuous."" Sessions told Breitbart News:There's no doubt about it. She helped write that as Secretary of State--she wasn't there when the final draft was completed and she was saying nothing but fine things about it. At least 40 times, she praised the treaty and did call it the 'gold standard' of treaties--but then when the heat got on, she backed off some. But she's never really backed off the possibility with a few cosmetic changes she could move that treaty forward.Trump campaign manager KellyAnne Conway, told of Mook's, Brazile's, and Fallon's decision to dodge Breitbart News's question about the TPP, said in the spin room that it's time for Hillary Clinton to step forward and answer the TPP questions. Conway said in a brief interview:It's really such an excellent question, Matt, I'm glad you asked it. It goes to something Donald Trump said early on in tonight's debate where he said 'are you saying that President Obama was wrong? Are you saying he's wrong?' And Hillary Clinton just gave a glib smile and didn't answer the questions, so I hope she answers yours. She once called TPP the 'gold standard.' And then has been against it. She has been known to be a flip-flopper, 66 percent of the country says she's not honest and not trustworthy. They know that she lies for a living on many things. I also--Robby Mook, her campaign manager, refused to answer the question as to whether Hillary Clinton still supports sanctuary cities. He just didn't answer it. We know that Donald Trump opposes sanctuary cities. It didn't come up in tonight's debate, but sanctuary cities that harbor illegal aliens who then murder Americans is beyond the pale. Donald Trump has stood on the stage with these parents, these angel moms and dads who have lost their children to illegal aliens who had been deported--in the case of Kate Steinle, being murdered in cold blood right in front of her father in San Francisco about two years ago. Kate's Law would be signed into law if Donald Trump was president.On NAFTA, Conway added that ""it sure has"" led to a lot of job loss in America--and that Hillary Clinton's decision to defend it on Monday night is going to harm her in major states across the country because she again keeps running against American workers. Conway went on to say:Donald Trump has been very clear about the downsides of NAFTA, how many jobs we've lost to NAFTA and how many jobs we lost to China and elsewhere. She wanted to defend NAFTA and she had a very unlike Hillary Clinton moment where she said 'I think my husband did very well in the 1990s, you shouldn't mention him at all' because you're supposed to pretend he's not a big part of her campaign or wouldn't be a part of her administration. NAFTA has been a job killer. And part of Donald Trump being able to become the Republican nominee, winning all those contests--part of him being toe-to-toe with her now in the polls and leading in some places like Colorado and Pennsylvania and Ohio, where they've been killed by NAFTA and other trade agreements, that's because he's the guy who's taken it to her and said 'we can't have it anymore. I'm for American workers. I'm going to create American jobs and keep them here in the first place.'Jason Miller, Trump's senior communications adviser, told Breitbart News that Clinton's credibility on trade is next to nothing. Miller told Breitbart News in the spin room:You can't believe anything Secretary Clinton says about TPP. We've seen everyone from Terry McAuliffe to Bill Clinton come out and essentially make clear that yes, she will be someone who supports TPP. I think you will see Secretary Clinton jump and evade and dodge every opportunity to get pinned down on this issue and the fact of the matter is she called TPP the 'gold standard.' This would be another trade deal, maybe not as bad as NAFTA, but another trade deal [that would be bad for the country].Miller added that the Clinton campaign's refusal to answer basic questions from the press about TPP is why Donald Trump is surging everywhere across the country.""There's a reason why we're in the third week of September and we have Pennsylvania, Michigan [getting close] as we saw today the Gravis poll showing in Minnesota we're tied, Mr. Trump is leading in Ohio,"" Miller said. ""It's because these jobs are leaving the country. Hillary Clinton and the status quo--and the rigged system in Washington--are doing nothing to keep those here.""And Robert Graham, the chairman of the Arizona Republican Party, told Breitbart News that Clinton can't come out against NAFTA even though everyone knows how bad it is because it was ""her husband's signature policy.""""So if she does it, she's going to seem disingenuous to her husband,"" Graham told Breitbart News. ""But the reality is exactly what Trump was saying: it's basically outsourcing America with all of these trade policies that are hurting manufacturing. So these swing states, a lot of them even bluer states, wouldn't now a little bit tighter to perhaps even being up for Trump if she would stand up against that policy.""Graham added that Clinton's refusal to stand up on trade until now--when Donald Trump forced her to flip-flop on TPP to now oppose it--is proof that she is ""pathetic.""""It's not convenient to be a leader,"" Graham said. ""The fact that she's being silent on it, and now she's going to start leading when she becomes president? You would hope that she would become a leader now, today. I think that's pathetic.""
BREITBART NEWS: ""Robby, does Secretary Clinton believe that the president should withdraw the TPP?""
ROBBY MOOK: ""Secretary Clinton, as she said in the debate, evaluated the final TPP language and came to the conclusion that she cannot support it.""
BREITBART NEWS: ""Does she think the president should withdraw it?""
ROBBY MOOK: ""She has said the president should not support it.""

BREITBART NEWS: Secretary Clinton says she's opposed to the TPP now, I wanted to see do you think she should call on President Obama to withdraw the TPP from Congress?
DONNA BRAZILE: Well, as you know, we had that debate and that conversation during the Democrat platform process. The platform in our party is very, very strong on where we should go on not just the TPP but on trade deals. In terms of President Obama and what he's going to propose on Capitol Hill during the final months of his presidency, I'm sure he's going to continue to push for it.
BREITBART NEWS: And how do you reconcile the differences between President Obama's support for it--
DONNA BRAZILE: Because Hillary Clinton is our nominee for President of the United States.
BREITBART NEWS: And President Obama is the sitting president.
DONNA BRAZILE: But she's not a member of the United States Senate. I think Mitch McConnell made it very clear he may take this issue up and may not take it up in the so-called lame duck session. So I think for now President Obama has to work with the Democrats on Capitol Hill, which include Bernie Sanders and others who say they will fight against the TPP.

BREITBART NEWS: On the TPP, Secretary Clinton says she's opposed to it now. Does she believe that President Obama should withdraw the TPP and not push it through in a lame duck session of Congress?
BRIAN FALLON: She is against the TPP at any point, including in the lame duck, and she has further said--or our campaign has said--that she would not prioritize or push any effort to reopen it or try to tinker around the edges to try to salvage it even if she's the president in January.
BREITBART NEWS: So does she think that the president should withdraw it since she's opposed to it in the lame duck anyway?
BRIAN FALLON: I think that she's been clear in her position that no matter when it comes up, in the lame duck or whenever, she would be against it personally--and she would urge others to defeat it. And she's certainly not going to bring it up to push it if she's in office in January.
BREITBART NEWS: Has she had any conversations with the president asking him to withdraw it?
BRIAN FALLON: I'm not aware. I'm not aware of that.
Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.
So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.
So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.
But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.""

HILLARY CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...
DONALD TRUMP: You called it the gold standard.
(CROSSTALK)
DONALD TRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.
HILLARY CLINTON: No.
DONALD TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...
DONALD TRUMP: Not.
HILLARY CLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book...

Well, President Obama should withdraw it and she should call for it to be withdrawn. President Obama is not going to withdraw it. She was involved in the early drafting of it.

SIGN UPHEMPSTEAD, New York -- Hillary Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook and other top Democrats refused to answer whether Clinton wants President Barack Obama to withdraw the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) from consideration before Congress during interviews with Breitbart News in the spin room after the first presidential debate here at Hofstra University on Monday night.The fact that Mook, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon, and Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairwoman Donna Brazile each refused to answer the simple question that would prove Clinton is actually opposed to the Trans Pacific Partnership now after praising it 40 times and calling it the ""gold standard"" is somewhat shocking.After initially ignoring the question entirely four separate times, Mook finally replied to Breitbart News. But when he did respond, he didn't answer the question:BREITBART NEWS: ""Robby, does Secretary Clinton believe that the president should withdraw the TPP?""ROBBY MOOK: ""Secretary Clinton, as she said in the debate, evaluated the final TPP language and came to the conclusion that she cannot support it.""BREITBART NEWS: ""Does she think the president should withdraw it?""ROBBY MOOK: ""She has said the president should not support it.""Obama is attempting to ram TPP through Congress as his last act as president during a lame duck session of Congress. Clinton previously supported the TPP, and called it the ""Gold Standard"" of trade deals. That's something Brazile, the new chairwoman of the DNC who took over after Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) was forced to resign after email leaks showed she and her staff at the DNC undermined the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and in an untoward way forced the nomination into Clinton's hands, openly confirmed in her own interview with Breitbart News in the spin room post debate. Brazile similarly refused to answer if Clinton should call on Obama to withdraw the TPP from consideration before Congress.Read Brazile's full exchange with Breitbart News:BREITBART NEWS: Secretary Clinton says she's opposed to the TPP now, I wanted to see do you think she should call on President Obama to withdraw the TPP from Congress?DONNA BRAZILE: Well, as you know, we had that debate and that conversation during the Democrat platform process.
